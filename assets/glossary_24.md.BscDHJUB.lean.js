His maternal grandfather was Alexander Fraser, who served in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. McIntyre was educated in Cornwall and at the University of McGill College. He studied law with James Bethune in Cornwall and then with James Maclennan and Edward Blake in Toronto, and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1872. McIntyre set up practice in Cornwall and then moved to Ottawa in 1875, where he joined the law firm of Walker, McIntyre and Ferguson. In 1881, he became a partner in the law firm of Cockburn and McIntyre. After Cockburn died in 1883, he set up his own law firm of McIntyre and Lewis. McIntyre was solicitor for major local institutions such as the Bank of Montreal and the Civil Service Building Society. McIntyre was elected to represent Corwall in the Ontario assembly in 1875 but his election was overturned after an appeal and he was defeated by John Goodall Snetsinger in the by-election which followed. He ran unsuccessfully for the City of Ottawa seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in 1882 and again in 1887. In 1877, he married Helen Macdonald. McIntyre died in Cornwall in 1914.

The description of this battle can be found in the Book of Exodus.  Battle according to the Bible  According to , following the Jews' escape from Egypt they camped in Rephidim. The battle began with the Amalekites' unprovoked attack against the Jews (Exodus 17:8). Afterwards, Yahweh announced the extermination of the Amalekites and called on Israel to defeat them, stating that Israel would experience peace with their enemies (, ). This was the first of several conflicts over several hundred years between the Amalekites and Jews., ; , ; . Moses urged the faithful to fight and placed his people under the leadership of Joshua. The words, \\"that will hold up the rod of God,\\" could be an expression of his beliefs about impending victory in the coming battle, since they fought under the banner of God. Moses watched from above. When he held his hands up, Israel gained the military advantage. Whenever he put his hands down, according to the Biblical account, they began to lose. The Bible describes how when Moses became tired, his closest relatives, Hur and Aaron, held up his hands for support (). The battle lasted until the evening, ending in victory for the Israelites. The Book of Exodus mentions the curse- punishment thrown at enemies of the chosen people, the Israelites. The Amalekites were to be erased from history. Curses with similar overtones are also recorded in the Book of Jeremiah (Jer 2:3). After the success of the Israeli military, it erected an altar – Yahweh-Nissi (Heb. יְהוָה נִסִּי) – denoting \\"The Lord is my banner.\\" The name refers to the sticks held by Moses.  Research  According to some researchers, Rephidim was the only oasis in the region. It was situated in the mountains where nomads brought cattle to drink. When the Israelites traveled into Canaan, they discovered the Amalekites, who inhabited the northern Sinai Peninsula and the Negev. According to William Petri, Amalekites tried to prevent the Israelites from reaching the oasis. Petri's conclusions are based on his research on climate, which, since the days of Moses, remained almost unchanged. Therefore, he concluded that the number of nomads living there for millennia remained at a similar level, around five to seven thousand people. Taking into account the biblical description of the battle, and the description that its final outcome was not decided until the evening, the number of combatants on both sides are assumed to have been close. It is understood that the Israelites had around six thousand people. The clash resulted in the intruders accessing the oasis. Nineteenth-century Bible scholar and commentator Alexander Łopuchin, interpreted Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 25:17–18) to mean that the Amalekites first laid siege, robbing exhausted travelers who lagged behind the oasis, and then attacked an entire tribe of Israelites. John Van Seters argues that, according to traditional interpretation, a show of hands by Moses was regarded as a sign of prayer; this is significant because the text does not directly mention prayer. Van Seters believed that Moses' gesture, like Joshua's – elevating the javelin (Joshua 8:18–26) – should be understood as the practice of magic, and secondarily as religious. Hans-Christoph Schmitt disputes this view, pointing out that such restrictions would be unlikely. In his opinion, parallels should be sought in 1 Samuel 7:2–13, where Israel is victorious thanks to the constant prayer of Samuel.

Končarević is the author of the \\"Chronicle of the Dalmatian (Orthodox) Bishop Simeon Končarević\\" which is unfortunately lost but which is preserved in the works by Nikodim Milaš. Biography Simeon was born in Karin to a Serbian Orthodox couple, V. Rev. Jovan and Pavlina Končarević. Simeon was educated in Zadar, Venice, and Kyiv Mohyla Academy (now National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy) where he became fluent in Latin, Italian and Russian. He was appointed the parish priest of Benkovac in 1720 by Stevan Ljubibratić, the Serbian Orthodox bishop of Dalmatia (1716–20) who was expelled the same year by the Venetian government on the grounds that he had been invested by a foreign cleric. In Venetian Dalmatia, the Serbian clergy were forced to recognize the local Catholic bishop as their superiors. Serbs had to allow the local Catholic diocesan bishop to visit and inspect, randomly, any Orthodox church and forced the erection of a Roman Catholic altar beside the already existing Orthodox altar (and iconostasis) so that the Catholic services could be conducted at will. Končarević stopped Andrea Balbi, an Italian Catholic bishop, from making such a canonical visitation to the Serbian church in Benkovac by standing at the entrance and brandishing a sabre, in 1728. Due to this, Končarević was imprisoned in a dungeon. After his release, he convoked an assembly of priests on 16 June 1731, the 22 participants deciding that the Serbian Orthodox priesthood did not recognize \\"no Latin bishops\\". The Orthodox clergy petitioned the state and wrote also to the Serbian Patriarch asking to appoint a bishop for Dalmatia. It took two more decades before a bishop was invested. In the meantime, the Dalmatian Serbs put up a valiant fight to preserve their national identity. Eventually, Končarević decided to become a monk in the Krupa monastery on Christmas day in 1751. He was consecrated by Bishop Gavrilo Mihić Mihailović (1741–1752) of the Metropolitanate of Dabar–Bosnia and two other bishops, with the permission of Patriarch Atanasije II Gavrilović of Peć. Exile Being a spokesman and patriot of the people, Bishop Simeon Končarević was expelled from Dalmatia two years later (1753). In a worrying development, the dissatisfied Serb population began to migrate to the neighbouring territory of the Habsburg Empire. Such political unrest and the danger from the Uniates movement caused the departure of hundreds of people from North Dalmatia, under the leadership of Bishop Končarević, to Russia as well. A long time passed until the Serbs in Dalmatia were allowed to have their own bishop. Only under Napoleonic French domination were the Orthodox Serbs allowed to organize their church life and to have their own bishop. Following that dispensation, Metropolitan Benedikt Kraljević (1810–1829), a refugee from Bosnia as well, was appointed Bishop of Dalmatia. Upon the departure of the French, Bishop Benedikt, under heavy pressure from the Austrian authorities and the Roman Catholic Church, gave in to the Union. The Orthodox Serbs refused to accept the Uniate Church, and Bishop Benedikt was forced to abandon the Episcopal Throne. Postscript The Serbs always demanded an Orthodox bishop, instead of a Catholic one, asking for help in this matter from the Metropolitan of Karlovci, Stefan Stratimirović, and pleading to Russia as well. It was all in vain. After the death of Simeon Končarević in 1769, Serbian bishops were not appointed any more because of the constant opposition of the archbishop of Zadar, Mateo Karaman, and of the Dalmatian clergy, which lasted until the fall of the Venetian Republic.

He is on the 2015 Forbes list of 30 scientists under 30 who are changing the world, and has been named one of the \\"brilliant 10\\" people of 2016 by Popular Science magazine.  Early life  Konstantin Batygin was born in Moscow, Soviet Union. His father, Yuri Konstantinovich Batygin, worked as an accelerator physicist in the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute until 1994, when he moved along with his wife Galina and their family to Wakō, Japan, and began working at the particle accelerator facility in RIKEN. There, Konstantin graduated from a public Japanese elementary school, later attending a Russian embassy-based school and studying the martial art Gōjū-ryū. In late 1999, at age 13, Konstantin Batygin moved to Morgan Hill, California along with his family. He chose to attend the University of California, Santa Cruz for the beach and the chance to keep playing in his rock band, The Seventh Season. During his sophomore year as an undergraduate at the university, he met Gregory P. Laughlin at a departmental party, and afterwards they began working together on the Solar System’s long- term dynamical evolution. In June 2008, he graduated from UCSC with a bachelor's degree in astrophysics, and won the Loren Steck Award for his thesis, \\"The Dynamical Stability of the Solar System\\". Batygin subsequently went on to pursue graduate studies at Caltech, obtaining a Ph.D. in Planetary Science in 2012. Career Konstantin Batygin's research is primarily aimed at understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. In 2010, Konstantin Batygin and David J. Stevenson published a calculation, which showed that hot Jupiters can become inflated as a consequence of Ohmic dissipation of electrical currents induced through an interaction between ionized atmospheric winds and the planetary magnetic field. In 2012, Batygin demonstrated that misalignments between stellar spin-axes and planetary orbits can arise from gravitational perturbations exerted onto protoplanetary disks by primordial companions stars. In 2015, Batygin and Laughlin hypothesized that the Solar System once possessed a population of short-period planets that were destroyed by Jupiter's migration through the solar nebula. In January 2016, Konstantin Batygin and Michael E. Brown proposed the existence of a ninth planet in the Solar System. In 2018, Batygin showed that the evolution of astrophysical disks can be modeled with the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics.

Early life Born in Bristol in 1954, he attended Bristol Grammar School and spent time during his childhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He attended Oxford University, reading English Language and Literature at Exeter College under the tutorship of Jonathan Wordsworth, graduating in 1976. The second child in an academic family, his father Frederick S. Brooman was an author and economics lecturer at Bristol University, subsequently Professor of Economics at The Open University. Returning to Bristol after graduation from Oxford, Thomas took a path in music, firstly as a drummer during the heyday of punk music in the late 'seventies with several bands in Bristol, including The Media, The Spics and The Tesco Chainstore Massacre. In 1980, with a group of friends, he established a record magazine publication called The Bristol Recorder, and through this project made contact with the English artist Peter Gabriel with whom the concept of WOMAD was born. WOMAD Festival In early 1981, with Peter Gabriel and a group of colleagues, including Martin Elbourne, chef Jonathan Arthur, Stephen Pritchard and Bob Hooton, Thomas devised and organised the first WOMAD Festival in 1982. Over the following twenty six years he then worked as Festival and Artistic Director of the WOMAD Festival, leading the establishment of WOMAD as an organisation and its affiliated charity, the WOMAD Foundation, in 1983. WOMAD Festivals helped to establish a wider audience for many international artists and contributed to the identification of world music as a description of music from a global context. As Artistic Director of WOMAD, through until 2008, he programmed and collaborated in the production of more than one hundred and forty five WOMAD Festivals and events in twenty-four countries and islands; in Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe and North America. Other activities In 1987 he co- founded Real World Records, a label conceived as a creative partnership between Peter Gabriel and the WOMAD organisation. In 2000 Thomas also ventured into the world of pub ownership with the purchase of Bristol's historic Palace Hotel in Old Market. Built in 1869, The Palace is a landmark Bristol City centre building and famous for its sloping bar floor and elaborate Victorian columns and ornamentation. At the time of its purchase in 2000, the whole building was in need of total refurbishment and Thomas undertook the project with the help of a small but dedicated team. The Palace opened its doors to the public again in October 2000 and built a loyal following for its music- centred atmosphere featuring weekly gigs and a Saturday night DJ residency featuring Bristol's legendary DJ Derek. Since 2008 he has worked as a music advisor with Dartington Hall and Creative Youth Network in Bristol and as a music mentor with South West Music School. Thomas also now works as freelance Music Programmer for Salisbury Arts Centre. Described by the BBC as having an 'open-minded, music-first, approach' he has worked on collaborative and creative projects with many artists from all over the world, including Bill Cobham and Asere, Madosini and Patrick Duff, David D'Or, Totó La Momposina, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Terem Quartet and Trilok Gurtu. He has also been extensively involved in record compilation and production work. Awards and honours Described by The Times newspaper as a 'visionary artistic director' Thomas was also recognised in 2005 by the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) as recipient of the first World Shaker Award in the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music. In 2008 he was made a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for his life services to music and charity.

He was particularly known for collaborative paintings in which he painted flower garlands around religious scenes or portraits painted by a specialist figure painter.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1134 Andries Bosman at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Only very little is known about the life and artistic training of Andries Bosman. He was baptized in Antwerp's St George Church on 28 July 1621. He was registered as an apprentice at the Guild of St. Luke in Antwerp in 1637. It was not recorded who his teacher was. It is assumed that he studied with the Jesuit priest and prominent flower painter Daniel Seghers. Bosman studied theology. After completing this study with success, painting always remained secondary to this career as a priest. He became chaplain to the art-loving Bishop Anthonius Triest in Ghent in 1641. In 1657 Bosman returned to Antwerp where he had been appointed canon in the St. James' Church in Antwerp. In 1664 he renounced his prebend and left for Italy. It is reported that during his residence in Italy he participated in painting commissions. He stayed mainly in Rome, where in 1676 he collaborated with Niccolò Stanchi in the decoration of the Palazzo Borghese gallery by adding flowers to mirrors. He also collaborated with the Italian painter Ciro Ferri.Andries Bosmans at the Prado Museum website Bosman is believed to have died between 1671 and 1692. Work Only a few works by Bosman are recorded. He was a close follower of his presumed master Daniel Seghers. A study comparing the painting techniques used by both artists in two paintings disclosed the similarity in their techniques and the materials they used.Anne Haack Christensen, Erma Hermens, Hannah Tempest,, A Master and his Pupil: the painting techniques of Daniël Seghers and Andries Bosman Cartouche with the Christ Child surrounded by a flower garland Some of Bosman's works have been confounded with those of Seghers because of the signature \\"DS\\" on some works of Bosman. This was, however, not intended as a reference to Daniel Seghers, but to his membership in the Society of Jesus. A majority of Bosman's work falls into a distinctively Flemish genre, which is referred to as 'garland painting'. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in early 17th century Antwerp by Daniel Seghers' master Jan Brueghel the Elder at the instigation of the Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150. Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included Hendrick van Balen, Andries Daniels, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers himself. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement. It was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image, portrait or other religious symbol (such as the host). Garland paintings were typically collaborations between a still life specialist and a figure painter. Bosman collaborated on garland paintings for which he painted the flower garlands. It is not known who were the figure painters who added the figures in the central cartouche of these paintings. A garland painted referred to as Garland around St Anna, the Virgin and the Child signed as having been painted in Brussels is a copy of a work by Seghers of the same subject in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. The National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen holds a garland painting entitled Cartouche with the Christ Child surrounded by a flower garland, which is signed \\"A.Bosman Canon St. Jacobi f. 1659 \\". Even while Bosman followed Seghers' style closely, there are stylistic differences between the two painters' work. Bosman's colors are clearer than Seghers'. Bosman pays less attention to a meticulous representation of the details of his subjects, while he treats the effects and contrasts of light on objects and space less gently.

Built in the late 1850s to a design by Ammi B. Young, it is the only known surviving Marine Hospital (a federal facility for treating seamen) of the period to retain original iron railings. The building is now part of the Portland campus of the Martin's Point Health Care medical practice. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The former Marine Hospital building occupies a prominent hilltop on Martin's Point, a peninsular projection in eastern Portland that marks the southern side of the mouth of the Presumpscot River at Casco Bay. The larger and lower modern Martin's Point Health Care building stands to the southeast, with the main entrance rotary to the building's northeast. The Marine Hospital is a three-story structure, built with load-bearing brick walls and granite trim. It has a roughly H-shaped plan, with granite quoining at the corners, and a multi-stage projecting cornice that includes a band of bracketing. Windows are typically sash, set in rectangular openings with granite lintels and sills. The southwest facade is nine bays wide, with the central five bays taken up by a stack of balconies, which have cast iron railings that are original to the building's construction. The porches are topped by a projecting roof section that continues the elaborate cornice. The hospital was built in 1855-59 by the federal government, as part of the Marine Hospital Service, which provided medical care to sick and disabled seamen. The building was designed by Ammi B. Young, then the supervising architect of the United States Treasury Department. Young was responsible for designing a significant number of federal buildings in this role, including several marine hospitals; this building is the only one of those buildings to survive with its ironwork (one of Young's signature features) relatively intact. The Marine Hospital Service was created by Congress in 1798, and there was an active service in Portland, Maine's largest port, by 1805. This hospital was built on the site of the Veranda Hotel, which burned in 1847. It served as a hospital until 1952, and in 1956 it became a Marine Corps Reserve Training Center. Before becoming part of Martin's Point Health Care, it was also used as an outpatient clinic of the United States Public Health Service.

The route runs primarily along Utica Avenue north from the Kings Plaza shopping center through Eastern Brooklyn, with continued service west along Broadway to the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza Bus Terminal. The corridor was originally served by a streetcar line, known as the Utica and Reid Avenues Line, Utica−Reid Line, Reid−Utica Line, Reid Avenue Line, or Utica Avenue Line until 1951, when the line was replaced by bus service. The bus route is operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations under the New York City Transit brand. The B46 consistently ranks among the top five busiest routes in New York City, and is the busiest in Brooklyn, serving 13 million riders in 2017. Because of this, in 2009 the route was selected for conversion into bus rapid transit under Phase II of the city's Select Bus Service (SBS) program, implemented on July 3, 2016. The B46 was also notorious for high incidence of crime and fare evasion; in 2014, the magazine The New Yorker declared the route \\"the most dangerous bus route in the city\\", following several crimes such as the killing of a B46 bus driver in 2008. Route description and service The northern terminal of the bus route, and the former terminal of the streetcar line, the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza Bus Terminal. =Streetcar route= The Utica−Reid streetcar line began at Avenue N and Utica Avenue in Flatlands, just north of the Flatbush Trolley Depot. It ran north along Utica Avenue to the street's terminus at Fulton Street. It then ran north along Reid Avenue to Broadway, and west along Broadway to the Washington Plaza trolley terminal at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge. The trackage along Broadway was shared with the Broadway Line. The line had previously continued over the Williamsburg Bridge between 1904 and 1923 and during the 1930s, using the southernmost trolley tracks, to the Essex Street terminal in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. =Current bus service= The current B46 route begins at the bus terminal of the Kings Plaza shopping center at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, on the border of the Mill Basin and Marine Park neighborhoods. After running a short distance on Flatbush Avenue, it turns north onto Utica Avenue, following the trolley route along Utica Avenue, the former Reid Avenue (renamed Malcolm X Boulevard in 1985), and Broadway (underneath the BMT Jamaica Line). The segment on Broadway is shared with the B47. The route terminates at the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza Bus Terminal, which replaced the trolley terminal. During most hours of the day, seven days a week, the B46 employs limited-stop service along Malcolm X Boulevard, Utica Avenue, and Flatbush Avenue between DeKalb Avenue and Malcolm X Boulevard (near the Kosciuszko Street station of the BMT Jamaica Line), and Kings Plaza, via the B46 Select Bus Service route. The B46 SBS operates between DeKalb Avenue and Kings Plaza only, while the B46 local continues to Williamsburg, making all stops along Broadway. Avenue H, and the Crown Heights – Utica Avenue station at Eastern Parkway serve as short turn terminals for B46 local service, while some B46 SBS buses begin or end service at Avenue N, just north of the Flatbush Bus Depot. The B46 SBS does not operate during early morning and late night hours; during this time, the B46 local covers the entire route between Williamsburg and Kings Plaza.See: * * Prior to SBS implementation in 2016, the service pattern was reversed, in which B46 limited-stop buses would continue to Williamsburg, while B46 local buses terminated at DeKalb Avenue or Eastern Parkway at their northern end, with many buses from both services terminating at Avenue H at their southern end. The B46 operates out of the Flatbush Bus Depot, which replaced the trolley depot, near Kings Plaza. Fare evasion and safety issues The B46 has been known for various safety issues, including assaults on and harassment of bus drivers and passengers, correlated with high rates of fare evasion (passengers not paying or refusing to pay a fare). The route runs through several high-crime neighborhoods, including Flatlands, East Flatbush, Crown Heights, and Bedford–Stuyvesant. In 2008, it was estimated that there were 4,000 weekly incidents of fare evasion on the B46. The route was also among 10 services that constituted 22% of fare evasion in the city. In 2014, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) ranked the B46 route as the \\"most dangerous and crime-ridden bus route\\" in terms of fare evasion and on- bus assaults; in the previous year, there were 41 incidents in which drivers of B46 buses were assaulted or harassed. Select Bus Service stopsHistory= Streetcars = The Reid Avenue Line was originally a horse trolley line operated by the Broadway Railroad, running between Broadway Ferry in Williamsburg and Atlantic Avenue just south of Fulton Street. In 1893, the Broadway Railroad was purchased by the Long Island Traction Company, and the line began operations under the subsidiary Brooklyn, Queens County and Suburban Railroad in November of that year. The line was electrified on December 9, 1894. On July 1, 1898, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) acquired the route. In May 1900, the Reid Avenue Line was extended south along Utica Avenue to the neighborhood of Rugby (now East Flatbush), in conjunction with housing construction in the neighborhood. During the summer months of 1900, the line terminated at the Holy Cross Cemetery, west of Utica Avenue and south of Church Avenue. On October 15, the line was truncated to Utica Avenue and Church Avenue. Trolley service continued along the Church Avenue Line and Culver Line to Coney Island. After the Williamsburg Bridge opened in 1903, Reid Avenue trolleys began running across the south side of the bridge to Manhattan on November 6, 1904. The line used the trolley terminal at Essex Street at the Manhattan foot of the bridge.See: * * On June 1, 1910, the Utica Avenue Line was inaugurated as a shuttle between Church Avenue and Avenue N, connecting with the Flatbush Avenue Line to Bergen Beach. An additional fare was charged for transfer to the Reid Avenue Line. At the time, the town of Flatlands was largely rural farms, and most passengers on the shuttle line were beachgoers. On December 1, 1923, service on the Reid Avenue Line and all other now-Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) lines over the Williamsburg Bridge ended, due to decreasing profits and a dispute with the city over tolls. Reid Avenue service was truncated to Washington Plaza, and bridge service was replaced with municipal shuttle service.See: * * On February 15, 1931, Reid Avenue cars once again began running to Manhattan after municipal shuttle service ended. On July 1, 1937, the Reid and Utica lines were combined into a single-fare service called the \\"Utica−Reid Line\\". = Bus replacement = A B46 Limited bus in 2009, prior to SBS implementation Around this time, many streetcar lines in Brooklyn and the rest of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of the city's three primary transit companies (including the BMT) under municipal operations in June 1940. By 1949, the Utica line was one of eleven remaining streetcar routes in Brooklyn. On January 11, 1951, the New York City Board of Estimate voted unanimously to motorize nearly all the remaining trolley lines in the city, including the Utica−Reid Line. On March 18, 1951, the Utica−Reid Line was replaced by bus service, designated \\"B-46\\". Kings Plaza was opened in September 1970, and the B46 was extended south to the new mall around that time. In the 1980s during summer months, the B46 as well as the were extended south of Kings Plaza across the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge to the Rockaway peninsula in Queens to serve Jacob Riis Park, with a federal subsidy funding the extension. By 1994, service had decreased by 21% since the late 1980s due to competition from unlicensed van services. As enforcement against such vans was increased in summer 1993, ridership increased by 20%. An aggressive marketing program and the implementation of limited-stop service on the B46 were put into place to better compete with the vans. Limited-stop service was expected to save 6–8 minutes per trip. Limited-stop service was funded as part of the 1994 Fare Deal/Ridership Growth Initiative. To further take back ridership, the Fare Demonstration Program was introduced to the route, making the round trip bus fare $1.50 instead of $2.50, and the round trip intermodal fare $4 instead of $5. Northbound and southbound riders boarding prior to the stop at Eastern Parkway would receive a return ticket for their return trip from the subway stop. Limited-stop service, began on September 12, 1994, running between 6 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.. Limited-stop service made all stops north of DeKalb Avenue and south of Avenue H. * Saturday limited-stop service was added on September 10, 1995,The New York Times, Coming Transit Reductions: What They Mean for You, August 20, 1995, section 13, page 10 operating between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. On December 1, 2008, bus driver Edwin Thomas, who was operating a B46 Limited bus that day, was fatally stabbed by a passenger who did not pay his fare and, as a result, was refused a transfer. It was the first time a New York City bus operator had been killed on the job since an incident on the in 1981, where another bus driver was fatally shot, also because the driver had refused to give the passenger a transfer. The incident led to the strict enforcement of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) policy not to confront fare evaders, and installation of Plexiglas partitions on many city buses to protect bus operators; previously drivers were only protected by a single metal bar. The pilot program for the bus partitions began at the Flatbush Depot, where the B46 is dispatched from, in 2009. The same year as Thomas's stabbing, the MTA and New York City Police Department (NYPD) began deploying teams of police officers as well as squads of uniformed and plainclothes transit security officials (called EAGLE teams) on the B46 and other target routes to crack down on fare evaders, in the spirit of the broken windows theory. On February 26, 2014, an NYPD officer was shot in the legs by a fare evader after pulling him off a B46 bus. =Select Bus Service= In 2004, the Malcolm X Boulevard-Utica Avenue corridor was one of eight Brooklyn bus corridors studied under the city's bus rapid transit (BRT) study. In 2009, the B46 was included in a list of potential routes for the second phase of Select Bus Service (SBS), the city's brand of BRT service. The B46 was identified due to high ridership, isolation from subway service, and slow travel speeds caused by traffic congestion. Under the plan, the then-current local/limited service pattern would be reversed. The B46 Limited would become the B46 SBS, running between Kings Plaza and DeKalb Avenue only. The B46 Local would cover the Broadway portion of the route at all times, due to lower ridership on this section of the line. Limited-stop service would be instituted on the southern portion of the line between Kings Plaza and Avenue H, with local buses covering the stops on this portion of the route. Unlike most other SBS services, the service uses standard-length buses instead of articulated buses. Preliminary studies and community outreach began in 2011, with around 25 community meetings taking place. In 2014, the first dedicated bus lanes were installed on Utica Avenue between St. Johns Place and Church Avenue, offset from the sidewalk curb. In May 2015, the MTA and the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) announced plans to implement the B46 SBS in the fall of that year. In the summer of that year, the bus lanes were extended south to Fillmore Avenue. The implementation was pushed back, however, with two other SBS routes (the ) going into service during this time. The B46 Select Bus Service was later announced to begin in spring 2016, then to summer 2016, finally beginning service on July 3, 2016. Initially, the B46 SBS ran with shorter buses, unlike most other Select Bus Service routes, which used longer articulated buses. In late 2019, the MTA indicated that it would start using articulated buses on the route by January 2020 to increase passenger capacity.

Its first formation was formed during the Russian Civil War and fought in the Perekop-Chongar Offensive in 1920. It also fought in the Soviet invasion of Poland, Winter War and World War II. During World War II, it fought in the Battle of Rostov, Barvinkove-Losowaja Operation and Second Battle of Kharkov before being destroyed at the Battle of Voronezh. Officially disbanded on 28 November 1942, the division was reformed on 15 April 1943 from the 15th Rifle Brigade. The 2nd formation fought in Operation Bagration and the Battle of Königsberg. It appears to have been disbanded in 1946.  History = First formation = On 6 July 1919, 3rd Army commander Sergey Mezheninov issued Order No. 158, forming the 51st Rifle Division, part of the Northern Expeditionary Unit. The formation took place in Tyumen, where the 151st, 152nd and 153rd Brigades were formed. The organization of the division was completed by 15 August, when division commander Vasily Blyukher issued his first order, defining the divisional structure. The division included headquarters, the political department, logistics and other services, three brigades of three infantry regiments each (numbered from 450th to 458th), communications and engineering battalions, and armored car detachments. Blyukher himself arrived in Tyumen on 19 August and established his headquarters in the house of the merchant Kolokolnikov. During the final phase of the Petropavlovsk Operation in the fall of 1919, the 151st Brigade advanced on Ishim. The 152nd Brigade moved to Tobolsk, and the 153rd Brigade was held in reserve in Tyumen. At the end of November, it became part of the 5th Army. After the defeat of the White Army led by Alexander Kolchak, the division was relocated to Novonikolayevsk. The division became part of the high command of the Red Army's reserve on 1 January 1920. The division was tasked with the repair of the Siberian railway and the Cheremhovsky coal mines, destroyed during the Russian Civil War. On 4 July, the division received orders to transfer to the Southern Front to fight against White Army units led by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel. The advance echelons of the division arrived at Apostolove station in early August. On 3 August, the division was included in the group of forces on the right bank of the Dnieper and concentrated near Berislavlya. The 13th Army command began an offensive on 6 August to smash the White Army units between the Dnieper and the Crimean Isthmus. The main attack was assigned to the 52nd Rifle Division and Latvian Rifle Division. The 51st Rifle Division was placed in the second echelon of the attack without being given time to fully concentrate. On the night of 7 August, the 52nd and Latvian division crossed the Dnieper, captured Kakhovka and Alyosha, and began to advance on Melitopol. The 51st followed them across the Dnieper and began building defences in the area of Kakhovka. Meanwhile, the attack of the group of forces on the left bank of the Dnieper was repulsed from the beginning, allowing Wrangel to concentrate more forces against the 52nd and Latvian divisions. Both divisions were forced to retreat back to the Kakhovka bridgehead, now held by the 51st Rifle Division. White attempts to reach the Dnieper were repulsed by the 51st Rifle Division. Firmly entrenched in the bridgehead, the division routed opposing forces during 13th Army's second offensive on 21 August. On 27 August, the division reached the area of Serogozy. During battles in the Serogozy area on 28–29 August, the division reportedly inflicted heavy losses on the White units and conducted an orderly retreat back to the bridgehead. At the end of September, Southern Front was created under command of Mikhail Frunze. The group of forces on the right bank was disbanded and became 6th Army. The 51st Rifle Division was ordered to firmly defend the Kakhovka bridgehead from the planned White Army attack. British-made Mark IV tank used by White Army, captured 14 October 1920 in the Kakhovka bridgehead During October, the division constructed a defensive line in the bridgehead. The line had a length of 40 kilometers and a depth of 12 kilometers. Its antitank defences were based on field artillery and antitank ditches, as well as landmines. On 14 October, the White Army made a last desperate attack to capture the bridgehead and throw the 51st back across the Dnieper. Despite tank support, the White Army attack failed. In preparation for the final Red Army offensive, the division received reinforcements. The division's objective was to destroy the White 2nd Corps and capture the White fortifications on the Perekop Isthmus. The 51st, 15th and Latvian Rifle Divisions, a separate cavalry brigade, cavalry regiment and armored car detachment formed the Perekop Strike Group. The attack began on 28 October and the division had captured Perekop by the next day. The division renewed the attack on 30 October, but was unable to overrun the Turetsky Val and had to dig in. Blyukher had the advance units withdrawn from within range of White fire. On 30 October, Blyukher ordered the 151st Brigade to reconnoiter the Perekop Gulf for a possible crossing. He also ordered the 153rd Brigade to reconnoiter Syvash. On 1 November, Blyukher offered to allow the White Army units to surrender. On 7 November, the Perekop-Chongar Offensive was begun. The division attempted to storm the Turetsky Val but was unable to break through by the next day. During the night, elements of the division crossed Syvash and emerged in the White rear. With a simultaneous frontal attack, this assault captured the Turetsky Val. The 51st Rifle Division continued to advance and broke through the Yushunskaya positions with the aid of the Latvian Rifle Division. The capture of the Yushinskaya position ended organized White resistance in the Crimea.Mikhail Frunze presents divisional commander Pavel Dybenko with an honorary revolutionary red banner in Crimea in 1921 On 13 October, it became the 51st Moscow Rifle Division. On 14 September 1921, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. It became the 51st Perekop Red Banner on behalf of the Moscow Soviet of Workers, Peasants and Red Army Deputies Rifle Division. At the same time, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour of the Ukrainian SSR by the Central Election Commission. In December 1935, the division was awarded the Order of Lenin for the 15th anniversary of the fighting at Perekop. In September 1939, the 51st became part of the Ukrainian Front for the Soviet invasion of Poland, but did not see combat. The division fought in the Winter War as part of the 7th Army from January to April 1940. Five soldiers of the division were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for their actions during the war. In June 1940, the division participated in the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia as part of the 14th Rifle Corps.On 22 June 1941, the division was part of the 14th Rifle Corps of the 9th Army in the Odessa Military District. The division was based in the Danube Delta area. It fought against advancing German troops in Operation München. It retreated back to the Prut and then the Dniester near Dubăsari. The division then was forced to retreat back to the Southern Bug and the Dnieper at Kakhovka and Kherson. By November 1941, the division was in the Donbass. On 16 November, the division, now part of the 37th Army, attacked in the direction of Pavlovka and Taganrog. On 27 November, the division participated in the Battle of Rostov. The division did not break through until 29 November and advanced to Sultan-Saly. In January 1942, the division transferred to fight in the Barvenkovo-Lozovaya Operation and was on the Donets. In late July, the division was withdrawn on the Don and across the Manych. It was disbanded on 16 August and its personnel transferred to other units. = Second formation = The division was formed again on 12 July 1943 from the 15th Rifle Brigade. The division was relocated to Makhachkala and became part of the Baku Military District's 124th Rifle Corps in the winter of 194546. As part of the corps it was to land in northern Iran if necessary. The division and its corps were disbanded by May 1946.Feskov et al 2013, p. 525  Composition  The 51st Rifle Division's first formation included the following units during World War II. * 23rd Rifle Regiment * 287th Rifle Regiment * 348th Rifle Regiment * 263rd Rifle Regiment (from 12 July 1941, transferred from 25th Rifle Division) * 218th Artillery Regiment (until 25 January 1942) * 300th Artillery Regiment (from 25 January 1942) * 277th Separate Antitank Battalion * 231st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery (later 165th Separate Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion) * 774th Mortar Battalion * 30th Reconnaissance Battalion * 44th Sapper Battalion * 50th Separate Communications Battalion * 115th Medical Battalion * 60th Separate Chemical Defence Company * 57th Trucking Company * 60th (later 65th) Field Bakery * 159th (later 1495th) Field Post Office * 346th Field Ticket Office of the State Bank The 51st Rifle Division's second formation included the following units. * 23rd Rifle Regiment * 287th Rifle Regiment * 348th Rifle Regiment * 300th Rifle Regiment * 91st Separate Antitank Battalion * 30th Intelligence Company * 44th Sapper Battalion * 207th Separate Communications Battalion (later 653rd Separate Communications Company) * 115th Medical Battalion * 60th Separate Chemical Defence Company * 125th Trucking Company * 309th Field Bakery * 84th Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 1628th Field Post Office * 34th (later 1657th) Field Ticket Office of the State Bank  References Sources * * Category:Infantry divisions of the Soviet Union Category:Soviet infantry divisions in the Russian Civil War 051 Category:Military units and formations established in 1919 Category:Military units and formations of the Soviet Union in the Winter War Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1946 ","title":"51st Rifle Division (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"49177869","text":"Reichardt's dye (Betaine 30) is an organic dye belonging to the class of azomerocyanine betaines.

It was the home ground of Rangers from 1887 until they moved to the adjacent second Ibrox in 1899. The ground staged the Scottish Cup Final four times and also three Scotland international matches. History Rangers' previous ground at Kinning Park had been built up to hold 20,000 people, but further expansion was impossible and so the club identified a site further west to build a new ground. Although the site at Ibrox (at that time part of the burgh of Govan, today part of Glasgow) was then on the outskirts of the city, it had good transport links, including the nearby Ibrox railway station. A ten-year lease on the site was secured and a ground constructed by Fred Braby & Co. An uncovered 1,200-seat stand was erected on the northern side of the pitch with an adjacent pavilion. The other three sides were terraced, with a running track around the pitch. The ground was opened on 20 August 1887 with a friendly match against Preston North End.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p188 A new grandstand was built on the southern side of the pitch, after which the ground was used to host three Scotland internationals; an 1889 British Home Championship match against Ireland (7–0 to Scotland), an 1892 British Home Championship match against England (1–4) and an 1897 British Home Championship match against Ireland (5–1).Scotland - International Matches 1881–1890 RSSSFScotland - International Matches 1891–1900 RSSSF It was also used to host the 1890 Scottish Cup final, and the replay, between Queen's Park and Vale of Leven. Rangers were playing at the ground when they joined the new Scottish Football League for the 1890–91 season, with the first league match played at the ground on 18 August 1890, a 5–2 win against Hearts in front of a crowd of 4,000. The ground was chosen to host the 1892 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Queen's Park, but proved inadequate for the estimated 30,000 attendance. There were further problems when Ibrox hosted the international against England three weeks later; a stand collapsed, causing two deaths. The 1893 Cup Final, again between Celtic and Queen's Park, was also staged at Ibrox, but again there were problems; the match was declared void due to poor pitch conditions and had to be played again. The ground hosted the Cup Final for the fourth and last time when St Bernard's played Renton in 1895. With the new Celtic Park, opened in 1892, becoming established as Glasgow's leading football venue, Rangers subsequently decided to take out a lease on a new site adjacent to Ibrox Park and build a new stadium from scratch, which opened in December 1899. The second Ibrox Park (now Ibrox Stadium) was built west of and partially overlapping the site of its predecessor, which backed directly onto Copland Road; the eastern end of the site was used for housing. The club's final league match at the original Ibrox Park was played on 9 December 1899, a 6–1 win over Kilmarnock with 5,000 in attendance. However, the new Ibrox was not ready in time for the next match against St Mirren on 16 December, which was instead played at Partick Thistle's Meadowside.

He became a monk in France before coming to England to serve as King Edward the Confessor's doctor. He served as a prior before becoming abbot of Bury St Edmunds in 1065. As abbot he promoted the cult of Edmund the Martyr and secured the abbey's independence from the bishops of Thetford. He continued to serve as royal physician to two more kings of England and also rebuilt parts of the abbey. Early life Baldwin was born at Chartres, and was educated as a physician in Alsace. He became a monk at St Denis Abbey in France.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 32 It is unknown when Baldwin became King Edward the Confessor's doctor. The historian Frank Barlow argues that he must have served the king for some time before being rewarded with the office of abbot.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 82 and footnote 3 He became prior of Deerhurst Priory before becoming abbot, but the exact date is unknown.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 102 He was also prior of a monastery at Leberaw (now in Alsace, France). Abbot Baldwin was appointed as abbot of Bury St Edmunds in 1065, on 19 August. Baldwin appears to have been the only non-English abbot appointed by Edward during his reign.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 191 and footnote 5 Baldwin appears as a witness on two forged charters dated to Christmas 1065. The witness lists for these two charters may be genuine, having been copied from a legitimate document to lend authenticity to the forgeries. If genuine, they would show that Baldwin was at Edward's last court during his last illness.Rex Harold II pp. 195–196 After the death of Edward and the succession of King Harold Godwinson in early 1066, Baldwin provided soldiers to support Harold in his defence against other claimants to the English throne.Walker Harold p. 119 After the Conquest After the Norman Conquest in 1066, Baldwin received a confirmation of the abbey's title to all their lands;Rex English Resistance p. 45 however the new king, William the Conqueror, ordered Baldwin to surrender to him any lands held by men who had fought against him and who had died in that resistance.Rex English Resistance p. 70 Baldwin continued to serve as a royal doctor to William. He also defended East Anglia against Danish incursions after the Conquest, as well as against general disorder there from after-effects of the Conquest.Rex English Resistance pp. 194–195 In 1071 Baldwin secured from Pope Alexander II the right to have any bishop of the abbey's choice perform episcopal functions for the abbey, rather than the more usual method of having the diocesan bishop perform these functions. This effectively made the abbey free of supervision by the bishops of Thetford. This privilege was challenged in 1081 but upheld by the king.Mason William II pp. 129–130 Baldwin also served as King William II's doctor.Barlow William Rufus p. 113 In 1094 Baldwin oversaw the completion of the rebuilding of the choir of the monastic church. He asked the king for permission to dedicate the new building and translate the relics of Edmund the Martyr into the new choir. The king at first agreed, then changed his mind and said in December 1094 that while the translation could proceed, the consecration should not. But the king appears to have changed his mind again in early 1095, and on Sunday 29 April 1095 both the translation and the consecration took place. Besides Edmund's relics, the remains of two other saints – Botulf and Firmin – were also translated in a ceremony overseen by Walkelin, the Bishop of Winchester. The sermon that Walkelin preached was twice interrupted – once by a miraculous cure of a knight injured by the large crowd, and second by a large rainstorm that came, according to witnesses, in response to prayers to Saint Edmund to end a drought.Barlow William Rufus pp. 207–208 The bishop of Thetford, Herbert Losinga, protested against this usurpation of his normal right to consecrate the church, but his protests were countered by the papal privilege of 1071 and the royal confirmation of that papal document. Death and legacy Baldwin died around Christmas 1097, with Florence of Worcester giving the date as 29 December. However, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in version E gives his death year as 1098. Baldwin may have been the indirect source of King William II's favourite oath, \\"By the Face of Lucca\\", as Baldwin visited the cathedral of St Martin in Lucca on a visit to Rome. Baldwin later gave some relics of St Edmund to the cathedral, leading the cathedral's canons to promote the cult of Edmund there. The Holy Face of Lucca was a relic held by the cathedral at Lucca, and Baldwin may have described the relic to the king, leading him to adopt the oath. Baldwin was active in promoting the cult of Edmund in other ways. He claimed that any who attacked the abbey would be struck with headaches, and supposedly one man was driven mad from the headaches after attacking the monastery.

Overview  The main purpose of SNAMP is to simplify management of microservices running inside of containers or software-defined data centers. It provides telemetry data gathering (metrics and events), end-to-end tracing of requests between software components reflecting topology of communication paths, automatic scaling of cluster nodes based on workload, unification of telemetry data sources. = Telemetry = Metrics, events and health checks are used to control state and health of services in IT landscape. Gathering is carried out in real time. The collected data can be used for visualization in the form of charts, alarming and executing maintenance actions. It is possible to set up a watcher for the important metric. The watcher determines limitations and conditions applied to the value of the metric. If the value is out of range then watcher can execute a trigger. The trigger can be represented as handwritten script using one of the supported scripting languages, e.g. Groovy. It can be a maintenance action (restart server node) or notification (alert to e-mail). Additionally, it is possible to extend functionality of existing monitoring tool used in enterprise. SNAMP can gather telemetry data and expose the data to the outside using any combination of supported protocols. For example, the data collected from JMX protocol can be exposed through SNMP and acquired by other network management software such as Nagios. = Tracing of requests = Tracing of requests allows to identify communication paths between services and to collect important metrics such as response time, requests per second, availability, scalability etc. This data helps to troubleshoot latency and scalability issues and to find the bottlenecks. Additionally, communication paths can be visualized in the form of the graph in the Web Console that allows to observe entire IT landscape in real time. Applications should be instrumented to report the necessary information to SNAMP. Instrumentation libraries can be found at Maven Central using groupID \`io.snamp.instrumentation\`. Third-party instrumentation libraries are also supported: * OpenZipkin * Apache HTrace = Elasticity management = Elasticity manager is a component of SNAMP that is responsible for automatic provisioning and decommissioning of cluster nodes. Its behavior is based on scaling policies. One more scaling policies can be associated with the cluster. Decision process is based on fuzzy logic. Each policy participating has its own vote weight and elasticity manager execute voting process periodically. Voting result represents one out of three possible decisions: enlarge cluster, shrink cluster or do nothing. Scaling policy can be based on health check, handwritten script or range of values associated with some metric. Due to the flexibility of the decision process it is possible to define several strategies for scaling: * All-of strategy means that all scaling policies should vote for changing the capacity of the cluster * Any-of strategy means that at least one of the scaling policies can vote for changing the capacity of the cluster * Majority strategy means that majority of scaling policies can vote for changing the capacity of the cluster Moreover, it is also possible to assign custom weights for each scaling policy. Elasticity manager uses underlying cluster or cloud management platform for sending commands about provisioning and decommissioning. It can be OpenStack, Kubernetes or VMware ESXi. = Web Console = Web Console is used for visualization of metrics in the form of charts, visualization of communication paths between services in the form of graph, cluster monitor. Using Web Console for visualization is an optional feature, because SNAMP provides integration with other tools such as Grafana.  Architecture  SNAMP platform consists of following several components: * Resource Connector responsible for communication between SNAMP and service in IT landscape. It encapsulates communication protocol and exposes telemetry data to SNAMP in unified way. For example, JMX Connector can be used to control Java applications using JMX protocol. * Gateway exposes information collected from all resource connectors to the outside using the selected specified protocol. For example, SNMP Gateway can expose telemetry data obtained from all resource connectors using SNMP protocol. * Supervisor controls group of resources. It provides health monitor, elasticity management, automatic discovery of resources. Combination of different gateways and resource connectors is able to transform telemetry data from one protocol to another. Each component might be customized using Groovy-based scripts. It is possible to write custom component using any JVM-compatible languages.  Features  * Integration with third-party visualization and monitoring tools: Grafana, Nagios, SSH * Collecting telemetry data using following protocols and technologies: Spring Actuator, OpenZipkin spans (from Kafka and HTTP), HTTP, JMX, Modbus, rsh, stdout from command-line tools, SSH * Exposing telemetry data using following protocols: XMPP (chat bot), SNMPv2/SNMPv3, HTTP, NRDP, NSCA, syslog, data streaming to InfluxDB * Elasticity management supports OpenStack Senlin. * Groovy scripting  Alternatives  An alternative solution might be constructed using combination of software components: * Monitoring and visualization: Nagios, Grafana * End-to-end tracing: OpenZipkin * Automatic scaling: AWS provides automatic scaling of EC2 resources, OpenStack Heat Jolokia offers JMX-to-HTTP bridge that can be hosted inside of a standalone Java program, Java EE application server or OSGi environment.

The protests gained momentum in September, when up to 100,000 people demonstrated in the largest protest since Moldova's independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. The protests have been organised by a grass-roots citizens' movement, Dignity and Truth (), that was established in February 2015 as a response to the disappearance of $1 billion from the Moldovan banks in 2014. Dignity and Truth is led by lawyers, journalists and other well-known figures in Moldova. Background In Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, nearly 17% of the population live below the poverty line. Moreover, with an average wage of about $129 per month, Moldova reportedly has the lowest standard of living in Europe. In 2014, $1 billion vanished from three of Moldova's leading banks.The great Moldovan bank robbery, BBC News (18 June 2015) In two days loans worth $1 billion were transferred in to United Kingdom and Hong Kong-registered companies whose ultimate owners are unknown.The billion-dollar ex-council flat, BBC News (7 October 2015) Banks are administered by the National Bank of Moldova, so this loss was covered from state reserves. This protected depositors but created a hole in Moldovan public finances equivalent to an eighth of the country's GDP. Protesters claim this damaged their living standards.Thousands join Moldova anti-government protest, BBC News (13 September 2015) The issue highlighted the problem of corruption in Moldova and although the government has promised an investigation, protest leaders have called for a campaign of civil disobedience, a general strike and a refusal to pay utility bills in order to force the resignation of the government. Likewise, as a response to the $1 billion disappearance the grass-roots citizens' movement Dignity and Truth () was established in February 2015. This organization is led by lawyers, journalists and other well-known figures in Moldova. Unification with Romania is seen as a solution to Moldova's economic, political and social crisis, but also in the context of the tensions in neighbouring Ukraine. Polls up to May 2015 showed 10 to 20 percent of Moldovans supported unification. =Name= The protests are dubbed in the international press as the Moldovan Maidan (due to similar circumstances with Ukrainian Euromaidan) and Anti-oligarchic movement. In Moldova, media outlets cataloged the events as a Red Revolution, due to involvement of communist and socialist parties in the protests. =Protesters' profile= The protesters have formed two distinct camps: pro-European sympathizers and those who support pro-Russian parties. But while they may be separated by aspirations and ideologies, both sides have similar aims: the resignation of the government, the conviction of corrupt oligarchs and early elections. For those in the pro-Russian camp, the corruption cases have provoked a crisis of confidence in the European project. Moldova signed an association agreement with the European Union in 2013, committing to core reforms, economic recovery, sector cooperation and justice, but anti-European sentiment is growing. An April 2015 poll found that 32% of Moldovans favoured joining the EU, a decrease of 46 percent compared to 78% in 2007.  Timeline = Farmers' protests = The National Farmers Federation of Moldova, the Republican Association UniAgroProtect, the National Farmers Federation AGROinform and the Association Moldova-Fruct organized on 27 March and 15 April protest action by farmers throughout the country. According to organizers, the protests mobilized more than 5,000 farmers. They blocked national roads with agricultural machinery. Farmers oppose a VAT increase from 8% to 20% and demand swift access to a credit line of nearly €100 million offered by Poland with a subsidized interest rate. Farmers say that, because of the devaluation of the leu, resulting from de facto nationalization of the banks at the heart of the economic crisis, they can't service outstanding loans. They had several meetings with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Finance, but were not satisfied with the result. The farmers' demands include replenishment of subsidy funds in 2015 to 1.2 billion lei, the release of the lending process in agriculture and the decrease of the lending interest rate. = 5 April demonstration = Protest of DA Platform in Chișinău, on 5 April Tens of thousands of people across the country gathered in downtown Chișinău, at the call of the Dignity and Truth Platform, in an action of protest against the collapse of the financial and banking system, but also against judicial corruption. Demonstrators chanted slogans against the government led by Chiril Gaburici and demanded the unification of Romania and Moldova. Gaburici resigned on 22 June after an investigation into alleged fraud in his educational qualifications and was replaced permanently by Valeriu Streleț on 30 July. = 3 May demonstration = On 3 May, up to 50,000 people protested against the Government of Moldova, saying it had failed to implement reforms to bring the country closer to the European Union. Protesters also called on the government to investigate the disappearance of $1 billion (nearly 1/8 of the country's GDP) from the state- owned Savings Bank and the private banks Unibank, Banca de Economii and Banca Socială, in November 2014 before parliamentary elections. The central bank commissioned risk consultancy Kroll to conduct a preliminary investigation into the activities of the three stricken banks. Their findings were confidential but on 4 May parliament speaker Andrian Candu published what he said was Kroll's report on his website. \\"There appears to have been a deliberate plan to gain control of each of the banks and subsequently manipulate transactions to gain access to credit, whilst giving the appearance to the contrary\\", the report said. The protest activities were mobilized by the newly founded citizen platform called \\"Dignity and Truth\\" – allegedly financed by Viorel and Victor Topa, two exiled businessmen – to which leading personalities in Moldovan civil society belong. = Expulsion of George Simion = A protest took place on 14 May, in Bucharest, in front of the Embassy of the Republic of Moldova, calling for an \\"urgent revocation of abusive measures\\" taken by the Chișinău authorities against Romanian citizen George Simion. The measure was seen as an attempt to intimidate the protest announced for 16 May. Simion had come to Moldova to help organize and take part in the march. He was expelled for five years on 14 May on grounds that his activities could endanger national security.Thousands Rally In Moldova For Unification With Romania, Radio Free Europe (15 May 2015) Despite this, more than 25,000 people gathered in Grand National Assembly Square in the largest pro-Romanian manifestation in Chișinău in recent years. Most of the protesters were young people and intellectuals. They demanded the unification of Romania and Moldova and displayed placards with unionist and anti-Russian messages. Demonstrators were joined, among others, by Mayor of Chișinău Dorin Chirtoacă. Column of protesters made several stops in front of the embassies of Romania, Germany, the United States and Russia. Participants at the unionist march voted for the formation of the National Unity Bloc (), adjoining 22 non-governmental entities, including: Civic Movement Youth of Moldova, Unionist Platform Action 2012, Association Light of Transnistrian Teachers, Queen Helen Foundation, Children Charity Foundation Sidereal Moment, Association of Former Deportees in USSR, Association Tiras-Bender, etc. The march ended with the signing of a Pact of Union, Pact for Europe. A bus with 50 members of the Moldovan Youth organization and others who wanted to attend the rally were blocked and legitimated by police in Cahul. Meanwhile, about 40 high school students from Florești were warned by telephone, through parents, by the police that if they participate in demonstrations on 16 May, they would suffer as during the protests of 7 April 2009. Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta conducted a visit to Chișinău on the occasion of Moldovan Independence Day, being greeted by about 200 young men with masks featuring George Simion. \\"We want to see justice done in the case of George Simion, we want functional justice and we believe that true sovereignty, independence and freedom can only be achieved through union\\", stated Anatol Ursu, one of the organizers of the flash mob. After pressure from civil society and Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu, Chișinău Court of Appeal decided, on 18 September, to lift the ban imposed on George Simion. On 22 September, Romanian and Moldovan governments met in joint session, in Neptun. At the same time, over 300 people gathered outside the building where the meeting was held, demanding unification of Moldova with Romania. Before the meeting began, protesters tried to force the cordon of gendarmes to get closer to the building, and some of them jostled with law enforcers. The heads of the two governments agreed to talk to the unionists. = March of Stephen the Great = Unified Romania, including Transnistria, as envisaged by unionists On 5 July 2015, up to 30,000 people, according to organizers, gathered in Grand National Assembly Square, Chișinău, facing Government House and the Monument to the Victims of the Soviet Occupation, to demand the unification of Romania and Moldova. Participants chanted unionist slogans and voted symbolically for a union. Organized by Unionist Platform \\"Action 2012\\" and Youth of Moldova, the manifestation was claimed to be one of the largest in the recent history of Moldova and the fourth great national gathering after those of 27 August 1989 (calling for a restoration of the Latin script), 16 December 1990 (in support of changing the name of the state to Republic of Moldova) and 27 August 1991 (celebrating the proclamation of independence from the USSR). Among participants were present Members of the Romanian Parliament and Moldovans from the Diaspora. Thousands of young people among the participants in the Great National Gathering headed to Bucharest in the March of Stephen the Great () calling for the unification of Moldova with Romania. The march lasted a week, from 5 to 11 July. In the Republic of Moldova, the march followed the route Strășeni–Lozova–Călărași–Cornești–Ungheni. Participants crossed the Prut River, on 11 July, at 10 a.m., in a large-scale reenactment of the Bridges of Flowers in 1990. Their march ended in Bucharest, where were greeted by several hundred Romanian citizens in University Square, before making their way to the Cotroceni Palace to call on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to support the unification project. Former Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin has sharply condemned the march to Romania. In a letter to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, released on 7 July, Voronin accused Bucharest of fomenting \\"the destruction and annexation of Moldova\\". = Autumn protests = Tens of thousands demonstrating in central Chișinău on 6 September Tents installed in the town of \\"Dignity and Freedom\\", as protesters dubbed their encampment in front of PM office. Demonstrators marching with anti-oligarchic banners on Alexander Pushkin Street Tens of thousands of people manifested in Chișinău at the call of the Justice and Truth Platform. According to police, between 35,000 and 40,000 people attended the demonstration, while organizers estimated around 100,000 participants. The protest was the biggest since Moldova's independence movement in the early 1990s, bigger even than the mass anti-communist protests of April 2009. Participants adopted a resolution demanding early elections, the resignation of President Nicolae Timofti and all leading institutions of law, including the Prosecutor General's office and the National Anticorruption Center. Targeted by protests, Vladimir Plahotniuc, politician and influential businessman, fled the country after the 6 September demonstration. Clashes broke out with police at the prosecutor general's headquarters, where activists attempted to set up an occupy-style tent encampment. Opposition leaders have accused the prosecutor general of being an instrument of political persecution. Supporters of the radical left Red Bloc Party tried to break the police cordon and forcibly enter the prosecutor's office. Police detained seven activists, including Antifa movement leader, Grigory Petrenko. A team from a local television station in Moldova was accosted by demonstrators. Likewise, six policemen were injured and one woman was hospitalised. According to Interior Minister Oleg Balan, \\"their scope was to devastate the prosecutor's office\\". Police removed tents in front of the prosecutor's office. However, more than 90 tents were set up by protesters in Grand National Assembly Square, vowing to continue their protest until demands are met. Three Russian journalists from the pro-Kremlin television LifeNews were detained at Chișinău International Airport. They were forbidden to enter the Republic of Moldova. The film crew intended to publicize the protests. Russian officials reacted to the arrest of three journalists. \\"Actions of the new leadership in Chișinău demonstrate their unwillingness to have constructive relations with Russia\\", stated Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry. In the same context, Zakharova mentions that authorities' actions against Russian journalists \\"violate freedom of speech and access to information\\". Prime Minister Valeriu Streleț invited protest organisers to \\"talks\\", at the Ministry of Agriculture headquarters, but they announced they will not attend the meeting. A group of representatives of the Platform previously participated in a meeting with Streleț, at the Government headquarters, where they asked him to sign the list of claims, which was presented in the square. Amid the protests against the oligarchic regime, Vladimir Plahotniuc fled Moldova the same day for Geneva. Concomitantly with the meeting, the Unité phone company, belonging state-owned telco Moldtelecom, announced intentions to organise a free, open air concert, immediately criticised as an attempt to undermine the protest. Under the pressure of comments on social networks, many artists, starting with Ștefan Bănică, Jr., have declined participation, which could be interpreted as a political gesture. A week later, another major protest took place in Chișinău, attracting 20,000 people from all over Moldova. Clashes between supporters of the Dignity and Justice civic platform and a group advocating Moldova's unification with Romania broke out soon after the rally began. The city centre has been cordoned off and many law enforcers were deployed on the streets. A resolution was adopted at the end of the demonstration, in which protesters call for a general strike and formation of a political movement and a so- called government of popular trust. On 29 November, another protest organized by DA Platform took place in the Grand National Assembly Square. Demonstrators and supporters of the platform have expressed dissatisfaction with the political and economic situation in the country and called for early elections. To ensure security, hundreds of police formed two cordons in front of the Government. During the protest, DA Platform representatives said they will create a political party. Protests also took place in Bălți, Orhei, Cahul, Hîncești, Ungheni and Soroca. = Political crisis = Protests in the wake of 2016 political crisis On 13 January 2016, 56 deputies of the parliamentary coalition formed around PD proposed controversial businessman Vlad Plahotniuc for the position of prime minister. The proposal was immediately rejected by President Nicolae Timofti, invoking integrity reasons. Timofti asked coalition representatives to propose another name until 14 January at 12 a.m. In the evening of 13 January, the coalition announced that will propose again Plahotniuc, thus escalating the constitutional conflict. The same day, two rallies took place in Chișinău, one that supports Vlad Plahotniuc for the position of prime minister and another that opposes the nomination. Next day, protests continued, with tens of thousands of people demonstrating in central Chișinău against Plahotniuc. By night, Timofti nominated the Secretary General of the Presidency, Ion Păduraru, candidate for this position, defying PD's proposal. However, Ion Păduraru announced his withdrawal from the race in less than 24 hours after the announcement of his nomination. He justified his gesture by the fact that the parliamentary majority has already nominated another proposal of premier, and President Timofti will consider it as a compromise solution. On 16 January, the parliamentary coalition grouped around the Democratic Party of Vlad Plahotniuc announced that disagrees with the proposal of President Timofti and came up with a new proposal for premier, instead of Plahotniuc – Pavel Filip. Later that day, up to 20,000 people joined three different rallies that were organized by both the left Socialist Party of Moldova and the centre-right Civic Platform DA. The protesters called on the Moldovan president and chief prosecutor to resign, demanding early elections and prompt measures against corruption. They also opposed the nomination of Pavel Filip to the post of Prime Minister. On 20 January, a majority of 57 MPs voted in favor of PD- backed Pavel Filip Government. During the parliamentary meeting, the Parliament building was surrounded by about 1,000 protesters that demanded the interruption of the vote. They broke a side door of the Parliament and entered the building, forcing the cordon of gendarmes. Many gendarmes offered no resistance, being dragged out of the device and giving up shields and batons. After several hours, police intervened in force, removing the protesters from the Parliament and cordoning the building off. 15 people, six protesters and nine gendarmes, suffered contusions after confrontations at Parliament. One of them was President of the Liberal Party, Mihai Ghimpu, who had his head broken, being hit by protesters while leaving the Parliament. = Renewed protests = Thousands of people calling for Moldova's reunification with Romania took to the streets of Chișinău on 27 March in a so-called \\"march of reunion\\". The rally organizers say some 50,000 people took part in the protests while police put the number at 5,000–6,000 people. The rally was meant to mark the 98th anniversary since Bessarabia was unified with the Kingdom of Romania on 27 March 1918. A bomb alert was triggered at Nicolae Sulac National Palace, during the formation of platform Sfatul Țării 2, that brings together the unionist organizations in Moldova fighting for the unification with Romania. Sappers and firefighters were deployed on the spot, but found that the alarm was false. Representatives of Voievod Movement held a counter manifestation. They were surrounded by law enforcers in order to avoid the degeneration of the situation. 2017 On 11 June 2017 a new protest took place at Chișinău: around 4.000 citizens took part at a protest against adopting a law of mixed voting system, promoted by the Democratic Party of Moldova, seen by the Venice Commission and European rights experts as inappropriate for Moldova. On 17 September 2017 a new protest took place: the protesters have manifested again against the mixed voting system.  Aftermath  Former PM and leader of PLDM, Vlad Filat, was arrested on 15 October for involvement in the $1 billion bank fraud. Former prime minister Vlad Filat, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova, was detained in parliament on 15 October over the theft of $1 billion from the banking system. Masked officers entered the Moldovan parliament to handcuff and arrest Filat, while anti-government protesters had blocked the exits to the building for most of the day to prevent him leaving. Moments earlier, the lawmakers voted to strip Filat of his parliamentary immunity. Vlad Filat is accused of passive corruption and influence peddling. He would preted bribe €250 million from Ilan Shor to determine legislative decisions to diminish the position of the Moldovan state in the Savings Bank. Ilan Shor, Mayor of Orhei, is also accused in the \\"Robbery of the century\\" corruption case, as the media named the $1 billion bank fraud. On 16 October, the National Bank of Moldova has withdrawn the licenses of financial activity for Savings Bank, Social Bank and Unibank. Thus has begun the process of liquidation thereof. On 29 October, three months after formation, the Streleț government was dismissed through a motion of censure, voted in favour by 65 MPs. The government's dismissal was enacted through the votes of the Socialist, Communist, and Democratic Party deputies. The stated reason underlying the motion was \\"suspicion of the corruption of Prime Minister Valeriu Streleț\\". Soon after the vote, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted, saying that stability of government should be allowed to prevail and the pro-European mandate given in the results of the November 2014 elections should be executed.  Reactions = Domestic = Igor Dodon, leader of the country's largest opposition party, the influential Moscow-friendly Socialist Party, has denounced the government's silence toward what he described as \\"officials and representatives of right-wing extremist, nationalist and \\"neo-Nazi\\" groups from Romania who attended the 5 July gathering. After a first meeting with the leaders of the protesters, Moldovan PM Valeriu Streleț stated that his government would resign only in case of a no-confidence vote in Parliament. In a message published on the Presidency page, Nicolae Timofti cataloged the 6 September demonstration as a democratic exercise. As for his resignation, Timofti said he won't resign because \\"such a decision would bring instability to the Republic of Moldova\\". According to Dorin Chirtoacă, Mayor of Chișinău, pressure from society must exist, but organizers of protests should correctly calculate their forces and actions. He also stated that eventual early elections would further destabilize the situation in Moldova. A similar position was adopted by Moldova's parliament speaker, Andrian Candu, saying such a move would leave the country stuck in economic crisis. During the September protests, Dorin Chirtoacă has called for the tents to be removed from the central boulevard and claimed that not only is the protest illegal, but that it is being fomented by Moscow. He has claimed that Renato Usatîi and Igor Dodon are puppets of Vladimir Putin. = International =Official reactions=Supranational organisations= * In response to the $1 billion bank fraud, the EU, International Monetary Fund and World Bank have frozen their financial assistance to Moldova.Moldova anger grows over banking scandal, BBC News (14 September 2015) * UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al- Hussein, has called on authorities in Moldova to address the demands of protesters, warning that a failure to do so \\"could lead to greater polarization of society\\". =States= * Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta expressed his concern about the situation in Moldova, that, in his opinion, is \\"worse than last year\\", but says that he supports his counterpart in Chișinău and Moldova's European course. Ponta is a vocal supporter of Romania's reunification. In September 2014, he gave a speech at Alba Iulia, stating that \\"my commitment is to jointly make a second Great Union of Romania\\". During a meeting of the Presidents of Romania and Moldova in Suceava, Klaus Iohannis stated that \\"people on both sides of the Prut\\" will be found in one day not only in the EU, but also \\"in communion\\", adding that \\"we will be there for Moldovan citizens no matter how much effort we have to exert and how much will last\\". :On 26 January 2016, the Government of Romania offered a €60 million loan to help stave off economic collapse. To get the money, Prime Minister Dacian Cioloș said Moldova will have to reform its justice system, fight corruption, sign a draft agreement for a loan from the International Monetary Fund and appoint a new central bank governor. * According to the United States Embassy in Chișinău, protests highlight the frustration experienced by many Moldovans due to lack of reforms in their country. American diplomats support the right of citizens to protest peacefully, urging Moldova's Government to quickly implement the necessary reforms, such as expanding anti-corruption efforts. Others * According to Stratfor, protests could threaten the stability of Moldova's fragile government. Consequently, the possible weakening or collapse of the Moldovan government \\"could slow Moldova's European integration\\". A similar analysis from Stratfor shows that \\"the recent rallies and the positive reaction from top Romanian officials are signs of increasing Romanian influence in Moldova\\". * / Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, now Governor of Ukrainian Odessa Oblast, considers that protests taking place in Chișinău are \\"an anti- oligarchic movement which answers Ukraine's aspirations\\". \\"It is known that, in recent years, Moldovan oligarchs began to control everything. They control all state bodies, most of the Parliament and almost entirely the premier. When former prime minister [Chiril Gaburici] tried to change something, was immediately put on the table a file with compromising materials. This is a typical oligarchic style\\", concluded Saakashvili. Likewise, Saakashvili deems \\"the people come out on street to protest against oligarchs, but not in the favor of Russia. I think that the whole population of the Republic of Moldova is for Europe, and among youth it is an absolute majority\\". * In an article published by the news agency RIA Novosti, President of the Center for Systematic Analysis and Forecasting in Moscow, Rostislav Ishchenko, says that events in the Republic of Moldova remind of the \\"orange\\" scenario. According to the author, all \\"colored\\" coups were organized and guided by the United States, and the embassies were coordination centres for protesters, scenario also \\"applied\\" in Moldova. Moreover, Russian analyst writes that \\"rumors that make connections between protesters and EU, particularly Germany, country from where would be financed the DJ Platform, are identical to those linking the protests in Kiev and financiers in Germany\\".

Education Phillips was a student in electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He was also a researcher for Carnegie Mellon and then a research scientist at the Spoken Language Systems group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he helped to develop VOYAGER, an “urban navigation and exploration system” that could recognize and interpret basic spoken queries. VOYAGER was one of the first research systems to combine speech recognition and natural language processing to have a conversation with a user. Career In 1994, Phillips co-founded and became CTO of Boston-based SpeechWorks, which became one of the leading US-based vendors of speech recognition technology at the time, alongside Nuance Communications and IBM. The startup developed interactive voice response systems, including call-center interfaces for clients including Amtrak and FedEx. SpeechWorks’ technology worked for call- center interfaces because the customer could verbally answer questions posed by the human-sounding speech recognition program, rather than navigating through a menu. The technology also had time-saving “barge-in” capabilities, meaning that a customer could interrupt the system before it finished offering the full list of options. The system could also “learn.” It kept a record of names or phrases customers had used in the past so that it could learn to understand names and phrases that slightly differed from its original vocabulary. SpeechWorks’ value more than tripled after its initial public offering, and it was acquired by ScanSoft in 2003. While Phillips was CTO at ScanSoft, he worked on technologies across the company's products, including the leading dictation software Dragon NaturallySpeaking. ScanSoft then acquired Nuance Communications in 2005, and adopted the latter's name. Phillips returned to MIT as a visiting scientist and co-founded Vlingo in 2006, with former SpeechWorks colleague John Nguyen. An intelligent software assistant, Vlingo is a speech-to-text application integrated with user-facing apps for iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and other smartphones. Vlingo software allowed users to text and navigate smartphones via voice recognition. The first cell phone speech recognition software that successfully interpreted user input and learned over time, the software would later be adapted into the popular personal assistant software Siri. In 2008, Nuance Communications attempted to sue Vlingo on the grounds of patent infringement. Phillips was offered the choice to either sell Vlingo to Nuance or be sued. After six lengthy lawsuits, Phillips won, but the $3 million in legal fees drained his company's research and development funds. Vlingo was sold to Nuance in December 2011. In 2013, Phillips co-founded a startup, Sense Labs. Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Sense home energy monitor is an in-development device. Once attached to a home's electric panel, it “listens” to a home's electricity usage and identifies the wattage various appliances draw. The first wave of Sense energy monitors began shipping in early December 2015. Phillips has served on various boards and holds more than 20 patents.

He is known for his irreverent approach to design, adventurous programming of venues, and a multicultural audience. Becker is part of a second wave of New York City restaurateurs, that incorporated nightlife and theatrical elements into their design driven venues. A tightly curated guest list, staff casting, styling, and expert music selection were essential elements to this generation of hospitality operators, in addition to the traditional culinary focus. Becker in particular is known for using vernacular design references and transforming previously “undesirable spaces and locations” with a kind of Cinderella effect. Becker was dubbed a “Cultural Engineer” by André Balazs in the New York Times for his innovative creations and prescient timing.  Biography  Born in Paris in 1961 and raised in Zürich from age 8. Serge Becker is the son of Ruth Becker, a Swiss Theatre and TV administrator and a Vietnamese Father. He studied graphic design at Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich from 1977-1982. While studying he worked at night as a DJ at popular local clubs. Together with photographer Pietro Mattioli he selected records at one of Zürich’s early punk evenings, documented in the book 1977. In the early 80’s he started to book early New York City rap performers like Kurtis Blow, Davey D, and Grandmaster DST to help introduce this burgeoning culture to Switzerland. Inspired by that raw energy, he moved to New York City in 1982, where he started a 3-year stint as art director at the art nightclub AREA. This led to a 15 year long creative partnership with AREA co-founder Eric Goode. Together they designed and operated seminal New York City clubs and restaurants, directed music videos, and produced art and photography. In 1998 Becker joined George C. Wolfe, Josh Pickard and Paul Salmon to open Joe's Pub at The Public Theater. The same year he started the multi-disciplinary design firm Can Resources with architect Derek Sanders and creative director Lisa Ano (of M & Co.). The office designed multiple commercial and residential projects including the beloved Flower Box Building in the East Village. In 2000 Ano and Becker also launched the critically acclaimed cult magazine List, a publication presenting all content in list format. It was an instant hit but the magazine and Can Resources both fell victim to the dot-com bubble crash and 9/11. In 2004 Becker and Sanders joined artists Thomas Sandbichler and Jeff Gompertz to open the multi-media art club Volume in North Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The short-lived venue was a trailblazer for the coming development of the neighborhood and set a high standard for innovative immersive cultural programming. In 2005 Becker and Sanders opened the Mexican restaurant restaurant and bar La Esquina which introduced an authentic Mexico City style menu in a theatrical speakeasy environment. In 2007 Becker joined Simon Hammerstein and Richard Kimmel to open the Neo-Burlesque theatre The Box, and in 2008 Becker went back to his roots to open the Swiss Restaurant “Café Select” with his Swiss friends Oliver Stumm and Dominique Clausen of “A touch of Class” DJ and production team. In 2011 Becker connected with his Joe’s Pub partner Paul Salmon, the brothers Binn and Genc Jakupi and Meriem Soliman to open the Jamaican concept venue Miss Lily’s. In 2012 Becker ventured to London to open Mexican restaurant La Bodega Negra with local restaurateur Will Ricker and entrepreneur Eddie Spencer Churchill. 2016 brought a career change for Becker as he was appointed creative and artistic director of the New York Museum of Sex by owner Dan Gluck. His extensive brief was to help Gluck expand the museum into a full two building, eight gallery institution, broaden the curatorial scope, and build a robust events program. He was also tasked with helping Gluck conceptualize, curate, design, and build “Superfunland”, a cheeky large-scale immersive “journey into the erotic carnival” that opened in late 2019 to massive crowds and positive reviews.

History The church originated in 1870 as a mission to the new district of Colney Hatch by the assistant curate of Christ Church, Southgate. The church was built in 1873. In 1873 it became a consolidated chapelry, formed from Southgate and Friern Barnet parishes, with the vicar of Southgate as Patron of the new living. Attendance on census Sunday 1903 was 206 in the morning and 265 in the evening. St Paul's Parish Church has, for much of its history, embraced a Churchmanship that tries to reach out to worshippers wherever they are in the liturgical tradition. This has included a more Anglo-Catholic approach which began with the introduction of High Mass in 1914. Services were held in a temporary building in Ely Place until a church was built on land between Betstyle Road (later High Road) and Woodland Road probably given by G. Knights Smith, one of the largest subscribers. The foundation stone was laid in 1872 and the church, built of stone in the Early English style under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott, was consecrated in 1873. It consists of chancel with north and south chapels and south bell turret and aisled nave. The fabric, which was severely damaged by bombing in 1944, was restored by R. S. Morris by 1957. A stone vicarage, built in Woodland Road opposite the church in 1878–80, was demolished in 1964, and was replaced by a purpose-built vicarage on land in the churchyard, to the west of the church. A parish hall was built to the north of the church in 1908, and partially rebuilt in 1952.

It ran from Opeongo Lake to Whitney, where it connected to the Canada Atlantic Railway (CAR), running a total distance of about . It opened in 1902 and closed in the 1920s with the end of major logging operations in the area. The southern end of the former route was taken over as the basis of Ontario Highway 60 for a section west of Whitney in Algonquin Park, while the northern end to Opeongo Lake is now used as a park access road. Only a short section of the original railbed is no longer used, abandoned when the highway was constructed further west. History The line was built by the St. Anthony Lumber Company, who set up sawmill operations in the Whitney area starting in 1894. The mill was a major stop on the CAR, with an extensive switch yard extending on the south side of town along the east bank of Galeairy Lake. Construction of the W&OR; by the Ottawa contractor Thomas McLaughlin began in May or June 1902. The line was completed in November 1902 at the relatively high cost of $200,000 due to a number of rock cuts. It entered service in June 1903. The railway was heralded as a \\"revolution\\" in the lumber industry, reducing the time to get logs to the mills to twenty-four hours, where it used to take as long as six months. The northern end of the line connected to the southern end of Opeongo Lake, one of the largest lakes in the area, allowing timber to be floated to that point from a wide area across the center of the park area. It replaced a river-based route that was some 50 miles long and took days to traverse. The line was fairly active, and by 1904 the company was running four trains a day carrying a total of 2,000 logs. The mill was purchased by the Munn Lumber company in 1910, itself recently purchased by James Brockett Tudhope, to supply hardwood to his furniture company in Orillia. Munn became infamous for their clearcutting of Algonquin Park, and caused a serious backlash when they proposed to cut around the Highland Inn. In response, the Department of Lands, Forests and Mines purchased Munn for $290,000 and closed down its operations. The Whitney mill was sold to Dennis Canadian in the winter of 1912/13, who continued to use the line periodically into the 1920s. The company closed operations in 1922, and the town lost its only source of power when the millstock burned down in 1923. The line was officially abandoned in 1926. With the construction of Highway 60 beginning in the 1930s, the railbed provided a convenient route during construction. In 1905 the CAR was purchased by the Grand Trunk Railway and thus became part of Canadian National Railways (CN) in the 1920s. In 1933 the CAR was severed between Two Rivers and Algonquin Park Station when a trestle washed out, reportedly due to the construction of a beaver dam. By this time traffic on the line was too low to justify rebuilding the bridge, and the line operated as two separate sections. Service west of Whitney to Two Rivers ended on 31 December 1946 and the rails were lifted in the summer of 1952. This gave the W&OR; wye at Whitney a new life as the main turnaround point for trains on the eastern end of the CAR. Services along the entire CAR route finally ended in the 1960s. Route :Route data from Canadian Rail and matched on the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Topographical Map Service. The line started in Whitney, running northwest out of town to pass between Whitney Lake and West Smith Lake. It then ran almost due north to Little McCauley Lake before turning almost due west to Costello Lake. On the western side of Costello it turned north- northwest until ending at Sproule Bay, the southernmost point on Opeongo Lake. Highway 60 follows the original route out of Whitney until it reaches West Smith Lake, where the highway continues northwestward, around Brewer Lake, and then rejoins the original route for a short distance to Costello. The highway then turns west-southwest and leaves the area. The section northwest of Costello is now used as the Opeongo Road.

The village grew as a crossroads industrial center through the mid-19th century, and experienced relatively little growth afterward. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The town of Wilmington is located in rural southern Windham County, with its village center at the junction of Vermont Routes 9 and 100. Route 9 is the principal east-west route across southern Vermont, and Route 100 is the principal north-south route traversing the state on the eastern flank of the Green Mountains. The two roads meet at the North Branch Deerfield River, which historically provided the power for the village's industries. The historic district extends along Route 9 from Beaver Street in the east to the Valley Trail in the west, and along Route 100 from Beaver Street in the south to just beyond Lisle Hill Road in the north. The district has 59 historically significant buildings, and only five that are not. Most of these buildings were built in the 19th century, in vernacular versions of popular architectural styles. Particularly sophisticated buildings include the Crafts Inn and Memorial Hall, both turn of the 20th century buildings attributed to McKim, Mead & White. The town of Wilmington was chartered in 1757, with a second conflicting charter issued in 1764. This delayed development of the town until the 1770s. The original town center was located on top of Lisle Hill, northeast of the present village, but was relocated when the confluence of stage routes and the river provided economic impetus for its move. Some of the village's buildings were physically moved as part of the transition. The stage route that became Route 9 was built through the area in 1831, and mills (none of which have survived) lined the river.

James was born in Camden, South Carolina, April 19, 1805. His grandfather, John James, was a Captain in General Marion's command in the American Revolution. His father, Samuel James, who had been a member of the South Carolina legislature, emigrated to the neighborhood of Jackson, in Clarke County, south-western Alabama, in 1818, but soon died, leaving a numerous family to the care of his wife, who was a sister of Col. John Darrington, of South Carolina. He entered Yale College in 1822 from a private school in Jamaica, L. I., and graduated in 1825. Returning to Alabama, he married in 1827 Eliza, daughter of Gen. John Scott, of Montgomery, and settled on a plantation in the western part of Montgomery County, afterwards embraced in the new county of Lowndes. He was a successful planter, brought up a large family of children, and owned 103 slaves. He represented the county in the Alabama State Senate in 1835. Removing again to Clarke County, where his mother still resided, he represented that county in the Alabama House of Representatives in 1849, and in the Senate in 1851. During the American Civil War, he led a vigilance committee which dealt out brutal violence to Union supporters, and despite the Union's victory, continued to hold local political offices afterwards. His large property, however, was destroyed by the results of the war. Northern friends who heard of his reverses advised his opening an office in Montgomery for the purchase of cotton on commission for their factories, and he did so with some success. His wife died in 1872, and in 1875 he was again married to Margaret Briscoe, of Georgetown, Ky., who survived him. His last years were spent in Cincinnati, Ohio, and he died on September 19, 1888, in his 84th year, worn out with old age and infirmities, in Petoskey, Mich. He had visited that place annually for several years, on account of hay fever, from which he had long been a sufferer.

The piece was created around 1619 during the early stage of Velázquez's artistic career before he moved to Madrid. At this stage of Velazquez's career he was deeply influenced by Caravaggio. In the image, Saint Paul is seated holding a book, commonly referenced as a large Gospel book.  Image description  The painting was created using oil on canvas. The artist from Seville reveals his mastery of portraiture in the image of a man captured directly from nature and wrapped in a wide robe in which the folds are almost sculptural. The dramatic lighting that brings the figure into relief against a dark background is a style inherited from Tenebrism, as are the earth-tone colors commonly used by Velázquez. They present to the viewer a natural and authentic representation of the figure. The saint is sitting on a stone plinth that blends with the background area. The fingers of the left hand grasp a thick book. Perhaps to hide his limitations, Velázquez has hidden the legs and most of the hands under its folds. According to José López-Rey, Saint Paul's head is \\"sharply drawn\\" and the image itself is \\"somewhat rubbed and darkened\\", a style typical of Velázquez's early works. According to the New Testament, Paul was traveling to Damascus when he saw a bea of light and was visited by Jesus, who struck him blind. Three days later, Paul regained his sight and began to preach Christianity to the people. In this painting, Saint Paul is depicted wearing a large brown robe to symbolize his pilgrimage from the Holy Land to Damascus. The loose and thick cloak contains numerous creases, which suggest the heaviness of the fabric draping over a reddish/brown tunic. Saint Paul is commonly drawn with a tapering beard, brown hair, and a balding forehead to signify great wisdom and learning. However, Velázquez's image depicts Saint Paul with black hair that has a hint of grey in it, a very uncommon attribute for this figure. Velázquez's image of Saint Paul holds a blank stare, perhaps referencing his loss of eyesight from the legend. The text in the upper-left hand corner identifies the figure as S. PAVLVS (which means \\"Saint Paul\\" in Latin). He is depicted without the sword, his only known attribute. (If not holding a book, Saint Paul is more grimly represented with a severed head and the sword that killed him, which depicts his martyrdom.) A glowing aura, or halo, around the head of the figure symbolizes that he has a sense of holiness and was canonized as a saint. Although the aura of holiness is appropriate to the subject, the work also evokes the intellectual philosophers painted by José de Ribera. Velázquez deviated from the traditional representation of Saint Paul by drawing him with a book. The Gospel book that Saint Paul is holding symbolizes that this figure is an apostle and had a great influence on the spreading of the Christian religion.  History  Saint Paul was painted around 1619, before Velázquez left Seville in 1623 to become the court painter to the Spanish King, Philip IV. In 1921, August Mayer identified the painting as a work of Velázquez. This image and one of Saint Thomas (Musée des Beaux- Arts d’Orléans), also by Velázquez, are believed to have originally been housed at the Carthusian monastery of Las Cuevas in Seville. The art historian Xavier Bray says the two paintings, which are similar in their dimensions, may have been part of a series of portraits of the twelve apostles Velázquez painted while still residing in Seville, the rest of which are lost.Carr, D. W., Bray, X., Velázquez, D., & National Gallery (Great Britain). (2006). Velázquez. London: National Gallery. p. 138. . In Velázquez's early years as a painter, he was greatly influenced by Caravaggio, and the painting of Saint Paul is \\"considered a key work for understanding the influence of Caravaggio's pictorial realism in Spain.\\"  Style  The young Velázquez used influences from the classical literature of his day, like El Lazarillo de Tormes, as well as the beauty of his native country. As his career grew, he continued to use colors and objects he found in nature. He wanted to make people see his chosen subjects as they appeared to him, so he presented his figures realistically and with a \\"quality of immortal freshness.\\" Velázquez had always been a realist and was influenced by Caravaggio and Italian Renaissance painters in his youth. His use of both rough and smooth brushstrokes is \\"more akin to Titian's than to Caravaggio\\", according to José López-Rey. Velázquez was unusual among painters of his day in that he did not carefully plan his compositions or create sketches beforehand. Instead, he analyzed his models and drew completely by eye. By the time Velázquez was thirty years of age, he was already well-versed in realism and did not alter the style of his artwork. During his early career, Velázquez painted bodegones and figure paintings. Bodegones is a term that relates to \\"food, drink, or tableware.\\" The second style is the figure paintings he did between the years 1618 and 1622, which accentuate human expression. Saint Paul is an example of this style, which is a clear depiction of a somber human emotion. Only twenty of Velázquez's works have been uncovered from these early years, but it is evident that he \\"enjoyed painting portraits.\\" A \\"unifying religious undertone\\" can be viewed in the majority of Velázquez's early paintings and depict his lifelong devotion to the Catholic faith.  Relation to other artworks  thumb In 1618, Velázquez had rented a place in Seville, where watersellers roamed the streets. Between 1618 and 1620, Velázquez painted The Waterseller of Seville. The art historian Peter Cherry believes that Velázquez used a model for this image, since Velázquez was drawn to \\"humble subject matter.\\" Cherry says that the figure \\"bears a resemblance to Velázquez's early Saint Paul\\" and believes that Velázquez used the same model for The Waterseller of Seville and the 1619 painting of Saint Paul.

Born and raised in New York City, he attended Richmond Hill High School. He received his BA from Wesleyan in 1969 and his PhD from Brown in 1974, studying under Norman Rich and William F. Church. He is a professor of history at Purdue University and has held visiting positions around the world.See his curriculum vitae at: https://www.cla.purdue.edu/directory/cv/charles-ingrao.pdf In 2001, he founded and still directs “The Scholars' Initiative.\\" This project seeks to use the work of scholars to undermine nationalist interpretations of the recent past that have made peace in the Balkans difficult. As of 2011, the project had brought together over 300 scholars from 30 nations, including all of the states of the former Yugoslavia. Background Ingrao is an authority of the early modern period in Germany and Central Europe, publishing numerous books and scholarly articles on various political, economic, and cultural topics. He has served as editor of the Austrian History Yearbook (1997-2006) is Founding Editor of Purdue University Press's “Central European Studies” series (1997 to the present). In October 1991, he founded HABSBURG, \\"the first Internet discussion group dedicated to an historical theme.\\" He has been the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships including three Fulbright awards, NEH grants, and an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Fellowship. In 2015, he was awarded the “Discovery Excellence Award for the Humanities” from Purdue University. Although Ingrao initially published on the early modern history of the Habsburg monarchy and the Holy Roman Empire, he refocused his scholarship to ethnic coexistence and conflict during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Shortly after the Srebrenica massacre, he made the first of over fifty trips to the Balkan war zones to heighten public awareness of the contrast between region's history of ethnic coexistence and the humanitarian catastrophe wrought by ethnic nationalism. In 1996, he uncovered evidence of the Clinton administration's duplicity in shielding war criminals from arrest that was reported by NPR and the New York Times. This brought him into the public debate and intra-governmental struggle over US policy. By the late 1990s, he was a regular interview subject for print, radio and television news stories in Europe and North America, as well as a recurring guest on PBS's NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. His focus on the interplay of history and contemporary policymaking led to a series of nationally and internationally syndicated columns and guest lectures across North America, Europe and China before academic, governmental and military audiences, including the US State Department, several US Embassies abroad, the US Capitol, the British House of Commons, S.H.A.P.E. headquarters, and the National Defense University. The Scholars' Initiative He also helped develop “The Scholars' Initiative: Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies,” which brought both regional and international scholars together to examine the origins and course of the conflict in order to dispel myths and half-truths that disrupt dialogue and reconciliation. Over the next eight years eleven multinational research teams published four volumes. With the appearance of Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies in 2009, the project presented the first common narrative of the conflict intended to serve as the basis for mutual understanding and political moderation. The group's efforts have garnered considerable media attention both in the region and abroad, including strident criticism from the nationalist circles in Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, as well as from former Ambassador Richard Holbrooke after exposing the Clinton Administration's role in shielding Serbian wartime leader Radovan Karadžić from arrest.

The gate used to be the main western entrance of Enkhuizen and is a part of the old fortifications of the city.  Description  Between 1590 and 1593 Enkhuizen was extended toward the west. A new city wall was built with a moat and seven bastions. At the Koepoort's current location, a wooden gate and a drawbridge were built. Fifty years later plans for a stone gate spread. The Koepoort's architect is probably Jacob van Campen. In 1649 the foundation stone was put at its place, but it soon turned out that the Bentheimer sandstone used in the design coundn't be supplied. The gate was finished provisionally in 1654. Traffic was guided through the gate. Because of a paved road towards Hoorn, that was made in 1672, a big chunk of all the city's traffic came in through the gate. The Koepoort soon began to decay because of lacking maintenance. In 1730 the gate was recovered and provided with a cupola. In 1793 a clockwork was placed inside the cupola. Since 1930, the traffic is guided around the gate. The main street of Enkhuizen, the Westerstraat, ends at the Koepoort and continues as Westeinde. In 1987 a statue of the so called \\"Stedemaagd\\" was placed at the city side of the gate.

(originally Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage! until 2011) was a live show attraction featuring puppets of characters from Disney Junior's popular television programs, located at three Disney theme parks: Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris, Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort and Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. History=Disney's Hollywood Studios= Prior to Disney Junior – Live on Stage!, the theater was the Soundstage Restaurant from the park's opening date until November 14, 1998; the restaurant featured sets over the years from Big Business, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. Following that, the theater hosted Bear in the Big Blue House – Live on Stage from June 7, 1999 until August 4, 2001. That show closed to make room for Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage!, which opened on October 1, 2001, featuring returning characters from Bear in the Big Blue House, as well as new characters from Rolie Polie Olie, Stanley, and The Book of Pooh. In April 2005, the show replaced Rolie Polie Olie with JoJo's Circus. A re- imagined version of Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage! opened in February 2008, with some new characters from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Handy Manny, Little Einsteins, and My Friends Tigger & Pooh. The show was renamed in March 2011, following the rebranding of Playhouse Disney to Disney Junior, replacing My Friends Tigger & Pooh with Jake and the Never Land Pirates. In February 2013, the show replaced both Handy Manny and Little Einsteins, respectively, with Sofia the First and Doc McStuffins, when it was revamped again. Disney Junior – Live on Stage! closed on September 2, 2018. On December 22, 2018, the Hollywood Studios version was replaced by a new show named Disney Junior Dance Party!, featuring characters from Mickey and the Roadster Racers, Sofia The First ( Which WasVampirinaLater On), Doc McStuffins, and The Lion Guard. =Disney California Adventure= The California version of the show follows exactly the same pattern as the Florida version. Before Disney Junior – Live on Stage!, the theater was originally housed to the ABC Soap Opera Bistro from the park's opening date until November 3, 2002, which featured dining areas that are replicas of the sets from All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital. Due to its unpopularity, however, the restaurant closed to make way for Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage!, which was essentially the 2001 edition from Disney's Hollywood Studios (then known as Disney-MGM Studios), before being updated over the years up until the transition of Playhouse Disney to Disney Junior. In 2013, the show was update with segments based on Sofia the First and Doc McStuffins TV series from Disney Junior channel. On May 26, 2017, the California version was replaced by a new show named Disney Junior Dance Party!, featuring characters from Mickey and the Roadster Racers, Sofia the First, Doc McStuffins, and The Lion Guard. =Walt Disney Studios Park= When Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage! first opened, it was essentially the 2008 edition from Disney's Hollywood Studios. Despite its name change at the time of the block's rebranding, the show itself had not been updated for unknown reasons. In April of 2019, it closed to make way for the new interactive show \\"Disney Junior Dream Factory\\", set to open in 2020. Plot=Original version (2001–08)= The original Playhouse Disney – Live on Stage! began inside the world of Bear in the Big Blue House. As the show started, a cast member named Jamie (he or she) told guests they were going to visit Bear in his home. After some audience participation, Bear appeared on stage having just returned home from a walk. He and Jamie then lead the audience in singing \\"Welcome to the Blue House.\\" As they were singing, other characters from the television series including Tutter, Ojo, Treelo, Pip and Pop joined in. After the song ended, the cast decided to dance in order to do something special for their guests. Although all the other characters were dancing, Tutter the mouse reluctantly admitted that he couldn't dance due to the fact that he was too shy. In order to help Tutter, Bear and Jamie decided to tell him some stories. Rolie Polie Olie Jamie then turned Bear's house into a book, which then turned its page to reveal Olie Polie and his friends from Rolie Polie Olie. In the story, Zowie (Olie's sister) is supposed to be pretending to be a monster. In order to help her, Jamie suggested that the audience also pretend. Zowie, Olie, and their friend Billy Bevel all pretended that they were trapped in a vortex and began to twirl. Jamie then told the audience to twirl with them. After the story, Tutter appeared back on stage; he agreed that although it was fun to laugh and play with your friends, he still felt too shy. Bubbles also fill the room while the song is playing. Stanley Since Tutter was still feeling shy, Jamie decided to tell Tutter another story, this time from Stanley. Stanley told Dennis that he was sad, because he had to wash up and go to bed. Stanley then said that he wished he was a gorilla, so that he didn't have to wash. After Dennis told him that gorillas are very clean, he and Stanley decided to look up the animal in the Great Big Book of Everything. Inside the book, Stanley learned that gorillas were large animals that were very clean. After reading about the ape, a large gorilla appeared in Stanley’s room. Stanley and the audience then pounded on their chest in order to say hello. The gorilla picked through Stanley's hair, helping to clean him, before going back into the book. As the gorilla leaves, Stanley agreed that he should brush his teeth and go to bed, thanking Dennis for helping him learn. After the scene, Tutter agreed that your friends can help you learn, but he still wanted one more story. The Book of Pooh The third story took place in The Book of Pooh. The narrator told guests that Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, and Piglet were enjoying a day in the Hundred Acre Wood. Pooh, after realizing that he has a pot of honey, declared that it was a perfect day. Although Eeyore wants to take a nap, Tigger tells him that it is the perfect day for bouncing. Jamie then told guests they should join in with him. After the bouncing, Pooh observes that all of his friends have different ideas of what a perfect day is, and he wondered how they could all be right. Piglet suggested that they should ask the narrator what a perfect day is. The narrator told them that everyone has their own perfect day, because everyone is different. Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and Tigger then sang a song, celebrating their differences. After the song, Pooh realized that they forgot to ask Piglet what his perfect day is. Piglet responded that as long as he's with his friends, every day is a perfect day. The narrator then said goodbye, ending the story. Finale The scene then shifted back to Bear's house, where Bear suggested that if everyone danced, Tutter would too. Pip and Pop then sang a song, encouraging the audience (and Tutter) to dance. Tutter then thanks the audience for being such good friends. After the others left, Bear realized that they hadn’t seen Luna yet. Bear then told Luna the events of the day, before concluding that with friends, there is nothing you can't do. Bear and Luna, along with the rest of the gang, then sing the \\"Goodbye Song\\" as the show ends. =Later addition= In 2005, the Rolie Polie Olie segment was replaced with a JoJo's Circus segment. JoJo’s Circus In this scene, JoJo and her friend Skeebo were looking for Goliath the Lion who was hiding. With the audience's help, JoJo eventually found Goliath inside a cannon. After being reunited, JoJo realizes that Goliath had the hiccups. Skeebo then suggested that they surprise Goliath to get rid of the hiccups, and the audience was told to stand up and yell as loud as they could. When the whole audience yelled together, Goliath's hiccups disappeared. JoJo then taught everyone (including the audience) how to bow. Jamie then asked JoJo what she learned today, to which she replied, \\"some things are more fun if you have good friends,\\" ending the scene. Tutter then reappeared, agreeing that it was fun when friends laughed and sang together. =2008–11 version (US)/2009–2019 version (France)= The show was completely refreshed in 2008, replacing the sets and the entire shows featured. The storybook styling and puppets however remained. This is the version used in France as well, and that version has remained the same even with the name change. It begins with a cast member named Casey/Sammy (he or she) running on stage while the Playhouse Disney theme song plays. Casey/Sammy then asks the audience to yell out their names. While everyone is yelling, Mickey Mouse himself yells out his name, and then invites the audience to his clubhouse. As guests arrive at the clubhouse, Mickey and Casey/Sammy sing the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse theme song, during which Donald, Daisy, Goofy and Minnie also appear. At the clubhouse, Mickey informs guests that it's Minnie's birthday. In order to help out, Daisy agrees to hang up a \\"Happy Birthday” sign, Goofy agrees to make a cake, and Donald says that he can write a birthday song. The three then explain that it is going to be difficult for them to accomplish their tasks. Mickey and Casey/Sammy agree that the best way to solve your problems is to study stories. In order to hear some stories, Mickey and his friends call on Toodles to give them tools to help them. The three items Toodles carries, relate to other Playhouse Disney shows: Handy Manny, Little Einsteins, and My Friends Tigger and Pooh. Handy Manny The first tool that the gang uses is the toolbox from Handy Manny. Manny and his tools need to fix a bubble machine in time for the new park to open. As the tools begin work, they sing the \\"Hop Up, Jump In\\" song. Pat the hammer decides that he can fix the machine all by himself. His hammering, however, breaks the wooden base of the machine. After Pat decides he’s going to get out of the way, Manny decides that the machine's hose is broken. The rest of the tools then chip in to fix the machine, which they do while singing the \\"We Work Together\\" song. Although they initially thought they fixed the machine, the motor of the machine falls down, and Manny realizes he needs Pat to fix it. With the audience’s help, Manny and Casey/Sammy find Pat, who is able to fix the machine, while the audience chants \\"Go, Pat, go.\\" After Pat fixes the machine, bubbles fill the room and guests sing the \\"We Work Together\\" song one more time as the scene ends. Little Einsteins After the Handy Manny story, Donald decides that everybody should have a part in his song and then leaves the scene happily. Goofy complains that he is having a hard time making the cake. Casey/Sammy then decides to use another tool (Rocket), this time transporting guests to the world of Little Einsteins. Guests are informed that today’s episode is known as \\"The Great Sky Race\\" with music by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Leo and the gang then tell guests that Rocket needs their help to zoom across the sky and win the sky race, although Big Jet (another airplane) also wants to win the race. The Einsteins then agree that the best way to help Rocket is to cheer him on. To help Rocket, the audience is instructed to pat their lap slowly, and then clap their hands faster before finally raising their hands and shaking. All of these actions are done to the tune of Flight of the Bumblebee. Their encouragement leads Rocket to catch up to and eventually pass Big Jet, winning the race and ending the scene. My Friends Tigger & Pooh After the Little Einsteins story, Goofy felt that he should find a friend to help him with the cake. Daisy is upset because she hasn't been able to hang up her banner. Casey/Sammy then tells Daisy that they need to hear one more story, this time from My Friends Tigger & Pooh, as the third and final tool is the Finder Flag. The scene begins with Tigger, Pooh, and Darby hearing the Super Sleuth siren. They, along with the audience, say the Super Sleuth oath, before Roo appeared on stage, telling them that his kite was stuck in the Changing Tree. When Pooh asked how the kite got there, Roo explained that the wind knocked it into the tree. After shortly brainstorming, Tigger decided that he could bounce high enough to get the kite. Tigger then sang a short song about bouncing, while Casey/Sammy encouraged the audience to bounce along with him. After the song, the team decided that they were going to have to think some more. Pooh then suggested that everyone (including the audience) should blow the kite out of the tree. This plan worked, freeing the kite and ending the scene. Finale After Pooh's (Later Jake's) story, Daisy learned that like Roo (Later Skully), she too has friends in high places, which are the Handy Helpers. Goofy, Donald, and Mickey appear back on stage at the clubhouse. All of them were able to accomplish their tasks. Mickey then tells everyone to yell surprise when Minnie enters the room. After Minnie thanks everyone, Mickey, Donald, Goofy, Daisy and Casey/Sammy sing the song that Donald wrote for the occasion. Casey/Sammy then tells the audience to stand up and dance with them. Minnie later says that this is her best birthday ever, and Mickey says what made it more special was having the whole audience as their new pals. The gang then says goodbye, with Minnie and Mickey reminding the guests that they love them and will \\"see them real soon,\\" ending the show. When the show ends, the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Theme Song (Instrumental) plays. =2011–13 Version= With the name change of Playhouse Disney to Disney Junior, the show also changed its name, this time to Disney Junior – Live on Stage! The My Friends Tigger & Pooh segment was replaced with a segment based on Jake and the Never Land Pirates. Jake and the Never Land Pirates The third and final tool is the Team Treasure Chest from Jake and the Never Land Pirates, as the scene changes to the shores of Neverland. The crew finds out that Captain Hook has stolen their treasure chest. Jake uses his spyglass to try and find his chest. He eventually sees the treasure on a shipwrecked beach. As the crew goes to find their treasure, the scene shifts to Captain Hook and Mr. Smee on the island. Hook attempts to open the lock on the chest with his hook, but to no avail. Jake and his crew are then able to sneak up on Hook by disguising themselves as bushes. In order to get Hook away from the chest, Jake decides that he needs the audience to pretend that they are Tick-Tock the Crocodile. Their plan proves successful, and Jake, his crew, and the audience sing “Weigh Hey Well Done Crew,” ending the scene. =2013–18 Version= The Handy Manny and Little Einsteins segments were replaced with segments based on Sofia the First and Doc McStuffins. Sofia the First The first tool that the gang uses is the tiara from Sofia the First, as the scene shifts to the Kingdom of Enchancia. Sofia is attempting to make the flowers outside her castle sparkle for the Royal Ball, but is having no luck. Joined by Prince James and Princess Amber, Sofia eventually decides to go find Cedric for help. Cedric then appears on stage and begins to sing about how he wants to make a name for himself by impressing the King and making it snow. When Sofia asks for the sorcerer's help, Cedric eventually agrees. He tells the princess that all she needs to do is say the spell with confidence. Although Sofia wants to do her spell, Cedric tells her that she cannot because he needs to do his own spell to make it snow for the ball. Unfortunately, Cedric says the spell too fast and his spell book disappears. As the book darts around the room, Casey asks the audience to help Cedric find it. After retrieving the book, Cedric is about to try his spell again, when the group hears the announcement that the Royal Guests are arriving. Cedric becomes too nervous to perform the spell. Sofia, along with the audience, says the spell together, which makes it begin to snow. Taking what she has learned, Sofia tries her spell again, this time \\"slow and steady.\\" The princess' spell works and the flowers outside the castle begin to sparkle. Seeing her success, Sofia sings the song, \\"Anything.\\" After hearing Sofia's story, Donald learned he should write a \\"sing together\\" song for a party for everyone. Doc McStuffins The second tool is the stethoscope from Doc McStuffins, as the scene changes to Doc's clinic playhouse. Here, she is joined by Lambie, Chilly, Hallie and Stuffy. Doc asks what everyone wants to do, after which Lambie suggests that everyone should dance with her; they start to \\"boogie.\\" After the dance, Stuffy gets out of control and knocks over Lambie, causing her tutu to rip. Lambie then says she knows Stuffy didn't mean to rip her tutu, and she asks Doc to fix her. The whole group then sing \\"Time for Your Check Up,\\" before Doc says that she is diagnosing Lambie with the \\"rippies.\\" Hallie then says they need to look in the Big Book of Boo Boos. Doc agrees, but also says that she needs her magnifying glass. Stuffy tries to help by reaching it, but instead drops it, knocking the soap which causes bubbles to go everywhere. Doc notes that she cannot fix Lambie with bubbles all everywhere. Casey then encourages the audience to help pop all the bubbles, which they do. After the bubbles are popped, Doc asks Lambie if she needs anything else before she starts. Lambie agrees says that she is a little scared, and she could use a cuddle. Hallie then pops up with a magnifying glass and begins to chant \\"you can do it\\" as Doc fixes Lambie. Lambie then sings, \\"I Feel Better.\\" Doc then tells Lambie that \\"when your friends cheer you on, there's nothing you can't do.\\" Lambie then says that now that she feels better, they should start dancing again. After everyone dances, Doc and her friends leave the stage as Goofy reappears. Casey then asks Goofy what he learned from the story, and Goofy says he is going to find a friend to cheer him on as he'll try to bake the cake. Meet and Greets Outside the theater at Disney's Hollywood Studios, there are meet-and-greet areas for Pluto and the titular characters from Vampirina, Fancy Nancy and Doc McStuffins.

The text, along with the Niralamba Upanishad, is one of two dedicated glossaries embedded inside the collection of ancient and medieval era 108 Upanishads. The text exists in two versions, one attached to the Atharvaveda in many Sanskrit anthologies, and another attached to the Krishna Yajurveda in some anthologies such as the Telugu-language version. The two versions have some differences, but are essentially similar in meaning. Sarvasara Upanishad defines and explains 23 Upanishadic concepts, while Niralamba Upanishad covers 29.A Weber (1885), Die Niralambopanishad, Lehre vom Absoluten, Ind. Stud. XVII, pages 136–160 (in German) These two texts overlap in some concepts, both refer to older Principal Upanishads (dated to 1st millennium BCE), but offer independent explanations suggesting that accepting a diversity of views were a part of its tradition.  History  The date and author of Sarvasara Upanishad is unknown, but it is likely a late medieval text like the Muktika Upanishad. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Sarva-Upanisatsara, Sarva Upanishad, Sarvasar Upanishad,Anand Dhruva (2001), The Way Beyond Any Way: Talks on Sarvasar Upanishad, Rebel, Sarva-upanishad-sara and Sarvasaropanishad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 572–573 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 33. The text is also found in the early 19th-century Henry Thomas Colebrooke anthology of Upanishads popular in North India, and in the Narayana compilation of Upanishads popular in South India.In the collection of Upanishads under the title \\"Oupanekhat\\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Sarvasara is listed at number 11 and is named Sarb. Oupanekhat also lists Sarbsar, but both Max Müller and Paul Deussen state that the misnamed text in the Persian compilation is not Sarvasar Upanishad.  Contents  The Sarvasara Upanishad is written in the style of glossary of Vedanta terms. The text begins by listing twenty three questions, such as what is Moksha, what is Avidya and what is Vidya? It then follows with twenty three answers. The manuscript version of the Sarvasara Upanishad in Atharvaveda discuss the last two questions differently than the manuscript of the same text attached to the Krishna Yajurveda. The glossary in Sarvasara Upanishad in collections where it attached to Atharvaveda, covers the following twenty three words: Bandha (bondage), Moksha (liberation), Avidya (incorrect knowledge), Vidya (correct knowledge), Jagrat (waking consciousness), Swapna (dream sleep consciousness), Sushupti (dreamless deep sleep consciousness), Turiyam (fourth stage of consciousness), Annamaya, Pranamaya, Manomaya, Vijnanamaya, Anandamaya, Kartar, Jiva, Kshetrajna, Saksin, Kutastha, Antaryamin, Pratyagatman, Paramatman, Atman and Maya. The glossary in manuscript versions, found in different parts of India, where the text is attached to Krishna Yajurveda include a more extensive discussion of the following concepts in the last two questions: Brahman (ultimate reality), Satya (truth), Jnana (wisdom), Ananta (eternal), Ananda (bliss), Mithya (illusion) and Maya (not Atman). The first 21 of 23 questions in both versions cover the same topics. Brahman, in the Sarvasara text, is Absolute Consciousness, without a second, a Be-ness, nondual, pure, the noumenal, the true and the unchanging. Satya, states the Upanishad, is Sat (Be-ness), what is not Asat (not-Be-ness), that which the Vedas aim at, that neither changes with time nor is affected by time, that which existed in past and exists now and will exist in future without change, that which is the fountainhead of all ideas and all causes. The explanation of Maya in the Sarvasara Upanishad has been referenced in modern scholarship.Ramampada Chattopadhyay (1992), A Vaiṣṇava Interpretation of the Brahmasūtras, BRILL Academic, , pages 60–61J Sinha (2007), Indian Psychology, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 2 with footnotes 13 and 14 According to Chattopadhyay, the Sarvasara definition is of the Shruti (Hindu scripture). Maya, states Sarvasara, means that \\"which is neither unreal (non-existent), nor real (existent), and nor is it simultaneously existent and non-existent; it is that which has no beginning but has an end; it is that which exists in the empirical plane in so far as one does not imagine it, it is that which is ever changing and non-Atman\\".

He held the Abul Kalam Azad Chair at the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration, New Delhi during 2009-2016. = Works and reception = Situating the History of Science: Dialogues with Joseph Needham  The book was subject to mixed receptions. A review over The American Historical Review deemed it to be a carelessly edited book with shoddy introductions and unresolved dissonance across the participating authors. A review over Technology and Culture noted it to be an exciting and enriching volume. A review over Indian Economic and Social History Review disagreed with the excessive put down of Bernalism and other aspects but went on to note it as a very important volume in affirmation of the enduring relevance of Joseph Needham's thought school.  Domesticating Modern Science: A Social History of Science and Culture in Colonial India  The book contained a collection of essays from various journals and prominent publications that focused on how the first generation of scientists in post- Reneissance India responded to and appropriated the theories and practices of modern science into their cultural traditions, often conflicting among themselves but yet working towards a common goal of achieving freedom from colonialism. A review over Social Scientist was positive and noted the work to be an impressive collection of informative and conceptually agile essays from a multitude of disciplines.  To Make the Deaf Hear: Ideology and Programme of Bhagat Singh and His Comrades  Syed's work on Bhagat Singh and his comrades focuses on the range of ideological processes which led to Bhagat Singh's thought-school of revolutionary philosophy and corresponding political manifesto. K.N. Panikkar, in his review of the book, praised the meticulous documentation and scholarly analysis in the work.  Social History of Science in Colonial India  A collection of twelve essays on the topic of colonialism and science in India, it was intended to serve as a general introduction to a reader. Critical reception was mixed. A review over Cultural and Social History noted the work to provide an useful overview but criticized multiple aspects; many of the essays ran along parallel themes with non- optimal selections, there was an acute lack of intersection with social history contra the stated purpose of the book and that the language was often too sophisticated and abstract, for the intended audience. A review over the Indian Journal of History of Science was scathing; it noted the sole endeavor of the book to demonstrate western efficiency and Indian deficiency in the progress of science. A review over Current Science praised multiple aspects of the volume and went on to note it as a valuable and impressive addition to the field esp. to potential students. A review over Journal of Social History admired the multitude of viewpoints in the collection of essays and noted it to be an indispensable contribution to the field. A review over Indian Historical Review noted all the selected essays to be products of insightful analyses and that the work will serve as a valuable introduction to graduate students in the domain. A review over Contributions to Indian Sociology noted it to be an useful work, as well.  Jihad Or Ijtihad : Religious Orthodoxy And Modern Science In Contemporary Islam  The Hindu reviewed it as a timely scholarship which shone a spotlight on longstanding scientific discourses and rational thought schools in Islam.Author and literary critic Us Salam Ziya deemed it to be a brilliant work with insightful scholarly arguments.  Indian Nationalism: The Essential Writings  The book was subject to widespread positive reception. Irfan Habib noted it to be a comprehensive but careful selection of writings that represented all the major ideological schools of the National Movement; Irfan's introduction and biographical sketches were especially admired. A review over Kitaab.org noted it's immense topical relevance at a time, when a muscular, hyper-patriotic and jingoistic band of nationalism is being increasingly thrust upon the citizens and noted Irfan to have perfected the near-impossible task of summarizing a diverse set of pluralistic ideas, with appropriate commentary. Syed expressed similar motivations, upon the launch of the book. C P Bhambri, former dean of the School of Social Sciences, JNU noted the book to provide a plethora of insights about the idea of nationalism in India and deemed it to be a necessary read in light of the current climate.  Inquilab: Bhagat Singh on Religion and Revolution  Consisting of a selected collection of Bhagat Singh's writings, the work located them in the context of contemporary nationalism. Irfan Habib noted it to be a thoughtful collection and deemed Syed's introduction to be insightful, which identified the core elements of Bhagat Singh's ideology in a clear manner. C P Bhambri, former dean of the School of Social Sciences, JNU noted the volume to have done yeoman's service in correcting stereotyped notions about Singh's philosophy and in showing the need for widespread assimilation of his thought school instead of the token gratitude, bestowed on Singh, as a revolutionary martyr.

The Charleston Renaissance is a period between World Wars I and II in which the city of Charleston, South Carolina, experienced a boom in the arts as artists, writers, architects, and historical preservationists came together to improve and represent their city. The Charleston Renaissance was related to the larger interwar artistic movement known as the Southern Renaissance and is credited with helping to spur the city's tourist industry. Alice Ravenel Huger Smith, The Rector's Kitchen and View of St. Michael's, watercolor, 1910–15. Alfred Hutty, Magnolia Gardens, oil on canvas, 1920. History In the Antebellum era, Charleston was one of the ten largest cities in America. The Civil War destroyed the city's prosperity, and the economic after-effects lingered through the Reconstruction era into the early 20th century. Beginning around World War I, however, the city experienced a renaissance in the arts as the local art community worked on bettering their city and representing it in various media. The Charleston Renaissance contributed to the rise of such art institutions as the Gibbes Museum of Art (which grew out of the Carolina Art Association's gallery) and the Poetry Society of South Carolina. It lasted through the Great Depression until World War II. Writers associated with the movement include DuBose Heyward (author of the book on which the opera Porgy and Bess was based), John Bennett (author of the first scholarly work on the Gullah language), novelists Josephine Pinckney and Julia Peterkin, poets Hervey Allen, Helen von Kolnitz Hyer, and Beatrice Ravenel, and playwright Dorothy Heyward. On the institutional front, Laura Bragg became the first woman to run a publicly funded art museum in America when she became the director of the Charleston Museum. The Charleston Renaissance is most closely associated with the visual arts, however. The four leading artists of the movement are Alfred Hutty, Alice Ravenel Huger Smith, Anna Heyward Taylor, and Elizabeth O'Neill Verner. Of these, Smith and Verner were Charleston natives, while Taylor hailed from elsewhere in the state and Hutty came from New York. Other visual artists considered part of the movement include Edwin Harleston, Anne Taylor Nash, and William Posey Silva. Visiting artists such as Ellen Day Hale, Gabrielle D. Clements, Edward Hopper, and Childe Hassam are sometimes included in the group. The Charleston Renaissance artists' oil paintings, watercolors, and prints documented Charleston and the South Carolina Lowcountry around the city through sometimes romanticized landscapes, architectural studies, and scenes of daily life past and present. Critics have noted that the generally nostalgic tone of the imagery, which hovers between \\"eulogy and travelogue\\", tends to gloss over the uglier aspects of the region's history, wrapping slavery, racism, and poverty in a \\"golden haze of memory.\\" The artists specialized in prints, including woodblocks and etchings, which sold more readily to tourists and other visitors than paintings did and which helped to spread the imagery of the movement throughout the country. Local artists collectively bought a press and—influenced in part by visiting artists Hale and Clements—formed the Charleston Etchers' Club to promote printmaking as a medium. Smith, Verner, and others also banded together to champion preservation of the city's remaining historic buildings. The Preservation Society of Charleston was formed in the 1920s, and in 1928 the city's first \\"historic house\\" museum was founded. In 1931, the city gained its first historic district, which placed zoning restrictions on all historic structures in the lower part of the Charleston peninsula. In 1998, the Greenville County Museum of Art mounted a large exhibition, \\"The Charleston Renaissance,\\" which then traveled to museums in Columbia, Charleston, and Augusta (Georgia) over the next three years.

Life He was the son of Alexander Cruden, beadle at Pitsligo. He graduated M.A. at Marischal College, Aberdeen in 1743. Cruden became minister of Logie-Pert, Craigo, near Montrose, in 1753. Connection with the Relief Church In the 1760s, Cruden became involved with the foundation of the schismatic Relief Church. Its initial role was to allow congregations to bypass the nomination of ministers. Matters began with the parish of Logie, Stirlingshire (Blairlogie). There the incumbent minister, Patrick Duchall, died in 1758. Both John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore and John Erskine of Carnock claimed to be patrons, with the right to nominate to the living. While they agreed at first on a candidate, James Frame, there was intense local opposition, and Frame took another position. In 1759, Cruden received a \\"call\\" to Logie. The presbytery, however, understood that Dunmore still held to his rights; and delayed. Cruden became the Erskine candidate, through a proxy (James Haldane of Plean); Dunmore put forward James Wright. In 1760, the General Assembly on appeal reversed the decision of the local Synod, against Dunmore; and Wright was given the settlement. The local group asked the \\"Presbytery of Relief\\", formed in 1761, for support; and had a church built, which in 1762 went to John Warden. In 1765 James Baine was approached, to set up a Relief church in Edinburgh. Cruden's name was raised at an initial stage. In the end it was Baine who gained full support, and came to Edinburgh, in early 1766. Cruden came to Glasgow in 1767; again a \\"relief\\" was provided after a secession from an existing congregation. It occurred at Glasgow's Wynd Church, which had been held by a Moderate, William Craig. The church was rebuilt from 1762, Craig moving within the city, and the council brought in another like-minded minister, George Bannatyne, in 1764, over the wishes of some. Cruden then was brought to the Albion Road Chapel of the Relief Church. Some of his congregation turned against him, however, in a complicated affair involving examination of a student. He clashed also with David Dale the merchant, a member of the Albion Road congregation. Dale left, moving on to form an Independent congregation in Grey Friars Wynd. In the debates of the early 1770s within the Relief Church, Cruden lost the argument against some form of open communion. Shortly afterwards he left the church. The Albion Street congregation broke up three ways, with the group remaining with the chapel rejoining the Church of Scotland. Later life Cruden was then elected minister of the Scotch presbyterian church in Crown Court, Covent Garden, London, in 1773, in succession to Thomas Oswald. Cruden died on 5 November 1785, aged 60, and was buried in Bunhill Fields cemetery. Works Cruden's works are: *Hymns on a variety of Divine Subjects, Aberdeen, 1761. There was a later edition (1800) by Robert Carr Blackenbury. *Nature Spiritualised, in a variety of Poems, containing pious and practical observations on the works of nature, and the ordinary occurrences in life, London, 1766. *Sermons on Evangelical and Practical Subjects, London, 1787; with portrait prefixed, engraved by T. Trotter from a painting by D. Allen. Family Cruden married Clementina Hadden, and they had four children. Their son John Cruden (1754–1787) was a loyalist in British North America, and a figure of the American Revolutionary War period, in touch through his father with William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.Jeffrey J.

He was a central figure of the more radical wing of the Holiness movement. Painting of Knapp (on left), Orange Scott, and Seth Cook Rees on display at the World Methodist Museum, Lake Junaluska, NC Biography=Younger years= Martin Wells Knapp was born March 27, 1853, in Albion, Michigan, to very poor parents who lived in a log cabin. His father, Jared Knapp was a Methodist class-leader who had come from New-York to Michigan in 1836. Jared Knapp was the son of Samuel and Abigail Knapp, of Parma, Monroe County, New York. Martin’s mother, Octavia, also a committed Christian, was the daughter of Melzar and Eunice Wells, of Sullivan, Madison County, New York. Martin had two half-sisters, Mrs Letta J. Conner who died in 1866 and Mrs R. V. Buck, wife of Amos Buck, of Stevensville, Montana. Martin also had a brother, L.J. Knapp who became a lawyer in Missoula, Montana. As his father’s health was fragile, young Knapp had to help a lot on the farm. =Studies= Although Knapp was an extremely shy young man, at age 17, he began studies at a Methodist college in Albion, Michigan, on the 50 dollars his parents could give him after selling a calf. He continued to work on the family farm in the summer, never stopping his studies which he carried on during the night. Although he was always a religious boy he had a defining experience of conversion at age 19, through the fiancée he was corresponding with, Lucy J. Glenn. Martin was converted at 19 through Lucy’s prayers and his mother’s example. Soon he received his call to preach. When he was 23, he and Lucy were married.Historical note on Martin W. Knapp and Seth C. Rees, on the site of The Wesleyan Church. =Ministry= Right after his marriage, in 1877, he went on to a career in ministry, when the Methodist Michigan Conference assigned him a circuit. He was not as loud a preacher as his father had been. He was in fact very shy and unimpressive being only 5’4’’ and 120 pounds and his first impression upon strangers was almost always unfavorable. But on that first pastorate, Knapp demonstrated enough qualities to be allowed to stay on board. A turning point in Knapp’s life came on his second pastorate in November 1882. He had long been wrestling with the inner bent to sinning. Under the ministry of William Taylor, who would become later the great missionary bishop of the Methodist Church, he claimed the blessing \\"now\\" in a revival at one of his own churches, entering thereby straight into the holiness movement. In 1886, Knapp published his first book, \\"Christ Crowned Within\\", apparently selling off some of his own furniture to finance this publication. In 1887 the Michigan Conference permitted him to step out of the pastorate so he could follow the calling of an evangelist. The following year, in his mother’s kitchen, he started \\"God’s Revivalist\\", a periodical devoted to the promotion of holiness. During 1889-90, Martin W. Knapp went through a two-year period of adversity when he and his family were hit hard by disease and financial crises. The worst blow of all came on September 5, 1890, when his wife Lucy died after a long illness, leaving him with two small children. In 1892, Knapp remarried with Minnie C. Ferle and moved to Cincinnati. During the ensuing period he impressed his biographer A. M. Hills as being \\"a little bundle of nerves and brain and heart, all alive and on fire for God and holiness.\\" Judging after the results of the following years, it seems he was indeed never stopping to rest: *He set up a publishing house for holiness literature in the YMCA building. *He established the Salvation Park Camp Meeting. *He called for and initiated holiness missionary work, enlisting missionaries and through his paper and camp meeting and raising funds for them. After visiting his school Charles and Lettie Cowman changed their missionary plans from school teaching to evangelism, and went to Japan to establish the Oriental Missionary Society, now the One Mission Society. *In September 1897, the International Holiness Union and Prayer League was organized in Knapp’s home. Seth C. Rees was elected president and Martin W. Knapp vice-president. The dozen of people assembled there was intent on forming an inter-denominational society promoting holiness revivals and missions. But it later turned into the Pilgrim Holiness Church, which would eventually help form The Wesleyan Church. *In 1900 he purchased a two-acre tract of land containing two large buildings, and founded God’s Bible School there. The following year he built a new tabernacle on the campus for his camp meeting. God’s Bible School later became known as God's Bible School and College. =End of life= By early 1901 the physically overextended Knapp caught a typhoid fever. His ministry continued even on his sickbed as he inquired of the nurses if they were on their way to heaven. He died in Cincinnati on December 7, 1901, at the age of 48, leaving behind him various thriving institutions, each in its own way perpetuating his influence and his message. He was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio. Works Knapp was a prolific author of books, pamphlets and hymns; his works include: *Christ Crowned Within, 1886 *The Double Cure *Out of Egypt into Canaan, or Lessons in Spiritual Geography *Diary Letters; A Missionary Trip Through the West Indies and to South America *The River of Death and Its Branches *Pentecostal Preachers *Revival Kindlings, 1890 *Revival Tornadoes; or, Life and Labors of Rev.

McNeill (Cincinnati, Ohio: M. W. Knapp, circa 1902) Legacy Martin W. Knapp’s legacy is impressive in all accounts as his message lived on and was passed on by the institutions he had founded. His flurry of activism is best explained by the division which appeared in the late 19th century within the holiness movement, \\"between traditionalist moderates who remained loyal to the old denominations and radicals who wanted to form new bodies committed to innovative theological currents such as the eminent physical return of Jesus and divine healing. Martin Wells Knapp was the central figure in the radical coalition. While holiness moderates in the National Holiness Association (NHA) attempt a two front war against foes that they believe where either dangerous liberals or rank fanatics, Knapp focused his attention on the moderates who he believed were hopelessly tied to such passing human documents as the Apostles Creed. Early radical centers were God’s Bible School in Cincinnati and the Chicago based ministries of E. L. Harvey and Duke Farson.\\"William Kostlevy, Martin Wells Knapp and the Origins of the Radical Holiness Movement, in: Holy Jumpers: Evangelicals and Radicals in Progressive Era America, Print publication date: 2010, , published to Oxford Scholarship Online: May 2010 NotesReferences  *A Hero of Faith And Prayer: Life Of Rev.

On his initiative, he was the first clergyman to print of a book in an Arab country. Biography Sarkis Rizzi's family presented at this time three patriarchs to the Maronite Church: his two uncles Michel (1567 - 1581) and of the same name Sarkis (1581 - 1596) and his younger brother Joseph (October 3, 1596 - March 26, 1608). Youssef was abbot of the Monastery of Qozhaya in the Kadisha Valley[The Antonius monastery is one of the oldest institutions of the Maronite Church. The founding date is unknown; the first written reference is found in a marginal note in Garshuni in Rabbula Gospels of 1154.] after the election of his uncle Sarkis patriarch and was in 1595 appointed bishop. The young Sarkis belonged in 1584 to the first group of students at the Pontificio Collegio dei Maroniti in Rome.[The Jesuits had already brought in 1579 two young Maronites to Rome and four more in 1581. In 1584 there were about 20 when Pope Gregory XIII created the Maronite College of Rome, which he put over the care of the Jesuits with the Bull Ferunt Humana on July 5, 1584] Rizzi was in Rome when was ordained deacon and priest, and after that he returned to Lebanon in 1596.[The General of the Jesuits, Claudio Acquaviva, announced his ordination and his speedy return in a letter to his uncle, the Maronite Patriarch, in a letter dated on July 14, 1596] In September–October of this year he was at the Second Synod of Qannoubine. The Synod was passed through the papal legate Jerome Dandini. In this Synod, his brother Youssef was elected patriarch. He then took over his post as head of the Monastery of Qozhaya. In 1600 Rizzi was consecrated bishop by his brother (as Metropolitan of Damascus), but remained in the monastery. In 1606 he was sent by the patriarch to Rome as head of a delegation to the new Pope Paul V to give him his congratulations. He left Tripoli in October 1606 and reached Rome on 19 April 1607.[With him was also Girgis ibn Maroun from Zgharta, since 1611 envoyed of the later Emir until 1633 when Fakhr-al-Din II assumed his office. The papal throne and the Duke of Tuscany named him in 1614 bishop of Cyprus (he died on July 24, 1637).] Patriarch Youssef died on March 26, 1608. Due to difficulties that the Ottoman authorities made, the election of his successor John VIII Machlouf not take place before the beginning of 1609. The new Patriarch actually even had some time after Chouf flee. Rizzi then returned to Lebanon. Sometime between 1609-1610 he arrived there. But the new Patriarch initiated a policy of reaction against the family Rizzi, who had 40 years exercised the power in the Church. The monastery of Qozhaya was also returned to the bishop and Youssef Rizzi excommunicated. Sarkis Rizzi returned then finally to Rome, which he reached sometime before 1621. There he worked on many out lative projects: The issue of the Maronite Breviariums in 1624,[Officium simplex septem dierum Hebdomadae ad usum Ecclesiæ Maronitarum, in Collegio Maronitarum, Rome, Etienne Paulin, 1624] the pressure of the Syrian grammar of Abraham Ecchellensis in 1628,[Collegii Maronitarum alumni linguæ Syriacæ immersive Chaldaicæ perbrevis institutio ad ejusdem nationis studiosos adulescentes, Rome, Type.

This was the first book printed in Lebanon and the entire region of the Levant.[Catalog of Oriental Manuscripts of the Laurentian Library (Florence) in 1742 confirms Stefano Evodio Assemani that this pressure in Levant. 411 of the collection (n° 30 of its catalog), a Psalter in Garschuni, copied in 1528, was printed in the monastery of Qozhaya in 1585, upon the initiative of Sarkis Rizzi and Youssef Khater Assemani. However, most experts doubt the existence of this issue, of which there are no traces. Jerome Dandini, who was in 1596 papal legate in Lebanon, confirmed that there were no printing works in so far in the region. (Voyage au Mont- Liban, traduction française par Richard Simon, Paris, Louis Billaine, 1685, p.86; Reed. Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, 2005).] This pressure remained the only one for almost a century. Previously, the only printed books that were in circulation in Lebanon were the catechisms in Garschuni and the Arabic version of the Professio fidei Tridentina which were also drafted in Garschuni. The Jesuit Giovanni Battista Eliano[Giovanni Battista Eliano (1530-1589) was a converted Jew and grandson of Elia Levita, who had undertaken from 1578 to 1580 two mission trips to Lebanon.] had brought them from Rome in 1580. Another book with Maronite prayers had been printed in 1584 in Rome and in the following years created more prints in various Italian cities.Nasser Gemayel, «Les imprimeries libanaises de Rome», dans Camille Aboussouan (dir.), Le Livre et le Liban jusqu'à 1900, UNESCO, 1982, S. 190-193.] The Psalter of Quzhaya comprises 268 pages (without numbering eight, then 260 pages numbering in Syrian letters). The headers of the pages bear in red the Syrian tracks Ktobo d-mazmuré (Book of Psalms). There are 150 psalms and a canonical apocryphal, which obviously comes from the Syriac tradition, four biblical canticles and another of Ephrem the Syrian (only in Syriac). The texts are arranged on the sides in two columns, left and right in Syriac Garschuni. Since the Arabic text is longer, the characters have different sizes to obtain the parallelism. On the first page there is the signature of Sarkis (Sergius Risius Archiepiscopus Damascenus) with its coat of arms and the following information: \\"The revered hermitage of the Sacred Valley of Qozhaya in Mount Lebanon, work of the master Pasquale Eli and low Youssef ibn Amimeh de Karmsaddé called deacon, in 1610, of the Lord.\\" On the third page, the preface to the reader finds, written in Garschuni of Sarkis Rizzi. On page 258 is the imprimatur by the Bishop of Zgharta, Girgis Ibn Amira (probably in revenge no mention of Patriarch John Makhlouf). The last two pages are taken from the colophon, which is written in the first person of Deacon Youssef ibn Amimeh, who explains that he is through his mother the nephew of the initiator Sarkis Rizzi.[This is also his maternal grandfather, Gabriel, the brother of the patriarch Michael, Sarkis, and Moussa, the father of the Patriarch and Bishop Youssef Sarkis. He was ordained in 1644 as Metropolitan of Damascus.] He wishes to thank all employees of the company. The date of signature is precise: November 10, 1610. Sarkis was a master printer coming from Italy, and Pasquale Eli from Camerino who guided the work. But it is not known whether the Bishop during this year stayed even in Lebanon, or whether he was in Rome, and his nephew alone ran the company. Unknown is also the origin of the print types (two types in different sizes): they were also brought from Italy, or produced locally? They are known from no other issue. The filigree design speaks for the production in Italy. The issue has long been little known. Gabriel Sionita asserts (Syrian-Latin, Paris, 1625) in his preface to his bilingual Psalter that he had manufactured the first printed edition of this text in Syriac. The patriarch Estephan El Douaihy (1630-1704) mentioned the work in any of his numerous writings on the community and culture of the Maronites (dans ses nombreux écrits sur la communauté et la culture Maronites, ne jamais la mentionne). However, it is certain that this pressure has taken place in 1610. In the example that in the Nuremberg Municipal Library has been preserved in 1611 two piastres that were acquired by the Bishop of Zgharta by the scholar German Tobias Adami.[Tobias Adami (1581-1643), a pupil of Tommaso Campanella, a member of the Fruitbearing Society, which in 1611 made a trip to the Middle East.]Leo Allatius invokes in his Apes urbanae, sive de viris illustribus (Rome, 1633) on Sarkis Rizzi and confirms the issue. However, the first bibliography, which mentions the issue is the Bibliotheca Sacra of Jacques Lelong in 1709. Also known are a few examples: one each in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (A-495); in the Sainte-Geneviève Library (Fol A58 Inv 62 Res.);[The two French copies were purchased in the 17th century, Sainte-Geneviève, Jean Fronteau, librarian, 1648-1662] at the Nuremberg Library (Ms. Solg 21. 2); in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel (Bible-S 4 ° 227th); in Lebanon in the Bibliothèque orientale the Saint Joseph University (USJ-BO 26C2) and in the Bibliothèque centrale of the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Kaslik (USEK Pat. 291). Heritage There is no information on the whereabouts of the printing materials after production of the book. There was another attempt to set up a printing works in Lebanon (1627) and apparently was also the one that had been set up in Monastery of Qozhaya has already been lost. When the OLM's building was given back in 1708, there were no furnishings more and a printing house was set up again only at the beginning of the 19th century. After the one-time preparation of the printing of psalter in Quzhaya was only at the end of the 18th century into the Levant that was introduced again by the Melkite Patriarch Athanasius IV (1720-1724): he acquired a printing press from Bucharest and established in 1704 a printing house in Aleppo; some issues of biblical and liturgical texts appeared there from 1706 to 1711, before even this activity was canceled again. Only in 1733 was built permanently by a Melkite deacon, Abdallah Zakher, a print shop in the monastery of Dhour El Choueir.

She is a music educator who has served as the founder and director of the Accademia Superiore di Canto (Music Academy of Higher Education) in Verona, Italy, since 2004. Biography Karin Mensah was born on 8 March 1965 in Dakar, Senegal, in a community of expatriated Cape Verdeans. In 1975, she entered the School of Arts for Dance and Song in Dakar and began singing professionally in theater and on television from age 11. Her father was an influence on her, as he enjoyed classical music and though it was an unusual genre in Africa, she grew up listening to Beethoven and opera. After completion of her undergraduate education, she moved to Paris and studied at the University of Paris X-Nanterre, earning a degree in modern languages in 1988. She completed graduate work at the Orff Institute in Salzburg in a program offered in collaboration with the Società Italiana di Musica Elementare Orff-Schulwerk of Verona to learn educational methodology using the Orff approach. Simultaneously, she studied music theory at the Conservatorio Evaristo Felice Dall'Abaco (also known as the Conservatory of Verona) and singing under Rita Orlandi-Malaspina and G. Mastiff, graduating in 1991. Subsequently, she completed several singing courses including introductory singing at the Conservatorio Francesco Antonio Bonporti of Riva del Garda (1991), basic singing with Maestro Rossi Castellani at the of Padua (1993), and vocal technique with Niranjan Jhaveri at the Jazz-India Vocal Institute in Bombay (1998). Career After her completion of school, Mensah recorded several songs in various genres including blues, chanson, funk, jazz, Latin, and the traditional morna style of Cape Verde. Some of these early releases included Morna de Cabo Verde (Azzurra – 2000), La vie en rose ... et les plus grandes chansons françaises (Demetra – 2002), \\"Ayo\\" sung in Wolof in the collection Salsa Mundo, Cabo Verde (Azzurra – 2002), and Souvenirs de Paris (Brisa – 2005). She participated in the humanitarian project Capo Verde Terra D'Amore (Cape Verde Land of Love), which was a compilation of various artists in a series of five CDs, whose proceeds were donated to the World Food Programme (WFP). All of the artists involved in the project worked gratis so that the proceeds could go directly to African aid. Out of that project, Mensah created another album, Orizzonti, in which she sang the traditional Cape Verdean songs in Italian. In 2014, she released Lelio Swing based upon the music of Lelio Luttazzi. She worked with other Italian artists on the album, translating the French versions of songs, and adding Latin rhythms. Mensah also began teaching students and writing a book on music instruction. Her first book was called L'Arte di Cantare (The Art of Singing) and was published in 2001, to address gaps in education. Many of her students had studied for decades and felt that they had never learned proper breathing and other techniques, so she collected their concerns and created lessons in her book for students of modern music. In 2004, she founded and became the director of the Accademia Superiore di Canto in Verona, Italy. The school has a cooperative agreement with the Academy of Music of Verona so that students can earn teaching credentials. In addition to traditional music courses in a variety of genres, the school also offers work with a speech therapist to improve diction. Mensah recognized the importance of these types of interdisciplinary studies because she had to struggle with learning languages and technique when she emigrated from Africa. She served as part of the jury in the Channel 5 television program Friends of Maria de Filippi, which was a program searching for new singing talent. Around the same time, she expanded her previous book and published a new edition with a different publisher. The exposure created from the television show drove sales of the book and it reached the third most sold Italian teaching manuals in 2009. She created the Verona Pop Festival in 2012.

The is a yōkai which became widely known throughout Japan during the first half of the 19th century. Etymology The kanji for kudan is composed of two characters: , and . = \\"Like the Kudan\\" = Throughout Western Japan, the idiom began to appear on deeds and official documents. The phrase indicated that \\"As the prophecy [of the kudan] is always true, so too is the information in this document.\\" However, while the description of the kudan did not appear until the late Edo Period, the idiom \\"like the kudan\\" has been documented since the Heian period. It appears on page 128 of the early 11th century book The Pillow Book. For this reason, the relationship between the phrase \\"like the kudan\\" and the yōkai is considered an anachronistic one. Appearance Traditionally, the kudan is depicted as having the head of a human and the body of a bovine. Subsequent depictions have occasionally switched these elements and placed the head of a bovine onto the body of a human similar to a Minotaur. =Ushi-onna= During the period of post war reconstruction which followed World War II, another rumour similar to that of the kudan started to appear. Instead of a human-faced bovine, the creature spoken of was a kimono- wearing woman with a cow's face, referred to as . =Interpretation= The most widespread interpretation of the kudan comes from the Edo period, in which it is described as a creature which—despite being born from a cow—has the ability to use human speech. The creatures invariably die just a few short days after their birth, yet in that time they are said to coincide with some major event. Sometimes these events bring various misfortunes such as poor crop harvest, natural disasters, or sickness, only for the kudan to die when the event has come to pass. They are also said to issue prophecies of things to come. These prophecies typically depict bleak happenings such as war. A kudan was rumoured to have predicted Japan's defeat during World War II. Despite this, pictures and talismans of the kudan are still seen as good luck charms due to their association with honesty. Historical appearances=Pre-Meiji period= From the Edo period through Shōwa period, there have been several reported sightings throughout Japan, though they are most often reported in Western Japan. The earliest recorded appearance of the kudan comes in 1827 from Tateyama in Etchū Province (now part of Toyama Prefecture). Originally, the creature was referred to as . Pickers of wild plants came across a monster with a human face in the mountains calling itself \\"Kudabe\\". The creature predicted that \\"many would fall victim to an epidemic plague within the next few years. However, if a person were to carry and look upon a drawing of [the Kudabe], they would be spared\\". This then became something of a tradition, and amulets containing pictures of the Kudabe became very popular. Similarly, amulets containing pictures of the —an omen associated with cholera outbreaks—were believed to save people from cholera. The earliest pictorial example of a creature referred to as kudan was reported on an engraved tile in 1836. According to the tile, in \\"December 1836, in Tango province, a monster with the face of a human and the body of a cattle called \\"kudan\\" appeared on Kurahashi Mountain\\". The engraving also stated that \\"a kudan also appeared in December 1705, and a good harvest followed. Any who wore an amulet depicting the kudan experienced great family prosperity even in times of sickness, and large harvests in times of famine. Indeed, it is an auspicious beast! Because the kudan is an honest beast, it is customary to write \\"like the Kudan\\" at the end of every act and deed\\". At this time, the Tenpō famine was at its peak, and so it is believed that this report was intended to \\"give people hope of a good harvest\\". =Post-Meiji Restoration= On June 21, 1909, a Nagoya newspaper reported a sighting of the kudan. According to the article, a calf had been born with a human face a decade before in a farmhouse on the Gotō Islands. It reported that \\"It died only 31 days after its birth and prophesied a war between Japan and Russia.\\" The calf was later stuffed and put on display in the Yahiro Museum in Nagasaki. The museum has since closed and the calf's whereabouts are unknown. From the Meiji period to the early Shōwa period, objects referred to as \\"stuffed kudan\\" started to appear in \\"spectacle huts\\". In his book From Hoki to Oki, Lafcadio Hearn makes mention of these huts and travelling entertainers who would spread rumours of the kudan legend. According to this report, a travelling entertainer in 1892 brought a stuffed kudan aboard a ship bound for Mihonoseki. However, due to the unholy nature of the beast, the gods sent strong winds as punishment and the ship was unable to land at Mihonoseki. The theory about the kudan being a benevolent wish-granting creature subsided during the Shōwa period and was replaced by greater emphasis on the kudan's wartime prophecies. A kudan appeared in 1930 in a forest in Kagawa Prefecture, prophesying: \\"Soon, there will be a great war. You shall win, but you will later be struck down by plague. However, those who eat red beans and tie yarn around their wrists within three days of hearing this prophecy shall not fall sick.\\" In 1933, this rumor reached Nagano Prefecture and quickly spread, with elementary school students spreading it further by taking red bean rice into school for their lunches. However, the content of the rumor changed. Instead of a kudan, the prophecy was attributed to a snake-headed beast, sent by the deity of the Suwa Grand Shrine in Nagano Prefecture: Mishaguchi. During World War II, many rumors were spread about prophecies regarding the war and air raids. In 1943, a kudan was said to have been born in a geta shop in Iwakuni. This kudan predicted that \\"the war will end next year, around April or May.\\" It was then reported in the spring of 1945 in Matsuyama that \\"A Kudan has been born in Kobe. He says that 'anyone who consumes red beans or bean cakes within three days of hearing this tale shall escape the air raids.'\\" The rumors quickly circulated throughout Matsuyama.

The film was produced by independent Bulgarian producer Donka Angelova and co-produced by Stanev Films (Berlin) and Patrick Sandrin (Sofilm). It was presented at Sofia Film Fest 2010 and Cyprus International Film Festival 2012. The 2018 version of the film is presented by advanced coproducers Kathrin Brunner and Oliver Czeslik (mYndstorm productions), Berlin. Moon Lake has a nonlinear narrative structure and uses a leitmotiv technique with recurring themes and day dreams. It focuses not on suspense but on distorted contemplation. The film follows the parallel stories of two couples that represent the doomed lovers Orpheus and Eurydice of Greek mythology.  Synopsis  Moon Lake does not have a well-defined storyline, logically coherent cues or a straightforward message. The movie draws inspiration from the Greek Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. In the myth Orpheus travels to the Underworld to save his wife but in the end she is trapped forever. The movie follows two young lovers in an otherworldly marsh by an abandoned crude-oil carrier named \\"Moon Lake\\". They play a game about the Thracian singer Orpheus, who ascends from the Underworld, followed by his beloved mistress, Eurydice. Another nameless couple – a lookalike of Orpheus and Eurydice - appear. The trajectories of the two couples never cross. In an elite cave school in the rocky Black Sea coast, a cliff dwelling community is taught survival in a barren moonscape in the wake of the catastrophe. All of them live in an obsessive dream – to leave the Earth in a vessel, like Noah’s Ark, before the explosion of the Sun in four billion years.

The director Ivan Stanev spent a summer with the person who had been sent to dismantle the ship, filming daily. Some of the footage was later used in the film. This ship became the inspiration for a group of loosely related works, which also included a poem called Moon Lake written in German and a theatre performance in Norway in 2004. Moon Lake is part of Stanev’s strategy of making interconnected theater performances, film projects and literary texts, that he has also used for other projects such as ″Villa dei Misteri″ (2003) and ″Luxor Las Vegas″ (2006). Moon Lake was also inspired by the unique location where the movie was shot, the steep cliffs and caves in the Yalaita National Archaeological Reserve, south of Kamen Bryag, on the Black Sea. The script of the movie was only twelve pages long, and many of the scenes were improvised. It only features non-professional actors, the majority of whom were studying art and languages, and the others were musicians, painters or anarchists. The cast also included a group of professional teachers, specialists in subjects ranging from Ancient Greek to astrophysics. The languages spoken in Moon Lake include English, French, Russian, German, Spanish, Bulgarian, Ancient Greek, and Esperanto. The film was produced independently from national film centers. It was funded by producer Donka Angelova. It combines footage shot on 35 mm (all of the scenes including Orpheus and Eurydice), Super16mm (the scenes featuring the boy and girl in love), and HD with wide range of 35mm optics (all scenes shot in the caves). The postproduction was carried out by \\"The Post Republic\\" and done at Babelsberg Film Studio in Berlin using a complex color grading.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Sebastian Meissner. The film also features live music by Arabel von Karajan and Alarma Jazz Band, a string quartet performing \\"Der Tod und das Mädchen\\", the Orthodox choir \\"Sveta Troitza\\", and Romani music. The final sound design was provided by Matthias Schwab in the Babelsberg Studios, Berlin.  Critical reception  ULCC \\"Moon Lake\\", Dismantled The film received mostly positive reviews. Albena Stambolova wrote in Kultura \\"Although true, it is not enough to say that the film is beautiful. The film is very demanding of its spectators in a controlled manner, one that may put a strain on them. Words in different languages can be heard throughout the film – English, French, Greek, etc. Expressing both poetical and philosophical ideas, it is not enough to understand these words. But rather, they seem to have been let loose into the free space under the vault of the sky where they soar freely and occasionally return to those who uttered them. Distilled to the world’s extremes, Moon Lake works with earth, water, sky (air), wood, and metal – it operates with the elements from which, according to the Chinese, the world was created.

The previous school name was École Nationale de l'Industrie Minérale (or National School of the Mineral Industry in English). Based in Rabat, Mines Rabat is one of the oldest engineering schools in Morocco. Mines Rabat is a member of the Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE). The course for the engineering program lasts three years and the admission is done mainly by the common national competition (CNC) after making two or three years in preparatory classes. Despite its small size (fewer than 300 students are accepted each year, after a very selective exam), it is a crucial part of the infrastructure of Moroccan industry. The Mines Rabat is often compared at the Mines ParisTech in France. In the limit of available places candidates can be admitted to this title and by level: * Bachelor / CUES or equivalent * New License * Master of Science and Technology and bachelor * Master science or technique. Admissions The admission to Mines Rabat in the normal cycle is made through a very selective entrance examination, and requires at least two years of preparation after high school in preparatory classes. Admission includes a week of written examinations during the spring followed sometimes by oral examinations over the summer.  Rankings  Mines Rabat is ranked among the top 3 Moroccan Grandes Ecoles, though it doesn't appear in international rankings due to its very limited number of students (300 students for the class of 2016). History The school was established in 1972 and now about 300 Moroccan students are admitted each year. Foreign students, having followed a classe préparatoire curriculum (generally, African students) can also enter through the same competitive exam. Finally, some foreign students come for a single year from other top institutions in Africa. The Diplôme d'Ingénieur Grandes Écoles of Engineering usually offer several master's degree programs, the most important of which is the Diplôme d'Ingénieur (Engineer's Degree), the Moroccan/French master's degree in Engineering. Because of the strong selection of the students and of the very high quality of the curriculum, the Diplôme d'Ingénieur (which can be equivalent to a Master of Science in Engineering) gives right to bear the title of an Ingénieur, is one of the most prestigious degrees in Morocco; it is protected by law and submitted to strict government supervision. It is more valued by companies than a university degree in terms of career opportunities and wages. Preparatory classes: The classic admission path into Grandes Écoles To enter the Diplôme d'Ingénieur curriculum of Grandes Écoles, students traditionally have to complete the first two years of their curriculum in the very intensive preparatory classes, most often in an institution outside the Grande École. At the end of these preparatory classes, the students take nationwide, extremely selective competitive exams for entrance into Grandes Écoles, where they complete their curriculum for three years. Thus the 1st year of the Diplôme d'Ingénieur curriculum in Grandes Écoles corresponds to a senior undergraduate year, and the two final years correspond to the graduate part of the curriculum: 1st year at Mines Rabat - equivalent to - senior year of BSc. 2nd year at Mines Rabat - equivalent to - 1st year of MSc. 3rd (final) year at Mines Rabat - equivalent to - 2nd year of MSc. Options and majors The Mines Rabat has a total of 15 engineering options: * Process Engineering (IP) * Energy Engineering (GE) * Operations Planning Protection of Soil and Basement (AEPSSS (Mines)) * Environment and Industrial Safety (ESI) * Computer Engineering (GI) * Production Systems (PS) * Electromechanical (ELM) * Industrial Maintenance (MI) * Industrial Management (MGI) * Materials and Quality Control (MCQ) * Hydro-Geotechnical Engineering (HG) * Renewable energy (RE) International Agreements signed with: * France: ** Central Group of Schools (École Centrale Paris, École Centrale de Lyon, École Centrale de Marseille, École Centrale de Casablanca ... ) ** Groupe des écoles des mines (GEM) (Mines ParisTech, Mines Saint- Étienne (ENSM SE), Mines Nancy, École des mines d'Alès, École des mines de Nantes, ... ) ** National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine (INPL) ** École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques (ENSMM) ** Aix Marseille University ** University of Technology of Compiègne (UTC) ** INSA Lyon * Belgium: **Faculté polytechnique de Mons **Louvain School of Engineering, University of Louvain (UCLouvain) * Switzerland: **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) * Canada: ** Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal ** Laval University * United States: **Georgia Institute of Technology **Colorado School of Mines **South Dakota School of Mines and Technology * Tunisia: ** National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT) External links * Official website * Mines Rabat on fr.wikipedia.org * CGE * Institut Mines-Télécom * \\"Grandes Ecoles\\" organisation scheme vs. the classic university scheme * Rankig Web of Universities * French-English translation for resume Category:Education in Morocco ","title":"École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Rabat"},{"id":"49179385","text":"Colonel Fahmi Said () was one of the Four Colonels of the Golden Square, a pro-Nazi cabal that briefly overthrew the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq in 1941.

Terminology Alternative terms for this condition include ithyphallophobia or medorthophobia. An individual who has the condition is a phallophobe. The term is derived from the word phallo in Greek meaning penis and at times denoting masculinity, coupled with the suffix phobia. Medomalacuphobia, the fear of losing an erection or acquiring erectile dysfunction, is its antonym. At its most extreme, phallophobia when coupled with a psychiatric condition may result in issues such as Klingsor Syndrome or ederacinism.Schweitzer, Isaac. \\"Genital self-amputation and the Klingsor syndrome.\\" Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry 24.4 (1990): 566-569 Scope In its broadest sense the term can be used metaphorically, for example in regards to pro-feminists. However, in its narrower sense it has been described as a symptom that is more likely to be exhibited by women. In sources that appear to use it in the original sense, it is sometimes nuanced as a byproduct or hyponym of an aversion, dislike or fear of the protruding appendage resemblance of the male erection, and how this symbolizes an accompanying aggression or assertiveness. This may occur in an aesthetic setting, or in a sociological setting. Such an aversion is sometimes extended to an unattributale cognitive process while at other times men's self and own experience. In such a scenario, due to the essentiality of such reflexes for men, some correspondents have posited the feasibility of such a diagnosis if a man has relatively frequent nocturnal penile tumescence since he will probably not notice his erections then. In cultures that discuss the male genitalia as a singular unit, the phenomenon of castration anxiety may overlap with phallophobia from a linguistic standpoint. Although usually referring to ordinary erections, the term has also been used in toxicological and therapeutic contexts. Cause Sigmund Freud has footnoted the possibility that this fear may be derived from a lack of ingenuity allowing one to ornamentally distance the copulatory organs from the excretory organs. Such a condition can affect both men and women. For others, symptoms include what characterizes a panic attack. It does not necessarily have to be induced by an uncovered penis, but may also result from seeing the manbulging outline or curvature of the penis, perhaps through clothes consisting of thin fabric. In more extreme cases it has been likened to the fight or flight response ingrained within the human body wherein an individual ceases to be intimate with their male partner and is unable to visit mixed gender establishments where people are likely to wear more revealing clothing, such as a gym, beach, cinema or livingrooms with a switched on monitor. The fear can recur through any of the senses including accidental touch, sight, hearing the word penis or thinking about an erection. The phobia may have developed from a condition such as dyspareunia,Reamy, Kenneth J. \\"Meeting Sexual Dysfunction Again for the First Time.\\" Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy 27.2 (2001): 197-201. a trauma (usually sexual) that occurred during childhood, but can also have a fortuitous origin. In literature covering human sexuality, it is used as an adjective only to negatively allude to penetrative sex acts. Men who have the phobia may try to avoid wearing sweatpants and other light fabrics, especially in public. Some analysts have purported that the condition may be inherited or may be a combination of genetic inheritance and life experiences. For men with the condition, one of the byproducts is difficulty consummating with a partner due to a sense of vulnerability. This vulnerability may have developed during childhood because they grew up being told by their parents that sex and its physiological functions were evil, sinful and dirty, but were subsequently unable to detach such shameful feelings nor reverse it upon reaching adulthood, even when romantic initiatives were subsequently approved of or encouraged by their parents. Behavior Sometimes the word is used in a sense wherein it is metaphorical and unrelated to its etymological origins, as in for instance when a man sees another man as a rival and a potential source of infidelity for his spouse. Other reviews have applied the term as a euphemism or allegory to indicate that society is in contemporary times less willing to be objective and straightforward in discussions of the physiological aspects of the young male body in general due to prudery, or a celibacist and puritan standpoint that in particular targets men and boys. For instance, Ken Corbett has theorized the fact of widespread absence of the penis as an object of discussion in children's books and parenting books as evidencing that \\"a kind of phallophobia has crept into our cultural theorizing\\". In other writings it has been used as an epithet to describe the lesbian or female asexual aversion to male sexuality. Author Fawzi Boubia defines phallophobia as a hostility towards the stronger male gender. The term has also been used as a substitute to indirectly express an aversion to procreation. Phallophobia has also been used as an algorithm in studies of heuristics in robotic decision making in themes related to sexual temperance. In criticisms of anti-male sexism, phallophobia is used as an epithet to deride double standards and hypocrisy in the legal system, all down to the set of genitalia one possesses. One of the byproducts of this phobia among women is that it may result in them faking an orgasm to mask their feeling of revulsion around their male spouse. Forms of treatment may include intensive counselling and therapy sessions.

Taxonomy It was first described by Italian botanist Giovanni Passerini in 1872 as Hydnum joeides. Frédéric Bataille transferred it to the genus Sarcodon in 1924. Description The fungus makes fruit bodies with flattened to concave caps measuring in diameter. They initially have a velvety surface texture that later breaks up into reddish-brown scales. The crowded spines on the cap underside are up to 3 mm long, and are decurrent on the stipe. Initially pale pink, they become brownish in age. Spores are tuberculate (covered in warts), and measure 6.3–7.2 by 4–4.7 µm. It is reportedly inedible. Habitat and distribution The fungus is found in western and central Europe, where it is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), English oak (Quercus robur), and probably sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is on the red lists of several countries: Flandres, France and Norway (critically endangered); The Netherlands, Germany, Lower Saxony and Switzerland (endangered); and Sweden (vulnerable). Because of the continued decline in sightings in Europe, it has been proposed for inclusion on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The species has also been reported from the United States, and New Zealand, although mycologist Eef Arnolds regards these records as doubtful because of discrepancies in the reported sizes of the spores.

It tells the fictional story of a traveling Jewish businessman who is looking for a minyan for Shabbat in the small Jewish community of Mobile, Alabama, and serves as the tenth man for a group of nine Jews. The song was popularized as a pop ballad by Lenny Solomon of Shlock Rock in 1987. In 2015, Solomon recorded an a cappella version with The Maccabeats. Two music videos have been produced. Background The term minyan man refers to the tenth man who completes a Jewish prayer quorum; with less than ten men present, the congregation would not be permitted to recite Kaddish, read from the Torah, or perform other parts of the public prayer service. According to Jewish law, not all ten need be actively praying; as long as a majority of six men are actively engaged in prayer, the other four may stand by and answer amen to the others' blessings. Traditionally, synagogues in small communities paid a small stipend to a \\"minyan man\\"—typically a poor person or an older individual subsisting on public welfare—whose job it was to attend all weekday, Shabbat, and holiday services in order to guarantee a quorum for public prayer. The \\"minyan man\\" was especially important to insure a minyan for non-regular worshippers who came to synagogue services once a year on the yahrtzeit (anniversary of death) of their deceased parent in order to recite the Mourner's Kaddish. Recording history In November 1986, composer Victor Shine sent a cassette recording of his original song \\"Minyan Man\\" to Lenny Solomon of Shlock Rock. Solomon re- arranged it as a pop ballad and recorded it on the band's 1987 album Jewish Pride, released four months later. Noted Jewish musician Gershon Veroba sang the lead vocals on the track. Shlock Rock considers \\"Minyan Man\\" one of their top five all-time hits. The song entered Jewish popular culture as a kumzits and campfire song. In 2015, Solomon recorded an a cappella version of \\"Minyan Man\\" with The Maccabeats. He released this version on Shlock Rock's 2015 album Shlockapella. \\"Minyan Man\\" was also covered by Yidcore, an Australian Jewish punk rock band. Music videos The original video for \\"Minyan Man\\" was produced, directed, and filmed by Phillip S. Schiller in 1989. Outdoor scenes of Solomon driving through a town (identified as Mobile, Alabama, in the song) by bus and meeting a rabbi on the street were filmed in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Indoor scenes of a minyan praying in the back of a hardware store were filmed in Birmingham, Alabama, and featured elderly members of Knesseth Israel Congregation of Birmingham. The video was released on Shlock Rock Videos – Volume 1 in November 1990. A new music video featuring an a cappella version of the song, sung by Solomon and members of The Maccabeats, was recorded at the historic Stanton Street Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City, in March 2015. Black and white scenes of Solomon and the minyan members from the 1989 video were intercut into the new video, which was produced and filmed by Uri Westrich.

It is situated just north of the city centre, across from Copenhagen's largest park, Fælledparken, and between the Østerbro and Nørrebro districts. It is home to the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. Overview The Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences (KUB Nord), as seen across Tagensvej from the south The North Campus is home to two of the University of Copenhagen's six faculties: the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. The Faculty of Science's main area is University Park (Universitetsparken), a triangle-shaped area located between Jagtvej, Tagensvej and Nørre Allé. A street divides the area into northern and southern sections. Most of the buildings in the area's northern section are used by the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences' School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, while most of the buildings in the southern section are used by the Faculty of Science. The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences' main area is the Panum Building, which is located south of the University Park and across the street from Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University Hospital). It is the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences' largest building complex and houses six of the Faculty’s thirteen departments. Between the Panum building complex and the University Park is the Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences (KUB Nord), which is part of the Royal Library and shared by both faculties. The North Campus also has satellite buildings, such as the Teilum Building, the Niels Bohr Institute, and the Medical Museion. University Park The University Park (Universitetsparken) is a triangle-shaped area located in Nørrebro that is bordered by Jagtvej, Tagensvej and Nørre Allé. The area has been subject to the state since 1898 and contains a large number of buildings associated with the University of Copenhagen and Rigshospitalet. The area forms a central part of the North Campus and will therefore be subject to a number of changes until 2020. The University Park is bisected by Lersø Parkallé. The part of Lersø Parkallé between Jagtvej and Nørre Allé is named Universitetsparken, thus creating addresses with that street name and dividing the University Park into northern and southern sections. =History= Franz Maria Šedivý: The Planned University Park, 1939 The area is historically part of Serridslev, which in 1525/1527 was given by the King and the bishop of Roskilde to Copenhagen and became Nørre Fælled. The part of Nørre Fælled which today constitutes University Park was given to the state by Copenhagen in an 1898 agreement. The agreement also dealt with the Rigshospitalet and Østerfælled Barracks areas. The first settlement in the area was the Copenhagen Military Hospital (Københavns Militærhospital) along today's Tagensvej, in an area that extended from Jagtvej to Refnæsgade. The vision for the University Park area was the brainchild of architect Kaj Gottlob in 1930, with buildings along Nørre Allé and Jagtvej encircling a central green area. =Selected buildings= The Green Lighthouse Buildings that are located within the University Park area include the Zoological Museum, the Green Lighthouse,http://greenlighthouse.ku.dk/english the August Krogh Building, the Hans Christian Ørsted Building, the Copenhagen Biocenter, and the Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences (KUB Nord). Buildings that are also located within North Campus, but are not part of the University of Copenhagen, include the Copenhagen Bio Science Park (COBIS), Metropolitan University College, Rigshospitalets Kollegium, and Egmont H. Petersens Kollegium. August Krogh Building The August Krogh Building The August Krogh Building (formerly referred to as the August Krogh Institute) is a building that is used by the Department of Biology.http://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/about/premises/ It is named after August Krogh (1874–1949), who contributed a number of fundamental discoveries within several fields of physiology, and is famous for developing the Krogh Principle. The building is located near the Department of Computer Science. Hans Christian Ørsted Building Buildings D, C and B (left to right) of the H. C. Ørsted Building, as seen from Nørre Allé Building E of the H. C. Ørsted Building, which holds the Department of Mathematical Sciences The Hans Christian Ørsted Building (informally abbreviated HCØ and formerly named the Hans Christian Ørsted Institute) is a building complex that houses the departments of mathematics and chemistry, as well as part of the Niels Bohr Institute. It is named after the physicist Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), who discovered electromagnetism (1820) and was the first to isolate aluminium (1825). The complex is made up of five connected buildings: A, B, C, D and E. Building A is a long connecting building, it has ground, first floor and basement level and holds the auditoria. Building B is a five floor building, and holds facilities for inorganic (ground, first and second level) and organic chemistry (3rd, fourth and fifth level). In the basement of the building is a mass spectrometry apparatus. Building C is a five floor building similar to building B and holds the sections for theoretical chemistry and spectroscopy. Building D is a five floor building similar to B and C, but this is dedicated to physics and is as such part of the Niels Bohr Institute. It holds the Ørsted Laboratory. Building E is another type building, not as large as the other three. It holds the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Panum Building The Panum Building, as seen across the Blegdamsvej-Tagensvej intersection from the east The Panum Building (formerly referred to as the Panum Institute) is the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences' largest building complex and houses six of the Faculty’s thirteen departments. Panum contains the Faculty's shared administration and building services offices as well as a library, two canteens, lecture halls, classrooms, study rooms, laboratories, student clubs, a bookshop, and part of the Animal Research Unit. The Panum Building also houses the largest dental clinic in Denmark with approximately 230 treatment chairs. The building was named after Danish physiologist Peter Ludvig Panum (1820–1885). The Panum Building was built from 1971–1986 by the architects Eva and Nils Koppel, Gert Edstrand, Poul Erik Thyrring and reflects Brutalism. The outside areas were designed by landscape architects Edith and Ole Nørgård. The artistic decoration and color schemes – e.g. the characteristic chimneys – were envisioned by Tonning Rasmussen. In parts of the basement, there are murals made by Poul Gernes. The Panum complex was first taken into use in 1975. The School of Oral Health Care moved to Panum in 1986.http://skt.ku.dk/english/schooloforalhealthcare/panum/ Satellite buildings In addition to the North Campus, satellite buildings include the Teilum Building, which is located between Rigshospitalet and Fælledparken; the Niels Bohr Institute, which is located between Rigshospitalet and the headquarters of the Danish Order of Freemasons; and the Medical Museion, which is located near Amalienborg in central Copenhagen.http://cas.ku.dk/english/map/nc_box/North_Campus_2015.pdf Departments and institutes Departments and institutes that are located at the North Campus: *Faculty of Science **Department of Biology: Located at the Copenhagen Biocenter, August Krogh Building, and Universitetsparken 15. **Department of Chemistry: Located at the University Park.http://chem.ku.dk/om/ **Department of Computer Science: Located at the University Park. **Department of Mathematical Sciences: Located at the University Park. **Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports: Located at the University Park and at the Frederiksberg Campus.http://nexs.ku.dk/english/about/ **Niels Bohr Institute: Located at Blegdamsvej 17.

Although categorized as a compilation album, it consists only of previously unreleased material, with alternate versions of Ayreon songs with different singers, demos, and of the song \\"Cold Metal\\" from Lucassen's then-upcoming project Ambeon. The album's name comes from the fact that, according to Lucassen, it is \\"intended primarily for die-hard Ayreon fans\\". It is notable for featuring vocals by Ian Parry and Leon Goewie, two former bandmates of Lucassen on his former band Vengeance.  Production  The songs contained in the album are for the most part either demos or re-recordings of older Ayreon songs. \\"Into the Black Hole\\", \\"Out of the White Hole\\" and 'Through the Wormhole\\" are three songs from Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator. For the first song, Lucassen wanted Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden; however due to Dickinson's busy schedule, it was unsure until the very last moment whether or not if he could come to Lucassen's studio and record it. As Damian Wilson came into Lucassen's studio to provide vocals in \\"And the Druids Turn to Stone\\" for Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, Lucassen had the idea of recording a version of \\"Into the Black Hole\\" with Wilson, in case Dickinson would turn out to be unavailable. Dickinson was featured on the album version of the song, while the version present on Ayreonauts Only is the one with Wilson, and still features Lana Lane's backing vocals. For two other songs, Lucassen asked his friends Robert Soeterboek and Ian Parry (who had previously sung for him in Ayreon and Vengeance respectively) to provide guide vocals for the song's actual singers, respectively Timo Kotipelto and Fabio Lione; those guide vocals are the ones used in Ayreonauts Only. \\"Carpe Diem\\" is 1992 demo by Lucassen's short-lived band Plant Nine (soon renamed Planet Nine and disbanded), with Robert Soeterboek on vocals, Peter Vink (who would later be a member of Lucassen's project Star One) on bass, and Cleem Determeyer on keyboards. Due to a dysfunctioning tape recorder, Lucassen had to play all guitar parts in one take, and used a drum machine. He eventually used the song as the basis of \\"Chaos\\", the opening track of Flight of the Migrator, with this time real drums played by Ed Warby. Another song from that album, \\"the New Migrator\\", was originally composed by Lucassen and Parry (from Vengeance) during that time.Interview with Arjen: Aardschok Magazine (pt. 2) \\"Temple of the Cat\\" is the only single released from the album The Dream Sequencer, however Lucassen always felt unsatisfied with the final result. The version on this album is a newly recorded version, featuring Astrid van der Veen of his newly created band Ambeon. Lucassen stated \\"in my opinion this acoustic version is even better than the original. This is the way I wanted this song to sound.\\" On the album Into the Electric Castle, the parts of the character Hippie were originally sung by the singer Mouse, but due to \\"unforeseen problems\\", his vocals were not used and Lucassen had to sing the part himself. \\"Original Hippie's Amazing Trip\\" is a medley of the parts sung by the character, but as sung by Mouse. The voice of Anneke van Giersbergen from the original version is also present. \\"Beyond the Last Horizon\\" is a newly, \\"more guitar-orientated new version with a real drummer\\" of the song of the same name from Actual Fantasy, featuring Gary Hughes of Ten on vocals. All the parts were re-recorded, except the guitar and synthesizer solo. \\"The Charm of the Seer\\", Eyes of Time\\", and \\"Nature's Dance\\" are previously unreleased demo versions of the eponymous song from The Final Experiment, with different singers: The first and third songs feature Lucassen, and the second features Leon Goewie (former member of Vengeance with Lucassen and Parry).

Early in her career the figure studies, landscapes, and still lifes she painted drew praise for their \\"purity and clarity of color,\\" \\"sound draftsmanship,\\" and \\"individual choice of subject and its handling.\\" During the 1930s she was known mainly for the quality of her still life paintings which showed, one critic said, \\"impeccable artistry.\\" At the end of her career, in the 1960s and 1970s, she produced specialized and highly disciplined still lifes of objects such as dead leaves and pieces of crumpled paper, which, said a critic, approached a \\"magical realism.\\" As an art activist she helped promote the rights of artists for fair remuneration. Art training In 1912, at the age of 13, Schmidt began to take Saturday classes at the Art Students League under the artist Agnes Richmond. At that time the League was popular with girls and young women who wished to study art and its Saturday classes made it accessible to those, like Schmidt, who were attending school on weekdays. While still in high school she, her sister, and two other girls spent part of one summer painting at the art colony in Woodstock, New York. With her sister and another girl she spent the next two summer vacations painting in Gloucester, Massachusetts, then a popular destination for artists. During these trips Agnes Richmond acted as chaperon and guardian. In 1917 after graduating from high school Schmidt took regular afternoon classes at the League. By chance she joined the class of Kenneth Hayes Miller, the artist who would most influence her mature style. Schmidt found Miller's teaching style to be emotionally and intellectually demanding. She said that in addition to teaching technique Miller helped each student bring out his or her unique talents and as a result, she said, \\"all of us were enormously different\\" in manner of working and artistic style. By giving them group assignments and inviting them to regular Wednesday afternoon teas at his apartment Miller also helped his students become well acquainted with one another. During the time she was his student the League abolished its same-sex classroom policy and, mixing more freely with men than she had previously been able to do, Schmidt broadened her circle of friends. To a group of women she had previously befriended she now added a roughly equal number of men. Over the next few decades this group of students would form the nucleus of three others: (1) the \\"Fourteenth Street school\\" or \\"Miller gang\\" made up of Miller students who rented apartments in the vicinity of his apartment at 30 E. 14th Street, (2) the \\"Whitney Circle\\" all of whom were members of the Whitney Studio Club, and (3) the artists attached to two galleries, the Daniel Gallery and, after its demise, the Downtown Gallery. In 1932 Peggy Bacon produced a drypoint print showing the group enjoying themselves at a Third Avenue bowling alley. Entitled \\"Ardent Bowlers,\\" it showed Alexander Brook, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Reginald Marsh, along with Peggy herself and others of Schmidt's friends. In an oral history interview of 1969 Schmidt named many of the ardent bowlers as her lifelong friends. Artistic career Schmidt became founding member of Whitney Studio Club in 1918. The club welcomed talented young artists such as Schmidt and her friends from the Miller class. Proponents of all artistic styles were welcome and the membership grew quickly as members proposed other artists for membership. In addition to holding group shows, the club held solo exhibitions in separate galleries for two or three members at a time. These exhibitions drew favorable reviews from New York critics thus helping Schmidt and the club's other young members, especially the women among them, to advance their careers. Schmidt later recalled that the young League students in the club were among the first League artists of her time to be given exhibitions. In 1919 Schmidt married fellow student Yasuo Kuniyoshi at an artist compound that had been established by Hamilton Easter Field in Ogunquit, Maine. As a patron of young artists, Field had recognized Kuniyoshi's talent and had invited him to spend summers in Ogunquit beginning in 1918. Schmidt met Field through Kuniyoshi and was herself invited to attend. As a wedding present Field gave them the use of a studio in the compound and also gave them an apartment in one of two houses he owned in Brooklyn's Columbia Heights. =1920s= Katherine Schmidt, Drawing of Yasuo Kuniyoshi, n.d., graphite on paper, 12½ x 15½ in. (31.8 X 39.4 cm.) Although both Schmidt and Kuniyoshi were able to sell a few paintings in the early 1920s, they had to take jobs both to support themselves and to save for a planned trip to Europe. Schmidt ran the lunch room at the League during this time and later ran an evening sketch class and performed odd jobs for the Whitney Studio Club. Schmidt and Kuniyoshi spent two years in Europe during 1925 and 1926 and returned there in 1927. Unlike Kuniyoshi and other American artists who traveled in France, Spain, and Italy during the 1920s, Schmidt did not find in those places subjects that she wished to paint and she returned to the United States feeling that the American environment suited her artistic outlook better than the European. The Whitney Studio Club had given Schmidt her first solo exhibition in 1923. She and two other artists showed works in three separate galleries. In 1927 Schmidt was given her second solo show, the first of an annual series of them held at the Daniel Gallery. By this time Schmidt's work had become familiar to both critics and gallery goers. Earlier shows at the Whitney Studio Club, the Society of Independent Artists, and a few other galleries had attracted notice from New York art critics, but these reviews were not nearly as comprehensive as the write ups her work received at this time. A critic for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Helen Appleton Read, said her work during the early years of her career had showed Kenneth Hayes Miller's influence but was nonetheless \\"distinctly personal.\\" The paintings in the solo show at the Daniel Gallery were now, she said, less given to Miller- like subjects than they had been. A critic for the New York Times noted an influence of Renoir in the figure studies and praised her ability to capture a sense of drama in her subjects but felt, overall, that her work lacked feeling, was \\"somewhat dry in aspect.\\" In reviewing the solo show given her a year later a Brooklyn Daily Eagle critic noticed a continuing improvement in her work. This critic saw little influence of Miller's naïve style, a continuing feeling for texture and color, and, in general, and increasing competency in her work. Writing about the same show Margaret Bruening of the New York Evening Post mentioned lingering traces of \\"Kenneth Hayes Millerism,\\" praised Schmidt's self-portrait as \\"a likeness and a good piece of plastic design carried out in reticence and surety,\\" and said that she \\"seems to grow quite steadily and triumphantly into her own.\\" One painting, called \\"Still Life\\" was to Breuning the highlight of the exhibition. \\"A real joy to behold,\\" it was, she said, a work of \\"power and beauty\\" having \\"aesthetic emotion\\" that was lacking in Schmidt's landscapes and figure paintings. The tendency to see increasing strength and maturity in Schmidt's work continued in reviews of her solo show at the Daniel Gallery in 1930 of which one critic pointed to a \\"a rich and natural realization of her gifts\\" and said \\"she is now reaping the artistic reward for this strenuous apprenticeship, in a power and concentration that the more easily satisfied painter does not attain.\\" =1930s= Katherine Schmidt, \\"Tiger, Tiger,\\" 1933, oil on canvas, 30 x 25 in. (76.2 X 63.5 cm.) Katherine Schmidt, \\"Broe and McDonald Listen In,\\" 1937, oil on canvas, 30 x 24 in. (76.2 x 60.96 cm.) Schmidt held her last solo show at the Daniel Gallery in 1931. By then she was seen as primarily a still life painter. One critic found the still lifes in the show to be technically sound but lacking in \\"soul.\\" Finding in them a \\"substantial fund of humor,\\" another said they showed an \\"uncanny skill in surrounding three-dimensional forms with air\\" and possessed a \\"mysterious realism.\\" A third critic, Breuning in the Evening Post, saw in them an \\"astonishing vitality.\\" In 1932 the new Whitney Museum of American Art showed one of Schmidt's paintings in a group exhibition and the following year the museum purchased it. Schmidt began showing at the Downtown Gallery in 1933, following the closure of the Daniel Gallery the year before. Of her first solo show at the Downtown Gallery in 1934, Edward Alden Jewell of the New York Times said she showed a lingering influence of both Miller and Renoir in some figure studies but added \\"it never does to pigeonhole Katherine Schmidt's art with too much easy confidence.\\" He called her painting, \\"Tiger, Tiger,\\" humorous, exotic, and, in all, the best work she had done in a long time. Noting her skillful handling of portraits, figure studies, landscapes, and still lifes, he added, \\"Katherine Schmidt may well be styled the Ruth Draper of the art world.\\" Writing that \\"she has by no means attained the position as one of the foremost painters of the younger generation that she deserves,\\" a critic for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle called this show \\"one of the outstanding exhibitions of the year.\\" Schmidt continued to receive thoughtful reviews of both solo and group shows held at the Downtown Gallery, the Whitney Museum, and other venues in the middle and late 1930s. Fellow artist, friend, art historian, curator, and critic, Lloyd Goodrich said that Schmidt's technical command increased during the early 1930s and this command was most apparent in her still life work: \\"Every object was modeled with a complete roundness and a sensation of solidity and weight... The relations of each element to the others, and to the space in which they were contained, were clearly understood. The result was finely conceived, closely knit design. Color was full-bodied, earthy, neither sweet nor brilliant.\\" At this time she began to make figure studies of the Depression's victims and for portraying these subjects Edward Alden Jewell wrote that she was \\"the right artist for the right task.\\" Describing the paintings in a 1939 solo show at the Downtown as \\"delightfully congruous,\\" he said they revealed \\"a charming, subtle style that has ripened and that has real stature.\\" Goodrich described one of these figure studies, \\"Broe and McDonald Listen In,\\" as different from \\"the idealized pictures of the proletariat common at the time\\" and said \\"every element\\" of the painting \\"played its part as form, even Broe's shirtsleeves, whose folds were as consciously designed as the draperies in old masters.\\" =1940s, 1950s, and 1960s= Katherine Schmidt, \\"Blue Paper and Cracker Boxes,\\" 1958, oil on canvas, 24 x 32¼ in. (61 X 82 cm.) After 1939 Schmidt produced less work and although she appeared in group shows she gave no further solo exhibitions until 1961. During the war years she produced an atypical painting, \\"Home,\\" evoking patriotic sentiments. Noting that it was a marked departure from the aesthetic distance she had previously maintained, a critic called this work \\"almost religious.\\" Toward the end of the 1930s Schmidt had begun to feel dissatisfied with her work in general and particularly with her technique. To solve the problem she returned to fundamentals. Using a German text that her husband translated for her, she slowly rebuilt her skills over the next two decades. The book was Max Doerner's Malmaterial und seine Verwendung im Bilde. She said: \\"The reading of the Doerner book was very important personally to me. It took me years to understand the technique really, I mean the meaning of it.\\" Doerner called for a disciplined approach to painting. Deploring what he saw as a modern tendency for artists to use a \\"free and easy technique untrammeled by any regard for the laws of the materials,\\" he called for \\"systematically constructed pictures\\" produced by \\"clearly thought-out pictorial projects, where every phase of the picture is developed almost according to a schedule.\\" In 1960 she found a new focus for her art. Capitalizing on the strength she had previously shown in still lifes and employing the disciplines she learned from Doerner, she began to use a naturalistic approach which, as one critic said, approached a \\"magical realism.\\" Her decision to work in a new style was sudden. She said: \\"One day I washed my hands. My waste basket wasn't right there so I threw the paper towel down on the table. Later when I went back into this little room I had in the country, there was this piece of paper lying there. I thought, \\"Oh, my, that's beautiful.\\" And I painted it.\\" Her new work was precise and realistic almost to the point of trompe-l'œil. Her subjects were ordinary objects of no obvious beauty, crumpled paper and dead leaves. Using what one critic called a \\"neat and painstaking draftsmanship,\\" she made pictures which one critic found to contain \\"an almost pre-Raphaelite intensity.\\" Her method was slow and methodical. She built up each painting systematically over as many as five months. As a result, it took her a long time to accumulate enough new work for a gallery exhibition. She had used objects such as these in some of her earlier still lifes but never as the main element of a painting. Lloyd Goodrich said that in paintings like \\"Blue Paper and Cracker Boxes\\" Schmidt was able to give \\"movement and life\\" to the \\"unsubstantial, immobile\\" objects she painted and concluded that her paintings at this time \\"within their severely limited content, achieved the purest artistry of all her works.\\" Schmidt respected and admired the work of abstract and non-objective artists, but she never felt inclined to work in that style. In 1969 she said > I never have liked to work from my imagination. I like to work from a fact, > and I will try to make something out of the fact. I enjoy that most. And I > do my best work when I do that. I don't know whether it's just because I put > it out of my mind that I don't like to make things up. Some artists are > marvelous at just fantastic inventions. But I love the smell and the feel of > life. You have to follow your appetites. You don't choose to be what you > are. You are what you are. During the 1960s and 1970s Schmidt showed at the Isaacson, Zabriskie, and Durlacher Galleries, in exhibitions that appeared, as she said, pretty much as she pleased. During the 1970s her output diminished up to her death in 1978. Exhibitions Schmidt's work appeared most frequently in group and solo shows held in the early 1920s by the Whitney Studio Club, in the later 1920s by the Daniel Gallery, in the 1930s by the Downtown Gallery and the Whitney Museum of American Art, and in the 1960s and 1970s by the Isaacson and Durlacher Galleries. In addition to these shows, Schmidt's work appeared in group exhibitions at A.W.A. Clubhouse, An American Group, Inc., Art Students League, Associated American Artists, Brooklyn Society of Modern Artists, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Penn., Corcoran Gallery, Washington, D.C., Grand Central Galleries, J. Wanamaker Gallery of Modern Decorative Art, New York World's Fair, 1939, Newark Museum, Newark, N.J., Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Penn., Pepsi Cola Portrait of America Exhibit, Society of Independent Artists, and Salons of America. She appeared in solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, Newark Museum, University of Nebraska, and Zabriskie Gallery. Collections Schmidt's work has been widely collected American museums, including the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, Newark Museum (Newark, N.J.), Santa Barbara Museum (Santa Barbara, Cal.), Sata Roby Foundation Collection, Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington, D.C.), University of Arizona, Weatherspoon Art Museum (University of North Carolina at Greensboro), and Whitney Museum of American Art. Unless otherwise indicated, these museums are in New York. Art activism During the early years of her career Schmidt joined the Society of Independent Artists and the Salons of America as well as the Whitney Studio Club and these connections suggest a liberal, or as it was then termed, radical attitude toward art and artists. Wishing to further the careers of young American artists, these organizations aimed to counter the conservative practices of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences by holding exhibitions free of juries and prizes and offering works for sale without commission. They engaged the New York public with advertising and with publicity campaigns having slogans such as \\"what is home without a modern picture?\\" In joining them Schmidt placed herself among the progressive and independent artists of the time. In 1923, the same year in which she was given a solo show at the Whitney Studio Club, Schmidt's work appeared in the New Gallery on Madison Avenue. The gallery was then in its inaugural year, she was one of the few women included in its roster, and a painting of hers achieved what was probably her first commercial sale. It may be more significant, however, that the New Gallery had published a strongly-worded manifesto which aligned it with the club as a liberal force in the New York art world. The statement said the gallery was \\"an experiment to ascertain whether there is a public ready to take an interest in contemporary pictures which are something more than slick and servile patterns of the past\\" and it envisioned the formation of a society of artists who agreed with its goals. To accomplish this vision the gallery formed a club made up of artists and gallery patrons of which Schmidt became a member. In the early 1930s Schmidt participated in another organization devoted to the support of art in contemporary American culture, and on behalf of that organization she led an effort to convince museums that they should compensate artists through rental fees when they exhibited works without purchasing them. The organization was the American Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Gravers and her position was chair of the Committee on Rentals. Despite repeated requests and an intense publicity campaign most museums refused to pay the requested rental fees. The controversy reached a peak when many artists refused to participate in a show at the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh and it dwindled out after the museums and several influential art critics refused to budge. In the mid-1930s Schmidt and Kuniyoshi had what proved to be an amicable divorce and, believing herself happily independent, she was surprised to find herself in love. Her second husband was Irvine J. Shubert who would become a lifelong companion. Because Shubert made a good living as a lawyer, she did not experience the financial straits which afflicted many other artists in those times. All the same she became a strong supporter of government support of the arts and when it was announced that the Federal Art Project would be shut down she joined Alfred Barr and others in giving testimony before a congressional committee to urge its continuance. After its demise she helped draw up a plan by which New York State would purchase works by artists for use in public buildings and for exhibitions that would circulate to public buildings and community centers. Although the effort did not succeed, it helped inspire the state's Council on Arts some years later. Of her involvement in arts activism Schmidt later said, \\"I enjoyed very much doing that kind of thing. I had been freed from a lot of responsibilities and I had the time to do it.\\" Personal life Schmidt was born on February 6, 1899, in Xenia, Ohio. Both her parents had been born in Germany having emigrated to the United States following the turmoil of the German revolutions of 1848–49. They named her after a maternal aunt whose amateur painting would help Schmidt find her own love of art. She had one sibling, Anna, who was a year younger. Before she was ten her family moved to New York City. There she attended local public schools and was still a high school student when she started attending Saturday afternoon classes at the Art Students League. Schmidt met Yasuo Kuniyoshi in 1917 while studying at the League. When they married two years later Schmidt's parents cut her off from the family and formally disowned her, causing her to lose American citizenship. Because Kuniyoshi had little income and Schmidt none, they were fortunate to have been supported by Hamilton Easter Field's gift of places to stay during the winter at a house he owned in Brooklyn and during the summer in a small studio he had built in Ogunquit. While the summer place proved to be temporary, the apartment in Brooklyn was theirs to use, free of payment, from the time they married until their divorce in 1932. Despite careful budgeting of limited finances, they both had to take jobs, Schmidt as director of a sketch class at Whitney and as informal assistant to Juliana Force and Kuniyoshi as frame- maker and art photographer. They were able to earn enough to support a ten- month trip to Europe over 1926 and 1926, a return trip in 1928, and the purchase of a house in Woodstock, N.Y., in 1932. They returned to France in May 1928 but Schmidt came back to New York early saying the French influence did not suit her and that she was most comfortable with what she called \\"American corn.\\" After they had begun spending their summers in the Woodstock house she found that managing it and providing hospitality to the many guests they were expected to entertain kept her from making art. When Kuniyoshi and Schmidt divorced in 1932 she stopped spending her summers in Woodstock. Although she was upset about Kuniyoshi's failure to treat her as an equal, the divorce was not acrimonious and the two remained friends. She was at his bedside when he died in 1953 and subsequently remained on good terms with his wife Sara. Soon after the divorce she was befriended by a young lawyer with artistic inclinations and the following year they married. They lived in Greenwich Village for some years, but after he became a vice president for a large hotel chain, they moved to a hotel apartment. She welcomed the change because it was time-consuming and frustrating for her to maintain an old townhouse during wartime labor shortages and apartment living gave her more time to paint and draw. Her new husband, Irvine J. Shubert, had been born in Austria in 1902. His family emigrated to New York in 1910 and he became a lawyer on graduating from Columbia University Law School in 1925. Schmidt was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1964. Two operations and a long recovery period reduced the time she could devote to painting and drawing. She nonetheless remained at work and survived until 1978 when she died of a recurrence of cancer. Other names Schmidt used Katherine Schmidt as her professional name throughout her career. An exception appeared in 1921 when she showed in the fifth annual exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists as \\"K. Kuniyoshi.\\" In transacting business and performing community service functions she was sometimes known by either of her married names, Kuniyoshi or Shubert.

It was created in the area of Hafun (then called \\"Dante\\") by the Italians in northern Italian Somalia.The biggest Salt mine in the world (in Italian) In 1941, it was destroyed during the British conquest of Italian East Africa, in World War II. History In 1930, an Italian firm called \\"Società Saline e Industrie della Somalia settentrionale Migiurtina\\" (\\"Saline Companies and Industries of Northern Somalia Migiurtina\\") invested huge capital to exploit salt deposits in Dante and Hurdiyo. The Hafun Salt Factory was created and was the main producing facility of sea salt on the world in the 1930s. By 1933 or 1934, the Dante salt works were producing more than 200,000 metric tons of salt, most of which was exported to India & the Far East. The industrial facility of \\"Saline Dante\\" gave work to 600 Italians and 2000 natives (nearly all the native males in Hafun), giving a huge boost to the local Somali economy: Dante city (now called Hafun) grew to more than 5000 inhabitants in 1939. Electrical plants were built in the Dante area for the facility, together with an aqueduct, solving the semi-desert area problems for the first time in its history. The production reached nearly half a million tons per year in the late 1930s and was supposed to increase in the 1940s, but World War II stopped it.

Vesa was born and he did his studies in Helsinki. Following his graduation as Mechanical Engineer in 1921 he worked in Germany and United States in engineering and automotive companies. He returned in Finland in 1927 working for the following five years for Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Oy in Tampere. Yrjö Vesa started his career in Helsinki-based engineering company Kone ja Silta in 1932. The company was taken over by Wärtsilä and by time Vesa became manager of Kone ja Silta, and subsequently he was Deputy Director of Wärtsilä until 1947. During the 1930s and 1940s Vesa was board member and later chairman of the Finnish Employers' Central Association (STK). His most difficult time as negotiator was after the World War II, when communists organised several strikes and reached for weight in companies. Yrjö Vesa became the first manager of state-owned Valmet. He was involved at starting tractor and paper machine production, which later grew flourishing businesses. The company's shipyards created problems, and when the board wanted to produce ships unprofitably due to employment reasons, Vesa was against it, and was subsequently fired. For the rest of his career he managed an insurance company.  Early years and studies  Vesa's parents were Matti Viktor Vesa and Maria Theresia née Gustafsson. He did studied in Helsinki Finnish Normal Lyceum and did his matriculation exam in 1917. Vesa continued his studies in Finnish University of Technology and graduated MSc in Mechanical Engineering in 1921.  Career = Early career = Already during his studies, in 1919–1920, Vesa had worked as manager of Motor Battalion workshop; he worked as depot manager in 1921–1922. At the same time he worked in patent office under Ministry of Trade and Industry. In 1922 Vesa moved to Germany where he worked as workshop engineer for Siemens-Schuckert- Werke GmbH and Protos Automobile GmbH in 1922–1924. In 1925 Vesa moved to the United States where he first worked as mechanic at H. Drexler in New York City, then he became draftsman at American Machine & Foundry Co. in Brooklyn. Still in the same year he changed to Westinghouse Electric Co. where he worked as draftsman until 1926. During 1926–1927 he was employed by Columbus Die & Tool Co. in Columbus, Ohio as special tool designer. Vesa returned in Finland in 1927. During 1927–1932 Vesa worked as workshop engineer for Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Oy in Tampere. = Kone- ja Siltarakennus and Wärtsilä = In 1932 Vesa changed to Kone- ja Siltarakennus (Kone ja Silta), a Helsinki-based engineering company. He started as manager of separator workshop. Vesa was appointed Technical Manager in 1934. In 1935 the company was taken over by Wärtsilä. The Wärtsilä manager Wilhelm Wahlforss trusted Vesa who had a similar vivid temper and style of making decisions quickly. Wahlforss first made him Deputy Director and in the end of 1936 Vesa was appointed Manager of Kone ja Silta. In spring 1939 Vesa participated in Wärtsilä trade negotiations with Soviet Union. The negotiations were successful, the company was to get orders for steamships, pulp boilers and steam boilers, but the Winter War, that bursted out in the same year, cancelled the agreement. In 1942, during the Continuation War, Wahlforss appointed Vesa Deputy Manager of Wärtsilä Group. Running up and managing military supply production kept Vesa busy. After the war ended to Moscow Armistice, Vesa negotiated about war reparations as representative of the Finnish war reparation industry. = Employers' organisation = During 1937–1941 Vesa had been deputy chairman in Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association and Deputy Board member of the Finnish Employers' Central Association (STK). Wahlforss had been member of board of STK since 1931 and Deputy chairman in 1937–1942. Despite of requests, he did not want to become chairman. In 1941 Vesa became actual board member of STK and in 1942 he was selected as a chairman. The association manager, Antti Hackzell, was a close friend of Wahlforss and Wärtsilä board member. The strong presence of engineering industry, and Wärtsilä in particular, caused concern amongst the STK forest industry representatives, who accused the engineering industry about coup d'état. In January 1940 STK and the trade union Finnish Federation of Trade Unions (SAK) officially recognised each other as representative, negotiating parties. Since then, the employers' side had been expecting initiatives from the union. In spring 1943 SAK proposed a general agreement. The negotiations began with meetings between chairmen of both parties. At the beginning of the process Vesa tried to exclude collective agreement from the package, but eventually failed; the pressure from the union side was high, and finally, in spring 1944, Vesa had to sign the general agreement, which included a collective agreement. After the war against Soviet Union ended in September 1944, labour disputed bursted out as number of legal and illegal strikes. This created challenges to the war reparations industry which had to follow the strict schedule set in the armistice. Moreover, the strikes often included volatile demonstrations, which were feared to escalate riots leading communists rising to power. A critical occasion took place in Turku in spring 1945 when workers of Crichton-Vulcan shipyard started overtime ban. According to the armistice, the yard capacity was prioritised to Soviet Navy vessels which were needed in the Soviet East Pomeranian Offensive. Many of the Soviet vessels brought to the yard, mostly submarines, were severely damaged. The yard workers were tired because of the intense workload and required a such increase to their salaries that it would assure livelihood by normal working hours. The Soviet military leadership had no understanding towards Finnish labour disputes. Prime minister Paasikivi was afraid that Soviet Union would even occupy Finland if the dispute would not be resolved; he called Vesa into his office and told him that the union action must be ended at any cost. Vesa went directly to meet the communist Minister of the Interior, Yrjö Leino, who had been his classmate in the Normal Lyceum. Leino made him a document that included an order to end the action. After Vesa showed the paper in Turku the overtime ban was withdrawn in March 1945. Communist minister Yrjö Murto suggested creating production committees at workplaces. The employers saw it as an attempt to promote socialism. The employers started countermeasures under Vesa's lead, and finally the Production Committee Act introduced in 1946 defined the committees purely advisory. The intense war reparation industry required professional leadership, which was not sufficiently available. Vesa initiated founding of industrial management institute in STK board meeting in 1945. STK collected the funding and the Management Institute of Industry was started already in the following year when it organised ten management courses. Vesa also criticised the contemporary Finnish school system in which the children were put to select the line of their studies at an early stage. He suggested creating a such school which would give basic education for the whole generation. In 1947 Vesa was awarded vuorineuvos title due to his contribution as company and employers' association. He worked as STK chairman until 1947 when he started as manager in newly formed Valtion Metallitehtaat (State Metalworks) company and he was forced to give up his position in STK; this was due to demand of the political left wing, which at first did not accept membership of employers' association for managers of the state owned companies. = From State Metalworks to Valmet = When Yrjö Vesa started as manager of Valtion Metallitehtaat, it was a miscellaneous group of small companies which had been collected together in 1946. The companies had produced military supplies during the wartime after which they had focused on war reparations. Management and administration of a such arrangement turned out to be problematic, and therefore the state put them under one company, Valmet Oy, which was founded at the end of 1950. Vesa was involved at starting tractor and paper machine production; these divisions grew later successful lines of business. The Valmet shipyards caused a lot of problems. During the war they had operated as repairs yards and for the war reparations they had built such ships which other yards had refused to produce. After the war reparations were paid off the yards did not have enough of orders. The government pressed Valmet to produce ships to Soviet Union with unprofitable prices due to employment reasons. The company board decided that the Helsinki yard must get enough of orders from Soviet Union even if they would not be profitable, or cover all the costs. Vesa stood against such business and subsequently he was removed from office in 1954. After Valmet, Vesa worked for over ten years as manager for Teollisuuden Auto- ja vastuuvakuutus (Vehicle and Liability Insurance Company of Industry) in 1954–1965.

The song was popular during the Spanish–American War, and re-released during World War I. It is sometimes erroneously believed to be an American Civil War song. Charles \\"Chas\\" K. Harris wrote the lyrics and composed the music. The song was originally published by Harris in New York, New York. Originally Harris wrote the song about a fireman. After the USS Maine explosion in Havana Harbor in 1898, Harris rewrote it with a soldier in place of a fireman. The song tells the story of a young soldier who is fatally shot while saving his company's fallen flag. The General, who initially praises the soldier for his brave deed, realizes he is, in fact, his own son. The chorus is the soldier's dying wishes, and is as follows: :\\"Just break the news to mother, :she knows how dear I love her :And tell her not to wait for me :For, I'm not coming home; :Just say there is no other :can take the place of mother :Then kiss her dear, :sweet lips for me, :and break the news to her.\\" The sheet music can be found at Pritzker Military Museum & Library. 1897 version 1897 cover of \\"Break the News to Mother\\" The cover of the 1897 version features three different drawings: one depicts soldiers entering the war; the next shows a fallen soldier; the final is that of a soldier telling a distraught woman the news. Also on the bottom of the cover is a drawing of the battle scene in which the soldier saving the flag, is shot. The American flag is in the background. Along with the drawings, the cover also features a picture on the right-hand side, which varies version to version. One cover has a photograph of a couple. Another version has a photograph of Attie Spence. A man's profile is featured in another cover. This version was arranged by Joseph Clauder. 1916 version 1917 Sheet music cover of \\"Break the News to Mother\\" The 1916 sheet music cover features a picture of a group of soldiers aiding a fallen soldier. The photo is framed inside of a snare drum. The cover was designed by the Starmer Brothers. It was written for both voice and piano. 1917 version The vocal group, Shannon Four, recorded a version of Break the News to Mother in Camden, New Jersey on July 31, 1917. It was published by Victor Records. Recordings It was recorded by J. W. Meyer in 1904, by Henry Burr, and the Shannon Four in 1917.

Here were ancient quarries for amethyst. The Wadi el-Hudi is important in archaeology for its high number of rock inscriptions and stelae, mainly dating to the Middle Kingdom, as amethyst was especially popular in this period. The Wadi el-Hudi ends in the Nile valley a few kilometers north of Aswan and is coming there from the South-East. The ancient amethyst quarries are about 20 kilometres south-east from Aswan.Ashraf I. Sadek: Wadi el-Hudi: The amethyst mining Inscriptions I, Text, Warminster 1980, , p. 1, map 1, on p. 177  Inscriptions  The earliest datable inscriptions in the Wadi el-Hudi belong to king Mentuhotep IV who reigned around 2000 BC. in the 11th Dynasty. These are five texts dated to the first year of the king and clearly report the aim of the expedition as bringing amethyst.Sadek: Wadi el-Hudi, pp. 4-15 Further inscriptions date to the 12th Dynasty under king Senusret I. One of them mentions the vizier Intefiqer, another one the high steward Hor.Sadek: Wadi el-Hudi, pp. 16-36, 84-92 The 12th Dynasty kings Amenemhat II, Senusret III and Amenemhat III are also attested with expeditions and inscriptions.Sadek: Wadi el-Hudi, pp. 37-43, 93-97 The last 12th Dynasty king sending an expedition to the Wadi was Amenemhat IV.Sadek: Wadi el-Hudi, pp. 44-45 Finally there are several texts providing evidence for an expedition under the 13th Dynasty king Sobekhotep IV. His expedition is dated to the sixth year of his reign.Sadek: Wadi el-Hudi, pp. 46-52 Hathor, who is called lady of amethyst, appears often in the inscriptions. In March 2019, the discovery of more than 100 ancient inscriptions carved into rock, 14 stele and 45 ostraca dated back to the Middle Kingdom was announced by archaeologists. In one of the 3,400-year-old stelas was written the name of a senior official named Usersatet.  Archaeology  In addition to the inscriptions, 39 archaeological sites exist across the region. They are amazingly well preserved, with walls still standing two meters high. These archaeological sites have the key to understanding gem mining, organization of labor by the Egyptian government, use of slaves in Egypt, Egyptian and Nubian interactions, literacy levels within a soldiering class, governmental supply and support of expedition projects, and where much of the amethyst from the ancient Mediterranean World likely originated. Further mining activities, including gold mining, are known from other periods of Egyptian history, up to the Roman Period,Ian Shaw: Late Roman Amethyst and old Mining at Wadi el-Hudi, in: Thomas Schneider and Kasia Szpakowska (eds.)

It was discovered in 2010 during a survey of rainforests in the northern part of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It was named in honour of the American zoologist, William T. Stanley, of the Field Museum, Chicago, who has done much research into the amphibians of Tanzania. It is present at three locations along the eastern border of Chome Forest Reserve at altitudes between . It is rated as \\"critically endangered\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Description Frogs in the genus Callulina are endemic to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. They are characterised by short blunt snouts and plump bodies covered with glandular warts. Callulina stanleyi has a snout-to-vent length of . The dorsal surface is mainly brown with symmetrical darker brown or black streaks. The body is covered with granulations, and the larger glandular masses are pale tan, as are the underparts. It has expanded tips to its fingers and toes, and these help to distinguish it from other similar species, Callulina dawida, Callulina laphami and Callulina shengena. It also differs from C. laphami and C. shengena by having visible tympani. It is very close morphologically to Callulina kisiwamsitu, but it can be told from that species by its call and by DNA analysis. Distribution and habitat Callulina stanleyi is known from only three locations on the eastern edge of Chome Forest Reserve in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania at altitudes between . Its total area of occupancy is about . Its habitat is humid tropical submontane forest and it has also been found on roadside verges at night. Ecology C. stanleyi is nocturnal and can be found on the ground or scrambling about in low bushes. The holotype was found during the day in a rotten log. Nothing is known about the breeding behaviour of this frog, but phylogenetic analysis has been used to predict that it exhibits direct development, with the egg mass being laid on land and hatching into juvenile frogs with no tadpole stage. Status This frog has a very small range which is entirely within a protected area. However its three known locations adjoin the eastern boundary of the Chome Forest Reserve, and there is ongoing pressure on the reserve from the needs of the growing human population in the surrounding area. Small-scale logging still takes place in the reserve and any disturbance to its habitat is likely to be detrimental to the frog, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the frog's conservation status as being \\"critically endangered\\".

Ivanović served as the State Secretary of the Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija from 2008 to 2012 and was also a member of the Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija from 2001 to 2008. He was assassinated by unknown perpetrators on 16 January 2018 in North Mitrovica. Early life and career Ivanović was born in Rznić, a village near Dečani in the west of the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, at the time part of the People's Republic of Serbia of FPR Yugoslavia, on 1 April 1953. His father, Bogdan, was a history professor, and his mother, Olga, was a professor of Serbian language and literature. He also had brother Miroslav and sister Nataša. His paternal heritage is Montenegrin. He attended primary and secondary mechanical- technical school in Kosovska Mitrovica. After turning 18, he joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1971. Ivanović enrolled in the Zagreb Military Academy to become a pilot. During his studies he started training karate and quickly became an instructor. Three years into his studies he was diagnosed with congenital vision deficiency and left the Military Academy. He returned to Kosovo and graduated from the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Kosovska Mitrovica, University of Priština. He also studied at the Faculty of Economics in Priština. He continued, parallel to his studies, professionally training in karate. He received higher belts and achieved recognition as an honorary international karate judge. After the studies, he worked in several companies in Kosovska Mitrovica. With the creation of multi-party system in SFR Yugoslavia in 1990, he stepped out of parties, stating that he is \\"a man of the people\\". From 1991 to 1998, he was the head of Sports Center in Kosovska Mitrovica. Prior to the Kosovo War and the establishment of UNMIK in Kosovo, Ivanović was a less known member of the Socialist Party of Serbia in Kosovska Mitrovica. Political career=1999–2008: Leader of Kosovo Serbs= ;1999–2004 With the establishment of the Serbian National Council of Kosovo and Metohija in 1999, he was appointed as the president of the executive board for North Kosovo. He was removed from this position on 6 June 2001. He was also removed from the presidential function of the Regional Board of Serbian National Council in October 2001. Also, from 1998 to 2004, he served as the general director of nickel mine company \\"Feronikl\\" located in Glogovac. Ivanović joined the Democratic Alternative led by Nebojša Čović. On 2 August 2001, he became the Head of the Department for Economic Development and Reconstruction of the \\"Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija\\", while the Head of the Center was Nebojša Čović. Ivanović led the Coalition \\"Return\\" in the 2001 Kosovan parliamentary election held in November 2001, getting 89,388 votes which earned 22 places in the Assembly of Kosovo (120 places in total) for his coalition. He was appointed as the minister in the newly formed Government of Kosovo and a member of the Presidency of the Assembly of Kosovo on 2 December 2001. In March 2004, a violent unrest in Kosovo broke out, in which Kosovo Albanians took part in wide-ranging attacks on the Kosovo Serbs minority. The Government of Kosovo consisted of Serbian representatives fell soon after. ;2004–2008 In 2004, Ivanović's party Democratic Alternative (DA) merged into the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and he together with Nebojša Čović became one of the party's leaders. Also, in the same year he became the director of the National Employment Service for Kosovo and Metohija controlled by the Government of Serbia. He was the leader of the Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija in the 2004 Kosovan parliamentary election held in October 2004. The election was massively boycotted by Kosovo Serbs. Eventually, the list won 1,414 votes, thus taking 8 out of 10 Serbian minority places in the Assembly of Kosovo (110 places in total). =2008–2012: Governmental position= Ivanović in 2011 in Belgrade On 17 February 2008, Kosovo Albanians unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in the Assembly of Kosovo. In a meeting attended by 109 of the total 120 MPs, the assembly unanimously declared Kosovo's independence,\\"Kosovo MPs proclaim independence\\", BBC News Online, 17 February 2008 while all 11 representatives of the Kosovo Serbs minority boycotted the proceedings. In July 2008, Ivanović joined the Government of Serbia as the State Secretary of the newly formed Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija under Minister Goran Bogdanović. The Ministry took over jurisdictions of disbanded \\"Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija\\". In January 2010, the SDP ceased to exist, which resulted in an exchange of bitter words between Ivanović and Čović. Soon after, he formed a civic initiative \\"Srbija, demokratija, pravda\\" (Eng. \\"Serbia, democracy, justice\\"). Since then, he served as president of the civic initiative. He stayed on the position of the State Secretary until July 2012. In July 2012, following the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election, Serbian Progressive Party led by Aleksandar Vučić and Socialist Party of Serbia led by Ivica Dačić formed the Government of Serbia. =2013–2018: Political decline= In April 2013, the Government of Serbia and the Government of Kosovo signed the Brussels Agreement on the normalization of their relations. ;2013 Local elections In September 2013, Ivanović announced that his civic initiative was forced to change its name from \\"SDP\\" - \\"Srbija, demokratija, pravda\\" (Eng. \\"Serbia, democracy, justice\\"), to \\"GI SDP - Oliver Ivanovic\\", following the request of the Central Election Commission of Kosovo, which banned the use of the other countries' name for names of political organizations operating in Kosovo. Ivanović decided to run in the 2013 Kosovan local elections for the president of North Mitrovica, with his civic initiative \\"SDP\\". The election campaign was marked with the Serbian Progressive Party-led Government of Serbia public calls to Kosovo Serbs to come out and vote in Kosovan elections organized by the Government of Kosovo, for the first time since Kosovo gained independence. The Government of Serbia also called the citizens to vote for the Serb List candidates. Eventually, Ivanović lost to Krstimir Pantić of the civic initiative Serb List, finishing with 1,924 votes (45.62%). ;2014–17 Imprisonment and threats In January 2014, two months following the local elections, Ivanović was arrested on suspicion over war crimes during the 1990s. He was sentenced to nine years in jail on 21 January 2016 for war crimes by judges from the EULEX Kosovo. However, the Appeals Court in Pristina annulled the guilty verdict on 12 February 2017 and ordered a new trial. In July 2017, his car was burned down by unknown perpetrators. In September 2017, three months after the 2017 Kosovan parliamentary election, the Serb List with the support of the Serbian political leadership, formed the Government of Kosovo with PANA Coalition, which is formed of former Kosovo Liberation Army leaders (active in Kosovo War). Ivanović was released from prison in early 2017 and at that time pointed out the poor circumstances in North Kosovo where Serbs formed the majority. In an interview, he stated that Kosovo Serbs in North Kosovo are not afraid of Kosovo Albanians, but rather of, \\"Serbs, local criminals who ride in SUVs without car plates\\". He also said that, \\"Drugs are sold on every corner and parents are very concerned.\\" He pointed that in just a few years, there had been over 50 cases of burned vehicles, many hand grenades thrown, and two unresolved murders committed, and added that, \\"All this happened on a territory of just two and a half square kilometers, which happens to be completely covered by security cameras\\". He surmised that, \\"It was obvious that police forces are afraid to offend the perpetrators\\" and that, \\"Perpetrators likely come from security forces.\\" ;2017 Local elections He decided to run in 2017 Kosovan local elections for the president of North Mitrovica, with his civic initiative \\"SDP\\". During the campaign, he publicly criticized the Government of Serbia and ruling Serbian Progressive Party for favoring Serb List over other Serbian parties in Kosovan local elections. Goran Rakić, a leader of the Serb List and opponent in elections for North Mitrovica, labelled Ivanović as an \\"irrelevant person\\" in Kosovo politics. Also, prominent officials of the Government of Serbia among whom was the director of the Office for Kosovo and Metohija Marko Đurić, blatantly discredited Ivanović labeling him as \\"traitor\\" and anti-Serbian politician. Ivanović responded by saying: \\"I have proven my Serbian patriotism in a much more difficult way than those who are accusing me of being anti-Serbian, I hope, will have to prove theirs [Serbian patriotism]. Eventually, Ivanović finished in second place with 1,475 votes (18.52%), behind Goran Rakić who received 5,372 votes (67.45%). Also, the Serb List won in all 10 Serb-majority municipalities. Assassination Ivanović's grave at the Belgrade New Cemetery On 16 January 2018, Ivanović was shot in a drive-by shooting at 08:17 CET, while entering his office in North Mitrovica. Resuscitation was performed at Mitrovica Hospital shortly afterwards up to 9:15, but it was unsuccessful. Autopsy findings revealed that Ivanović was killed by six 9mm PARA bullets from a Zastava M70A pistol, mainly hitting his upper torso (vital organs - upper aorta, hollow vein and liver). In an interview four days prior to the assassination, he admitted that he feared for his safety. Soon afterwards, the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, scheduled an urgent session of the National Security Council of Serbia. He condemned the assassination and described it as an \\"act of terror\\". The Government of Kosovo condemned the assassination as well. This was the first assassination of a Serbian politician since the murder of former Prime Minister of Serbia Zoran Đinđić fifteen years earlier, on 12 March 2003. His funeral was on Thursday, 18 January, in Belgrade New Cemetery.  Investigation = Investigation in Kosovo = Kosovo police arrested four persons on 23 November 2018: three suspected towards involvement in the murder and one for obstruction to police work. Silvana Arsović, Oliver Ivanović party's administrator, was detained for 48 hours on 26 November 2018 to be questioned under suspicion as if she manipulated security cameras outside the party office in Mitrovica before the murder, when the murder took place near the office. Prosecutor Syle Hoxha said that Silvana Arsović was detained only for 48 hours. Kosovo police officer Dragiša Marković was detained for 1 day on 10 February 2018 under suspicion of manipulating the evidences on the place of the murder of Oliver Ivanović. Then, he was arrested the second time on 23 November 2018. Kosovo prosecutor Njazi Rexha said Dragiša Marković was not getting his duties in right order towards the crime scene. Kosovo police officer Nedeljko Spasojević was arrested on 23 November 2018 towards the murder. Marko Rosić, a person associated by media with Partizan Belgrade fan club, was arrested in the north Kosovo on 23 November 2018. Mario Milošević, a Montenegrin citizen, was arrested on 18 July 2018 in Pristina. (He was also on a warrant list by Interpol towards separate murder connected with organized crime in Podgorica.) Strahinja Danković was arrested together with Mario Milošević. Montenegrin media call him a football fan of Serbian club FK Rad. Milan Radoičić, a businessman and head of Kosovo Serb party ″Srpska Lista″, was on suspicion towards involvement in the murder, his home was raided by Kosovo Police on 23 November 2018, but he escaped arrest fleeing to Serbia. There in Serbia, Milan Radoičić was interviewed on 26 November 2018 by Serbian police, when he denied his any involvement in the case. Serbian president Alexander Vučić said that Milan Radoičić is innocent, and Kosovo police wanted to kill him during raid to put guilt of organizing the murder on Serbian government. Kosovo prosecutor Syle Hoxha said on 16 April 2019 they added 2 persons in investigation as suspected to the organized crime. He didn't name the suspected. In February 2020 started a trial against six Serbs charged with the participation in the assassination of Ivanovic. All of them pleaded not guilty of all charges at the preparatory hearing before Pristina’s Special Court. = Investigation in Serbia = Nebojša Stefanović, Serbian Interior Minister, told in January 2019 that Serbia is leading its own investigation towards the murder tracing some persons who were in north Kosovo then moved to Western Europe. He didn't name the suspected. President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić stated that German Albanian Fljorim Ejupi is the wanted assassin, which was negated by the government in Priština. Personal life Beside his native language Serbian, he also spoke Albanian, English and Italian. He was in relationship with Milena Popović, with whom he had a son.

Early life Marturano grew up in Clifton, New Jersey, the child of first generation Italian immigrant parents. She graduated with a Juris Doctor (JD) from NYU School of Law in 1982. She worked as a business lawyer at Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle and then as in-house counsel for Panasonic and Nabisco. General Mills Marturano joined General Mills in 1996, and became Deputy General Counsel and Vice President, Public Responsibility. She had a leading role in the complex eighteen-month business deal that occurred when General Mills acquired the Pillsbury Company in 2001; the timing of which coincided with the death of both her parents. Looking for a way to regain her strength and health, she enrolled in a mindfulness workshop taught by Jon Kabat-Zinn, the MIT PhD who created the Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) framework. With a goal of sharing her own experience, Marturano developed Mindful Leadership training for her colleagues at General Mills. While still a corporate officer at General Mills, she received her mindfulness teacher certification from the University of Massachusetts Medical School's Center for Mindfulness and went on to co-develop the first mindful leadership curricula at the University of Massachusetts Medical School's Center for Mindfulness where she later served as a member of the Advisory Board. In 2008, this Mindful Leadership training was opened to leaders from other organizations. Mindful Leadership In order to teach Mindful Leadership full-time, Marturano left General Mills in 2010 and founded the Institute for Mindful Leadership. Combining mindfulness with her experience as a former officer of a Fortune 200 company, she developed curricula to bring training in mindful leadership to leaders from corporate, non-profit, academic, government, and military organizations. She heads a team of instructors experienced in mindfulness training and with a variety of organizational leadership backgrounds; they collaborate to tailor curricula to suit individual clients, as well as offering programs to the general public. In 2013, she was invited to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to share her understanding of the importance of mindful leadership. She spoke again at the 2014 World Economic Forum Conference in Tianjin, China and has been a featured speaker at the Wisdom 2.0 Business Conference in NY, Global Mindful Leadership Conference in Australia, and Mindful Leadership Forum in Washington, DC. Marturano's writings and work have been featured on BBC News, and in The New York Times, The Financial Times, Time magazine, and the Los Angeles Times. In March 2016, Arianna Huffington selected Janice Marturano as a Huffington Post Pioneer, a HuffPost Originals video series that profiles leaders in various industries.  Finding the Space to Lead: A Practical Guide to Mindful Leadership  Janice Marturano's first book, Finding the Space to Lead: A Practical Guide to Mindful Leadership (Bloomsbury Press, 2014), won a 2014 Silver Nautilus Book Award in the category of Business/Leadership and has been translated into many languages.

() was the battle cry and motto of the Kingdom of France (including the Bourbon Restoration). It allegedly referred to Charlemagne's legendary banner the Oriflamme, which was also known as the \\"Montjoie\\" (Old French: Munjoie) and was kept at the Abbey of Saint Denis, ultimately in reference to Saint Dionysius, though alternative explanations exist (see below). The battle cry was first used during the reign of Louis VI of France (r. 1108–1137), the first royal bearer of the Oriflamme. Etymology of \\"Montjoie\\" The etymology of the term \\"Montjoie\\" is uncertain and debated, with three main hypotheses for its origin. It is first recorded in The Song of Roland (12th century). The Catholic Encyclopedia suggested it originated in a term for marking stones or cairns set up on the roadside, in Late Latin known as mons Jovis (\\"mountain of Jove\\"), which from in Middle French appears as monjoie. According to the Encyclopedia, cairns were used by warriors as gathering places and was applied to the Oriflamme, by analogy in that it guided warriors into combat like they would meet by said cairns. = Alternative hypotheses = \\"Montjoie\\" has also been proposed as being derived from a Germanic source, *mund gawi (\\"pile of stones\\"), supposedly used as a battle cry in a sense of \\"hold the line!\\". It has alternatively been proposed as deriving from *mund galga, from mund (\\"protect\\") and galga (\\"cross, rood\\", as pilgrims would often affix crucifixes to these stones).Joseph J. Duggan, A Guide to Studies on the Chanson de Roland, DS Brewer, 1976, pp. 53f.Saint- Allais 1816: Ce qu'on a de plus sensé sur cette matière se réduit à remarquer qu'on appelait autrefois Mont-Joye un monceau de pierres entassées pour marquer les chemins ; sur quoi le Cardinal Huguet de Saint-Cher rapporte la coutume des pèlerins, qui faisaient des Mont-Joyes de monceaux de pierres sur lesquels ils plantaient des croix aussitôt qu'ils découvraient le lieu de dévotion où ils allaient en pèlerinage [...] Or, comme ces Mont-Joyes étaient destinés à marquer les chemins, de même, quand nos rois eurent pris Saint- Denis pour protecteur du royaume, et sa bannière ou l'oriflamme pour bannière de dévotion dans les armées, cette bannière devint le Mont-Joye qui réglait la marche de l'armée [...] Il est bon aussi d'observer que ce cri de guerre n'a été introduit dans nos armées que vers le règne de Louis-le-Gros, qui, ayant réuni en sa personne le comté de Vexin à la couronne, devint avoué de l'église de Saint-Denis, en prit la bannière, de laquelle est venu le cri d'armes.

Dam In the late 1800s, Storvatnet was a water reservoir for the mill \\"Lyhs-mølla\\", which was built by the Gammelfossen waterfalls. The water level of Storvatnet was controlled in the dam by logs piled to form an adjustable barrier in an opening in the waterfall. In the 70's, the Storvatnet was permanently barraged by the local water company.  Recreation As a drinking water reservoir, swimming is prohibited. The surrounding areas are popular hiking areas and the lake it is popular for recreational fishing. The only access to the small islets (except via the ice during winter) is by rowing boats. In recent years, small sailing boats have been observed on the Storvatnet.  Fauna The area surrounding Storvatnet has rich animal and bird life.

It won the Golden Bear at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 89th Academy Awards. It was also selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the awards but it was not nominated in that category. Overview The film was shot on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa during the European migrant crisis, and sets the migrants' dangerous Mediterranean crossing against a background of the ordinary life of the islanders. The main characters are a twelve-year-old boy from a local fishing family and a doctor who treats the migrants on their arrival. In his acceptance speech for the Golden Bear award, Rosi stated that his intention was to heighten awareness of the migrant situation, saying, \\"It's not acceptable that people die crossing the sea to escape from tragedies.\\" Plot A young boy, Samuele Pucillo, cuts a forked twig from a pine tree to make a slingshot. With his friend Mattias Cucina, he then enjoys carving eyes and mouth on some shovels of prickly pear and throwing stones with the slingshot, as if against an enemy army. This happens on the island of Lampedusa, while the men of the Italian Navy's district office, received by radio a request for help, activate the search at sea with naval units and helicopters of the Coast Guard. Meanwhile, life on the island continues. A housewife, Maria Signorello, while preparing lunch, listens to the local radio station led by Pippo Fragapane who broadcasts music and songs on request and gives news about sightings and rescues at sea. Dr. Pietro Bartolo Refugees and migrants from North Africa on overcrowded boats are taken on board Coast Guard ships and then, transhipped on spears and patrol boats, are taken ashore. Here they find Pietro Bartolo, the doctor who directs the outpatient clinic in Lampedusa and who for years has been making his first visit to every migrant who disembarks on the island. They are then transferred by bus to the Lampedusa immigrant reception center, searched and photographed. Samuele talks to Francesco Mannino, a relative fisherman who tells him about when he was a sailor on merchant ships living always on board for six, seven months, between sky and sea. A diver, Francesco Paterna, dives to fish for sea urchins despite the rough sea. At home, during a thunderstorm, Samuel studies and then listens to his grandmother, Maria Costa, who tells him about when, during the Second World War, at night the military ships passed throwing light rockets into the air and the sea turned red, it seemed there was \\"fire at sea\\". Maria Signorello calls the radio to dedicate a cheerful swing Fuocoammare to her fisherman son, wishing the bad weather will end soon so that he can go out on the boat to work. Meanwhile song is on the air, in the immigrant reception centre a group of refugees sing a heartfelt song accompanied by the story of their vicissitudes. Dr. Bartolo, showing the photo of a boat with 860 people, tells of those who have not made it. Especially those who sail below deck for days, tired, hungry, dehydrated, soaked and burned by fuel. Moved and upset, the doctor tells of how many he could treat and how many, however, had to inspect the bodies recovered at sea, including many women and children, making it very difficult to get used to. So, while Samuele grows up and faces his difficulties to become a sailor, in fact in Lampedusa everyone is, the tragedy of migrants and the commitment of rescuers continues at sea. Reception The film has a 95% rating from Rotten Tomatoes, based on 93 reviews with an average rating of 7.82 out of 10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Fire at Sea offers a clear-eyed yet empathetic look at a corner of the world whose terrain may be unfamiliar to many, but whose people's story remains universal\\". It also has a score of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Meryl Streep, chair of the Berlin jury, called the film \\"a daring hybrid of captured footage and deliberate storytelling that allows us to consider what documentary can do. It is urgent, imaginative and necessary filmmaking.\\" Andrew Pulver, writing for The Guardian, described the documentary as having \\"a distinctive, humane cinematic style\\" and being \\"a collection of tiny details that morph, almost by osmosis, into a shocking excavation of the mechanics of crisis.\\" He praises it for approaching the tragedy indirectly, via the people of Lampedusa. The film was also appreciated by the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who stated that he would carry with him 27 DVDs of the film to a session of the European Council. Each one of the copies was given to a head of state or government of the European Union. The Economist thought it had \\"beautiful cinematography and searing images, but also odd choices and murky priorities\\" and took issue with the film's lack of relation between the refugee crisis and the impact it had on the lives of the islanders interviewed. In 2019, The Guardian ranked Fire at Sea in 53rd place in its 100 best films of the 21st century list.

It was the influence of his mother and maternal relatives, especially his older cousin Joan Viza Caball, which prevailed when forming the young Joan;Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 96 as a teenager he engaged in the mainstream Carlist branch, at that time known as Jaimismo. Around 1914 he joined the local Circulo Jaimista at calle de la Puertaferrisa.Ventalló i Vergés 1976 During his academic years he entered the local branch of Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista, the Carlist student organization.La Vanguardia 27.08.76, available here In the early 1920s he was already one of the most dynamic regional party activists of the young generation, becoming member of Junta Directiva of the local circle, secretary of Junta Regional Tradicionalista of CataloniaColl i Alentorn 1993, p. 186 and president of the Barcelona AET.Ventalló i Vergés 1976 The 1923 coup of Primo de Rivera produced dissolution of all parties and brought national political life to a standstill. With Jaimist structures dormant Roca turned towards non-political Carlist activities and commenced co-operation with the Catalan party daily. As Correo Catalan was managed by his father-in-law, Roca became first secretary of the editorial board and later started to contribute himself. He specialized in commentaries on foreign politics; as his position grew, in the mid-1920s he started to write editorials; he usually signed as \\"Daniel Castells\\" and \\"Snomen\\".Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 186, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 96 Junyent was known for his moderate sympathy for Catalanismas opposed to other Catalan Carlist politicians of the early 20th century like Dalmacio Iglesias García, who vehemently confronted emerging Catalanism and at that time also Roca's Carlism was assuming an increasingly pro-Catalan tone,already in 1922 he took part in Conferencia Nacional Catalana, Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 186 though he did not join those who abandoned the movement to join Acció Catalana.like Lluís Vila i d'Abadal His original Traditionalist vision was diluted further on by social-Catholic threads, as he approached Acción Social Popular and its periodicals.first El Social and later Catalunya Social, Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 186; for detailed discussion on Acción Social Popular see La Accion Social Popular de Barcelona, [in:] Revista española de la opinión pública 15-16 (1969), pp. 68-75 His charity engagements were gradually turning him against the regime; forming the circle of Josep Pedragosa Monclús he focused on prison inmates and became member of the Barcelona Junta del Patronato de las Prisiones.Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 186-7; he performed the role for some 15 years, until he resigned in November 1936 shortly before leaving for France, see La Vanguardia 18.11.36, available here don Jaime In the late 1920s Roca formed part of an informal Jaimist nationwide network known as \\"La Protesta\\"; some scholars claim that together with Melchor Ferrer and Pedro Roma he led the Barcelona cell.Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, , p. 285; other scholars do not list Roca as leader of the group and note the names of Ferrer and Antonio Oliveras, see Robert Vallverdú i Martí, El Carlisme Català Durant La Segona República Espanyola 1931-1936, Barcelona 2008, , p. 19 Formed mostly by the youth, the grouplets engaged in conspiracy against the regime. Its format emphasized mobilization and search for wider social basis rather than anti-primoderiverista activities, though at one point the Barcelona hotheads considered staging a coup in La Seu d'Urgell.in 1928, see José Carlos Clemente Muñoz, El carlismo en el novecientos español (1876–1936), Madrid 1999, , p. 74, Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 19. The Madrid cell was led by Francisco Carlos Melgar; other grouplets were active also in Vascongadas, Navarre and Aragon \\"La Protesta\\" was somewhat at odds with generally passive policy of the Carlist executivesome authors claim that the Catalan leadership was aware of its activities but preferred not to intervene, Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 19 though not necessarily with position of the claimant; since 1926 openly opposing Primo, in his Paris residence Don Jaime remained in touch with the Catalanist and liberal exiles.Canal 2000, p. 285 During Berenguer's dictablanda, Roca decided to actively re-enter official politics; in the last elections of the monarchy in April 1931 he co-ordinated party campaign in the Tarragona provinceVallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 71 and unsuccessfully tried his luck as a Traditionalist candidate to the local Sarrià council.Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 187, Joan Auladell i Fonseca, El dir i el fer. Una aproximació a la história d'Unió Democrática de Catalunya, s.l. 2006, p. 6. Following failed negotiations with La Lliga, the Carlists decided not to field their own candidates in Barcelona. The Sarriá borough was an exception; Roca has earlier gained some notoriety for defending autonomy of the area within a new Barcelona administrative system, Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 71 Between Carlism and Christian Democracy Carlist standard After the fall of Alfonsine monarchy and declaration of the Second Spanish Republic Roca held high position within Carlist structures; he was member of the Catalan party executive, Junta Regional, serving as its secretary.the Junta was headed by Roca's father-in-law, Junyent, Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 70 During gear-up to the Cortes Constituentes electoral campaign of June 1931 he negotiated with the conservative Catalanist La Lliga about building a right-wing alliance list in the region. Together with Francisco Gambús and Juan Soler Janer, Roca was one of 3 Carlists forming a joint Carlist-Lliguist candidature;La Vanguardia 24.06.31, available here, also Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 83 he competed in the Tarragona district. The bid bore no fruit and Roca suffered heavy defeat; with the leading contender getting 67.000 votes and the last candidate elected earning 22.000 votes, Roca enjoyed support of only 9.000 voters.La Vanguardia 03.07.31, available here The question of Basque and Catalan autonomy, which occupied much of the public agenda in the summer of 1931, proved a difficult one for the Carlists. Though supporting separate traditional provincial establishments has always been a fundamental part of their program, they were anxious that autonomy might turn into a vehicle of promoting peripheral nationalisms and left-wing ideologies. The original highly federative Carlist draft of Catalan autonomy, produced in 1930, was shelved;named Proyecto de Estatuto de Cataluña, see Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 95; for the full text see Juventudes Carlistas service available here the move prompted frustration of highly pro-Catalanist Carlists; disappointed, Roca resigned from the posts held.Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 97, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 80, Auladell i Fonseca 2006, p. 7 Though eventually the Carlists half-heartedly decided to support the official autonomy scheme,Canal 2000, p. 290 Roca concluded that his vision of Catalan future was no longer compatible within the Traditionalist format.Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 97 Roca announced as a speaker at a Catholic meeting (1933) Together with a group of young Carlistslike Josep Cirera Soler, Josep Trias Peitx, Josep Farré Moregó, Esteve Farré Calveras, Antoni Oliveras Roca got in touch with offshoots from Acció Catalanalike Lluis Vila d'Abadal, Pau Romeva, Ramon Sunyer, Maurici Serahima and encouraged by his old-time mentor, a Capuchin friar Miquel d'Esplugues, in November 1931 he co-founded Unió Democrática de Catalunya.Canal 2000, p. 290; according to some scholars, UDC was \\"nationalist child of Carlism\\", Josep Carles Clemente, Los días fugaces.

De las guerras civiles a la transición democratica, Cuenca 2013, , p. 82 Along Josep Cirera Soler and Lluis Vila d'Abadal he was among those most responsible for its manifesto;signed by 18 individuals, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 92 it identified UDC as a Christian-democratic party advocating Catalonia within the future Iberic Confederation.or Iberian Confederation, in original \\"Confederació Ibèrica\\", see Eduardo Montagut, La creación de Unió Democràtica de Catalunya, [in:] Nueva Tribuna 11.01.16, available here The move marked a dramatic rupture with Traditionalism; instead of its ultra-reactionary, monarchist, antidemocratic, fanatically Catholic outlook, Roca accepted the Republican regime, democratic principles and a democristiano format of religiosity.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 80 Scholars consider his approach non-sectarian, conciliatory and moderate.Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 187 Roca entered top executive bodies of UDCthe names listed by scholars are Comité de Govern, Junta Directiva and especially a small, 5-member executive named Comité d'Acció Politica, see Raguer i Suñer 1976, pp. 172, 223, Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 188, Auladell i Fonseca 2006, p. 10 and emerged as one of its 3 key personalities.along Vila d'Abadal and Pau Romeva, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 97, also Oscar Barberà i Aresté, Alianzas políticas, relaciones de poder y cambio organizativo: el caso de Unió Democràtica de Catalunya, 1978-2003, Barcelona 2011, , p. 47 In the 1932 campaign to Catalan parliament UDC underlined 4 features: loyalty to the Republic,though some scholars claim that Roca and UDC were accidentalists, i.e. considered republic v. monarchy question secondary, compare José Luis Orella Martínez, Las raíces Carlistas de lal Democracia Cristiana, [in:] Aportes: Revista de historia contemporánea 14/40 (1999), p. 115 support for autonomous Catalonia,he declared that \\"el text de d'Estatut és sagrat\\" and constitutes \\"expressió de la voluntat del nostre poble, únic sobirá dels seus destins\\", quoted after Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 134 social-CatholicismRaguer i Suñer 1976, pp. 169-9 and the principle of religious freedom, the last one somewhat at odds with militantly secular course of the Republic.in 1932 Roca intervened with the authorities, defending religious rights of the Catholics, Miguel Batllori, Víctor Manuel Arbeloa, Església i estat durant la Segona República Espanyola, 1931-1936, Barcelona 1977, , p. 276 The party strove to build a broad-base center coalition named \\"Concòrdia ciutadana\\"; for reasons which are not clear, Roca did not run,Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 158 though he was one of the most active party speakers.sometimes speaking at two gatherings in one day, like on November 12, 1933, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 178 In general elections of 1933 Unió refused to join the CEDA-led right-wing blockUDC indirectly alluded to CEDA-led right-wing alliance as \\"feixista\\", Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 172 and attempted to mount another moderate alliance, but negotiations with La Lliga failed. UDC fielded a stand-alone list with 4 candidates, including Roca, in the Barcelona Ciudad district.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 174, La Vanguardia 18.11.33, available here All of them lost and 2.700 votes gathered by RocaRaguer i Suñer 1976, p. 184, Barberà i Aresté 2011, p. 40. The Carlists in their post-electoral analysis attributed their poor showing to many voters having been distracted by Roca and his candidature, Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 121 demonstrated that the party was a second-rate grouplet, with membership reduced to few thousand.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 273 The Third Spanish Republic Catalan standard While the country was undergoing rapid political polarization Roca and UDC tried to keep off what they considered extremes.Raguer i Suñer 1976, pp. 224-237 Having earlier dismissed CEDA as an alliance partner, during talks preceding the 1936 electoral campaign Unió rejected also the offer of Companys, which consisted of few places on the Catalan Frente Popular list; they claimed that Christians could not join the Marxists.Paul Preston, Las Tres Españas, , Madrid 2011, p. 4, also Hilari Raguer, El meu J.B. Roca i Caball (1898-1976), [in:] El Matí 29.01.13, available here Eventually, UDC did not field any candidates. Until the July 1936 coup Roca kept advocating Christian Catalanism,In May he was about to enter a commission of the forthcoming Congreso Juridico, entrusted with working out division of competences between Generalitat and Madrid, La Vanguardia 16.05.36, available here; on July 13 he advocated primary education in Catalan, La Vanguardia 14.07.36, available here though when discussing threats he stressed a fascist menace rather than a proletarian revolution.La Vanguardia 31.03.36, available here After outbreak of the Civil War the party remained loyal to the Republic. When in August the Generalitat security\\"policia normal\\", Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 393; it is not clear what is meant by this term; probably the unit in question was Mossos d'Esquadra, the regular uniformed police service maintained by the Catalan autonomous government launched their search of Roca, result of confusing different members of the family,Joan Bautista Roca i Caball was mistaken for Josep Maria Batista i Roca, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 393 he volunteered to Commisaria General d'Ordre Públic and was detained for 2 weeks. Released, he concluded that remaining in the increasingly chaotic Republican zone posed a mortal threat;Roca's father-in-law fell victim to the unfolding violence. Having learnt the news about Republican repression, especially execution of the Catalan Carlist leader Tomàs Caylà, Miguel Junyent died of heart failure. Accidentally, the following day the Republican militia unit arrived at his flat; they were visibly disappointed they could have not executed Junyent. One of them asked \\"por qué no le damos el tiro de gracia?\\"; Roca's wife was present at the scene, see the paragraph To re-kill the dead in José María Zavala, Los horrores de la Guerra Civil: Testimonios y vivencias de los dos bandos, Madrid 2011, , page not available, see here he resigned from public functionse.g. this of secretary of Comité de servicios correccionales de Cataluñya, La Vanguardia 18.11.36, available here; he was also vice-president of Sociedad para la difusión del libro catalán, La Gaceta de las artes gráficas August 1936, available here, and secretary of CF Barcelona football club and in December 1936 the entire family, escorted by the Generalitat police,some authors claim that Roca received threats from the anarchists, Hilari Raguer i Suner, La Iglesia durante la Segunda Republica y la Guerra Civil, [in:] Paul Aubert (ed.), Religión y sociedad en España (siglos xix y xx): Seminario celebrado en la Casa de Velázquez (1994-1995), Madrid 2002, , p. 52 crossed the French frontier.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 394 They settled in Paris; in financial dire straits, Roca tried to earn a living by teaching Catalan.Auladell i Fonseca 2006, p. 41 In February 1937 Roca co-founded Comité pour la paix civile et religieuse en Espagne and became its secretary.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 443 The organization posed as representing \\"Tercera España\\", siding with none of the warring parties and mobilizing international support for truce based on mutual compromise.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 444 As back in Spain UDC remained loyal to the Republic and even recruited its own party volunteer battalion,La Vanguardia 19.01.39, available here to sustain his \\"Third Spain\\" identity Roca distanced himself from ongoing party activities.UDC kept voicing against \\"international fascism\\", for 1937 see La Vanguardia 17.06.37, available here, for 1938 see La Vanguardia 10.09.38, available here In practical terms, the Comité endorsed a democratic republic deprived of militant secularism;Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 445 it spoke against European non-intervention in favor of \\"intervenció mediadora\\".Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 454. The propaganda of founded Comité was not directly anti- Nationalist, but its line clearly contrasted with efforts of the Nationalist propaganda in France, which aimed at diverting the threat of co-ordinated international intervention, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 463 In April 1938 the Comité produced an own armistice draft;Auladell i Fonseca 2006, p. 41 later it was increasingly focusing on humanitarian issues.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 511 Roca remained active and indeed animated a number of likewise initiatives, e.g. similar committees in other countriesRaguer i Suñer 1976, p. 446, Auladell i Fonseca 2006, p. 41 or separate Comité Catala per a la Pau Civil i Religiosa.set up in mid-1938, Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 503 However, he was not among leaders of Comité d'action pour la paix en Espagne, an initiative deprived of the confessional ingredient.Raguer i Suñer 1976, p. 446 It is not clear whether he visited the Republican zone.some authors hint that Roca might have visited Catalonia in early 1937 to attend the funeral of Carrasco i Formiguera , Hilari Raguer, Gunpowder and Incense: The Catholic Church and the Spanish Civil War, London 2007, , p. 175 Serrano Suñer in name of the Franco government named his efforts \\"maquinaciones\\" and declared him \\"separatista\\".Arnau Gonzàlez i Vilalta, Enric Ucelay-Da Cal, Contra Companys, 1936: La frustración nacionalista ante la Revolución, Valencia 2012, , p. 345 Wehrmacht in Bordeaux, 1942 After the end of hostilities Roca's public activity was reduced to organizing assistance for refugees from the Republican zone, massively fleeing into France;Auladell i Fonseca 2006, p. 50 none of the sources consulted claims he was engaged in political activities of the Republican exiles. In late 1939 the Roca family - still in difficult financial conditions - moved away from Paris and settled in Bordeaux, where they were offered hospitality in a house of distant family relatives, the building left entirely at their disposal.Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 190 In late 1940, already after the city had been occupied by the Germans, his wife and two children transferred to Spain.

Raguer Suñer, Gaudeamus Igitur: notes per a una història del \\"Grup Torras i Bages\\" : documents i records, Barcelona 1999, , pp. 112-3 though he was spared heavy repressive measures; once briefly detained, he was questioned by the police also in few other cases.Coll i Alentorn 1993, p. 190 On the other hand, in the mid-1950s he already enjoyed a fairly prestigious status in the Barcelona societé, acknowledged by official press in the \\"sociedad\\" columns.in 1948 the press acknowledged his wedding anniversary, see La Vanguardia 27.05.48, available here, in 1952 named him in \\"Personalidades\\" section, La Vanguardia 07.05.52, available here, and in 1954 noted the wedding of his daughter, La Vanguardia 28.05.54, available here Middle and late Francoism CdF Barcelona, 1961 In the late 1950s UDC was in impasse; Roca is credited for overcoming the crisis.the group activity stagnated due to wear-out of its format, Culla 1990, p. 4, Auladell i Fonseca 2006, p. 53 As the regime assumed more liberal shape, at the turn of the decades the UDC activists took to more open forms of activity.

D'Arcy (born 1972) is a Canadian neuroscientist, researcher, innovator and entrepreneur. D'Arcy co-founded HealthTech Connex Inc. and serves as President and Chief Scientific Officer. HealthTech Connex translates neuroscience advances into health technology breakthroughs. D'Arcy is most known for coining the term \\"brain vital signs\\" and for leading the research and development of the brain vital signs framework. He is also a full tenured professor with appointments at both Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia. He holds the Surrey Memorial Hospital Foundation BC Leadership Chair in Multimodal Technology for Healthcare Innovations. D'Arcy has published more than 256 academic works, generated more than $85 million in competitive research and innovation investment, and has been recognized through numerous national and international awards and distinctions. Throughout his career, D'Arcy has been advancing brain innovations. He constantly champions Canada's role in the world's neuroscience sphere. He has been advocating for the brain to be monitored regularly to track one's health, as part of any other body's vital signs. He is strongly focused on optimizing brain health through objective measurements to find the best treatments. His work has involved developing accessible technology improvements for evaluation and treatment in brain injury and concussion along with other brain conditions such as dementia, epilepsy, brain tumours and stroke. D'Arcy has played instrumental roles in advancing Canada's biotechnology industry through founding and co-founding a number of large-scale health-technology initiatives over the course of his career while at the [National Research Council Canada‘] (NRC) and Simon Fraser University/Surrey Memorial Hospital. These initiatives include NRC's Institute of Biodiagnostics (Atlantic), now called BIOTIC, and BC's Health and Technology District, encompassing Surrey Memorial Hospital's Health Sciences and Innovation initiative, Innovation Boulevard, the NeuroTech and ImageTech Laboratories, the HealthTech Innovation Hub and the BrainNET initiative. The Health and Technology District continues to grow towards the planned goals of over 1.5 million square feet of health/technology/innovation space, employing more than 15,000 tech and tech related jobs, and generating more than $1.1 billion into the economy annually.  Early life and education  Born and raised in Williams Lake, British Columbia, Ryan D'Arcy attended Brentwood College School, on Vancouver Island, graduating in 1990. He earned a B.Sc. (with distinction) from the University of Victoria in 1996, an M.Sc. in neuropsychology in 1998 and a Ph.D. in neuroscience in 2002 from Dalhousie University. D'Arcy was a Killam Scholar while at Dalhousie University. In 2001, he moved to NRC’s Institute for Biodiagnostics for a Research Associate/Postdoctoral Fellowship in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Physics. He is a member of the Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia, as an engineering licensee (Eng.L.) with a specialization in neuroimaging and neurotechnology. =Brain Vital Signs= Foundational research that led to the concept of brain vital signs started in 1995, with Dr. D’Arcy leading the development of the first rapid, easy, point- of-care measurement of brain waves in 2011. The objective was to utilize electroencephalography (EEG) data, and particularly cognitive evoked potentials (EPs), also known as event-related potentials (ERPs), as an objective physiological measure of brain function. ERPs were well established but had not been translated into a clinically accessible framework in a manner similar to the measurement of a body's vital signs like blood pressure. D’Arcy’s team developed a new brain vital sign framework specific to the evaluation and monitoring of brain function. The brain vital signs framework, which derived from the earlier Halifax Consciousness Scanner work, objectively analyzes complex EEG data through, which then provides simple, practical and objective physiological markers of brain function. The research team subsequently published a series of studies on the development of brain vital signs. These included the Frontiers in Neuroscience Journal, which remains the most highly accessed paper in the journal's history and ranked in the top 5% of research outputs scored by Altmetrics, and findings from a multi-year hockey concussion study conducted in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center in Brain: A Journal of Neurology. The latter study was the first to demonstrate that brain vital sign monitoring is more sensitive in detecting impairments than existing clinical tests for concussions. = HealthTech Connex Inc. = In 2013, D’Arcy and Kirk Fisher co-founded HealthTech Connex Inc. Derived from the brain vital sign science, HealthTech Connex conceived the NeuroCatch Platform to convert electroencephalography recordings (EEG) of the N100 (Auditory sensation), P300 (Basic attention), and N400 (Cognitive processing) into a rapid, portable, non-invasive evaluation platform for point-of-care deployment. = Health and Technology District = D'Arcy also co-founded the Health and Technology District with Lark Group, a Canadian family-owned and operated development, construction and facility management company based in Surrey, British Columbia. The Health and Technology District is a rapidly growing and dynamic new health tech sector located in the heart of Surrey’s emerging innovation ecosystem. The District includes a series of high-tech buildings located and under expansion, directly adjacent to Surrey Memorial Hospital, one of Canada's busiest hospitals. The District is a unique cluster of large, multinational and start-up companies, international partners, clinical and research facilities, scientists, innovators and entrepreneurs. It is also where an abundance of healthcare environments, patients and clinicians are co-located, working in partnership to accelerate the implementation of technologies and solutions towards health care impacts and improvements. The Lark Group developed the Health and Technology District in anticipation of the rapidly growing health and technology sector in British Columbia. The District currently consists of two buildings, City Centre 1 and 2, with City Centre 3 breaking ground in late 2018. In 2019, D'Arcy spearheaded the formation of BrainNET within the Health and Technology District, a clinical-academic-innovation network dedicated to bringing advances in neuro-technologies to individual improvements in brain health through a consortium of initiatives and technologies. = Translating Research into Real-life Impacts = D’Arcy has been credited in helping translate neuroscience advances into real-life impacts. Since 1995, D’Arcy and his research team have led the development of using event-related potentials (ERPs) for clinical evaluations of brain function. In 2010, they developed the Halifax Consciousness Scanner (HCS), a portable ERP device that quickly determines neurological function in cases of severe brain trauma. The HCS technology was widely recognized with several innovation awards, including the 2015 Winner of Wall Street Journal’s Global Technology Start-up Showcase. While developed for functional status evaluation, the HCS prototype ultimately led to the discovery of the brain vital signs framework, which has since led the development the NeuroCatch Platform through HealthTech Connex. The NeuroCatch Platform received its first regulator approval as a Class II Medical Device from Health Canada in early 2019. In 2008, together with neuroscientist and neurosurgeon Dr. David B. Clarke, D'Arcy was part of the research team at the National Research Council at Dalhousie University in developing the world's first virtual reality based neurosurgical simulation and rehearsal tool NeuroTouch, which was subsequently licensed to CAE Inc. as NeuroVR. Subsequently, D'Arcy and Clarke teamed up again, this time with Conquer Mobile to develop PeriopSim, a suite of portable surgical simulation training tools used to train perioperative nurses. D’Arcy was the driving force and original thought leader behind the Simon Fraser University's rapid growth in medical technology research, with the launch of the ImageTech Lab. The SFU ImageTechLab is a first-of-its-kind research facility in Western Canada, combining state-of-the-art imaging devices to advance brain/body research, and focus on advanced diagnostics and treatment in neurology, mental health and other healthcare areas. The ImageTech Lab completed the large-scale initiative announced April 2013 by then City of Surrey Mayor Dianne Watts to create the Mayor's Health Technology Working Group with D’Arcy as co-chair. It composed of leaders from the health, education and development communities to shape a new health-tech region located between Simon Fraser University Surrey and Surrey Memorial Hospital called Innovation Boulevard. Since 2009, D’Arcy has been helping rehabilitate Trevor Greene, a Canadian war veteran and brain injury survivor who was attacked while on tour in Afghanistan with an axe to the head. D'Arcy, together with Trevor and his wife Debbie Greene, have been breaking down the limits of recovery through the use of brain imaging, assistive device, and neuro-modulation technologies paired with intensive rehabilitation. The project (called “Iron Soldier”) has since progressed towards Trevor's goal to climb to the Mount Everest base camp, and catalyzed the Legion Veteran's Village initiative to revitalize Legions across the country into centres for excellence in rehabilitation and post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr. Ryan D'Arcy and Iron Soldier Trevor Greene speak at TedXBearCreekPark As an innovative thought leader, endowed university professor and international speaker, Dr. D’Arcy speaks frequently to large audiences and have done so extensively over the course of his career. A large part of his career has been focused on communicating technology and scientific advances outside of academic and technical scientific forums. He is a 3-times TEDx speaker including Surrey’s TEDxBearCreekPark, TEDxSFU and TEDxBrentwoodCollegeSchool, and has frequently represented Canada in health technology innovation events throughout the world, including leading brain technology missions around the world for over a decade.  Awards  D'Arcy has been awarded a Public Service Award of Excellence, The National Research Council's Research Breakthrough of the Year, and the Discovery Award for Innovation. D’Arcy's team was awarded the International Global Best Award in STEM in 2016 (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). D'Arcy's HealthTech Connex Inc. team won a 2018 Surrey Business Excellence Award from the Surrey Board of Trade. D’Arcy was highlighted as “a Kickass Canadian” amongst other prominent Canadian leaders.

It was discovered in 2014 at the Blue Lias Formation of the United Kingdom, and named in 2016 by British palaeontologist David Martill and colleagues, with the type species being Dracoraptor hanigani. Discovery and naming praemaxillae (frontmost upper jaw bones) The first Dracoraptor fossils were discovered in 2014 near the Welsh town of Penarth. In March 2014, brothers and amateur palaeontologists Nick and Rob Hanigan, while searching for ichthyosaur remains at Lavernock Point, a large cape south of Cardiff, found stone plates containing dinosaur fossils which had fallen off the high cliff face. Judith Adams and Philip Manning of the University of Manchester took X-ray pictures and CAT-scans of the fossils. The remains were donated to the Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales, and prepared by Craig Chivers and Gary Blackwell. In 2015, student Sam Davies found additional rock plates at the dig site, containing foot bones. The type species, Dracoraptor hanigani, was named and described in 2016 by British palaeontologists David Martill, Steven Vidovic, Cindy Howells, and John Nudds. The generic name combines the Latin draco, \\"dragon\\", a reference to the Welsh Dragon, with raptor, \\"robber\\". The specific name honours Nick and Rob Hanigan as discoverers. The holotype, NMW 2015.5G.1–2015.5G.11, was discovered in the lower Bull Cliff Member of the Blue Lias Formation in the United Kingdom. More precisely, it came from a layer just metres below the first occurrence of Jurassic ammonite Psiloceras and above the Paper Shales that represent the lithological Triassic-Jurassic boundary, precisely dating the dinosaur to the earliest Hettangian stage, 201.3 million years ago ± 0.2 million years. The holotype consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It contains both praemaxilla (frontmost upper jaw bones), both maxillae (main upper jaw bone), teeth, a lacrimal, a jugal, a postorbital, a squamosal, a supraoccipital, parts of the lower jaws, a possible hyoid, two cervical (neck) vertebrae (backbones), cervical ribs, rear dorsal (back) vertebrae, at least five front caudal (tail) vertebrae, chevrons, ribs, gastralia (or \\"belly ribs\\"), the lower parts of a left forelimb, a furcula (wishbone), both pubic bones, a left ischium (lower and rearmost hip bone), a right femur, a tibia (shin bone), the upper part of a fibula (calf bone), a left astragalus (ankle bone), three tarsals, and three metatarsals. About 40% of the skeleton is presented. Dracoraptor is thus the most complete Mesozoic non-bird theropod dinosaur known from Wales. Description alt= =Size and distinguishing traits= Dracoraptor was a biped, much like its relatives. The fossil discovered in Wales is a juvenile with a hip height of ; adults may have been long. In 2016, some autapomorphies (distinguishing traits) were established for Dracoraptor. The praemaxillae carried only three teeth, a basal trait. The jugal had a thin front branch running to the maxilla. The bony external nostril is large and had a thin branch beneath it. The pubic bone is obliquely directed to the front and is considerably longer than the ischium. The fourth tarsal had a process at the upper side. =Skeleton= Cervical vertebraealt=left In the front of the snout each praemaxilla embraces the front of a very large nostril. The skull bears three praemaxillary teeth per side and at least seven maxillary teeth. The teeth are recurved or dagger-shaped. The edges of the tooth crown are serrated with six to eight denticles per millimetre (0.03 in). On the trailing edge these serrations run all the way to the root, on the leading edge they end at a higher position. Towards the tip of the tooth, these denticles become gradually somewhat smaller. The maxilla borders an antorbital fenestra with a shallow depression. The jugal is a slender element with a straight lower edge, a thin front branch overlapped by the rear branch of the maxilla and an ascending process towards the lacrimal that is thin but not pointed. The lacrimal is rectangular and pinched in the middle. Hand elements and the alt= The neck vertebrae are elongated, opisthocoelous, i.e. with a vertebral body that is convex in front and concave at the rear, and crowned by low neural spines. Their undersides are slightly convex and their cross-sections are rectangular. At the front side the vertebral body is pierced by a pleurocoel, a depression with a pneumatic opening for the air sac to enter the inside of the vertebra. The tail vertebrae had two parallel keels at their undersides, which peter out towards the front. Their side processes are flat and broad. The presence of a furcula was reported. Furculae have only rarely been recovered from early theropod fossils; other examples include those of Segisaurus and Coelophysis. The lower arm bones, the ulna and the radius, had a length of about seven centimetres. Hand elements are present but a formula of the phalanges could not determined. In the pelvis, the pubic bone had a length of 212 millimetres. It points obliquely to the front. The pubic foot is moderately broadened in side view, bot at the front and at the rear. The shaft of the ischium is with a length of 129 millimetres markedly shorter than the pubic shaft. On the upper front edge a rectangular obturator process is present, forming a clear obturator notch with the ischial shaft. The shaft fan out to below, into an ischial foot. On the thighbone, the lesser trochanter had about two thirds of the height of the greater trochanter and is separated from it by a V-shaped cleft. A clear fourth trochanter is present. In the foot, the third metatarsal had a length of 116 millimetres. Classification restorationalt=left A cladistic analysis in 2016 determined that Dracoraptor was a basal member, positioned low in the evolutionary tree, of the Neotheropoda. It was the basalmost coelophysoid. The precise affinities of Dracoraptor are indicated by its various traits. The build of the pelvis shows it was a saurischian dinosaur. Among dinosaurs, the dagger-shaped transversely flattened teeth are only found with Theropoda. A membership of the clade Neotheropoda is proven by the shallow depression around the antorbital fenestra, the forward position of a pleurcoel on the neck vertebrae and the presence of an obturator notch in the ischium. The position in the Coelophysoidea is more uncertain. Dracoraptor does not clearly share many of the synapomorphies of the group, such as a rounded jugal branch towards the lacrimal. This accounts for its basal position in the analysis. Further preparation of the fossils might provide additional information about its phylogeny. Paleobiology Close up of a tooth At the end of the Triassic Period roughly half of Earth's species became extinct in the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event. This extinction event allowed dinosaurs to become the dominant land animals. The largest land predators at the end of the Triassic were Rauisuchia, large quadrupedal reptiles which disappeared in the extinction, paving the way for carnivorous dinosaurs to become the dominant land predators. Dracoraptor had pointed and serrated teeth, indicating it was a meat-eater. But the teeth were small, about one centimetre long, showing it ate small vertebrate animals. In the early Jurassic, South Wales was a coastal area with several small islands in a warm shallow sea. The area which is now Lavernock Point was offshore, so the cadaver of Dracoraptor had probably been washed into the sea from the land to the north. Despite the lack of data regarding its ecology, the authors in 2016 had it tentatively illustrated as a \\"shore-dwelling predator and scavenger\\". Dracoraptor is the oldest known Jurassic dinosaur. Vidovic stated: \\"So this dinosaur starts to fill in some gaps in our knowledge about the dinosaurs that survived the Triassic extinction and gave rise to all the dinosaurs that we know from Jurassic Park, books and TV\\" and \\"Dinosaurs diversified and populated the ecological niches in the Early Jurassic.\\" See also *2016 in paleontology References Category:Prehistoric neotheropods Category:Early Jurassic dinosaurs of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 2016 Category:Fossils of Wales ","title":"Dracoraptor"},{"id":"49181728","text":"Georissa filiasaulae is a species of a minute land snail that have an operculum, terrestrial gastropod mollusk in the family Hydrocenidae.

The Dominicans dug trenches on two hills blocking passage to Santiago and kept up single-shot fire against the automatic weapons of the Americans before the Americans drove them off. Joseph A. Glowin, a corporal, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery during the action. Background Triggered by concerns about possible German use of the Dominican Republic as a base for attacks on the United States during World War I, the US Government began a military occupation and administration of that country in 1916. Poorly armed Dominican rebels tried to take on the US Marines occupying the Dominican Republic in conventional battles. The first battle occurred at \\"Las Trincheras\\" (the trenches), a defensive position that the Dominicans called \\"Verdun.\\" The Marines used field artillery to bomb the trenches, machine guns positioned behind the troops to suppress the rifle fire of the rebels, and then quick bayonet rushes to rout the rebels from the trenches. The Marines sustained five dead. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods. Battle The Americans marched on Santiago City, a hotbed for the resistance. Colonel Pendelton's unit came under fire from Dominican soldiers and battle began. However, the Americans advancing on the Dominican positions did not record any injuries during the initial action. To aid the US Marines under fire, Cpl. Glowin fired his machine-gun and was only pulled out of battle when forced to, a brave action that decorated him with the USA's greatest military award the Medal of Honor. After his evacuation, Sergeant Roswell Winans brought up more machine-gun positions to fight off the enemy. This gave the Dominicans more targets to fire at. The captain in charge of the pit was killed and the others wounded. Winans was awarded a medal as well, for firing a Colt machine-gun at the enemy even when it was jammed. Soon, two more gun positions were formed and the Dominicans fled. The 27th and 29th divisions gave chase and killed the enemy commander, routing the Dominican rebels.

She was a member of the Vanderbilt family, and mother of music producer John Hammond. She was a keen musician and was president of numerous charitable societies. Biography Emily Vanderbilt (1933) Photo by Carl Van Vechten Emily Vanderbilt Sloane was born on September 17, 1874 to Emily Thorn Vanderbilt (1852–1946) and W. & J. Sloane heir William Douglas Sloane (1844–1915). She was the granddaughter of William Henry Vanderbilt. She was raised in New York, and summered at Elm Court, a mammoth shingle-style cottage in Lenox, Massachusetts. Uninterested in the débutante social circles of her peers, she preferred playing the piano at Sunday school. She took a keen interest in religion, delivering small sermons to her brothers and sisters, and later considered her faith important to mask the guilt of being born into a wealthy family. As an adult, Emily regularly attended opera and public lectures, and employed a social secretary. She disliked alcohol and tobacco and forbade either of them to be consumed in her house. Philanthropy Vanderbilt Sloane was enthusiastic about donating money to good causes and social demands. She was a supporter of educationalist Martha Berry and made many financial contributions to Berry College; correspondence between the two women was later made public. A major activity of hers was the restoration of the Theodore Roosevelt House at 28 East 20th Street. She was president of the Women's Roosevelt Memorial Association for many years. She was president of the Home Thrift Association, supporting a Yorkville settlement house, and was president for 43 years of the Three Arts Club, a residence for women studying music, painting and drama. She was a founder of the Parents' League of New York in 1914, and later became its president. She was the president of the Peoples' Chorus of New York, and a commissioner of the Girl Scouts of Westchester County. After her husband's death in 1949, she donated the family's 277-acre Mount Kisco estate, Dellwood, to the controversial Moral Rearmament movement. Residence John Henry Hammond House, home of Emily Vanderbilt Sloane Hammond Emily's parents commissioned the architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings to design a mansion for the couple at 9 East 91st, on land purchased from Andrew Carnegie; it was known as the John Henry Hammond House. The house has since been restored and is now the Consulate General of the Russian Federation. The reception rooms on the second floor – a ballroom, library and music room – routinely sat three hundred guests, at concerts often featuring Vanderbilt Sloane on piano, and her son John Hammond, Jr. playing violin or viola. Many greats of jazz played in the house, including Benny Goodman Rachel Hammond Breck noted that her mother's parties never went for long, mainly due to her refusal to serve alcohol. Personal life On April 5, 1899, she married John Henry Hammond I at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church. He was the brother of Ogden H. Hammond, U.S. Ambassador to Spain.Note: Dunstan Prial's book incorrectly has their marriage as April 7, 1899 Together, they had four children: * Adele Sloane Hammond (1902–1998), who married John K.

Three Swedish Navy destroyers were berthed in Hårsfjärden fjord near Stockholm when the torpedoes or oil tanks of HSwMS Göteborg exploded; flames then also enveloped and in an inferno. The three destroyers were sunk, and thirty-three sailors killed, a major blow to the Swedish Navy. All three ships were later raised.

It is a Grade I listed building. The hall is constructed of limestone to an E-plan in two storeys with attics, and boasts a slender 4-storey tower in one of the internal corners. In the ornamental gardens are stables and an early monastic dovecote, which is a Grade II* listed building. Close by stands the 12th century Church of St James. History Dovecote After the Dissolution of the Monasteries Shipton manor had been granted by the Crown in 1548 to Sir Thomas Palmer, after whose attainder and execution for high treason in 1553 it was resold by the Crown in 1557. After passing through several hands it eventually (1580) came into the possession of John Lutwyche. The present house was originally built around 1587 for Richard Lutwyche to replace an older timber framed house which had burned down. The decayed church of St James was also rebuilt by the Lutwyches in 1589 and is now a Grade II* listed building. Richard Lutwyche later gave the estate to Thomas Mytton as a dowry when Mytton married Lutwyche's daughter and it thereafter descended in the Mytton family until 1795, when it passed by marriage to the local More family. In the late 1800s the Mores sold the Hall to the great-grandfather of the present owner. John Nicholas Bishop of Shipton Hall was High Sheriff of Shropshire in 2002. The Hall was greatly rebuilt in the Georgian style in the mid-18th century, when the roccoco interior decor was created by architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, designer of the Coalbrookdale Iron Bridge.

He was known for the miracle of the levitation of the host during a Mass he celebrated in Rome on the occasion of his participation in the Fourth Council of the Lateran. He was born in Amsheet, a village near Byblos, the ancient Phoenician city. Very pious since his young age, he lived in a hermitage in his village, in a cell near the Saint-Zakhia church (then known as \\"the Holy Zakhia churches\\" because they were three small churches, very old, dating to the fifth century). His brothers helped in the development of these hermitages. After a period in the hermitage in his hometown, he went to another hermitage, Mayfouk, to the convent of Our Lady Of Ilige. The Maronite tradition has a custom of choosing patriarchs from among hermits. He was elected patriarch of the Maronite Church, following the death of Patriarch Peter IV (بطرس الرابع). Amshitti chose for the first patriarchal seat, Yanouh (يانوح). Known for his devotion, he was invited to Rome by Pope Innocent III to participate in the IV Council of the Lateran. The Patriarch Jeremiah Amshitti was working to consolidate the Maronite faith in union with the Catholic Church.

She also contributed to archaeological excavations. She was President of Société Préhistorique Française, following her work at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique. Her two most famous works are the discovery of the \\"flower burial\\" in Shanidar 4 tomb, and the analysis of Ramses II's mummy.  Early life and education  Leroi-Gourhan was born Arlette Royer on 9 January 1913 in Paris, to a family of wealthy manufacturers. As a child she partook in sports and arts, as well as travelling throughout Europe and Northern Africa. She studied at École du Louvre, and later École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS). At EHESS, she met André Leroi-Gourhan. Royer and Leroi- Gourhan married in 1936, and travelled to Japan the following year when André took up a two-year position funded by the Government of Japan.  Career  Leroi-Gourhan focused her research on paleobotany, a non-existent field of study at the time. She wrote some 180 papers on the subject and associated topics between 1956 and 2002, some 35 of which were co-written with her husband or/and other scientists. She started a laboratory at Musée de l'Homme, which focused on the analysis of pollen.

William Schuman composed the music. Charles Hyman designed the original set, which was replaced almost immediately by one conceived by Isamu Noguchi. He also added jewelry and a headdress. Jean Rosenthal provided the lighting. The piece premiered on January 4, 1950, at the Columbia Auditorium in Louisville, Kentucky.Belfy, Jeanne Marie. (1991). Judith and the Louisville Orchestra: The Rest of the Story. College Music Symposium 31. College Music Society: 36–48. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40374124. Concept and theme The idea for a \\"dance concerto\\" was proposed by Louise Kain, a patroness of the arts and a board member of the Louisville Philharmonic Society. She suggested Graham perform with the musicians in the manner of a musical concerto, with the dancer replacing the solo instrument. The plan was met with enthusiasm by all parties. Taken from the deuterocanonical books of the Bible (Apocrypha), the ballet is a dance dramatization of the story of Judith, the Hebrew widow who saves the city of Bethulia by seducing and beheading the invading Assyrian tyrant Holofernes.Franko, Mark. (2012). Martha Graham in Love and War: The Life in the Work. Oxford University Press. . Synopsis and musical structure In 1949, Graham turned to William Schuman for the score. They had collaborated two years earlier on the highly successful Night Journey. The music and dance advance in five uninterrupted movements. Graham performed in front of the orchestra, which was partially obscured behind a translucent panel. *I. Adagio - The piece opens with a dark adagio featuring muted strings punctuated by occasional solo woodwind and harsh brass. The section represents the plight of the Israelites, suffering and dying of thirst as Holofernes lays siege to their city. (Book of Judith 1-7:32, 4:40 minutes) *II. Moderato - Judith prepares to enter the enemy camp. Her anxious resolve is reflected in the music, which increases in intensity, culminating with strings and brass in a spirited jazz-inspired interplay. (Book of Judith 8.1-10.10, 3:25 minutes) *III. Tranquillo - A peaceful solo oboe passage followed by one for solo violin accompany Judith's prayers for guidance and her patient wait for a chance to confront Holofernes. (2:07 minutes) *IV. Presto - The presto movement heightens the action in Holofernes tent, where Judith seduces the drunken general. The scene opens with rumbling timpani and accelerates with pizzicato strings. The beheading, which takes place behind a curtain in the choreography, is marked by frenzied repetitive brass chords that slowly fade away. (5:54 minutes) *V. Andante (Coda)- Judith's slow procession homeward carrying Holofernes' head. The music is measured and dignified rather than victorious.(Book of Judith 13:19, 3:04 minutes) Background notes Graham created Judith at a pivotal point in her personal life. She had sustained a serious knee injury during the troupe's European tour that forced her to cancel all remaining performances. At the same time her husband and dance partner Erick Hawkins had asked for a divorce. Stuart Hodes wrote the dance manifested \\"Martha's uncanny way of anticipating the big changes in her life,\\" adding a quote attributed to Pearl Lang, \\"Martha had to make that dance so she could cut off Erick's head!\\" Judith was the first of Graham's biblical heroines and a departure from her myth-derived works. In a letter to Schuman, she wrote, \\"I do not want to make this in any way inhuman or goddess-like.\\" She went on to make two subsequent dances based on the Hebrew heroine, Legend of Judith (1962) and Judith (1980). Graham designed a series of costumes for the 1950 solo to convey Judith's transformation and evolving state of mind. \\"The dresses which constitute the garments for the various parts will be on the stage arranged as part of the scene itself. They will be in color and will be replaced as I see it when she finished with them as though they were to wait to be worn by someone else.\\" Following the murder, Judith dons a blood red cloak. Noguchi's three-legged balsa wood set consisted of stylized weapon- like elements, two crossed pieces resembling spears and an arrow-shaped member, supporting a fourth horizontal component evocative of an open-mouthed viper. The thick coil that makes up Judith's bracelet is also serpentine in nature, while the headpiece suggests rams' horns. Critical reception Judith debuted to a sold-out house that included nationally known music critics. Time and Newsweek, as well as the New York and local papers ran feature articles on Graham and Schuman's achievement. \\"A triumphant success…a new form for the theatre…the dance concerto…,\\" wrote Robert Sabin. \\"The two artists worked in close and careful collaboration, having benefited by their labors on Night Journey. The result is a theatre piece in which dance and movement are fused in seamless unity.\\" Two decades later and in spite of his artistic competition with her, Erick Hawkins praised Judith as \\"a magnificent work.\\" References Category:Ballets by Martha Graham Category:1950 ballet premieres Category:Arts in Louisville, Kentucky Category:Ballets with sets by Isamu Noguchi ","title":"Judith (ballet)"},{"id":"49182202","text":"Nesthäkchen und ihre Küken (English:Nesthäkchen and Her Chicks) is the seventh volume of the ten-book Nesthäkchen series by Else Ury. This volume was published in 1923. Nesthäkchen is Annemarie Braun, a Berlin doctor's daughter, a slim, golden blond, quintessential German girl. The series follows Annemarie from infancy (Nesthäkchen and Her Dolls) to old age and grandchildren (Nesthäkchen with White Hair).Jennifer Redmann. Nostalgia and Optimism in Else Ury's \\"Nesthäkchen\\" Books for Young Girls in the Weimar Republic. The German Quarterly, Vol. 79, No. 4 (Fall, 2006), pp. 465-483 Nesthäkchen und ihre Küken describes Anne Marie's early years of motherhood. Plot summary In this novel the plot has advanced beyond the year during which Else Ury was writing, 1923. Strictly speaking, Ury is describing the future. Annemarie Braun was born 9 April 1903, and married at 20; she could thus in 1930 be celebrating her seventh wedding anniversary, which occurs in the book. In order to continue the series, Else Ury extended the middle 1920s milieu of her fifth and sixth Nesthäkchen volumes for another half-century. Time stands still, but the characters age. Therefore, Annemarie’s life no longer unfolds, as in the first six books, in an actual historical period. \\"Nesthäkchen and Her Chicks\\" begins with Anne Marie and Rudolf's seventh wedding anniversary. The two now have three children, the six-year Vronli, the three-year old Hans and two-year old Ursel, and live in Berlin-Lichterfelde. Anne Marie's parents, \\"Omama\\" and \\"Opapa\\" are now beloved grandparents, her grandmother the \\"Urmütterchen\\" and Aunt Albertina the \\"Urtantchen\\" of Annemarie’s children. Brother Hans is a magistrate married to Rudolf's sister Ola, with two sons, Herbert and Waldemar. Klaus is a farmer, still a bachelor, who is enamored of Annemarie’s girlfriend Ilse Hermann. Ilse and Marlene Ulrich, the inseparable cousins, are teachers at a girls' school. Margot and Vera are unmarried and employed, Margot as head of a dressmaking firm and Vera as a photographer. Anne Marie's daughter Vronli starts school. On this day the children Hans and Ursel are alone in the house and find Father’s matches. Hans starts a fire. The house burns down and the homeless family finds shelter with their neighbors, the lonely, old, but child-loving bachelor Mr. Pfefferkorn and his grumpy housekeeper Mrs. Luebke. Subsequently Annemarie and the children move in with her parents. Financial worries torment Annemarie and Rudolf, and Annemarie has the desire to earn money to help her husband. She is unable to carry out this plan. (Else Ury is alluding to the economic misery caused by the Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic between June 1921 and January 1924.) In winter the children become seriously ill with the flu, but recover. \\"Urmütterchens\\" seventieth birthday is celebrated (the author has apparently overlooked the fact that grandmother has already celebrated her seventieth birthday in volume 3). \\"Urtantchen\\" dies soon afterward. In summer, Annemarie travels with her children, Ilse and Marlene, to visit her brother Klaus in the Pomeranian countryside. They live at his estate, Lüttgenheide, on the Baltic Sea, nearby Cousin Peter on Grotgenheide. The story ends with the betrothal of Klaus to Ilse and Peter to Marlene. In the first editions of the book, Else Ury adds an epilogue in which she states that she hesitated to continue the Nesthäkchen series, but was finally moved to do so by the many letters of her young readers. This volume was modernized after World War II. Originally Annemarie sometimes spanks her children, but does not do so in the post-war editions. Genre Else Ury, 1915 The Nesthäkchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12 – 16 years old. A Backfisch (“teenage girl”, literally “fish for frying”) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesthäkchen series with volume 6, Nesthäkchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesthäkchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesthäkchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesthäkchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesthäkchen and Her Chicks. Author Else Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin; January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best-known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesthäkchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesthäkchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

Students are given 18 months to complete each course and are able to work at their own pace. The courses are housed in Brightspace by D2L, an integrated learning platform developed in Waterloo, Ontario. They are written by certified teachers and presented entirely online. VHS holds Ontario Student Records for students who attend VHS full-time and plan to earn their Ontario Secondary School Diplomas at VHS.  History  Virtual High School is the oldest online high school in Ontario. Using Notepad, Baker constructed the first course, grade 11 biology, in 1995. This course was available to the public via the Internet. The second course, Canadian Literature, became available in early 1996. On January 2, 1997, this online school was moved to the VirtualHighSchool.com domain. The original courses were organized using a rudimentary learning management system that Baker created. Baker applied to the Ontario Ministry of Education to be recognized as an accredited private school. In April 2003, VHS became an inspected private school able to grant OSSD credits with the BSID # 665681. At this time, VHS was named Kitchener- Waterloo Private School, as the idea of a virtual high school might not be readily accepted just yet. In 2012, VHS moved its headquarters to its current location in Bayfield, Ontario. The building is an 1880s-era hotel that has served various purposes since its inception. The presence of the building goes back to 1853 but it was torn down in the 1880s and replaced by the Queen's hotel. In 1940, it was repurchased and renamed the Ritz Hotel. The rebirth into the VHS headquarters was a $2-million privately funded project that filled the building with modern computer and communication technology. In 2012-2013, VHS's 64 courses drew 5414 students to enroll. By 2015, VHS had 71 courses.

On the 1457 Genoese map there is an island of Candia, with a report of a \\"large fish\\" being captured and brought back to Venice. It can be found on Martin Behaim's globe in 1492, where he described it as being: \\"foot against foot with respect to our land, and when it is day with us they have night\\" (in other words, in the antipodes).

The initial landings were met with some resistance from both the Order and the Maltese militia, but in less than a day the French had taken control of the entire Maltese archipelago except for the well-fortified harbour area that included the capital Valletta. The Order had the means to withstand a siege, but a series of circumstances including discontent among its own French members as well as the native Maltese population led to a truce which ended with the capitulation of the Order. The invasion therefore ended the 268-year-long Hospitaller rule in Malta, and it resulted in the French occupation of Malta. A few months after the invasion, discontent due to reforms that were taking place led to an uprising, which evolved into a blockade of the French garrison by Maltese insurgents aided by the British, Neapolitans and Portuguese. The blockade lasted for two years, and ended with the French surrendering to the British in 1800, making Malta a protectorate and initiating 164 years of British rule. Background Letter dated 19 April 1798 written by Napoleon instructing General Louis Desaix to set sail from Civitavecchia and meet up with him at Malta During the 18th century, the Order of St. John began to decline as its function of fighting the Muslims became outdated. It came to rely on France, which was an important source of revenue, and the majority of the Order's members were French. The Order received major setbacks following the French Revolution, and by 1792 there were serious financial difficulties. Meanwhile, France and the other major European powers began to take an interest in Malta due to its strategic position in the central Mediterranean and its system of fortifications, which was one of the strongest in Europe. By March 1798, the Order had received information that the French were amassing armaments in Toulon. However, it was believed that they were being prepared for an attack on Portugal and Ireland, and Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim did not believe that an attack on Malta was imminent. Hompesch might have been informed of the attack on 4 June, although the authenticity of the document in question has been disputed. Invasion=6–9 June: Arrival of the French fleet and ultimatum= Painting of Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, the last Grand Master to rule Malta The French fleet was sighted off Gozo on 6 June, and Hompesch summoned a council of war and called out the militia. Maltese soldiers and militia led by members of the Order were responsible for the defence of the fortified cities in the Grand Harbour area: Valletta, Floriana, Birgu, Senglea and Cospicua. The other settlements and coastline were to be defended by the country militia and some knights including members of the Order's navy. Meanwhile, the French had made preparations for landing and occupying the Maltese Islands. On 9 June, Napoleon sent his aide-de-camp Jean- Andoche Junot to request permission from the Grand Master for the French fleet to water at Malta. Hompesch called a Council meeting to discuss whether to allow them or not, and it was decided to only allow four ships at a time to enter the harbours. This was in accordance with an old statute which forbade entry to more than four ships of Christian countries to enter Maltese ports at once during periods of hostilities. On 10 June, Napoleon dictated an ultimatum which was written and signed by Caruson, and it was delivered to Hompesch. The message mentioned Napoleon's disappointment at the Order's refusal to allow more French ships to enter the harbours, and it mentioned the considerable French forces and the futility of any resistance. The letter further asked Hompesch to conclude an arrangement so as to avoid hostilities. It stated that the French were treating the Order as an enemy, but it promised to respect the religion, customs and property of the Maltese population. =10 June: French landings and initial resistance= On the morning of 10 June, the French began landing their forces at four different locations of the Maltese Islands: St. Paul's Bay, St. Julian's and Marsaxlokk on mainland Malta and the area around Ramla Bay on Gozo. Landing at St. Paul's Bay The landing in St. Paul's Bay in northern Malta was undertaken by troops commanded by Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers. The Maltese offered some resistance, but they were quickly forced to surrender. The French managed to capture all the fortifications commanding St. Paul's Bay and nearby Mellieħa without any casualties. The defenders' casualties consisted of a knight and a Maltese soldier being killed, and around 150 knights and Maltese being captured. Landing at Marsaxlokk Fort Rohan, which fell to the French after some resistance A force commanded by Louis Desaix landed at Marsaxlokk, a large bay in southern Malta. The landing was successful, and the French managed to capture Fort Rohan after some resistance. Following the capture of the fort, the defenders abandoned the other coastal fortifications in the bay, and the French landed the bulk of their forces unopposed. Landing at St. Julian's and capture of Mdina Forces led by Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois landed at St. Julian's and the surrounding area. A galley, two galleots and a chaloup of the Order's navy sailed out of the Grand Harbour in an attempt to prevent the landing, but their effort was futile. Three battalions of the 4th Light Infantry and two battalions of the 19th of the Line landed, and were met by some companies of the Maltese Regiment who offered token resistance before retreating to Valletta. The French forces surrounded the city, being joined by Desaix's troops who had made a successful landing at Marsaxlokk. The Hospitaller defenders then attempted a counterattack and sent out troops against the French, who began to retreat. The Hospitallers and Maltese advanced, but were ambushed by a battalion of the 19th of the Line and were thrown into disarray. The French then began a general advance, and the defenders retreated back to the fortified city. The flag of the Order at the head of the defending force was captured by the French. With Valletta surrounded, Vaubois led some of the troops to the old city of Mdina, where the remaining militia had retreated following the landings. At a city council meeting at the Bishop's Palace, it was decided that resistance was futile and they agreed to capitulate if the people's religion, liberty and property would be respected. By about 12.00, the terms had been agreed and the city capitulated to Vaubois. Landing and capture of Gozo The Sopu Tower, which was located close to the landing site and offered some resistance to the invasion The French force which landed on the island of Gozo consisted of the 3rd Company of Grenadiers and the 95th Demi-Brigade, and it was led by Jean Reynier. accompanied Reynier and took part in the attack. Gozo was defended by a total of 2300 men, consisting of a company of 300 regular troops (30 of whom were mounted), a regiment of 1200 coastguardsmen and 800 militia. The landing began at around 13.00 in the area of Redum Kebir () in the vicinity of Nadur, between the Ramla Right Battery and the Sopu Tower. The defenders opened fire on the French, and they were aided by artillery from the batteries at Ramla and the Sopu Tower. French bombards returned fire to the batteries, and the French managed to advance to higher ground despite heavy fire. The batteries at Ramla were taken, and the French managed to land the rest of their troops. Casualties among the invading force included Sergeant-Major Bertrand, who was killed by gunfire during the landing. Reynier and part of the 95th Demi-Brigade subsequently marched to Fort Chambray which commanded Gozo's main harbour, Mġarr, in an attempt to cut off communication with Malta. The fort had been filled with refugees from the surrounding villages, and it capitulated at around 14.00. Meanwhile, the rest of the 95th Demi-Brigade marched through Xagħra to the Cittadella in the island's capital Rabat. A detachment occupied the Marsalforn Tower. The Cittadella surrendered by nightfall. The French captured around 116 artillery pieces, 44 of which were in the Cittadella, 22 at Chambray and the remainder in the various coastal fortifications. Muskets and three stores of wheat were also captured. =10–12 June: Situation in the harbour area= Fort Tigné, which attempted to resist the French invasion and was heavily bombarded in the process Following the successful landings, there was widespread commotion, confusion and discontent in Valletta and the Cottonera. The Grand Master and the Council remained assembled at the Palace, together with a number of other knights. The clergy organised processions with the statue of Saint Paul, praying for mercy. Two Frenchmen who were in the city were murdered on the suspicion that they were involved in the invasion. There were fears that the prisoners of the Slaves' Prison would rise in revolt. Fears of a Maltese uprising against the Order increased after two young knights were murdered in the Cottonera. Within the city, there were factions who supported the French and others who opposed them. Some of the French members of the Order had Republican leanings and supported Napoleon. Jean de Bosredon de Ransijat, a Commander and Grand Cross of the Order who was also the Secretary of the Treasury, was imprisoned in Fort St. Angelo after he addressed a letter to Hompesch stating that he will not fight the French and asking to remain neutral in the conflict. Some pressured Hompesch to negotiate with Napoleon and come to terms of peace, and Maltese representatives petitioned the Grand Master to reach an armistice. Meanwhile, the fortifications of the harbour area continued to resist the invasion. Fort Ricasoli and Fort Manoel withstood a number of attacks and they only surrendered after the Order's capitulation had been signed. The French blockaded Fort Tigné and bombarded it repeatedly on 11 and 12 June, and its defenders were unaware of the negotiations that were taking place at the time. The defending garrison abandoned Tigné on the night of 12–13 June, and the French took control soon afterwards. =11–12 June: Negotiations and capitulation= Engraving depicting Malta's capitulation to Napoleon The Council eventually decided to ask for a truce. The Monsieur de Fremaux, the consul of the Batavian Republic, was initially chosen to bear a letter to the French asking for a truce. Due to Fremaux' old age, Monsieur Mélan, a member of his staff, was sent instead, and he arrived on the French flagship L'Orient at 09.00 on 11 June. Mélan returned with a verbal message that Napoleon would send an envoy, and around 12.00 General Junot arrived with a small delegation. He was joined by a number of knights of the Order who were sympathetic to the French, including Ransijat who had been freed following his brief imprisonment. Hompesch and members of the State Congregation received the envoys, and they agreed on a 24-hour ceasefire during which negotiations would continue on board L'Orient. On 12 June, Napoleon and representatives of the Order and the Maltese signed a convention in which the Order capitulated Valletta and the Maltese Islands' fortifications and ceded sovereignty of the islands to the French. The French promised to acquire a principality for the Grand Master as compensation for the loss of Malta. They promised to respect the private property of individual knights and the Maltese. Pensions were also granted to the Grand Master and the French knights, and a promise to secure similar pensions for knights from the Cisalpine, Roman, Ligurian and Helvetic Republics was also made. The agreement stated that Fort Manoel, Fort Tigné, Fort St. Angelo, the fortifications of Birgu and Senglea, the Santa Margherita Lines and the Cottonera Lines were to be surrendered to the French by 12.00 of 12 June. The fortifications of Valletta, the Floriana Lines, Fort Saint Elmo, Fort Ricasoli and the remaining fortifications were to be surrendered by 12.00 of the following day. The Order's navy was to be transferred to a French officer by 12 June. By 12–13 June, the French had taken control of the entire island and its fortifications. They also captured approximately 1200 artillery pieces, 40000 muskets, of gunpowder, two ships of the line, a frigate and four galleys of the Order. Aftermath Palazzo Parisio in Valletta, where Napoleon stayed for a couple of days after the invasion Following the capture of Malta, Napoleon landed at Valletta on 13 June. He stayed on the island for six days, spending the first night at the Banca Giuratale and later staying at Palazzo Parisio, before most of the French fleet embarked for the campaign in Egypt. General Vaubois remained on the island with a garrison in order to maintain control, thereby establishing the French occupation of Malta. During his short stay, Napoleon dictated instructions which radically reformed the Maltese government and society, so as to bring it in line with French Republican ideals. A few days after the capitulation, the Grand Master and many knights left the island, taking with them few movable possessions including some relics and icons. The Order received shelter from Paul I of Russia, who was eventually proclaimed Grand Master by some knights. The Order gradually evolved into the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which still exists today and has sovereignty but no territory. Most of the Maltese were initially glad at the expulsion of the Order and were sympathetic to the French, but this opinion changed after the French refused to pay the Order's debts, introduced new taxes, refused to pay pensions, introduced laws restricting the privileges of the Church and began to loot from churches. Within three months, the Maltese rose up against the occupiers, and took control of most of the islands with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese assistance. The French garrison in Valletta and the Cottonera withstood the ensuing blockade for two years, before Vaubois surrendered to the British in 1800, making Malta a protectorate and initiating 164 years of British rule.

It can also be described as metadata, data placement and data management software that lets organizations manage unstructured data on multiple storage devices located anywhere in the world in order to orchestrate global data intensive workflows, and search for and locate data no matter where it is located or when it was created. Nirvana does this by capturing system and user-defined metadata to enable detailed search and enact policies to control data movement and protection. Nirvana also maintains data provenance, audit, security and access control. Nirvana can reduce storage costs by identifying data to be moved to lower cost storage and data that no longer needs to be stored. History Nirvana is the result of research started in 1995 at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) (which was founded by and run at the time by General Atomics), in response to a DARPA sponsored project for a Massive Data Analysis System. Led by General Atomics computational plasma physicist Dr. Reagan Moore, development continued through the cooperative efforts of General Atomics and the SDSC on the Storage Resource Broker (SRB), with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF). SRB 1.1 was delivered in 1998, (Reprint from November 30 – December 3, 1998) demonstrating a logical distributed file system with a single Global Namespace across geographically distributed storage systems. In 2003, General Atomics turned over operation of the SDSC to the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and Dr. Moore became a full-time professor there establishing the Data Intensive Computing Environments (DICE) Center, continuing development of SRB. In that same year, General Atomics acquired the exclusive license to develop a commercial version of SRB, calling it Nirvana. The DICE team ended development of SRB in 2006 and started a rules oriented data management project called iRODS for open source distribution. Dr. Moore and his DICE team relocated to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where iRODS is now maintained by the iRODS Consortium. General Atomics continued development of Nirvana at their San Diego headquarters, focusing on capabilities to serve government and commercial users, including high scalability, fail-over, performance, implementation, maintenance and support. In 2009, General Atomics won a data management contract with the US Department of Defense (DOD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program. The requirements of this contract focused General Atomics to expand Nirvana’s performance, scalability, security and ease of use. A major deliverable involved integrating Nirvana with Oracle Corporation's SAM-QFS filesystem to provide a policy-based Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system with near real-time event synchronization. General Atomics also announced that digital marketing firm infoGROUP deployed Nirvana to create a Global Name Space across three of infoGROUP’s computer operations centers in the Omaha area. In 2012, General Atomics released Nirvana version 4.3. In 2014, General Atomics changed the Nirvana business model from a large government contract, fee for service model, to a standard commercial software model. In 2015, General Atomics initiated a strategic relationship with Pixit Media/ArcaStream in the United Kingdom, integrating Nirvana with Pixit Media and ArcaStream’s products. In 2016, General Atomics released Nirvana version 5.0.

System and user-defined metadata can be used to search for a file or object (or groups of files and objects) and also control access to and move those files and objects from one storage resource to another. The MCAT creates a single Global Namespace across all Storage Resources connected to it so users and administrators can search for, access, and move data across multiple heterogeneous storage systems from multiple vendors across geographically dispersed data centers. The MCAT is connected to and interacts with a relational database management system to support its operation. Multiple MCATs can be deployed for horizontal scale-out and failover. Various Clients can interact with Nirvana including the supplied Web browser and Java based GUI Clients, a Command Line Interface, a native Windows virtual network drive interface, and user-developed applications via supplied APIs. Nirvana operation is controlled by three daemons; Metadata, Sync and ILM. The Metadata Daemon can extract metadata automatically from an instrument creating data, from within the file's actual data using predefined and customizable templates and metadata parsing policies, or capturing user input via the GUI or Command Line Interface. The Sync Daemon, running in the background, detects when files are added to, or deleted from, the underlying Storage Resource filesystems. When filesystem changes are observed by the Sync Daemon, the changes are registered and updated in MCAT. The ILM Daemon routinely queries the MCAT and executes actions including migration, replication, or backup on a specified schedule. For example, an administrator can set a policy to free up space on an expensive primary storage system by migrating that data to distributed retention locations based on criteria such as: storage consumption watermarks (percent full), all data associated with a specific project, or data that hasn't been accessed in over one year. The policies are extremely flexible. User-defined metadata attributes (e.g. Project, Principal investigator, Data source, Location, Temperature, etc.) can also be used to move data. Nirvana ILM policy execution occurs behind the scenes, transparent to end-users or applications.  Use Cases = Data Aware Cloud Storage Gateway = Nirvana's ILM functionality can be used as a Cloud Storage Gateway, where data stored locally, on premises, can be moved to popular cloud storage services based on Nirvana's various metadata attributes and policies. In 2015, General Atomics and ArcaStream announced a Cloud Storage Appliance that uses IBM's Spectrum Scale for on premises storage and integrates with cloud storage providers Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage. = Advanced Search = Nirvana can be used to conduct search queries to find data of interest using both system and user-defined metadata. Queries are either entered in the Command Line Interface or through the Web browser client shown below. = Virtual Collections = Nirvana can automate the grouping and distribution of data files into a virtual collection - based on user-friendly logical rules. For example, user-defined metadata can be used to identify data files needing to be transferred between collaborators with domain-specific attributes (experiment, study, project, etc.). = Data Provenance = In many fields, it is helpful to know the provenance and processing pipeline used to produce derived results. Nirvana tracks data within workflows, through all transformations, analyses, and interpretations. With Nirvana, data can be shared and used with verified provenance of the conditions under which it was generated – so results are reproducible and analyzable for defects. = Audit = Nirvana can be used to audit every transaction on a data file within a workflow. An audit trail can be stored containing information such as date of transaction, success or error code, user performing transaction, type of transaction and notes, etc. Audit trails, like everything else with Nirvana, can be easily queried and filtered. = Security and Access Control = Nirvana can be used to control access to data by setting up specific access control lists by user, group etc. using user-defined metadata attributes (Project, Study, etc.) and by setting access privilege levels where users assigned higher levels can see more information than others assigned lower levels. Nirvana supports single sign-on and access by integrating with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Active Directory, using Challenge-response authentication, Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), and Kerberos. Data can only be viewed and modified by users authorized to do so. = File System Analysis = Nirvana can be used to analyze the makeup of a shared filesystem to determine what type of data is being stored, how much space it takes up, when it was last accessed, and who stored it. With this information, storage administrators can determine the most appropriate type of storage system to use and when to move unused data to lower cost archive storage. In the example below, Nirvana's analysis of data stored on an expensive enterprise NAS storage system showed most data hadn't been accessed in over 2 years. The analysis further showed that most files were very small, and over half the storage was consumed by just two users. Using this data, the organization replaced their enterprise storage system with less expensive object storage to better manage the many small, seldom accessed, files.

Music technology is the study or the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform music; to compose, notate, play back or record songs or pieces; or to analyze or edit music. The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes. Ancient Egyptians developed stringed instruments, such as harps, lyres and lutes, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings. Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as double clarinets and percussion instruments such as cymbals. In Ancient Greece, instruments included the double-reed aulos and the lyre. Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the horn, pipe, lyre, harp, and bagpipe. During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used. During the Middle Ages, music notation was used to create a written record of the notes of plainchant melodies. During the Renaissance music era (c. 1400-1600), the printing press was invented, allowing for sheet music to be mass-produced (previously having been hand-copied). This helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. During the Baroque era (c. 1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and the development of a new keyboard instrument in approximately 1700, the piano. In the Classical era, Beethoven added new instruments to the orchestra such as the piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his Ninth Symphony. During the Romantic music era (c. 1810–1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. In the 19th century, new instruments such as saxophones, euphoniums, Wagner tubas, and cornets were added to the orchestra. Around the turn of the 20th century, with the invention and popularization of the gramophone record (commercialized in 1892), and radio broadcasting (starting on a commercial basis ca. 1919-1920), there was a vast increase in music listening, and it was easier to distribute music to a wider public. The development of sound recording had a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The invention of sound recording also gave rise to a new sub genre of classical music: the Musique concrete style of electronic composition. The invention of multitrack recording enabled pop bands to overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. In the early 20th century, electric technologies such as electromagnetic pickups, amplifiers and loudspeakers were used to develop new electric instruments such as the electric piano (1929), electric guitar (1931), electro-mechanical organ (1934) and electric bass (1935). The 20th-century orchestra gained new instruments and new sounds. Some orchestra pieces used the electric guitar, electric bass or the Theremin. The invention of the miniature transistor in 1947 enabled the creation of a new generation of synthesizers, which were used first in pop music in the 1960s. Unlike prior keyboard instrument technologies, synthesizer keyboards do not have strings, pipes, or metal tines. A synthesizer keyboard creates musical sounds using electronic circuitry, or, later, computer chips and software. Synthesizers became popular in the mass market in the early 1980s. With the development of powerful microchips, a number of new electronic or digital music technologies were introduced in the 1980s and subsequent decades, including drum machines and music sequencers. Electronic and digital music technologies are any device, such as a computer, an electronic effects unit or software, that is used by a musician or composer to help make or perform music. The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, computer hardware and computer software that is used in the performance, playback, recording, composition, sound recording and reproduction, mixing, analysis and editing of music. Mechanical technologies=Prehistoric eras= A bone flute which is over 41,000 years old. Findings from paleolithic archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found Paleolithic flutes carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven- holed flute and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from the Indus Valley Civilization archaeological sites.The Music of India By Reginald MASSEY, Jamila MASSEY. Google Books India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world—references to Indian classical music (marga) are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition. The earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in China and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 BC. =Ancient Egypt= Musicians of Amun, 18th Dynasty (c. 1543–1292 BC) In prehistoric Egypt, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals, and small shells were used as whistles. Evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, when funerary chants played an important role in Egyptian religion and were accompanied by clappers and possibly the flute. The most reliable evidence of instrument technologies dates from the Old Kingdom, when technologies for constructing harps, flutes and double clarinets were developed.Music of Ancient Egypt . Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Percussion instruments, lyres and lutes were used by the Middle Kingdom. Metal cymbals were used by ancient Egyptians. In the early 21st century, interest in the music of the pharaonic period began to grow, inspired by the research of such foreign-born musicologists as Hans Hickmann. By the early 21st century, Egyptian musicians and musicologists led by the musicology professor Khairy El-Malt at Helwan University in Cairo had begun to reconstruct musical instruments of Ancient Egypt, a project that is ongoing.Ancient Egyptian Music Symposium =Indus Valley= The Indus Valley civilization has sculptures that show old musical instruments, like the seven-holed flute. Various types of stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from Harappa and Mohenjo Daro by excavations carried out by Sir Mortimer Wheeler.World History: Societies of the Past By Charles Kahn (page 11) =References in the Bible= \\"David with his harp\\", from the Paris Psalter, c. 960, Constantinople. According to the Scriptures, Jubal was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). The harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of David, and it is referred to more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was \\"raised to its highest perfection under David\\" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that \\"It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).Lockyer, Herbert Jr. All the Music of the Bible, Hendrickson Publ. (2004) When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the lyre. A similar instrument was the lute, which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, the Bar Kochba Revolt coinage, were issued by the Jews during the Second Jewish Revolt against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD. In addition to those, there was the psaltery, another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to Josephus, it had twelve strings and was played with a quill, not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side. Miriam and women celebrate the crossing of the Red Sea with \\"timbrels\\" (small hand drums) (from the Tomić Psalter). Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet. There were also silver trumpets and the double oboe. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the Arch of Titus in Rome and from coins, that \\"the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound.\\" He adds that in War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls, these trumpets \\"appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison.\\" Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to Mosaic law and were probably among the trophies which the Emperor Titus brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, \\"there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. Young People's Story of Music, Dodd, Mead & Co. (1928) The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. \\"Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral.\\" The shofar (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the Jewish New Year services in orthodox communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of Sabbath, or to announce the death of a notable. \\"In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God,\\" writes Werner. Among the percussion instruments were bells, cymbals, sistrum, tabret, hand drums, and tambourines. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, \\"Miriam took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance.\\" =Ancient Greece= The hydraulis or \\"water organ\\". Note the curved trumpet, called the bukanē by the Greeks and, later, cornu by the Romans. In Ancient Greece, instruments in all music can be divided into three categories,Olson, pp. 108-109. based on how sound is produced: string, wind, and percussion. The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece: *the lyre: a strummed and occasionally plucked string instrument, essentially a hand-held zither built on a tortoise-shell frame, generally with seven or more strings tuned to the notes of one of the modes. The lyre was used to accompany others or even oneself for recitation and song. *the kithara, also a strummed string instrument, more complicated than the lyre. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the sounding box at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a plectrum. The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar. * the aulos, usually double, consisting of two double-reed (like an oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. Modern reconstructions indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate single-reeds instead of double reeds. * the Pan pipes, also known as panflute and syrinx (Greek συριγξ), (so- called for the nymph who was changed into a reed in order to hide from Pan) is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the stopped pipe, consisting of a series of such pipes of gradually increasing length, tuned (by cutting) to a desired scale. Sound is produced by blowing across the top of the open pipe (like blowing across a bottle top). * the hydraulis, a keyboard instrument, the forerunner of the modern organ. As the name indicates, the instrument used water to supply a constant flow of pressure to the pipes. Two detailed descriptions have survived: that of Vitruvius De Architectura x, 8. and Heron of Alexandria.Pneumatica, I, 42. These descriptions deal primarily with the keyboard mechanism and with the device by which the instrument was supplied with air. A well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885. Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air, and causing a steady supply of air to the pipes.Williams. In the Aeneid, Virgil makes numerous references to the trumpet. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis (water organ) and trumpet all found their way into the music of ancient Rome. =Roman Empire= Musicians in a detail from the Zliten mosaic (2nd century AD), originally shown as accompanying gladiator combat and wild-animal events in the arena: from left, the tuba, hydraulis (water pipe organ), and two cornua The Romans may have borrowed the Greek method of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four succeeding tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note. Roman art depicts various woodwinds, \\"brass\\", percussion and stringed instruments. Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces. Roman instruments include: *The Roman tuba was a long, straight bronze trumpet with a detachable, conical mouthpiece. Extant examples are about 1.3 metres long, and have a cylindrical bore from the mouthpiece to the point where the bell flares abruptly, similar to the modern straight trumpet seen in presentations of 'period music'. Since there were no valves, the tuba was capable only of a single overtone series. In the military, it was used for \\"bugle calls\\". The tuba is also depicted in art such as mosaics accompanying games (ludi) and spectacle events. *The cornu (Latin \\"horn\\") was a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, shaped rather like an uppercase G. It had a conical bore (again like a French horn) and a conical mouthpiece. It may be hard to distinguish from the buccina. The cornu was used for military signals and on parade. The cornicen was a military signal officer who translated orders into calls. Like the tuba, the cornu also appears as accompaniment for public events and spectacle entertainments. *The tibia (Greek aulos - αὐλός), usually double, had two double-reed (as in a modern oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band capistrum to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. *The askaules — a bagpipe. *Versions of the modern flute and panpipes. *The lyre, borrowed from the Greeks, was not a harp, but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body. *The cithara was the premier musical instrument of ancient Rome and was played both in popular and elevated forms of music. Larger and heavier than a lyre, the cithara was a loud, sweet and piercing instrument with precision tuning ability. *The lute (pandura or monochord) was known by several names among the Greeks and Romans. In construction, the lute differs from the lyre in having fewer strings stretched over a solid neck or fret- board, on which the strings can be stopped to produce graduated notes. Each lute string is thereby capable of producing a greater range of notes than a lyre string. Although long-necked lutes are depicted in art from Mesopotamia as early as 2340–2198 BC, and also occur in Egyptian iconography, the lute in the Greco-Roman world was far less common than the lyre and cithara. The lute of the medieval West is thought to owe more to the Arab oud, from which its name derives (al ʿūd). * The hydraulic pipe organ (hydraulis), which worked by water pressure, was \\"one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity\\". Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air and causing a steady supply to reach the pipes (also see Pipe organ#History). The hydraulis accompanied gladiator contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. *Variations of a hinged wooden or metal device, called a scabellum used to beat time. Also, there were various rattles, bells and tambourines. *Drum and percussion instruments like timpani and castanets, the Egyptian sistrum, and brazen pans, served various musical and other purposes in ancient Rome, including backgrounds for rhythmic dance, celebratory rites like those of the Bacchantes and military uses. *The sistrum was a rattle consisting of rings strung across the cross-bars of a metal frame, which was often used for ritual purposes. *Cymbala (Lat. plural of cymbalum, from the Greek kymbalon) were small cymbals: metal discs with concave centres and turned rims, used in pairs which were clashed together. =Islamic world= A number of musical instruments later used in medieval European music were influenced by Arabic musical instruments, including the rebec (an ancestor of the violin) from the rebab and the naker from naqareh. Many European instruments have roots in earlier Eastern instruments that were adopted from the Islamic world. The Arabic rabāb, also known as the spiked fiddle, is the earliest known bowed string instrument and the ancestor of all European bowed instruments, including the rebec, the Byzantine lyra, and the violin. The plucked and bowed versions of the rebab existed alongside each other. The bowed instruments became the rebec or rabel and the plucked instruments became the gittern. Curt Sachs linked this instrument with the mandola, the kopuz and the gambus, and named the bowed version rabâb. The Arabic oud in Islamic music was the direct ancestor of the European lute. The oud is also cited as a precursor to the modern guitar. The guitar has roots in the four-string oud, brought to Iberia by the Moors in the 8th century. A direct ancestor of the modern guitar is the ' (Moorish guitar), which was in use in Spain by 1200. By the 14th century, it was simply referred to as a guitar.Tom and Mary Anne Evans. Guitars: From the Renaissance to Rock. Paddington Press Ltd 1977 p.16 The origin of automatic musical instruments dates back to the 9th century, when the Persian Banū Mūsā brothers invented a hydropowered organ using exchangeable cylinders with pins, and also an automatic flute playing machine using steam power. These were the earliest automated mechanical musical instruments. The Banu Musa brothers' automatic flute player was the first programmable musical device, the first music sequencer, and the first example of repetitive music technology, powered by hydraulics. In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable humanoid automata band. According to Charles B. Fowler, the automata were a \\"robot band\\" which performed \\"more than fifty facial and body actions during each musical selection.\\" It was also the first programmable drum machine. Among the four automaton musicians, two were drummers. It was a drum machine where pegs (cams) bump into little levers that operated the percussion. The drummers could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.Noel Sharkey, A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive), University of Sheffield. =Middle Ages= Kýrie Eléison XI (Orbis Factor), which is from the Liber Usualis, which originated in the 11th century.Apel, Willi. Gregorian Chant. Indiana University Press, 1958. p. 417 Listen to it interpreted. During the medieval music era (476 to 1400) the plainchant tunes used for religious songs were primarily monophonic (a single line, unaccompanied melody). In the early centuries of the medieval era, these chants were taught and spread by oral tradition (\\"by ear\\"). The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system for writing down melodies. As Rome tried to standardize the various chants across vast distances of its empire, a form of music notation was needed to write down the melodies. Various signs written above the chant texts, called neumes were introduced. By the ninth century, it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The next development in musical notation was \\"heighted neumes\\", in which neumes were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the neumes to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval as well as the direction. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the neumes relating back to them. The line or lines acted as a reference point to help the singer gauge which notes were higher or lower. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to Guido d' Arezzo (c. 1000-1050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. The neumatic notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes or playing of melodies. The development of music notation made it faster and easier to teach melodies to new people, and facilitated the spread of music over long geographic distances. Musical notation from a Catholic Missal, c.1310-1320 Instruments used to perform medieval music include earlier, less mechanically sophisticated versions of a number of instruments that continue to be used in the 2010s. Medieval instruments include the flute, which was made of wood and could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument (it lacked the complex metal keys and airtight pads of 2010s-era metal flutes); the wooden recorder and the related instrument called the gemshorn; and the pan flute (a group of air columns attached together). Medieval music used many plucked string instruments like the lute, mandore, gittern and psaltery. The dulcimers, similar in structure to the psaltery and zither, were originally plucked, but became struck by hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new technology that made metal strings possible. Bowed strings were used as well. The bowed lyra of the Byzantine Empire was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. The Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the Byzantine lyra as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab rabāb and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the salandj (probably a bagpipe). The hurdy-gurdy was a mechanical violin using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to \\"bow\\" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the jaw harp were also popular in the time. Early versions of the organ, fiddle (or vielle), and trombone (called the sackbut) existed in the medieval era. =Renaissance= The Renaissance music era (c. 1400 to 1600) saw the development of many new technologies that affected the performance and distribution of songs and musical pieces. Around 1450, the printing press was invented, which made printed sheet music much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was laboriously hand-copied). The increased availability of printed sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger geographic area. Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously in the medieval era. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played included: *Slide trumpet: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary. *Cornett: Made of wood and was played like the recorder, but blown like a trumpet. *Trumpet: Early trumpets from the Renaissance era had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the overtone series. They were also made in different sizes. *Sackbut: A different name for the trombone, which replaced the slide trumpet by the middle of the 15th century Stringed instruments included: *Viol: This instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly has six strings. It was usually played with a bow. *Lyre: Its construction is similar to a small harp, although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum. Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow. *Hurdy-gurdy: (Also known as the wheel fiddle), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its \\"drone strings\\" which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes. *Gittern and mandore: these instruments were used throughout Europe. Forerunners of modern instruments including the mandolin and acoustic guitar. Percussion instruments included: *Tambourine: The tambourine is a frame drum equipped with jingles that produce a sound when the drum is struck. *Jew's harp: An instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with ones mouth. Woodwind instruments included: *Shawm: A typical shawm is keyless and is about a foot long with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were also most commonly made of wood and many of them had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular double reed instrument of the Renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose. Renaissance recorders *Reed pipe: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the predecessor of the saxophone and the clarinet. *Hornpipe: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end. *Bagpipe/Bladderpipe: It used a bag made out of sheep or goat skin that would provide air pressure for a pipe. When its player takes a breath, the player only needs to squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve. The reed is located inside the long metal mouthpiece, known as a bocal. *Panpipe: Designed to have sixteen wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it. *Transverse flute: The transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side. *Recorder: It uses a whistle mouth piece, which is a beak shaped mouth piece, as its main source of sound production. It is usually made with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. =Baroque= During the Baroque era of music (ca. 1600-1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and to the development of the first pianos. During the Baroque period, organ builders developed new types of pipes and reeds that created new tonal colors. Organ builders fashioned new stops that imitated various instruments, such as the viola da gamba. The Baroque period is often thought of as organ building's \\"golden age,\\" as virtually every important refinement to the instrument was brought to a peak. Builders such as Arp Schnitger, Jasper Johannsen, Zacharias Hildebrandt and Gottfried Silbermann constructed instruments that displayed both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well- balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large Pedal and Rückpositiv divisions. Harpsichord builders in the Southern Netherlands built instruments with two keyboards which could be used for transposition. These Flemish instruments served as the model for Baroque- era harpsichord construction in other nations. In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (e.g., the upper manual could be set to a quiet lute stop, while the lower manual could be set to a stop with multiple string choirs, for a louder sound). Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the Blanchet family and Pascal Taskin, are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments. In England, the Kirkman and Shudi firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority. German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding sixteen foot choirs, adding to the lower register and two foot choirs, which added to the upper register. The piano was invented during the Baroque era by the expert harpsichord maker Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany. Cristofori invented the piano at some point before 1700. While the clavichord allowed expressive control of volume, with harder or louder key presses creating louder sound (and vice versa) and fairly sustained notes, it was too quiet for large performances. The harpsichord produced a sufficiently loud sound, but offered little expressive control over each note. Pressing a harpsichord key harder or softer had no effect on the instrument's loudness. The piano offered the best of both, combining loudness with dynamic control. Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would damp the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat the same note rapidly. Cristofori's piano action was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed. Cristofori's early instruments were much louder and had more sustain than the clavichord. Even though the piano was invented in 1700, the harpsichord and pipe organ continued to be widely used in orchestra and chamber music concerts until the end of the 1700s. It took time for the new piano to gain in popularity. By 1800, though, the piano generally was used in place of the harpsichord (although pipe organ continued to be used in church music such as Masses). =Classicism= From about 1790 onward, the Mozart-era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing Industrial Revolution with resources such as high- quality steel piano wire for strings, and precision casting for the production of iron frames. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five octaves of Mozart's day to the 7-plus range found on modern pianos. Early technological progress owed much to the firm of Broadwood. John Broadwood joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, Americus Backers, to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the \\"grand\\". They achieved this in about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing ones that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed. They sent pianos to both Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a fifth (interval) during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The Viennese makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive. Beethoven's instrumentation for orchestra added piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No. 5. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver storm and sunshine in the Sixth. Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his Ninth Symphony expanded the sound of the orchestra. =Romanticism= During the Romantic music era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or in chamber music groups, such as string quartets. Saxophones began to appear in some 19th-century orchestra scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and Sergei Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances, the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's Boléro, Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2. The euphonium is featured in a few late Romantic and 20th-century works, usually playing parts marked \\"tenor tuba\\", including Gustav Holst's The Planets, and Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben. The Wagner tuba, a modified member of the horn family, appears in Richard Wagner's cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and several other works by Strauss, Béla Bartók, and others; it has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E Major. Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, Claude Debussy's La Mer, and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz. The piano continued to undergo technological developments in the Romantic era, up until the 1860s. By the 1820s, the center of piano building innovation had shifted to Paris, where the Pleyel firm manufactured pianos used by Frédéric Chopin and the Érard firm manufactured those used by Franz Liszt. In 1821, Sébastien Érard invented the double escapement action, which incorporated a repetition lever (also called the balancier) that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by Henri Herz, the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced. Other improvements of the mechanism included the use of felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by Jean-Henri Pape in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The sostenuto pedal, invented in 1844 by Jean-Louis Boisselot and copied by the Steinway firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects. One innovation that helped create the sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the \\"plate\\", the iron frame sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension that can exceed 20 tons in a modern grand. The single piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in Boston by Alpheus Babcock,Isacoff (2012, 74) combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings. In 1834, the Webster & Horsfal firm of Birmingham brought out a form of piano wire made from cast steel; according to Dolge it was \\"so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly.\\"Dolge (1911, 124) Other important advances included changes to the way the piano is strung, such as the use of a \\"choir\\" of three strings rather than two for all but the lowest notes, and the implementation of an over-strung scale, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own bridge height. The mechanical action structure of the upright piano was invented in London, England in 1826 by Robert Wornum, and upright models became the most popular model, also amplifying the sound. =20th- and 21st-century music= With 20th-century music, there was a vast increase in music listening, as the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used to replay and distribute music. The invention of sound recording and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the acousmaticSchaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris. and Musique concrète schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the multitrack recording system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. The 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, op. cit. In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand- picked by the composer. Saxophones were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. In the 2000s, the modern orchestra became standardized with the modern instrumentation that includes a string section, woodwinds, brass instruments, percussion, piano, celeste, and even, for some 20th century or 21st century works, electric instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass and/or electronic instruments such as the Theremin or synthesizer. Electric and electro-mechanical Electric music technology refers to musical instruments and recording devices that use electrical circuits, which are often combined with mechanical technologies. Examples of electric musical instruments include the electro-mechanical electric piano (invented in 1929), the electric guitar (invented in 1931), the electro-mechanical Hammond organ (developed in 1934) and the electric bass (invented in 1935). None of these electric instruments produce a sound that is audible by the performer or audience in a performance setting unless they are connected to instrument amplifiers and loudspeaker cabinets, which made them sound loud enough for performers and the audience to hear. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are separate from the instrument in the case of the electric guitar (which uses a guitar amplifier), electric bass (which uses a bass amplifier) and some electric organs (which use a Leslie speaker or similar cabinet) and electric pianos. Some electric organs and electric pianos include the amplifier and speaker cabinet within the main housing for the instrument. =Electric piano= Rhodes Mark II Stage 73 electric piano. An electric piano is an electric musical instrument which produces sounds when a performer presses the keys of the piano-style musical keyboard. Pressing keys causes mechanical hammers to strike metal strings or tines, leading to vibrations which are converted into electrical signals by magnetic pickups, which are then connected to an instrument amplifier and loudspeaker to make a sound loud enough for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a synthesizer, the electric piano is not an electronic instrument. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel, metal tines or short wires to produce the tone. The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s. =Electric guitar= Kramer XKG-20 electric guitar circa 1980. An electric guitar is a guitar that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical impulses. The most common guitar pickup uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is amplified before being sent to a loudspeaker. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using electronic effects such as reverb and distortion. Invented in 1931, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz guitarists sought to amplify their sound in the big band format. =Hammond organ= A Hammond C-3 electric organ. The Hammond organ is an electric organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured, and it has been described as one of the most successful organs. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker. The organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe organ, or instead of a piano. It quickly became popular with professional jazz bandleaders, who found that the room-filling sound of a Hammond organ could form small bands such as organ trios which were less costly than paying an entire big band. =Electric bass= The electric bass (or bass guitar) was invented in the 1930s, but it did not become commercially successful or widely used until the 1950s. It is a stringed instrument played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, slapping, popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four to six strings or courses. The electric bass usually uses metal strings and an electromagnetic pickup which senses the vibrations in the strings. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an amplifier and speaker for live performances. Electronic or digital Electronic or digital music technology is any device, such as a computer, an electronic effects unit or software, that is used by a musician or composer to help make or perform music. The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, computer hardware and computer software that is used in the performance, playback, recording, composition, sound recording and reproduction, mixing, analysis and editing of music. Electronic or digital music technology is connected to both artistic and technological creativity. Musicians and music technology experts are constantly striving to devise new forms of expression through music, and they are physically creating new devices and software to enable them to do so. Although in the 2010s, the term is most commonly used in reference to modern electronic devices and computer software such as digital audio workstations and Pro Tools digital sound recording software, electronic and digital musical technologies have precursors in the electric music technologies of the early 20th century, such as the electromechanical Hammond organ, which was invented in 1929. In the 2010s, the ontological range of music technology has greatly increased, and it may now be electronic, digital, software-based or indeed even purely conceptual. An early Minimoog synthesizer by R.A. Moog Inc. from 1970. A synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate existing sounds (instruments, vocal, natural sounds, etc.), or generate new electronic timbres or sounds that did not exist before. They are often played with an electronic musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled using a controller device.

In most species, the female only engages in copulation when she is fertile. However, extended sexuality has been documented in old world primates, pair bonded birds and some insects (such as carrion beetles). Extended sexuality is most prominent in human females who exhibit no change in copulation rate across the ovarian cycle. Although this behaviour incurs costs to females, such as energy and time, many researchers have proposed reasons for its existence. These hypotheses include the male assistance hypothesis, which proposes that females gain non-genetic benefits (such as food and shelter) in exchange for sexual access. A sub-hypothesis of this is Hrdy's, proposing extended female sexuality as an adaptive process aiming to creating paternity confusion in males. Alternative hypotheses, classified as 'male- driven', claim that extended female sexuality occurs due to male adaptations, resulting from an inability to detect fertility status in females or to dampen immune responses against sperm. Finally, Spuhler's hypothesis suggests that the behaviour may have arisen as an incidental effect of larger adrenal glands in humans. The human menstrual cycle Occurrence=In non-humans= Although not found in all organisms, researchers have identified sexual intercourse patterns in certain animals that reflect extended female sexuality, such as in some old world primates, birds and insects. Extensive research has focused on analysing the musk shrew's rate of sexual behaviour. The only period that is associated with a drop in female receptivity to copulation is during mid to late pregnancy; yet, even at this time, occasional mating is reported. Therefore, researchers have concluded that this animal has similar sexual receptivity across infertile and fertile phases. Within primates, research has consistently found evidence of extended female sexuality in the rhesus monkey and chimpanzees. Both of these primates mate at all stages of the ovarian cycle, with only slight increases in sexual receptivity during fertile stages, and decreases during menstruation. =In humans= Human females are considered to exhibit the greatest degree of extended female sexuality, with receptivity to sexual intercourse remaining constant across fertile and infertile phases of the reproductive cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, and in adolescence. In a study of 20,000 women from 13 countries, frequency of copulation was reportedly the same across all stages of the ovarian cycle. The only notable drop in sexual behaviour occurred during menstruation. Therefore, women largely showed the same level of sexual behaviour in the non-fertile phases of their ovarian cycles as in the fertile phases. Researchers have investigated the effect of hormonal contraceptive use in women on the frequency of sexual intercourse. Many of these contraceptives mimic a pregnancy state in females by altering hormone levels. Therefore, women who use these contraceptives do not experience the fertile phases of their cycles. In a systematic review, it appeared that the frequency of sexual intercourse was unaffected by contraceptive use in the majority of women. Although artificially created, this adds to the literature documenting the existence of copulation in humans during non-fertile periods. = Impact of concealed ovulation = In order to encourage mating in non-conceptive periods and to encourage males to maintain their proximity, males must possess imperfect knowledge of the female's fertility status. This is achieved through concealed ovulation in most animals that exhibit extended female sexuality. A review of studies revealed that, in humans, females only exhibit subtle changes during estrus, making it difficult for males to assess fertility with precision. In the !Kung tribe, for instance, females lack any overt signals of fertility and are continuously receptive to sexual intercourse, encouraging males to remain and provide resources. The Trobriand people with Bronisław Malinowski Explanations= Male assistance hypothesis = Mating outside the fertile window of their ovarian cycle may incur considerable costs for females, such as in time and energy usage. To counteract these costs, the male assistance hypothesis argues that females exhibit extended sexuality to obtain resources from males. These resources vary between species, but can include food, social alliance, and protection of the female and her offspring. For example, in the Trobriand tribe, men give women gifts in exchange for sexual access. From this hypothesis, three predictions can be made. Male provision of non-genetic resources Firstly, in species that demonstrate extended female sexuality, there should be evidence that the males provide non-genetic resources to females. This prediction is supported in a variety of animals, with reviews revealing that male assistance (such as food or protection), is provided to certain mammals and communally breeding birds in exchange for mating outside the conceptive period. For example, female blackbirds that solicit mating outside the fertile period have increased mate guarding from their pair-bonded partner. This increases protection against other sexually coercive males and ensures the provision of other material benefits. In a review investigating primates that exhibit extended female sexuality, it was noted that females engaging in extended sexuality benefited from increased offspring protection and paternal care from males. Enhanced reproductive success Secondly, in order to outweigh the aforementioned costs, mating during infertile phases should increase females' reproductive success by increasing the number of offspring produced. Current research has only investigated this factor indirectly, and it has predominantly been investigated in insects. For example, when male insects deliver material benefits in exchange for sexual access, the reproductive success of the females increases with the number of matings. It is important to note that the mating behaviour assessed was not limited to extended female sexuality. Hence, it only provides indirect support for the second prediction. Shifting mate preferences and behaviour across the ovarian cycle The final prediction of the male-assistance hypothesis has been extensively investigated. It predicts that females will exhibit differing mate preferences during fertile and non-fertile periods. Specifically, when fertile, the females will be sensitive to indicators of high genetic quality to increase the genetic quality of her offspring. Conversely, outside of the fertile period, females will show a preference for males who can provide resources for her and her offspring. In most species, males of higher genetic quality offer fewer non-genetic resources (such as shelter and food) than those of lower quality, so females are likely to choose different males at each stage. Evidence for this prediction has been found in many different species. In hens, those near peak fertility show a preference for socially dominant roosters with large combs. Larger combs have been reliably associated with health and offspring survival so reliably indicate the genetic quality of the rooster. In the non-fertile phases, hens mate more indiscriminately with less regard for the larger comb size. A similar pattern emerges in humans. A review of relevant studies on female preferences across the ovarian cycle reveals that women show a greater preference for masculine traits in fertile phases, especially for short term mating intention. This finding occurs across a variety of traits, such as masculine voices, body and facial features, scent, and behavioural displays. The level of masculinity acts as an indicator of genetic quality through its association with high testosterone. Similarly, women show a preference for higher levels of symmetry, which is thought to indicate underlying developmental stability. However, during infertile phases, women prefer males with lower masculinity and symmetry, as they tend to be more willing to offer material benefits. comb In addition to impacting mating preferences, females have been found to exhibit differing mating behaviour at different cycle stages. An analysis of 121 studies with female birds showed that most mate outside their pair bond at a higher rate when fertile, especially when the primary partner possesses indicators of low quality genes. During infertile phases, birds showed reductions in this behaviour, suggesting that the function of extended female sexuality is not to increase the genetic quality of offspring. In humans, females show increased motivation for mating with other males at mid-cycle without an accompanying increase in copulation with their long term partner, especially if the partner was less physically attractive. =Hrdy's hypothesis= An infant lutung (Old World monkey) Hrdy's hypothesis is an extension of the male assistance hypothesis, in that both hypotheses argue that women have evolved this adaptation to gain some tangible benefit from males. According to Hrdy's hypothesis, extended female sexuality is an adaptive process with an aim of creating paternity confusion in their male counterparts. Paternity confusion refers to the male being unsure as to whether offspring are genetically his own. If the female mates with different males (at all points of her ovarian cycle) whilst concealing fertility, then the males will inevitably have paternity confusion. Paternity confusion is proposed to be an adaptive function for preventing infanticide. Thus, if the female can successfully create paternity confusion, males will be less likely to kill her offspring, as the lack of paternity certainty means that they run the risk of killing their own genetic offspring. Additionally, the males, in turn, are likely to protect the same female's offspring from infanticide that may be committed by other adults within the species. Once again, this is because they are uncertain about paternity, and aim to protect infants that are genetically their own. Paternity confusion in primates Researchers have analysed the behaviour of chimpanzees, with particular reference to copulation calling. Copulation calling is a type of vocalisation used to attract mates. The calls are vocalised either before, during, or after sexual intercourse. Copulation calling, in line with Hrdy's hypothesis, may then be one way to ensure that the female can mate with as many different males as possible, causing paternity confusion. Indeed, the authors found that the probability of copulatory calling in female chimpanzees was not modulated by the ovarian phase of the female caller, thereby aiding paternity confusion. This paternity confusion ultimately ensures that the woman has access to the resources of a number of different males. These resources can be utilised by her, as well as by her offspring. Criticism of Hrdy's hypothesis emerges from evidence which suggests that male primates can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others. In one study, researchers analysed the DNA of 75 juvenile baboons to conclude who fathered them. They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or a threat to their social standing. Evidently, if males can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others, then there is no purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will know whether the offspring is, or is not, their own. Future research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions. Concealed estrus as a function of paternity confusion in primates Research is fairly consistent in the finding that species with concealed estrus mate at all stages of their ovarian cycle. For instance, mating activity in assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) has been investigated. The researchers analysed the levels of progesterone in the monkeys, in order to establish the ovarian stage of the female, as progesterone peaks following the fertile window. They found that the females concealed estrus and were sexually receptive during the entire mating season. Concealed estrus and sexual receptivity (at all times of the ovarian cycle) aids paternity confusion. This is because the males are unsure of who mated with the female during her fertile period, and so do not know the identity of the father. Hrdy's hypothesis has been criticised, however, on the basis that some female primates show both extended female sexuality and sexual swellings. In terms of Hrdy's hypothesis these two concepts are incompatible. Sexual swellings appear only during the most fertile phase of the female's ovarian cycle, with the purpose of advertising fertility. In sharp contrast, according to Hrdy, extended sexuality is adapted to conceal fertility and ensure mating across all stages of the ovarian cycle, to aid paternity confusion. =Male- driven hypotheses= One of the alternative explanations is that extended female sexuality is 'male-driven'. This hypothesis is theoretically based on male uncertainty regarding the fertility status of females. Although some physiological changes occur during the fertile period that may act as reliable indicators (e.g. the concentration of oestrogen can change female scent), most species have not evolved signals advertising fertility (e.g. sexual swellings). Therefore, males will be unable to detect fertility with any precision. As a result, extended female sexuality is proposed as a male sexually selected trait. Males will pursue sexual access throughout the entirety of the ovarian cycle to increase their chances of impregnating the female. According to this hypothesis, females lack any benefit from this activity due to their inability to conceive, yet will be coerced by males to engage in sexual intercourse. The training hypothesis Human sperm under a microscope Another hypothesis claiming that extended female sexuality has evolved to benefit males' interests is the 'training hypothesis'. It has been shown that women's immune systems attack foreign antigens found in sperm. This may reduce the likelihood of conception so reduce the reproductive success for the males. However, prior exposure to sperm antigens can dampen the immune response to increase the chances of successful conception and implantation. Therefore, males may have evolved to train and 'condition' women's immune systems by copulating with females during infertile periods, in order to reduce the likelihood of her immune system reacting against the sperm's antigens from lack of exposure. Indeed, research has identified findings consistent with this hypothesis. Couples who had used condoms before trying to conceive were more likely to suffer complications, such as pre- eclampsia, during pregnancy as a result of the woman's immune system having no prior exposure to the antigens in the sperm. In non-humans, an increased frequency of copulation in crickets has been shown to reduce the female's immune response to sperm. This hypothesis has received much criticism. For example, as all mammals experience the same immune system responses to sperm antigens, this hypothesis predicts that all mammals should exhibit extended female sexuality. However, only few species of mammals exhibit sexual behaviour outside the conceptive period. =Spuhler's hypothesis= Spuhler's hypothesis is a stand-alone hypothesis of extended female sexuality. Spuhler suggests that extended female sexuality has evolved as a by-product of an adaptation in females that increases the levels of adrenal hormones. He proposed that secretion of higher levels of adrenal hormones were initially selected in women in order to increase endurance for walking or running. This hypothesis suggests that the larger adrenal glands may have contributed to the development of extended female sexuality as they are also the main source of 'libido hormones', which increase the female's sexual drive. Thus, extended sexuality is little to do with sexual behavior, or evolutionary advantage, but rather it is just a by-product of hormones.Williams, G. C. (1966). Adaptation and Natural SelectionPrinceton University Press. Princeton, NJ. However, this hypothesis cannot account for extended female sexuality in invertebrates, which lack adrenal systems. Additionally Spuhler highlighted the existence of larger thyroid and adrenal glands in humans compared to other primates. However, no empirical evidence has established the link between hormones and endurance walking as an adaptation and extended female sexuality as a natural incidental effect. As there are costs to extended sexuality, it can be argued that selection would serve the dissociation of extended sexuality from the mechanism that affects endurance walking.

When the contract was acquired by Aramark in 2015, it was required to purchase the assets of the previous concessionaire—just as Delaware North was required to before. However, Delaware North claimed that the sale did not include its intellectual property, which included trademarks for various place names in the park, and valued them at $51 million. Delaware North sued the United States in the Court of Federal Claims in 2015. The NPS disputed the cost of these intangible assets, as well as Delaware North having registered the marks in the first place. Upon Aramark's transition to concessionaire in March 2016, the trademarked place names were replaced by alternative names. In July 2019, Delaware North reached a roughly $12 million settlement, under which the original place names would be restored, and Delaware North agreed to return the trademarks to the NPS upon the conclusion of Aramark's contract. Background In 2014, the United States National Park Service opened bids on a new concessions contract for Yosemite National Park's properties. When Delaware North assumed the role of concessionary in 1993, it was contractually required to purchase the assets of the previous concessionaire — Yosemite Park & Curry Company — at fair market value, including furniture, equipment, vehicles, and \\"other property\\". Its ultimate successor, Aramark subsidiary Yosemite Hospitality, LLC (who was awarded a 15-year contract), would be subject to similar terms. Intellectual property was not explicitly listed in the contract; this includes trademarks that were registered by Delaware North, including place names such as \\"Yosemite National Park\\", Ahwahnee, Badger Pass, Curry Village, Yosemite Lodge, and the slogan \\"Go climb a rock\\". In 2015, Delaware North sued the NPS in the United States Court of Claims for breach of contract, claiming that the NPS did not cause the intellectual property to be sold to Aramark, and demanded a payment from Aramark for the property, to be determined in court. Delaware North initially asserted the fair market value of its intangible properties to be $51 million. The National Park Service estimated the value of the intangible assets at $3.5 million, and also suggested that the marks should not have been filed for by Delaware North to begin with. At the request of Delaware North, the National Park Service had amended the bid notice to explicitly mention intellectual property, again without specifying trademarks.. The park service contended that the intellectual property includes assets such as websites and customer databases, but not the trademarks. Delaware North claimed to have offered to temporarily license the trademarks while the dispute is resolved, but that the government did not respond. The Park Service said that accepting the offer could be seen as acknowledging the legitimacy of the trademarks. Name changes In January 2016, it was announced that due to the legal dispute, properties at Yosemite National Park would be renamed effective March 1, 2016, when Aramark's contract officially began. The Ahwahnee was renamed the Majestic Yosemite Hotel, Camp Curry was renamed, \\"Half Dome Village\\", the Yosemite Lodge became Yosemite Valley Lodge, the Wawona Hotel became Big Tree Lodge, and the Badger Pass Ski Area became the Yosemite Ski & Snowboard Area. Resolution On July 15, 2019, Delaware North and the Park Service announced that they had settled the lawsuit, and that the original names would be reinstated; the government paid $3.84 million to Delaware North, and Aramark paid $8.16 million. Delaware North agreed to turn over tangible assets that had not yet been transferred to Aramark, and return the Yosemite-related trademarks to the Park Service at no cost following the conclusion of Aramark's concessions contract.

A Wurlitzer model 112 electric piano plugged into an instrument amplifier. Electric music technology refers to musical instruments and recording devices that use electrical circuits, which are often combined with mechanical technologies. Examples of electric musical instruments include the electro-mechanical electric piano (invented in 1929), the electric guitar (invented in 1931), the electro-mechanical Hammond organ (developed in 1934) and the electric bass (invented in 1935). All of these electric instruments do not produce a sound that is audible by the performer or audience in a performance setting unless they are connected to instrument amplifiers and loudspeaker cabinets, which made them sound loud enough for performers and the audience to hear. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are separate from the instrument in the case of the electric guitar (which uses a guitar amplifier), electric bass (which uses a bass amplifier) and some electric organs (which use a Leslie speaker or similar cabinet) and most electric pianos. Some electric organs and electric pianos include the amplifier and speaker cabinet within the main housing for the instrument. Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small microphone diaphragm that can record sound waves on a phonograph (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record) or magnetic tape. The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical phonograph cylinder, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877 and patented in 1878.Publication Images The next major technical development was the invention of the gramophone disc in 1889. For much of the 20th century, records were the most common way of selling sound recordings. The widespread availability of records and the development of radio broadcasting enabled a much larger proportion of people to listen to songs and pieces performed by the top artists, enabling the development of national and even international musical stars. In the 1970s, the compact cassette became a major consumer audio format. Advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the Sony Walkman, a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979, which allowed consumers to listen to their favourite albums outside of their home. Electric instruments=Electric piano= Rhodes Mark II Stage 73 electric piano. It has to be plugged into an instrument amplifier or guitar amp to be heard by the performer and audience. An electric piano is an electric musical instrument which produces sounds when a performer presses the keys of the piano-style musical keyboard. Pressing keys causes mechanical hammers to strike metal strings or tines, leading to vibrations which are converted into electrical signals by magnetic pickups, which are then connected to an instrument amplifier and loudspeaker to make a sound loud enough for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a synthesizer, the electric piano is not an electronic instrument. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel, metal tines or short wires to produce the tone. The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s; the 1929 Neo-Bechstein electric grand piano was among the first. Probably the earliest stringless model was Lloyd Loar's Vivi- Tone Clavier. A few other noteworthy producers of electric pianos include Baldwin Piano and Organ Company and the Wurlitzer company. Early electric piano recordings include Duke Ellington's in 1955 and Sun Ra's India as well as other tracks from the 1956 sessions included on his second album Super Sonic Jazz (aka Super Sonic Sounds). The popularity of the electric piano began to grow in the late 1950s after Ray Charles's 1959 hit record \\"What'd I Say\\", reaching its height during the 1970s, after which they were progressively displaced by more lightweight electronic pianos capable of piano-like sounds without the disadvantages of electric pianos' heavy weight and moving mechanical parts. Another factor driving their development and acceptance was the progressive electrification of popular music and the need for a portable keyboard instrument capable of high-volume amplification. Musicians adopted a number of types of domestic electric pianos for rock and pop use. This encouraged their manufacturers to modify them for stage use and then develop models primarily intended for stage use. Digital electronic stage pianos have largely replaced most of the original electro-mechanical instruments in the 2000s, due to the small size, low weight and versatility of digital instruments, which can produce a huge range of tones besides piano tones (e.g., emulations of Hammond organ sounds, synthesizer sounds, etc.). However, some performers still perform and record with vintage electric pianos. In 2009, Fender Rhodes produced a new line of electro-mechanical pianos, known as the Rhodes Mark 7 followed by an offering from Vintage Vibe. =Electric guitar= Kramer XKG-20 electric guitar circa 1980. An electric guitar is a guitar that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical impulses. The most common guitar pickup uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is amplified before being sent to a loudspeaker. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using electronic effects such as reverb and distortion. Invented in 1931, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz guitarists sought to amplify their sound in the big band format. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record included Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in pop music. It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles. It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, and many other genres of music. Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge that lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a vibrato. The sound of a guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, hammering on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing. There are several types of electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar, various types of hollow-body guitars, the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E, and the twelve-string electric guitar, which has six pairs of strings. Popular music and rock groups often use the electric guitar in two roles: as a rhythm guitar, which provides the chord sequence or progression and sets the beat (as part of a rhythm section), and as a lead guitar, which is used to perform melody lines, melodic instrumental fill passages, and solos. =Hammond organ= A Hammond C-3 electric organ. The Hammond organ is an electric organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured, and it has been described as one of the most successful organs. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker. The organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe organ, or instead of a piano. It quickly became popular with professional jazz musicians, who found it a cheaper alternative to the big band. Jimmy Smith's use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in rhythm and blues, rock and reggae, as well as being an important instrument in progressive rock. The Hammond Organ Company struggled financially during the 1970s as they abandoned tonewheel organs and switched to manufacturing instruments using integrated circuits. These instruments were not as popular with musicians as the tonewheels had been, and the company went out of business in 1985. The Hammond name was purchased by the Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation, which proceeded to manufacture digital simulations of the most popular tonewheel organs. This culminated in the production of the \\"New B-3\\" in 2002, which provided an accurate recreation of the original B-3 organ using modern digital technology. Hammond-Suzuki continues to manufacture a variety of organs for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as Korg, Roland and Clavia, have also achieved success in providing emulations of the original tonewheel organs. The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as Native Instruments B4. =Electric bass= Two electric basses and a bass amplifier. This amplification setup is a \\"bass stack\\" approach, in which an amplifier (in this case a Hartke 5000) is plugged into separate speaker cabinets. The electric bass (or bass guitar) is a stringed instrument played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, slapping, popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four to six strings or courses. The four- string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the double bass,Bass guitar/Double Bass tuning E1=41.20 Hz, A1=55 Hz, D2=73.42 Hz, G2=98 Hz + optional low B0=30.87 Hz which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G).Standard guitar tuning E2=82.41 Hz, A2=110 Hz, D3=146.8 Hz, G3=196 Hz, B3=246.9 Hz, E4=329.6 Hz The bass guitar is a transposing instrument, as it is notated in bass clef an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive ledger lines. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an amplifier and speaker for live performances. Since the 1960s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music as the bass instrument in the rhythm section.Roberts, Jim (2001). 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' p. 56 \\"The surf/instrumental rock genres of the early 1960s were crucial proving grounds of the still-newfangled electric bass ...\\" While types of bass lines vary widely from one style of music to another, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework and establishing the beat. Many styles of music utilise the bass guitar, including rock, metal, pop, punk rock, country, reggae, gospel, blues, and jazz. It is often a solo instrument in jazz, jazz fusion, Latin, funk, progressive rock and other rock and metal styles. Electric sound recording and reproduction Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small microphone diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure (acoustic sound waves) and record them as a graphic representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a phonograph (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record). In magnetic tape recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying electric current, which is then converted to a varying magnetic field by an electromagnet, which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger loudspeaker diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves. Electrically generated signals may also be recorded directly from devices such as an electric guitar pickup, without the use of acoustic sounds or amplifiers in the recording process (other than the need for musicians to hear herself playing during recording session). =Phonautograph= The first device that could record actual sounds as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the phonautograph, patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called \\"phonautograms\\", made in 1857. They consist of sheets of paper with sound- wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it. =Phonograph=Phonograph cylinder The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical phonograph cylinder, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877 and patented in 1878.Publication Images The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s. The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910. Disc phonograph [more details] Emile Berliner with disc record gramophone The next major technical development was the invention of the gramophone disc, generally credited to Emile Berliner and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the gramophone record overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s. The long-playing 33 rpm microgroove vinyl record, or \\"LP\\", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl single was introduced by RCA Victor in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the \\"78\\" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact \\"45\\" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as \\"unbreakable\\". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as \\"unbreakable\\" compared to wax cylinders. =Electrical recording= RCA-44, a classic ribbon microphone introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today. Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the advent of digital media, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called electrical recording, in which a microphone was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the \\"horn sound\\" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured. Sound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the Telegraphone,The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a Telegraphone magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is that of a contemporary telephone. it remained so until the 1920s, when several recent radio-related developments in electronics converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic amplification to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, Lee De Forest invented the Audion triode vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first transistor-based audio devices in the 1950s. =Magnetic tape= Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right) An important field of invention during this period was the tape recorder. Magnetic tape recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a tape head, which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature electric generator as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it. Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it. Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the Ampex 200 model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor Les Paul had invented the first multitrack tape recorder, ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the Musique Concrète school and avant garde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as Frank Zappa, The Beatles and The Beach Boys. The ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and tape echo allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop broadcast cartridge led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising. =Stereo and hi-fi= Magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity stereophonic sound. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by Bell Laboratories, who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two- channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by Judy Garland for the MGM movie Listen, Darling in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's Fantasia, released in 1940. The 1941 release of Fantasia used the \\"Fantasound\\" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a \\"control\\" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States. Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35 mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the \\"Cinemascope\\" four-track magnetic sound system. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first Stereosonic tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels. 161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the US. Two-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s. They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases. Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive. A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels: $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively. Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many Sixties pop albums now available only in stereo were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \\"stereo\\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape. Magnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is Les Paul's 1951 recording of How High the Moon, on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, Frank Zappa, and The Beatles (with producer George Martin) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of multitrack recording techniques and effects on their landmark albums Pet Sounds, Freak Out!, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the Sony Walkman, a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for reel-to-reel tape decks, which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.

Early life  Heineman was born to a Jewish family in Washington, D.C., the son of Cristine Russell and Ben Heineman,http://ncadvertiser.com/20838/former-new-canaanites-film-airs-on-cnn/ and grew up in Darien and New Canaan, Connecticut. He attended New Canaan Country School and Brunswick School in Greenwich. His mother is a science journalist and his father is a lawyer. His career as a filmmaker began after graduating from Dartmouth College in 2005. He studied history in college and initially wanted to be a teacher. Heineman was fascinated with American history, notably the American Civil War. He told C-SPAN in 2012, “I think it really taught me to be analytical, to think critically about events” and “try to learn from the past to affect the future.” Career He and his friends took a post-graduation trip across the U.S., and Heineman shot video along the way. He and his friends spent three months living out of an RV, interviewing kids “from all walks of life, trying to figure out what our generation is about.” The resulting footage (which Heineman dubbed, “rough, guerilla filmmaking”) became Our Time (2011), a feature-length documentary about American youth. He began shopping around Our Time, which was self-produced via Our Time Projects, Inc., a production company Heineman founded in 2009. Heineman was hired at HBO and spent two years working on HBO’s The Alzheimer’s Project, a four-part documentary series. He was mentored by director Susan Froemke and producer John Hoffman. Heineman worked with Froemke to direct and co-produce Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare (2012). The film was later picked up and aired by CNN. The film received a New York Times Critics Pick. “This hard-hitting film leaves us finally more hopeful than despairing,” wrote reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis.  First films  Heineman studied history at Dartmouth College and planned to start a career as a teacher after graduating in 2005. After he was rejected by Teach for America, however, he said he felt a blow to his ego, and decided to take a road trip with friends across the U.S. Although he had never held a camera or taken a film class, Heineman used a video camera to document the group’s experiences and interviewed youth along the way. “It was really cheap. I mean, we were scraping together money from family and friends. We got sponsorship money from Nantucket Nectars and Penske Corporation, and — but it was really, you know, bootstraps, you know, rough guerilla filmmaking.” Heineman said he walked away from that trip feeling inspired about his own opportunities and a career change. “No matter where you're from, no matter what your background is, is that, you know, everyone has this burning desire to be better, to do better, to improve their surroundings, to improve themselves,” Heineman said in an interview with C-SPAN in 2012. “Our generation, you know, does want to fix this country, does want to fix this world, and I don't know if it's going to happen overnight, I think our world is changing every day.” Heineman approached HBO with his film and while he was turned down, he was hired to work on a health care film series called The Alzheimer’s Project. Heineman continued working on edits of Our Time after he was hired by HBO. The film was released in 2009. Heineman then teamed up with mentor Froemke to begin work on Escape Fire. = Escape Fire = Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare is a 2012 feature-length documentary directed by Matthew Heineman and Susan Froemkeand released by Roadside Attractions. Escape Fire premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, opened in select theaters on October 5, 2012, and was simultaneously released on iTunes and Video-on-Demand. The film was released on DVD in February 2013 and premiered on CNN on March 10, 2013. The film tells the stories of physicians and patients, alike, taking creative steps at improving the U.S. health care industry. It gets its name from the practice of protecting firefighters battling wildfires by pre-burning a small patch of area so that the oncoming blaze will move around it. “What Americans desperately need is a way to transition from the current system, which is fragmented and focuses on high-cost, high-tech interventions after illness strikes, to a modern system that delivers coordinated, high-touch, lower-cost, patient-centered care with an emphasis on primary care and prevention,” Heineman wrote in an opinion piece at The Huffington Post in 2012. While making Escape Fire, Heineman said his goal was to be politically agnostic and offer solutions, not just problems. “So many of these documentaries - you know, you sort of walk out of them feeling depressed and hopeless. And we really did not want to make that type of film. From day one, we wanted to make a film that highlighted not just problems, but solutions.” Escape Fire was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance (2012), and received several other accolades, including: Full Frame Human Rights Award (2012); Silverdocs Social Issue Award (2012); Newport Beach Outstanding Achievement in Directing and Outstanding Achievement in Documentary Filmmaking (2012). = Cartel Land = Cartel Land is a 2015 documentary about the Mexican drug trade and vigilantism that has sprouted up to combat it. It shows the story of Dr. Jose Manuel Mireles, a doctor in the Mexican state of Michoacán. Mireles leads a group of citizens who take up arms against drug traffickers, sometimes resulting in gun battles on the streets and clashes with federal police. Cartel Land premiered at Sundance in 2015, where it won Best Director U.S. Documentary and Documentary Special Jury Award: Cinematography (U.S. Documentary). The film later had screenings at the 2015 True/False Film Fest in Columbia, Mo., and had its New York debut at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival. The film was released theatrically nationwide by The Orchard in July 2015 and had its broadcast premiere on A&E; in January 2016. It has been nominated for numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, a BAFTA Award for Best Documentary, and won three Primetime Emmy Awards, including Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking. In addition, Cartel Land was nominated for a Gotham Award, Critics’ Choice Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Documentary, and presented with the 2015 Documentary Award by the George Polk Awards in Investigative Journalism. “I wanted to tackle huge, complicated subjects — vigilantism, border security, the drug war — but in a far more personal and targeted way, through the eyes of the compelling and deeply complex individuals at the heart of these vigilante movements,” Heineman said before the film’s premiere at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Heineman conceived the film after reading a news article on the New York City Subway about vigilantes tracking drug cartels along the U.S.-Mexican border in Mexico. “I didn’t know much about border, much about vigilantism. But from the moment I read it, I knew I wanted to make this film.” The film’s story then shifted to parallel storylines about two groups of vigilantes fighting against the drug trade on both sides of the border. Heineman was also one of two cinematographers credited in the film. “I never knew who I was with — the good guys or the bad guys,” Heineman told interviewers at Sundance Film Festival. The film received positive reviews in trade publications such as Variety. “The pic’s lush, aestheticized imagery is an impressive surprise, and the film has no shortage of ace handheld work,” wrote reviewer Ben Kenigsberg. IndieWire called it: “Disturbing, dangerous, and thrilling, Cartel Land is a fearsome reflection on the breakdown of order and the line between obeying the law and staying alive.” = City of Ghosts = City of Ghosts is a 2017 feature documentary directed, produced, and filmed by Heineman. It follows the journey of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently – a handful of anonymous activists who banded together after their homeland of Syria was taken over by ISIS in 2014. City of Ghosts is the story of a group of Syrian citizen journalists as they face life undercover, on the run, and in exile. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2017 and was acquired by Amazon Studios. It was released theatrically by Amazon and IFC Films on July 14, 2017. The film has received many positive reviews, including five stars from Charlie Philips at The Guardian, who called it the \\"definitive contemporary documentary about the tragedy of Syria.\\" As of March 8, 2018, City of Ghosts holds a 99% 'fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 91 reviews. On Metacritic, it holds a rating of 86/100, based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". = A Private War = A Private War is a 2018 American biographical drama film directed by Matthew Heineman and starring Rosamund Pike as journalist Marie Colvin. The film is based on the 2012 article \\"Marie Colvin’s Private War\\" in Vanity Fair by Marie Brenner. The film was written by Arash Amel and features Jamie Dornan, Tom Hollander, and Stanley Tucci. The film premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States on November 2, 2018. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Pike's performance.

The district has a long history starting from the pre-historic times. During the early medieval period, the district was home to two of the four major kingdoms that ruled Kerala. Perumpadappu was the hometown of the Kingdom of Cochin, which is also known as Perumbadappu Swaroopam, and Nediyiruppu was the hometown of the Zamorin of Calicut, which is also known as Nediyiruppu Swaroopam.  Ancient period  Peutinger Table (north of Templ Augusti and Lacus Muziris) The remains of some pre-historic symbols including Dolmens, Menhirs, and Rock-cut caves have been found from various parts of the district. Rock-cut caves have been found from the places like Puliyakkode, Thrikkulam, Oorakam, Melmuri, Ponmala, Vallikunnu, and Vengara. The ancient maritime port of Tyndis, which was a centre of trade with Ancient Rome, is roughly identified with Ponnani and Tanur. Tyndis was a major center of trade, next only to Muziris, between the Cheras and the Roman Empire in the early centuries of the Christian era. A branch of the Chera royal family is also said to have established itself at Tyndis. It is also speculated that Tyndis (along with ports such as Naura, Bakare, and Nelkynda) operated as a satellite feeding port to Muziris.Coastal Histories: Society and Ecology in Pre-modern India, Yogesh Sharma, Primus Books 2010 During the Sangam period, the region was included in Kudanadu, a province in the Ancient Tamilakam. It was ruled by the ancient Chera dynasty.  Early medieval period  After the decline of the ancient Chera Dynasty, several dynasties controlled the area, and by the ninth century, the region came under the control of the Perumals of Mahodayapuram. A piece of inscriptional evidence found at Triprangode indicates that Goda Ravi of the Perumal dynasty controlled the present-day district in the early 10th century. Descriptions about the rulers of Eranad region and Valluvanad region can be seen in Jewish copper plates of Bhaskara Ravi Varman and Viraraghava copper plates of Veera Raghava Chakravarthy. After the disintegration of Perumal kingdom, a number of city-states emerged in the region, including Valluvanad, Vettathunadu (Tanur), Parappanad and Nediyiruppu (Eranad) (ruled by the Zamorins). Kottakkal, formerly known as Sweta Durgam (the White Fort) in Sanskrit, and Venkalikotta and Venkita Kotta in Malayalam, was a military base of the Kingdom of Valluvanadu in the medieval period. Nediyiruppu was the earlier capital of the Zamorins of Calicut. = Rise of the Zamorin of Calicut = During and around the fall of Perumal Empire, the neighbouring Calicut and its environs were ruled over by Porlathiri. The Eradis (A title used to denote the rulers of Eranad) of Nediyiruppu marched with their army to Panniyankara and often surrounded the headquarters of Porlathiri. The ultimate aim was to find access to the sea and thus to participate directly in the maritime trade. This war lasted for almost half a century. The battle ended in the victory of the Eradis. Porlathiri fled to Kolathunadu (a medieval kingdom centred at Kannur) in search of political asylum. With the conquest of Polanad, the Eradis who ruled Eranad shifted their headquarters from Nediyiruppu to Calicut, and later began to known as the Zamorin of Calicut. In the early stage of his territorial development, Zamorin expanded his territories to Parappanad and Vettathunad by defeating their rulers. The port of Ponnani was a prominent centre of Islamic learning and Tirunavaya was a centre of Vedic learning in medieval Kerala. The ports of Ponnani, Tanur and Parappanangadi had some of the oldest Muslim settlements in Kerala originated as a result of the trade relationship.  Late medieval period  Thunchan Smarakam at Tirur, in memory of Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan Valluvakonathiri, the ruler of Valluvanad, was the strongest rival the Zamorin had to face in the earlier stages of his imperial development. The immediate goal of Zamorin was to capture Tirunavaya on the bank of the river Bharathappuzha, which belonged to Valluvakonathiri. Tirunavaya, where the Mamankam festival was celebrated once in every twelve years under the presidency of the king of Valluvanad, was of great political significance in the medieval Kerala. The Zamorin lined up on one side and the Valluvakonathiri along with the ruler of Perumpadappu on the other. When the Zamorin's army reached north and settled at Triprangode, Eralpad, the young king of the Zamorin, reached Ponnani by sea, crossed the Bharathappuzha and settled on the other side of Tirunavaya. It was not too long before Valluvakonathiri had to concede defeat. The ruler of Perumpadappu, who fled away to Mahodayapuram, later established the Kingdom of Cochin headquartered at Kochi. Inspired by the victory at Tirunavaya, the Zamorin continued his attacks. Soon Nilambur, Manjeri, Malappuram, and Venkatakotta (Kottakkal) came under his control. Hence by the end of 13th century, majority of the district came under the control of Nediyiruppu Swaroopam.K. V. Krishna Ayyar, \\"The Kerala Mamankam\\" in Kerala Society Papers, Series 6, Trivandrum, 1928-32, pp. 324-30 However a small portion of the present Perinthalmanna subdistrict remained under the Kingdom of Valluvanad, including Angadipuram, which was the headquarters of the erstwhile Valluvanad. Under the Zamorin, the regions included in the district became leading destinations of trade with Arab merchants in medieval Kerala, along with Kozhikode. Thrikkavil Kovilakam in Ponnani served as a second home for Zamorin, and his navy headquarters.K. V. Krishna Iyer Zamorins of Calicut: From the Earliest Times to AD 1806. Calicut: Norman Printing Bureau, 1938 Archaeological relics found in Malappuram include the remnants of palaces of the eastern branch of the Zamorin reign. Malappuram was the military headquarters of the Zamorin in the Eranad region. The Zamorins held sway over Malappuram and their chieftain Para Nambi, ruled the area in early days with headquarters at Downhill (Kottappadi), Malappuram. Zamorin earned a greater part of his revenue by taxing the spice trade through his ports. Smaller ports in kingdom included Parappanangadi, Tanur, and Ponnani.K. V.

Padmanabha Menon, History of Kerala, Vol. II, Ernakulam, 1929, Vol. II, (1929) The modern Malayalam alphabet (accepted by Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan), and the Arabi-Malayalam script (also known as Ponnani script) were developed in the district during the medieval period. The Sanskrit works like Kokila Sandeśa (15th-century CE) written by Uddanda Śāstrī, Bhramara Sandesham (17th century CE) by Vasudevan, and Chathaka Sandesha (18th-century CE) have descriptions about Tirunavaya and Triprangode. Many medieval Malayalam works also help to trace the history of district. = Portuguese attempts of colonisation = The second home of Zamorin was situated near to the port of Ponnani. In the 16th century, the district witnessed several battles between Kozhikode naval chiefs, known as the Kunhali Marakkars, and the Portuguese colonizers. Towards the end of the year 1507, the Portuguese Viceroy Francisco de Almeida was informed that a column of 13 Muslim ships had taken cargo - mainly spices - from Ponnani and was about to leave for the Red Sea. The Viceroy immediately decided to corner the fleet. The decision was perhaps made with a view to retrieve the Portuguese prestige lost on account of some incidents at Angediva and Dabul. Almeida himself commandeered the fleet of 12 vessels consisting of four naus, six caravels, and two gales. The fleet had about 6,000 European soldiers, led by a collection of noblemen such as Pero Barreti, Diogo Pires, Lourenco de Almeida, and Nuno da Cunha, son of Tristao da Cunha and a handful of Cochin soldiers.K. S. Mathew, Shipbuilding, Navigation and the Portuguese in Pre-modern India Routledge, 2017 The defenses of the Ponnani Port were repaired and strengthened by the Zamorin after this event. The Zamorin appointed Kunjali Marakkar I, his loyal naval chief, in the port of Ponnani, to resist the Portuguese occupation. It is the known earliest navy in the Indian subcontinent. It seems that Kunjali Marakkar I, assisted by Kutti Ali and Pacchi Marakkar, subsequently constructed a naval base at Ponnani. Kutti Ali sent harassing raids from Ponnani to Cochin and reinforcement fleets to Kozhikode. In 1523 when the Viceroy Menezes sailed with all the available ships to Hormuz, an Arab merchant, one Kutti Ali of Tanur, had the effrontery to bring a fleet of two hundred vessels to Calicut, to load eight ships with pepper, and to despatch them with a convoy of forty vessels to the Red Sea before the very eyes of the Portuguese.William Logan. Malabar Manual, Volume 1 Asian Educational Services, 1887 The Zamorin later faced a protest in 1540 by Kutti Pocker, who is popularly known as Kunjali Marakkar II (a title given to the naval chief of the Zamorin) when the Zamorin signed a treaty with the Portuguese power in Ponnani. Tanur town was one of the earliest Portuguese colonies in the Indian subcontinent. In 1552, the Zamorin received assistance in heavy guns landed at Ponnani, brought by certain Yoosuf, a Turk, who had sailed against the monsoon winds. In 1566 and again in 1568, Kutti Pocker and his men captured two Portuguese ships. Around a thousand soldiers from one of these ships were killed either by the sword or drowning. Kutti Pocker was later in killed off the coast of Mangalore while returning from a successful raid on the Portuguese fort there. A Portuguese fleet of 40 vessels under the command of Diogo de Meneses is known to have pillaged Ponnani, sometime before 1570 AD.K. K. N. Kurup India's Naval Traditions Northern Book Centre, 1997K. M. Mathew. History of the Portuguese Navigation in India. Mittal Publications, 1988 - Goa, Daman and Diu (India) In 1571, the Zamorin sent against the Fort Chaliyam certain of his ministers in command over the Moors (a term used by William Logan to indicate Mappilas and Arab Merchants) of Ponnani, Tanur, and Parappanangadi, who was assisted by bodies of people from Chaliyam. The army led by troops of Zamorin won to seize the Portuguese fort at Chaliyam In 1573, Parappanangadi town was burnt by the Portuguese. In 1578, peace negotiations between Zamorin and the Portuguese were strengthened. However, the Zamorin refused to agree to construct a Portuguese fort at Ponnani. It is also known that Gil Eanes Mascarenhas opened fire from his ships to the port and killed a large number of natives in 1582. Mascarenhas was later captured and executed by the forces of Kunjali Marakkar.Teotonio R. De Souza.

Mappila Muslim Culture SUNY Press, 2015  Colonial period  Paloor Kotta near Perinthalmanna, where Tipu Sultan once sought asylum When William Keeling, a sea captain of English East India Company arrived at the Kingdom of Calicut in 1615, he was allowed to start warehouses in the port of Ponnani, through a treaty signed with the then Zamorin of Calicut. By the middle of the seventeenth century, the Dutch had attained monopoly over trade in many ports in Kerala. However, some factories in Ponnani came under the trade monopoly of English. During 18th century, the de facto Mysore kingdom rulers Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan marched into Zamorin's kingdom. With headquarters at Manjeri, Tipu's army was spread in many areas. Tipu had a fort at Paloor near Perinthalmanna on his way from Palakkad to the Zamorin's kingdom, where now a waterfall only remains. The Battle of Tirurangadi was a series of engagements that took place between the British army and Tipu Sultan between 7 and 12 December 1790 at Tirurangadi, during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. In 1792, Tipu Sultan was defeated by English East India Company through Third Anglo-Mysore War, and the Treaty of Seringapatam was agreed. As per this treaty, most of the Malabar region, including present-day Malappuram district, was integrated into the English East India Company. In 1793, the district became a part of the newly formed Malabar. On 20 May 1800, the East India Company separated Malabar from Bombay Presidency and annexed it with the Madras Presidency. The British had established a Barracks called Haig Barracks in the city of Malappuram, which has now been turned into Malappuram Collectorate. Malappuram acted as the military headquarters of British Malabar, as it was the centre of Malabar Special Police. The district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. It is estimated that there were about 830 riots, large and small, during this period. Muttichira revolt, Mannur revolt, Cherur revolt, Manjeri revolt, Wandoor revolt, Kolathur revolt, Ponnani revolt, and Thrikkalur revolt are some important revolts during this period. During 1841-1921 there were more than 86 revolutions against the British officials alone.K. Madhavan Nair, 'Malayalathile Mappila Lahala,' Mathrubhumi, 24 March 1923. East India Company made an arrangement to collect revenue through Zamorin. However, a revolt under the leadership of Manjeri Athan Gurukkal took place against this in 1849. The district was administered as parts of Eranad, Valluvanad and Ponnani subdistricts in the South Malabar region during the British rule. = Malabar Rebellion = A map of South Malabar during the Malabar rebellion in 1921 The Malabar district political conference of Indian National Congress held at Manjeri on 28 April 1920 strengthened Indian independence movement and national movement in British Malabar. That conference declared that the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms were not able to satisfy the needs of British India. It also argued for a land reform to seek solutions for the problems caused by tenancy that existed in Malabar. However, the decision widened the drift between extremists and moderates within the Congress. The conference resulted in the dissatisfaction of landlords with the Indian National Congress. It caused the leadership of the Malabar district Congress Committee to come under the control of the extremists who stood for labourers and the middle class. Malappuram has been part of Khilafat Movement just after the Manjeri conference. Though the Khilafat movement was initiated as a nonviolent resistance in Malabar, the Khilafat non-cooperation demonstration conducted at Kalpakanchery in Ponnani Taluk (now a part of Tirur Taluk) on 22 March 1921 showed a deviation from the concept of non-violence. The first all Kerala provincial conference of Indian National Congress held at Ottapalam in April 1921 also influenced the rebellion. Malabar Rebellion of 1921 was the last and important among the Mappila rebellions. The cities/towns of Malappuram, Manjeri, Kondotty, Perinthalmanna, and Tirurangadi were the main strongholds of the rebels. The Battle of Pookkottur occurred as a part of the rebellion. After the army, police, and British authorities fled, the declaration of independence took place over 200 villages in Eranad, Valluvanad, Ponnani, and Kozhikode taluks.Malabar Desiyathayude Idapedalukal. Dr. M. T. Ansari. DC Books The new country was given the name Malayala Rajyam (The land of Malayalam).R. H. Hitch cock, 1983 Peasant revolt in Malabar, History of Malabar Rebellion 1921. On August 25, 1921, Variyan Kunnathu Kunjahammed Haji inaugurated the Military Training Center at Angadipuram, which was started by the revolutionary government. The feudal customs of Kumpil Kanji and Kanabhumi were abolished and the tenants were made landowners. A tax exemption was given for one year and a tax was imposed on the movement of goods from Wayanad to Tamil Nadu.Madras Mail 17 September 1921, p 8 Similar to the British, the structure of administration was built upon Collector, Governor, Viceroy, and King.‘particularly strong evidence of the moulding influence of British power structures lies in the rebels constant use of British titles to authority such as Assistant Inspector, Collector, Governor, Viceroy and (less conclusively) King’ The Moplah Rebellion and Its Genesis 184 The parallel government established courts, tax centers, food storage centers, the military, and the legal police. Passport system was introduced for those in the new country.‘The rebel kists’, martial law, tolls, passports and, perhaps, the concept of a Pax Mappila, are to all appearances traceable to the British empire in India as a prototype’ The Moplah Rebellion and Its Genesis, Peoples Publishing House, 1987, 183 Although the nation's lifespan is less than six months, some British officials have suggested that the region was ruled by a parallel government for more than a year.F.

R., ‘Summary of the Important Events of the Rebellion,’ in Tottenham, Mapilla Rebellion) 1921 dated Sept 15 no 367 The Wagon tragedy memorial at Tirur The rebels won to establish self-rule in the region for about six months. However less than six months after the declaration of autonomy, the East India Company reclaimed the territory and annexed it to the British Raj. The war was directly controlled by British Army Commander-in-Chief Chief Rawlson, General Barnett Stuart, Intelligence Chief Maurice Williams, and Police General Armitage. Many of the important British military regiments including Dorset, Karen, Yenier, Linston, Rajputana, Gorkha, Garwale, and Chin Kutchin reached Malabar for the reannexation of the South Malabar.Home (Pol) Department, Government of India, File No. 241/XVI,/1922, Telegram Section, p.3, TNA The Wagon tragedy (1921) is still a saddening memory of the Malabar rebellion, where 64 prisoners died on 20 November 1921.Panikkar, K. N., Against Lord and State: Religion and Peasant Uprisings in Malabar 1836-1921 The prisoners had been taken into custody following the Mappila Rebellion in various parts of the district. Their deaths through apparent negligence generated sympathy for Indian independence movement.  Post-colonial period  Malabar remained as a part of the state of Madras for a few years after the declaration of Indian independence. Malappuram was one of the five revenue divisions in the Malabar district with the Taluks of Eranad (headquartered at Manjeri) and Valluvanad (headquartered at Perinthalmanna) under its jurisdiction, while the other four being Thalassery, Kozhikode, Palakkad and Fort Cochin. Later in 1956, Malabar merged with the erstwhile state of Travancore-Cochin to form Kerala following the linguistic reorganisation of states. The newly merged Malabar was divided into Kannur, Kozhikode, and Palakkad in 1957. The Eranad Taluk of erstwhile Malappuram revenue division was added to the new Kozhikode district and Valluvanad Taluk was added to Palakkad. Large-scale changes in the territorial jurisdiction of the region took place between 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, the Tirur subdistrict was formed by adjoining major portions of the Eranad and Ponnani subdistricts. Another portion of the Ponnani subdistrict was carved out to form Chavakkad subdistrict (in Thrissur district), and the remainder is the present-day Ponnani. Perinthalmanna was formed by carving out some portions from the erstwhile Valluvanad subdistrict. Of these, Eranad and Tirur subdistricts remained in Kozhikode district, while Perinthalmanna and Ponnani subdistricts continued in Palakkad. The district of Malappuram was formed with four subdistricts (Eranad, Perinthalmanna, Tirur, and Ponnani), four towns, fourteen developmental blocks, and 100 Gram panchayats. Later, three more subdistricts- Tirurangadi, Nilambur, and Kondotty- were formed from Tirur and Eranad. In the early years of Communist rule in Kerala, Malappuram experienced land reform under the Land Reform Ordinance. In the 1970s, the oil reserves in the Persian Gulf countries were opened to commercial extraction and thousands of unskilled workers migrated to the gulf. They sent money home, supporting the rural economy, and by the late 20th century, the region attained First World health standards and near-universal literacy.

It includes activities such as lead-based paint inspections, risk assessments and lead-based paint removal. In the United States, lead abatement activities are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Lead abatement companies are governed by the EPA and the EPA requires individuals and firms that conduct lead-based paint activities, including abatement, to be licensed. The lead abatement company, its supervisors, and all of the workers have to take classes and receive a certificate of completion. State agencies work with the EPA to enforce state and Federal laws. Lead abatement is distinguished from Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) programs, which are typically performed at the option of the property owner for aesthetic or other reasons, or as an interim control to minimize lead hazards.

Contact Dermatitis due to irritation is inflammation of the skin which results from a contact with an irritant. It has been observed that this type of dermatitis does not require prior sensitization of the immune system. There have been studies to support that past or present atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for this type of dermatitis. Common irritants include detergents, acids, alkalies, oils, organic solvents and reducing agents. Clinical manifestations of the contact dermatitis are also modified by external factors such as environmental factors (mechanical pressure, temperature, and humidity) and predisposing characteristics of the individual (age, sex, ethnic origin, preexisting skin disease, atopic skin diathesis, and anatomic region exposed. Another occupational skin disease is glove-related hand urticaria, believed to be caused by repeated wearing and removal of the gloves. It has been reported as an occupational problem among the health care workers. The reaction is caused by the latex or the nitrile present in the gloves.Glove-related hand urticaria: an increasing occupational problem amongst health care workers. Hawkey S, Abdul Ghaffar S. Types The acute form of this dermatitis develops on exposure of the skin to a strong irritant or caustic chemical. This exposure can occur as a result of accident at a workplace . The irritant reaction starts to increase in its intensity within minutes to hours of exposure to the irritant and reaches its peak quickly. After the reaction has reached its peak level, it starts to heal. This process is known as decrescendo phenomenon. The most frequent potent irritants leading to this type of dermatitis are acids and alkaline solutions. The symptoms include redness and swelling of the skin along with the formation of blisters. The chronic form occurs as a result of repeated exposure of the skin to weak irritants over long periods of time. Prevention Prevention measures include avoidance of the irritant through its removal from the workplace or through technical shielding by the use of potent irritants in closed systems or automation, irritant replacement or removal and personal protection of the workers. Low quality evidence exists for the effectiveness of certain therapies and their ability to specifically prevent hand skin irritation in the workplace. The limited evidence that does exist suggests that moisturizers used alone or in combination with a barrier cream can result in a clinically beneficial effect in the long or short-term primary prevention of occupational irritant hand dermatitis.Bauer A, Rönsch H, Elsner P, Dittmar D, Bennett C, Schuttelaar MA, Lukács J, John S, Williams HC.

Al-Qilai entered in the Franciscan Order to 1470 and was consecrated bishop of Maronites in Cyprus in 1507. Biography Information about Gabriel al-Qilai are mostly found in the work of the historiographical patriarch Estephan El Douaihy, which greatly was inspired by him. Defending the idea of perpetual Roman orthodoxy of the Maronites, the Patriarch Douaihy fought against the idea that Ibn al-Qilai had converted to Catholicism in 1494.[Apology of the Maronites, Book II, § 14.] Gabriel al-Qilai was son of Butrus al-Qilā'i and was born in the village of Lehfed. The word Qilā'i refers to a house in a rocky area.[Bayn al-Qila 'means \\"among the rocks.\\"] According to custom, he was entrusted to a priest named Ibrāhīm ibn Dray to learn from him the Syriac and the reading of the liturgical books. According to the Patriarch Douaihy he was attacked in his youth of ophthalmia which was the cause of his breakup with his fiancee and his withdrawal from society. Towards 1470, he went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem with another young man named John.[Gabriel and Jean were accompanied by a third named François according to some sources.] In this city he adhered the Custody of the Holy Land of the Franciscan order. The recruitment of two young Maronites in the order was assigned by the Flemish brother Gryphon of Courtrai (1405 - died at St. Francis Convent in Famagusta on 18 July 1475), attached in 1450 to his death at the Franciscan mission of Mount Lebanon and loaded relations with the Maronites. The two youth Lebanese complete their last year of novitiate in the convent of Mount Zion. After their vows, they were sent to Venice to complete their training. Gabriel followed to Italy (in Venice and Rome) to study liberal arts and theology that lasted at least seven years. He himself said that he stayed in Rome for seven months and performs with his friend Jean theological training at Aracoeli convent. In the eulogy he made with his friend John in Italy when they were often subjected to people who accused the Maronite Church from heresy a vigorous defence of their church. Both were ordained priests in Italy. They did back to the East probably in 1483/85. Then, until his episcopal consecration in 1507, the life of Ibn al-Qilai took place between Qannoubine (center of the Maronite Church), Beirut (where there was a Franciscan monastery, Saint-Sauveur) and Jerusalem (where there was a Franciscan monastery, Mount Zion). At that time, the Maronite Church was very torn between his long-standing ties with the papacy and the very strong presence in Lebanon of the Jacobite Church, of which it was culturally very close (liturgy, use of Western Syriac). Noah Lebanese Bqoufa (born in Ehden, in the heart of the Maronite country) was Patriarch of Antioch of the Jacobites from 1493 to 1509. There were no less than two convents in the region of Ehden that were occupied by Ethiopian monks members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, in the same communion that the Syriac Orthodox Church). Also a muqaddam (local chief) named Abdel Min'im Ayyub († 1495) had joined the Jacobite cause. Ibn al-Qilai was particularly devoted to the fight against the Jacobite influences (who won, apparently, his native village of Lehfed and of his relatives) to secure the Maronites to the Catholic Church. On November 23, 1494, the Franciscan friar Francesco Suriano, then custos of the Holy Land, sent an unfriendly letter to Maronite Patriarch Simeon Hadath: he marveled that he was elected in 1492 but has not yet sent anyone to Rome to request the pallium (the confirmation of his election); \\"enemies\\" of the new primate, grouped in Cyprus where the Maronite Church was well established, accused him of breaking the union with the papacy; Suriano asked the Patriarch to justify and renew in writing, with the bishops, priests and lay leaders of the Maronite nation, their membership of the Catholic Church. Then Gabriel ibn al-Qilai was sent by Suriano to investigate charges and collect the new act of faith of the patriarch and his people. Ibn al-Qilai devoted himself to this task in Lebanon until at least 1499. In 1507, the bishop of the Maronites of Cyprus Joseph Kasaphani died and he was elected to succeed him. He first lived in the Saints Nuhra and Anthony convent of Nicosia, the traditional seat of the Maronite bishops, and then transferred the seat to Saint-Georges Convent of Tala. Relations between the Maronite and Latin hierarchies in Cyprus were appalling: in 1514, Ibn al-Qilai wrote to Pope Leo X to complain about the nuisance that the Latin bishops to property inflicted the great Maronite monastery of Saint John Khuzbandu.[now disappeared Monastery, which was probably not far from the Greek monastery St. John Chrysostom Koutsovendis.] The pope replied in 1515, confirming the rights of the Maronites and sent two other letters on this subject, to the Latin archbishop and the Venetian governor of the island. Bishop al-Qilai died in 1516 in Cyprus. Work Gabriel ibn al-Qilai authored abundant literary works, mixing treated in prose and poetry, making him the first modern Maronite writer. The Maronite historians of the 17th and 18th centuries (Antoine Faustus Nairon,[Antoine Faustus Nairon (real Arabic name Merhej Mikhael ibn ibn Nimroun), born in Rome in 1628 of a native of Bane family in Lebanon, also died in Rome in 1711, brother or nephew of Abraham Ecchellensis and his successor as professor of Syriac at the College of Wisdom in Rome, author of two books on the history of the Maronites: origin Dissertatio, ac nomine religione Maronitarum (1679) and Euoplia fidei Catholicae ex Syrorum monumentis adversus AEVI novatores nostri (1694 ).] Estephan El Douaihy and Giuseppe Simone Assemani) were largely dependent him. In addition he translated into Arabic many texts in Latin or Italian from the Latin Church, introducing the literature of the latter among Maronites.

She was one of the first women to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree, specifically in obstetrics and gynecology.  Domestic life  Mercy Ruggles was born in Hardwick, Massachusetts on September 17, 1802, to Constant Ruggles, Esq. and his wife. This was a point in history where women were still held back in many ways, including education and the job field; they were simply not given the same opportunities for advancement that males were. Many women were given no other options than to stay at home with their children and spend their days in a much more private sphere of life. For women who were interested in the healthcare field and able to get jobs, they would typically work as nurses, midwives, or 'healers'. Jackson was able to attend school, and at the age of 17 she graduated from a private school in Hardwick. Jackson was already paving the way for many young women to follow in her footsteps. At the age of 17 Jackson was already striving to break into the heavily male-dominated medical field. Shortly after her graduation, Jackson moved to Plainfield to take up a temporary teaching job. At the end of this, she moved closer to home again, soon after meeting her first husband John Bisbee whom she married in 1823. Jackson and Bisbee had three children together, one of whom died in infancy from Scarlet fever, and another dying of Pneumonia in 1832. Jackson was left a widow in 1829 when Bisbee died unexpectedly from pneumonia. This left Jackson alone and with an opportunity to open a school for young ladies, giving them a very basic education. Very shortly after, Jackson met her second husband Capt. Daniel Jackson who had four children from a previous marriage. Jackson cared for these children as her own. Together, they moved to Plymouth in the year 1833, right after they were married. Over the course of their time together, Mercy and Daniel had eight children together, only four of whom survived. All together Mercy bore eleven children, and mothered fifteen. This was part of what fueled her interest gynecology, and medical research as a whole. While in Plymouth, Massachusetts, Mercy practiced medicine as well as she could with no formal education background; working all 18 years while she lived there. But sadly, after 19 years of marriage, her second husband died of cancer in 1852. At this point Mercy started to get even more serious than before with her studies; she felt that in order to further her success she must receive a much more formal education and training. Jackson returned to school in her 50s to study homeopathy.  Education  She graduated from a private school at age 17. At the age of 58, Jackson earned the Doctor of Medicine degree at Boston's New England Female Medical College (1860) now known as Boston University School of Medicine.  Career in homeopathy  Mercy B. Jackson was heavily involved in American Homeopathy in the 19th century, even attending a few conventions as a speaker and presenter. Jackson specialized in Obstetrics and Gynaecology with a heavy focus on uterine hemorrhaging. Problems such as 'displacement of the uterus' were common in this time, and it was thought to affect a woman's ability to bear children, and even her overall health and wellbeing. The suggested treatments for this were no better than the actual problem, as most of them such as scarification, electricity, cauterization, and abdominal supporters were very dangerous to a women's health. As for uterine hemorrhaging, the most common treatment was simply putting ice on it and hoping that the bleeding would stop. Jackson was one of many homeopaths that took an interest in changing this practice in order to make it more comfortable for the patient and less damaging. By word of mouth, Jackson became known to many women across the country. She was preferred by many because she was a woman due to the fact that it was frowned upon for a female to have a male gynecologist. She was known to give women the right medication that they so badly needed; she was not known to have patients with persistent symptoms even after treatment. After becoming very well known very quickly, Mercy became the first woman to be inducted into the American Institute of Homeopathy. Mercy had a very fulfilling career, as homeopathy very quickly gained popularity as Jackson was attending school and just beginning her practices. Throughout Jackson's life she was mentioned in many homeopathic journals in both the United States and Britain.

Parallax measurements performed by the Gaia spacecraft provide a distance estimate of roughly . This is a K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K1III: − the colon suffix indicates some uncertainty in the luminosity classification of III. Spectroscopic analysis of the star was used to derive an estimated mass of about 1.81 times the mass of the Sun. It has an estimated age of 1.6 billion years; old enough at that mass to have evolved off the main sequence. As a giant star, the atmosphere has expanded to 7.3 times the Sun's radius, and it is emitting 26 times the solar luminosity at an effective temperature of 4,772 K. The projected rotational velocity of the star is 4.3 km/s, indicating it is rotating with a period of under 86 days. In 2016, a team of astronomers reported the detection of a pair of giant planetary companions. Radial velocity measurements indicated gravitational perturbations of the star being caused by orbiting objects. The best fit to the preliminary data suggests two periodicities: one almost exactly a year long like the Earth's periodicity, and a second of around two years. Both objects are predicted to have masses greater than that of the planet Jupiter: their minimum masses are 1.8 and 1.9 Jupiter masses, respectively. Until the inclination of their orbits is known, their actual masses cannot be pinned down more accurately.

History  Thor was founded in 1893 by four men: John D. Hurley, Edward Hurley, John Patrick Hopkins, and Roger Charles Sullivan.[i] In 1894, another Thor brother, Neil C. Hurley Sr., was added to the Thor board of directors. The company would soon be organized and later known as the Independent Pneumatic Tool Company. The railroad industry first brought success to Thor. Its first product was the \\"Thor\\" pneumatic hammer to pound rivets and drill holes for bolts used to fasten the fire box of a locomotive to its boiler. The name \\"Thor\\" referred to: Thor, the mythical god of thunder, frequently pictured as wielding a mighty hammer. The name became popular and spread to other company products.[vi] The first factory was part of what had been a corset factory in Aurora, Illinois. Soon, they occupied the entire building. Railroads continued to be the major customers of the company's pneumatic products during these early years. The Thor enterprise had been organized into two companies at first: one to handle manufacturing, and the other to handle sales. Although he took no part in the management, \\"Diamond\\" Jim Brady allowed his name to be used as President of the fledgling company for several years. It was a marketing ploy, for Brady was the nation's best known salesman and promoter at that time.[ii] Thor soon acquired another factory, the Aurora Automatic Machinery Company. This company made parts for bicycles and motorcycles, including the Sears and Indian motorcycles. Part of this company was in Aurora and the other part was in Chicago. This acquisition took place near the turn of the century and the Thor Building in downtown Chicago came into being. , Thor manufactured motorcycles from the early 1900s until 1918. It was Thor that introduced to the world the first sidecar for motorcycles.[iii] The decision to get out of the motorcycle business was entirely financial. There simply was more money to be made in tools, including the tools that made motorcycles, than the actual motorcycles themselves.[iv] As the company grew during the first decade of the twentieth century, it made four prototypes of the Thor automobile between 1909 and 1910. Unfortunately, the car, a giant six cylinder touring car, proved too costly to produce profitably and the idea was dropped.[v] In 1906, Neil C. Hurley, Sr., and his brother, Edward Hurley, formed the Hurley Machine Company. Their initial product was the first electric washing machine in the world, the Thor washing machine. Although the tool company and the washing machine company were two separate entities, the name \\"Thor\\" had acquired a reputation for quality and dependability. It is unclear how these two Hurley brothers, Neil and Edward, received permission to use the Thor logo and name on its new venture, but the fact that another brother co-founded the tool company no doubt played an instrumental role. Perhaps the tool division felt that the use of the Thor name and logo on household products would provide good advertising. At any rate, the Hurley Machine Company was now in business producing Thor washing machines using the same logo that had been used by the Independent Pneumatic Tool Company and the Aurora Automatic Machinery Company for the Thor motorcycle. There was never any corporate or financial relationship between the washing machine company and the power tool company. Neil C. Hurley. Sr., had retired from the board of directors of the tool company before assuming leadership of the Hurley Machine Company. The appearance of the Thor product name and the Hurley family name for both companies continues to cause some confusion, but at least it stayed within the Hurley brothers family and there never seemed to be any legal acrimony over the logo use among all three companies.[vii] John D. Hurley, one of the co-founders of the Independent Pneumatic Tool Company, died in 1928. Ralph Cooper, a veteran with the company, headed the business until Neil C. Hurley, Sr., succeeded him as president of the tool company, consolidating power under his name.[viii] Shortly after introducing the electric washing machine, the two Hurley brothers, Neil and Edward, introduced the Thor rotary iron, commonly known as the \\"Gladiron\\" as opposed to the hand-held \\"sad irons\\" of the day that required stove top heating by the user. Several variations of the \\"Gladiron\\" were introduced. One model would serve as an actual attachment to the washing machine. These early washing machines had wringers at the top; by taking off the wringer and attaching the gladiron, the \\"woman of the house\\", or her domestic servant, could do their ironing above the machine. The other model was a portable stand-alone model. The Hurley Machine Company advertised heavily to women and the term, \\"woman of the house\\", aptly applies to the domestic position viewed by society of many women at that time. It is not used pejoratively and should not reflect the attitude of society towards women today. Both the washing machine and gladiron were big hits in households throughout the country and the world. The Arcade Toy Company made tiny replicas of both machines for doll houses. In 1920, the Hurley Machine Company introduced the Thor vacuum cleaner, believed to be the first electric vacuum cleaner manufactured in the United States.[ix] Sometime during the 1920s, the Hurley Machine Company became a subsidiary of the newly formed Electric Household Utilities Corporation, still under the control of the Hurley brothers. In 1929, the Hurley Machine Company acquired the Juvenator exercise belt product. This product would hook to any door and allow the user to slip the belt around their waist and vibrate their pounds away. While this should have proved dynamically successful, once the depression hit, like so many good products, the Juvenator disappeared from the marketplace in the early thirties. Neil C. Hurley, Jr., succeeded his father as president of Thor in 1944. Neil C. Hurley, Sr., the co-founder of the company, passed away in 1948. In 1953, the company recognized the impact of the Thor name and officially adopted it as the corporate title, Thor Power Tool Company. Using the established Thor logo, Thor Power Tool Company manufactured a broad line of industrial, service, mining, and household tools—some of which were operated by air, some by electricity, and some by gasoline.[x] Rotary pneumatic tools replaced the large, heavy piston type in 1928. New line followed new line as the years passed. Auto and aircraft makers succeeded railroads as Thor's biggest customers. In 1951, overseas manufacturing and distribution were expanded with the purchase of Armstrong-Whitworth and Co., in England.[xi] In 1954, Thor acquired Speedway Manufacturing, makers of the Speedway line of tools, including the famous Silverline. Thor's other properties included the Cincinnati Rubber Manufacturing Company, a farm living research center near Huntley, Ill., and Drying Systems, Inc., which made smokehouses, among other items. By 1959, Thor Power Tool Company's annual volume had surpassed $30 million.[xii] By the early sixties, Thor Power Tool Company was acquired by the Stewart-Warner Corporation. A short time later, Neil C. Hurley, Jr. died from a third heart attack, February 9, 1965, at the age of 54 and the Thor brand name almost died. New incarnation In the early part of the twenty- first century, the Thor name and logo was resurrected on washing machines manufactured from Australia. The new company had no ties with the original company, other than the use of the Thor logo and name.

QM44 service only operates during rush hours in the peak direction. History A QM4 under Queens Surface operation in Midtown Manhattan. In November 1949, the Queens Valley Home Owners' Association of Kew Gardens Hills proposed an extension of the city's Q44 Vleigh Place shuttle bus (later the ) west from its northern terminus at Jewel Avenue and Main Street to the 71st–Continental Avenues subway station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line in Forest Hills, to give Kew Gardens Hills additional bus service. It would have created a loop service between the 71st Avenue station and the nearby Kew Gardens-Union Turnpike station on the same line, running via Main Street. The proposed route was numbered Q75. The Q75 proposal was submitted to the New York City Board of Transportation on March 20, 1951. On June 19, transit officials informed the Board of Estimate it would not be advisable to extend that route. In response, Queens–Nassau Transit (the predecessor to the Queens Surface Corporation) proposed that the Q65A bus run along the entire length of Jewel Avenue between 164th Street to the 71st Avenue station at Queens Boulevard. In an alternate proposal, Queens–Nassau Transit proposed having the route terminate at the 75th Avenue subway station, between the 71st Avenue and Union Turnpike stops. The Q65A's introduction was also meant to help alleviate congestion at the Union Turnpike subway station. The Queens Valley Association opposed the Q65A proposal, due to it only serving the northern portion of Kew Gardens Hills. It also opposed placing the terminus at the 75th Avenue station, since 75th Avenue only serves local trains, while 71st Avenue and Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike serve both local and express trains. The Board of Estimate approved Queens-Nassau Transit's proposal on August 17, 1951. On November 14, 1951, bus service began on the Q65A. The route was originally a spur of the , for which the bus route was named. On August 2, 1953, the Q65A's terminal route was changed. Originally, the Q65A bus traveled east on Jewel Avenue all the way to 164th Street, until it made a loop and reversed direction at 165th Street. The route was changed so that buses would turn south on Parsons Boulevard, east on 71st Avenue, and then north on 164th Street to the terminus at Jewel Avenue; this routing is still used by the current Q64 bus. The change was met with resentment from the local community due to concerns that buses would hit kids outside the newly opened Public School 200 at 164th Street and 71st Avenue. Queens-Nassau became the Queens Transit Corporation in 1957. In 1964, City Councilman Seymour Boyers of Flushing proposed extending the Q65A to 188th Street and 73rd Avenue, via 164th Street and 73rd Avenue. The proposed extension would have provided additional access to Queens College, providing an alternate route to the , would provide an access route to the World's Fair, and it would provide access to the IND subway station at 71st Avenue, which would have relieved congestion at the Kew Gardens-Union Turnpike subway station. Queens Transit Corporation began operating the QM4 on August 16, 1971. The route was not originally given a number, and was instead called the Jewel Avenue–Flushing/Hillcrest Express. Originally some buses started at Kissena Boulevard instead of at the Long Island Expressway.* * The bus company became Queens-Steinway Transit Corporation in 1986, before finally becoming Queens Surface Corporation in 1988. =MTA takeover= A Q64 bus entering service in Forest Hills in 2011, when the route was still dispatched from the College Point Depot. On February 27, 2005, the MTA Bus Company took over the operations of the Queens Surface routes as part of the city's takeover of all the remaining privately operated bus routes. On September 2, 2007, the Q65A was renumbered to the Q64. Until 2010, the Q64 operated out of College Point Depot (the former Queens Surface garage), but has since been operating out of the Baisley Park Depot (the former Jamaica Buses facility) in South Jamaica In January 2020, the QM4 and QM44 routes were moved back into College Point depot due to lack of express buses in Baisley Park depot. On September 8, 2013, overnight service was added making the Q64 a 24/7 bus route and eliminating the 90 minute gap in service between 2:30 AM and 4:00 AM. On July 5, 2016, the branch of the QM4 along Third Avenue was relabeled as the QM44 as part of the renumbering of Queens express routes' Third Avenue branches.

It is in three movements with a total duration in performance of about eight minutes. History Alcancías, in the form of piggy banks, Feria de alfarería de Zamora 2012 Alcancías takes as its subject a very typical product of Mexican popular art, those multicolored pottery penny-banks, usually small and in the form of a pig or fish, which generally must be broken in order to remove the money inside . The work was composed in the first half of 1932, and was completed in July . Instrumentation Alcancías is scored for a chamber orchestra of piccolo, oboe, E clarinet, B clarinet, horn, 2 trumpets in C, trombone, timpani, percussion (xylophone, maracas, snare drum, suspended cymbals, güiro, bass drum) and strings. Despite the absence of the instrument in the score, cites Alcancías as one of several Revueltas compositions in which the tuba is prominent. Analysis Alcancía in the form of an altar boy Alcancías consists of three movements: #Allegro #Andante #Allegro vivo The first movement has a complex and unorthodox three-part architectural structure; the second, lyrical movement is in essence a folk song; and the last movement has the character of a lively traditional huapango . An off- balance five-bar introduction featuring melodic fragments with strong accents on the off-beats leads to the opening theme of the first main section, a folk- like melody in parallel thirds . The movement can be described as modernist, angular, motoric, and tonally ambiguous. It is in a three-part, ABC form, in which each section consists of three smaller units. \\"It serves as an excellent example of Revueltas’s predilection for triple subdivisions and the creative way in which he applied and combined them to create extended, more elaborate forms\\" . The second movement is in a contrasting lyrical, tonal, and folk-like style, suggesting a melancholy canción ranchera. An eight-bar introduction is followed by a first verse (b. 9–31), an eight-bar interlude, a second verse (b. 40–59), and a concluding eight-bar coda . The scoring here features unison violins together with piccolo and oboe in thirds, and the E-flat clarinet entering after an oboe solo and a trio of horn, trumpet, and trombone . The strings and winds in the high register above a rumbling accompaniment creates a moment of tension that \\"extends beyond everything and suggests a disruption of the underworld\\" . In the third movement, Revueltas's chief goal is to place elements of Mexican popular music in the foreground. Formal aspects take a secondary place to the natural developmental unfolding of folk thematic material in the improvisatory manner characteristic of the huapango .

Members of the CCC family are found in animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. Most characterized CCC family proteins are from higher eukaryotes, but one has been partially characterized from Nicotiana tabacum (a plant), and homologous ORFs have been sequenced from Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Synechococcus sp. (blue green bacterium). The latter proteins are of unknown function. These proteins show sequence similarity to members of the APC family (TC #2.A.3). CCC family proteins are usually large (between 1000 and 1200 amino acyl residues), and possess 12 putative transmembrane spanners (TMSs) flanked by large N-terminal and C-terminal hydrophilic domains. Function CCC family proteins can catalyze NaCl/KCl symport, NaCl symport, or KCl symport depending on the system. The NaCl/KCl symporters are specifically inhibited by bumetanide while the NaCl symporters are specifically inhibited by thiazide. One member of the CCC family, the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC) of man is involved in 5% of the filtered load of NaCl in the kidney. Mutations in NCC cause the recessive Gitelman syndrome. NCC is a dimer in the membrane. It is regulated by RasGRP1. Transport reaction The generalized transport reaction for CCC family symporters is: :{Na+ \\\\+ K+ \\\\+ 2Cl−} (out) ⇌ {Na+ \\\\+ K+ \\\\+ 2Cl−} (in). That for the NaCl and KCl symporters is: :{Na+ or K+ \\\\+ Cl−} (out) ⇌ {Na+ or K+ \\\\+ Cl−} (in). Structure NCC proteins are dimers in the membrane and contain 12 TMSs. Two splice variants of NKCC2 are identical except for a 23 aa membrane domain. They have different affinities for Na+, K+ and Cl−. This segment (residues 216-233 in NKCC2) were examined for ion selectivity. Residue 216 affects K+ binding while residue 220 only affects Na+ binding. These two sites are presumed to be adjacent to each other. Each of the major types of CCC family members in mammals exist as paralogous isoforms. These may differ in substrates transported. For example, of the four currently recognized KCl transporters, KCC1 and KCC4 both recognize KCl with similar affinities, but KCC1 exhibits anion selectivity: Cl− > SCN− = Br− > PO > I−, while KCl4 exhibits anion selectivity: Cl− > Br− > PO = I− > SCN−. Both are activated by cell swelling under hypotonic conditions. These proteins may cotransport water (H2O). CCCs share a conserved structural scaffold that consists of a transmembrane transport domain followed by a cytoplasmic regulatory domain. Warmuth et al. (2009) determined the x-ray structure of the C-terminal domain of a CCC from the archaeon Mehanosarcina acetivorans ().

Later this proposal was not ratified by Emperor Francis Joseph I.  Moravian Compromise  On November 27, 1905, leading members in Moravian Diet of the Czech (speaking) and German (speaking) communities in Moravia agreed to a political compromise that divided power in the provincial diet between Czechs, Germans, and members of the landowning and ecclesiastical aristocracy. The Moravian CompromiseThe Moravian Compromise: light at the end of the tunnel? was one of the few positive examples of an approach to a fair solution in the field of nationalities policies. Despite the deadlock in the language dispute between Czechs and Germans, a compromise acceptable to both sides and allowing a harmonious coexistence was found here. The Moravian Compromise of 1905 was a root a compromise over what national equality of rights meant. Czech and German understanding of it, and the compromise between them, even found numerical expression - in the proportions set be by Compromise for staffing nationally shared public institutions, such as crownland legistrature and administration, and for funding nationally partitioned ones, such as school. The electoral conditions were altered so as to include in addition to the three electoral classes of the great landowners, the taxpayers in urban areas, and the taxpayers in rural districts a fourth universal electoral class consisting of every qualified voter; separate German and Czech electoral districts were established according to the national land registers, and Curia of the separate nationalities were instituted to settle all disputes involving the question on nationality. The question of language in the case of the autonomous national and district authorities has been settled on a bilingual basis, and the division of the school board according to nationality accomplished. Although, by the acceptance of this franchise reform, the Germans lost their previous majority in the Diet, they gave their consent to the change in the interests of public peace. Politically speaking the Margraviate of Moravia is an Austrian crown land, the highest administrative authority being vested in the governor at Brno. The Diet consists of 149 deputies: 2 members with individual vote, the Archbishop of Olomouc and the Bishop of Brno; 30 members of the landed interests (10 German, 20 Czech); 3 deputies from the Chamber of Commerce of Brno and from that of Olomouc; 40 representatives of the towns (20 German, 20 Czech); 51 representatives of the rural communes (14 German); 20 deputies from the electoral curia (6 German).

He was a patron of New Zealand's involvement in international yachting. He was the driving force in the development of Crown Lynn, a ceramics manufacturer begun by his great-grandfather Rice Owen Clark in the mid 1850s. Early life and family Clark was born in Hobsonville on 6 August 1916. His father was also called Thomas Edwin Clark and his mother was Margaret Clark (née Morison). He attended King's College in Auckland but was pulled out of school in 1931 during the Great Depression, as the family could not afford the school fees, and was sent to work in the family's brick works instead. Clark married three times and had nine children. Business career During World War II, the country started running out of cups and saucers, as they were no longer imported and had never been manufactured locally at a grand scale. Clark Jr. started experimenting with mass production and built a tunnel kiln after reading as much about it as he could. Initially, he did not know how to attach handles successfully, and the Crown Lynn Potteries brand had a reputation into the 1950s for handles that broke off. By 1948, more than half of the company's production was sold to Australia, but when the Minister of Finance, Walter Nash, changed the exchange rate by 25%, that overseas market was \\"lost overnight\\". The company had a supply contract with the New Zealand Railways Department, and the railway cup and saucer are regarded as \\"one of the most famous Kiwi icons of the twentieth century\\". The name of Crown Lynn was changed to Ceramco in 1974, and the company diversified into areas like electronics and the wholesale of appliances. The lingerie company, Bendon, was purchased at that time. The pottery part of the business was shut down in 1989 due to cheap imports. Clark retired from Ceramco in 1993, after 62 years with the business. Honours Clark was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1986 New Year Honours, for services to manufacturing, export, sport and the community. In February 2005, Clark was presented the Key to the City from Bob Harvey, the mayor of Waitakere City. Death Clark died on 14 June 2005 and was survived by his third wife, Patricia, Lady Clark. His funeral service was held at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Parnell, and he was cremated at Waikumete Crematorium.

The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2016. It was released on September 2, 2016, by FilmRise. Plot Leah, a young university student, moves in with her best friend Katie into an apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. One night, after they run out of marijuana, she approaches a group of young Latino men on her corner asking them to sell her drugs. They refuse. Later she invites one of the men, Blue, into her apartment, who explains that while he is a cocaine dealer, he refuses to do hard drugs. Blue and Leah end up having sex on her rooftop. After seeing the drugs that Blue deals, Leah tells him he could easily be making $60 compared to the $20 he has been selling them for. She invites him to a party thrown by the magazine she is interning for and Blue is indeed able to mark up his prices to the mostly white crowd. Emboldened by his success, Blue visits his supplier Lloyd and asks him to give him a kilo of cocaine. Lloyd agrees and Blue and Leah go to a restaurant for breakfast. While there, he is approached by one of his regulars and goes outside to sell to him. He is immediately arrested by an undercover police officer as it turns out he has been set up. Leah picks up the kilo and quietly leaves with it. Leah goes to visit Blue in jail where he tells her that due to his priors he will be getting 20 years in jail. Leah decides to help him, telling him that she has the cocaine, so the police have no evidence. He tells her to return the kilo to Lloyd and explain the situation. Instead, she finds a good-natured lawyer named George, intending to deal the cocaine to pay his fee. He is optimistic that they have a very good case. Approaching her boss, Kelly, Leah manages to sell a third of the kilo. She also enlists Katie and Blue's friends to help move the rest of the coke, while at the same time telling Blue that George is representing him pro bono. As her debts to George pile up and Lloyd finds her and threatens her to make her come up with the rest of the money, she approaches Kelly for a $17,000 loan to cover all the costs. He instead helps her throw a rave with a cover charge in order to get it all. The party is a success, but Leah takes too many drugs and wakes up alone with all the money gone. Leah promises George that she will get him the rest of the money, but he tells her to forget about it. He takes her to dinner where he explains that the legal system is unequal and white men who commit violent crimes are more likely to get off for their crimes than non-violent offenders like Blue. The two end up going to Leah's place where Leah soon passes out, intoxicated. George's true character is revealed as he uses the opportunity to rape her. After the rape, Leah becomes silent and withdrawn, taking to her bed. She is surprised one day by Blue who arrives in her apartment and crawls into bed with her. He reveals that the lawyer managed to free him and credits Leah with saving his life. Getting on one knee he proposes to her, to which she does not give a clear answer. (However, the next scene they are happily kissing each other.) Walking down the street together, Leah and Blue are surprised when Lloyd attacks them both, wanting his money. Blue first hits him over the head with a broken bottle then beats him to death with a wrench. As Leah looks on, Blue silently realizes that she provoked the attack by not returning the cocaine. Blue is arrested, watching Leah coldly as he is driven away. Leah is last seen in a classroom, just before the credits.

This boat was renamed Metlako in 1902, and operated under that name until 1924 on the Columbia River and its tributaries, the Cowlitz, Lewis and Lake rivers. In 1924, Metlako was renamed B. H. Smith Jr., operating under that name until 1931, when the steamer was abandoned. As Bonita, in September 1900, this vessel was the first steamer to pass through the Yamhill locks. Design, construction and dimensions Bonita was built specifically to run from Portland to McMinnville, Oregon. According to one source, Bonita was built for Captain Hosford by the Johnston boatyard on the east side of Portland, Oregon. According to another (non-contemporaneous) source, Bonita was built by Robert Green for Bucham & Burns Construction. Reportedly Bonita was built for the run from Portland to Lacamas Lake near Camas, Washington, but the boat's owner, Captain Hosford, was considering placing the vessel on the route to Dayton, Oregon, along the Willamette and Yamhill rivers. Bonita was measured over the hull. Measurements over the hull excluded the length of hull extensions, such as the projection of the main deck over the stern, called the \\"fantail\\", to mount the sternwheel. The Bonita had a beam (width) of , again measured over the hull and exclusive of projections along the top of the hull, called the guards. The vessel's depth of hold was . A vessel's overall size was measured in tons, which was a unit of volume and not of weight. Bonita was 198 gross tons and 122 net tons. Each steamer in commercial service at that time had an official steamboat registry number. For Bonita, the official merchant vessel registry number was 3830. Bonita was expected to carry 200 passengers and 125 tons of freight. Power to the stern-wheel was furnished by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, single cylinder, cylinder bore and stroke of . These engines generated 5 nominal horse power.  Operations as Bonita Advertisement for excursion on Bonita to Oregon City. Bonita was launched on the morning of March 28, 1900. Hosford took Bonita on a trial run on Saturday, April 14, 1900, and the vessel ran well. Full completion of the vessel was expected by the evening of April 17, 1900. On Sunday, April 22, 1900, an excursion on Bonita was advertised, to run from Portland to Oregon City, to see Captain Edward Morey, billed as the \\"champion high diver of America\\" dive 80 feet off the Oregon City suspension bridge. Round trip fare was 40 cents. The next Sunday, April 29, 1900, Bonita ran an excursion to Vancouver, Washington, again to see Captain Morey dive, this time from a tower 90 feet high. In 1900, Bonita ran daily from McMinnville to Portland, leaving every morning. The boat remained two hours in Portland, then returned to McMinnville. The rates charged by the steamer were lower that the rates charged by the railroad. Soon after Bonita began the McMinnville route, the railroad lowered its rates to compete and improved its service. The railroad, which also controlled the steamship dock in Portland, refused to allow Bonita to use the dock, thus increasing drayage fees for the steamer. The railroad won back the shippers, and Bonita was forced off the route. =Carriage of hop pickers= In early September 1900, Bonita carried hop pickers from Portland to hops yards in the Willamette Valley, departing daily from Portland at 1:30 pm. =Collision with Pomona= On October 22, 1900, Bonita collided with the steamer Pomona as both vessels were entering the Willamette Falls Locks. There was no loss of life or damage to cargo. Bonita sustained $200 worth of damage. The steamboat inspection service investigated the incident on November 5, 1900. As a result, the license of A.J. Spong, master of Pomona, was suspended for 10 days for carelessness and negligence in handling his vessel. =Stranded on Yamhill Bar= In July 1901 as Bonita was lining across the bar of the Yamhill river, the capstan gave way, throwing one man into the river, and striking several others, but without causing serious injury. Bonita was stuck for most of a day, until the steamer Altona happened along and pulled Bonita off the shoal. The next day, Bonita successfully transited the Yamhill bar heading upriver, but when the steamer was on the other side of the bar, the river water fell, leaving Bonita trapped behind the bar. Bonita's captain sought assistance from the local road crew, which put to work carving out with a road scraper a channel in the bar, reportedly just big enough for Bonita to pass through. Said the Morning Oregonian of this incident: \\"It is further proposed that she be renamed the Gopher and equipped with a plow or two and a few agricultural huskies as assistant engineers. With a bucket of water and a road-scraper the Bonita could go overland to Kansas or anywhere.\\" =Transport of hop pickers= Bonita carried hop pickers in the 1901 picking season, departing from the foot of Washington street at 7:00 am daily for the hop fields. Operations as Metlako Metlako, at the Cowlitz River levee, circa 1923 On Saturday, March 15, 1902, the White Collar Line (also known as the Regulator Line) acquired Bonita for the run from Portland to The Dalles, Oregon. On this run, Bonita was to alternate with the White Collar line's steamer Tahoma. On April 10, 1902, the new owners changed the name of the vessel to Metlako, a name derived from a Native American legend. Reportedly when Bonita was renamed, the vessel \\"received improvements which made her practically a new boat.\\" =Placed on Columbia River route= In late April 1902, Metlako ran from Portland to The Dalles, Oregon every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, departing from the Regulator Line's dock at the foot of Alder Street at 7:00 a.m. Metlako departed The Dalles on the return trip to Portland every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at 7:00 a.m. On the morning of May 3, 1902, en route to The Dalles, about five miles upriver from Vancouver, a cylinder head blew out on Metlako, seriously (or slightly injuring a passenger. =Sold to Seattle, Portland & Spokane Railway= The Regulator Line sold Metlako to the Seattle, Portland & Seattle Railway. At about noon on January 27, 1903, Peter Gearin, a crewman on Metlako, either leaped or fell off the boat into the Columbia River and was drowned. The incident occurred at Reed's Island in the Columbia River, as Metlako was steaming upstream from Vancouver, where Gearin had boarded the vessel. Gearin was seen to dive off the companionway into the river, but whether it was suicide or an accidental loss of footing, could not be determined. The boat stopped to look for him, but no trace could be located, so Metlako continued on its way. Gearin, age 38, had been working on steamboats for about 15 years. Captain Johnnie Brown had been master of Metlako for several years. In October 1910, Capt. Charles Jordan took over as captain of Metlako from Capt. G.F. Gildez. In May 1908, Metlako was engaged as a tender for the construction of the Columbia River Railroad Bridge, and had been so since the start of bridge construction. =Cowlitz, Lewis, and Lake river service= Once construction of the railroad bridge was complete, Metlako was tied up at Vancouver until December, 1908, when the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway sold the vessel to Albert Burcham, of Kelso, Washington. Burcham intend to use Metlako on the Cowlitz and Columbia rivers in the logging business. =Reconstruction= Metlako was rebuilt in 1909 at Kelso, Washington, by Robert Green for Burcham & Burns Construction. In 1907, prior to reconstruction, Metlako was 198 gross and 122 registered tons, the same as Bonita when constructed. The total crew required for Metlako was 13, as shown on the 1907 merchant vessel register. After reconstruction, in 1909, Metlako measured out at 91 gross and 87 registered tons. The total required crew was reduced from 13 to 6. The length and beam of the vessel remained the same, indicating that the reduction in size was attributable to removal of a large part of the cabin structure. =Operations following reconstruction= In February 1915, as Metlako was being overhauled in Portland, there was talk on the waterfront that it would be placed on the Portland-Lewis River route. In early July 1916, high water on the Columbia river backed up the Lake River to Ridgefield, Washington, which was served by the steamers Metlako and Mimare. In 1919, A.E. Hayes, of Kelso, Washington, rebuilt Metlako and ran it for a short time on the Portland-Kelso route. =Legal claims= In March 1920, Metlako was tied up at a dock in Kelso, Washington, because of legal claims pending against the vessel in federal court in Tacoma, Washington. The claims arose from an action filed by the Union Oil Company, alleging that they were owed $1,070.65 for fuel supplied to Metlako. On April 26, 1920, Metlako was sold by the U.S. Marshal for $5,200 to Captain Caples, of Woodland, Washington and associates. Another source states that Walker & Co. bought the vessel at the marshal's sale. In February 1921, Walker & Co. sold Metlako to E.E. Graham & Co. =Sinking filmed= The sinking of the Metlako was filmed on motion picture camera and made into part of a newsreel which was exhibited in August, 1921. Operations as B. H. Smith Jr. In January 1923, E.E. Graham & Co. sold Metlako to Long-Bell Lumber Co. The new owners intended to use the vessel to tow barges and other craft. B. H. Smith Jr. was much smaller than Metlako, with the Smith measuring out at 97 gross and 81 registered tons. On April 25, 1924, the name of the vessel was changed to B. H. Smith Jr., after the assistant general manager of Long-Bell Lumber Co. Long-Bell Lumber Co. had its headquarters in Longview, Washington. Disposition B.H Smith Jr. was abandoned in 1931.

Officially, the two countries do not have bilateral relations, but according to Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara, they maintain covert ties. History Sudan officially went to war with Israel in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the Six-Day War in 1967 though it did not participate in the Suez Crisis. In the early 1950s, Sudan – then still not independent – had active trade relations with Israel.Gabriel R. Warburg: The Sudan and Israel – An Episode in Bilateral Relations, in: Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 28, No. 2 (April 1992), pp. 385–396. Sudan did not actively participate in the Yom Kippur War, as Sudanese forces arrived too late to participate. Israel backed Christian militias that fought the Sudanese government in the First and Second Sudanese Civil Wars. In January 2016, Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour floated normalized ties with Israel provided the U.S. government lifts economic sanctions.Sudan said willing to consider normalizing ties with Israel Times of Israel Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir followed that up by saying in an interview with Saudi newspaper Okaz, \\"Even if Israel had conquered Syria, it would not have inflicted the destruction taking place there right now, would not have killed the number of people killed so far and would not have expelled people the way they are being expelled now.\\" Israel flew medics and equipment to Sudan to try and save a diplomat infected with COVID-19.https://www.timesofisrael.com/tv-israel-sent-doctors-to-sudan-in-bid- to-save-diplomat-behind-secret-ties It was revealed in early September 2016 that Israel had contacted the U.S. government and other Western countries and encouraged them to take steps to improve relations with Sudan in wake of the break in relations between the Arab-African country and Iran in the past year, all but confirming a secret alliance between Sudan and Israel. Kara later revealed at an event in Beersheba that he was maintaining contacts with many Sudanese officials and did not deny that a Sudanese official had recently visited Israel. In February 2020, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Chairman of the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, met in Uganda, where they both agreed to normalize the ties between the two countries. Later that month, Israeli planes were allowed to fly over Sudan.

In 1877, he was appointed a Professor of drawing at his alma mater, the Kraków Academy. While there, he made copies of works by Jan Matejko that would be turned into woodcuts and helped Matejko plot the perspective on his huge paintings. He also provided illustrations for Tygodnik Ilustrowany and other periodicals. In 1886, he was elected President of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts. In 1888, he painted \\"Our Lady of the Polish Crown\\" for the altar of a church in Stryj and, together with Matejko, created portraits of Saints Kinga and Adalbert at a church in Stary Wiśnicz. Many of his students would become well-known artists; including Stanisław Wyspiański, Piotr Stachiewicz, Jan Wojnarski, Ludwik Stasiak, Artur Markowicz, Wojciech Weiss, Ludwik Misky, Józef Rapacki, Stefan Filipkiewicz, Władysław Benda and Zefiryn Ćwikliński.

The reference is to a dangerous structural fault such as a missing stair in a home, which residents have become used to and accepting of, and which is not fixed or signposted, but which (most) newcomers are warned about.  Origins  The phrase was coined by blogger Cliff Pervocracy in a 2012 post on The Pervocracy, a blog about BDSM and kink. Describing a man in his social circle known to be a rapist, Pervocracy wrote: > People had gotten so used to working around this guy, to accommodating his > \\"special requirements,\\" that they didn't feel like there was an urgent > problem in their community. They did eventually expel him, but it was after > months of it being widely shared knowledge that he was a rapist. [...] I > think there were some people in the community who were intentionally > protecting him, but there were more who were de facto protecting him by > treating him like a missing stair. Like something you're so used to working > around, you never stop to ask \\"what if we actually fixed this?\\" Eventually > you take it for granted that working around this guy is just a fact of life, > and if he hurts someone, that's the fault of whoever didn't apply the > workarounds correctly. Pervocracy intended the term to apply beyond sexually predatory behaviour to include, for example, underperforming colleagues who let others pick up their slack. While it has most often been used in the context of sexual misconduct, it may describe a variety of uncomfortable social circumstances.  Meaning  The analogy of the missing stair has been described as powerful because it makes it clear that the problem is the missing stair (the predator) and the solution is fixing the stair (stopping the predatory behaviour). An article about industry sexual harassment on comics news site ComicsAlliance posed the question: \\"Which one of these statements makes more sense to say: 'These people need to find more ways to stop people from harming them.' OR: 'These people should stop causing harm.' If you ever find yourself saying the former instead of the latter, take a moment and ask yourself why.\\" In a 2014 post on the anti-rape blog Yes Means Yes, lawyer Thomas MacAulay Millar wrote that the missing stair analogy was consistent with his understanding of rapists' motivations and behaviours, based on research carried out by clinical psychologists David Lisak and Paul M. Miller, and by Stephanie K. McWhorter, a researcher with the U.S. Naval Health Research Center. Millar wrote that while a small number of rapists are \\"one-timers\\" who may be making a mistake or confused about consent, the majority are repeat offenders, averaging six rapes each. \\"We need to spot the rapists,\\" Millar wrote, \\"and we need to shut down the social structures that give them a license to operate. They don’t accidentally end up in a room with a woman too drunk or high to consent or resist; they plan on getting there and that’s where they end up.\\"  Usage  The analogy has been picked up and used in communities related to paganism, comics, punk, and geek culture, and in Tavi Gevinson's Rookie, a magazine for teenage girls. It has been used by advice columnists including Captain Awkward, and Sam W. at Scarleteen. Geek culture site The Mary Sue referenced the concept in 2013, in a story celebrating science fiction writer John Scalzi's announcement that he would no longer attend science fiction conventions that didn't have clear and prominent Sexual harassment policies. In 2014 Feministe quoted science fiction editor Michi Trota describing James Frenkel, who was permanently banned from attending Wiscon after harassment complaints, as \\"someone who has been an industry missing stair for decades.\\" In 2014 the anti-rape blog Yes Means Yes compared disgraced former broadcaster and pop musician Jian Ghomeshi to a missing stair, and urged the BDSM community to distance themselves from him. In 2015, the missing stair concept was invoked by The Guardian in its coverage of American astronomer Geoffrey Marcy's resignation from his professorship at UC Berkeley, following its finding that between 2001 and 2010 he had repeatedly violated the university's sexual harassment policy. In 2015, after pornographic film actress Stoya accused her colleague and former boyfriend James Deen of rape, prompting similar allegations by a dozen other women, feminist site We Hunted the Mammoth wrote that James Deen seemed to be \\"a perfect example\\" of a missing stair. The concept has also been discussed in reference to religion in the workplace, such as a coworker who repeatedly skirts the line of evangelizing to their colleagues, and who everyone in the workplace simply works around. In a post on the blog Ask A Manager, which discusses employment issues, a reader wrote in to ask about how to handle a colleague who repeatedly asked personal questions about their faith or lack thereof, but who received no disciplinary action or reproachment. Rather, the reader described the colleague in question as the \\"company’s personal Michael Scott and everyone kind of worked around him as a missing stair.\\" On NPR, in a review of the 2015 Jo Walton science fiction/fantasy novel The Just City, reviewer Amal El-Mohtar argued that Walton deliberately included missing stairs in her book, in an effort to reflect current discourse around the topic. In 2017, adult performer Jessica Drake gave an interview to Rolling Stone, regarding the sexual allegations surrounding colleague Ron Jeremy that were then just starting to come to light, said of Jeremy: “I have viewed [Ron Jeremy] as the missing stair in the adult community.\\" See also * Bus factor  References  Category:Concepts in social philosophy Category:Deviance (sociology) Category:Sexual abuse Category:Social agreement Category:Social phenomena ","title":"Missing stair"},{"id":"49183942","text":"Talk That Talk is the ninth album by The Jazz Crusaders recorded in 1965 and released on the Pacific Jazz label.Pacific Jazz Records Catalog: 10100/20100 series accessed January 12, 2016Stix Hooper Discography accessed January 12, 2016 Reception AllMusic rated the album with 4½ stars; in their review, Scott Yanow said: \\"The solos (particularly by tenor saxophonist Wilton Felder and trombonist Wayne Henderson) are fine but the material (a few group originals plus pop tunes such as \\"Walk on By\\" and \\"Hey Girl\\") is uniformly lightweight and rather forgettable\\".

Flights on the route are scheduled for one and a half minutes, and actual flying time is closer to one minute. The record for the fastest flight is 47 seconds. The route is flown by Loganair, a Scottish regional airline that serves Scotland's Highlands and islands. Background The route between the Orkney Islands of Westray and Papa Westray in northern Scotland is a subsidised public service obligation. The Orkney Islands Council awards the route, along with several other routes throughout the islands, through a tendering process. The flights began in 1967, initially establishing the record for the world's shortest scheduled flights, and they have been continuously operated by Loganair. In 2013, the contract was again awarded to Loganair over two competing bids. Flights Loganair aircraft taxiing at Papa Westray airport Flights between Westray Airport and Papa Westray Airport occur daily in both directions, except on Saturdays, when only flights from Westray to Papa Westray are available, and on Sunday, when only flights from Papa Westray to Westray are available.

Many students and their teachers take these flights to study the 60 archaeological sites on Papa Westray, making up the majority of passengers. Occasionally health professionals are needed to assist one of the island's 90 residents, and patients will also take the flight from Papa Westray to medical facilities when needed. The flight has also become popular among tourists. =Aircraft= Loganair operates this flight with one of its two Britten-Norman BN2B-26 Islander aircraft. The Islander is a high-wing, twin piston engine, propeller- driven aircraft. It is flown by a single pilot, and there is seating for eight passengers in the passenger cabin. One additional seat usually remains empty next to the pilot. Loganair's chief executive, Jim Cameron, described the Islander as \\"robust\\" and \\"well suited to the vagaries of Scottish weather\\". Summarizing expert opinion of the Islander, Alastair Dalton of The Scotsman said the aircraft \\"had a good safety record and had proved versatile in operating from the shortest and roughest Highland runways\\". Loganair is planning to introduce electric aircraft to the Orkney Islands by 2021 due to the short distance between the islands that would make such flights possible. =Flight numbers= The flight numbers change daily and repeat with a weekly cycle. Loganair Flight 312 departs from Westray Airport to Papa Westray Airport on Monday morning, and Flight 317 returns to Westray that afternoon. On Tuesdays through Fridays, the flight numbers to Papa Westray are 323, 333, 343, and 353. The return flight numbers are 328, 338, 348, and 358.

Other avalanches the same day struck Italian and other Austrian positions, killing hundreds. According to some reports both sides deliberately fired shells into the weakened snowpacks in an attempt to bury the other side. An accurate estimation of the number of casualties from the White Friday avalanches is not available. Historical documents suggest at least 2,000 victims among the soldiers and a few dozens among civilians. The date 13 December, marked Saint Lucia, a commemorative religious holiday practiced by the majority of Italian Catholics. Though the occurrence of avalanches in the Dolomites Mountains took place on a Wednesday in 1916, the term \\"White Friday\\" was used to coin the disastrous day.  Gran Poz summit Avalanches  The Austro-Hungarian Kaiserschützen military barracks was built on the Gran Poz summit (approximately 11,000 ft above sea level) of Mount Marmolada. The wooden barracks was built in August of the summer of 1916, to house the men of the 1st Battalion of the Imperial Rifle Regiment Nr.III (1.Btl. KschRgt.III). The location of the barracks was planned to be well situated to protect it from Italian attack and provide a defense atop the contested Mount Marmolada. The barracks was placed along rock cliffs to protect it from direct enemy fire and the location was out of high-angle mortar range. During the winter of 1916, heavy snowfall and a sudden thaw in the Alps created conditions ripe for avalanches. From the beginning of December, the snow pile up was recorded at atop the summit. The Austro-Hungarian commander of the 1.Btl. KschRgt.III, Captain Rudolf Schmid, noticed the imminent danger his company faced. Out of fear his position would be soon untenable, Capt. Schmid wrote a request to his superior, Field Marshal Lieutenant Ludwig Goiginger of the 60th Infantry Division. The appeal was ultimately turned down to vacate the base atop Gran Poz summit. In the eight days before the avalanche, additional heavy snowfall disrupted telephone lines of communication and left each outpost stranded with a lack of supplies. Remains of a destroyed Austro-Hungarian weapons cache, Marmolada On , at 5:30 a.m., over 200,000 tons (approx. 1 million cubic metres) of snow and ice plunged down the mountainside directly onto the barracks. The wooden buildings packed with soldiers, collapsed under the weight of the avalanche, crushing the occupants. Of the 321 troops present, 229 were Kaiserschützen mountain infantry and 102 were Bosnians from a support column. Only a few were pulled to safety while 270 were buried alive. Only 40 of the bodies were ever recovered from the pileup. Among those who survived was Captain Schmid along with his aide, who escaped slightly injured.  Val Ciampi d'Arei Avalanches  On the night of 13 December, an avalanche struck an Italian division of the 7th Alpini, overrunning their mountain barracks. The Italians called the disastrous day La Santa Lucia Nera after Saint Lucy's Day.  Aftermath  In the aftermath of White Friday, 10,000 soldiers on all sides were killed in December from avalanches. Altogether, it constituted the greatest number of deaths caused by snow/ice debris from avalanches in history. When including all avalanche-related deaths (this includes mud and rock slides triggered subsequently by an avalanche), White Friday is the second-worst avalanche-related disaster recorded, after the 1970 Huascarán avalanche.

The scene depicts one of the most important moments of the war. After Achilles had withdrawn from battle, his best friend Patroklos, wearing Achilles' armour, took his place. Before being killed by Hector, Patroklos was wounded by Euphorbos. Euphorbos was then killed by Menelaos during the fight for the body of Patroklos. In the scene depicted, from Iliad book 17, Hector joins the fight for the body of Patroclus just after Menelaus has killed Euphorbos and prevents Menaelaos from stripping the armour from the dead body.

It is the earliest known version of the pantocrator style that still survives today, and is regarded by historians and scholars to be one of the most important and recognizable works in the study of Byzantine art as well as Eastern Orthodox Christianity.Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92.  Background  For a time the icon was thought to have been dated from the thirteenth century, since it had been almost completely painted over at that time, but it was concluded in 1962 that it is in fact from the mid-sixth century, although the exact date of production is still unknown.Kurt Weitzmann, The Monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai, the Icons (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1976), 13. When Saint Catherine’s Monastery was founded by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, late in his reign, between 548 and 565,Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 13. it enjoyed imperial patronage and donations from Justinian and his court, with the Christ Pantocrator icon having been one of the many possible imperial gifts.Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92; Kōnstantinos A. Manaphēs, Sinai: Treasures of the Monastery of Saint Catherine (Athens: Ekdotike Athenon, 1990), 93. Because of this, it is generally believed to have been produced in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople.Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92.  Interpretation and meaning  Mirrored composites of left and right sides of image Many agree that the icon represents the dual nature of Christ, illustrating traits of both man and God,Manolis Chatzidakis and Gerry Walters, “An Encaustic Icon of Christ at Sinai,” The Art Bulletin 49, No. 3 (1967): 201; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92; Manaphēs 93; Weitzmann, Sinai, the Icons, 15. perhaps influenced by the aftermath of the ecumenical councils of the previous century at Ephesus and Chalcedon.Manaphēs, Sinai: Treasures, 84; Robin Cormack, Oxford History of Art: Byzantine Art (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 66. Christ’s features on his left side (the viewer's right) are supposed to represent the qualities of his human nature, while his right side (the viewer's left) represents his divinity.Weitzmann, Sinai, the Icons, 15. His right hand is shown opening outward, signifying his gift of blessing, while the left hand and arm is clutching a thick Gospel book.Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 201. Some scholars have suggested the icon at Sinai could have been a possible representation of the Kamouliana icon of ChristCormack, Byzantine Art, 78-9; Manaphēs, Sinai: Treasures, 93. or of the famous icon of Christ of the Chalke Gate,Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 202. an image which was destroyed twice during the first and second waves of Byzantine Iconoclasmfirst in 726, and again in 814and thus its connection with the Christ Pantocrator is difficult to confirm.Weitzmann, Sinai, the Icons, 14.  Description and production  With a height of 84 cm, width of 45.5 cm, and a thickness of 1.2 cm, the icon was originally taller and wider before its top and sides were cut.Weitzmann, Sinai, the Icons, 13. Otherwise there is only one spot with major damage, a large portion of Christ’s hair on his left side, including his left ear and shoulder.Weitzmann, Sinai, the Icons, 13. The original encaustic surface has continually been preserved in excellent condition overall.Weitzmann, Sinai, the Icons, 13. As with many of the early icons from Sinai, the Christ Pantocrator was created by using this technique, known as encaustic—a medium using hot wax paint—that would rarely continue to be utilized in the Byzantine world after the iconoclastic controversies of the eighth and ninth centuries.Cormack, Byzantine Art, 111-2. In fact, the monastery at Sinai is the only place in the world where a substantial number of these encaustic icons, particularly those dating from as early as the sixth century, have been preserved.Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 91. During the Period of Byzantine Iconoclasm, the production of Orthodox icons continued at Sinai, whereas they were being destroyed in Constantinople.Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92-3.  Survival from Byzantine Iconoclasm and aftermath  The Muslim Arabs quickly took control of the entire Fertile Crescent south of the Turkish mountains, including Egypt and Sinai, cutting the monastery’s ties with Constantinople in the year 640.Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92. Therefore, by the time the era of iconoclasm had been initiated by Emperor Leo III in 726, the Monastery of Saint Catherine had already been protected under Muslim rule for nearly a century and was able to survive the destruction of iconoclasm.Kurt Weitzmann, “The Mosaic in St. Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai,” Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 110, No. 6 (Dec. 1966): 405; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92; Manaphēs, Sinai: Treasures, 92. Furthermore, the location of the monastery in the rocky desert of Sinai, far away from any major trade or military route, kept the contents within St. Catherine’s safe from raiders as well as conquering armies.Weitzmann, “Mosaic in St. Catherine’s,” 392; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 49. Even today the monastery houses more than 2,000 icons, dating from the sixth century to modern times.Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 99.

The line runs from Jamesburg, New Jersey to the current end of track at Cranbury, New Jersey. The line was built by the Camden & Amboy Railroad (C&A;) one of the first railroads in the country. It has been operated by C&A;, the Pennsylvania Railroad, Penn Central, and finally, Conrail. History=Beginnings (1832–1871)= 1869 Map of the Camden & Amboy Railway and associated lines. The line highlighted in red includes the original route which ended at Bordentown. The line's history starts on December 17, 1832 with the opening of the Camden and Amboy Railroad between South Amboy and Bordentown. The railroad, which followed the same route as the Hightstown Industrial Track today, was built to convey passengers between New York and Philadelphia. However, passengers had to transfer to either stagecoaches or ferries at the ends of the line to reach the cities themselves. On September 9, 1833, the line's steam locomotive, the John Bull, entered service, starting its run in South Amboy. On the return Journey, it derailed in Hightstown when it hit a hog. Also that fall, the line between Bordentown and Delanco was completed, bringing the southern terminus closer to Philadelphia. Finally, on December 29, 1834, the line was completed to Camden. From then until 1839, operations continued unchanged, but on the first day of 1839, the company completed a line between New Brunswick and Trenton, which connected with the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company in New Brunswick. This allowed trains to go straight to Jersey City, greatly lessening the importance of the line through Hightstown and Cranbury. From then on, operations remained unchanged, save for the creation of the junction in Jamesburg with the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad (now the Freehold Secondary). Corporately, the Camden and Amboy and the New Jersey Railroad were officially merged on February 1, 1867. On December 1, 1871, the Pennsylvania Railroad leased the properties of the two railroads (by then amalgamated into the United Canal & Railroad Companies of New Jersey), and split its properties into two divisions; the Amboy, which contained the original Camden and Amboy main line and the New York, which included the main line of the NJRR. =PRR/PC Ownership (1871–1976)= Under the Pennsylvania, the line was relegated to secondary status, owing to the parallel Northeast Corridor. However, north of Jamesburg, the line was electrified, so coal trains could run from Harrisburg straight through to the coal dumpers at South Amboy with electric power. South of Jamesburg, the line was never electrified. In the early 1960s, the line was severed between Hightstown and Windsor, to save money on taxes and to save on maintenance costs. For the first time since 1832, the Camden and Amboy main line was not a through route. The northern part of the line is now the Hightstown Industrial Track. By that time, the northeastern railroad industry was in crisis, with trucks taking their toll on traffic, and the railroads saddled with unprofitable operations. And in 1968, the Pennsylvania merged with the New York Central, forming the Penn Central. In 1976, after eight disastrous years of operation, Conrail absorbed the PC, along with half a dozen other ailing northeastern railroads. =Conrail (1976–present)= Conrail, which has operated the Hightstown Industrial Track since the death of Penn Central, has made relatively few changes to the line. Indeed, all they have done is abandoned it south of Cranbury in 1983, when traffic south of that point dried up. In 1999, during the split of Conrail between CSX and Norfolk Southern, the line was conveyed to Conrail Shared Assets Operations, who operates it to this day. The line is served by Conrail Local Freight WPSA-31 (Wayfreight Philadelphia division SAyreville - 31) on Mondays and Wednesdays.

Shepherd, son of Daniel and Anna (Forrest) Shepherd, was born in Boscawen, N. H., October 31, 1800. He entered Dartmouth College in 1823, but spent the Senior year at Yale College. He was admitted to the bachelor's degree at both Colleges in 1827. He remained in New Haven as a graduate student for two or three years, and on April 29, 1832, married Sophia W. Storer, of Rutland, Vt. In 1841 and 1842 he took a partial course in the Yale Divinity School. His active life was spent in teaching and in the study of the natural sciences, and while his home remained in New Haven he was absent during a large portion of the time on geological and geographical explorations. In 1846 he visited the southern shore of Lake Superior, where he surveyed and located several of the copper and iron mines which have since become important; and in 1847 he surveyed the mineral lands between Lake Superior and Hudson's Bay. In 1848 he traveled extensively in Great Britain, in 1849 in Cuba and Central America, and in 1850 and 1851 he explored nearly the whole of California. In 1856 and 1857 he explored the island of Newfoundland, and in 1859 and 1860 New Brunswick and the islands in the Bay of Fundy. In 1865 he visited Northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the union. From 1847 to 1856 he held the Professorship of Economic Geology and Agricultural Chemistry in Western Reserve College, at Hudson, Ohio, delivering an annual course of lectures in fulfillment of the duties of his chair. During the American Civil War, Shepherd wrote to President Abraham Lincoln suggesting that hydrogen chloride be employed to incapacitate Confederate troops or force them to retreat, but his idea was not adopted. His wife died before him, and his later years were spent with his children. He died in Norwich, Connecticut, December 7, 1888, in his 89th year, while visiting his eldest daughter, the widow of the Rev. William Hutchison. He left also a daughter, the wife of the Rev. Charles T. Weitzel, and a son. Shepherd is the namesake of Shepherd Mountain in Missouri.

Activism  Simpson is active in First Nations social issues, including reform of Canada's Indian Act, gender-based violence and the protection of indigenous homelands. She was an active participant in the Idle No More protest movement. Her philosophy is described as an opposition to what she describes as \\"extractivism.\\" This term encompasses the extraction of natural resources from the Earth, the colonial \\"extraction\\" (\\"assimilation\\") of Indigenous peoples, and the \\"cognitive extraction\\" of Indigenous ideas, i.e., cultural appropriation. She works in the field of Indigenous resurgence and suggests an alternative ideology focused on rebuilding Indigenous nationhood using Indigenous intelligence and local engagement with land and community.  Writing  Simpson was inspired to write while collecting stories told by Nishnaabeg elders for her first collection, Dancing on Our Turtle's Back. In 2013, Simpson published The Gift is in the Making, which reimagined traditional stories from the Nishnaabeg. She published Islands of Decolonial Love the same year, a collection of short stories. She has worked as an editor for several collections, including: Lighting the Eighth Fire, This is an Honour Song, and The Winter We Danced: Voices from the Past, the Future, and the Idle No More Movement.

Those letters, which reveal an adventurous, capable, and resourceful woman of lively intelligence, were published in two collections in 1914 and 1915. The first of those collections, Letters of a Woman Homesteader, was the basis of the 1979 movie Heartland.  Biography  Elinore Pruitt was born on June 3, 1876 in White Bead Hill, then a settlement in Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, and is an abandoned township in Garvin County, Oklahoma (founded 1906). Her father died in the late 1870s on Army service near the Mexican border. Shortly afterwards, her mother, Josephine Courtney Pruitt, married her husband's brother, Thomas Isaac Pruitt, and bore eight more children. Elinore was educated for a few years at Pierce Institute near White Bead Hill until that grammar school closed in 1889. In 1893, her mother died of complications from childbirth, and in 1894, her stepfather died in a work accident, leaving the orphaned Elinore responsible for her younger siblings, with only her grandparents available for support. Around 1902, she married Harry Cramer Rupert, then 48 years old. He died in a railroad accident before their daughter Mary Jerrine was born (February 10, 1906, reportedly in Oklahoma City). She then relocated to Denver, Colorado, where she worked as a laundress, and then in permanent employment as housekeeper for Mrs. Juliet Coney, a widowed schoolteacher from Boston, Massachusetts. In early 1909, Henry Clyde Stewart (18681948), a widower, placed an advertisement in The Denver Post for a housekeeper to help on his homestead near Burntfork, Wyoming. Elinore answered it (with the agreement of Mrs. Coney), and was accepted. She arrived there in March 1909; in early May, she filed a claim for a quarter section adjoining Clyde's homestead under one of the Homestead Acts; and on May 5, she and Clyde were married. Around this time, she began to correspond with Mrs. Coney, in a series of letters which continued until 1914. Those letters were published in Atlantic Monthly and later collected in the books Letters of a Woman Homesteader (1914) and Letters on an Elk Hunt (1915). She concealed the fact of her marriage for several years during her correspondence because, according to her, she wanted to be independent and to claim the land as her own. In 1912, she relinquished her claim in favor of her mother-in-law; rather than risk losing it for breach of the Homestead Acts' provisions for claims by single women. By the early 1920s, she had gained national fame as the \\"Woman Homesteader.\\" Ever practical, she used the royalties from her writings to buy supplies and equipment for the homestead. in 1928, she was included in Grace Raymond Hebard's Map of the History and Romance of Wyoming, a literary map of the state. Elinore and Clyde had five children: Helen (stillborn, 1910); James Wilber, (FebruaryDecember 1910, died of erysipelas); Henry Clyde, Jr. (born 1911); Calvin Emery (1912-1971); and Robert Clinton (born 1913). Jerrine, Elinore's daughter by her first marriage, died in 1987. Elinore died on October 8, 1933 of a blood clot to the brain following gallbladder surgery, at the hospital in Rock Springs, Wyoming. She is buried in Burntfork Cemetery, Sweetwater County, Wyoming. Her husband Clyde is buried by her. According to another, but unsourced, account, Elinore was born at Fort Smith, Arkansas; spent most of her childhood in Indian Territory; her schooling ended when her teacher was lynched; her parents died when she was 14 years old; after her first husband's death and the birth of Jerrine, she trained as a nurse and worked at a hospital in Burnfork, and in her spare time wrote articles for the Kansas City Star; found work in Denver as a cook; in 1926, suffered serious injuries, from which she never completely recovered, when a horse bolted and she was run over by a hay mower. Letters of a Woman Homesteader covers the years 1909 to 1914. Letters on an Elk Hunt covers two incident-packed months, August–October 1914, on a licensed elk hunt, for both the adventure and the meat. Her letters have been described as \\"frank, vivid, eloquent and perceptive\\". Her biographer Susanne K. George has remarked that \\"Although largely autobiographical, these works were written for publication, and she was known to have 'never let the facts get in the way of a good story'\\".  Legacy  The 1979 movie Heartland, directed by Richard Pearce and starring Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell, was based on Letters of a Woman Homesteader. In 1985, the Elinore Pruitt Stewart Homestead, where she and her family lived, was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

This story inserts ancient Chinese mythology into modern life in San Francisco. The story follows the boy Tom as he becomes the magical apprentice of the tiger Mr. Hu. Together with a band of mythological misfits, their job is to protect the ancient phoenix from Vatten and the Clan of Nine who wish to use its powers for evil. The story explores themes of kindness, loyalty, duty, and bravery. Plot summary Tom, a young Chinese American boy has grown up under the care of his eccentric grandmother, Mrs. Lee, in San Francisco. He is her reluctant apprentice Guardian, learning ancient Chinese magic to protect a coral rose. However, upon the arrival of Mr. Hu, a tiger and Mrs. Lee's former apprentice, monsters attack. Mrs. Lee dies protecting Tom and the rose, leaving Mr. Hu the guardian of both Tom and the coral rose. (pg. 25-26). Safe in Mr. Hu's antique shop in Chinatown, Mr. Hu reveals that the coral rose is actually the phoenix which has the power to transform evil beings into good ones. In ancient Chinese mythology, the creature Kung Kung attempts to use the phoenix to force human beings to obey him. After the Empress Nü Kua defeated Kung Kung, the phoenix chose to return to his egg and await a time of peace when his power would not be misused and the role of the Guardian is created to protect the phoenix. (pg. 39-40) However, Kung Kung's lieutenant Vatten and the Clan of Nine (named for Vattens form as a nine-headed-serpent) have followed the Chinese Guardians to America and the phoenix will require both Mr. Hu and Tom to protect it. Tom, however, is afraid to truly take on the role of an apprentice Guardian. (pg. 28). Mr. Hu guides Tom to Goblin Square, a hidden market for the magical inhabitants of San Francisco's Chinatown. Here they meet Mistral, an old friend of Mr. Hu. Mistral is a Chinese Dragon, an exile from her ocean home for speaking out against the Dragon King(pg. 89-90). Mistral agrees to leave her job as a bodyguard in order to help Mr. Hu protect the phoenix. The day after they visit Goblin Square another old friend arrives. Sidney, a zealous salesperson in the form of a flying rat, has seen one of Vatten's spies (pg. 30-32, 68). Mr. Hu leaves Tom to wait for Mistral and protect the phoenix. While Mr. Hu is gone, a silver haired girl, Räv, comes to the door in a fright, looking for sanctuary. Although Mr. Hu has commanded Tom not to open the door, Tom is moved by compassion and lets her in. With the door open, the creature Loo arrives. Another creature from ancient Chinese mythology, Loo is a three-eyed fanged creature with blue skin and red hair. He carries an umbrella that shoots fumes of fatal diseases (pg. 75-83). Tom is knocked unconscious and Räv and the phoenix disappear. When Tom wakes he finds another of Mr. Hu's old friends, Monkey. Monkey, who was cursed for challenging Heaven and who stole his magic staff from the Dragon Kingdom, has also come at Mr. Hu's call to protect the phoenix (pg. 79, 122). Mr. Hu arrives to find Tom, Mistral, and Monkey amidst the shambles of his shop. Sidney is locked up for a spy and the four leave, Mr. Hu, Monkey and Mistral in their human forms, to find the phoenix. The spy's trail leads them to a run-down house near the ocean where Tom finds Räv tied up and injured. As they try to rescue Räv, the floor turns into a pack of red scaled, blue bristled dogs, Hsieh, which overwhelm the would-be-rescuers (99-100). Loo arrives and reveals that Räv tricked them. Loo traps them in the shrinking room as it fills with water, leaving Räv and the Hsieh to die with them. Though the tiger's and dragon's strength cannot break the walls, Tom reminds Mr. Hu his grandmother's final lesson, \\"use your wits, not your claws\\" (pg. 107). Mr. Hu shrinks everyone trapped and Monkey transforms the hairs of his tail into smaller monkeys which guide everyone out through the source of the water. Räv and the Hsieh are rescued and trapped in a pebble, but not before she reveals that Vatten plans to force the phoenix to hatch early. Sidney, who has escaped his prison, has found that Vatten has been hiding the phoenix under a hill in the middle of Stow Lake. Though Mr. Hu, Mistral, and Monkey realize that they are too old and will likely not return, they go with Sidney and Tom to find the phoenix. Held up by Loo, Monkey stays behind to fight him while the others proceed to navigate the traps set for them. Mistral is forced to hold back the fanged and clawed tiger-eating unicorn called a Po(pg. 139). Tom, now determined to live up to his grandmother's legacy deliberately springs a trap so Mr. Hu can retrieve the phoenix. Tom is caught in the hair of the venomous, many-headed creature called The Watcher (pg. 140). Even as a ferocious tiger, Mr. Hu cannot stop them. In a last ditch attempt Mr. Hu and Sidney free Tom by setting the Watcher on fire, but they are too late. Mr. Hu refuses to give up Tom to death, instead bringing everyone to the magical realm of the Empress. The Empress gives some of Mr. Hu's tiger soul to Tom to save him. She also presses a golden scale to Tom's cheek, promising she will come if he calls (pg. 171). The group returns to the mortal realm with the phoenix, exhausted but successful. Characters * Tom Lee: A young Chinese American and apprentice Guardian. * Mrs. Lee: Guardian and Tom's grandmother. * Mr. Hu: A Tiger and Guardian * Mistral: Exiled dragon. * Monkey: Immortal monkey who challenged Heaven and uses a magical staff. * Räv: Young girl who works for Loo and is betrayed. * Vatten: Enemy leader who wants the phoenix. * Empress Nü Kua: Ancient Chinese goddess. Themes * Kindness: Yep places a great deal of emphasis on the importance of kindness. Tom regularly puts himself in danger to rescue others, even when they have wronged him or he is afraid. He does this in imitation of his grandmother who was known for taking in the strays who became her apprentices and friends. * Loyalty: Mr. Hu and Tom accept their duties out of loyalty to Mrs. Lee but continue out of loyalty to each other. Mistral and Monkey are enemies but unite with Mr. Hu because of loyalties. Sidney stays with Mr. Hu even after being accused of being a traitor. All of the characters fight for the phoenix out of loyalty to the Empress and her followers. * Duty: Although Tom is frightened by the world of magic and monsters, he feels it is his duty to retrieve what has been lost. Similarly, Mr. Hu does not wish to carry responsibilities, but upon accepting the duties of the Guardian he takes care of both Tom and the phoenix. * Bravery: Many of the characters are untrained or too old to fight, yet they continue to fight. Each of the characters volunteers to risk their lives in order to protect each other and the phoenix. * Good vs. Evil: the two sides are clearly marked in the struggle for the phoenix. Vatten and the Clan of Nine are evil, taking power and control through violence. In contrast, the guardians of the phoenix fight to protect the innocent and show mercy on their enemies. Series The book was followed by two books of the trilogy, Tiger's Blood and Tiger Magic. Film adaptation In October 2008, Cartoon Network announced the live-action animated film adaptation of the book with a script by David Magee with Rainmaker Entertainment contracted for the animation. The project was cancelled after Cartoon Network stopped developing live-action projects. In March 2019, Paramount Pictures announced an animated film adaptation to be released on February 11, 2022, with Carlos Baena's directorial debut with Magee and Harry Cripps writing the script. It was delayed until February 10, 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, Paramount Animation announced that the animation will be proved by Mikros Image Europe, making it the second collab since Sherlock Gnomes.

The storm was so devastating that it caused more English casualties than any of the previous battles of the war.  Siege of Chartres  On 5 April 1360, Edward III, King of England led his army of 10,000 men (including approximately 4,000 men-at-arms, 700 continental mercenaries, 5,000 mounted archers) to the gates of Paris, in one of the largest English armies fielded in the Hundred Years' War. The force was headed by the King's most trusted lieutenants, including the Prince of Wales; Henry, duke of Lancaster; the earls of Northampton and Warwick; and Sir Walter Mauny; all men who had been responsible for many of the English military successes in the preceding two decades. The defenders of Paris led by the Charles, Dauphine of France, refused battle. It was not possible to breach the defenses so over the next week Edward would try to induce the Dauphine into open battle. All attempts at the latter would prove futile and undermine Edward's hope for a decisive outcome. The English left the vicinity of Paris after laying waste to the countryside, and marched towards the French cathedral city of Chartres. On Easter Monday 13 April Edward's army arrived at the gates of Chartres. The French defenders again refused battle, instead sheltering behind their fortifications, and a siege ensued. The French defense was low in numbers and led by the Abbot of Cluny, Androuin de La Roche. That night, the English army made camp outside Chartres in an open plain. A sudden storm materialized and lightning struck, killing several people. The temperature fell dramatically and huge hailstones along with freezing rain, began pelting the soldiers, scattering the horses. Two of the English leaders were killed, and panic set in among the troops, who had little to no shelter from the storm. One described it as \\"a foul day, full of myst and hayle, so that men dyed on horseback [sic].” Tents were torn apart by the fierce wind and baggage trains were strewn around. In a half-hour, the incitement and intense cold killed nearly 1,000 Englishmen and up to 6,000 horses. Among the injured English leaders was Sir Guy de Beauchamp II, the eldest son of Thomas de Beauchamp, the 11th Earl of Warwick; he would die of his injuries two weeks after. Edward was convinced the phenomenon was a sign from God against his endeavors. During the climax of the storm he is said to have dismounted from his horse and kneeled in the direction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres. He recited a vow of peace and was convinced to negotiate with the French. Shortly after the freak storm, the next day, Androuin de La Roche arrived at the English camp with peace proposals. Edward agreed with the counsel of his trusted aid Henry of Grosmont, the 1st Duke of Lancaster. That day Edward began the withdrawal of his army from the gates of Chartres, effectively ending the one- day siege of the town.  Aftermath  French friar Jean de Venette credited the apocalyptic storm as the result of the English looting of the French countryside during the observant week of Lent. On 8 May 1360, three weeks later, the Treaty of Brétigny was signed, marking the end of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War. The legacy was mentioned in Shakespeare:  See also  * 1490 Ch'ing-yang event References Category:Battles of the Hundred Years' War Category:1360 in England Category:1360s in France Category:Chartres Category:Ice storms Category:Monday Category:Conflicts in 1360 ","title":"Black Monday (1360)"},{"id":"49184657","text":"Shen Qibin (; born 1966 in Yixing, Jiangsu, China) is a Chinese artist and art disseminator.

Arriving at the peak of a growing anti-base movement, \\"Bloody Sunagawa\\" is remembered as the most intense and violent protest against U.S. military bases in Japan. Origins An old woman sitting on her land behind barbed wire, with a sign reading \\"Off Limits\\", September 1955 On May 4, 1955, an official from the Tachikawa branch of the approached the mayor of Sunagawa to inform him of plans to expand the runway of the Tachikawa airfield. The U.S. Air Force had deemed the expansion necessary in order for the runway to accommodate larger, jet-powered bombers. The result of an order from officials of the American-occupied base, it would have involved the confiscation of farmland and the eviction of 140 families. Many of the farmers of Sunagawa village had been on the same piece of land for generations and fiercely resisted the confiscations. Local families formed the and barricaded their lands against government surveyors and their vehicles. Their struggle attracted the attention of the nationwide anti-base movement, and soon came to include regional and national labor unions affiliated with the left-leaning Sōhyō labor federation, radical student activists from the Zengakuren league of student associations, and Socialist Party Diet members. Escalation Multitudes of protestors mobilized, with a plane from the nearby airfield visible in the background, October 1956 The struggle escalated dramatically when police were sent in to remove the barricades. Since Sunagawa was very close to Tokyo, Zengakuren began busing in large numbers of students from Tokyo-area universities to bolster the manpower of the farmers. The protests began to take on larger, nationwide implications, rhetorically portrayed as a decisive battle to protect Japan's \\"Peace Constitution\\" and resist American imperialism. Soon the struggle became a media spectacle. Realizing they were in front of television cameras and receiving daily news coverage, the students of Zengakuren pioneered a new type of protest tactic. Unlike earlier student protesters, who had often armed themselves in their clashes with police, the Sunagawa protesters made a point of sitting in unarmed. Wearing white shirts and white headbands to make the blood more visible, they deliberately allowed the police to beat them without resisting. The one-sided violence at Sunagawa proved successful in attracting sympathy to the protesters, leading to more favorable media coverage and further growth of the movement, and earning the struggle the sobriquet . Climax and resolution Police and protestors clashing, September 1955 The climax of the protests came in October 1956, when two thousand police officers, trying to evict the farmers, attacked six thousand protesters, resulting in a thousand people injured. Despite the violence however, the police were not able to dislodge the protesters. Due to popular disapproval, the police were never able to mount such a violent attack again. With the surveyors unable to conduct their work to prepare for the runway expansion, the expansion plans were \\"indefinitely shelved\\" in late 1957, after which time the protests died away. For a time, the U.S. military still maintained hopes that the runway expansion might be restarted after some time had passed, forcing the farmers to maintain some of their barricades indefinitely. However, in 1968, the U.S. Air Force officially gave notification to the Japanese government of cancellation of the expansion plans. In 1977, following the conclusion of the Vietnam War, the base was handed over to the Japanese Self Defense Forces. Impact The Sunagawa case not only led to the shelving of the runway expansion plans, but also helped convey to both Japanese and American leaders the magnitude of popular antipathy in Japan against US-occupied military bases. In part thanks to the bloody spectacle at Sunagawa, the Eisenhower administration in 1957 announced a massive 40 percent drawdown of U.S. troops in Japan, including all ground troops. Historian Jennifer M. Miller has argued that the Sunagawa protests also convinced the United States to renegotiate the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty on new terms more favorable to Japan. In addition, the tactics of unarmed protest pioneered by the Zengakuren students at Sunagawa were reused to even more effect in the 1960 Anpo Protests against the new, revised Treaty. Sunagawa Case Amidst the protests, on July 8, 1957, in an event known as the , some protestors infiltrated the air base itself, and seven of them were arrested and charged with trespassing. Their case became a cause célèbre as it wound its way through the courts. In the 1959 Sunagawa Case (Sakata v. Japan), the Tokyo District Court initially found the U.S. bases, as well as the entire U.S.–Japan Security Treaty, unconstitutional and fully exonerated the protestors. However, the decision was rapidly overturned by the Supreme Court.

The school is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist school system, the second largest Christian school system in the world. History FVAA traces its roots back to a school that was founded by the Langley Seventh-day Adventist church, in the late 1940s. This original school operated as a K-9 school, and employed two teachers. This school was one of many small Adventist schools in the area. In the late 60s, five area Adventist churches--Langley, Aldergrove, Mission, Chilliwack, and White Rock—decided that it would be best if they merged their schools and created one large school to serve the entire Fraser Valley region. A property was purchased, just north of Aldergrove, and construction began on the new school building. The school was named Fraser Valley Adventist Academy. The first classes met in September 1971, before the school building was completed. The first year, grades K-10 were offered, and in 1974, grades 11 and 12 were added, making the school a full K-12 academy. Several more expansions were added to the facility shortly afterwards: first a gym and office building; then another classroom building was added to the back of the gym; and then in the early 90s, a new high school wing was built. Enrollment has fluctuated between 200-300 students throughout the school's history. Student Body Students are generally drawn from Surrey, BC east to Chilliwack, BC, on both sides of the Fraser River including Langley, Abbotsford, Mission, Maple Ridge and from communities in Whatcom County, Washington state. FVAA accepts international students each year. Enrollment for the 2014-2015 year was 206 students in grades K - 12 and included 28 international students from Asia, South America and the United States. Academics FVAA is accredited by the British Columbia Ministry of Education, and by the Board of Regents of the General Conference of Seventh- day Adventists. The school teaches the curriculum established by the British Columbia Ministry of Education, and also follows the curriculum established by the North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists for its religion courses. Graduates of FVAA receive the Dogwood Diploma when they complete Grade 12. The school employs 15 teachers and 11 staff, maintaining a 16:1 student to teacher ratio. Subjects offered include english, math, biology, chemistry, physics, socials, physical education, and music, as well as numerous electives. The school is owned and operated by the British Columbia Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Transportation FVAA contracts withValley Student Transportation Association' (or VSTA) for transportation of students to and from school. These school buses pick up students in Surrey, Langley, Aldergrove, and Abbotsford, and are responsible for bringing them to school. VSTA also provides transportation for school field trips. Extracurriculars The FVAA Royals are a member of the Greater Vancouver Independent Schools Athletic Association, competing in boys and girls volleyball and basketball. FVAA is also a member of the Canadian Adventist Schools Athletics association, competing in flag football and volleyball. The Royals also regularly compete in tournaments hosted by Burman University and Walla Walla University, in soccer, volleyball, and basketball. The current athletic director is Kyle Kay. Fraser Valley has a music program consisting of a senior band and choir, and various bands, choirs, and an orchestra for younger students. High school students go on a music tour every other year. The current music director is Jean Bay. FVAA goes on a mission trip every other year, on years in which there is no music tour. The most recent mission trip was to Belize, in March 2017, during which FVAA students helped build a school near Santa Elena, held a Vacation Bible School, and hosted a daily radio program on Faith FM.

It subsequently expanded to cover military medical research projects (primarily involving infectious diseases) across much of Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent. Mission and history The mission of the US Army Medical Component of the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) is to conduct basic and applied research for development of diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines for infectious diseases of military importance. First formed as the SEATO Lab following the 1956-8 Cholera pandemic, USAMC-AFRIMS is an agency of the US Embassy Thailand residing at the Royal Thai Army Medical Center in Bangkok. AFRIMS is a special foreign activity of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and part of the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC). AFRIMS is part of a global network of Department of Defense overseas medical research laboratories located in Jakarta, Indonesia; Lima, Peru; Nairobi, Kenya; and Cairo, Egypt. USAMC-AFRIMS has nearly 300 staff members (Thai and USA) and a research budget of approximately $5–7 million annually. Research The major infectious disease threats to soldiers in South East Asia include drug resistant malaria, diarrhea and dysentery, dengue fever, HIV, hepatitis, and scrub typhus. These agents pose health risks to soldiers as well as to the civilian population, and thus form the major areas of research at AFRIMS. Research is predominantly applied research aimed towards finding, developing and testing new drugs and vaccines. New medications currently under development are for the treatment and prevention of multiple drug resistant malaria. Vaccines for dysentery, dengue fever, hepatitis E and HIV are also under development at AFRIMS. Products originally field tested or developed at AFRIMS include Hepatitis A Vaccine, Japanese B Encephalitis Vaccine, doxycycline prophylaxis for malaria, mefloquine antimalarial drug prevention, and halofantrine antimalarial drug treatment. AFRIMS also conducts surveillance of emerging diseases such as drug resistant P falciparum malaria, Diarrhea agents: Campylobacter, Cholera O139, Cyclospora, E coli, Hepatitis E, HIV 1 E clade, drug resistant scrub typhus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and influenza. The laboratory has over 30 field sites in Thailand, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

In the collection of Upanishads under the title Oupanekhat, put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Maha is listed at number 16. Dara Shikoh's collection was in the same order as found in Upanishad anthologies popular in north India. In the 52 Upanishads version of Colebrook this Upanishad is listed at 9. In the Bibliothica Indica edition of Narayana the Upanishad is also listed at 9 in his list of 52 Upanishads popular in South India. Contents The Upanishad presents Vishnu as the highest being, above Samkhya principles, above Shiva, and above Brahma. This Upanishadic text competes with Shaiva Upanishads, such as the Atharvashikha Upanishad and Atharvashiras Upanishad, which asserts Shiva as higher than Vishnu and Brahma. Both groups, however, use profusely reverential words in describing all three – Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (or Maheshvara, Rudra), and identify them as manifestations of the same universal Atman-Brahman (ultimate reality). The text references and uses fragments of Vedic hymns, such as from Taittiriya Brahmana section 2.2 and Shatapatha Brahmana section 6.1, but reformulates them in the image of Vishnu. He as Brahman is the origin of the universe, asserts the text, from whom arose Purusha, Atman and Prakriti (nature, substances, body) of Samkhya philosophy. For the last two concepts, the Upanishad uses the term Tejas. Thereafter, from Narayana, arose Shiva and Brahma, the Om, the cosmic chants and songs, the meters of literature, then the Vedas. The text shares some verses with another Vaishnava text – the Mahanarayana Upanishad, and a Shaiva Upanishad – the Atharvashiras. The longer version of the text, which is attached to Samaveda, includes the shorter version as first part and then presents more text. It goes on to describe the path to liberation and bliss as one of realizing one's soul, of Brahman as knowledge and Vishnu.AG Krishna Warrier (1953), Maha Upanishad, Theosophical Society, Madras, Online, Verse II.1–11 A liberated person is Jivanmukta, states the text, and is characterized by one who is untouched whether joy or grief befalls him, doesn't get angry at anyone or anything, neither is mean to anyone nor fears anyone, is free from desire and non-desire, is introverted and likes his own company, is silent and without arrogance, acts without envy or agitation, is detached and functions without cravings, is quiet and calm, active and full in spirit.AG Krishna Warrier (1953), Maha Upanishad, Theosophical Society, Madras, Online, Verse II.42–62 He is self-restrained, driven by inquiry, in company of good people, studies the Shastras, asks, \\"Who am I? How did Samsara develop?\\"AG Krishna Warrier (1953), Maha Upanishad, Theosophical Society, Madras, Online, Verse IV.1–24 The drink of immortality for him, states the Upanishad, is his delight in the Self (soul, Atman), experiencing the joy of his own inner awareness and nature.AG Krishna Warrier (1953), Maha Upanishad, Theosophical Society, Madras, Online, Verses IV.34–39 \\"world is a family\\" verse of Maha Upanishad is engraved in the entrance hall of the Parliament Of India. The Vishnu-focussed text is notable for describing Shiva as the trident holding one, states Deussen, who possesses beauty, truth, chastity, austerity, renunciation, intelligence and mastery. The Upanishad is oft-quoted ancient text for the credo, \\"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\\" (Sanskrit: वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्), or \\"the world constitutes but one family\\".Robin Seelan (2015), Deconstructing Global Citizenship (Editors: Hassan Bashir and Phillips Gray), Routledge, , page 143AG Krishna Warrier (1953), Maha Upanishad, Theosophical Society, Madras, Online, Verse VI.71–72 This verse of Maha Upanishad is engraved in the entrance hall of the parliament of India.S Shah and V Ramamoorthy (2014), Soulful Corporations, Springer Science, , page 449 The text has been influential in the major Hindu literature that followed it. The popular Bhagavata Purana, composed sometime between 500 CE and 1000 CE, the most translated of the Purana genre of literature in Hinduism, for example, calls the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam adage of the Maha Upanishad, as the \\"loftiest Vedantic thought\\". This adage, according to Chung Tan, influenced the Chinese culture and is an example of \\"dynamics of boundarylessness of a Himalaya Sphere phenomenon, viz. Chinese culture with Indian input\\".

It operates a digital wireless and wireline network in rural Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Shentel operates its wireless division as a T-Mobile (formerly Sprint) affiliate, serving 1,006,874 subscribers. History Shentel was founded in January 1902 as the Farmers' Mutual Telephone System of Shenandoah County (FMTS). This was one of a number of Farmers' Mutual telephone systems established in rural areas of the United States. The company's initial goal was to bring telephone service to rural residents of Shenandoah County, VA. In 1960 the name changed to Shenandoah Telephone Company, then in 1981 to Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (Shentel). The company launched cable TV service and a fiber optic network in the 1980s. In 1984 Shentel added mobile and paging services. In 1990 Shentel launched Shenandoah Cellular, the first company in Virginia to offer cellular service to a rural area. Internet service was made available to Shentel customers in 1994. In the 2000s Shentel began to expand its cable footprint - purchasing cable assets from Rapid Communications in Virginia and West Virginia in 2008, and acquiring JetBroadband in southern Virginia and southern West Virginia in 2010. Later in 2010, Shentel purchased two small cable systems from Suddenlink Communications (one in West Virginia, the other in Maryland). In May 2016, Shentel finished acquiring its competitor Ntelos for 640 million dollars. acquiring 297,500 subscribers. The deal also transferred an additional 291,000 subscribers from Sprint in exchange for Ntelos spectrum, making Shentel the sixth largest public wireless company in the United States.

Later in life, in addition to directing films, he also performed on the Hardanger fiddle. When the Norwegian Theater opened in 1913, he started acting at the theater. He became engaged with the new medium of film after seeing Peter Lykke-Seest's productions, and he decided to produce films in a completely different way. His first film was Fante-Anne (Gypsy Anne, 1920). In an interview he stated that \\"the film was the beginning of something, a Norwegian production with a more national character.\\"Norsk filmhistorie 1920–1930 bonde- og nasjonalromantikken.

With these films, he challenged Swedish films' former position of power and pleased both critics and audiences. After audio films were invented, Breistein solidified his reputation as a director of the popular films Ungen (The Child, 1938) and Trysil-Knut (Knut from Trysil, 1942).

She was the first to complete a study on the ecology of plant life at high elevations, primarily in the Sexten Dolomites range. She later moved on to studying the Schiara range, including Monte Serva. Her research included a statistical analysis of plants at various elevations, which explained the distribution of various species. In 1942 Zenari published a monograph entitled Contributo alla conoscenza della flora del Comelico (alto Cadore): note di critica sistematica, which described various groups of organisms in the Comelico region. Zenari's work on vegetation in the Dolomites was the last significant phytosociological research completed in the Dolomites for thirty years.

Taxonomy The specific name, ruhstrati, was chosen to honor German-born Ernst Konrad A. Ruhstrat (died 1913), of the Imperial Chinese Customs Service, who collected the type specimens of this species in southern Taiwan.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Lycodon ruhstrati, p. 229). Lycodon ruhstrati is a member of the genus Lycodon, a genus of snakes commonly known as wolf snakes. The genus belongs to the snake family Colubridae. Colubridae is the largest snake family, with member genera and species being found on every continent except Antarctica. The genus Lycodon has at times been placed in the genus Oligodon, but this classification is under dispute. The species Lycodon multifasciatus was previously listed as a subspecies of L. ruhstrati, being classified as Lycodon ruhstrati multifasciatus in 1984. However, in 2008 it was classified as a separate species as Lycodon multifasciatus. The species Dinodon futsingensis, first described in 1928, was synonymised with Lycodon ruhstrati in 1929. However, in 2009 it was recognized as a separate species, and named Lycodon futsingensis. In 2013, the genetic sequence of L. ruhsrati was used as part of a study which suggested combining the genera Lycodon and Dinodon. L. ruhstrati currently has two subspecies: Lycodon ruhstrati ruhstrati , the nominate subspecies, first described from Taiwan; and Lycodon ruhstrati abditus , described from Vietnam. Description The color pattern of L. ruhstrati is highly variable, although it tends to be dark-colored with several light- colored crossbands on its back. The largest specimen found prior to 2008 had a total length (including tail) of . Habitat and ecology L. ruhstrati is oviparous, or egg-laying, with females laying four eggs in each clutch. It is a montane species and is found on slopes, in caves, and beneath stones in mountain streams. It is also found in agricultural land and both natural and plantation forests in the foothills. The snake is known to predate upon the brown anole, Anoles sagrei, as well as upon Diploderma swinhonis. Range and distribution L. ruhstrati occurs in the Tranninh Plateau of Laos, in northern Vietnam, and a number of locations in southern China. It has been found in Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guanxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Zhejiang. The subspecies Lycodon ruhstrati multifasciatus has also been found in Japan's Ryukyu islands; however, this subspecies was subsequently reclassified as a separate species. L. ruhstrati is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, because it is presumed to have a large population and to be distributed over a large area. It is also not thought to be declining very fast. No steps are currently being taken to specifically conserve this species, although it is thought to be found in a number of protected areas.

It was designed by Charles Dalton Lynch and Walter Hunt and built from 1920 to 1921 by Joseph Rooney. It is also known as St Joseph on The Strand. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999.  History  St Joseph's Church was designed by Townsville architectural firm Charles Dalton Lynch and Walter Hunt, and was constructed by Townsville building firm Rooney Ltd in 1920-1921. The new settlement of Cleveland Bay, established in 1864 at the mouth of Ross Creek, was part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brisbane. The first priest in the northern section of the new diocese was Fr William McGinty who established a parish centred on Bowen. Fr McGinty first visited Townsville (Cleveland Bay) in 1866 where he performed baptisms on 16 February and said Mass on the following Sunday in the Court and Customs House on Melton Hill. left It was not until 1872 that the parish of Townsville was established with Fr Connolly as parish priest. The first church in the new parish, St Joseph's, was opened by Fr Connolly in 1872. The new timber building was located on The Strand close to the site of the present church. This church, which was the first constructed in the town, was destroyed by flood waters which swept the building out to sea during torrential rain in 1892.St. Josephs Church and Convent, 1888In 1878, because of the vastness of the Queensland Vicariate, Bishop James Quinn, Bishop of Queensland, proposed that three new dioceses be established with one centred on Townsville. However, in 1882 only one new Queensland diocese was established with Rockhampton as its centre. Townsville waited a further fifty-two years before a diocese was established in the north. Despite the disappointment Catholics in Townsville continued planning for the establishment of a Townsville Diocese. A great deal of work was done to establish Catholic institutions, religious orders and new parishes in the north Queensland portion of the Rockhampton Diocese. Part of this expansion included the construction of new schools and churches, including the Sacred Heart Cathedral, which was planned to be the cathedral church of the hoped-for Townsville diocese. Because of the focus on the expansion of the Catholic Church across North Queensland during the later part of the nineteenth century, planning for a new St Joseph's Church did not begin until 1918. The new building was designed by Townsville architectural firm CD Lynch and Walter Hunt. The foundation stone was laid by Bishop of Rockhampton Joseph Shiel in January 1919. The building was constructed by Joseph Rooney of the well known north Queensland building firm of Rooneys Ltd. The new church was opened on Sunday 10 July 1921 by Bishop Shiel with Archbishop of Brisbane James Duhig in attendance. The new church, which faced Fryer Street, was located close to the site of the original church which had faced the Strand. The altar, which was designed by parish priest Monsignor Bourke, was crafted by Joseph Rooney in memory of Matthew Rooney and his wife and daughter, who lost their lives when the ship Yongala sank off Cape Cleveland in 1911. Since the construction of the first church on the site in 1872, St Joseph's Church and parish has been a focus for Catholic community worship and activity. Key church organisations have been located close by, including the parish presbytery, a Catholic orphanage, St Joseph's Primary School (established in 1875) and St Patrick's Secondary Day/Boarding School (established in 1905). Small extensions, which were added to the church in the 1950s, increased the size of the rooms on either side of the altar. Some changes were made to the interior layout in the 1980s. The creation of a raised platform with a modern altar was in keeping with the changes recommended by the Second Vatican Council. These changes saw the removal of some pews and most of the statues; however the Rooney Commemorative Altar was not removed.  Description  Side view, 2006 St Joseph's Church, a reinforced concrete structure with a corrugated iron gable roof to the nave and lower skillion roofs to the side aisles, is located on a level site fronting Fryer Street to the southeast. The church consists of the original central section which has had arcades added to both sides with vestries at the rear. The southeast elevation is a symmetrical composition with a central pointed arch entrance with timber doors flanked by lancet shaped niches. The central entrance is surmounted by a large plate tracery window which comprises five lancets surmounted by two quatrefoils and a central foil with eight sections, and framed by an expressed moulding. A crucifix window is located above this window, and a small crucifix surmounts the gable parapet. The central section of this elevation is flanked by paired buttresses which separate the lower side aisles. The side aisles each have a pointed arch entrance with timber doors surmounted by a crucifix window. The side aisles are framed by paired buttresses (originally a single buttress, with the second buttress added as part of the side arcade). The church is accessed via concrete steps fronting Fryer Street. A marble foundation stone is located adjacent to the main entrance. Both side elevations are similar, and each consists of a pointed arch arcade with parapet concealing a skillion roof to the side aisle. The pointed arches are separated by pilasters which extend above the parapet giving a castellated effect. Each arcade has a concrete floor, and a vestry is located at the rear. The windows to the side aisles are separated by buttresses, and consist of triple leadlight lancets with lower casements sections set in a pointed arch composition. Paired timber doors housed in a pointed arch open from the side aisle to the arcade. Each vestry projects from the arcade, and the side wall has six narrow pointed lancet windows, and a pointed arch timber door opens to the rear. The clerestory to the nave has paired leadlight lancets set in a pointed arch recess. The southwestern side has a concrete ramp with metal handrail accessing the arcade. The rear of the building has less decorative mouldings with buttresses separating two leadlight windows, each of which consists of tall paired lancets either side of the central altar. A circular leadlight window with central quatrefoil is located at the top of the gable. The location of original doors is evidenced by pointed arch recesses at the rear of the side aisles. Internally, the building has a timber gallery above the entrance accessed by a corner timber stair with turned balusters. The side aisles are separated from the nave by concrete columns surmounted by pointed arches with expressed mouldings. The building has a concrete floor, and the nave has a scissor braced King-post roof with curved side braces and lined with diagonal boarding. The church has a highly decorative carved timber altar, set against the rear wall on a raised platform, comprising a tiered arrangement of pointed arch niches housing statues and surmounted by a crucifix. The rear wall has timber panelling to the height of the column capital, and the northeastern side aisle has a carved timber altar and timber altar rail. A memorial plaque to Monsignor Bourke is located on the wall of the northeastern side aisle. Church furniture includes timber pews and decorative Stations of the Cross. The Fryer Street boundary is fenced with concrete pillars with pointed arch recesses and metal palisade panels.  Heritage listing  St Joseph's Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Joseph's Church, erected in 1920-21 with additions carried out in the 1950s, is important in demonstrating the establishment and growth of the Catholic Church in North Queensland.

The territory is one of mountain tundra, rivers and lakes, and taiga forests. It includes the headwaters of the left and right tributaries of the Bureya River, part of the lower Amur River basin. The reserve was created in 1987, and covers an area of . Topography The Bureya Reserve covers the Left Bureya and Right Bureya River, which combine into the Bureya River as it flows south into the Amur River. It is surrounded by mountain ranges - the Ezopskim to the north, Dusse-Alin to the east, and the Bureya Massif] to the south. The mountains in the reserve itself range in height from to , and because the reserve sits at the meeting points of several faults. The tops of the river valleys are often convex-shaped bald mountains. The headwaters of many streams are glacial cirques, and lower levels along the rivers feature floodplains and lakes; in between the river valleys are generally too steep for terraces and the tributaries of the Bureya are often in rapids. Because the winters are relatively dry, the Spring floods are small; the summer floods are larger due to the seasonal rains. The reserve is remote: the closest town, Sophisk, is 40 km west of the border. There are no roads in the reserve. Lake Korbohon Climate and Ecoregion Bureya is the largest protected area in the \\"Okhotsk-Manchurian taiga\\" ecoregion. This region of coniferous taiga is at the northernmost extent of Manchurian flora communities, while also supporting the southwestern range of Okhostsk- Kamchatka/Beringia communities. It is affected by the climatic influence of the Pacific Ocean, which causes warmer winters and cooler summers than areas further from the ocean. The reserve is important for large mammals including bear, wolverine and sable. Bureya has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dwc). characterized by cool summers, and very dry cold winters, moderated slightly in the case of Bureya by the relative proximity of the ocean. Flora and fauna The Bureya Reserve has never been subject to the commercial harvesting of timber; any clearing of tree cover has come from natural causes (fires, landslides). The peaks are bare rock with lichen, below that is a zone of alpine meadows. Below 1,100 meters the forest zone begins; the middle slopes are covered with larch forests, spruce-fir forests, thickets of cedar, and on the lowest level there are floodplain intra-zonal forests. The animals are represented by the typical Okhotsk-Kamchatka forest species, including brown bear, ermine, sable, hare, squirrel, and wolverine. Upper elevations feature alpine species such as ptarmigan and pika. The reserve has recorded 190 species of birds, with 89 known to nest in the territory. Management The reserve has a visitor center and nature museum open to the public. The park sponsors 3-hour helicopter tours of the territory, rafting trips on the Right Bureya River, and allows limited access to three hiking trails in supervised groups with permits. The hiking trails are to notable sights - Bear Lake, Lake Korbohon, \\"The Kings Highway\\", and waterfalls of the Kuraygagna River.

A close associate of the Beijing mayor and Politburo member Chen Xitong, Wang committed suicide in April 1995 when he came under investigation for embezzlement of public funds. His suicide led to the resignation and the eventual conviction of Chen on corruption charges. Life and career Wang was born in Fangshan, Hebei Province (now in Beijing). He joined the Chinese Communist Party in January 1955. He was a longtime close associate of Chen Xitong, who was mayor and Party Committee Secretary of Beijing and a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China. Wang served as deputy mayor and chief of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Finance under Chen. Wang and Chen used US$4 million of public funds to build luxury villas for use by themselves and their mistresses. In mid-1994, their embezzlement scheme was exposed during an investigation into an illegal fund-raising scheme with the Wuxi Xinxing Company based in Jiangsu Province. The company had promised investors very high returns (5–10% per month), and bribed officials in 12 provinces to invest public funds into the company. When the company collapsed and could not repay the investors' capital, the authorities launched an investigation, which discovered that Wang had invested US$12 million worth of public funds belonging to the Beijing municipal government into Wuxi Xinxing. Death On 4 April 1995, before a scheduled interview with investigators from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Wang killed himself with a gunshot in suburban Huairou County. Wang was posthumously expelled from the Communist Party of China on 4 July 1995. His body was cremated in April 1998. Aftermath Wang's suicide forced Chen Xitong to take bureaucratic responsibility for Wang's embezzlement. 22 days after Wang's death, Chen apologized and resigned from all his government posts. Further investigations exposed the corruption of Chen and his son Chen Xiaotong, who were found to have taken bribes from a real estate developer in exchange for the permit to build apartments at a prime location in downtown Beijing. Chen Xitong was expelled from the Politburo in 1995 and was later sentenced to 16 years in prison. The downfall of Wang Baosen and Chen Xitong was seen as a victory of the \\"Shanghai clique\\" led by Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin over Chen's \\"Beijing clique\\". In January 1997, writer Chen Fang (1945–2005) published the blockbuster novel Heaven's Wrath based on the Wang Baosen–Chen Xitong case. The Chinese authorities banned the book after three months, for \\"leaking state secrets\\", which caused sales of pirated versions of the book to skyrocket, reportedly reaching five million copies.

When the radioactive atoms decay, they emit fast charged particles (e.g., α-particles and β-particles). Because of their charge, the emitted particles interact in characteristic ways with the electrons and nuclei of the crystal atoms, giving rise to channeling and blocking directions for the particle escaping the crystal. The intensity (or yield) of the emitted particles is therefore dependent on the position of the detector relative to crystal planes and axes. This fact is used to infer the location of the radioactive species in the lattice by varying the emission angles and subsequent comparison to simulation results. For the simulations, the manybeam formalism can be employed, and resolutions below 1 Å are achievable. Among others, the technique has been used to determine the sites of Manganese impurities implanted in semiconducting Gallium arsenide: 70% occupy substitutional Gallium sites and 28% are located at tetrahedral interstitial sites with Arsenic as nearest neighbors.

P. de la República, 1999 was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. Hastily formed in the winter in Catalonia shortly before the end of the war in order to defend the beleaguered Spanish Republic, it would be the only mixed brigade of the 77th Division, the last division to be established. History=Incomplete formation of the brigade= The decision to establish the 245th Mixed Brigade was taken in December 1938 in Catalonia, shortly before the onset of the rebel faction's unstoppable Catalonia Offensive.Carlos Engel (1999); Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del Ejército Popular de la República, p. 228 The brigade was formed in an undisclosed location and the names of the commanding officers in charge of the instruction of the hastily gathered recruits are unknown. The 245th Mixed Brigade was made part of the 77th Division, another ill-prepared and hastily established unit. Part of the 24th Army Corps of the Eastern Region Army Group (GERO), the 77th Division would be the last Spanish Republican division to be established. Like in all of the mixed brigades of the last period of the Spanish republic, the officers were drafted from the reserve.Carlos Engel (1999); Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del Ejército Popular de la República, p. 227 =Failure of the Line of Resistance and extinction= Without being adequately equipped the 245th Mixed Brigade was sent to the Tordera River in the last week of January 1939, around the time of the Fall of Barcelona. Its mission was to attempt to establish a defensive line for which, together with the 242nd Mixed Brigade which was posted further downriver, it took positions along the middle course of the Tordera. The aim was to halt the swift advance of the enemy, but at the end of the month the idea of a Line of Resistance was abandoned by the high command as unrealistic owing to the lack of battle-ready Republican units and the overwhelming pressure of the rebel forces. The 245th Mixed Brigade was sent then across the Montseny Massif to Vic in order to defend the town. But the march across the mountain range in the cold winter weather, and without proper food supplies and equipment, was an arduous task. Once near Vic the brigade tried to halt the enemy advance against the town, but it had to withdraw in the face of the fierce rebel onslaught and quickly fell apart, the scattered remainders of the unit being unable to regroup. By 1 February to all effects the 245th Mixed Brigade was disbanded.

Inouye College of Pharmacy is one of six colleges within the public University of Hawai'i at Hilo (UH Hilo). The school awards a four-year Doctor of Pharmacy degree (Pharm.D.) and is by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. The College of Pharmacy was founded in 2007 and graduated its inaugural class in 2011. It is the only pharmacy school in the state of Hawai'i.  History = Daniel K. Inouye = The late United States Senator Daniel K. Inouye, after whom the school is named, broached the idea of establishing a school of pharmacy in Hawai'i in 1998. Before that, he had supported of rural America, sponsoring bills providing better education and healthcare in under-served areas. The senator secured funding for the school in 2001, and by the end of 2004, the state legislature allotted approximately $20 million for the development of the college of pharmacy. Later that year, the legislature approved a search for a dean. In 2011 Senator Inouye introduced the Pharmacist Student Loan Repayment Eligibility Act of 2011, which helped student pharmacists afford their educations. = Accreditation = The ACPE granted the college accreditation in 2011. = Emblem = The school's emblem is a torch entwined by a snake superimposed on the outline of the volcano Kilauea. The torch symbolizes enlightenment. The serpent, seen on the Rod of Asclepius or Bowl of Hygeia, is the symbol of medicine or pharmacy, respectively. The volcano pays homage to the college's home and emphasizes its unique environment in which to learn and practice pharmacy.  Campus  The campus consists of four main buildings located adjacent to the main UH Hilo campus. Across the intersection is the ʻImiloa Astronomy Center. One building houses laboratories for research projects by the faculty and students. The main lecture halls consist of two large rooms accommodating roughly 90 students. The campus also has a mock pharmacy, where students may practice counseling or participate in practical exams. The DKICP also has laboratory operations at the Panaʻewa Rainforest Zoo & Gardens, located roughly fifteen minutes south of Hilo, and faculty offices at the Hilo Medical Center. The Hawaiʻi Island Family Health Center is a partner with the campus and clinical pharmacy professors work on site. In 2010, Governor Linda Lingle approved funding requests and the schematics for a permanent campus were introduced in 2011. As of 2018, the building remains under construction.  Academics = Pharm.D. = The DKICP offers the Doctor of Pharmacy degree to students who complete the four-year program which consists of six semesters plus a fourth year dedicated to rotations. The first year of the program is primarily an introduction to important pharmacy topics, such as \\"Self-Care\\" and \\"Biostatistics\\". The second and third years cover \\"integrated therapeutics,\\" which encompasses pathophysiology, pharmacology of treatments, medicinal chemistry, and therapeutics. Other core classes are: \\"Communications for Pharmacists\\", \\"Healthcare Systems\\" and \\"Complementary Medicine\\". There are also electives, such as \\"veterinary medicine\\", and a full semester course that focuses on antibiotics. During these first three years of schooling, introductory experiential courses are embedded throughout the semester and also during a rotational block in the summer each year. This allows students to gradually merge textbook learning and hands-on experience. The fourth and final year is dedicated to advanced experiential courses, which are divided into six-week blocks with four required core rotations and several elective rotations. = BAPS Program = The Bachelor of Arts in Pharmacy Studies (BAPS) is an option for students who are accepted to the school without completing the undergraduate degree. = Ph.D. Program = The Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Sciences is focused on \\"natural products discovery and development\\". This program takes full advantage of the fact that the DKICP is located on an island with a unique diverse flora. = Pre-Pharmacy Program = This is a preparatory program that guides undergraduate students toward becoming competitive candidates for any Doctor of Pharmacy program. The curriculum for the Pre-Pharmacy Program is about two to three years long and does not guarantee acceptance into DKICP. = M.S. Clinical Psychopharmacology = The Master of Science in Clinical Psychopharmacology (MSCP) degree is a two-year program involving both didactic and experiential courses. The program requires a doctoral degree in clinical psychology with an active license. Reputation & Community Involvement *Every year, students of the DKICP host a health fair for the community, providing free screening, educational booths on diseases and medications, counseling, vaccinations and other services. *The American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education published a review of available literature regarding rural health pharmacy education throughout the United States. In this review, it underlined the DKICP's ongoing efforts in improving \\"health care not only to rural areas but to all areas of the state\\". *With the opening of the DKICP, pharmacy residency programs in Hawai'i have doubled to twelve total resident positions throughout the state. *Beyond the obvious health benefits of having a clinical college in the area, a study was conducted to gauge the positive economic impact of the school on the local community which it estimated to be a $50 million stimulus. This was considered an underestimate upon further review because it did not take into account extramural funding, such as awards and grants earned by the DKICP, which \\"has exceeded $40 million\\". *Between 2011 and 2012, the Narcotics Enforcement Division, which handles Hawaii's Uniform Controlled Substance Act, and the DKICP partnered and collected more than 3.5 metric tons of unused or unwanted medications that needed to be disposed of safely. These medications would have otherwise been disposed of down toilets, drains and dumps.

It premiered on FOX on October 20, 2014 and was written by Rebecca Perry Cutter and directed by Tim Hunter. In the episode, detectives Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) are investigating a new street drug that causes euphoria and then death. Meanwhile, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) works his way deeper into Maroni’s (David Zayas) inner circle and Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) continues to plot to take down Falcone (John Doman). The episode was watched by 6.09 million viewers but received mixed reviews, mostly for lack of character development. Plot Bruce (David Mazouz) plans to find a way to speak to the board members of Wayne Enterprises to learn their connections to the Arkham District Project. Later, a street player who received a toxic drug with a viper logo on it consumes and becomes super strong, attacks one of the street stores, and steals an ATM. A new drug called \\"Viper\\" (which is a prototype of Venom) is hitting the street, which endows the user with super- strength, but eventually kills them. Maroni plans to rob a casino owned by Falcone (John Doman), and Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) reveals his past which results in Maroni assaulting him, and Frankie confronts Gordon, telling him to come with him or else he will reveal that Cobblepot is still alive, which would be an embarrassment for him when Falcone knows it. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) learns that \\"Viper\\" is being distributed at a charity event held by WellZyn and Wayne Enterprises. Gordon shoots the canister on the roof and former WellZyn employee Stan Potolsky (Daniel London) is exposed, jumping off as he suggests they check out Warehouse 39, where Gordon and Bullock later find nothing. As Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) makes plans to conspire against Falcone with her lover and Russian mob boss Nikolai, a disguised Liza (Makenzie Leigh) visits him in the park where she shares her opera music with him. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 6.09 million viewers, with a 2.3 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 10.12 million viewers, and a 4.0 in the 18–49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Viper\\" received mixed reviews. The episode received a rating of 62% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 26 critics, with the site's consensus stating: \\"While 'Viper' adds some much-appreciated Batman mythology to its origin story, Gotham struggles to figure out what kind of show it's going to be.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.8 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham is still figuring itself out but I think setting Wayne Enterprises itself as possibly the 'big bad' of the series was a nice step. The gang feud continues to interest me while the cases-of-the-week continue to more or less feel arbitrary and, at times, unnecessary. But at least this week's played into the larger Wayne corruption angle while also introducing the important visual of green serum and green gas to the show. I hope that the series will find the confidence to, at one point, take a break from some of the stories and not feature everything/everyone in each episode.\\" The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"The show has offered tiny crumbs in regards to these questions: Jim has a strict moral code forged during his time as a hero soldier; Harvey is complacent because he's afraid of what would happen to him if he wasn't; Fish and Oswald are both disrespected and condescended to by their superiors. But Gotham needs to give us more, and every week we get another fantastical mystery of the week instead of the grounded character development a successful cop show needs.

Album information After a ten-year hiatus from music, Davina returned to the scene as a vocalist in 2007 with the independent release of Return to Soul Vol 1; utilizing her skills as a: singer, songwriter, producer, and engineer. With this album Davina has crafted an eclectic piece of work that spans hip-hop flavored neo-soul, dreamy electronica, and drum and bass. Reviews Norman Meyers of Nu-Soul Magazine says \\"Davina sells these tracks thanks to her appropriately husky voice and honey-dipped delivery. But the album surprises halfway through with some more experimental sounds that liven things up. The skittering drum and bass staccato rhythms of \\"Stop\\" is one such track as is the broken beat \\"Walk On Bye\\". The bizarre electronics of \\"Gone\\" elevates the standard \\"get yo shit and gone\\" track into another arena.

It was built in 1864 by the Tokugawa shogunate in the Bakumatsu period, shortly before the end of the Shōgun's reign. One of many batteries built by the shogunate towards the end of its reign, the Wadamisaki Battery is the only one remaining from several that were built around Osaka Bay and is today listed in the Japanese government's register of historic sites. History After coming to power in the early 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate had kept Japan in a state of isolation (sakoku) for a period of more than 250 years. This isolation was brought to an end in the 1850s by the arrival of American and British forces who demanded the opening of Japan's ports to trade. After initial resistance the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed between the United States in July 1858 and Hyogo Port was opened to American trade on 1 January 1860. Fearing Japan could be colonised by Western forces, the defence of Hyogo Port was upgraded with the construction of the Wadamisaki Battery. It was one of several batteries constructed around Osaka Bay under the orders of Count Katsu Kaishū, who was also responsible for establishing the Kobe Naval Training Center near the Wadamisaki Battery. The battery was designed by and the contractor was . It was completed in 1864 after approximately 15 to 18 months of construction and at a cost of approximately 25,000 ryō. With the full opening of Hyogo Port (modern day Kobe Port) on 1 January 1868, the batteries that lined the coast of Osaka Bay were no longer required despite never being put to use. Of the other batteries built in Hyogo Prefecture during the 1860s, only the outer granite wall of the Nishinomiya Battery remains after its wooden internal structure was destroyed by fire in 1884. All of the other batteries were sold off to private individuals and demolished during the Meiji period. In 1872 the Hyogo prefecture government decided to sell the Wadamisaki Battery site also, however the governor of the prefecture overruled the decision and it remained public property. The site was eventually sold to Hyōgo Sōko in 1896, who in turn sold it the following year to the , which at the time was the parent company of the Mitsubishi group of companies. On 3 March 1921 the battery was registered as a historic site by the national government, the first in Hyogo Prefecture. It underwent its first major repairs from October 1926 to January 1927, during which steel supports were added to support the roof. The battery survived the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, although it left cracks in the granite walls and the entire structure tilted seven centimetres. It underwent renovation in 2009 to dismantle and repair the wooden interior and make repairs to the wooden exterior; this work was completed in 2014. Construction The outer enceinte was built of granite from the Shiwaku Islands and the inner two-storey structure was made of keyaki (Japanese elm) wood harvested from the Nunobiki and Tekkai mountains in Kobe. Current status The battery now lies within the compound of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Kobe shipyards. The first floor is open to viewing (with prior booking) once a month and for small group tours upon prior arrangement.
