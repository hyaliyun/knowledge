It presents graphs as a node-link diagram, but unlike other graph drawing tools that depict the nodes using discrete symbols, it represents nodes using horizontal lines.  Rationale  Traditional node-link methods for visualizing networks deteriorate in terms of legibility when dealing with large networks, due to the proliferation of edge crossings amassing as what are disparagingly termed 'hairballs'. BioFabric is one of a number of alternative approaches designed explicitly to tackle this scalability issue, choosing to do so by depicting nodes as lines on the horizontal axis, one per row; edges as lines on the vertical axis, one per column, terminating at the two rows associated with the endpoint nodes. As such, nodes and edges are each provided their own dimension (as opposed to solely the edges with nodes being non-dimensional points). BioFabric exploits the additional degree of freedom thus produced to place ends of incident edges in groups. This placement can potentially carry semantic information, whereas in node-link graphics the placement is often arbitrarily generated within constraints for aesthetics, such as during force-directed graph drawing, and may result in apparently informative artifacts. Edges are drawn (vertically) in a darker shade than (horizontal) nodes, creating visual distinction. Additional edges increase the width of the graph. Both ends of a link are represented as a square to reinforce the above effect even at small scales. Directed graphs also incorporate arrowheads.  Development  The first version, 1.0.0, was released in July 2012. Development work on BioFabric is ongoing. An open source R implementation was released in 2013, RBioFabric, for use with the igraph package, and subsequently described on the project weblog.  Features  Input * Networks can be imported using SIF files as input.  Related Work  Blakley et al. have described how the technique used by BioFabric, which they refer to as a cartographic representation, can be used to compare the networks A and B by juxtaposing the edges in (A ‚àñ B), (A ‚à© B), and (B ‚àñ A), a technique that is evocative of a Venn Diagram. Rossi and Magnani. have developed ranked sociograms, which is a BioFabric-like presentation where the node ordering is based upon a ranking metric. This approach attaches semantic meaning to the length of the edge lines, and can be used to visualize the assortativity or dissortativity of a network.

Leader of the secular liberal Afek Tounes party, he was appointed Minister of Development, Investment and International Cooperation in February 2015. Early life and education Born 1966 in Mahdia, Brahim was raised in Bizerte by Tunisian Air Force officer Mahfoudh Brahim and his mother, a teacher and daughter of revolutionary Abdelaziz Mastouri. When he was ten years old, they moved to Carthage where Brahim visited secondary school. With a stipend of the Tunisian government, he left Tunisia in 1983 for a preparatory course in Toulouse, France. In 1989 he received his diploma in Engineering at √âcole Centrale Paris. Professional career Brahim subsequently worked for Cap Gemini. A job with French bank Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale led him back to Tunisia, where in 2000 he founded his own information services company 2ic which in 2004 he sold to French company Teamlog. He joined financial software company Ubitrade and when his company was sold to GL Trade in 2006, he moved to London being appointed general director of the new company, which he led into the following acquisition by U.S. based SunGard. Political career In 2010 he turned back to Tunisia, just before the Tunisian Revolution would lead to his appointment as Minister of Transport and Equipment in the short-lived second Ghannouchi cabinet and the subsequent Essebsi cabinet. He resigned on 17 June 2011 to become general secretary of the newly founded Afek Tounes party which he led into a merger with Ahmed Najib Chebbi's Progressive Democratic Party, the Republican Party Al Joumhouri. On 28 August 2013, Brahim however announced the cession from the Republican Party reestablishing Afek Tounes as an independent liberal party. In the 2014 legislative election, Afek Tounes won 8 seats and Brahim himself was elected to represent the Mahdia constituency at the Assembly of the Representatives of the People. In February 2015, Afek Tounes agreed in a unity government with Nidaa Tounes and rival UPL. In prime minister Habib Essid's cabinet, he became Minister of Development, Investment and International Cooperation.

In the United States, freight broker surety bonds are required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to move property such as household goods or freight and motor cargo (vehicles). Their role is to guarantee that freight brokers and auto transport brokers will operate according to their agreements with shippers and motor carriers. If a freight broker or auto transport broker does not comply with their contract, the carrier or the shipper may file a claim. The three parties to the agreement are: * Principal: the freight broker / auto transport broker * Obligee: the party requiring the bond (FMCSA) * Surety: the surety company A freight broker bond is also known as a BMC-84 surety bond, trucking surety bond, transportation broker surety bond, or property broker bond. FMCSA uses the term \\"property broker\\" instead of freight broker. History This first freight broker bond requirement took into effect in the 1930. In the 1970s the bond amount was increased to $10,000 and was not changed until June 29, 2012 when the Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). The two main changes that came with the MAP-21 were: * the freight broker bond increase - from $10,000 to $75,000 * freight forwarders must now also meet the $75k requirement The freight broker bond increase took effect on October 1, 2013. Many freight brokers were against this change because they expected they wouldn't be able to meet the new requirement: it was a 7-fold increase, moreover the previous price was set constant for about 40 years. According to FMCSA there had been too many cases where shippers and carriers had been delayed (or entirely denied) payment so the bond increase was necessary. One of the strongest objections to the changes came from the Association of Independent Property Brokers & Agents (AIBPA). They claimed that this would create a loss of 8,200 freight brokerages, tens of thousands of jobs. Kevin Reid, who was CEO of The National Association for Minority Truckers (NAfMT) also came fourth to object. Saying it was an \\"unreasonable barrier to entry for would-be entrepreneurs.\\" Regardless of these objections and enraged freight brokers, the provisions had passed into law.

Her father was the heir of his brother the art connoisseur Payne Knight (d.1824), MP,History of Parliament biography who rebuilt Downton Castle in Shropshire. Career In 1817, aged just 16, Charlotte Knight was presented with the Silver Medal of the Horticultural Society of London (now the Royal Horticultural Society) in recognition of the quality of the Waterloo cherry. Her father, himself a noted botanist, had written in 1816 that the new variety \\"sprang from a seed of the Ambr√©e of Du Hamel and the pollen of the May-Duke\\".Thomas Andrew Knight, \\"Some account of three new cherries, the Elton, Black Eagle, and Waterloo\\" in Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London vol. 2 (1812‚Äì1817) pp. 208‚Äì211 It was named after the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place two years before in 1815, as it had fruited first at Elton Hall in Herefordshire a few days after Napoleon's defeat at that battle.See \\"Cherry Timeline\\" and \\"Cherry Varieties\\" in Cherry Ripe: a taste of Kent It ripens early, in late June to early July, and can serve as a pollinator to later varieties.

He was elected as Member of the European Parliament from Romania in 2014 and 2019. Education Siegfried Mure»ôan graduated from the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies in 2004. He also holds a Master's Degree in Economics and Management from Humboldt University. Early career In 2006, he was part of the International Scholarship Programme of the German Parliament (). Subsequently, he continued for three years as an Advisor to the Chairman of the Committee on European Affairs of the German Parliament, G√ºnther Krichbaum, and afterwards he worked briefly in the European Parliament. In 2011, he joined the Headquarters of the European People‚Äôs Party (EPP) as Political Advisor for Economics and Social Policy. In January 2014, he was promoted to Senior Political Advisor. Afterwards, in January 2015, he was appointed Political Spokesman of the EPP. Political career MEP Siegfried Mure»ôan in 2016. =First term as Member of the European Parliament= In March 2014, Mure»ôan joined the People's Movement Party (PMP), and took part in the European Parliament elections which were held on 25 May, 2014. He was the second candidate on the list and was elected for a five-year term in the European Parliament. Later on, Mure»ôan was elected as Vice- President of the Committee on Budgets, substitute member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and member of the Delegation to the EU - Moldova Parliamentary Association Committee. In July 2014, Mure»ôan was appointed President of the Youth of the PMP. On 22 Januaery 2015, the President of the European People‚Äôs Party, Joseph Daul, announced Mure»ôan as the newly appointed spokesman of EPP. On May 7, 2018, he joined the National Liberal Party, the largest member party of the EPP in Romania. The European Parliament approved Mure»ôan‚Äôs report on redundancies from C√¢mpia Turzii in September 2014, allocating EUR 3.57 million in European Globalisation Adjustment Fund that were needed in order to offer support to redundant workers from Mechel Steel Plant from C√¢mpia Turzii. In July 2015, the Parliament approved financial aid worth 66.5 million EUR in order to compensate the damage caused by the floods of 2014 in Romania, Italy and Bulgaria in response to a report coordinated by Mure»ôan. In 2016, Mure»ôan was appointed as main negotiator of the EPP Group for the 2017 EU Budget. On 24 November 2016, the Committee on Budgets designated Mure»ôan as the European Parliament‚Äôs rapporteur for the EU Budget 2018, the first Romanian to take on this role. From 8 to 12 December 2014, Mure»ôan organised a Moldovan art exhibition at the European Parliament in Brussels, entitled \\"Moldovan Art for Your Heart\\". Mure»ôan participated as a European Parliament representative at the 2016 World Bank-IMF annual meeting in Washington DC. He participated as an international observer in the Election Observation Mission of the European Parliament during the two rounds of the 2016 presidential election in Moldova. MEP and EPP Group Vice-President Siegfried Mure»ôan with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in 2019 at the EPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium. As Chief Negotiator of the European Parliament for the EU Budget 2018, one of Mure»ôan‚Äôs main priorities for the negotiations was the increase of the budget allocations for the Eastern Neighbourhood countries, including the Republic of Moldova. Mure»ôan criticized the measures taken by the Romanian Government and Romanian Parliament in 2017 and 2018 to amend judicial legislation. He took part in protests against the Romanian Government organised between January 2017 and February 2018 in Bucharest. On 7 February 2018, during the debate of the European Parliament on \\"Threats to the Rule of Law Caused by the Judicial Reform in Romania\\" Mure»ôan emphasized his support for the protesters, saying ‚Äúthe reality in Romania is as follows: there is a major discrepancy between what people want and what the ruling coalition wants. People want justice and rule of law. They want European values, while the politicians from the Government want to weaken state institutions and put justice under their control.‚Äù =Second term as Member of the European Parliament= On 24 September 2018, Siegfried Muresan, submitted to the National Liberal Party his application file as candidate for a new mandate in the European Parliament. In his application file, Mure»ôan defined as his most important objectives for the upcoming parliamentary term the protection of Romania's interests throughout his activity in the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament and the securing of the highest level of financial allocations for Romania. At the same time, he emphasized his commitment to obtain sufficient financial allocations from the EU Budget for ‚ÄûErasmus‚Äù scholarships and researchers, as well as for farmers and cohesion policy. MEP Mure»ôan also outlined his plans to actively take part in the debates on the future of the Eurozone, so that the decisions adopted at EU level would not affect in a negative way the economy of Romania. Moreover, he clearly committed to protecting the rights and interests of the non-euro area Member States that have expressed their will to join the euro. On 14 March 2019, the enlarged presidency of the National Liberal Party approved the list of candidates for the European Parliament elections taking place on 26 May 2019. MEP Siegfried Mure≈üan was placed on the third position on the National Liberal Party candidates‚Äô list. On 27 March 2019, the National Liberal Party officially submitted to the Central Electoral Bureau the list of candidates and the necessary support signatures for the European Parliament elections, taking place on 26 May 2019. Siegfried Mure≈üan thus became an official candidate for a new mandate in the European Parliament. The National Liberal Party won the elections of 26 May 2019 by obtaining 27% of the votes cast and Siegfried Mure»ôan was elected for a new term in the European Parliament. Shortly after the elections, on 5 June 2019, Siegfried Mure≈üan became Vice- Chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament (the largest political group of the European Parliament). Siegfried Mure»ôan was elected by 141 out of 158 votes cast. On 19 September 2019, the EPP Group in the European Parliament decided that Siegfried Mure»ôan, in his capacity as Vice-Chair of the EPP Group, will coordinate the Group‚Äôs activity in the areas relating to the EU budget, regional development, agriculture and budgetary control. On November 12 2019, Siegfried Mure»ôan was elected as Vice-President of the European People's Party. One of the main priorities during his mandate will be to advocate for EPP to be the European party that contributes decisively to strengthening Romania‚Äôs position as part of the European Union.

It is named for Harry Furstenberg, who introduced it in a series of papers beginning in 1963 (in the case of semisimple Lie groups). The Furstenberg boundary, roughly speaking, is a universal moduli space for the Poisson integral, expressing a harmonic function on a group in terms of its boundary values. Motivation A model for the Furstenberg boundary is the hyperbolic disc D={z : z<1}. The classical Poisson formula for a bounded harmonic function on the disc has the form :f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\hat{f}(e^{i\\\\theta}) P(z,e^{i\\\\theta})\\\\, d\\\\theta where P is the Poisson kernel. Any function f on the disc determines a function on the group of M√∂bius transformations of the disc by setting . Then the Poisson formula has the form : F(g) = \\\\int_{z=1}\\\\hat{f}(gz) \\\\, dm(z) where m is the Haar measure on the boundary. This function is then harmonic in the sense that it satisfies the mean-value property with respect to a measure on the M√∂bius group induced from the usual Lebesgue measure of the disc, suitably normalized. The association of a bounded harmonic function to an (essentially) bounded function on the boundary is one-to-one. Construction for semi-simple groups In general, let G be a semi-simple Lie group and Œº a probability measure on G that is absolutely continuous. A function f on G is Œº-harmonic if it satisfies the mean value property with respect to the measure Œº: :f(g) = \\\\int_G f(gg') \\\\, d\\\\mu(g') There is then a compact space Œ†, with a G action and measure ŒΩ, such that any bounded harmonic function on G is given by :f(g) = \\\\int_\\\\Pi \\\\hat{f}(gp) \\\\, d u(p) for some bounded function \\\\hat{f} on Œ†. The space Œ† and measure ŒΩ depend on the measure Œº (and so, what precisely constitutes a harmonic function). However, it turns out that although there are many possibilities for the measure ŒΩ (which always depends genuinely on Œº), there are only a finite number of spaces Œ† (up to isomorphism): these are homogeneous spaces of G that are quotients of G by some parabolic subgroup, which can be described completely in terms of root data and a given Iwasawa decomposition. Moreover, there is a maximal such space, with quotient maps going down to all of the other spaces, that is called the Furstenberg boundary.

It is now in the Mus√©e Cond√© in Chantilly.  History  The Assassination of the Duke of Guise par Paul Delaroche, 1834, Mus√©e Cond√© In 1834 Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans commissioned a painting from Ingres to act as a pendant to Paul Delaroche's 1834 The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (now also in the mus√©e Cond√©). That same year Ingres left for Rome to take up his post as director of the French Academy. This delayed work on the commission, which began with a c.1838 sketch (now in the Cleveland Museum of Art). According to Lady Egl√© Charlemont, she served as the model for Stratonice, Ingres' wife as the doctor, Hippolyte Flandrin for Antiochus' arms, and Ingres himself for Seleucus. The painting was completed in Rome in 1840, with help from assistants: Victor Baltard, then studying architecture at the Academy, provided drawings for two of Ingres' pupils, Paul and Raymond Balze, to use in painting part of the architectural setting.Condon 1983, p. 62. The Duke of Orl√©ans was satisfied with the work and paid Ingres 6000 francs and commissioned a portrait from him. The painting was exhibited in the gallery at the Palais-RoyalNicole Garnier-Pelle, p. 213-214 and was inherited by the Duke of Orl√©ans' widow H√©l√®ne de Mecklembourg-Schwerin on his death in 1842. After the 1848 Revolution, the painting was sold in Paris in 1852, when it was acquired by the Demidoff family for 63,000 francs. It was sold again in Paris in 1863, where it was bought for 93,000 francs by √âdouard Bocher, acting as intermediary for the Duke of Orl√©ans' brother the Duke of Aumale, then in exile in London. Aumale exhibited it in the Salle de Tribune of his Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, where it still is.Nicole Garnier-Pelle, p. 211  Description  The scene is one described in Plutarch's Life of Demetrius and also attested in the Bibliotheca historica of Diodorus Siculus, Lucian, Appian and Valerius Maximus. Antiochus was the son of Seleucus I Nicator. He fell in love with his father's new wife Stratonice of Syria, but kept this a secret despite falling mortally ill because of it. The doctor Erasistratus discovered the cause of Antiochus' sickness, since he became agitated and his heartbeat quickened when Stratonice entered the room. His father is thus shown collapsed at the foot of the bed.Nicole Garnier-Pelle, p. 213  Influences  Ingres' teacher Jacques- Louis David had also painted the subject, in Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease, the painting which won him the Prix de Rome in 1774. Ingres had made several drawings after David's painting, the earliest dating to 1807. Another source may have been music and opera, since a lyre is shown in the foreground. The Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse produced √âtienne-Nicolas M√©hul's opera Stratonice several times whilst Ingres was a violinist with them. The painting shows the moment of the heroine's solo from M√©hul's opera. The Assassination of the Duke of Guise was also based on an opera, Giacomo Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.Nicole Garnier-Pelle, p. 214-215 The decor and dress are partly inspired by ancient models, with Stratonice in particular, very closely influenced by Roman sculpture. The bed is inspired by a 4th-century BC naiskos or funerary monument shown on a vase discovered at Canosa and published in 1816.Analysis of the work on the CRDP site, p. 2  Sketches and copies  Ingres produced at least four other versions of this subject:Nicole Garnier-Pelle, p. 212-213 * a large sketch, painted between 1807 and 1825. His pupil Amaury-Duval saw the painting in his master's studio at that date. It disappeared after the sale of Ingres' studio in 1867.

Biography He was born in Rome, the son of Joseph Balze (1781‚Äì1847), grand chamberlain to Charles IV of Spain during the latter's exile in Rome between 1811 and 1819. His brother Raymond Balze was also an artist. During his stay in Rome, Joseph Balze met the painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and commissioned several works from him after 1814. Paul entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris at the start of the 1830s, becoming copyist to the Louvre Museum. By now Ingres was director of the French Academy in Rome, from which he requested that Paul and Raymond be sent to copy the 1519 Vatican loggias by Raphael. These 52 copies were exhibited in 1840 in the chapel of the √©cole des beaux-arts in Paris. In 1843, to reply to a request by Ingres to find a \\"home as a monument\\", F√©lix Duban proposed placing them on the first floor galleries in the Palais des √âtudes. These copies were placed in the gallery vaults between 1854 and 1855 by the decorative painters Charles Chauvin and Camille-Auguste Gastine. Paul Balze produced several other Raphael reproductions in faience and also took part in the decorative scheme of the H√¥tel de la Banque de France in Paris. In 1855 he and Raymond made a copy of Ingres' The Apotheosis of Homer for one of the stairways in the Louvre. Between 1875 and 1881 the pair restored the Francesco Primaticcio frescoes in the abbot's chapel in Chaalis Abbey. Paul Balze died in Paris on 24 March 1884.

It lies just west of Knockbrack and the small massif of Benbrack, and looks into the Polladirk valley, around which several major Bens are located. Despite its moderate size and isolated position, Diamond Hill is a popular peak with tourists due to its paths and boarded mountain trail, and relative ease of access, together with well-regarded views of the core Twelve Bens range, and western Connemara. Naming According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, \\"Ghuaire\\" most likely refers to Guaire Aidne mac Colm√°in (died 663), one of the Kings of Connacht and a member of the Ui Fiachrach Aidhne. Guaire was renowned for his hospitality and generosity and was known as \\"Guaire of the extended hand\\", and is the title character in W.B. Yeats‚Äô play, The King‚Äôs Threshold. He is also associated with Dunguaire Castle, near the village of Kinvara. Tempan also notes that Diamond Hill is also known as \\"Bengooria\\", being an anglicised version of its Irish name, as well as \\"Benhoowirra\\", an alterative anglicisation. The Discovery Map spells the name as \\"Diomond Hill\\", however, Tempan notes that this is not the locally accepted spelling (being \\"Diamond\\"), and relates to the glitter of the quartz crystals on the mountain.  Geography  Diamond Hill is an isolated peak of the Twelve Bens, which lies in the north-west corner of the range. Immediately east of Diamond Hill is the minor peak of Knockbrack at , which is part of the small massif of Benbrack , one of the core Twelve Bens. To the north of Diamond Hill is Kylemore Lough (and Kylemore Abbey), and across the Lough is the massif of Garraun, which is part of the wider Twelve Bens/Garraun Complex Special Area of Conservation. To the west of Diamond Hill is the Ballinakill harbour (and weather permitting, views to the isles of Inishboffin and Inishark), and to the south are the western boglands and dotted lakes of Connemara. To the southeast is the scenic valley of Polladirk, around which several major Bens are located, including Benbrack, Benfree (and Benbaun at , the tallest Ben in the range just behind Benfree), Muckanaght , and Bencullagh .  Hill walking  Diamond Hill is popular for its accessibility and panoramic views, only ranking behind Croagh Patrick for footfall, and attracts both Irish walkers and foreign tourists. The mountain was closed to climbing in 2002 due to severe erosion but was re- opened in December 2005 after the completion of a Euro 1.4 million wooden boardwalk and stone path trail that would limit further erosion. The most popular route is the 7-kilometre 2.5-hour round-trip trail that starts and ends at the National Park visitor centre in Letterfrack, and does a loop over the summit ridge and back to the main trail; it does not require any special hiking ability and the trail is well marked, with pathways and boardwalks over bog sections. The trail splits into a Lower Diamond Hill Walk (3 km long loop), and an Upper Diamond Hill Walk (3.7 km long loop) which reaches the summit.

The term literally translates into English as \\"Taiwan Business.\\" There are no official statistics on the number of Taishang working in mainland China. Unofficial estimates circulating in 2011 suggested that between 1 million and 3 million Republic of China nationals (including family members) lived in mainland China. Economic impact Taiwan Approved Investments in Mainland China by Cases Accumulation from 1991 to 2014 The more Taiwanese capital is invested in the mainland, the more it becomes part and parcel of China's growing economy. Therefore, the taishang are a major force in the economic integration of China with the larger world-economy. After the economic reform escalated, China has attracted a huge amount of direct investments from Taiwan and concomitantly a large number of Taiwanese entrepreneurs, managers, and professionals moved to China. China has replaced the US as Taiwan's top importer in 2003. The change of government in Taiwan in May 2008 and the economic crisis that took hold of coastal China in late 2008 and continued throughout 2009, forced many factories in Taiwan to close down or relocate to other countries. This led to a large increase in the number of taishang in Mainland China. As of the end of 2008, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) reported Taiwanese direct investment (TDI) in China to be US$47.7 billion; Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Investment Commission (hereafter, Investment Commission) announced a total investment value of US$75.6 billion; Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) estimated the amount at between US$100 billion and US$150 billion; many private sectors in Taiwan estimated the amount to be between US$100 billion and US$200 billion. Political impact Collectively the taishang are seen as an important group in Taiwanese politics and are widely perceived to be supportive of deeper economic integration between Taiwan and mainland China. Taishang as a group are widely assumed to support Taiwan's pro-Chinese-Nationalist KMT party. The taishang ·ªèganization, (ATIEM), organizes flights to Taiwan for taishang to vote in Taiwanese elections. In reality, research shows that most taishang are not very interested in Chinese media journalism or television programmes. This is because the perception of being superior to the PRC Chinese discourages them from becoming involved in Chinese society and politics.

Maria Nilsdotter was the daughter of the farmer Nils Larsson and Kierstin Nilsdotter i √ñlmskog and married Jan Nilsson in 1781; she was the heir of her parents and took over the farm √ñlmskog with her spouse from her parents. After the death of Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden on 28 My 1810, rumors circulated through the nation that he had been poisoned by the Gustavians, and created great tension. In the capital of Stockholm, Axel von Fersen the Younger was lynched in June because of these rumors (Fersen murder). In V√§rmland, an anonymous proclamation circulated which called men to arm themselves and march as an army to the capital to protect the monarch, who was claimed to be in danger. By the time they reached the farm of Maria Nilsdotter, they were about 40, but still growing in numbers, and asked for her three sons and male servants to join them. She demanded to know who had issued the proclamation. When told that it was in fact not issued by the authorities but from an anonymous and unknown source, she forbid her sons to join them. She thereafter held a speech to the assembled armed men, which convinced them to dissolve the improvised army and discontinue the formatting of it. She thereby prevented what could have been the start of a dangerous rebellion. On 8 October 1810, Maria Nilsdotter was awarded a chain with a medal of gold and a Gilding silver coup with the inscription: \\"By King Carl XIII to Goodwife Maria Nilsdotter i √ñlmeskog, for virtue in citizenry\\".Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta; Klercker Cecilia af (1942).

A solo artist, he became lead singer for the Ethiopian group Zemen Band. He released his debut solo album Mixology in 2012. He was part of the pan-Armenian music formation Genealogy who represented Armenia in Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song \\"Face the Shadow\\" finishing 16th overall. Biography Vahe Tilbian is an Ethiopian- Armenian artist. Vahe is known for his style ‚Äì from rock to techno, reggae to R&B;, Armenian to Ethiopian and a lot of Latin Music. Vahe was born and raised in Ethiopia. Both his parents (Garo Tilbian and Ani Aslanian) are of Armenian origin. His paternal grandfather escaped the Armenian Genocide in 1923 and by way of Syria eventually settled in Ethiopia. His mother's side of the family all left the ancient lands of Western Armenia by the late 1890s or early 1900s. Vahe values his Armenian roots and believes that it was the cruel history of Armenia that built his unique artistic character. Vahe heard the call of the stage as a singer later in life after he graduated from University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada studying Biology and earning a BSc degree in General Science. Vahe has always been involved in dancing and became a professional International Style Latin American ballroom dancer. He was the co-creator and choreographer of the Salsegnochu Dance Group. Around this time, Vahe was singing as a lead tenor in a choir in Addis Ababa called The Motley Singers. After working in the business sector for over 3 years as a young college graduate, Vahe left his job in 2008 and started working on music full- time. He joined the band Z Beyaynetus with the support of his friend Bitik Emlaelu and Ledj Leo. Soon, Kenny Allen, performer and producer from DC residing in Ethiopia, heard him at one of the local bars and asked to sing supporting vocals (backing vocals) for his album release show with the 251 Band. He agreed and became his permanent supporting vocalist and worked together around town and on local music festival stages for many years. Thereafter, Vahe decided to diversify his genre and repertoire joining a salsa band called Eshee Havana and worked on original remixes of Ethiopian songs into salsa music. In 2011, he made the final auditions to the Big Brother Africa show. Vahe wrote the lyrics to his first song called \\"Life or Something Like it\\" and Michael Hailu put the melody together and they recorded it in 2010. This gave him the enthusiasm and courage to write more lyrics and create songs. Vahe's single \\"Don‚Äôt Stop\\" was nominated for an Armenian Pulse Music Award for the best song in English by an Armenian artist in 2012. The song won the 3rd place by online voting. In November 2012 Vahe finished his album titled Mixology, and released it for free. In May 2013, Vahe released a music video for the song \\"Yene Tizita\\", meaning nostalgia or memories, directed and produced by Aramazt Kalayjian and Mulugeta Amaru. This was a new rendition of the old Ethiopian song form. Vahe was the lead vocalist for Zemen Band for 2 years. He worked with well-established Ethiopian singers such as Zeritu Kebede, Michael Belayneh and the musical group known as Nubian Arc Band. Vahe was also the back-up vocalist as well as the opening act for artists like Ledj Leo, Abby Lakew, Nhatty, Tsedenya Gebremarkos, Eyob Mekonnen, Shewandagn Hailu. He also performed as a back-up vocalist for visiting artists from other African countries like Zimbabwean artist Oliver Mtukudzi, and Kenyan artists Vee and Liz Ogumbo. In addition to his career as an artist, Vahe has been a columnist at Zoma magazine published in Addis Ababa. In February 2015 Vahe was announced as a member of the Armenian music group Genealogy. Along with other members of the group he represented Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015.

Life He was born in Rome, the son of Joseph Balze (1781‚Äì1847), grand chamberlain to Charles IV of Spain during the latter's exile in Rome between 1811 and 1819. His elder brother Paul Balze was also active as an artist. During his stay in Rome, Joseph Balze met the painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and commissioned several works from him after 1814. Raymond entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris on 6 October 1832, becoming copyist to the Louvre Museum. By now Ingres was director of the French Academy in Rome, from which he requested that Paul and Raymond be sent to copy the 1519 Vatican loggias by Raphael. These 52 copies were exhibited in 1840 in the chapel of the √©cole des beaux-arts in Paris. In 1843, to reply to a request by Ingres to find a \\"monumental home\\", F√©lix Duban proposed placing them on the first floor galleries in the Palais des √âtudes. These copies were placed in the gallery vaults between 1854 and 1855 by the decorative painters Charles Chauvin and Camille-Auguste Gastine. The brothers' other collaborations included the 1855 copy of Ingres' The Apotheosis of Homer for one of the stairways in the Louvre, the 1875‚Äì1881 restoration of the Francesco Primaticcio frescoes in the abbot's chapel in Chaalis Abbey, and the 1891 design for a mosaic after Raphael showing The Vision of Ezekiel for the facade of Saint-Jacques de Montauban church in Montauban. Raymond was also attached to the Mauvernay stained-glass studio at Saint-Galmier (Loire). He took part in the 1848 competition and was made a first level laureate. He was commissioned to take part in the decoration of the H√¥tel de ville de Paris by Ingres. He also produced religious works, such as The Charity of Saint Elisabeth of Hungary (1866, mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon) and The Martyrdom of Saint Catherine (1866, √©glise sainte Catherine, Lille).

They had two children: *Emmanuel Bocher (1835-1919), officer, writer, pianist, painter, editor of the complete works of Gavarni and great friend of Sarah Bernhardt *Valentin Bocher (1840-1849) In 1839 √âdouard Bocher was made prefect for Gers, then in 1841 for Toulouse and in 1842 for Caen. In 1848 he stopped being prefect for Calvados and in 1849 he became deputy for that department, sitting on the right. He protested against the 1851 coup. Opposed to the Second French Empire, he and others were put in charge of dealing with the property of Louis-Philippe I and his family. In 1871 he was elected to represent Calvados, sitting in the centre-right group, of which he became president. He was senator for Calvados from 1876 to 1894, sitting on the right. A great book collector, he assembled a remarkable collection of rare books. He was a close friend of Alfred de Musset, who dedicated one of his first poems to him.

Introduction  State social protection system of Armenia is financed by the state budget. The services provided within this institution are free for citizens. Ministry Labour and Social Affairs coordinates the services provision process.  Social protection system during the First Republic of Armenia  The Ministry of Public Assistance was established in November 1918, at the time when the second Government of the First Republic of Armenia was reorganizing. On April 8, 1919 it was renamed ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Labor and Public Assistance‚Äù. Until July 5, 1919 the Ministry of Food used to organize food purchasing and distributing works. But, on July 5, 1919 the Ministry of Food being dissolved, its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Labor and Public Assistance. On January 8, 1920 the Ministry was renamed ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Reconstruction and Public Assistance‚Äù. It comprised the Orphanage, Migration, Labor Organization, Medical and Sanitary, Labor Protection, Architecture and Construction Departments. 1918‚Äì1920 were particularly hard times; the First World War, the Genocide of 1915 and lasting wars with the Turks had left behind hundreds of thousands of refugees. Finally, the Armenian people gained the independence they had been dreaming of for ages. The First Republic of Armenia was established, ready to move on and withstand all difficulties. Despite all these hardships, the Ministry of Reconstruction and Public Assistance had representatives both in Georgia and Azerbaijan, making allocations to fulfill the basic needs of the Armenians, living in Georgia and Azerbaijan. One Minister often headed up more than one Ministry at the time since there were problems within the Republic, as well as urgent issues related to borders‚Äô defense, weapon acquisition and foreign relations. In general, the Ministers of those times were literate and highly educated national leaders.  Social protection system during the Second Republic of Armenia  When Armenia became part of the Soviet Union, Bolshevik leaders came to replace those Ministers. They were conceptualized and highly educated national leaders, who afterwards got high-ranking positions but were fusilladed in 1937. On December 8, 1920 the Ministry was organized as the Commissariat of Reconstruction and Care. Later, on December 21 it was renamed ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Commissariat for Social Security‚Äù. On March 12, 1925 it was again renamed and this time bore the name of ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Commissariat of Labor and Social Security‚Äù. In 1946, the Ministry for Social Security of the ASSR (Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic) was once again reorganized. The Ministry consisted of the Pensions and Benefits Department, Job Placement and Household Management, Supervising, Controlling, Medical-Working Expertise, Financial, Planning, Capital Construction and Administrative Departments, Central Accountancy and Individual Pensioners‚Äô Inspectorate. The Ministry headed the Departments responsible for Pensions and Benefits Calculation and Payout, as well as Republic Centers of Information and Computing, Boarding Houses for the disabled, the elderly and children, the Experimental-Industrial Enterprise of Prosthetics and Orthopedics, and the Clinic of Prosthetics and Medical-Working Expertise, the Committees of Republic, Regional and District Medical-Working Expertise, the Deaf and Dump Associations, the Social Security Departments of the Regional and City Soviets of the People's Deputies.  Armenia's social protection system after 1990  In 1990, in the post-Soviet period, the RA Ministry for Social Security was reorganized into the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. After the parliamentary elections of 1995, according to the Presidential Decree, the Government structure underwent changes; the Ministry was reorganized into the Ministry of Social Security, Employment, Migration and Refugee Affairs. In 1996, according to the Presidential Decree, the Government underwent new structural changes. On November 8, 1996 the Ministry was reorganized into the Ministry of Social Security. On February 28, 2000 according to the RA President's Decree, the Ministry was merged into the Ministry of Health and Social Security. On May 20, 2000 according to the RA President's Decree, the Ministry was separated as the RA Ministry of Social Security. On December 25, 2003 pursuant to the RA President's Decree, it was renamed the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The first years of these transitional period were incredibly hard ones for the Armenian people. The consequences of the earthquake of 1988 ( it had destroyed the third of the country's territory and killed about 25 thousands of people) were still vivid, let alone the blockade, the immigration of the displaced persons (DP), the energy crisis, unemployment and so on. In 1992, it was officially announced that the poverty rate in the Republic reached 94%. It meant that people were desperate, and the country which had just gained independence could not overcome the socio-economic difficulties all alone. The RA Government was implementing economic reforms at the time, the Legislative Field was in the formation process. Humanitarian aid was of primary importance. The RA President assigned the RA Government to set up a system that would organize the works on addressed distributions of the humanitarian aid. A working group of relevant specialists was formed, a clear set of regulations elaborated, and the ‚ÄúParos‚Äù system realized. In order to make this system operate, there was formed the Social Services‚Äô Institute within the Ministry of Social Security. It had its own territorial offices contributing to the ‚ÄúParos‚Äù system implementation. The latter came to distinctly specify the poverty rate among needy families as well as regulate the operative and unbiased distribution of the provided humanitarian aid. Social Services were funded from the State budget. Beneficiary services were provided free of charge. The RA Ministry of Labor and Social Security was in charge of the coordination of those social services, as well as conducted the unified policy, carried out the methodological and organizational assistance.

V-56 Quadrangle bordered by the black dashed lines. The Quetzalpetlatl Corona is outlined in red and the inner Boala Corona in yellow. Background image provided by NASA/JPL.Lada Terra is a major landmass near the south pole of Venus which is centered at 60¬∞S and 20¬∞E and has a diameter of . It is defined by the International Astronomical Union as one of the three \\"major landmasses,\\" or terrae, of Venus. The term \\"landmass\\" is not analogous to the landmass on Earth, as there are no apparent oceans on Venus. The term here applies to a substantial portion of land that lies above the average planetary radius, and corresponds to highlands. The broad region of Lada Terra contains massive coronae, rift zones, and volcanic plains as well as many other features that scientists use to attempt to piece together the history of this complex planet. The distinctive cross-cutting relationships found in the bedding of Lada Terra have been important in realizing relative ages of the extensional belts and coronae, as well as the complex tesserae features present planet-wide. In 1990 the Venus Radar Mapper revealed the largest outflow channel system on the planet located in the northern region of Lada Terra. Although Lada Terra is generally considered a highland of Venus, the topography is much lower-lying than its northern counterparts Ishtar Terra and Aphrodite Terra. Lada Terra is named after Lada, the Slavic goddess of love. Features Expanded view of Lada Terra. Black dashed line bounds Lada Terra while the white encloses Lavinia Planitia. The Quetzalpetlatl Corona is in red and the Boala Corona in yellow. The Alpha-Lada belt is depicted as the jagged light blue line. Background image courtesy of NASA/JPL. Lada Terra is one of eight distinct regions on the surface of Venus. Ishtar Terra and Aphrodite Terra are the other significant terrae of the planet, located near the northern polar region and the equator, respectively. Lada Terra has a diameter of . and covers most of the south pole region on Venus. The region consists of heavily deformed terrains indicating crustal deformation processes affecting the area in the past. The lowlands are much smoother terrain with very little deformation, which scientists postulate to be relatively young lava flow remnants. The most prominent region is the midlands, where gently sloping topography is disrupted by faults, fractures, and corona, making this area the most complex and studied region in Lada Terra. =Lada Rise= The western portion of Lada Terra contains a large dome-shaped structure about across termed, \\"the Lada Rise,\\" which is the main highland of the region. It reaches an elevation of about and is dominated by one of the most massive corona in the solar system, the Quetzalpetlatl Corona, as well as two massive rift zones surround and partially intersect the rise. The high rises of Venus generally fall into the corona-dominated or rift- dominated categories, but the Lada Rise is unique in that it contains both of these features in relatively equal amounts. In 2007, data retrieved from the Venus Express mission using the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer revealed high emissivity anomalies which is interpreted by many scientists to be a hotspot analogous to the Hawaii hot spot on Earth. This, along with the positive gravity anomaly observed, implies a recently active region. Further evidence is observed in the Boala Corona (which lies inside, and postdates the Quetzalpetlatl Corona), where the grabens formed in the depression of the Corona are interpreted to be surface manifestations of terrestrial dikes. The mantle upwelling associated with hot spot tectonism appears to be the dominant process which formed and evolved the Lada Rise. Alpha-Lada Extensional Belt A rift about long and wide, named the Alpha-Lada extensional belt, spans the northwestern edge of Lada Terra separating the relatively high lands of Lada Terra from the broad lowlands of Lavinia Planitia. The Lavinia Planitia basin is suspected to be an area of mantle downwelling, where there are less thermal stresses on the lithosphere. Because the nearby Lada Rise is speculated to be an area of mantle upwelling, models predict this could create a zone of weakness between these two convection cells which stretches the lithosphere, thus creating the rift zone. Associated with the rift zone are large lava flow fields and corona. The bedding relationships between the rift zone and these volcanic structures indicate they were formed about the same time, which many interpret as lava finding a preferential route to the surface through these newly formed fractures. Ammavuro-Quetzalpetlatl Extensional Belt A second rift, named the Ammavuro-Quetzalpetlatl extensional belt, is a long and wide rift which lies in the northeast region of Lada Terra. These two massive rifts intersect in the northern region of Lada Terra, and the observed deformation of the two extensional belts seems to have occurred at the same time, although the larger Alpha-Lada rift most likely continued to be deformed for a longer period. =Quetzalpetlatl Corona= Unlike most coronae on the planet, which are about in diameter, Quetzalpetlatl Corona has a diameter of about . It is the third most massive corona after Artemis Corona and Heng-O Corona, and lies on the Lada Rise, with part of the corona intersecting the Ammavuro- Quetzalpetlatl belt in the northwestern region of Lada Terra. The corona consists of a raised inner region surrounded by the lower-lying \\"corona floor,\\" with an elevated ridge about above the corona floor, as well as an outer \\"moat\\" of depressed terrain which is below the surrounding land. The corona is characterized by massive lava flows that cover almost of the Venusian surface, the largest lava flow extent seen on the planet to date. We can draw an analogue of this lava flow to a flow that occurred on earth, the Deccan Traps igneous province in India. Compared to other corona on Venus, Quetzalpetlatl Corona not only exhibits the most massive lava flow, but is also composed of lava of relatively homogeneous composition as revealed by the variations in brightness using radar backscatter imaging. This is in contrast with most coronae on Venus, which exhibit lava flows of a more heterogeneous nature. The latter are interpreted as lava flows originating from very distinct source(s). Boala Corona Quetzalpetlatl Corona contains within itself a younger, smaller corona named Boala Corona, which is situated at the summit of Lada Rise and is speculated to have contributed partly to the vast extent of Quetzalpetlatl Corona's massive lava flows. This corona is much different than its surrounding companion, with the smaller of the two featuring a shallow depression surrounded by a gently sloping ridge (the opposite of Quetzalpetlatl Corona). The lava flows produced by the shield volcanoes at its base, as well as most flows observed on Venus to date, seem to preferentially produce pahoehoe-type flows, and the reasons behind this are still unclear. Outflow channels on Lada Terra, outlined in red with youngest flow extent depicted as the yellow dashed lines. The channel is about 20 kilometers wide. Lada Terra, southern hemisphere of Venus. Background image provided by NASA/JPL Stratigraphic relationships Using crater counting methods scientists have dated the surface of Venus to be between 300-800 million years old. This is very young when compared to a region on earth located in Canada where there are 4 billion year old rock outcrops. This, coupled with the unique and complex lava flows and corona, make relative age dating very difficult for scientists. However, using cross cutting relationships obtained from the radar data received from the missions to Venus has allowed scientists to draw complex correlations. The unique tessera terrain, which is interpreted to be a deformation product of the high regional stresses on Venus, is the oldest type of terrain found in the Lada Terra Region. The extensional belts and several corona, including the Quetzalpetlatl Corona, are observed to be cutting across the tessera terrain, implying these structures to be formed after this heavily deformed material. The extensional belts in some areas cross cut the corona whereas the corona embay the extensional belts in other areas, implying a coevolution of the two. As a result, shield volcanoes formed around the corona and began intense episodic volcanism, with the flows from these events now covering 48% of the Lada Terra region. These massive lava flows along with the suspected adjacent mantle upwelling slowly built and uplifted the Lada Rise some time after the initial formation of the Quetzalpetlatl Corona. This is indicated by the Quetzalpetlatl corona being offset with respect to the summit of the Lada Rise, or in other words, the corona is tilted at a different angle relative to the summit, implying the rock was tilted by the formation of the rise. Volcanism due to the formation of the Boala Corona (with its deposits cross cutting the previously mentioned structures) form the youngest lava flows observed and represents the latest episode of the evolution of the Lada Rise.

It shows the death of Saint Symphorian, the first Christian martyr in Gaul. Painted in oil on canvas and measuring 407 x 339 cm, it is now in Autun Cathedral. Although Ingres considered the painting‚Äîcompleted only after ten years of diligent work‚Äîone of his crowning achievements, it was criticized harshly when he exhibited it in the Paris Salon of 1834. It subsequently has been considered emblematic of Ingres' misguided ambition to excel as a history painter. Background Frustrated during the early part of his career by the need to paint portraits to earn a living, Ingres was determined to make his reputation in the more prestigious genre of history painting, which he considered to be his true calling. His ambition was fulfilled when his The Vow of Louis XIII achieved a triumphant success at the Salon of 1824. The painting's calm classicism‚Äîwhich testified to Ingres' close study of Raphael and other old masters‚Äîpresented a challenge to the rising popularity of the romantic style exemplified by Eug√®ne Delacroix. The critics came to regard Ingres as the standard-bearer of classicism against the romantic schoolSiegfried & Rifkin 2001, p. 78‚Äì81.‚Äîa role he relished. Honors came his way; in January 1825 he was awarded the Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur by Charles X, and in June 1825 he was elected to the Institute. During the period from 1824 to 1834 he painted few portraits, and concentrated on history painting.Mongan and Naef 1967, p. xxi. He received several important commissions for such works, such as the monumental The Apotheosis of Homer, commissioned in 1826. Commission Studies for the Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian, oil on canvas, Mus√©e IngresThe Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian was commissioned in December 1824 by the bishop of Autun, Monsignor de Vichy.Arikha 1986, p. 73; Mongan and Naef 1967, notes for catalogue no. 60. It was intended to replace an altarpiece by Fra Bartolomeo (The Marriage of Saint Catherine; 1511) that had been confiscated to Paris during the Revolution. The subject of Ingres' painting was a youth who was beheaded ca. 160‚Äì179 by for refusing to worship a pagan idol. Monsignor de Vichy gave Ingres a detailed program to follow in composing his picture, which Ingres followed closely. The painting depicts the Roman proconsul Heraclius and his guards seizing Saint Symphorian and ordering him to prostrate himself in the temple of the pagan goddess Cybele, or be killed. The saint's mother, overlooking the scene from the city wall above, urges him to have faith and face death gladly. He gives her a heartening look. Ingres began work on the project with the hope of finishing the painting in time to exhibit it in the Salon of 1827, but the work proceeded slowly.Mongan and Naef 1967, notes for catalogue no. 60. He prepared the composition in all its details with his usual care, ultimately producing more than 200 preparatory drawings and at least eleven studies in oils. He had not yet resolved the composition by the time of the July Revolution of 1830. Unsettled by the revolution, Ingres abandoned work on the project for a time, but by 1833 had returned to it with renewed vigor.Cohn and Siegfried 1980, p. 108. The art historian Susan L. Siegfried contrasts the figure studies datable before 1830 with those made after the July Revolution, such as the two oil studies in the Fogg Art Museum (1833), in which \\"Ingres incorporated all of the passion of his own reaction to the social upheaval\\" and gave emphasis to \\"the energy of the mob, painting a moral lesson for the public he abhorred\\".Cohn and Siegfried 1980, p. 109. In addition to numerous drawings from live models, Ingres' research for the painting included much study of Renaissance and Baroque masters (Ingres spoke of \\"devouring Michelangelo\\").Cohn and Siegfried 1980, p. 94. He traveled to Autun in 1826 to examine the remnants of the city wall.Ingres et al. 1979, p. 41. He had wooden models made of the accessories held or worn by the figures, and painted from them.Arikha 1986, p. 73. The painting was completed in time for the March 1 opening date of the 1834 Salon. Reception Ingres wished to present The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian as his masterpiece and as the result of wide research, but it was a critical failure when it was exhibited at the Salon. Ingres' friends and admirers had only faint praise for it, while his detractors harshly criticized the congested composition and anatomical exaggerations. The critic Gabriel Laviron wrote that \\"many figures would gain by being cut out and separately framed\\", while Armand-Denis Vergnaud deplored the \\"muscles seen through a magnifying glass, strained, inflated out of place and proportion to the bodies and limbs on which they are nailed\\". When the length of the arms of the saint's mother was criticized, Ingres indignantly replied that \\"the arms of a mother who blesses her son marching to death are never too long.\\" The cool reception given his painting was made all the more galling by the critical success at the same Salon of Delacroix and Paul Delaroche, who displayed \\"large-scale figure pieces of less than the most elevated subjects\\", in the words of Marjorie Cohn.Condon et al. 1980, p. 18. Ingres' irritation may have been further exacerbated by the hanging of his work below a painting depicting \\"four or five life-sized cows returning to their stable\\". The result was that Ingres resolved never again to exhibit at the Salon or to accept any public commissions. He applied for and received a position as director of the French Academy in Rome, and left Paris in December 1834 to begin a self-imposed exile in Italy.Tinterow et al. 1999, p. 550. He did not return to France until 1841. In November 1834 The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian was installed in Autun Cathedral. Legacy Although Ingres remained firm in his belief that The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian was one of his supreme achievements, it has traditionally been counted among his least successful works. In 1889 Paul Mantz declared the painting \\"confused, emotionless and devoid of light. The future will be astonished at the excessive interest that our fathers attached to this composition, a work of ill digested Italianism.\\"Bann, Stephen (2013). Ways Around Modernism. Routledge. p. 86. . In 1950 Jean Alazard said: \\"To tell the truth, the painting is not worth more than the magnificent execution of its parts\\". The French art critic Pierre Schneider wrote in 1969 that the painting was \\"absurd\\" and exemplified \\"Ingres' phenomenal misjudgment of his capacities: those of a miniaturist haunted by heroic formats\\".Newman, Barnett, John Philip O'Neill, and Mollie McNickle. (1992). Barnett Newman: Selected Writings and Interviews. Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 297‚Äì298. . More appreciative was Avigdor Arikha, who said \\"there is a marvelous contrast between the static architecture and the swarming movements of the people in the foreground that makes us think of Bronzino.\\" In contrast to the critical judgment of the painting, the many preparatory drawings and oil studies associated with the painting are highly regarded. When the oil studies were displayed publicly for the first time at a memorial exhibition in 1867, they greatly impressed Gautier, who said \\"one stands stupified before these ... masterpieces\\", which reminded him of Greek antique fragments he had seen in Athens. Of the chalk drawing Three Men on Horseback (Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art), Agnes Mongan and Hans Naef wrote: \\"Probably the artist worked on the painting too long and too hard, for the finished work has none of the impact, freedom and majestic poise of these figures, and no echo of the brilliant light which plays on them.\\"Mongan and Naef 1967, notes for catalogue no. 61.

The cottages were built between 1900 and 1912 as part of the Mount Kineo resort complex, one of interior Maine's most successful summer resorts of the early 20th century, and are its only major surviving component. The cottages were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Setting and history Moosehead Lake is the largest lake in New England, stretching north for from Greenville, Maine. About halfway up the lake stands Mount Kineo, which stands on a peninsula jutting west into the lake and rises above it. A flat neck of land extends southward from the mountain, on which the Mount Kineo Resort was developed beginning in the 1880s. The resort included a large hotel (which burned down in the 1930s) built in 1884, a golf course, and the nearby Breakwater sporting lodge. In 1901 the resort management embarked on a campaign to build new \\"cottages\\" for lease to wealthy clients, hiring the architectural firm of Coombs and Gibbs for the purpose. The cottages were part of the resort's heyday years between 1910 and the 1930s, and of a revival period between 1947 and 1970. They were part of efforts later in the 20th century to restart the resort on a smaller scale. The seven cottages were sold entirely into private hands as part of a condominium association in 1989. The cottages are situated in a row on the western shore of the peninsula. They all share architectural characteristics with each other, and with the main hotel building. Predominantly Shingle style in design, these buildings included corner towers typical of the Queen Anne style, hanging bay windows over concave shingled bases, and leaded glass windows. All have expansive verandas, and have a main entrance facing south, toward where the hotel stood. Most of the cottages share basic floor plan and layout with at least one other in the group, to the point where the Birch Cottage is a near duplicate of Fir Cottage. They are described below in order, from north to south, using names given to them in 1970, when the cottage property was subdivided from the rest of the resort. =Fir Cottage= Fir Cottage was built in 1901, and its design is unambiguously attributable to Coombs and Gibbs. Because of its position at the far north of the row on a sloping lot, it stands higher than the other cottages. =Elm Cottage= Elm Cottage was built in 1905 and altered in 1912. Originally L-shaped in plan, its tower was added in 1912, and the crook of the L was enclosed. Unlike most of the other cottages, it is predominantly finished in clapboards instead of shingles. =Dogwood Cottage= Dogwood Cottage, built sometime between 1901 and 1904, is essentially Dutch Colonial Revival in design, with a shingled exterior and Shingle style details. It has an engaged porch (giving the second floor more square footage), with turned posts and balusters in the Queen Anne style. =Cedar Cottage= Cedar Cottage is similar in its exterior styling to Dogwood, as a Dutch Colonial with Shingle features, with an interior layout that is nearly identical to that of Fir Cottage. It may have been designed by Coombs and Gibbs, or merely been an built on altered plans. =Oak Lodge= Oak Lodge, built in 1912 on the site of a former sporting clubhouse, was the last of the seven to be built, and is the only one designed as a duplex. Built at the same that an annex was built onto the main hotel, it has a distinct Craftsman flavor to its design, with ribbon windows and exposed rafter tails. The building's two units are mirror images, and have been at times combined into a single unit. =Birch Cottage= Built between 1905 and 1907, this building is a near replica of Fir Cottage, differing only in some details on the tower. Its interior has been altered to expose the interior truss system from which its second floor is suspended, enabling it to have a large living room without posts. =Alpen Cottage= Alpen Cottage was built in 1904, and may also be a Coombs and Gibbs design. It has a gambrel roof, and its porch is partially exterior and partially engaged, with Tuscan columns supporting the overhanging second story on that portion.

It shows a vow to the Virgin Mary by Louis XIII of France. It is an oil painting on canvas measuring 421 x 262 cm. It was commissioned by France's Ministry of Interior in August 1820 for the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Montauban.Tinterow and Conisbee 1999, p. 548.Rosenblum 1986, p. 126. The subject of the painting was to be Louis XIII's vow in 1638 to consecrate his kingdom to the Virgin in Her Assumption.Arikha 1986, pp. 55‚Äì56. When Ingres accepted the commission, he was living in Florence. Although he had experienced success as a portrait painter, his ambition was to establish a reputation in the more prestigious genre of history painting. He went to work with his usual diligence, and spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion. He travelled to Paris with it in October 1824. It was a critical success at that year's Salon and later established Ingres' reputation as the main representative of classicism, in opposition to the romanticism represented at the same Salon by The Massacre at Chios by Delacroix.Ternois 1980, p. 70. Conceived in a Raphaelesque style relatively free of the archaisms for which he had been reproached in the past, it marked Ingres' grand return to the Paris art world after his years in Rome and Florence, and his abandonment of a more daring style. Ingres found himself celebrated throughout France. In January 1825 he was awarded the Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur by Charles X, and in June 1825 he was elected to the Institute. Numerous life drawings and painted studies for the painting survive. A small oil sketch of the composition is in the Mus√©e Ingres in Montauban.Radius 1968, p. 102. In 1855, Ingres repeated the figures of the Virgin and Child in a watercolor, Virgin and Child Appearing to Sts. Anthony of Padua and Leopold (Cambridge, Fogg Art Museum).Condon et al., pp. 134, 245.  References  Bibliography  * Arikha, Avigdor. J.A.D.

(Amsterdam, December 21, 1879 ‚Äì Amsterdam, December 6, 1961) was a Dutch accountant, and Professor in Business economics at the University of Amsterdam. He is particularly known for his contribution to the international debate about replacement costs in the 1920s.Clarke, Frank L., and Graeme W. Dean. Contributions of Limperg and Schmidt to the Replacement Cost Debate in the 1920s. Garlan, 1990.  Biography  Th√©odore Limperg was born late 1879 as the son of Theodorus Limperg, chief administrative officer in Amsterdam, and Mathilda Speijer. Because his father's first name and his were almost alike, he called himself Th. Limperg jr. throughout his life. He graduated in 1897 at the Commercial High School, and in 1900 obtained a teaching licence in accounting. In the same year he started his training to become Chartered Accountant at the Dutch Institute of Accountants (Nederlands Instituut van Accountants NIvA), predecessor of the Nederlands Instituut van Registeraccountants (NIVRA), and acquired his degree in 1904. Limperg had started working as assistant accountant to gain practical experience. In 1901 he was admitted to the Netherlands Institute of Accountants, and joined the accountancy firm Volmer & Co as member.A. van Seventer, \\" Limperg, Theodore Jr. (1879-1961)\\", in History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia, Garland Publishing, New York, 1996, p. 385. Some years later with his younger brother, who had become auditor, he founded the firm Th. and L. Limperg. This company merged in 1970 with Moret, De Jong & Starke to Moret & Limperg, which eventually merged into Ernst & Young. In 1922 Limperg was appointed Professor of Business Economics at the Municipal University of Amsterdam, nowadays University of Amsterdam. He ended his work as practicing accountant at the firm Th. and L. Limperg. In addition to his professorship he served in various administrative and advisory positions. During World War II within the Senate of the Municipal University of Amsterdam, he was one of the leading figures in the resistance against the Germans. He was dismissed from his post in April 1943 and was forced into hiding. His son, the architect Koen Limperg, belonged to the resistance group that organised the attack on the Amsterdam Resident registration office in 1943. He was later captured and executed 1 July 1943 in Overveen. After the Liberation Limperg took up his professorship again, and served another five years until his retirement in 1950. Limperg married twice: In 1906 with Emma Altink (deceased in 1947), and in 1953 with Marguerite Isabelle Marie Goossens. He had three children. Besides Koen he had a son Theo, who was a lawyer and specialized in copyright law, and a daughter Emmy, first economics teacher and later lecturer in Wageningen.  Work  Limpergs ideas on accountancy in general are considered of great significance for the development of accountancy and business economics in The Netherlands. However, he sparingly published. His collected works was largely compiled from college notes made by his disciples. Limperg's economic theories have become known through the writings of his students, especially through the work of Salomon Kleerekoper. Limperg has been named 'patriarch of the Dutch accountants.'Joost Ramaer. \\"Accountant Den Hartog moet het stuur blijven hanteren,\\" in: Volkskrant, 19 januari 2002. The cornerstone of his work was his theory about replacement value. = Accountancy = Limperg wanted to bring the accountancy practice and theory on a higher level. He published a series of articles starting in 1905 in the newly established Accountancy journal about the future direction of the profession, and its requirements. Another focus was on the relationship between accountancy and society. Limperg argued, that auditor reports should not only be prepared for direct clients, but for anyone who wants to take notice. In 1905 he became editor-in-chief at the Accountancy journal. In his articles he criticized the Nederlands Instituut van Accountants NIvA (Dutch Institute of Chartered Accountants), of which he was a member as well. The institute didn't take this for granted. When the board of the institute came into conflict with a fellow member, J.G.Ch. Volmer,Johannes Gerardus Charles Volmer (1865-1935), since 1909 Professor of Business Administration in Delft and in Rotterdam since 1914, was a colleague of Limperg for many years. Limperg chose his side. In 1906 Limperg was disbarred by Niva-governance. Many other members followed his example and stepped down. In the same year these dissidents jointly founded the Nederlandsche Accountants-Vereeniging NAV (Dutch Accountants Institute).Van Baalen, Peter J., and Luchien Karsten. \\"The Social Shaping of the early Dutch Management Schools-Professions and the power of Abstraction.\\" (2004). p. 23 In the years following Limperg would shape the organization a model accountancy organization. The Accountancy journal became the prime magazine of the association. The Nederlandsche Accountants-Vereeniging upheld stringent entrance requirements, and conducted its own examinations. A disciplinary board supervised the conduct of its members. The Nederlandsche Accountants- Vereeniging eventually merged into the Nederlands Instituut van Accountants in 1919. With the merge the new methods, quality standards for membership and the disciplinary board, became standard practice. In 1923 after a dispute with the publisher Limperg started a new monthly accountancy magazine, entitled Maandblad voor Accountancy en Bedrijfseconomie (MAB), which still exists nowadays. = Trade Education = Beside the accountancy profession, Limperg campaigned for quality improvement of the Dutch business education and trade education on an academic level in a separate university. In 1913 he got his way, when in Rotterdam the Netherlands School of Commerce was founded, which in 1973 became the Erasmus University Rotterdam. In 1921 in the University of Amsterdam a new Faculteit der Handelswetenschappen (Faculty of Trade science) got started, which would become the Faculty of Economics and Econometrics. Limperg would bear his mark on the organization and growth of the new faculty. He proposed additional auditor training, which started in 1929, and proposed to change its name to Faculty of Economics, which was implemented in 1935.Since 1987 it is named Faculty of Economics and Econometrics = Replacement value = In his days, buildings, machinery and inventories on the balance sheet were traditionally validated based on historical costs; the costs paid to produce or to purchase the item. Another, better picture of the value can be determined based on replacement costs; the price one would pay to produce or to purchase the item. As a consequence, the assets of the company should be regularly reassessed. That provides a revaluation reserve, which is part of the equity. This idea didn't originate from Limperg, but he did further develop the concept. His ideas had a decisive influence on the method of cost calculation and determination of profit in several Dutch companies, including Philips. The Dutch legislation offers a choice between valuation at historical cost or valuation at replacement cost. Even after the introduction of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for listed companies that still applies. Under International Financial Reporting Standards, the company is required to pay for the replacement of the value to be taken. For equipment they may continue to use the replacement cost. = Notable students of Limperg = Some of the most noted students of Limperg. * Abraham Mey (1890-1971), professor at the University of Amsterdam * Salomon Kleerekoper (1893-1970), professor at the University of Amsterdam * Henri Johan van der Schroeff (1900-1974), professor at the University of Amsterdam * Jacob Louis Mey (1900-1966), professor at University of Groningen until 1964 and then Technische Universiteit Delft * Jacobus Franciscus Hacco√ª (1903-1972), professor at the University of Amsterdam * Louis Jacques Zimmerman (1913-1998), professor at the University of Amsterdam * Joop Klant (1915-1994), professor at the University of Amsterdam, also a prose writer * Gerard Leonard Groeneveld (1904-1989), professor at the Catholic University Tilburg, delivered the collected works of Limperg Because many proponents of Limperg's theories taught at the University of Amsterdam (like Limperg himself), they are often called the \\"Amsterdam School\\" of accountancy.Mattessich, Richard. V. \\"Fritz Schmidt (1882‚Äì1950) and his pioneering work of current value accounting in comparison to Edwards and Bell's theory*.\\" Contemporary Accounting Research 2.2 (1986): p. 160. = Political views = Limperg can be seen in many ways as a social democrat. He didn't emphasize his political views too much, to uphold his position as scientist, but he was politically engaged. In November 1938 he co-authored with fourteen others (among them the later Minister of Finance Piet Lieftinck), an open letter to the government regarding the policy of public finance. The manifesto opposed the conservative politics promoted by the direct advisers to the government, and called for a more active economic policy. Limperg also espoused the Plan van de Arbeid (Labor Plan), a plan to combat the economical crisis, drawn up by Hein Vos and Jan Tinbergen in the early thirties. After the Second World War Limperg took a seat in the Board of Trustees of the scientific department of the Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen (Dutch Trade Union Confederation).  Recognition  The work of Limperg received much acknowledgements. In 1935 he was appointed honorary president of the Comit√© International de l'Organisation Scientifique. The Netherlands School of Commerce (now Erasmus University Rotterdam) awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1947. In 1950 he received the Wallace Clark Medal for his international contribution to scientific management. The Dutch inter- university institute for accountancy bears his name: Limperg Institute. This institute, in which five universities and the Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants (NBA), the Dutch association of auditors, cooperate, coordinates the Dutch postgraduate accountancy courses. The Institute organizes the annual Limperg Day, where the Limperg Medal is awarded to an individual, who has made a significant contribution to scientific research in the fields of accounting and auditing.

At the time it was the largest barge crane in the western United States. In the 1970s, Marine Boss was sold to J. Ray McDermott & Co., who had introduced the first 500-ton floating cranes for offshore platform construction in 1965 and were operating a similar fleet of barge- cranes under the McDermott Derrick Barge (DB) class. McDermott would later sell it for scrap in 1988 to Weeks Marine in New Jersey, who renamed it the Weeks 533 and refurbished it from 1997-2000. Weeks 533 is considered the flagship of the Weeks fleet. One of the tugboats returning Weeks 533 from Albany to New Jersey collided with the moored 750t crane barge N181 (aka Hank Hummel) near the Tappan Zee Bridge at night in heavy fog on 12 March 2016. That tug, the Specialist, subsequently sank, killing all three sailors. Although the mate, who was at the helm of Specialist, initially jumped clear from the stricken tug onto N181, he returned to help free a trapped crewmate and all hands aboard subsequently drowned. =Capacity= The Clyde Iron Works Model 52-DE crane can lift using the main hoist on a boom at any point in the crane's revolution; capacity rises to when using the main hoist oriented astern. Motive power for the main hoist is provided by a Caterpillar 3412 V-12 diesel engine, and electric power for the barge is provided by a Caterpillar 3406 I-6 diesel generator set. =Bridges built= * Rio Vista Bridge replacement span (1967) * San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge (1967) * San Diego‚ÄìCoronado Bridge (1969) * Queensway Twin Bridges (1971), near RMS Queen Mary at the Port of Long Beach * Fremont Bridge (Portland) (1973) File:San Diego-Coronado Bridge Construction (15556-12).jpgalt=Constructing the San Diego-Coronado BridgeMurphy Pacific's Marine Boss at work on the San Diego‚ÄìCoronado Bridge (c.1968) File:Space Shuttle Enterprise lifted onto deck of the U.S.S.

Mason John Mitchell Mason (March 19, 1770 - December 26, 1829) was an American preacher and theologian who was Provost of Columbia College in the early 1810s, and briefly President of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in the early 1820s. Biography Born in New York City,William Buell Sprague, Annals of the American Pulpit: Presbyterian (1859), p. 1-9. Mason was the son of a prominent clergyman. He graduated from Columbia College in May 1789, and in 1791 traveled to his father's home country of Scotland to study theology at the University of Edinburgh. =Preaching career= Towards the end of 1792, his studies in Edinburgh were interrupted by news of the death of his father, prompting Mason to return to the United States and accept the pastoral charge of the church with which his father was connected, in New York. He was licensed to preach in November, 1792; and, after preaching there for several months, was installed in April, 1793, as their pastor. On May 13, 1793, he married Ann Lefferts, with whom he had five sons and two daughters. Mason continued as pastor of his father's former church for seventeen years, where he developed a reputation as an excellent orator. In 1804, he received a Doctor of Divinity, and from 1806 to 1810, he published Christian Magazine. In 1810, he decided to begin a new congregation, directing the construction of a new church in Murray Street. While the new church was being built, his congregation held their meetings for public worship in the Presbyterian Church in Cedar Street. This caused some discord, as the Presbyterian Church used an unauthorized version of the Psalms. At the meeting of Synod in Philadelphia in the spring of 1811, Mason's alleged delinquency in associating with these Presbyterians led to a formal investigation. Although this was resolved in a conciliatory manner, it was widely discussed within the church, prompting Mason to write a work on Catholic Communion, which appeared about four years after, and which was well received. =Provostship and travels in Europe= In the summer of 1811, Mason accepted the office of Provost of Columbia College, and in the summer of 1812, the Murray Street Church was ready for occupancy. Mason took up the strenuous duties of running the congregation while continuing to work and teach at the college. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1816, his health declined to the point that he found it necessary to resign the office he had assumed in connection with the College, and he resolved to try the effect of a voyage to Europe. Mason then traveled extensively in France, Italy, and Switzerland, and then to England, where he arrived in time to attend the anniversary of the British and Foreign Bible Society, where he delivered a well-received address. In the autumn of 1817, Mason returned to the United States and resumed his pastoral duties. In the summer and autumn of 1819, he experienced, in two instances, a slight paralytic affection. After the second attack, he reluctantly consented to suspend his public labors for six weeks. He thereafter worked without further interruption until February, 1820, when, shortly after reading the portion of Scripture on which he intended to lecture, his recollection failed, his mind became confused, and, bursting into tears, he told the audience that his infirmity prevented him from proceeding. He continued to preach intermittently as his health allowed, finally resigned his pastoral charge on October 25, 1821. =President of Dickinson College= Prior to his paralytic episodes, he had been invited by the Trustees of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to become President of that institution. Believing that this would constitute a reduced workload, and hoping that the change of climate would be favorable to his health, he accepted the appointment. Mason moved to Carlisle and began serving in this office, but quickly realized that his health was inadequate for the job. While Mason was residing in Carlisle, one of his daughters, and then one of his sons, died. Mason transferred his relation from the Associate Reformed Church to the Presbyterian Church, and became a member of the Presbytery of New York, in 1822, as part of a large movement of people doing the same. Mason resigned his office as President of Dickinson College on May 1, 1824,Sherman Day, Historical Collections of the State of Pennsylvania (1843), p. 269. and returned to the city of New York. He withdrew from public life, and gradually lost his faculties, with brief periods of lucidity until his death, in 1829.

An oil painting on canvas measuring 147 x 199 cm, it is owned by the Louvre. Ingres subsequently painted several variants of the composition. Subject Orlando Furioso, a 16th-century epic poem by Ariosto, is the source of the tale of Roger, a knight whose steed is a hippogriff (a legendary creature half horse and half eagle). While riding near Brittany's coast Roger espies a beautiful woman, Angelica, chained to a rock on the Isle of Tears. She has been abducted and stripped naked by barbarians who have left her there as a human sacrifice to a sea monster. As Roger rides to her aid, a great thrashing in the water occurs‚Äîit is the monster approaching Angelica. Roger drives his lance between the monster's eyes and rescues Angelica.Condon et al. 1983, p. 238. Background Angelica, 1859, S√£o Paulo Museum of Art Ingres received the commission for the work in 1817 and completed it in 1819.Arikha 1986, p. 51. When it was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819 alongside his Grande Odalisque, the work was criticised for the treatment of Angelica's figure, described by the art historian Th√©ophile Silvestre as \\"Angelica with goitres\\" and by the painter Henry de Waroquier as \\"triple-breasted Angelica\\". Comte de Blacas, the French ambassador to the Vatican, acquired the painting for King Louis XVIII. It was installed above a doorway in the throne room of Versailles from 1820 until 1823 before being relocated to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. It was Ingres' first painting to enter a public collection. Ingres executed the work with his usual care, and many preparatory drawings for the composition and the individual figures exist. He painted several later versions of the composition, none of which are known to have been commissioned.Condon et al. 1983, p. 94. A reduced copy of the painting in a vertical format was painted sometime before 1839, and eventually acquired by Edgar Degas, who purchased it in 1894.Dumas 1996, pp. 25, 70. It was later acquired by the National Gallery, London. An 1841 replica, in an oval format, is in the Mus√©e Ingres. A painting of 1859, also in an oval format, repeats the figure of Angelica but nearly eliminates Roger, whose presence is indicated only by his shield visible at the right edge.Condon et al. 1983, p. 98. In 1825‚Äì30 Ingres painted Perseus and Andromeda (Detroit Institute of Arts), which like Roger Freeing Angelica features a nude woman chained to a rock and a hero slaying a sea monster.Mongan and Naef 1967, p. 51.

British dominance at sea, enforced by a strategy of close blockade, made it difficult for the French Navy to operate even in their own territorial waters. In the autumn of 1810, a British squadron assigned to patrol the Baie de la Seine was effectively isolating two French squadrons in the ports of Le Havre and Cherbourg. On 12 November, the squadron in Le Havre, consisting of frigates Elisa and Amazone attempted to reach Cherbourg at night in order to united the squadrons. This squadron was spotted in the early hours of 13 November by the patrolling British frigates HMS Diana and HMS Niobe, which gave chase. The French ships took shelter at the heavily fortified Iles Saint- Marcouf, sailing the following morning for the anchorage at Saint-Vaast-la- Hougue. For two days the British frigates kept watch, until two ships of the line from the blockade of Cherbourg, HMS Donegal and HMS Revenge, arrived. On 15 November, the British squadron attacked the anchored French ships, which were defended by shore batteries at La Hougue and Tatihou. After four attempts to close with the French the British squadron, under heavy fire, withdrew. During the night, the British commander, Captain Pulteney Malcolm, sent his ship's boats close inshore to attack the French ships with Congreve rockets, a newly issued weapon. None are recorded as landing on target, but by morning both frigates had been forced to change position, becoming grounded on the shore. The French ships were later refloated, and Malcolm's squadron maintained the blockade until 27 November when Amazone successfully escaped back to Le Havre. The damaged Elisa remained at anchor until 6 December, when an attack by a British bomb vessel forced the frigate to move further inshore, becoming grounded once more. Elisa remained in this position until 23 December, when the boats of Diana entered the anchorage at night and set the beached ship on fire, destroying her. Baie de la Seine in 1810 By 1810 the French Navy fleet based in the Atlantic ports had been prevented from launching any major operations for four years, penned into harbour by the British strategy of close blockade. A failed attempt by a French fleet to sail had been defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809, and the main operations still carried out by the Navy were undertaken by privateers and frigate squadrons operating commerce raiders operating from smaller ports, such as those on the English Channel.Gardiner, p. 111 In November 1810 squadrons were based at Cherbourg, with two ships of the line and the newly built frigate Iphig√©nie, and Le Havre, with the frigates Elisa and Amazone, commanded by Captains Louis-Henri Fraycinet-Saulce and Bernard-Louis Rosseau respectively. To blockade these squadrons, the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet had assigned the ships of the line HMS Donegal under Captain Pulteney Malcolm and HMS Revenge under Captain Charles Paget to patrol the entrance to Cherbourg, while frigates HMS Diana under Captain Charles Grant and HMS Niobe under Captain John Wentworth Loring kept watch on Le Havre.James, p. 239 The blockade had achieved some minor successes; in October 1810 Revenge had captured the privateer Vengeur from Dieppe, and on 6 November Donegal ran down and seized the privateer Surcouf from Cherbourg. =Pursuit of Amazone and Elisa= At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre to unite with the force at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the blockade in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore in an attempt to cut off the French line of advance. With the wind in the northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.Clowes, p. 474 At 11:00, Rosseau gave orders for the French frigates to sail once more, slipping away from the British ships which had drifted to the north and anchoring safely between the batteries at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and the island of Tatihou. Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up, Grant sent messages to Malcolm's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements. Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November, maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to drag her anchors.James, p. 240 Captain Fraycinet-Saulce was forced to throw much of the ship's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore. The following day, Diana took advantage of the rising tide to attack the anchored Amazone, Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from the batteries. Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate, each time beaten off by heavy fire from the batteries. Joined by Malcolm and the remainder of the British force, four successive attacks were launched against Amazone, each one driven back by cannon fire. At 13:00, with the tide falling, the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water, out of range of the French. All four British ships had suffered under fire, with two killed and five wounded on Revenge, three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana. French losses were a single man killed on Amazone. On the evening of 15 November Malcolm ordered the ship's boats of the squadron to approach the anchorage under cover of darkness, commanded by Lieutenant Joseph Needham Taylor. The boats had been equipped with Congreve rockets, a recently invented artillery system which was not then widely in use by the Royal Navy. None of the rockets fired during the night appeared to have hit their targets, but they seem to have panicked the French crews; dawn the following morning revealed that both frigates had cut their anchors and drifted onto the shore, Elisa in particular had struck hard and heeled over onto her side. Both ships were however successfully refloated by the rising tide on 16 November, and the situation reached an impasse, with Malcolm's forces blockading Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue to prevent the French from sailing. =Destruction of Elisa= For nearly two weeks the French frigates remained at anchor, Malcolm and Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships, when Amazone successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With Amazone gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa, calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal.James, p. 241 Over the next two weeks Elisa remained grounded, the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged. With the destruction of Elisa, the British squadrons returned to their blockade duties off Cherbourg and Le Havre. The blockade remained in place throughout the remainder of the Napoleonic Wars; Rosseau in Amazone made another attempt to join the squadron in Cherbourg in March 1811, only to be run down and destroyed by a squadron led by the ship of the line HMS Berwick.James, p. 332 The new Iphig√©nie survived a little longer, being intercepted and captured in the Atlantic during a raiding mission in January 1814.Clowes, p. 544  Notes   References   Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Conflicts in 1810 Category:November 1810 events ","title":"Action of 15 November 1810"},{"id":"45322088","text":"The George Jones Story is a double album by George Jones.

He reused the pose in two later works, Odalisque with Slave (1839) and Jupiter and Antiope (1851). History It was first conceived in 1807 while Ingres was at the French Academy in Rome as part of the portfolio as a 'pensionnaire' of the Academy. It was completed on 28 October 1809 and exhibited as number 58 in the Capitoline Museums. It was bought later that year by Joachim Murat, king of Naples for 50 louis‚Äìhe moved it to the smaller apartments of the royal palace. Murat's wife and queen consort Caroline commissioned the 1814 la Grande Odalisque as a pendant for the painting, on a canvas of the same dimensions. La Dormeuse de Naples disappeared in 1815 after the royal palace in Naples was pillaged following Murat's fall from power. It is only known through its preparatory studies, a drawing made from memory by Ingres and an old photograph of a study for it. In 1832 Ingres asked Caroline Murat about the painting by courier in an attempt to locate it in time to exhibit at the 1833 Salon, but this was unsuccessful. Several theories have arisen as to its present locations, inspiring the 2004 French novel La Dormeuse de Naples by Adrien Goetz. Description Ingres, drawing from memory of la Dormeuse de Naples, on the verso of his 1832 letter to Caroline Murat (Biblioth√®que Nationale, d√©partement des manuscrits). In his 1832 letter to Caroline Murat, Ingres described the painting and provided a rapid sketch of it from memory. Ingres stated that the painting showed a nude life-size female stretched out on a day-bed, her head resting on her left arm, which in turn rested on a cushion, and the right arm behind the head. Inspirations As with several other works from his neoclassical period, such as Jupiter and Thetis and Romulus, Vanquisher of Acron, Ingres was influenced by both classical sculpture and Renaissance painting. Like most reclining female nudes in western art, it derived from the posture of the Sleeping Ariadne sculpture in the Vatican Museums. Ingres' Renaissance sources included Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (which he knew from engravings) and Titian's Pardo Venus (the closest influence on the pose of Ingres' nude) and the Venus of Urbino (which he had studied in the Uffizi and of which he produced a copy in 1822).

The film is a drama that follows Lucy Dane and Will Harding and a jealous halfbreed trapper named Jos√©. Considering Will his rival, Jos√© attempts to ambush Will, but instead shoots Will's assistant. Jos√© then blames Will for the deed and Will is bound by a lynch mob and set to be executed. Lucy frees Will and sends the lynch mob away, but Jos√© encounters Will and the two fight. Jos√© is wounded and falls over a cliff, but Will is recaptured by the mob. From the bottom of the cliff, Jos√© calls out for help and Lucy responds to him. Jos√© confesses his crime to Lucy and she rushes to Will and prevents his execution. The film was directed by Barry O'Neil and was released on June 3, 1910. An incomplete print of the film survives in the Library of Congress after its rediscovery in 1978 as part of the Dawson Film Find.  Plot summary  The original synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World, it states: \\"This picture tells the story of Lucy Dane, a Canadian lumberman's daughter, and of Will Harding's love for her. Will is a worthy young surveyor and Lucy feels honored to have his love, and returns it. Jos√©, halfbreed trapper, adores Lucy and necessarily dislikes Will, whom he correctly counts his successful rival. More, he bears Will a grudge for responding to Lucy's cries for help when he forced his attentions on her in the lonely neck of the woods. His chance to even matters with Will come shortly when he fastens on the surveyor's responsibility for the shooting of the latter's assistant, of which the halfbreed is himself guilty, having shot the assistant from ambush in mistake for Will. Jos√© claims he witnessed Will's alleged deed and his falsehoods are believed by the lumbermen. Rarely are the courts resorted to in that portion of the North where these events transpired and the rough lumbermen quickly decide to lynch Will. Lucy hears of the fate intended for her sweetheart and cuts his bonds. Further, she sends the lumbermen off in the wrong direction when they set out to recapture Will. The fugitive is spied by the halfbreed, who steals up from behind and attempts to knife him. The surveyor turns just in time, and in the ensuing struggle the halfbreed is wounded and falls over a precipice. At this juncture Will is retaken by the lumbermen.\\" \\"They are leading him to his execution, when the faithful Lucy encounters her sweetheart and whispers: 'Ask for a drink at the brook!' Will follows her suggestion, and on stooping to drink finds a revolver which Lucy has placed there for his use. But he is overpowered when he attempts to use the gun and despite Lucy's effort seems doomed to die. Jos√©, the guilty halfbreed, dying at the bottom of the precipice, calls for help. His cries are heard by Lucy, who responds and finds Jos√© expiring and repentant. He wishes to clear his conscious before facing his Maker and tells Lucy that he shot Will's assistant. He puts his confession in writing and, relieved, passes peacefully away. In the meantime the lumbermen have completed the preparations that will make an innocent man pay the penalty of another man's crime. Already the noose is about Will's neck and a death prayer on his lips and then, in the nick of time, Lucy arrives with the precious confession, and Will gathers his faithful sweetheart to him in the tenderest scene that has ever closed a thrilling picture.\\"  Cast  *Anna Rosemond as Lucy Dane *Frank H. Crane as Will Harding  Production  The film was directed by Barry O'Neil, the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it is presumably Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. Edwin Thanhouser would later recall that this production featured a minor part of a woodsman who ended up ruining the scene through excessive smoking. He described the young actor trying to focus attention on himself by smoking \\"like the consolidation of seven chimneys\\", but ended up obscuring the action of the scene. The two known credits in the film are for the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. According to an article in the New Rochelle Pioneer the film was produced in New Rochelle and according to a news release the film was shot in the mountains during real blizzard weather. Bowers believes this film was shot during the winter and kept for its later June release. The winter of 1909 through 1910 contained two notable snow events that might have possibly been used in the production. A major snow storm from December 25 to December 26, 1909, would make its way through New York City with snow total of about 10 inches and wind gusts up to 58 mph. A second major snow event occurred three weeks later, on January 14 through 15, 1910, with New York City getting 15 inches of snow. Another lesser snow event, deemed a blizzard in the press, was recorded in early February.  Release and reception  The one reel drama, approximately 935 feet, was released on June 3, 1910. The film was originally set to be the first release distributed through the Motion Picture Distribution and Sales Company, but a dispute with Carl Laemmle pushed the date back more than a month. The film was reviewed positively in The Moving Picture World for the real snow and weather and for being a high-class drama. A shorter modern synopsis from the incomplete surviving print from the Library of Congress indicates that the film is lost after the halfbreed falls from the precipice. The film was released nationwide and theater advertisements for the film are known in Kansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. The survival and rediscovery of this film was by happenstance in the Canadian gold rush town of Dawson City, in Yukon, Canada. Beginning in 1903, the Dawson Amateur Athletic Association began showing films and the unreturned films were deposited in the Canadian Bank of Commerce and stored in the Carnegie library's basement. The Dawson Amateur Athletic Association later converted a pool to an ice rink, but because of improper conversion the ice rink suffered from uneven temperatures in the middle of the rink. In 1929, Clifford Thomson, then-employed by the Canadian Bank of Commerce and also treasurer of the hockey association, solved the problem of the library's stock of film and the inadequate ice rink. Thomson took 500,000 feet of film and stacked the reels in the pool, covered the reels with boards and leveled the rink with a layer of earth. Dawson Amateur Athletic Association continued to receive new nitrate films which would later fuel the destruction of the entire complex in a fire in 1951. The films stored under the ice rink were preserved and uncovered in 1978 when a new recreation center was being built. The Dawson Film Find material was collected and preserved, with these prints becoming the last surviving records of these studios. The surviving and incomplete print of The Girl of the Northern Woods was one of the films recovered at Dawson City.

Career Hamelinus established a charter which allowed 'The order of St. Gilbert of Sempringham' the creation of Alvingham Priory during the time of Pope Eugene III, between 1145 and 1153. The Charter also shows that the Church of Alvingham was given to Robert de Chesney, then Bishop of Lincoln, who invested the monks at Alvingham Priory. Hamelinus had made during this time substantial land donations to Alvingham Priory. Hamelinus goes on to provide a gift to the Gilbertine nuns three- quarters of 'his' Parish Church of Alvingham to add to that given to them by their founder Roger, son of Jocelin. Therefore, he must have been the Vicar of the Parish Church of Alvingham, as well as its patron and a substantial land holder. The ecclesiae Anglicanae records that about 1164 Hamelinus was a Dean of Lincoln. He is referred to by some however as Dean of Yarburgh (Yarburgh becoming Yarborough). As the Church in Alvingham was in Louthesk he is more likely to have been Dean there however (Louthesk becoming Ludborough), although as always with these things this is not clear. Regardless, about he is also shown as a Prebendary of Aylesbury which at this time appeared to be a role performed by a Dean of Lincoln. Hamelinus is known to have resigned from his deanery position however and joined Alvingham Priory as a canon. There he made further gifts of land from the Parish of Grainthorpe. Family Hamelinus appears to have been married for he had at least five sons, one of whom was called Brian. He was probably the nephew of Hugh of Avalon who was Bishop of Lincoln.

The German military commander of Rome, General Reiner Stahel, was initially wary that any action against the Jews of Rome would draw condemnation from Pope Pius XII, of which he had been warned by Bishop Alois Hudal, rector of the German church in Rome. This condemnation, however, never materialised, which has led to considerable controversy. Stahel decided against ordering deportation without official authority from the German foreign ministry. Germany's Consul-General Eitel Friedrich M√∂llhausen went so far as to write to Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in order to suggest that the Roman Jews be interned in Italian camps rather than deported, but Ribbentrop never dared to act against the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), from which Stahel received his orders. The role of the German ambassador to the Vatican, Ernst von Weizs√§cker, in these events remains a matter of controversy. On 26 September, Herbert Kappler, commander of the SS and the Gestapo in Rome, announced to the Jewish community in the city that unless they handed over of gold, 200 Jewish family heads would be deported. The community delivered this sum on the deadline of midday, 28 September, with the assistance of the non-Jewish citizens of Rome. This left the Jewish community with the impression that the Germans were only after loot, especially the priceless treasures of the Biblioteca della Comunit√† Israelitica community library. Raid On the morning of 16 October 1943, 365 German security and police forces (the Italian police were considered too unreliable) sealed off the Ghetto, which held a large part of the Jewish community at the time, turning it into a virtual prison. Theodor Dannecker, recently appointed chief of the Judenreferat in Italy and tasked with implementing the Final Solution, the genocide of the Jews, in Italy, had ordered the Ghetto to be cleared. Some Jews in the Ghetto managed to escape over rooftops. In the raid, 1,259 people were detained, comprising 363 men, 689 women, and 207 children. Afterwards, non-Jewish prisoners were released while 1,023 Jews were taken to the Collegio militare in the Palazzo Salviati in Trastevere. Two days later, at least 1,035 prisoners were loaded onto Holocaust trains at Tiburtina station and deported to Auschwitz. Only 16 survived. Aftermath At the time of the raid, Fascist Italy had not yet adopted a policy of persecution against the Jews in the country. This only followed in late November 1943, after the Congress of Verona and the issuing of RSI Police Order No. 5 on 30 November 1943, a month and a half after the raid on the Ghetto. During the last eight months of the German occupation, the Jews of Rome continued to live in hiding, under constant threat of arrest and deportation, until the liberation of the city by the Allies on 4 June 1944. In total, a quarter of the Jewish population of Rome‚Äîover 2,000 people‚Äîwas deported, of which only 102 survived the Holocaust. Additionally, another 75 Roman Jews were murdered in the Ardeatine massacre, when 335 civilians were executed as a reprisal for a bombing attack on SS soldiers. The Italian police in Rome, unlike in many other parts of German-occupied Italy, did not participate in the arrests of Jews, and the general public objected and resisted such arrests. For these reasons, a sizeable proportion of the Jews in Rome avoided arrest and survived the Holocaust, often hiding in the Vatican or other Catholic institutions. Of the main perpetrators, Theodor Dannecker committed suicide following his capture in December 1945. Herbert Kappler was sentenced by a military court in 1948 to life imprisonment for his role in the Ardeatine massacre, escaped prison in 1977, and died less than a year later. Pope Pius XII's role in the events has been the subject of considerable controversy, due to the proximity of the Vatican and the Roman Ghetto. According to Michael Phayer, \\"the question of the pope's silence has become the focus of intense historical debate and analysis\\" because the deportations occurred \\"under his very windows\\". The term \\"under his very windows\\" was used as the title of a book on the subject by American historian Susan Zuccotti.Phayer, 2008, p. 70. The phrase is based on an actual quotation from the report of Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the German ambassador to the Vatican, who reported to Berlin that the razzia had taken place \\"under the Pope's windows\\".S√°nchez, 2002, p. 26.John T. Pawlikowski. \\"The Papacy of Pius XII: The Known and the Unknown\\". In Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 77. British historian Ian Kershaw wrote that \\"A strong and unequivocal protest from the Pontiff might well have deterred the German occupiers, unsure of the reactions, and prevented the deportations of the Jews they could lay their hands upon. The Germans were expecting such a protest. It never came.\\" Commemoration A number of stone plaques have been unveiled in the Roman Ghetto and at Tiburtina railway station to commemorate the arrest and deportation of the Jews of Rome in October 1943.

It was released on the Musicor label in 1968. Background One criticism of Jones's time at Musicor, which lasted from 1965 to 1971, was the lack of quality control. Jones recorded an enormous amount of material during this time and almost all of it got issued on LPs. The label had released a double album called The George Jones Story in 1968, which featured a mix of old and new songs, and My Country repeats the process. These packages, combined with LPs still being released by his earlier labels Mercury and United Artists, resulted in the market being flooded with releases by \\"the Possum.\\" In the 1989 documentary Same Ole Me, Starday president Don Pierce recalls producer Pappy Daily's stewardship of Jones's career: \\"Well, we took him to Mercury, and he became the artist for their country division, and then he took him to United Artists, and he was the country music division at United Artists. Then we took him to Musicor and he was the country division at Musicor, and so a lot of people have been ridin' on ol' George.\\" The cavalier approach taken by Musicor to his recordings would make Jones increasingly unhappy as time went on.

Life and career Born in Stockton, California, Helen Papashvily attended the University of California, Berkeley. She met her husband, George Papashvily in 1930, while she was managing a bookstore in Berkeley. The two married in 1933. After a brief stint in New York City, George and Helen bought a farm and settled in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. In 1940, Papashvily opened the Moby Dick Bookshop located at 630 Turner St., Allentown, Pennsylvania. While book selling occupied her days, she spent her mornings writing articles and short stories for publications such as Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, the Saturday Evening Post, and The New York Times. An editor at Harper's read her short story \\"The Sound of Home\\" published in Common Ground and approached her about turning it into a book. Working with her husband, Helen wrote Anything Can Happen (1945), a humorous account of George's experiences as a new immigrant in the United States. Anything Can Happen was a surprise hit, and was chosen as a Book of the Month Club selection in January 1945. In April 1945, an Armed Services Edition of the book was published and distributed to American troops fighting in World War II. Seven years later, Paramount bought the rights and turned the story into a movie. Directed by George Seaton, the film starred Jos√© Ferrer as George and Kim Hunter as Helen. The story tells of the arrival of a Georgian immigrant to America in the 1930s, and the moral of the story is that people should be more tolerant of those who were born elsewhere. After Anything Can Happen, Papashvily wrote a number of other books with George including Yes and No Stories (1946), Thanks to Noah (1951), Dogs and People (1954), and Home and Home Again (1973). The two even wrote a book on Georgian cooking, which was published by Time-Life books in 1969. Papashvily also wrote several books on her own. Papashvily used her fame as a writer to advocate for public libraries. She spoke at library meetings across the country and was a member of the Friends of the Allentown Public Library and the Friends of the Lehigh University Libraries. In 1985, Papashvily received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Lehigh University. A year later, she was chosen by Governor Dick Thornburgh as a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania, citing her approach to race and her work with libraries. Papashvily had no children.

Quote is published monthly and provides information about business, money, careers, networks and lives of people at the top. In December 1999, the magazine was named \\"Magazine of the Year\\" by the Nederlandse Uitgeversbond (Dutch Publishers Association). First published in November 1986, and named for a term for a stock price, Quote was sold by the founder, Maarten van den Biggelaar, and two friends to Hachette Filipacchi M√©dias (HFM) on July 21, 2006. Chief editor Jort Kelder then stepped down in April 2007 after more than thirteen years at the helm. In November 2002, Quote published the first picture of real estate speculator Willem Endstra together with released felon Willem Holleeder, who had served a prison sentence as the convicted kidnapper of beer magnate Alfred Heineken. The two were sitting on a bench outside Endstra's offices in the Amsterdam Oud-Zuid borough. Endstra, who had always denied his links with the underworld, filed for a preliminary injunction demanding that Quote be withdrawn from sale. He said he feared for his safety. Initially, his claim was upheld, but a few days later the injunction was overturned. Endstra was murdered two years later, and Holleeder was reimprisoned after having been convicted on a charge of extortion. In November 2003, the editor of Quote was shot; the culprit was never found. A few days earlier, the home of Van den Biggelaar was shot at as well. In January 2005, Quote was in the headlines with a claim that in 1998, Nina Brink, the founder of World Online, a Dutch Internet service provider, had been involved in a premeditated sex scandal and was forced to resign. Brink announced that she would take legal action, but failed to bring a lawsuit. A declaration that she subsequently filed with the Amsterdam public prosecutor to support her libel claim was declared inadmissible in May due to the lack of solid legal basis. On 1 November 2011, Mirjam van den Broeke succeeded Sjoerd van Stokkum as the new editor. Former editor Jort Kelder temporarily returned to the business magazine as advisor to the new editor.

It was produced on Broadway by David Belasco in 1907 and was the basis for two films in 1915 (directed by the playwright's brother, Cecil B. DeMille) and in 1924. The play was also the basis for a novelization by author George Cary Eggleston in 1908. Broadway run The Warrens of Virginia premiered in New York at the Belasco Theater (formerly the Stuyvesant Theater) on December 3, 1907. The production ran for a total of 380 performances, finally closing in October, 1908. The producer was Broadway impresario David Belasco, and the show starred Charles Waldron as Lt. Ned Burton and Charlotte Walker as Agatha Warren. The production marked the Broadway debut of supporting player Mary Pickford as Betty Warren, her first major professional role after years of touring in small regional troupes under her given name, Gladys Smith. It was at Belasco's insistence that she adopted the stage name \\"Mary Pickford\\" for the show. Another notable supporting player, in the role of Arthur Warren, was the playwright's brother, Cecil B. DeMille, who went on to direct The Warrens of Virginia in a silent film version in 1915.

Warren, the general hosts an elegant ball to honor his old comrade in the Mexican War, General Griffin. Griffin's nephew, Ned Burton, who has been courting Gen. Warren's daughter, Agatha, now proposes marriage to her. But before she can answer, a courier arrives with news of the shelling of Fort Sumter. The Confederate States will declare their secession from the Union. Ned - torn by his love for Agatha, a Southern sympathizer, and love of country - decides to join the Union Army as a Lieutenant while Agatha's father, Gen. Warren, takes command of his Confederate forces. Four years later, starving Confederate troops wait desperately for a supply train and reinforcements. After Ned is invited to call at the Warren home, Gen. Griffin plants phony orders on him so that they will be found and the train re-routed. The ruse works and the supply train is destroyed. When Ned is about to be shot as a spy, Agatha arranges his escape, but he is too proud to accept her help. When Lee surrenders, Ned is freed. Thinking that he betrayed her, Agatha rebukes Ned, but Gen. Griffin explains his deceptive ploy, and Agatha now accepts Ned's marriage proposal.

It means something like the \\"local mountain\\" or \\"local hill\\" closely associated with a settlement by its population. The Hausberg forms a backdrop to its home settlement and also offers a prominent viewing point looking over the settlement.

Biography Howard was born on May 7, 1835 to Waldo and Mary Howard in Brockport, New York. In the year following his birth, his family moved to Flint, Michigan. He was educated in public schools. At age fifteen, Howard began working in local newspaper offices; first at the Genesee Democrat and later the Wolverine Citizen. When he was 19, Howard began reading law at a local law office. Soon after, he enrolled at the State and National Law School in Poughkeepsie, New York and graduated in either 1855 or 1856. Following graduation, Howard returned to Michigan and became a defense attorney. His first big case was the acquittal by reason of insanity of Joshua Solomon Johnson, who was accused of killing a father and his two sons. As a result of his courtroom performance, Howard gained a reputation as one of the state's best trial lawyers of his day. Howard married Lucy R. Mason in 1857. The union produced a daughter, May, and an adopted son, Frank. Running on the Democratic ticket, Howard was elected Genesee County prosecutor in 1858. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Howard volunteered for the infantry and was commissioned a second lieutenant in July 1861. For the majority of the war, he was assigned recruiting duties. Howard was scheduled to become captain of a 100-man company that he had raised shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg, but an illness prevented him from assuming command. Howard resigned from military in September 1863 and returned to Flint, Michigan. Howard ran for Genesee County prosecutor on the Republican ticket in 1864. He was re-elected and served three consecutive terms. Howard represented Flint's third ward on the city council from 1866 till 1870. He served as a delegate to Michigan's 1867 constitutional convention and advocated for prohibition during the proceedings. On March 30, 1876, President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Howard to become United States Attorney for Utah Territory. In this role, Howard was the prosecutor of John Doyle Lee for his involvement in the Mountain Meadows massacre. Following Lee's prosecution, Howard planned prosecutions of other Mormon leaders, including Brigham Young. After Young died, Howard felt his task in Utah was completed and submitted his resignation at the beginning of 1878. He then returned to Michigan and private legal practice. Howard was a delegate to 1880 Republican National Convention. Two years later he was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives. In the legislature, Howard was selected as Speaker of the House and was influential in the election of Thomas W. Palmer over Thomas W. Ferry for a seat in the United States Senate. He was selected as a delegate for the 1884 Republican National Convention, but did not attend. President Chester A. Arthur nominated Howard to become Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on March 18, 1884. He had requested an appointment in Utah but was instead sent to Arizona. The new Chief Justice was commissioned on March 26 and took the oath of office in Prescott on May 20, 1884. Howard was assigned to the third judicial district, encompassing Apache, Mohave, and Yavapai counties (an area that includes the modern day Coconino and Navajo counties). Three appellate rulings authored by Howard are in the Arizona Reports. In Tidball v. Williams, 2 Arizona 50 (1885), Howard found that United States Commissioners have jurisdiction outside their district of residence even if they rarely use it and that a Marshal may serve an arrest warrant which uses a fictitious name. In The Copper Queen Mining Company v. The Arizona Prince Copper Company, 2 Arizona (1885), the parties to the dispute had arranged for the Cochise County sheriff to have the jury members \\"feasted and wined\\" during the original trial. During the appeal, Howard found there were no grounds to overturn the original ruling as no evidence that any juror was too intoxicated to perform his function had been presented. Howard's findings in Paul v. Callum, 2 Arizona 16 (1885) were later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. With President Grover Cleveland having come into office, Howard sensed he was about to be removed and resigned in October 1885 to ease the appointment of John C. Shields to the Arizona bench. Shields' nomination was later rejected by the United States Senate. Upon returning to private life, he formed a law partnership with John A. Rush and Edmund W. Wells. Howard continued to practice law by himself after the partnership dissolved in 1887. Howard was elected Mayor of Prescott on January 4, 1887 after running without opposition. The next year he represented Arizona Territory as a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention. In June 1889, Howard sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General William H. H. Miller requesting reappointment to the Arizona bench. Despite any supporting evidence corroborating the claim, the letter bears a hand-written note saying \\"Drinks too much\\". In his later years, Howard returned to Flint, Michigan. There he developed an interest in agriculture, serving on the county fair board and operating a small farm in Burton.

May 2, 1892) was an American jurist who served as Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. Granted a recess appointment by President Grover Cleveland, he is the only nominee to the Arizona territorial bench who was denied senate confirmation. Early life and education Shields was born on January 21, 1848 to John and Elizabeth (McCabe) Shields in Livingston County, Michigan. Both of his parents were Irish immigrants. He was educated in public schools and graduated from normal school at age 17. For the next four years, Shields taught at a school. In 1869, he was admitted to the Michigan bar. He then enrolled at the University of Michigan and graduated with a law degree in 1872. Following graduation, Shields practiced law with his brother, Dennis, in Howell. He moved to Lansing in late 1874 or early 1875. In 1875, Shields married Nellie Stanbaugh. Shields moved to Alpena and formed a partnership with J. T. Turnbull in 1885. Chief Justice The post of Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court was filled in March 1884 by Sumner Howard, an appointee of President Chester A. Arthur. With the election of President Grover Cleveland, Howard sensed he was about to be removed and resigned in October 1885 to ease the appointment of Shields to the Arizona bench. On October 23, 1885, President Cleveland appointed Shields as Chief Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. One of the most intellectual men to preside on the territorial bench, Shields took his oath of office on November 9, 1885 in Prescott, Arizona Territory. There was a district court session already in progress when the new justice took office, and a session of the territorial supreme court scheduled for January. Shortly after his arrival, Shields requested a leave of absence following the January session to \\"close up my business\\" back in Michigan. The Arizona Reports lists eight opinions authored by Shields. Several had only short term importance such as a procedural matter in Soloman v. Norton, 2 Arizona 100 (1886), a mortgage foreclosure case, Asher v. Cox, 2 Arizona 71 (1886), or Mooney v. Broadway, 2 Arizona 107, which allowed the plaintiff to collect a debt from the Maricopa County sheriff after it was determined the original payment had been lost due to \\"negligent acts and omissions\\" by the officer. Territory of Arizona v. Davis, 2 Arizona 59 (1886), ordered a new trial for a convicted murderer due to evidence being excluded in the original trial. Waller v. Hughes, 2 Arizona 114 (1886), dealt with a man who felt he should not have to pay taxes on a mine because the federal government had not provided him with a patent to the mining claim. Shields found that the payment of taxes by the owner, and acceptance of the payment by the government, established title to the property in absence of the patent. The Chief Justice's ruling in Jeffords v. Hines, 2 Arizona 162 (1886), along with its twin case, United States v. Tenney and Christofferson, 2 Arizona 127 (1886), attracted considerable attention by upholding convictions under the Edmunds Act of Mormons who practiced polygamy. Shields' time on the bench ended on June 7, 1886 when the United States Senate refused to confirm his nomination. The nomination had run into problems due to senatorial courtesy, with Senator Omar D. Conger of Michigan blocking it. The rejection was denounced by a variety of sources, with Senator Richard Coke of Texas saying, \\"I do not believe he has had proper treatment before the Senate\\" and calling for the nomination to be resubmitted because Shields had no opportunity to respond to \\"vague and indefinite allegations made against him evidently by personal enemies\\". The nominee blamed the rejection upon \\"a senator from Michigan opposed to me simply and only on political grounds, and that under the 'courtesy of the senate' left the whole matter in his hands\\". President Cleveland resubmitted the nomination on July 1. The matter was referred to the Judiciary committee but no further actions were taken. After leaving the bench, Shields returned to his private legal practice in Alpena, Michigan. While his health was not good during his time in Arizona, it began to decline further upon his return home. During the winter of 18912, he suffered a stroke and a severe bout of grippe. The stroke left his paralyzed. His final months were spent in the care of his sister in Fowlerville. Shields died by May 2, 1892. He was buried in Lansing's St. Mary's Cemetery (now St. Joseph's Cemetery).

Frederic William Maitland, author of The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, has said that \\"treason is a crime [with] a vague circumference and more than one centre.\\" Early French and Anglo-Saxon laws for the prosecution of persons deemed traitorous were inspired by, and in some cases, directly pulled from, late Roman and Germanic conceptions of the crime. It would be the common laws of this time period which would most directly influence those customary in King Arthur's court ‚Äî assuming its existence is founded in more than the legends and fables of medieval romances. The origins of the word treason, as speakers of English would recognize it, date to the 13th century. Indeed, prior to the Treason Act of 1351, there were few laws which outlined comprehensively the legal qualifications for treason, or the appropriate punishments for said crimes. The process of conviction, trial, and sentencing of traitors such as Lancelot or Mordred in Arthurian literature was greatly informed by the very real, very gruesome practices of both French and English courts, depending on the geopolitical origin of the text's author. Pre-Norman Conquest Conceptions of Treason =Roman Definitions of High Treason= While it is difficult to pinpoint precisely where the concept of treason originated, as it presumably is as old as history itself, the earliest legal documents pertaining to it are of Roman writ. Its first Latin manifestation came in the form of perduellio, which etymologically stems from the Latin terminology for \\"base enemy,\\" or \\"wicked warfare.\\" Thomas R. Robinson of the Georgetown law journal defines perduellio as referring to an enemy to the state \\"devoid of the virtues of a [foreign] enemy; openness and frankness; a treacherous enemy from within.\\" He also writes that \\"it is safe to assert that perduellio was, in the beginning, largely an offence against the military power [of Rome].\\" While its etymological denotations would imply that perduellio was reserved strictly for military offenses, Elmer Truesdell Merrill states in Cases of Treason in the Roman Commonwealth that it is Towards the end of the Republic, perduellio was phased out of its common usage, in favor of a term which, in the words of Merrill, \\"did not seem to suggest the idea of military delinquency as its essential element of applicability.\\" Crimen maiestatis, or \\"majestic offenses\\", became the general-purpose term for all acts falling under the category of treason. Following the rise of crimen maiestatis in popular use, perduellio was retrospectively relegated to solely military insurrections and rebellions. Maiestatis literally refers to the supreme status and dignity of the nation, but was more commonly used to refer to the supreme dignitary of the state, his majesty the emperor. This informed the later middle age interpretations of treason as offenses specifically contra the royal family. Two laws in particular, lex Julia Maiestatis and lex Quisquis, served to frame the general definitions of treason not only in Rome, but in early medieval Europe, centuries later. lex Julia Maiestatis defined the following as treason: Lex Quisquis appended the previous statute to include assassination of the emperors councillors, failing to reveal or report a treasonous plot, and perhaps most importantly, the cogitation of treasonous acts against the crown, or \\"cognitaverit contra animam regis,\\" as acts of treason. It is \\"best known,\\" however, \\"for its provisions on punishment.\\" Lex Quisquis most directly influenced early French statues on treason, but both lex Julia Maiestatis and lex Quisquis were borrowed from heavily in the formation of the English Statute of Treasons of 1352. =Germanic Definitions of High Treason= The British Isles maintained, historically, some level of isolation and autonomy from mainland European powers. While waves of Romanism washed across much of continental Europe, Britain stood resolute. Therefore, \\"the laws of the anglo-saxons were affected by this process more slowly than those of most other Germanic peoples.\\" Moreover, \\"what Roman influence there was,\\" claims John G. Bellamy in his book, The Law of Treason in England in the Later Middle Ages, \\"may have [only] been conveyed to England through the Church.\\" This left early Anglo-Saxon perceptions of treason to very closely mimic greater Germanic doctrine. In contrast to the Roman axiom of holding the emperor above all, as a physical embodiment of the dignity of the nation, pure Germanic treason was defined by loyalty to one's lord ‚Äî with \\"no special sanctions against hostility directed towards the king.\\" In early Germanic cultures, \\"[a] King lived and ruled under the laws of his people.\\" The dignity of the state, therefore, would truly mean the dignity of the res publica. Treason consequently took on a very personal definition, in the form of treubruch, or a breach of faith or trust. Ironically, by the fall of the Roman Empire in Europe, circa 500 AD, Britain could no longer withstand bending to Roman influence. Using treubruch to describe treason was falling out of fashion, with laws barring the general violation of strictly royal dignity taking its place. Treason was also, possibly for the first time, being divided into categories of high and petty treason. The Code of Alfred, otherwise known as the Doom Book, was a compilation of Saxon laws written circa 900 AD which differentiated high treason from petty treason as offenses committed directly against the king, versus those committed against one's immediate lord. Forgery of national currency was also recognized for the first time as treason, although its classification was fluid, as the severity of the crime was determined by the scope of the act's negative influence. Post-Norman Conquest Conceptions of Treason =French Definitions of High Treason= French Royal officials adopted the Roman laws of lex Julia maiestatis and lex Quisquis. They defined the highest form of treason as Regicide, or the murder of a king. Second to the actual assassination of a monarch were attempts to depose him. Plots to overthrow the king, deposition, and conspiracy to \\"replace him at the helm of government,\\" were all defined as high treason. Although threats against the king were considered most grave in nature, those made against the royal family were also serious offenses. Causing harm to any members of the royal family also constituted treason. Beyond the self-evident treasonous crimes of murder, injury, and conspiracy, were more vaguely defined offenses involving the royal family. Those implicated in scandals surrounding members of the royal family could also be accused of treason. In 1314 \\"Philippe and Gauthier Aulnay, minor nobles of Philippe IV's household, were executed as 'the worst kind of traitors' for their adulterous relationships with the king's daughters-in-law.\\" =English Definitions of High Treason= Later medieval definitions of English treason were derived primarily from antiquated Germanic and Roman sources. As in the Roman statute of lex Quisquis, failing to reveal a treasonous plot was considered, and therefore punished, as complicity in said plot; also, those suspected of plotting treason would be tried as if said plot had been carried out, and sentenced to the same punishment as one guilty of the actual act. The English also adopted the French concept of cas royeaux, defining treason as a general violation of royal dignity. Through the Magna Carta, however, \\"English kings [were] prevented [from] becoming theocratic monarchs by means of Baronic cohesion.\\" This meant, at least legally, that barons were provided (albeit limited) forum to raise grievances against the crown, in the name of the defense of their own collective rights as barons. Magna carta was signed in 1215, and was swiftly annulled, but nevertheless had long-lasting implications on English common law. England's first \\"official\\" statute outlying various legal definitions of treason came from the Treason Act of 1351, and subsequent English Statute of Treasons of 1352. Both served to codify a collection of various crimes under a general heading of treason, and provided appropriate, standardized punishments for said offenses. The statute was also impactful through its creation of new types of state trial, designed specifically for alleged traitors. There were typically three parties involved in English treason trials: an \\"actor,\\" or plaintiff, a defendant, and a judge. This three party construction was considered \\"one of the cardinal rules of English law...in matters of jurisdiction.\\" In cases of lese-majesty, or injury committed against the king, the king was automatically considered the plaintiff and thus could not act as the judge in a treason trial. Instead, a judicial council was selected to determine if the offense in question constituted treason. English treason law also consisted of complex laws concerning the treatment of accessories to treasonous crimes. Until the principal offender in a treason case had been convicted, \\"an accessory of an alleged crime could not be proceeded against.\\" If both an accessory and a principle tried to flee, then both would be considered guilty. However, if only the principle attempted to evade arrest, then proceedings against the accessory could not commence until such time as the principle was apprehended. =Treason and knighthood= Knightly treason was seen, naturally, as a betrayal of a knight's chivalric code. By its nature, treason betrays the chivalric values of loyalty and brotherhood. The status of knighthood was fiercely defended as one of true nobility and manhood. Therefore, knights who committed treasonous crimes threatened to undermine the sanctity of the order as a whole, and all that it stood for. Thus, punishments for knights and nobles deemed traitors typically involved some kind of process in which their identities as both knights, and men, were stripped away. Executions of treasonous knights included a process of removing the physical representations of their titles, such as \\"breaking of the traitor's sword and striking of his spurs, removing his sword belt, and publicly stripping him of the rich clothing that visually communicated his status.\\" Punishments could also include an either literal or symbolic emasculation of the accused, through dismemberment or disembowelment. These punishments \\"feminized\\" the traitor, thus separating him from the ranks of \\"true knights\\" and \\"true men,\\" implying that his status as a traitor rendered him a \\"false\\" version of both. By severing those convicted of treason from their identities as knights and men, they thus preserved the \\"elite masculine identity\\" of knighthood. =Treason in Sir Thomas Malory's time= Sir Thomas Malory, author and compiler of Le Morte d‚ÄôArthur, the preeminent compilation of Arthuriana of its time, was writing during a time of great political upheaval in Britain. As Robert Kelly writes in his article \\"Malory and the Common Law\\", \\"treason cases were never more politicized and controversial in the late medieval period than they were in Malory's time during the conflict between the Lancastrians and the Yorkists...\\" The War of the Roses was a series of sporadic political conflicts in Britain for the throne, spanning from 1455 to 1487. The war was fought between two rival factions of the House of Plantagenet ‚Äî Lancaster and York ‚Äî for ultimate control of the crown, and was ended when a Lancaster, Henry Tudor, defeated Yorkist king Richard the III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, though there were several smaller political skirmishes afterwards. During the War of the Roses, accusations of treason were frequent and often ill-founded. A provision in the Treason Statute of 1352 stated that an act of treason only had to be imagined to be treasonous. Because it was difficult to determine whether or not a person was imagining treason, words spoken against the current king were taken to be indicative of traitorous thoughts. Similarly, words spoken in favor of a deposed king were taken as treason against the one currently in power. As such, accusations of treason were often used as a means for eliminating political enemies or framing opposition. Sir Thomas Malory was likely familiar with the details of the English Statute of Treasons. Despite not being formally charged with treason, the \\"knight prisoner\\" Malory was convicted of a number of egregious crimes, including theft, poaching, extortion, rape, and attempted murder of the Duke of Buckingham. He was also purportedly involved in the War of the Roses, in favor of the house of Lancaster. Edward Hicks writes in his biography of Malory that \\"though he were involved in the civil strife of Lancaster and York, and dealt with as a traitor by victorious enemies,\\" that Malory not only failed to receive capital punishment, but was permitted to pass his inheritance unto his children. Between 1468 and 1470, four general pardons were granted by Edward IV to incarcerated Lancastrians. Sir Thomas Malory was excluded from all four, and died in prison in 1471, shortly after completing L‚ÄôMorte d‚ÄôArthur. His failure to be outright executed for treason alone, ignoring the various other infractions attributed to him, have led many to believe that Malory may have been a victim of political strong-arming. Punishments of treason =French Punishments of treason= The punishments for those convicted of treason were often brutal and, by modern standards, distastefully contrived, due to the severity of the crime. As an offense against the entire state, traitors were often executed publicly in a manner that would serve as an example, and a warning, for others. Both decapitation and hanging were common execution practices, but a traitor's death \\"could be clearly distinguished by that of other felons by additional penalties of drawing and/ or quartering.\\" Women accused of treason were often burned at the stake, and clerics were often drowned. Not all punishments of treason were considered \\"capital.\\" Other, non-capital punishments included the pillory, the wheel, or the removal of the accused's eyes. One source reads that \\"in 1476, Jean Bon, the would-be assassin of the dauphin Charles, was fortunate not to be punished capitally, though he did have his eyes gouged out.\\" Punishments of treason could also contain a sense of a macabre \\"poetic justice,\\" or a punishment tailored to fit the crime, as in the instance of counterfeiter Jean Jouye who was boiled alive \\"presumably because his crime involved the melting down of coin.\\" Imprisonment for traitors was usually the result of a reduced death sentence, rather than of an initial sentencing, and punishments of banishment were announced when the accused escaped. Punishments for petty treason usually involved the paying of fines in the range of 500‚Äì18,000 livre tournois for \\"breach of safeguard, private war, or violation of a truce,\\" and were payable to the plaintiff. Larger fines were enacted for embezzling large sums and were payable to the crown. =English Punishments of Treason= Medieval English punishments of treason were highly similar to those of the French in terms of both their brutality of their sentencing. Drawing and quartering were common practice to the extent that a quick beheading was considered the privilege of one of noble birth, while a death by hanging, drawing and quartering was reserved for those deemed \\"ignoble.\\" The English would also disembowel or burn the entrails of those executed for treason, in a practice distinct from the French. Those executed for treason in later medieval England would also often have their bodies put on display to symbolize their shamefulness and their \\"excision from the body politic.\\" Treason in Arthurian Texts Treason is a major feature throughout Arthurian romances. Knights constantly commit acts of treason as does Guinevere herself. The treason of Lancelot, Guinevere, Agravain and Mordred eventually destroy Arthur's court and his downfall is caused by the duplicity in his knights. A linking motif throughout a variety of centuries and countries, authors focus on the treasonous destruction of Arthur's court, and the temptation knights face to engage in treason. =Lancelot and Guinevere= Guinevere Queen Guinevere found herself facing accusations of treason several times over the course of recorded Arthurian legend. In Malory's Le Morte d‚ÄôArthur, she is accused first in the \\"Poisoned Apple\\" episode, when at a dinner she holds for some of the knights of the Round Table, one of the knights, Sir Patrise, dies from eating a poisoned apple intended for Gawain. The real culprit is Sir Pinell, but Guinevere is the accused because it she who gathered the knights for the dinner. Guinevere is accused of treason because, as Malory writes, \\"the custome was at that tyme that all manner of shameful deth was called treson.\\" The death is defined as treason because \\"Guinevere's alleged murder of Patryse is a crime against the fellowship, and therefore against Arthur as well.\\" Similarly, in \\"The Knight of the Cart\\" episode, Guinevere is accused of treason by the knight Meliagaunt when he discovers blood on her sheets and assumes that she has spent the night with one of her knights who was captured with her. Meligaunt accuses her of being unfaithful to Arthur and even of \\"hyghe treson.\\" For the French however, the act of adultery would not necessarily have been considered such under the law. In both the case of \\"the Poisoned Apple\\" and the \\"Knight of the Cart,\\" Guinevere is acquitted of the crime through Lancelot dueling to defend her innocence. This trial by combat is used in lieu of an actual refined judicial proceedings, and Lancelot's ability to fight in place of an actual judicial process undermines the legal procedures of the day. It is Lancelot's strength as a knight and not the strength of Arthur's courtly judicial system that ultimately saves Guinevere. Most famous is the exposing of Guinevere's affair with Lancelot that ultimately leads to the dissolution of the Round Table. Guinevere is accused of treason committed with Lancelot and is sentenced to be burned at the stake for the crime. Her treason consists not only of her adulterous affair with Lancelot, but also because she acted as an accessory to Lancelot's escape and homicide of the knights sent to capture him. English Common law would ordinarily have dictated a trial by one's peers in the case of a treason accusation, and as an accessory Guinevere would not have been able to be sentenced until Lancelot was apprehended. However, Malory cites instead an \\"Arthurian treason law of his own invention as his basis for the queen's death sentence.\\" Malory writes that in cases where guilt is \\"manifest and undeniable,\\" that \\"hasty judgment is appropriate.\\" However, this concept of \\"hasty judgment\\" is challenged by Sir Gawain when he protests Arthur's quick sentencing. Because Guinevere can only be considered an accessory to Lancelot's treason, \\"her treasonous guilt rests in the judgment on the guilt of Lancelot.\\" Malory's depiction of the judicial practice also differs from legal proceedings in his time in that Arthur is able to act as both the plaintiff and the judge. Guinevere's adultery would not even have necessarily been considered treasonous by English common law of the time. Consensual adultery was not defined as treason, but \\"sexual violation.\\" Robert Kelly writes, \\"...in western European countries from the twelfth century onwards, adultery and other marital offenses were not criminal, let alone felonious, but under the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts.\\" These courts did not issue the death sentence, and though these courts could try her for her part in the affair, only Lancelot's participation could be construed as treasonous for the violation of the king's wife. Instead Guinevere's treasonous crime can only be defined as her status as an accessory to Lancelot's escape and the killing of several knights. Lancelot Lancelot is accused of treason for both his affair with Guinevere and for the homicide of his fellow knights during his escape from the court. Sir Agravain and Sir Mordred initially accuse him of sexual treason for his long-standing affair with Guinevere, which was defined under the law in Malory's time as \\"if a man violate the king's consort, or the king's eldest unmarried daughter, or the consort of the eldest son and heir of the king.\\" Thus despite the fact that their affair is consensual, Lancelot can be accused of \\"violating\\" Guinevere, and committing treason against Arthur by the act. Lancelot is also accused of treason for the slaying of the knights sent to catch him in his affair. However, it is uncertain whether or not Lancelot could reasonably be accused of treason for the deaths. His guilt lies in whether or not the knights were acting as agents of the king and under his authority. When Agravain and Mordred first raise the charge of adultery against Lancelot, Arthur asks for \\"proof\\" of his guilt before he can take action. However, Arthur does not mean proof by trial, but proof by physical evidence. He states that they have his leave to kill Lancelot, only if he is \\"taken in the dede\\". Agravain and the knights he gathers to try and catch Lancelot and Guinevere together do not physically catch them in any act of adultery, but rather simply know that they are in Guinevere's bedchamber together. Still, they declare this sufficient evidence to pronounce him traitor, and despite announcing that they will take him to Arthur unharmed, instead try to attack him when he opens the door. Lancelot reacts by arming himself and slaying all the knights who come through the door, including Sir Agravain. Lancelot's slayings would not have been defined as treason under the Statute of 1352, which covered \\"the slaying of the royal chancellor, treasurer, or justices, but only when they are sitting and acting in their public capacity.\\" Agravain was only given leave to kill Lancelot if his traitorous guilt was made manifest. Thus he was not acting as an agent of the king, but of his own private volition. =Agravain and Mordred= In Thomas Malory's Morte D‚ÄôArthur, Sir Agravain and Sir Mordred set a trap for Sir Lancelot and Guinevere. Gawain warns Agravain not to reveal the affair, fearing the repercussions of Arthur's knowledge of their affair. Agravain ignores Gawain's warning. Malory represents Agravain and Mordred's betrayal of Gawain as the beginning of the downfall of Arthur's court. Their actions are motivated by jealousy for Lancelot's superiority as a knight. In a departure from earlier writings, Malory features Agravain as the main traitor in this passage instead of Mordred. Malory directs the reader to view \\"Agravain as the agent and Lancelot as the cause for the downfall of the kingdom.\\" Lancelot's adultery is traitorous while simultaneously Agravain and Mordred's reveal of his betrayal are equally, if not more, traitorous. Agravain is killed by Lancelot for his revelation of Lancelot and Guinevere's affair during the escape. Mordred, therefore, becomes the main actor in Arthur's downfall. Mordred commits the worst act of treason by usurping the throne from Arthur. In the final book of Morte D'Arthur, Gawain explicitly refers to Mordred as a \\"false traytoure.\\" In the moment when Mordred takes the throne from Arthur, Mordred is \\"the incarnation of treason.\\" He betrays Arthur as both his knight and his son, committing two acts of treason simultaneously. It is Mordred's evil nature that Malory views as traitorous rather than simply his actions. Mordred is the incarnation of a traitorous knight during the Morte D'Arthur. Malory condemns Mordred's actions and even \\"invents several passages of treason rhetoric to emphasize the wickedness of such an action.\\" While Agravain is a traitor, Mordred's actions are far worse due to his position as both son and knight of Arthur, and he ought swear fealty to Arthur. =Lanval= Marie de France authored \\"Lanval\\" in the 12th century. \\"Lanval\\" is the story of a knight, Lanval, who has a secret fairy lover and rebuffs Guinevere's advances. Guinevere tempts Lanval sexually and he immediately refuses. Her invitation is treason and Lanval's refusal demonstrates his fealty to Arthur. After Lanval refuses, Guinevere accuses Lanval of homosexuality, and homosexuality would have been understood by de France's audience as an act of treason. Sodomy, particularly in homosexual settings, was a charge that mandated burning at the stake in the late Middle Ages. Guinevere's adultery would have brought upon her exactly the same punishment. Sodomy, while a private act, was considered in the late Middle Ages to bring public harm, an act that damaged the whole community. Therefore, sodomy was viewed in the same light as treason during Marie's time. Sodomy accusations in France were so feared that many men openly kept mistresses to ensure no charges were brought against them. Religious figures began aggressively policing sodomy in the 12th century, and many clergymen kept mistresses to rebuff accusations of sodomy. Guinevere's accusation of sodomy is an attempt to ensure her own safety and leverage over Lanval telling anyone about her actions. Both Lanval and Guinevere face the same punishment if their interaction is revealed. Guinevere's threat attempts to ensnare Lanval into her own treasonous acts, threatening to sic a legal system on him that would demand his burning should he engage in sodomy. While Lanval does not commit any treasonous acts, Guinevere has the power to accuse him of treasonous acts should she so desire. Particularly in Marie's time, readers would have been aware of the power an accusation of sodomy had. If Lanval had been convicted of sodomy he would be burned at the stake. =Gawain= Sir Gawain is bloodthirsty and often murderous. His own brother Gareth recognizes his tempestuous relationship with those he does not like, and warns his brother not to act rashly when he is unhappy. These elements of Gawain's character play an important part in the last book of Thomas Malory's Morte D'Arthur. Gawain urges Arthur to avenge his brothers' deaths and \\"pushes Arthur to pursue Lancelot to France and leave Mordred in charge of England.\\" Mordred's rule of England brings about the downfall of Arthur's kingdom and Gawain's vengeful spirit facilitates the end of Arthur's rule. Gawain's actions enable the treasonous acts of Mordred. Gawain is simultaneously a traitor in his unwillingness to reveal the affair to Arthur and his concealment is a violation of Arthur's trust. Gawain and the Green Knight Gawain is duplicitous throughout Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. He is tempted by the wife of Bertilak, a lord who offers his home to Gawain. While Gawain eventually learns the harms of duplicity, Gawain violates \\"his responsibility to honor the host‚Äìguest relationship\\". Gawain keeps the magical girdle, refusing to honor his agreement with Bertilak that he will give everything Lady Bertilak gives to Gawain to the Lord. Instead, Gawain hides the girdle. This treason against the Lord necessitates a physical punishment from the Green Knight before \\"Gawain can return to his proper place in Arthurian society\\". Treason is committed by Gawain against the Lord and therefore he must be physically punished, as one would be during the Middle Ages for crimes of treason. In this case, however, Gawain's punishment is not death but simply a nick on his neck. This permits Gawain to be punished, but not killed, while still demonstrating the importance of honesty. Gawain's instinct is to act duplicitously but he is chastised for these instances.

Zerain summited the mountain solo from Camp III and successfully descended before the series of events that led to the deaths of 11 climbers on 2 August 2008. In his lifetime, he climbed at least 7 eight-thousanders. Alberto Zerain died on 24 June 2017 on Nanga Parbat with his climbing partner, , while on an expedition.  The 2008 K2 Disaster  During the 2008 K2 Disaster, Alberto Zerain was on a solo expedition. Zerain lacked the resources that other expeditions had. In order to secure a place on the mountain, he made a deal with a Sirdar. He agreed to work as a porter to earn his keep. In return, he was given a site for his tent. He worked hard side-by-side with native mountain workers. Over the course of the expedition, he earned the respect of the locals, which said they had never seen a westerner climb like a Sherpa. While he met with other teams when they were planning the duty roster for fixed lines, he decided to climb alone straight from Camp III. He said he immediately noticed that other climbers were suffering from Summit Fever, and he chose to make the assault alone while the others were still discussing their problem with fixed ropes. He summited K2 on August 1, 2008. He was the first climber to reach the summit that day. He also descended successfully and was the first climber to do so, only hours before the 2008 K2 disaster.K2 Tragedy (Alberto Zerain section), The Guardian, During that expedition, 11 climbers would die after a series of ice falls cut their fixed ropes, stranding them above the death zone.

Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The role of the Italian father Tony was played by Frank H. Crane. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. In the role of Tony's wife was Anna Rosemond, who was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Marie Eline, played the role of Tony's son, was concealed in masculine make up and black hair for the role of the Italian boy. The Moving Picture World said, \\"[m]aybe you'd never recognize her if we did not tip you off. Don't pass the tip to others in your place, but see if their little favorite doesn't fool them completely in her masculine makeup.\\" Other members of the cast have not been identified.  Release and reception  The single-reel drama, approximately 1000 feet long, was released on June 7, 1910. This production was the first Tuesday release in the Thanhouser \\"two a week\\" releases. The production was advertised as a \\"A powerful, pathetic, pretty story of life in Little Italy.\\" The Moving Picture World contained a brief article that used the term \\"The Thanhouser Kid\\" to describe Marie Eline; it was the origin of the nickname for Eline. The film had a wide national release: it was advertised by theaters in Kansas, Indiana, Texas, and Pennsylvania. In 1987, the film was erroneously claimed to be an adaptation of Charles Dickens serial novel Little Dorrit by H. Philip Bolton in Novels on Stage - Dickens dramatized. Bolton writes, \\"[t]he first film in some sense from the novel - albeit indirectly - would appear to have been a \\"Two Roses\\" movie produced in 1910 by Thanhouser.\\" A mostly complete print of the film survives and has been preserved in its 35 mm state by the Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum f√ºr Film und Fernsehen in Berlin. The surviving print had only a French language title card \\"Les Deux Roses\\" and was devoid of intertitles. New German intertitles were added by Urte Alfs and Anke Mebold of the Deutsches Filminstitut based on the published synopsis from The Moving Picture World. The restored work uses an original music composition composed and performed by G√ºnter A. Buchwald. Ned Thanhouser made available an English language translation of the new German intertitles . The film is also released as part of a two-disc DVD set, Screening the Poor, published in the Edition Filmmuseum Series.

Both are professional full-frame cameras with 50.6-megapixel sensors, the highest of any full-frame camera at the time of announcement. The only difference between the two models is that the sensor of the \\"R\\" version includes an optical filter that cancels out the effects of a standard optical low-pass filter. This distinction is roughly similar to that between Nikon's now-replaced D800 and D800E (with the E having a self-cancelling filter). Canon stated that both the 5DS and 5DS R will not replace the older EOS 5D Mark III, so therefore both the 5DS and 5DS R will have their new positions in Canon's DSLR camera lineup. At the time of announcement, estimated prices were US$3,699.00 and US$3,899.00 (EOS 5DS and EOS 5DS R), with announced date of availability, through authorized Canon retailers, in June 2015. Despite the record-high pixel count and related storage and processing power, these cameras do not shoot 4K video or high frame rate 1080p video.

It is very similar to the 750D, but adds the following features: * An LCD information display on top of the body, a feature never before available in the EOS xxxD/Rebel digital line. The last previous consumer-level body with an LCD display was the 35mm film-era EOS 3000N/Rebel XS N. * A quick control dial on the rear of the body, also a first for the xxxD/Rebel digital line. * Servo AF (autofocus) in live view mode, allowing for continuous autofocus during shooting bursts. (The 750D/T6i only supports Servo AF when using the optical viewfinder.) Both 750D and 760D camera uses advance Hybrid CMOS AF III sensor and a 19-point AF phase module sensor, The Hybrid Sensor AF system gets activated when a users switch to live view shooting or records a video. All of the current Canon EF Lenses are compatible with the Canon latest Hybrid AF sensor and will do AF perfectly without an issue. Predecessor Comparison The Canon EOS 750D (Rebel T6i) is the successor to the EOS 700D (Rebel T5i) with the following improvements. * Higher Image Resolution: The T5i has a resolution of 17.9 megapixels, whereas the T6i provides 24 MP. * More AF- Points: 19 vs 9 AF-Points. * Lighter Body: The T6i is slightly lighter (4 percent) than the T5i. *Built-in Wi-Fi: The T5i doesn't have built-in Wi-Fi, whereas the T6i features both Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication) technology allow the camera to connect to a compatible device to share images or enable remote control of the camera.  Sensor issues  On May 8, 2015, Canon USA confirmed a sensor issue on some 750D and 760D cameras which resulted in the appearance of dark circular patterns on the captured image under certain shooting conditions. Canon provided instructions on how to identify potentially affected cameras and offered free repair to any affected camera. The Hybrid CMOS AF III system is also prone to cause 'banding' - seven pairs of horizontal lines across the image which are particularly noticeable when the image is processed aggressively, this is particularly noticeable in astrophotography. Canon stated \\"Canon is able to reproduce the stripes. The stripes will appear in those areas where the pixels for the AF are located. This is causing a lower density of image pixels in those areas. This not a lack of quality, since the effect will be seen only if heavy post-processing is applied.\\"  References   External links  *http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/slrs/canon_eos750d/specifications *https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200031/http://www.cameracomparisonreview.com/2015/02/06/the- eos-rebel-t6s760d-and-rebel-t6i750d-arrived-with-magnificent-specs/ 750D ","title":"Canon EOS 750D"},{"id":"45323424","text":"The Canon EOS M3 is a digital mirrorless camera announced by Canon on February 6, 2015.

This aphid has a Holarctic distribution and is known from Europe, Asia, North America and Argentina. Description Cinara confinis is a dark-coloured aphid growing to a maximum length of about . The head and thorax are dark brown with yellowish-grey antennae and dark brown-ringed or blackish limbs. The abdomen is greenish- black or dark brown with two longitudinal rows of shining black spots and specks of wax in transverse rows. The cornicles (upright tubes found on the last abdominal segment) are prominent and dark-coloured. Hosts Cinara confinis has been found feeding on species of fir (Abies), and also on cedar (Cedrus), spruce (Picea) and juniper (Juniperus). It has a Holarctic distribution and is found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, in North America and Argentina. Fir trees were introduced into the United Kingdom in the 17th century, and C. confinis may have been introduced at the same time. Biology In Maine, wingless females known as fundatrices hatch out of over- wintering eggs in mid-May, at the base of buds near the top of small trees. Colonies form just below the first whorl of shoots and the reproduction at first is parthenogenetic and viviparous with the offspring being wingless. If disturbed, adults drop to the ground but nymphs move rapidly away on the trunk. Colonies are transitory, and by mid-June, most colonies are at the base of trees, at the root collar or on the roots. Some winged females then occur and colonies develop on the roots and root collars of nearby trees. By October, winged males are also produced, and they and winged females move to near the top of the trees where eggs are laid in crevices in the bark. Colonies of this aphid are often attended by ants such as the southern wood ant (Formica rufa) which feed on the honeydew produced by the aphids. Sometimes the ants construct earth galleries to enclose the aphid colony. The ants also protect the aphids from parasitic wasps; however, some aphids are still parasitized, and become blackish, mummified husks. The wasp Pauesia grossa, found in Central Europe, is probably restricted to using Cinara confinis as a host in which to lay eggs.

An ex√≥tico and referred to by using feminine pronouns, she is a former Open the Brave Gate Champion and Open the Owarai Gate Champion. Professional wrestling career =Dragon Gate= Early years (2011‚Äì2013) Watanabe trained for his professional wrestling career in the Japanese promotion Dragon Gate's wrestling school called \\"Dragon Gate Nex\\" and made his debut on January 26, 2011 at Dragon Gate Nex's Sanctuary.71 show in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan, wrestling to a draw against fellow trainee, and future stable mate, Eita Kobayashi. He later \\"graduated\\" to the main Dragon Gate shows as a low ranking rookie. On April 19, 2012, Watanabe would become the third incarnation of Super Shenlong, he would also form -akatsuki- along Chihiro Tominaga, Shingo Takagi and Yamato. On May 6, -akatsuki- defeated Mad Blankey in an eight-man tag team match. Super Shenlong teamed up with Takagi and Yamato to participate in 2012's Summer Adventure Tag League with their only win going against Mad Blankey's Cyber Kong, Kzy and Mondai Ryu. On August 1, 2013, -akatsuki- was forced to disband, after losing to Mad Blankey in a five-on-four tag team match. Also part of the stipulation, Super Shenlong was forced to unmask revealing his true identity. During the Summer Adventure Tag League, Naruki Doi turned on Masato Yoshino, meaning that Watanabe would fill Doi's spot in the tournament. Surprisingly, the team managed to defeat Don Fujii and Masaaki Mochizuki. Millennials (2014‚Äì2015) No longer wanting to hide his true feelings, Watanabe joined the Millennials and renamed herself Yosuke‚ô•Santa Maria, stating that she now used feminine pronouns. In keeping with the Millennials lucha libre style, Santa Maria is an ex√≥tico, a person who fights in drag, incorporating dancing, feminine costumes and outrageous moves such as Sky‚ô•Love and Zona Rosa. On February 22, 2014, Santa Maria debuted for Dragon Gate USA losing to Caleb Konley, the following night she defeated Ethan Page. On March 1, Santa Maria had her first championship match against Genki Horiguchi H.A.Gee.Mee!! for the Open the Brave Gate Championship, which she lost.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=107894 On November 2, Santa Maria teamed with the unaffiliated \\"Mr. High Tension\\" Kotoka and Yuga Hayashi to defeat Don Fujii, Stalker Ichikawa and Super Shisa, teasing their eventual joining. Four days later, the Millennials defeated Team Veteran Returns forcing them to disband, had the Millennials lost they would have been deported. On November 30, Santa Maria was pinned during a hair vs hair match. Santa Maria was forced into the chair for her haircut and despite her rampant protests, Fujii said that the rules were the rules, and as such the show has to end with Maria having her head shaved. However, he had a change of heart after seeing how dejected Santa Maria was, and after offering to cut someone else's hair, decided to cut his own hair in an act he considered tanpatsushiki. Following Flamita vacating the Open the Brave Gate Championship and abandoning the Millennials, Santa Maria entered a tournament to crown a new winner but on January 1, 2015, she lost to Dr. Muscle in the first round. On February 4, Santa Maria defeated Jimmy Kanda and via fan support won the Open the Owarai Gate Championship, his first professional wrestling title. She lost the title to Akira Tozawa on March 29, 2015. On August 6, 2015, Millennials lost a three-way match and were as a result forced to disband. Despite this, Watanabe retained the Yosuke‚ô•Santa Maria gimmick. Tribe Vanguard (2016‚Äì2019) On March 5, 2016, Santa Maria defeated Kotoka to win the Open the Brave Gate Championship. On May 28, Santa Maria, along with BxB Hulk, Yamato, and Kzy, formed a new unit named Tribe Vanguard. On July 24, Santa Maria lost the Open the Brave Gate Championship to her former Millennials stablemate, Eita.

Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to field. Kumar Sangakkara (SL) moved into second place in the list of players with the most runs in ODI matches, overtaking Ricky Ponting (Aus). =Australia vs England= Australia were put in to bat by England who won the toss. After opener Aaron Finch was dropped in the first over without having scored, Australia raced away to 52, before David Warner and Shane Watson were dismissed off consecutive balls in the eighth over. In the 11th over, the dismissal of Steve Smith left Australia at 70/3. Captain George Bailey then joined Finch and the two added 146 runs in 26 overs for the fourth wicket. Finch was run out for 135 and soon Bailey was also sent back for 55. Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh then put on 53 runs in 7 overs for the sixth wicket before Marsh fell and the Australian score read 281/6 in the 46th over. Brad Haddin came into bat at 9 and shared a partnership of 61 runs off just 27 balls with Maxwell. In the final over of the innings, Steven Finn removed Haddin for a 14-ball 31 and Maxwell for a 40-ball 66 off consecutive balls. Finn completed the hat-trick getting the wicket of Mitchell Johnson off the final ball, and Australia finished at 342/9. England's chase started with Mitchell Starc breaking the opening stand of 25, following which Marsh picked the next five wickets. England were reduced to 92/6, before James Taylor and Chris Woakes steadied the innings with a 92-run partnership. After Woakes fell for 37, Australia picked two more wickets off consecutive overs. From 195/9, England could add 36 runs for the last wicket before a controversial run out ended their innings. Taylor remained unbeaten on 98 as Australia secured a 111-run victory. Finch won the Man of the Match award for his knock. =New Zealand vs Scotland= New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum won the toss and put Scotland in to bat.

New Zealand fast bowler Tim Southee picked up 7/33 in his 9 overs, which was the third-best haul in World Cup history. Joe Root, who scored 46, was the only England batsman to show some resilience. New Zealand's chase got off to a brisk start, mainly due to their captain Brendon McCullum who scored the fastest World Cup fifty reaching the landmark in just 18 balls. New Zealand had made 105 in 7 overs without losing a wicket. McCullum was dismissed off the first ball of the eighth over for 77, and the other opener, Martin Guptill also fell to the bowling of Chris Woakes in the tenth over.

Jayawardene was awarded the Man of the Match for his innings of 100 from 120 balls. =England vs Scotland= =Afghanistan vs Scotland= =Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka= =New Zealand vs Australia= Australian captain Michael Clarke won the toss and elected to bat first. Australia got off to a brisk start, putting up 48/1 at the end of the first five overs. However, Shane Watson and David Warner were dismissed off consecutive balls with the score at 80. This triggered a collapse, with Trent Boult picking up five wickets in the first three overs of his second spell. Australia were left struggling at 106/9 at the end of 22 overs, before Brad Haddin and Pat Cummins put on 45 runs for the 10th wicket to take the Australian total to 151. New Zealand started off rapidly in their chase, thanks to a 21-ball fifty from their captain Brendon McCullum who took his team to 72/1 after 7 overs. Soon after, Australia fought back picking up three wickets in five deliveries. New Zealand began rebuilding with a 52-run partnership between Kane Williamson and Corey Anderson. The partnership was broken when Anderson was dismissed by Glenn Maxwell and the score read 131/5. In the next three overs, Mitchell Starc and Cummins took four more wickets between them, leaving New Zealand at 146/9 in 23 overs. With 6 runs needed from 27 overs, Williamson struck a six off the bowling of Cummins to give New Zealand a memorable one-wicket victory.

New Zealand also won the Chappell‚ÄìHadlee Trophy as a result of this win. =England vs Sri Lanka= England captain Eoin Morgan won the toss and elected for his side to bat first. The England openers started solidly, but they were reduced from 62/0 in the 10th over to 101/3 in the 21st. Joe Root and Morgan added 60 runs for the fourth wicket before the dismissal of Morgan. The fifth wicket partnership between Root and James Taylor yielded 98 runs in 11 overs. Taylor fell for 25, following which Root was also dismissed for a 108-ball 121. England were 265/6 in the 47th over, before Jos Buttler struck an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls to take the total to 309/6 at the end of 50 overs. Sri Lankan innings began with Lahiru Thirimanne being dropped on 3. His opening partner Tillakaratne Dilshan was out for 44 immediately after their partnership had reached 100 runs. Kumar Sangakkara joined Thirimanne and the left-hand duo punished the England bowlers with each of the batsmen making hundreds. Thirimanne struck a six off the third ball of the 48th over to complete an emphatic 9-wicket victory. Thirimanne remained unbeaten on a 143-ball 139, while Sangakkara won the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 117 off just 86 balls. =Australia vs Afghanistan= Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi won the toss and put Australia in to bat. After losing the wicket of Aaron Finch in the third over, Australia put on a 260-run second wicket partnership between David Warner and Steve Smith, before Warner was dismissed for 178 off 133 balls. Smith and Glenn Maxwell then shared 65 runs in 32 balls for the third wicket before Smith fell five runs short of a hundred. Maxwell continued scoring at a brisk rate, but, in the 48th over, he was dismissed for a 39-ball 88. Brad Haddin scored an unbeaten 20 off 9 balls towards the end of the innings to push the Australian total to 417/6 at the end of their 50 overs, which was the highest- ever total in a World Cup match. Afghanistan's chase was dented at regular intervals by the Australian fast bowlers. Former Afghan captain Nawroz Mangal top-scored for his team with 33 and no other batsman could go past 25. Mitchell Johnson picked up four wickets for Australia as Afghanistan were bowled out for 142 in 37.3 overs. This gave Australia a 275-run victory, the largest victory in terms of runs in a World Cup match. =Bangladesh vs Scotland= =New Zealand vs Afghanistan= =Australia vs Sri Lanka= Australian captain Michael Clarke won the toss and elected to bat.

Witbooi was born in Pella in South Africa in 1780 where several small clans had moved from Cape Town in the second half of the 18th century. His father, Gamab, and his mother, U-eis, belonged to different tribes. At the time of their marriage the respective tribal councils agreed to merge into one larger group and decided that Gamab's and U-eis' first-born son should assume the chieftaincy of the united clan. Thus when Kido came of age in 1805, the councils made him leader of the «ÄKhowesin. Under his leadership the clan trekked first to Griqualand and then, around 1810, across the Oranje to Namaqualand in South-West Africa. Around 1850 Witbooi and his clan had been invited by Jonker Afrikaner to travel to Windhoek. Their fellow Nama chiefs feared that an alliance of Jonker Afrikaner and Kido Witbooi, both admired for their intelligence, would diminish their own influence in South-West Africa. «ÅHawoben chief Hendrik Hendricks sent a message to chief «ÅOaseb of the Khai«Åkhaun asking him to stop Kido. Yet when «ÅOaseb replied, nobody in the «ÅHawoben clan could read. Kido passed both territories undisturbed and reached Khaxa-ts√ªs in 1863, which he renamed Gibeon.

She was taken captive in August 2013 in Aleppo, Syria, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital. Media had long reported that a 26-year-old American aid worker was being held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) without naming her, at her family's request. In 2015, she was killed in uncertain circumstances.  Early life, activism and humanitarian aid  Mueller was a native of Prescott, Arizona. After graduating from Tri-City College Prep High School in 2007, she attended Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Mueller was a devout Christian.

Although Mueller had been working with the international aid agency Support to Life in Turkey, this was not a work-related trip for Mueller. Doctors Without Borders staff were \\"flabbergasted\\" at Mueller's arrival, fearing for her safety, as Syria was dangerous for international aid workers and in the midst of a civil war. The following day, Doctors Without Borders staff tried to drive Mueller to a bus station so that she could travel back to Turkey.Callimachi, Rukmini; Schmitt, Eric Schmitt (February 10, 2015).

The car was ambushed, however, and both Mueller and the Syrian man were abducted by ISIS. The Syrian man was later freed.  Captivity and unsuccessful rescue attempt  The U.S. military and Mueller's family attempted several times to rescue Mueller, devoting considerable resources to the search.Ralph Ellis, 'Enormous resources' on rescue attempt for Kayla Mueller, Obama says , CNN (February 12, 2015). In July 2014, U.S. special operations forces (from Delta Force and 75th Ranger Regiment) raided an abandoned oil refinery near Raqqa in an unsuccessful attempt to find reporter James Foley (whom ISIL later murdered) and other hostages. The commandos found evidence that the hostages had recently been held there, finding writing on the cell walls and hair believed to be Mueller's, but the refinery was empty.Karen DeYoung, The anatomy of a failed hostage rescue deep in Islamic State territory , Washington Post (February 14, 2015).\\"No plans to save Kayla Mueller, Pentagon says\\" , Politico.com; accessed August 14, 2015. A Mueller family spokesman said that Mueller's parents \\"often communicated with the White House in trying to free their daughter.\\" In the summer 2014, as other options were exhausted, Mueller's parents asked President Obama in a letter to consider trading Mueller for Aafia Siddiqui, a convicted terrorist serving 86 years in federal prison; Siddiqui's release has been a long-sought demand of ISIS and al-Qaeda.Shane Harris, Kayla Mueller's Family Asked U.S. to Give ISIS 'Lady al Qaeda': When all other options were exhausted, Kayla Mueller‚Äôs family tried to persuade Obama to free a terrorist who wanted to weaponize Ebola , Daily Beast (February 11, 2015). The proposed exchange did not take place; the Obama administration had also rejected demands from other militant groups to exchange Siddiqui. Catherine Herridge of Fox News reported via anonymous sources that the location of Mueller and other American hostages was known by the White House in May 2014. However, a decision regarding a rescue mission was not made for seven weeks, because the White House had asked for further intelligence to be obtained. By that time, the hostages had been dispersed.. In August 2015, the New York Times reported that Mueller had been forced into marriage\\"Islamic State Leader Raped American Hostage, US Finds\\", nytimes.com, August 14, 2015. to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the caliph of ISIL, who raped her repeatedly.Associated Press, \\"Islamic State leader reportedly raped American hostage\\", Fox News Online, August 14, 2015. She had also been tortured. It had also been reported in May 2015 that Mueller was a \\"personal captive\\" of Abu Sayyaf. In August 2015, ABC News reported that Abu Sayyaf's widow, Umm Sayyaf, had confirmed that al-Baghdadi had been Mueller's primary abuser. Fellow captives who were released or escaped reported Mueller's strength and compassion. She was concerned for the safety of others, even intentionally passing up an escape attempt to give other women a better chance at freedom. After months of prolonged torture and abuse, ISIS members, who are known for their persecution of Christians, attempted to use her as propaganda by claiming she had abandoned the Christian faith in front of other prisoners who were men, but she denied it. Daniel Rye Ottosen, a Danish freelance photographer and fellow captive, said that the men in the room \\"...were impressed by the strength that she showed in front of us. That was very clear.\\"  Death  On February 6, 2015, a media account affiliated with ISIS released a statement claiming that a female American hostage held by the group was killed by one of around a dozen Jordanian airstrikes in Raqqa. The statement came just days after the release of a video showing the burning alive of a Jordanian fighter pilot, Muath al-Kasasbeh, by ISIS and the subsequent execution of Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi and other prisoners of Jordan. The statement was later translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, identifying the hostage as Mueller. Other reports claimed Mueller was killed in an American airstrike. Mueller had been a hostage of ISIS for 18 months. As part of the statement, ISIS published a photo of a damaged building, alleging that Mueller had been killed in a Jordanian airstrike in the building, where she had been left alone with no guards, but no proof of death was provided. The Pentagon agreed the building was one hit in the bombings, but disputed that Mueller or any other civilian had been inside at the time. The site had been bombed by the coalition twice before, and was targeted again because ISIS soldiers sometimes return to bombed sites, thinking the coalition would not bomb those sites again, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. After this, Mueller's name was released by American and other media with the family's consent. On February 10, 2015, Mueller's family announced ISIS had confirmed her death to them in an e-mail, with three photographs of her dead body, bruised on the face and wearing a black hijab.\\"Proof of Death in Hand, Family Honors Hostage\\" , nytimes.com, February 11, 2015. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said this message was authenticated by the intelligence community. On August 24, 2016, ABC News reported that Doctors Without Borders had declined to help negotiate her release. Doctors without Borders then issued their version of the story in a statement (since deleted but archived) to the effect that they felt constrained in their available actions by the complexities of the larger situation and their general lack of expertise in hostage negotiation. Shortly after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death in October 2019, new speculations arose that al-Baghdadi may have had her executed.  Legal proceedings  On February 8, 2016, Umm Sayyaf was charged by American prosecutors in Virginia with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization that resulted in a person's death. The federal charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. She remains in Iraqi custody on terrorism-related charges. In October 2020, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were extradited to the US and charged in Kayla's murder.https://www.abc15.com/news/national/isis-members-linked-to-arizonas- kayla-muller-in-fbi-custody  Reactions  = Family = Carl Mueller speaking at a rally for Donald Trump in Arizona, October 2016. Mueller's parents reportedly implored ISIS to contact them, as they hoped their daughter might still be alive. ‚ÄúWe have sent you a private message and ask that you respond to us privately,‚Äù Carl and Marsha Mueller said in a statement. They said they had not talked to the media, as ISIS warned them not to. Later, in an interview on The Today Show, Carl Mueller expressed his frustration with the Obama administration over the way it conducted negotiations with their daughter's captors, and their policy of not paying ransom money for hostages‚Äîeven though U.S. citizens living abroad are required to pay taxes to the U.S. ‚ÄùWe understand the policy about not paying ransom, but on the other hand, any parents out there would understand that you would want anything and everything done to bring your child home,‚Äù Carl Mueller said. ‚ÄúAnd we tried, and we asked. But they put policy in front of American citizens' lives. And it didn‚Äôt get it changed.‚Äù = Church = Kayla Mueller was a member of an ecumenical Christian campus ministry, United Christian Ministries, which held ties to the Presbyterian Church. The denomination stated: ‚ÄúEach of us is called in our own way to make the world a better place and manifest the love of Christ to those around us. Kayla did that in a very profound and tangible way, and my hope is that she inspires others to alleviate suffering in the world and in their own communities.‚Äù Hare Krishna Food For Life, for which Mueller was an active volunteer, stated: ‚ÄúOur prayers go out to her family and friends, a wonderful soul who was making a real difference in many people‚Äôs lives. Sure she has gone on to a better life in the spiritual realm.‚Äùhttps://iskconnews.org/isis-hostage-and-food-for-life-volunteer-kayla- mueller-is-killed,4800/ = Government = An American official cautioned that without proof of Mueller's death, the statement by ISIS could be a ploy to cause the Jordanians and the rest of the American-led coalition to refrain from any heavier airstrikes. Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh called ISIS's claim \\"an old and sick trick\\" on Twitter. \\"So they behead innocent #US #UK & Japan hostages & BURN a brave #Jordan pilot ALIVE & now a hostage is killed by an airstrike? Sure! Sick!\\", he said. He further tweeted: \\"An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.\\" Later upon confirmation of Mueller's death he tweeted: \\"Saddened & angered to hear news confirming killing of #US hostage #kaylaMueller. Yet another ugly example of these terrorists' brutality.\\" After many Western news outlets cast doubt on the claim of the hostage death and the extremists' ability to identify Jordanian and U.S.-made F-16s flying at high altitudes, Jordan dismissed the claim of a killed hostage as an ISIS publicity stunt and a lie, as the group is known for its propaganda techniques. After Mueller's family confirmed her death, President Obama said \\"[Mueller] represents what is best about America, and expressed her deep pride in the freedoms that we Americans enjoy, and that so many others strive for around the world.\\" United States Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement saying \\"ISIS, and ISIS alone, is the reason Kayla is gone.\\" The Pentagon declined to investigate whether Mueller was killed by the coalition airstrike. Policy dictates that the U.S. only investigates reports of civilian casualties when they come from a \\"credible source\\", which ISIS is not.U.S. Won't Investigate ISIS Hostage's Death , thedailybeast.com; accessed February 15, 2015. = Media = In February 2015, Charlotte Alter of TIME described Kayla Mueller as an ideal role model for Millennials, citing her selfless desire to end suffering, her activism, and her humanitarian aid work, and praising her desire not to be seen, but to genuinely help people. According to Alter, \\"Mueller represented the best qualities of the millennial generationour idealism, our optimism, and our love of our familieswithout the troublesome ones.\\" = Recognition = In October 2015, Mueller became the first person to be posthumously inducted into Northern Arizona University's college of Social and Behavioral Sciences Hall of Fame. She was recognized as an outstanding alumna for her humanitarian aid work. The military operation that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on October 27, 2019 was code-named after Kayla Mueller, according to several sources. On February 4, 2020, during the 2020 State of the Union Address, President Donald Trump personally recognized Mueller as part of his discussion of tackling ISIS insurgent forces and the military operations directed at taking down prominent members under his administration, directly referencing the Barisha raid in which ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed. During this recognition, he also directly referenced Mueller's parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, being in attendance at the address. Several aspects of Mueller's life were mentioned, including her college education, devotion to humanitarian aid, and personal faith, as well as her capture, torture and eventual death at the hands of ISIS terrorists. Carl and Marsha Mueller spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, where they described their daughter's ordeal and praised the Trump administration's coordination of the raid that led to the killing of al-Baghdadi.

The play is a satirical allegory about an attempt to create a utopian society on a Polynesian island that has recently emerged from the sea. The play divided critics. Edmund Wilson described it as Shaw's only \\"silly play\\", in which the action seems to purely whimsical. In contrast, Frederick McDowell wrote that Shaw had created \\"a symbolic fable\\" to expound his own \\"deeply felt ideas\\".Daniel J. Leary \\"About Nothing in Shaw's The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles\\", Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 24, No. 2 (May, 1972), pp. 139-148. The preface, in which Shaw appears to advocate the killing of useless individuals in a future society, has been considered to be distasteful by several commentators. Creation Shaw wrote the play in 1934, originally entitling it \\"the End of the Simpleton\\". Shaw added a note to his secretary suggesting that \\"the final title...will probably be The Unexpected Isles or something like that.\\" It was first produced by the Theatre Guild of New York at the Guild Theatre on February 18, 1935, directed by Romney Brent. A production in England followed at the Malvern Festival, July 29, 1935. Plot East Asian princess Prola and a priest Pra, decide to join with two European couples in a sexually communal \\"superfamily\\" to create a utopian community on an uninhabited island that has just emerged from the sea in an obscure outpost of the British Empire. They produce two mixed-race children, Maya and Vashti, who are intended to blend the qualities of the East and the West. The children have ideal refined sensibilities, but lack common sense. Issie, a British clergyman, arrives on the island, dropped off by pirates. He is drawn into its idiosyncratic mores, eventually enthusiastically embracing the polygamous lifestyle by mating with Maya and Vashti and producing two children. This causes scandal in Britain, leading to a proposed invasion of the island to impose conventional morality. However, English politicians decide that the best course is for England to declare its own independence from the British Empire. At this point the Angel of the Lord appears, declares that the Last Judgement has come, and makes most of the characters disappear because they are useless. News arrives from Britain that large numbers of British politicians have also disappeared, along with most doctors. Prola and Pra are left alone. Prola says they will begin anew to embrace the future and the force of life itself, since now the whole world is an \\"unexpected isle\\". Preface The play was published along with The Six of Calais and The Millionairess in 1936. The trio was later given the overall title \\"Plays Extravagant\\". The published version included a preface in which Shaw appeared to advocate the efficient mass killing of \\"useless\\" persons. Shaw speaks about the creation of the Cheka in the Soviet Union, which he asserts was necessary to deal with counter-revolutionaries and eliminate \\"lazy\\" individuals. He says that distaste for the suffering involved in punishments can be overcome by devising efficient and painless deaths for people who are of no use to the community: Shaw says he introduced the fantasy of a Day of Judgement as a dramatic way of reimagining the logic of what has been happening in \\"the great Russian change, or any of the actual political changes which threaten to raise it in the National-Socialist and Fascist countries, and to go back to the old vision of a day of reckoning by divine justice for all mankind.\\" Reception Critics at both the New York and London premieres generally expressed \\"confusion and disconcertment\\" at the work.Archibald Henderson, George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century, Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p.640 Shaw was not pleased. In a booklet for the Malvern production, he wrote: Shaw explained the play as a satire on spiritual utopianism. According to Bernard F. Dukore, in the Shavian fantasy of judgement \\"angels proclaim the world to belong to those who think, plan, and work for its betterment.\\"Bernard F. Dukore, Bernard Shaw, Playwright: Aspects of Shavian Drama: University of Missouri Press, Columbia, MO. 1973, p.285. Erich Strauss considered the play to be evidence of Shaw's decline. He objected to \\"the use of allegorical figures. They are 'the four lovely phantasms who embody all the artistic, romantic and military ideals of our cultured suburbs,' to wit, 'Love, Pride, Heroism and Empire.\\"E. Strauss, Bernard Shaw: Art and Socialism, p. 112 Other critics have had a more favourable view. Daniel J. Leary saw the play as an anticipation of the theatre of the absurd, and as an allegory about the embrace of nothingness. Rodelle Weintraub sees it as a Freudian \\"dream play\\".Rodelle Weintraub, \\"Bernard Shaw's Fantasy Island\\", Shaw, Vol. 17, Shaw and Science Fiction, (1997), pp. 97-105. =Alleged politics= The politics allegedly implied by the play have come in for severe criticism, though this may be influenced as much by the preface than the play itself.Michael Holroyd, \\"Belligerent romantic\\", The Guardian, Saturday 16 December 2000. In 1936, the reviewer of the published version in the Times Literary Supplement wrote that, \\"In all the play and preface nothing has been said but that at the price of bloody tyranny we might achieve a set of social values different from those now held.\\"T. F. Evans (ed), George Bernard Shaw: the Critical Heritage, Routledge, 2013, p.346. Homer E. Woodbridge was repelled by the idea that \\"useless\\" people should be identified and eliminated: Shaw's biographer Michael Holroyd notes that when the play was revived in the 1990s many critics expressed distaste, with Charles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph claiming to be \\"nauseated\\" after reading the preface. Benedict Nightingale in The Times said that it communicated \\"intellectual poison and death\\" and Michael Coveney in The Observer stated \\"No wonder the play went down well in Nazi Germany\\". Holroyd says that though the play was performed in Germany at the time, it was not a major success.

With a political career spanning 12 years, Ibrahim has both occupied elected offices and political appointments. Early life and education Ibrahim was born in Maiduguri on April 13, 1971 to (late) Senator Ibrahim Jalo-Waziri and Hajiya Adama Modibbo. His father was Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1960 to 1966,The Europa World Year Book 1965 and served as a senator between 1979 and 1983. An indigene of Gombe Local Government in Gombe State, Ibrahim's education began in 1978 at the Tudun Wada Primary School, Gombe. In 1983, he proceeded to the Government Science Secondary School (also in Gombe), where he earned his SSCE certificate in 1988. In 1989, he enrolled in the Federal College of Education, Gombe, and collected an NCE degree in Business Education in 1993. Studying further, between 1995-2000, he was a student at the Ahmadu Bello University, from where he earned a bachelor's degree in Business Education. In 2005, he secured an MBA (Financial Management) from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi. Career Upon graduation from Ahmadu Bello University in 2000, Ibrahim participated in the mandatory National Youth Service Corps (2000‚Äì2001), during which the Central Insurance Company (CICO), Jos, was his designated place of primary assignment. In 2003, Ibrahim was appointed Secretary of the State Independent Electoral Commission, Gombe. He also got a political appointment as a Special Adviser to the then Governor of Gombe State, Danjuma Goje, in the same year. In 2004, he threw his hat in the ring for the chairmanship of Gombe Local Government - an election which he won ‚Äì and occupied this position until 2007. In 2007, the executive bodies of local governments was dissolved; yet, he emerged as the caretaker chairman and in 2008, he was officially re-elected as the executive chairman of Gombe Local Government Area. During his second tenure, Ibrahim was elected National President of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), a body encompassing all chairmen of the 774 Local Government Areas across Nigeria. In 2011, he contested to represent the Gombe/Kwami/Funakaye Federal Constituency at the Federal House of Representatives, but lost. In 2014, he emerged as the National Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress. Tenure as APC Youth Leader Ibrahim's emergence as the APC National Youth Leader was marked with controversy, as stories allegedly sponsored by the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cast doubt on his age. This was, however, settled swiftly by the APC and youth groups within the party rallied round him to lend their support. As youth leader of the APC, Ibrahim has been able to harmonize the APC youth structure by creating an effective working relationship between youth leaders as contained within the official party structure, and affiliated youth groups with the mandate of mobilizing young Nigerians for the party. He is also a member of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, where he heads the youth directorate and works closely with other APC youth leaders such as Ismail Ahmed, Sesan Sobande, Damilola Elemo and Rinsola Abiola.

It is the main headwater of the Lhasa River. The river flows past Reting Monastery, founded in 1056. The terrain is geologically complex, with deeply eroded and faulted rocks that reflect the results of the collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. Course The Reting Tsangpo originates in the Chenthangula Mountains at an elevation of about , and flows southwest. It has an average gradient of about 11 feet per mile (2.1 meters per kilometer). In one section the Reting Tsangpo runs through a deep canyon. The river flows past the Reting Monastery. The monastery was founded in 1056 by Dromt√∂n Gyelwai Jungne, a pupil of the Indian master Ati≈õa. The monastery is from the mouth of the river. The Lhasa River (or Kyi River) forms where the Reting Tsangpo is joined by two smaller rivers, the Phak Chu and the Phongdolha Chu which flows from Damxung County. The river is spanned by a large metal suspension bridge just above the juncture. The combined length of the Reting Tsangpo and the Lhasa River is about . The river is said to excellent for kayaking and white water rafting, although as of 2015 it had been visited by few tourists interested in these sports. Geology The Reting Tsangpo flows through the east central region of Tibet's Eocene block. The average elevation of the region is about . The Tsangpo Suture is to the south and the northwest extension of the Ailao Shan Fault is to the north. Rocks in this region include sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic into which granite has intruded during the Cretaceous. The rocks have metamorphosed and are deeply eroded and faulted. The rocks exposed in the Reting Tsangpo canyon range in age from 400 Ma to 50 Ma. The result of faulting has been to often juxtapose relatively recent rocks with much older rocks. The complex geology is the result of the movement of the Indian continent towards Tibet over the last 200 million years or so. During the period from 125 Ma to 50 Ma the ocean floor between the two continents was pushed under Tibet, melted and injected large volumes of igneous rock into the Tibetan plate and onto Tibet's surface. About 50 million years ago India collided with Tibet, pushing up the Himalayas. Some parts of the ocean floor were pushed up onto the Tibetan Plateau and formed marble or slate. Sea fossils from 400 Ma are found in the river's canyons, and houses are roofed with slate. Large faults developed over the last fifty million years, and these dictate the direction in which the rivers of the region flow. The faults in the rugged terrain typically run in an east‚Äìwest direction. During the ice ages of the last two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the expanded polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the river has cut through the gravel and flows swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the river and blocked it to form rapids.

It is bounded by the Oum Er-Rbia River to its southwest, the oued Cherrate to its northeast, the plain of Tadla to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the northwest. The enclave covers a land area of nearly 14 000 km¬≤. Geographically, the Chaouia can be divided into two sub-regions: low and high. The low Chaouia being the coastal part while the high Chaouia is further inland. Soils vary in fertility: The dark tirs is prized for its high yields and is found among the Mdhakra, Ouled Hriz and Oulad said. There is also the red hamri terra rossa. Throughout Morocco's history, the Chaouia was famous for farming wheat and barley, which were exported in years of abundance from Casablanca, F√©dala or Azemmour. Chaouia sheep was also prized for its wool, which was also exported to Marseille where it was known as wardigha in reference to one of the tribes in the interior.

L√©vy, Pour une histoire linguistique du Maroc, in Peuplement et arabisation au Maghreb occidental: dialectologie et histoire, 1998, pp.11-26 () Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent were settled in the region, mixing with and Arabicizing the local Berbers. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Marinids moved some Zenata Berbers from Eastern Morocco to the Chaouia. In the early 20th century, the Chaouia experienced a strong rebellion.E. Burke, Mouvements sociaux et mouvements de r√©sistance au Maroc: la grande siba de la Chaouia (1903-1907), dans Hesperis Tamuda Rabat, vol.17, 1976, pp.149-163 In 1907, the French entered the region before extending their control over all Morocco.J.

During the French protectorate, the Chaouia was part of the \\"Autonomous subdivision of Casablanca\\". It was then divided into three civilians controls : Chaouia-North (Casablanca) Chaouia-Center (Berrechid) and Chaouia-South (Settat).

Includes photos, drawings, and maps. It is currently used as an apartment building. The structure was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Architecture The original portion of the building, constructed during 1907 and 1908, is six stories tall, buff-colored Roman brick with steel frame, with concrete floors and roof. Fronting on East Carson street, the main commercial road in the South Side Flats, it is 108 ft wide by 116 ft deep, with terra cotta first-story wall cladding and cornice trim work. A three-story-and-mezzanine addition, 36 ft wide by 116 ft deep, was built on the building's east side in 1936. A one-story addition was added to the rear in 1950. The building has been renovated and rehabilitated several times, including 1967-1968 when it was purchased by Goodwill Industries of Pittsburgh for use as its headquarters, store, and workshop, and again in 2012 when it was converted to use as an apartment building. Company store Though Pennsylvania had laws in place to keep industrial firms from owning company stores directly, these laws were easily evaded by having a separate corporation own the store; such was the case with J&L; Steel and the Pittsburgh Mercantile Company. The original officers of the Pittsburgh Mercantile Company were the same as the officers of J&L.; Arguments against the company store system, which had dated back to 1464 in England with what was there called the truck system, included the potential of abuse by paying workers in scrip, which could only be used at company's facilities. Arguments in favor included reducing the problems faced by immigrant workers that were unfamiliar with the language, customs, and problems of acquiring clothing, housing, and food, by setting up company housing and stores with payment in scrip. Pittsburgh Mercantile Company ran a general purpose store at its South Side Flats flagship location, including groceries, dry goods, hardware, and home furnishings. At least seven other locations were established, including Aliquippa and California, Pennsylvania. While hearings, investigations and legislation to end the scrip/company store system continued through the Great Depression and beyond, the scrip system didn't end until 1950. The Pittsburgh Mercantile Company remained profitable for another decade after that.

Lincoln. When the captain of the Setauket Life Saving Station retires, the second in command, Calvin Homer (Warner Baxter), expects to be promoted; but the appointment goes instead to Benoni Bartlett (Wallace Beery), a religious fanatic who has been named a hero as the only survivor of dangerous rescue that claimed the lives of his fellow crewmen at a neighboring station. Bartlett's daughter Norma (Lois Wilson)) convinces Homer to stay in spite of her father's antagonistic ways. Soon a romance springs up between the two of them, even though Myra Fuller (Phyllis Haver) had already finagled a proposal out of Homer. Myra, the village vamp, breaks off her engagement to him. When a storm blows, Bartlett's religious fanaticism proves to be nothing but a cover for his cowardice and he refuses to send his crew out to rescue a vessel in distress. Calvin takes the men out and effects the rescue. Bartlett is discharged, and Calvin is appointed to replace him. Driven insane by his experiences, Bartlett ventures out in a small boat in rough water, and Calvin rescues him. The old man dies from exposure, and Norma, having realized that Calvin was not responsible for her father's disgrace, seeks refuge in his strong arms.

Background  The Sanjak of Klis was established on 12 March 1537, after Ottoman victory in the Siege of Klis. Klis was stronghold of Uskoks and thorn in both Venetian and Ottoman side. It was captured by Ottoman forces commanded by Murat Beg Tardiƒá on behalf of Gazi Husrev-beg who was the sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Bosnia.  Administrative division  The territory of the Sanjak of Klis was composed of the newly captured territories of western Bosnia, Dalmatia (with rivers Cetina, Krka and Zrmanja), Lika and Krbava. The Vilayet Croats was disestablished when it was annexed by the newly established Sanjak of Klis in 1537. The first land survey of the Sanjak of Klis was done in 1540 within the survey of the Sanjak of Bosnia. The defter of 1550 is the oldest preserved defter of the Sanjak of Klis. This early 15th century defters show that the territory of this sanjak was depopulated. The Ottomans populated barren lands with fresh wave of herdsmen. The Sanjak of Klis was part of the Bosnia Eyalet since it was established in 1580, as described by famous Ottoman traveler Evliya √áelebi. Governors Murat-beg Tardiƒá was appointed as the first sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Klis. Tardiƒá remained on that position until 1544 when he was appointed to position of the sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Po≈æega. Malkoƒç-beg died in 1545 as sanjakbey of Klis. Sinan, a son of sultan's wife and sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Klis, died in 1593 in a battle. In 1596 sanjakbey was Mustafa-pasha Pijade-pa≈°iƒá. In period 1609 ‚Äî 1615 sanjakbey was Zulfikar-pasha Atlagiƒá whose successor Piri-pasha killed him in 1616. In 1645 sanjakbey was Miralem who was Albanian. In 1648 sanjakbey was Mehmed Mustajbegoviƒá who lost Klis to Venetians.

The Romani people has a long history, and most likely hails from the Indian subcontinent. Throughout said history, the highly diverse Roma population has faced significant persecution ‚Äì antiziganism ‚Äì in many parts of the world, and continues to do so today. History and status Due to the Romani people's frequent status as outsiders in regards to mainstream society and a constant minority, lacking any form of nation state and in turn facing structural bias and neglect from many national, regional and local governments and authorities, the research done into Romani history and culture has often been either lacking or non- existent. In modern times, even when this issue gradually being resolved in some areas, the field of Romani archaeology remains virtually unexplored. For example, the prominent Hungarian archaeologist Eszter B√°nffy (de), director of the R√∂misch-Germanische Kommission of the German Archaeological Institute, has written that in all of post-Cold War era Eastern Europe, she has not found a single archaeologist of Romani heritage, nor anyone interested in researching let alone excavating possible Romani archaeological sites. While the French sociologist Jean-Pierre Li√©geois (fr), director of the Gypsy Research Centre, has asserted that due to their often highly mobile lifestyle and frequent societal discrimination, the Romani have left behind no such archaeological sites, there have been some limited field surveys and excavations of Romani- related sites. =Scandinavia= Excavated building foundations in Snarsmon, Sweden, 2009. This is especially the case in Sweden and Norway, where the Norwegian and Swedish Travellers arrived in the early 16th century. Two sites in particular have gone through several stages of excavation, with a third excavation project beginning in 2015. One is Snarsmon (also pejoratively called Tattarstaden, roughly the Gypsy Town), a Romani village close to the Norwegian border in Tanum Municipality which was active as a sanctuary from the 1860s until the first years of the 20th century. Surveys began in 2003, with yearly excavations between 2004 and 2007. Done in the style of community archaeology, participants ‚Äì other than professional archaeologists ‚Äì included both local inhabitants of non-Romani origin, as well as members from several Traveller organizations and one Roma cultural association. One result of this project was the establishment in 2012 of the first Swedish museum exhibition about Traveller history, located in the town of Uddevalla, featuring some of the objects found during the excavations. The second Swedish site is Kr√§marstaden (roughly translated, the Huckster Town), likewise a Romani village, located near Finner√∂dja in Lax√• Municipality. The village was established in the first years of the 20th century, and abandoned in the beginning of the 1920s. Core surveys began at the same time as those in Snarsmon, with two phases of archaeological excavation taking place in 2013 and 2014, which much like the previous project involved professional archaeologists and other scientists, local inhabitants, and Swedish Travellers. In August 2015, excavations began at a Romani campsite outside of Stockholm, in Skarpn√§ck. The camp was built in 1959 by the Swedish state as a temporary solution, until apartments could be arranged for the Romani, who had just been given full civic rights (and with that, a right to housing). The camp soon became permanent as the administrative process was dragged out, its inhabitants ‚Äì about thirty people ‚Äì living in tents, caravans and two home- built cottages, exposed to the weather. The two-year project, titled I stadens utkant (In the City's Fringe), is financed partially by the Swedish National Heritage Board, and is a cooperative project between the Swedish History Museum, the cultural association √â Romani Glinda (the Romani Mirror), M√•ngkulturellt Centrum (Multicultural Center) in Botkyrka, and Stiftelsen Kulturmilj√∂v√•rd (the Cultural Environment Management Foundation). It will result in a book and an excavation report, in addition to certain finds forming part of the \\"Sweden's History\\" exhibition at the Swedish History Museum. Several other archaeological sites belonging to the Romani people and the Scandinavian Travellers exist in Sweden as well as Norway, some of which were surveyed and mapped out in the transnational Scandinavian Traveller Map project. One of these, Tattardalen (Gypsy Valley) in Kung√§lv Municipality, is a ruined farmstead dating back to the 1600s, and is therefore the oldest Scandinavian site connected to the Travellers. =Czech Republic= Since 2017 archaeological surveys have taken place at the site of a Roma concentration camp in the Czech Republic. After World War II the site located at Lety u P√≠sku was converted to a pig farm. Recently the farm has been shut down and work is underway to convert the complex into a museum. Archaeological excavations at the site have recovered building materials such as nails and door handles as well as beads and buttons that may have belonged to the prisoners there. Upcoming excavations will seek to locate the camp's burial sites. =Elsewhere= Another example of possibly Romani-related archaeology is a June 2010 excavation of the \\"Caird‚Äôs Cave\\" in Rosemarkie, Scotland, a site possibly inhabited by Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups. In addition to archaeology directly relating to Romani sites, there have also been some research done into the archaeogenetics and \\"linguistic archaeology\\" of the Romani people. An example of this is the discovery of a skeleton in an Anglo- Saxon cemetery under Norwich Castle in Norfolk, which ‚Äì as reported by British Archaeology ‚Äì was genetically identified as a possible Romani man.

These mountains may be reached from Vienna in about an hour and are therefore a popular recreation area for the Viennese.  Accessibility  The Viennese Hausberge - a Hausberg is a local mountain associated with a town or city - may be reached by car on the Southern Autobahn (A2). There are also good public transport links between Vienna and the mountains. For the Raxalpe, the visitor can catch a train on the Southern Railway to Payerbach-Reichenau, then a Retter bus to Hirschwang, Hinterna√üwald or the Preiner Gscheid. For the Schneeberg, Southern Railway trains run to Wr. Neustadt, then the visitor can catch a diesel railcar on the Schneebergbahn to Puchberg and continue on the rack railway up the Hochschneeberg or catch a train to Neunkirchen and the Retter bus to Losenheim. For the Hohe Wand, visitors may also take the train to Wr. Neustadt and continue by bus (operated by Partsch) to Maiersdorf or Stollhof.  Historic development  With the construction of the Semmering Railway this region became popular with day trippers from Vienna. Tourist traffic initially flocked to the Rax and Schneeberg mountains which were easier to get to and were accessible by a cable car and a rack railway. Before mass tourism arrived, many of the visitors were botanists, mineralogists, geographers and agronomists, who took to wandering in the mountains because of their specialism, their reports fascinating citizens of the Biedermeier period, who hitherto had been restricted to day trips in the immediate vicinity of Vienna, to places like the Vienna Woods. The first record of an unofficial climb of the Hohe Wand dates to the year 1862. Alpine clubs were founded and built refuge huts on the high plateau.  Today  The Rax, Schneeberg and Hohe Wand are still the most popular mountains in the Gutenstein Alps and the Rax-Schneeberg Group, and they are very well served, with easy access, good viewing points and numerous waymarked footpaths. By contrast, other mountains such as the D√ºrre Wand or Schneealpe are less often climbed.  Literature  * Karl Flanner: Die Hohe Wand. Menschen - Arbeit - Touristen.

Built in 1902 for a former jeweller to King Edward VII, it remained in private ownership until it was converted into flats and a daycare centre in 1988. It is one of the few large houses and villas to survive in the high-class Withdean area‚Äîmany were demolished in favour of blocks of flats after World War II‚Äîand it has been described as \\"Brighton's finest example of a grand Edwardian house\\". English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Withdean was originally an outlying hamlet in the large Sussex parish of Patcham, adjacent to Preston parish which was itself immediately north of Brighton. The area was merely \\"a scattering of farms\\" until the 19th century, when its position on the main road to London and extensive tree planting carried out from the 1790s made it an attractive place for wealthy people to build large houses and villas. The road was originally a turnpike and had a tollgate at Preston; after it was moved north of Withdean in 1854, people living to the south no longer had to pay tolls to travel into Brighton, further improving the desirability of the largely undeveloped land. Around the same time, the Withdean Strawberry Gardens were developed as an attraction for visitors (especially from Brighton, by now a rapidly growing resort) and residents. They were renamed the Tivoli Gardens in about 1852, and remained a popular attraction throughout the 19th century. By the end of the century, though, they were surrounded by large houses, and in 1888 they were sold off for development. In 1902, the larger part of the Tivoli Gardens site was bought by 55-year-old James John Savage, former jeweller to King Edward VII, who wanted a large house to retire to with his family. He commissioned architects George Burstow & Sons to design a 12-bedroom house \\"with a tower, which would offer panoramic views over the surrounding neighbourhood\\". The building was completed in the same year, and he moved in with his wife, three daughters and a large retinue of servants. He lived there until his death in 1922, and his wife stayed for another 11 years until her death. In 1934 the house was sold at auction to another wealthy local family, the Berrymans, who had lived at a villa called Norbury on the other side of London Road but who had lost much of their land when the road was widened. They paid ¬£4,000 for Tower House. The Auxiliary Territorial Service requisitioned the house during World War II, but it was returned to the Berryman family afterwards and stayed in private ownership until 1988. In that year the house, its grounds and the adjacent Tivoli House (built to the immediate north of Tower House in 1903, and latterly a Brighton Borough Council residential home) were acquired by developers Cussins Green Homes. They demolished Tivoli House and built modern blocks of flats (Robinia Lodge and Tower Gate) and a terrace of houses on the site and in the grounds. Tower House itself was retained, though, and was converted into ten flats and a daycare centre. The exterior was restored at the same time, and Tower House now appears as it would have done when built. Brighton and Hove City Council operate the day centre, which in 2011 was one of four \\"in-house building-based day services for older people\\" in the city. In November 2015, the council stated it was considering closing the day centre and moving the services offered to other locations or outsourcing them to the private sector. Impending cuts to Government grants were identified as the reason. The upper floors of the building now have ten flats. One, the Crow's Nest, covers four storeys including the tower and the space inside its lead- covered cupola. \\"One of Brighton's most unique properties\\", it was put up for sale in 2007. In the same year, another two-bedroom flat in the building was on the market for ¬£349,950. Tower House was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 26 August 1999. This status is awarded to \\"nationally important\\" buildings of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. The house is also within the boundary of the Preston Park Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in Brighton and Hove. Originally designated in 1970 as part of the Preston Village Conservation Area, this was split into a separate area in 1988. The conservation area appraisal states that \\"the most regrettable aspect\\" of the late-20th-century development surrounding Tower House is the creation of a wide access road which breaks the long run of original boundary walls fronting London Road. Architecture Tower House, \\"Brighton's finest example of a grand Edwardian house\\", is an \\"imposing and richly detailed\\" building which‚Äîdespite being set back from the main London Road‚Äîforms a local landmark due to its tall corner tower with a large lead cupola. This has ogee curves and sits on top of an octagonal timber roof lantern. The house is constructed of red brick in the Edwardian/Queen Anne Revival style. It rises to 3‚Äì4 storeys and has a six-window range. The four-storey tower at the south corner is recessed; the main building has a symmetrical fa√ßade composed of two projecting gabled wings with two-storey bay windows and a central recessed three-bay entrance wing. This has a porch in the form of a three-arched arcade, above which projects a wooden balcony. On the roof between the gables is a small dormer window with a curved gable on which is painted the year 1902 and the Savage family's monogram. Further back on the south side is a gabled single-storey conservatory. To the rear are another two gabled wings, the gables tile-hung and with cornices. There is also a wide ironwork veranda. Some original features survive inside, including an arched fireplace, decorative panelling and a Doric-columned arcade, but the central divided staircase and a stained glass ceiling which illuminated the entrance hall were removed during the renovations of 1988. The house \\"contained all the necessary rooms for living in traditional Edwardian style. There were 17 rooms excluding the \\"compact domestic offices\\" for servants, and the grounds covered . The auction particulars of 1934 stated that there were eight \\"principal\\" and four \\"secondary\\" bedrooms, \\"three bathrooms, four reception rooms, spacious hall, billiard room, ... garage, conservatory and outbuildings\\". Unusual features typically seen only in much more modern houses included an underfloor heating system and a combined bath and shower unit.

Sphagnurus paluster, the single species in the genus is pale grey and has a mycenoid stature (i.e. has a conical pileus, a narrow elongated stipe and lacks an annulus or volva). Its basidiospores are nonamyloid and smooth. It lacks cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia. Clamp connections are present.  Etymology  The name Sphagnurus is supposed to be derived from the name of its host Sphagnum and Latin -urus, meaning ‚Äútail\\". The ancient Greek word Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨ however means ‚Äútail\\".Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940).

It ran on Broadway and starred American film actress Esther Dale in the title role. Broadway run Carry Nation premiered in New York on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre on October 29, 1932 and starred Esther Dale, who had been known principally as a singer up to that time. The show was produced by Dale‚Äôs husband, the writer and theater producer Arthur J. Beckhard, and was directed by stage actress Blanche Yurka. The show was playwright McGrath‚Äôs only Broadway play and closed after just 30 performances. Despite its being a flop, the show was notable for having launched the Broadway careers of supporting actress Mildred Natwick and the actors Jimmy Stewart, Myron McCormick and Josh Logan, who had known one another at Princeton University where the three men were members of the University Players theater company. At the time, they were rooming in New York with a fourth University Player alumnus, Henry Fonda. Logan also served as assistant director to Blanche Yurka in the production. The show had originated in summer stock, and some of the young players from the earlier staging were carried over into the New York production in small roles. Esther Dale received glowing reviews from the New York critics for her portrayal of Carry (sic).

Boehm, emigrated from Germany, arriving at Port Adelaide on the Zebra (Captain Hahn) on 2 January 1839, and helped found the town of Hahndorf. He was educated at the local Old Lutheran Church school, then from around 1849 undertook further training with the aim of becoming a teacher; first under Pastor Gothard Daniel Fritzsche (20 July 1797 ‚Äì 2 November 1863) at the Old Evangelical Lutheran Church, L√∂bethal, then at Bethany and at Tanunda under the Rev. Dr. Carl Wilhelm Ludwig Muecke (16 July 1815 ‚Äì 4 January 1898). He began teaching at the Hahndorf Lutheran church school in 1854.Suzanne Edgar, 'Boehm, Traugott Wilhelm (1836‚Äì1917)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1979, accessed online 7 February 2015 In 1857 he opened a private school in his home, criticised by fundamentalist Lutherans for his use of secular textbooks as well as the traditional Bible and catechism. The author of this letter was apparently \\"J. W. Boehm\\", and these initials are seen frequently, but are most likely a misreading of a longhand \\"T.

In 1874 the government grant of ¬£70 per annum came to an end, and in 1877, unable to meet expenses, he sold the school at a loss to the Lutheran Church for ¬£700. Boehm was retained as principal, and in 1879 the school was renamed \\"Hahndorf College\\". though the old name persisted somewhat. After some disputes with the Church, Boehm in 1883 bought back the school, but was forced by insolvency to close it in 1884. In 1886 he sold the building to D. J. Byard, an Oxford-educated Germanophile, who ran it after the same tradition until 1912 when it closed. Boehm moved to Murtoa, Victoria, where he founded a private school in 1887. It too was taken over by the Lutheran Church about 1894 and became Concordia College, which moved to Adelaide in 1904. Boehm, who had remained as music teacher, retired with his daughter to Warracknabeal, where he died in 1917. Family T. W. Boehm married Anna Maria Dolling on 12 August 1858.

History Opened in 1925 as the first theater to be re-established after the destruction of the Astoria fire of 1922, the Liberty Theater was seen as symbolizing the city's rebirth. Its Italian Renaissance architectural and decorative style was unique among Astoria's commercial buildings and stood out from the rest of the post-fire reconstruction. Notably, the auditorium features a set of 12 mural-style oil- on-canvas paintings depicting Venetian canal scenes by local artist Joseph Knowles, extending the Mediterranean atmosphere of the architecture. The building was built for the theater chain of Claude Jensen and John von Herberg, one of over thirty venues they operated throughout the Pacific Northwest, and was designed by the Portland architectural firm of Bennes and Herzog..

It was first described by Charles Horton Peck in 1872. It is commonly called the sphagnum greyling due to it being found in peat bogs and to its cap turning grey as it ages and dries. Description Sphagnurus paluster can be white pruinose when young and does not stain or bruise when crushed. Its flesh is thin, soft, and watery. The cap is in diameter, starting as conical or bell shape when young, expanding flat with a distinct umbo when older. It is smooth, striate, and hygrophanous; usually an olive-brown when moist, drying to a pale grey color. The white to grey gills are adnate or with a slight tooth. Subgills are often present creating a close to subdistant spacing. The stem is long and in diameter, equal and hollow. The coloring is usually lighter than the cap, being grey-brown or grey. The white to cream colored spores are 5.5 to 8.5 ¬µm x 4 to 4.5 ¬µm, elliptical, and smooth. Distribution and habitat Grows in spring to early summer in cool northern climates that support Sphagnum. Found single to gregarious, often growing in bogs or ditches always on Sphagnum. Edibility Unknown. Odor and taste is farinaceous. Parasitism Sphagnurus paluster parasitizes living Sphagnum mosses by forming penetration pegs through hyphae pressure. At the tips of these pegs pectinases are produced to digest the lamella between leaf cells which facilitates entry into both hyaline and chlorophyllous cells. The result is a deterioration of the protoplast and necrosis of the cells.

Although several of the characters are fictional, the bulk of the personages are historical. * The novel Ironfire: An Epic Novel of Love and War (2003) by David W. Ball is the story of kidnapping, slavery and revenge leading up to the siege of Malta. It takes a somewhat less sympathetic view of the Catholic Knights Hospitaller and maintains a more romantic approach. (The British edition is called \\"The Sword and the Scimitar.\\") *Angels in Iron (2004) by Nicholas Prata remains faithful to the historical narrative and tells the story from a distinctly Catholic point of view. * The novel The Religion (2006) by Tim Willocks tells the story of the siege through the eyes of a fictional mercenary called Mattias Tannhauser, who is on Malta fighting (at times) alongside the Knights (referred to primarily as The Religion), while trying to locate the bastard son of a Maltese noblewoman. In this attempt his opponent is a high-ranking member of the Inquisition. The story presents a picture of both sides of the conflict without romanticising or sanitising the content for modern consumption. * It is the main plot of Pirates of Christ (2007), the historical novel by Edward Lamond. *Roger Crowley's Empires of The Sea (2008) has a lengthy section on the siege of Malta. *The novel Blood Rock (2008) by James Jackson tells the story of the siege with a focus on a fictional English mercenary called Christian Hardy. Throughout the siege, Hardy works to discover the identity of the traitor within The Religion who works to ensure a Moslem victory. The traitor works on behalf of the French king, Francis I, who believed that peace with the Ottoman Empire was in the French interest and that the marauding Knights Hospitaller, by annoying the Sultan, threatened the security of France. *In the video game Age of Empires III, released in 2005, the story-based campaign mode has a fictional account of the siege of Malta. *Clash Of Empires: The Great Siege (2011), a novel written by Christopher Hart, under the pen name William Napier, focuses on how the events of 1565 effected Nicholas Ingoldsby, a fictional English character, and the son of one of the Knights of St. John. *Eight-Pointed Cross (2011) by Marthese Fenech remains faithful to historical events and tells the story from the perspectives of a Maltese family and an Ottoman family. The narrative culminates with Dragut's 1551 raid of Gozo. Work on the sequel, which focuses on the Siege of 1565, is currently underway. * The novel The sword and the scimitar (2012), by Simon Scarrow, is set around the Siege of Malta, and recounts events through the eyes of the disgraced veteran Knight Sir Thomas Barrett (a fictional character), who is secretly searching for a hidden scroll that is in the possession of the Knights of St. John, that could threaten the reign of his Queen, Elizabeth I. * The novel The Course of Fortune (J. Boylston, 2015), by Tony Rothman, published in three volumes, recounts the events leading up to the Siege of Malta beginning with the 1551 raid on Gozo, in which the corsair Turgut Reis enslaved the island's entire population. The story is told through the eyes of a young Spanish mercenary and relies heavily on early and original sources.

On August 3, 2018, following the disastrous fires in the region, the municipal council of Marathon passed unanimously a resolution characterising Psinakis \\"undesirable\\", \\"incapable\\" and \\"extremely dangerous even to the physical health of the municipality's citizens\\", and demanding his resignation. Psinakis refused to resign, characterising the action as planned unconstitutional procedure that is not provided for by law and has no legal precedent. According to him it only had purpose of \\"spoofing and anthropophagy\\". Instead of politicking, he urged to manage the consequences of this disaster in a climate of solidarity and joint effort. =Projects and activities= In early 2015, Psinakis was appointed head of international public relations for the Central Union of Municipalities (KEDE). In his association with the appointment, Psinakis has worked to return the Parthenon Marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles, to Greece from the British Museum in London. Psinakis' other activities as mayor include participation in the Hellenic Parliament. In an effort to honor on Greek athletes, celebrities, philanthropists, entertainers, and other notable individuals internationally, Psinakis created the Medal of the Legion of Marathon in 2015. In May of that year, Psinakis presented the first of this award to the President of the Hellenic Republic Prokopis Pavlopoulos. Subsequent recipients of the award have been Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, Hollywood director James Cameron, Jim Gianopulos of 20th Century Fox, actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, and thirty-seven foreign ambassadors from around the world. Recipients of the award are given the title \\"World Ambassador of Marathon\\". Psinakis established the non-profit Marathon Foundation in order to further tourism, sports, and culture in the region as well as promote charitable events for the needy that provide food, water and medical care throughout Greece. In an effort to unite the various regions of Greece containing antiquities as well as historical and cultural landmarks, Psinakis established the Amphictyony of Ancient Greek Cities (Greek: ŒëŒºœÜŒπŒ∫œÑœÖŒøŒΩŒØŒ± ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ Œ†œåŒªŒµœâŒΩ) in March 2016. Headquartered in Marathon, the focus of the association is protection and propagation of Greek cultural heritage and support of cultural interests. Since its inception, numerous municipalities in Greece have become member cities. In an effort to revitalize Marathon, Psinakis has worked with Greek and Chinese investors to create a Riviera-style attraction and international tourist destination. Part of Psinakis' plan for Marathon's future is constructing an entertainment center that includes a casino, marina, hotels, villas, and a golf course. Additional plans by Psinakis for Marathon are for Marathon Lake, a park that would include boating as well as bike jogging trails paths. In cooperation with the Regional Governor of Attica, the culture minister, and the mayor of Lavrio, Psinakis is also working on a scuba diving park that would be centered around the Evian Gulf. Other efforts toward making his city a tourist destination include a trip made by Psinakis to China in May 2016, where he took part in investment negotiations for the construction of a history museum in Marathon.

Origin The sect was formed in the residence of Anna Maria van den Aveelen in S√∂dermalm in Stockholm. She was the widow of the artist Johannes van den Aveelen from the Netherlands. She gathered women to meetings of prayer and bible studies. The bible meetings became popular, and attracted more and more people, among them the radical pietist Sven Ros√©n (Pietist), who formed the bible study group in to a sect. The congregation of the Gr√•koltarna consisted of both sexes, however females had a dominating and leading place. Among the members were members of the noble family Grundelstierna and von Strokirch, the Bryntzenius family as well as among female domestics and wives of soldiers. Ideology Gr√•koltarna believed in the interpretations of dreams and visions, and their message was that the apocalypse was approaching. Because of this, it was essential to prepare oneself for eternity and make amends for one's sins. The members therefore renounced their possessions and practiced a policy of collective ownership of property. They also renounced work, and everything which could distract them from a spiritual life and what they felt that they had been ordered to do by divinity. Many also chose to live in celibacy. They regarded the luxury consumption and wealth, by that growing in Stockholm because of the flourishing merchant business in Sweden during the Age of liberty, as sinful. The sect also attracted positive attention and followers outside of Stockholm. Activity The sect started to attract attention from the Stockholm authorities in 1731. Many members by that time started to practice charitable work among the poor as a way of their spiritual life. As they had renounced all worldly possessions, they had also adopted the most simply dress possible, and was therefore referred to as Gr√•koltarna, \\"The Grey Shirts\\". Many of them had adopted this dress after having sold their old clothes and handed out the money among the poor. Persecution The sect violated the law of Konventikelplakatet, which banned all religious gatherings outside of the church in order to protect the power of the church. In July 1731, the sect was reported to the authorities by the vicar of the Maria congregation in Stockholm. At the following arrest, nine women and a man by the name Lexelius was arrested: the rest had fled to avoid arrest. Anna Maria van den Aveelen denied having participated in a sect and claimed that the gatherings had been common gatherings of prayers by the people and guests of her household, and was left with a fine and lectures in how to avoid breaking the laws of the church, as was Lexelius and his wife. The leading members of the cult were however imprisoned. Among them were Anna Gustafsdotter, Maria Eriksdotter and Elisabet Forsman, who were all placed in L√•ngholmens spinnhus, Stockholm. Anna Gustafsdotter stated that she would never worship the clergy nor submit to anyone except God. They were all imprisoned and sentenced to receive religious instructions. Swedish historian Bengt Sundkler described them as \\"an apocalyptic-kiliastic pietist movement, the so-called Gr√•koltarna [Greyfrocks] in Stockholm of the 1730s\\" who were \\"impoverished, destitute Swedes appearing in penitential grey coats\\". In prison, the women refused to work, attend religious service, convert back to the church or eat. They caused great concern with their statement that God had not given them permission to work. They were imprisoned in cells deprived of light and heating. One of the \\"Sisters\\", Klara Tomasdotter, died during their captivity. Maria Eriksdotter was released in 1736, after having become pregnant with a member of the sect and allowed to marry him, and Forsman returned to her own spouse after this. In 1738, Anna Gustafsdotter, a leading member of the sect, became the last to submit to the church, and was thereby freed.

Habitat and distribution The species is common in the tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is a recent Lessepsian migrant into the eastern Mediterranean Sea, which it reached through the Suez Canal, and it is spreading towards the western Mediterranean. It has been caught off the coasts of Israel, the south of Turkey, in Cyprus, the south coasts of mainland Greece , Crete , and Rhodes. In 2013 it was reported off the waters off Lampedusa Island in the central Mediterranean, and in 2015 off Malta and also in waters near the town of Beƒçiƒái, Montenegro, on the southeastern Adriatic Sea. One specimen was caught in Gruissan (Aude, France) in the summer of 2014..

Description The silver- cheeked toadfish is very similar to the oceanic pufferfish but more elongated and with a symmetrical caudal (tail) fin. Its back is grey or brown with darker spots and it has a white belly. A characteristic silver band runs along the sides of the fish. The silver-cheeked toadfish can measure up to . Feeding The silver-cheeked toadfish preys upon benthic invertebrates. Reproduction Eggs and larvae are found in the pelagic zone. Danger to humans Similar to other puffer fishes, the silver-cheeked toadfish is extremely poisonous if eaten because it contains tetrodotoxin in its ovaries and to a lesser extent its skin, muscles and liver, which protects it from voracious predators. It becomes toxic as it eats bacteria that contain the toxin. This deadly substance causes paralysis of involuntary muscles, which may cause its victims to stop breathing or induce heart failure. Fatal intoxications have been reported in Egypt and Israel.

This symmetry has several equivalent characterizations, which lend to the analysis of such algebras. Many familiar varieties of algebras, such as the variety of groups, consist of congruence- permutable algebras, but some, like the variety of lattices, have members that are not congruence-permutable.

A variety of algebras \\\\mathcal{V} is referred to as congruence- permutable when every algebra in \\\\mathcal{V} is congruence-permutable.  Properties  In 1954 Maltsev gave two other conditions that are equivalent to the one given above defining a congruence-permutable variety of algebras. This initiated the study of congruence-permutable varieties. = Theorem (Maltsev, 1954) = Suppose that \\\\mathcal{V} is a variety of algebras.

Canada: The Death with Dignity Case, British Columbia Civil Liberties Association In a unanimous decision on February 6, 2015, the Court struck down the provision in the Criminal Code, thereby giving Canadian adults who are mentally competent and suffering intolerably and enduringly the right to a doctor's assistance in dying. This ruling overturned the Supreme Court's 1993 ruling in Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG), which had denied a right to assisted suicide. The court suspended its ruling for 12 months, with the decision taking effect in 2016, to give the federal government enough time to amend its laws. In January 2016, the court granted an additional four-month extension to its ruling suspension to allow time for the newly elected federal Liberal government to consult with Canadians on drafting a law to comply with the ruling. As an interim measure, it also ruled that provincial courts can now begin approving applications for euthanasia until the new law passes.  Background  In 1972, the Canadian government repealed the Criminal Code provision prohibiting suicide. However, 241(b) of the Criminal Code provided that everyone who aids or abets a person in committing suicide commits an indictable offence, and section 14 stated that no person may consent to death being inflicted on them. The Supreme Court denied a right to assisted suicide in their 1993 ruling Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG),Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) , [1993] 3 SCR 519. upholding the constitutionality of the prohibitions based upon a thin evidentiary record. In April 2011, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (\\"BCCLA\\") filed a lawsuit challenging both section 14 and section 241(b) of Criminal Code (law that prohibits aiding a person to commit suicide), claiming they violated sections 7 (the right to \\"life, liberty, and security of the person) and 15(1) of the Charter (equality). The case was heard at the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which ruled in favour of the BCCLA in June 2012. The federal government appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which overturned the ruling in a 2‚Äì1 decision in October 2013. The BCCLA then filed a leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Reasons of the Court  The Court framed the issue at bar thus: The Court found that section 241(b) and section 14 of the Criminal Code had a permissible object, identified as \\"not, broadly, to preserve life whatever the circumstances, but more specifically to protect vulnerable persons from being induced to commit suicide at a time of weakness.\\" According to the Court, however, the relevant sections were overbroad in catching cases that fell outside of the object. Thus, the sections unjustifiably infringed section 7 of the Charter; furthermore, this violation was not saved by operation of section 1.Carter v Canada (AG), 2015 SCC 5 = Stare decisis = The Court found that the trial judge was not bound by the Supreme Court's 1993 decision in Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG), instead holding that stare decisis is \\"not a straitjacket that condemns the law to stasis\\".SCC, par. 44 The Court expanded on their discussion of the issue in Canada (AG) v Bedford by ruling trial judges may reconsider the decisions of higher courts if there is a new legal issue at bar, and if circumstances or evidence have \\"fundamentally shift[ed] the parameters of the debate\\". The Court found that the section 7 legal issues raised in the case at bar differed from those in Rodriguez, noting in particular the development of the overbreadth and gross disproportionality principles since 1993. The court also determined that the trial judge was entitled to consider the different \\"matrix of legislative and social facts\\"SCC, par. 47 that had arisen since Rodriguez. = Division of powers = The Court affirmed that section 241(b) of the Criminal Code fell within the federal government's section 91(27) criminal law power. Echoing their decision in Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society,2011 SCC 44 at para 51. the Court dismissed the appellants' argument that section 241(b) lay within the core of the provincial section 92 powers. Interjurisdictional immunity could not prevent the federal government from enacting the legislation, since the proposed core of the provincial health powers was overly vague. The Court reaffirmed that health is an area of concurrent jurisdiction, allowing both the federal and provincial legislatures to legislate in the area.SCC, para 50‚Äì53  Public reaction and planned implementation  The decision was well received by many, but characterized as judicial activism by others. The BCCLA, appellants at the Supreme Court, were \\"overjoyed\\" by the ruling, holding that \\"physician-assisted dying will now be recognized for what it is‚Äîa medical service\\". The day of the decision, Andrew Coyne wrote in his National Post column that the Court was being eerily complacent about ramifications of its decision. He also argued that the decision signaled the death of judicial restraint in Canada. Former politician Stockwell Day was particularly critical of the Court, saying, \\"[I]f you want to write laws, you should run for office.\\" In an op-ed published on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's website, he called for a nationwide debate concerning assisted-suicide legislation. In response to Carter, Conrad Black argued politicians should invoke the notwithstanding clause to send a message to the court that Parliament is supreme. The February 2015 Supreme Court decision in Carter v Canada (AG) limits physician-assisted suicides to \\"a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of life and has a grievous and irremediable medical condition, including an illness, disease or disability, that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition\\". The ruling was suspended for 12 months to allow the Canadian parliament to draft a new, constitutional law to replace the existing one. The Canadian Medical Association (\\"CMA\\") reported that not all doctors were willing to help a patient die. However, the belief in late 2015 was that no physician would be forced to do so but the CMA was offering educational sessions to members as to the process that would be used. Specifically the Supreme Court held that the current legislation was overbroad in that it prohibits \\"physician‚Äëassisted death for a competent adult person who (1) clearly consents to the termination of life and (2) has a grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.\\" The government subsequently requested a six-month extension for implementation; the arguments for this request were scheduled to be heard by the Supreme Court in January 2016. The court decision includes a requirement that there must be stringent limits that are \\"scrupulously monitored.\\" This will require the death certificate to be completed by an independent medical examiner, not the treating physician, to ensure the accuracy of reporting the cause of death. Subsequent legislative history After a lengthy delay, the House of Commons passed a Bill (C-14) in mid-June 2016 that would allow for doctor-assisted suicide in the case of a terminal illness. The bill was then debated in the Senate. Initially, the Senate amended the bill, expanding the right to die. However, when it became apparent that the elected House of Commons would not accept the amendment, a final vote was held on 17 June 2016. At that time, a majority agreed with the restrictive wording provided by the House of Commons indicating that \\"only patients suffering from incurable illness whose natural death is 'reasonably foreseeable' are eligible for a medically assisted death,\\" as summarized by the Toronto Star. Critics of the Bill indicate that the Carter decision was broader, including desperately ill individuals and not only those who are terminally ill or near death. The House of Commons did accept a few Senate amendments, such as requiring that patients be counselled about alternatives, including palliative care and barring beneficiaries from acting in the euthanasia. The bill was given Royal assent the same day. Senators such as Serge Joyal who disagree with the restrictive wording believe that one of the provinces should refer the issue to its Court of Appeal for an opinion; this tactic would help to move the process along and would preclude the need for individuals to proceed with a very expensive appeal process.

Stauffer, assisted by Tsinforn C. Wong, and M. Gardner Tewksbury. The volume was intended as a progress report on the status of Christian churches in China, including social and economic background and local conditions, in preparation for foreign missionaries to turn control over to Chinese Christians, but instead, partly because of the provocative title of the English version, was one of the provocations of anti- Christian movements of the early 1920s. Background Protestant Christian groups from all parts of the world met in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1910 for the World Missionary Conference. Leaders called for greater cooperation among Protestant denominations and soon set up regional Continuation Committees. John R. Mott, the strongest advocate of these developments, visited China in 1913 to organize this work. Regional meetings led to a national conference in Shanghai in March and the formation of the China Continuation Committee. The Committee in turn formed a Special Investigation Committee. Edwin Carlyle Lobenstine of the American Presbyterian Mission and Cheng Jingyi headed the Committee and more than 150 people worked for more than three years to research and prepare the committee's report. The original aim of the Committee had been to promote Christian missionary work, but the committee chose to interpret their goal as to understand China as a society. They included coverage of all administrative zones, cities, demographic statistics, ethnic groups, language and dialects, economic situation, transportation, education, medicine.James Gao, Historical Dictionary of Modern China (1800-1949) (Scarecrow Press, 2007), p. 71-72 The volume is prefaced with \\"Definition Of What Constitutes Adequate Missionary Occupation,\\" by Robert E. Speer, a leading American proponent of Protestant missions. Speer defines \\"adequate missionary occupation\\" as first, \\"establishing within a reasonable time an indigenous Church, which through its life and work will propagate Christianity and leaven the nation or field within whose borders it stands.\\" Speer's second criterion is that, \\"in cooperation with this Church, of presenting Christ to every individual with such clearness and completeness as to place upon him the responsibility of acceptance of or rejection of the Gospel.\\" Lobenstine, as executive secretary of the Continuation Committee, wrote that \\"the coming period is expected to be one of transition, during which the burden of the work and its control will increasingly shift from the foreigner to the Chinese.\\" He pointed out that \\"many of the ablest and most consecrated Chinese Christians\\" have a \\"very intense and rightful desire that Christianity shall be freed from the incubus of being regarded as a 'foreign religion' and ... they regard the predominance of foreign influence in the Church as one of the chief hindrances to a more rapid spread of Christianity in China.\\" Many Chinese were alarmed by the title, however, which contributed to the anti- Christian movements, and the title was widely criticized within the mission community as well. The title in Chinese, writes historian Daniel Bays, was fine ‚Äî Zhonghua gui zhu (China for Christ) ‚Äî but the English title was a \\"public relations disaster.\\" Across China protests broke out, contributing to a strong anti-Christian movement in 1923. The historian Zhang Kaiyuan suggested that from the point of view of a Chinese, the slogan \\"Rooting the Christian Church in China,\\" suggested by Francis C.M. Wei or \\"Christianity Settles Down in China,\\" put forward by Frank Rawlinson, would have suggested a \\"friendly spirit of communication on an equal basis\\" and would have \\"weakened the arrogant colonialist gesture\\" of the past.Zhang Kaiyuan, \\"Chinese Perspective: A Brief Review of the Historical Research on Christianity in China,\\" in Contents The contents include: List of missionary societies, geographical and political divisions of China, language areas, population, communications, non-Christian religious movements, progress (1900-1920), Christian occupation (by Province), unclaimed areas, work with other nationalities, Christian work among special classes [aboriginal tribes, Tai/Dai, Hakka, Muslims, overseas Chinese, government students and Christianity, the blind, post and telegraph workers, rickshaw men, work with boys, YMCA, YWCA, Stewart Evangelistic Fund, work among foreigners].

Long, United States Senate Committee on Finance, advisor to many foreign leaders and CEOs of financial institutions and corporate businesses, and frequent author of articles and papers on global economic, political, and security affairs.  Education  Malmgren initially studied Physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 1953‚Äì54. Offered a full scholarship to Yale University, he transferred to study economics, where he also became Research Assistant to Nobel Laureate Professor Thomas Schelling. In 1956 he was selected as Yale Scholar of the House for his senior year, graduating B.A summa cum laude from Yale University in 1957, and awarded Yale's Howland Fellowship for study and travel abroad. Upon graduation from Yale Malmgren was invited by the Provost of Queen's College to study at the University of Oxford 1957‚Äì58. In autumn of 1958 he moved to Harvard University on invitation from the Dean of Graduate Studies, but returned to Oxford on his appointment as Student of Nuffield College, Oxford University, 1959‚Äì61 and Fellow of the Social Science Research Council, 1959‚Äì61. At Oxford he studied under Professor Sir John Hicks and was ultimately awarded degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford in early 1962.  Scholarly Achievements  During graduate studies at Oxford, Malmgren research was inspired by the historically important debate on markets vs. central planning between Ludwig von Mises and Oskar R. Lange, and by his subsequent personal interaction with Friedrich von Hayek and Oskar Lange. While writing his Doctoral thesis, Malmgren authored several theoretical papers which were published in major peer-reviewed academic journals, including an historically noted academic paper, \\"Information, Expectations, and the Theory of the Firm\\". That paper was republished in several collections of historically significant papers in economic science;3 In this latter 2004 compendium of advances in institutional economics, composed of seven-volumes of historically important essays, the 1961 Malmgren paper is positioned chronologically as one of the first four classical foundation pieces from 1732 to 1961 underlying the emerging scholarly field \\"New Institutional Economics\\" which developed subsequently. This 1961 paper and Doctoral Dissertation were also given central attention in a recent historical analysis of the hundred years‚Äô evolution of Oxford University economics and business studies from Alfred Marshall to the establishment of the Said School of Business at Oxford On the occasion of the retirement of Sir John Hicks from the Drummond Professorship of Economics at Oxford, an essay by Malmgren (\\"Information and Period Analysis in Economic Decisions\\") was included in a 1968 festschrift of papers of world recognized economists, including favorite students of Hicks, published as Value, Capital, and Growth, four years before Sir John Hicks was made Nobel Laureate in 1972. During years of government service and later consultancy roles, Malmgren continued to write numerous peer-reviewed and popular articles in economics, military-security issues, agriculture, tax policy, technological change, geopolitics and other areas of contemporary public controversy.

Career  At the start of his academic career Malmgren was appointed to the Galen Stone Joint Chair in Mathematical Economics in the Department of Engineering and in the College of Arts and Sciences, Cornell University, serving 1961‚Äì62. In the summer of 1962 senior White House and Defense Department officials invited him to join the Administration of President John F. Kennedy. He moved to Washington, D.C., to join the Institute for Defense Analyses (advisers to the Office of the Secretary of Defense), serving as head of the Economics Group and as head of the Economics Group of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG), in the Pentagon. He was known at that time as one of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's \\"Whiz Kids.\\" In late 1964 he was asked by the President's National Security Adviser to join senior staff of the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR), Executive Office of the President.

In early 1972 Malmgren was designated by President Nixon to be the first US official to call for the creation of a Transpacific economic cooperation organization. In 1973 at the behest of President Nixon and French President Pompidou, Malmgren worked directly with French Finance Minister Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing to devise, and subsequently launch the Tokyo Round of world trade negotiations. In 1974 Malmgren personally worked interactively with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Russell Long and Senator Herman Talmadge to draft the historically innovative \\"fast track trade negotiations\\" provision which became embodied in the Trade Act of 1974 ‚Äì the first major revision of US trade law since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. When President Ford took office in 1974 he was also asked to add to his activities the role of special adviser on global economic and security issues to President Ford and to William Seidman, Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs. Following public service, he was appointed as a Fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Smithsonian Institution, 1975‚Äì76, and as an adviser to the Senate Finance Committee, 1976. In 1976‚Äì77 he returned to teaching as Professor of Business and Public Management at George Washington University.

This article on history and contemporary relevance of static vs. fixed defense strategies generated much attention in the US Military and was reprinted in Military Review, the Professional Journal of the U.S. Army,http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p124201coll1/id/645/rec/9 in May 1965. In 1972, in conjunction with The Atlantic Council, Malmgren published International Economic Peacekeeping in Phase II,http://www.worldcat.org/title/international-economic-peacekeeping-in-phase- ii/oclc/610221624?referer=di&ht;=edition which provided an outline of what the next phase of world trade negotiations should encompass, techniques and modalities for conducting such negotiations, and the special challenges for organization of national governments in addressing the international interaction of national laws, policies and regulatory practices. This book was also published in Japanese as The New International Round in 1973. It was utilized by many governments in Europe, Asia, and Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s as a manual for world trade deliberations and negotiations. During the subsequent years of his business and financial consultancies, Malmgren also wrote numerous papers, articles, and chapters for publications of numerous scholars, National Academy of Sciences, The National Academy, The Royal Academy (UK), Royal Academy of Science (Sweden), Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Europa Archiv, and his works have been frequently been translated into Japanese, Chinese, German, Korean, and Spanish. Some of these published articles are currently being assembled and posted on www.academia.edu. He also made numerous presentations to Congressional Committees, Presidential Commissions, and Congressional and parliamentary conferences in Asia and Central Europe. In the world of American jurisprudence Malmgren's exposition of the historic background and Congressional intent of key provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 was cited by the Supreme Court of the United States as explanatory basis of its historically significant trade policy determination in Zenith vs. US Treasury, 1978.Zenith Radio Corporation v. United States, 437 U.S. 443(1978) Malmgren is currently Contributing Editor to The International Economy.http://www.international- economy.com/MastheadTIE.htm  Professional activities  In 1977 he founded the Malmgren Group (international economic consultancy and advisory services on corporate and financial strategies to several CEOs of major US and foreign corporations and banks, and consultancy services to the European Union Commission), and in 1979 also founded the UK company, Malmgren, Golt & Kingston Ltd., 1979 to 1995, consultants to multinational companies, financial institutions, and the Commission of the European Union on European business and regulatory affairs.

He has also been asked to brief many boards of directors. In the mid-1980s former Japanese prime minister Takeo Fukuda asked Malmgren to serve as policy adviser to the Interaction Council, the independent association of former heads of government of all nations.http://www.interactioncouncil.org He continued in this role with Fukuda's successor, Interaction Council Chairman Helmut Schmidt, former Chancellor of Germany. Since the late 1960s Malmgren also acted as an adviser to Several Presidential Commissions, Special Adviser to the OECD Secretary General, the OECD's Wise Men's Group on Global Economic and Financial Reform, the Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and to several Heads of Government and other political leaders in Europe and Asia.

Those two paintings and The Death of Young Bara formed a series devoted to martyrs of the French Revolution. It was removed in 1795 and entrusted to the artist, who still owned it on his death in Brussels. It was then sold by his family to the subject's daughter Louise Suzanne de Mortefontaine. After that sale it disappeared and most probably Louise destroyed it and as many engravings after it as possible in order to erase any trace of her father's part in the Revolution. It is only known through a drawing by Anatole Desvosge and an engraving by Tardieu which partially escaped destruction.

Directed by Barry O'Neil from a script by Lloyd Lonergan, this presumed lost film focuses on a young girl named Grace who becomes attracted to a wealthy man named Jack. Two men, named Turner and Hank plot to rob Jack after he withdraws a large sum of money from a bank, but Grace warns him of a plot to drug him. Jack escapes and marries Grace. The film has no known trade publication reviews, but reviews may exist for this film. Theaters were advertising this film as late as 1913.  Plot  The film is presumed lost, but a surviving synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 11, 1910. It states: \\"Turner, a man of bad character, conducts an inn in the country. His stepdaughter Grace is his trudge. When on an errand to the village she meets Jack, wealthy young man. He is much attracted by her. Jack goes to the bank and draws a large sum of money. Hank, a pal of Turner, sees him and tries to ambush him on the road, but fails. Then he goes ahead to tell Turner. Jack, on his trip, meets Grace. Nearly exhausted, he takes her home, and thus seems to play directly into the hands of the villains. They steal his revolver, and would drug him, were it not for the fact that Grace writes a warning on the wall with wine. Jack, aided by Grace, escapes but the girl is wounded. Jack marries Grace.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film director was Barry O'Neil, the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy. O'Neil would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast for the production is also unknown, but the cast may have included the leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. An article in The Moving Picture World over a botched scene identifies Barry O'Neil as the director who stunned the studio workers. In a critical scene in the film, the two villains bungled the attempt to drug the hero and wound up drinking the drugged drink. O'Neil reportedly called out, \\"Stop! You've drank the poison!\\" The article was published on May 14, 1910, and gives a loose timetable for when the film was being produced.  Release  The single reel drama, approximately 1000 feet in length, was released on June 10, 1910. The film was advertised in the June 11, 1910 edition of Billboard magazine. The film was advertised as late as 1911 in one Indiana theater and as far late as 1913 in a Texas theater. It is unknown if published reviews for this work exist, but there is an absence of a citation Bowers or the American Film Institute catalogs. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications.

The History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory, vol. I (1905). p. 10; 28. Lineage This illustrious lineage produced Osraige's native kings and lords- all claimed to be commonly descended on the paternal line from the second-century king Loegaire Birn Buadach (Loegaire Birn \\"the Victorious\\"), son of √ìengus Osrithe and gave rise to a number of related individuals and later, clans which remained intact and identifiable into the modern era. The term D√°l Birn was in use long before the advent of surnames in Ireland, yet because of long- standing oral and written traditions in Ireland, it continued to be used as a mark of hereditary distinction in sources composed through the twelfth century after the common advent of surnames. For a two-hundred year period beginning the late fifth century, the native D√°l Birn kings were temporarily displaced by an allied Corcu Lo√≠gde dynasty which ruled Osraige until finally being overthrown. A number of the Corcu Lo√≠gde kings are recorded as being periodically slain by the native inhabitants of Osraige until the re- establishment of the D√°l Birn. D√°l Birn descendants remained in control of parts of Osraige, even after the Norman Invasion of Ireland, with the continuation of the Mac Giolla Ph√°draig lordship in Upper Ossory. Sources The term or its equivalent is found in a number of early and high medieval Irish sources, including Codex Salmanticensis and Codex Kilkenniensis in the vitae of St. Ciar√°n of Saighir;Plummer's English translation from Bethada N√°em n√ârenn, available on CELT: http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201000F/text005.html the F√©lire √ìengusso,The Martyrology of Oengus refers to St. Nem of Aran as \\"Nem maccu Birn\\"; which is equivalently rendered as \\"Nem mac Ua Birn\\" or \\"Nem D√°l Birn\\", and elsewhere confirms this with stating Nem's relation to St. Ciar√°n of Saighir. See: http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G200001/index.html and in Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson B 502. D√°l Birn descendants =Lineages= In addition to all the native Ossorian kings (not counting the Corcu Lo√≠gde), a number of other notable family names descend from D√°l Birn: * Mac Giolla Ph√°draig of Osraige, which in the mid-sixteenth century Normanized their surname to Fitzpatrick. From these spring the Barons and Earls of Upper Ossory, Gowran, and Castletown. * Ua Braon√°in (or √ì Braon√°in) of Idough, descended from Braon√°in, a younger son of Cerball mac D√∫nlainge, Anglicized to O'Brennan. =Individuals= * St. Ciar√°n of Saigir * St. Nem of Aran References External links * HD image of MS Rawlinson B502, fol. 70 v. containing an Ossorian genealogy *Fitzpatrick - Mac Giolla Ph√°draig Clan Society Category:Ancient Irish dynasties Category:FitzPatrick dynasty Category:Kings of Osraige Category:Irish royal families Category:Gaelic-Irish nations and dynasties ","title":"D√°l Birn"},{"id":"45325515","text":"thumb Ivel Springs is a 15.4 hectare Local Nature Reserve in Baldock in Hertfordshire.

He went there in 1868, where he obtained a position in the workshop of Eduardo Rosales. While there, he sent his works to the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, winning several awards for his Baroque-style paintings. Suffering from the effects of malarial fever, he returned to Spain and taught at the Academia de San Carlos for a year. His portrait of Santa Clara praying won First Prize at the Exhibition of 1871. That same year, his pension was cancelled, as he showed no inclination to return to Rome. As a result, he moved to Madrid, where he found work decorating various buildings, including the palace of Eduardo, Duque de Bail√©n. He married in 1874 and, the following year, moved to Paris, where his works consisted largely of detailed historical genre scenes and portraits for high society patrons, many of whom were former clients of Mari√† Fortuny. During this time, he absorbed some elements from the style of Meissonier as well as brightening his palette under the influence of the Impressionists. He also made contacts with art dealers in the United States. William Henry Vanderbilt and Augustin Daly were among those who bought his paintings. In 1914, at the start of World War I, he returned to Madrid, moving in with his son Roberto (1883-1956), who was also an artist; widely known for his paintings of bullfights.Roberto Domingo website.

Although primarily a sports video game, Horse Racing received Mattel's \\"Gaming Network\\" branding, due to its pari-mutuel betting on horses during the game. The game houses 8 virtual Thoroughbred race horses residing in the fictional Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables at a fictional western Kentucky race track called Plympton Downs (based loosely on long-time sportscaster/Intellivision sales personality George Plimpton). Each of the horses have differing racing abilities (front runner, pace keeper, come from behind, ...), and do vary from game time to game time (a horse with come from behind traits during one match may have front runner abilities during the next match). These horses are known by their colors (instead of their post position numbers‚Äîunlike in regular horse racing). Horse Racing was also released by Sears for their Intellivision private-label clone, the Super Video Arcade. Gameplay In Intellivision's original Horse Racing game, 6 players (bettors) begin each of the 10 races on the simulated match program by checking out the race program screen; 4 horses are entered for each race, with bettors starting out with a $750 simulated bankroll. For each of the 4 horses entered into a race, the odds‚Äîalong with past performances‚Äîare listed (accessed by a side action button during placing bets). Each bettor then keys in his/her player number (from 1 to 6 on the keypad), enters a bet pay amount against his/her bankroll, then‚Äîplaces the bet (of a win or exacta only‚Äîby pressing [9] on the keypad) on his/her selection of horse(s). After all bets are made, a keypad press of [0] then [ENTER] starts the race. The call to the post then plays. After a brief silence, the starting gate opens up, and 4 Thoroughbred horses run away from the gate. During the actual race, the disk/joystick is used to move a horse along, while the side action buttons perform either of 2 functions (top to coax a horse along, bottom to whip it). Each race takes place on any of 3 different types of track: dry, turf (grass), or muddy; additionally, the races run in length from 3 to 10 furlongs. After the horses cross the finish line, the results are shown on the tote board as colorful horse heads (reading from right to left in finishing order), along with the elapsed time of the race. The play screen then switches to the bet placing screen for the next race; after the full 10-race match program has run, a final GAME OVER screen shows up, with the bettors' final bankroll amounts. The track is horizontally scrolling, with its color changing according to the racing surface (khaki for dry, pine green for turf, and brown for muddy). A 4-stall starting gate with the horses loaded therein is shown at the start of each race. The cheering crowd fanfare sound is played as the horses cross the finish line. The Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables The RTS is a fictional stable in where the race horses featured in the game are housed. Each horse has differing abilities and personalities. These are referred to by their colors (unlike in actual horse races where they would get entrant post position numbers in relation to the inner rail). These are assigned a button on the keypad as follows: * [1] PINK ‚Äî Pink Lady * [2] RED ‚Äî Red Devil * [3] ORANGE ‚Äî Sun Shine Shake * [4] YELLOW ‚Äî Gold Torts * [5] GREEN ‚Äî Green Goblin * [6] BLUE ‚Äî Blue Boy * [7] VIOLET (PURPLE) ‚Äî Grape Ghost * [8] WHITE ‚Äî Snowy Guy On the original prototype ROM, there was a BLACK horse called Black Maurauder; however, he got dropped from the original release of the game, and got replaced by Snowy Guy.

The work was first published in the United Kingdom on October 6, 2014 and concerns an English pastor who is sent to the planet of Oasis to teach its reclusive native inhabitants about Christianity. Michel Faber has stated that The Book of Strange New Things may be his last written work. Amazon Studios released a pilot episode of a television adaptation, Oasis, in March 2017.  Plot  Peter Leigh, an English pastor, decides to leave his wife Beatrice in order to be a missionary. It is gradually revealed that rather than being a missionary in a different country he has been hired by a private American corporation called USIC to preach to the native population of a distant planet called Oasis. Peter expects to find hostility when meeting the native population but finds instead that they are extremely welcoming, already speak English very well and are passionate devotees of the Christian faith, referring to themselves as Jesus Lover One, Two, etc. Peter sets to work trying to build a church for the Jesus Lovers and trying to live amongst them. On his brief trips back to the base camp where the engineers and scientist who run USIC on Oasis live, he tries to contact Bea using a Shoot, a message system which allows him to communicate back on Earth. Though Bea's initial messages are full of love they also include information on severe natural disasters caused by climate change including flooding and famine that have happened since Peter left. After a few months she also informs Peter that she is pregnant with his child, conceived on the last night he was with her. Peter, whose life is full with his missionary work, feels distant from Bea and begins to find it difficult to recall her face and their life together, instead focusing on integrating himself into the Oasan community. While helping them with a harvest, which they trade with the USIC population for medicine, Peter receives a terrible bite from a pest native to Oasis. The community is horrified and treat him as though he is dying. Peter believes he has been poisoned, but nevertheless goes back to USIC, where he is treated for his wounds and receives a message from Bea telling him that there is no God. In distress Peter decides to go back to the Oasan village in order to die, but accidentally finds the village they abandoned before he arrived, where he meets the linguist that was his predecessor, who warns him that the USIC workers are not as harmonious as they appear and that Earth is dying. The following day he is retrieved by Grainger, the USIC pharmacist with whom he is closest, who implies he may have been hallucinating as he was severely dehydrated. Back on the USIC base camp he learns that his favorite Oasan, Jesus Lover Five, has come to the USIC camp seeking treatment, as a fallen painting which bruised her hand has led to her dying. Peter realizes with horror that the reason Oasans have embraced Jesus so much is because they are terribly vulnerable to injury and death and take the tales of healing miracles, Heaven and Jesus rising from the grave literally. Based on Bea's attitude and the fact that he has unintentionally deceived the Oasans, Peter decides to return to Earth. He goes back to the Oasan town once more where his congregation, who last saw him receiving severe injuries, treat his return as a miracle. As a parting gift to them, he tries to explain that humans are capable of recovering from injuries in a way the Oasans are not, but they remain faithful Christians nevertheless. Before he leaves for Earth Peter receives a last message from Bea telling him to stay where he is as she has to move houses and the Earth is unsafe. However, Peter is resolved to return to her and their unborn child and remain with them even until the end of the world. Reception Critical reception for The Book of Strange New Things has been mostly positive and the work has received praise from io9, the New York Times, and The Independent. The Guardian praised the work for being \\"astonishing and deeply affecting\\" and wrote \\"This is a big novel ‚Äì partly because it has to construct and explain its unhomely setting, partly because it has such a lot of religious, linguistic, philosophical and political freight to deliver ‚Äì but the reader is pulled through it at some pace by the gothic sense of anxiety that pervades and taints every element.\\" NPR was more mixed in their review, commenting that as a work of science fiction the book was overly familiar and compared it unfavorably to A Canticle for Leibowitz while also stating that Faber \\"tells a beautifully human story of love, loss, faith and the sometimes uncrossable distances between people. It feels, more than anything, like an achingly gentle 500-page first chapter to an apocalypse novel yet to come.\\" The Portsmouth Review calls it \\"a brilliant look at how distance can change what we see and where we place our loyalty.\\" References Category:2014 American novels Category:2014 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:American post- apocalyptic novels Category:Hogarth Press books ","title":"The Book of Strange New Things"},{"id":"45325660","text":"Microglossum is a genus of fungi in the family Geoglossaceae.

When that failed, she returned briefly to Hollywood to make several B films, before retiring in 1937. Early life Francis was born on August 31, 1906, in Temple, Texas, and grew up in Dallas. After high school, Francis attended Southern Methodist University and moved to New York City, where she attended Columbia University. Career Her break came when she was 19 years old, when she was cast as a Ziegfeld girl in the Broadway production, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925. For the remainder of the decade she worked constantly for Florenz Ziegfeld, appearing in three more of his productions in featured roles, including a major role in the musical comedy, Rio Rita, which starred the comedy duo of Wheeler and Woolsey. Curiously, when Wheeler and Woolsey reprised their stage roles in a very successful 1929 film of the same name, Francis was not cast in the film, most likely because she was one of the stars in the Broadway production of Show Girl, which also starred Jimmy Durante, Eddie Foy, Jr., and Ruby Keeler. While appearing in Show Girl, talent scouts from Fox Film saw her song and dance ability and signed her to a contract, intending for her to appear in musicals. Her debut film was in a featured role in the Fox's big budget musical of the year, New Movietone Follies of 1930. Her performance garnered good reviews by the New York Times, even though the film did not due well at the box office, due to flagging audience interest in these type of musical reviews. She had featured roles in two more films that year, including the John Ford comedy Up the River. Due to the lack of success of Fox Movietone Follies of 1930, Fox dropped Francis' contract, but she quickly switched studios to Warner Bros., where she had her biggest film successes playing tough no-nonsense women. During this period in the early 1930s she had significant roles in several notable films. She had featured roles in two films with James Cagney in 1931, Smart Money and Blonde Crazy. In 1932, she had supporting and featured roles in numerous films, including what some said was her best role, as Linda in I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, which starred Paul Muni. Both the film and Muni were nominated for an Academy Award. However, after Fugitive, the roles offered to Francis began to be smaller, and in smaller films, although she continued to be quite active through the mid 1930s. In early 1935, she had one of her few starring roles, in Stone of Silver Creek, which also starred Buck Jones, with whom she developed a friendship. Not satisfied with the caliber of work she was getting, Francis attempted to resurrect her Broadway career, returning to New York, where she starred in Satellite, which lasted a single performance in November 1935. After her failure to re-launch her stage career, she returned to Hollywood, where she starred in two more westerns with Jones in 1937, before retiring. Death Francis died in Los Angeles on October 30, 1959, at age 53.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to strike back against Hydra after an apparent defeat to the latter, while several characters discover they have gained new abilities following the end of the previous episode. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon, and directed by Billy Gierhart. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki. Palicki was promoted to series regular with this episode, after having a recurring guest role in the first half of the season. The episode also saw the return of Marvel's \\"The Art of...\\" marketing initiative. \\"Aftershocks\\" originally aired on ABC on March 3, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 4.48 million viewers. Plot In 1983, a young man named Gordon goes through a transformation, losing his eyes and gaining the ability to teleport. He is scared of what has happened to him, but is comforted by Jiaying, a young-appearing woman who herself is special, having not aged in decades. Jiaying has guided many young people through their own transformations, knowing that without guidance, they would be lost. This is a situation that her daughter, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Skye, is now unknowingly in, having gained earthquake abilities in an alien city while her friend, Agent Triplett, died. In quarantine due to the potential effects of the city on her, Skye feels responsible for everything bad that has happened. Director Phil Coulson, however, blames Hydra for their misfortune, and devises a plan to get revenge against the rival organization. Hydra themselves feel like they have been heavily defeated since Coulson killed their North American commander, Daniel Whitehall. In a meeting with several high level Hydra operatives, Dr. List, a representative of Hydra's leader Baron von Strucker, explains that whoever can take out S.H.I.E.L.D. for good will get Whitehall's position, setting up a power struggle between the other members. In the alien city, Agent Jemma Simmons is preparing to flood it to prevent anyone else entering it, but not before Raina, who was changed in the temple like Skye, crawls out of the rubble left by an earthquake and kills several agents. Raina's appearance is now monstrous ‚Äì she is covered in thorns and spikes. Escaping the tunnels, Raina tracks down Skye's father, Cal, and demands he fix her. He reminds her that she got what she wanted, and tells her that if she can not live with who she has become, then she should not. Coulson makes a deal with Brigadier General Glenn Talbot to give him Whitehall's former second-in-command, Sunil Bakshi, in exchange for assistance with taking down Hydra's forces. En route to the hand over, Coulson and Agent Melinda May are attacked by Hydra forces. After a fire fight, Coulson, May, and all but one Hydra operative are dead. Bakshi escapes with the operative, who is actually S.H.I.E.L.D. ally Lance Hunter: The attack was a ruse. Bakshi leads Hunter to the house of one of the top Hydra members, Octavian Bloom. Bloom and Bakshi believe that the other top members are targeting them, and send out an order to have them killed, along with Hunter. Hunter, with the help of Agent Bobbi Morse, fights his way into the house, kills Bloom, and takes Bakshi back into custody, to finally be delivered to Talbot. Now, all of Hydra's top level operatives in North America are dead. Simmons feels that Raina may be the first victim of an epidemic, and should be put down. Agent Leo Fitz deduces that Skye caused the earthquake in the alien city, and so herself has been altered just like Raina. Hearing what Simmons wants to do to Raina, Fitz decides to hide the truth from the rest of the team. Skye believes that there is something wrong with her, but Fitz tells her that she is just different now, and there is nothing wrong with that, and she is released from quarantine. Raina, unable to come to terms with who she is, takes Cal's advice and attempts suicide. She is prevented by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who try to take her in, but before anything happens, a much older Gordon appears, and teleports away with her. In an end tag, a model car that Agent Mack built for Coulson scans the latter's office, discovering the \\"toolbox\\" that former S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury gave to Coulson. Mack secretly reports this discovery to Morse while making food, then they join in with the rest of the team having drinks and sharing memories of Triplett. Production =Development= In February 2015, Marvel announced that the eleventh episode of the season would be titled \\"Aftershocks\\", to be written by executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon, with Billy Gierhart directing.

The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. The poster for \\"Aftershocks\\" was created by Gabriele Dell'Otto, the co-creator of Daisy Johnson, and depicts Skye twice, as she is transforming from the Terrigen Mist and as the person dealing with her powers, as well as a transformed Raina, Coulson and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background. Dell'Otto was chosen specifically because of his relationship to the character. =Home media= The episode began streaming on Netflix on June 11, 2015, and was released along with the rest of the second season on September 18, 2015, on Blu-ray and DVD. Reception =Ratings= In the United States the episode received a 1.6/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.6 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast.

She was educated in London and travelled widely. As a highly respected third generation British settler, Fairbridge was a pillar of the colonial establishment. She met with British women from the upper social classes who traveled to South Africa from Britain before and during the Second Boer War. Fairbridge was a founding member of the Guild of Loyal Women, a charitable organisation that encouraged women in South Africa and supported the British Empire and its British Empire forces engaged in conflict. The guild ensured that the relatives of dead soldiers were contacted, and that the graves were properly marked and recorded. When the guild sent members to Britain to explain what they were doing to raise money, women who had the ear of the male British establishment formed the Victoria League to promote links between organisations within the British Empire. These women induced Violet Markham, Edith Lyttelton, Violet Cecil and Margaret, Countess of Jersey all of whom had met Dorothea Fairbridge socially. After the Boer war, Fairbridge continued to support South Africa's integration into the British Empire. She sought to establish the Union of South Africa with a reconciled population and a shared sense of South African history. The Union of South Africa was established within a constitutional arrangement that encouraged close ties with the rest of the British Empire. =Works= Her works include: *That Which Hath Been (1910) ‚Äî a novel set in the early in the Cape's history. *Piet of Italy (1913) *The Torch Bearer (1915) *History of South Africa (1917) ‚Äî a school history *Historic Houses of South Africa (1922) ‚Äî a study of old Cape Dutch farmsteads *The Uninvited (1926) *Along Cape Roads (1928) ‚Äî A travel guide *The Pilgrim's Way in South Africa (1928) ‚Äî a travel guide *Historic Farms of South Africa (1932) ‚Äî a study of old Cape Dutch farmsteads *Gardens of South Africa (1934) ‚Äî With some Chapters on Practical Gardening under South African Conditions and some Notes on the Cultivation of South African Wild Flowers Fairbridge edited: *Lady Anne Barnard's Cape diaries (1924) Notes References * * Category:1862 births Category:1931 deaths Category:South African women novelists Category:South African non-fiction writers Category:South African conservationists Category:South African environmentalists Category:South African women environmentalists Category:South African people of British descent Category:Women conservationists Category:South African editors Category:South African women editors Category:People from Cape Town Category:19th-century South African novelists Category:20th-century South African novelists Category:White South African people Category:19th-century South African women writers Category:20th-century South African women writers ","title":"Dorothea Fairbridge"},{"id":"45325716","text":"The Mad Locomotive is a 1922 short animated film and part of a series of films based on the comic strip Jerry on the Job by Walter Hoban.

He was one of the military field commanders who led the group's seizure of the Yemeni capital Sana‚Äôa in September 2014, and eventually became the de facto leader of Yemen after the Houthi takeover of the Yemeni government in 2015. He is a cousin of Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi, the group's leader. According to the 6 February 2015 statement by a Houthi representative, the Revolutionary Committee is in charge of governing Yemen and forming a new parliament, which will then appoint a five-member presidential council. However, other reports indicated the committee itself would serve as the presidential council. Al- Houthi has been described as a \\"former political prisoner\\". Presidency Mahmoud Al-Junaid was named as director of the presidential office on 9 February 2015, although he declined to confirm to the Yemen Times whether he was working for them. The newspaper Asharq al-Awsat reported on 19 February that al-Houthi had been sacked over the lack of an agreement among Yemen's political factions to support the Houthis' transitional authority, but a senior Houthi leader denied that he had been dismissed. The next day, Reuters and other news outlets reported that UN-led negotiations had produced a tentative agreement regarding the Yemeni parliament, but it did not address the political dispute over the presidency. On 21 March 2015, al-Houthi spoke at a meeting of the Revolutionary Committee, giving an address in which he said Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi's term of office legally ended on 21 February 2015 and his legitimacy had expired. He criticised foreign governments for continuing to back Hadi, accusing them of \\"blatant interference\\" in Yemeni affairs. Al-Houthi was injured by a Royal Saudi Air Force strike in Sana'a during the first night of a military intervention in Yemen led by Saudi Arabia on 25 March 2015, according to Al Jazeera. Houthi-controlled state media reported in November 2015 that al-Houthi sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calling on the UN to restrain the Saudi-led coalition and accusing the coalition of \\"war crimes\\" and \\"genocides\\" against Yemen. On 15 August 2016, the Supreme Revolutionary Committee handed power to the Supreme Political Council. =International reactions= The United Nations, the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council refused to recognise the legitimacy of the Houthi declaration placing al-Houthi and the Revolutionary Committee in charge of Yemen's government. The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on 15 February 2015 calling on the Houthis to relinquish control of state institutions, with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warning that Yemen teetered on the verge of state failure. On 9 November 2018, an opinion article by al-Houthi calling for peace in Yemen was published in The Washington Post.

The film focuses on Tom Taylor, a woman-hater, who sells his property to a financier at a play. In order to finalize the transaction, Taylor must go to the financier's hotel and becomes the subject of a bet by Lou Bennett that she can win his affections. Lou succeeds in the bet, but Taylor finds out and is preparing to leave forever when Lou speaks to him. Little is known about the production or the cast other than a single credit of Violet Heming as Lou Bennett. The film was released on June 14, 1910, but is not known to have been reviewed by any trade publications. The film is presumed lost, but another production of the same name released the same year was rediscovered in New Zealand in 2010.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: \\"Tom Taylor, the owner of a pretty rustic cottage, where he lives all alone, believes himself to be a woman hater, and reproaches his friend John Sparks, when the latter tries to ornament the cottage with posters of women. Taylor's property is valuable, and at the opening of the play a financier purchases it at a satisfactory figure. To close the deal, Taylor is obliged to go to the financier's hotel, and there he attracts the attention of four pretty young girl guests. One of them, Lou Bennett (played by Violet Heming), asks John to introduce Tom. This John declines to do on the grounds that Tom is a woman hater. Lou bets the other girls that she can make Tom fall in love with her and propose to her within a week. They take the bet, not knowing Tom's name or where he lives. They follow his horse, borrowing a buggy built for two, that is waiting outside the hotel. Lou meets Tom, and wins her bet - he falls in love with her. But, incidentally, the girl loses her own heart. Tom finds that he has been tricked, and is preparing to go away forever, when Lou arrives, speaks with him, and all ends nicely.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Only one credit for the film is known: Violet Heming as Lou Bennett. The other members cast in the production are unknown, but the cast may have included the leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.  Release  The single reel drama, approximately 1000 feet in length, was released on June 14, 1910. Theater advertisements for the film were found in newspapers in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. The film was alternatively known and advertised as Taming a Woman Hater. One theater in Pennsylvania would advertise Thanhouser's Jane Eyre as a magnificent and costly production and follow it up with The Woman Hater with the generic advertisement promotion that it was a great film. It is unknown if published trade reviews for this work exist, but there is an absence of a citation Bowers. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications. The film was labeled a comedy in an advertisement, using the name Taming a Woman Hater in The New York Dramatic Mirror on June 18, 1910. Identification of the film in showings and reviews is complicated by the existence of Pat Power's The Woman Hater. Though it bears the same name, the film was released on November 26, 1910. It was the Powers film that was rediscovered in New Zealand in 2010.

Bills is a game designer who has worked primarily on role-playing games. Career Randall N. Bills had been a fan of Battletech back in the early 1990s when he met then-line-developer Bryan Nystul at Gen Con 27 over an all-night game of The Succession Wars (1987). During the next year and a half, Bills had gotten to know some of the FASA staff better, even touring their Chicago headquarters, while simultaneously writing for the fan club's Mechwarrior Quarterly. When FASA had an assistant developer job open up in late 1995, they had made sure Bills got the invitation and eventually hired him. By 2000, Bills had become the Battletech Line Developer. In the meantime Bills had also begun writing Battletech fiction, and produced two novels for the original era of the game: Path of Glory (2000) and Imminent Crisis (2002). After FASA, Bills went to work for WizKids. When WizKids acquired the rights to the future of the BattleTech Franchise (re-christened as MechWarrior), they approached several of the established BattleTech authors including Bills and Michael A. Stackpole to resurrect the novel franchise. In 2001, FanPro LLC hired Bills to continue with his job as Battletech Line Editor; that made Bills FanPro LLC's second and only other employee. FanPro continued on with the Battletech line for the next few years, all under Bills' guidance. Bills heard about Loren L. Coleman's idea for a new business, and in 2003 Coleman created the company InMediaRes Productions to hold his vision, which he founded with Heather Coleman, Randall Bills, Tara Bills, and Philip DeLuca. InMediaRes kicked things off with the fiction of founders Bills and Coleman. Bills continued working at WizKids through 2004. In 2007, Rob Boyle and Bills tried to buy FanPro LLC from Fantasy Productions and when that did not work out they threatened to leave and implied that they would be bidding for the WizKids licenses, which were just coming up for renewal. WizKids stepped in to mediate; although they were not willing to let Boyle and Bills create a new company, they were willing to give the licenses to InMediaRes. After acquiring the rights to Shadowrun and Battletech, InMediaRes took on Boyle and Bills as regular staff ‚Äì which had been part of the agreement with WizKids; Boyle remained as the Shadowrun Line Editor for the next few years, while Bills became a Managing Director of InMediaRes (with Herb Beas taking over as Battletech Line Director). InMediaRes created the subsidiary Catalyst Game Labs to hold their new gaming rights. At the end of 2009, Catalyst did a financial audit and discovered that a substantial amount of money had gone missing; Bills would later explain the losses by saying that the audit had discovered that a \\"co-mingling of funds between the personal and business had occurred involving the company's primary shareholders\\".

Boyle considered making a bid to license Shadowrun, but before he could, Fantasy Productions expressed interest in Shadowrun themselves. Fantasy Productions founder Werner Fuchs invited Boyle to visit him in Germany, and Boyle was soon setting up and running FanPro LLC, a new corporation created by two of the principals of the Fantasy Productions and Boyle himself. They created the new USA subsidiary FanPro LLC to hold the rights to FASA's game lines. FanPro licensed Shadowrun in early 2001, and Boyle took over as Line Editor. FanPro got Shadowrun going again almost immediately, and Boyle's biggest concern was continuing the metaplot. Boyle also tried out something new: the downloadable \\"Shadowrun Missions\\", which were overseen by Rich Osterhout in their first season. Boyle started working on a few edition of Shadowrun around 2003, having decided that the game needed simplification, which was published as Shadowrun, Fourth Edition (2005).

After Saleh left office in early 2012 as part of a mediated agreement between the Yemeni government and opposition groups, the government led by Saleh's former vice president, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, struggled to unite the fractious political landscape of the country and fend off threats both from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Houthi militants that had been waging a protracted insurgency in the north for years. In September 2014, the Houthi insurgency transformed into a full-blown civil war as Houthi fighters swept into the capital of Sana'a and forced Hadi to negotiate a \\"unity government\\" with other political factions. The rebels continued to apply pressure on the weakened government until, after his presidential palace and private residence came under attack from the militant group, Hadi resigned along with his ministers in January 2015. The following month, the Houthis declared themselves in control of the government, dissolving Parliament and installing an interim Revolutionary Committee led by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a cousin of Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. However, Hadi escaped to Aden, where he declared that he remains Yemen's legitimate president, proclaimed the country's temporary capital, and called on loyal government officials and members of the military to rally to him. On 27 March 2015, the BBC reported that Hadi had \\"fled rebel forces in the city of Aden\\" and subsequently \\"arrived in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh\\" as \\"Saudi authorities began air strikes in Yemen\\". Since 2017 the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) has also fought against the government. Background The wave of protests known as the Arab Spring did not take long to arrive in Yemen after the Tunisian Revolution. Yemen was a poor country with a government widely acknowledged to be corrupt, with a large amount of weapons in private hands. By 2011, the country was already facing challenges from al Qaeda-linked militants and separatists in the south and Zaydi Shia rebels in the north. Yemen had only been unified since 1990, and deep divisions persisted between the north and south. =Ecological crisis= Yemen's political instability has been compounded and partly caused by the severe ecological crisis in the country. The average Yemeni has access to only 140 cubic meters of water per year for all uses, (101 gallons per day) while the Middle Eastern average is 1000 m3/yr, and the internationally defined threshold for water stress is 1700 cubic meters per year. Yemen's groundwater is the main source of water in the country but the water tables have dropped severely leaving the country without a viable source of water. For example, in Sana'a, the water table was 30 meters below surface in the 1970s but had dropped to 1200 meters below surface by 2012. The groundwater has not been regulated by Yemen's governments. Even before the revolution, Yemen's water situation had been described as increasingly dire by experts who worried that Yemen would be the \\"first country to run out of water\\". Agriculture in Yemen takes up about 90% of water in Yemen even though it only generates 6% of GDP - however a large portion of Yemenis are dependent on small-scale subsistence agriculture. Half of agricultural water in Yemen is used to grow khat, a narcotic that most Yemenis chew. This means that in such a water-scarce country as Yemen, where half the population is food-insecure, 45% of the water withdrawn from the ever-depleting aquifers is used to grow a crop that feeds nobody. This water insecurity has a direct impact on political stability. Outsiders hear most about the proxy war between factions supported by other countries, but according to the Yemeni newspaper Al-Thawra, 70% to 80% of conflicts in the country's rural regions are water-related. The country's Interior Ministry has estimated that across the country, water and land related disputes kill 4,000 people a year - more than terrorism. In Al- Jawf Governorate, a dispute over a well's placement has led to a blood feud that has continued for more than 30 years In 2007, Yemen's minister of Water and Natural Resources suggested that the Sana'a might have to be evacuated if it runs out of water.Kirby, Alex:\\"Yemen's khat habit soaks up water.\\" BBC News, Sana‚Äôa, 7 April 2007 Although the government was unable to move the capital in an orderly and peaceful way, the war and political crisis has rendered Sana'a and most of Yemen into a battleground that people have been forced to flee. Additional environmental catastrophes have battered Yemen as the war has progressed. In late 2015, two historic cyclones struck the country. The first of these, Cyclone Chapala, struck the island of Socotra before hitting the port of Mukalla on Yemen's south coast, where it caused catastrophic flash flooding. This storm, combined with the following Cyclone Megh, left enough moisture in the soil for locusts to breed. These locusts can fly 100 miles in a day and destroy any crop they encounter. History =Revolution (2011‚Äì12)= Yemen's political crisis began in 2011, amid the Arab Spring and the ongoing Houthi insurgency. Protests against Saleh Protesters in Sana'a on 4 April 2011, during the early stages of the Yemeni Revolution. Popular protests broke out in early 2011, led by both secular and Islamist opposition groups. Longtime rebel groups like the Houthis and the Southern Movement also participated in the protests. Saleh responded with a violent crackdown, and the country nearly disintegrated into an all-out civil war as several army elements broke with the government and joined the protesters, beginning in March. Saleh was almost killed when a bomb went off in a mosque where he and other top government officials were praying on 3 June, apparently in an assassination attempt. While his condition initially appeared grave, Saleh recovered and returned to work on 23 September after several months of medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. He left Vice President Hadi in charge during his absence. As acting president, Hadi met with the opposition and reportedly expressed openness to political reforms. However, he rejected the idea of forcing Saleh from power without the president's consent. Deal brokered The Gulf Co-operation Council applied no small amount of pressure on Saleh to negotiate an end to the uprising by stepping down. Weeks after returning from Saudi Arabia, Saleh finally agreed on 23 November to resign in exchange for immunity. As part of the deal, the opposition agreed to allow Hadi to stand unopposed for the presidency in 2012. Siege of Dammaj Meanwhile, the insurgent Houthis in northern Yemen laid siege to a Salafi town in Saada Governorate, Dammaj. Fighting was worst in November and December. The Yemeni military was unable to restore order due to the crisis elsewhere in the country. =Transitional period (2012‚Äì14)= The Yemeni Revolution came to an apparently successful conclusion in 2012 for the opposition, as Saleh left office. However, unrest continued in both northern and southern Yemen. Election of Hadi Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, the second President of Yemen. Hadi's election on 24 February 2012 peacefully introduced a new government in Yemen, with only a small percentage of voters spoiling their ballots in the single-candidate contest. Hadi, a southerner, especially enjoyed support in former South Yemen, quieting the murmurs of separatism, although the Southern Movement boycotted the presidential election, as did the Houthis. Hadi did not give the restive Houthis any seats in his cabinet. Dammaj clashes continue The conflict in Dammaj was renewed in April when fighting broke out between Houthi tribesmen and Salafi students. Both sides accused the other of breaking a truce agreement. Hadi makes inroads National reconciliation talks were held with the participation of many separatist elements, as well as the Houthis. Nine years after the death of Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, the Yemeni government turned over the remains of the Houthi patriarch to his family and he was buried in northern Yemen in June 2013, with a representative of the Hadi administration in attendance. Hadi visited the United States, a key overseas ally, in July 2013. The U.S. also lifted a ban on transferring detainees from its Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba to Yemen. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia deported as many as 300,000 to 400,000 Yemeni migrant workers to their home country during 2013, causing an influx of poor, landless Yemenis into northern Yemen. Renewed clashes The conflict between Houthis and Salafis in Saada Governorate was renewed in October and November. Saada government officials accused Houthi fighters of attacking a Salafi mosque in Dammaj in an attempt to drive the Sunnis out, while the Houthis accused the Salafis of using the religious institute as a staging ground for foreign Sunni fighters. The government attempted to intervene to stop the fighting. Sectarian fighting in Al Jawf Governorate lasted throughout the year. Dhamar Governorate also saw clashes between the Houthis and Salafis toward the end of the year. =Houthi rebellion (2014‚Äì15)= In a dramatic turn of events, the rebel Houthis took broad control of northern Yemen, including the capital of Sana'a itself, in 2014. Shia‚ÄìSunni conflict spreads Clashes in Dammaj spread to the Amran Governorate by January 2014. The Houthis achieved victory in Saada when the Yemeni government brokered a deal under which Salafi fighters and their families were evacuated to the neighboring Al Hudaydah Governorate. According to reports, the Houthis then blocked government troops from fully deploying throughout the territory, in spite of a signed agreement. Fighting in the Amran Governorate intensified during the year, with clashes between Houthis and supporters of the Islamist Islah Party eventually leading to a Houthi takeover of the entire governorate. The conflict spread to the Sana'a Governorate by July. Houthis take Sana'a The Houthis began protesting against Hadi's government to demand concessions in order to resolve a years- long insurgency they had been waging against the Yemeni state in mid-2014. The uprising escalated dramatically as Houthi fighters swept into Sana'a, the capital, and effectively seized control of the city from the Yemeni military within a couple of days in September. The forces of General Ali Mohsen al- Ahmer surrendered to the Houthis after a brief fight. Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president, was widely suspected of aiding the Houthis behind the scenes and helping pave the way for their takeover. Prime Minister Mohammed Basindawa resigned on 21 September as part of a deal meant to end the standoff. Unity government formed The Houthis and the government agreed on 21 September to form a \\"unity government\\" within one month. However, the Houthis rejected Hadi's original choice of prime minister, Ahmad Awad bin Mubarak, and Oil Minister Khaled Bahah was appointed instead with the armed group's approval. The Houthis and the General People's Congress led by Saleh announced abruptly on 8 November that they would not participate in the unity government, claiming it was unacceptable to them. The boycott prompted sanctions against Saleh and senior Houthi leaders from the United Nations Security Council and the United States Department of the Treasury. =War in Yemen (2015‚Äìpresent)= Yemen was riven in 2015, with the Houthis establishing a new government in Sana'a and Hadi retreating with his supporters to Aden, and later Saudi Arabia. The Arab League, led by the Saudis, began a bombing campaign and mobilization of various armed forces in the region for a possible invasion. Houthis consolidate power Houthi official announces the dissolution of House of Representatives and the formation of a Houthi-led transitional authority on 6 February 2015. The Houthis stepped up their pressure on Hadi's weakened government, seizing the presidential palace and strategic military installations in Sana'a and shelling the president's private residence on 20 January. The following day, they took control of Hadi's home, stationing armed guards outside to keep him under virtual house arrest. Hadi, Prime Minister Khaled Bahah, and the cabinet resigned the following day, saying they could not continue to work under the conditions the Houthis had imposed. The rebel group welcomed Hadi's resignation, but continued to keep him under house arrest. The news prompted four southern governorates to announce they would disregard all orders from Sana'a. The House of Representatives was to meet on 25 January to discuss whether to accept or reject Hadi's resignation under the Yemeni constitution, but the session was cancelled after the Houthis took control of the parliament building. The United Nations stepped in to attempt a negotiated resolution to what many in Yemen regarded as a Houthi coup. UN negotiations were fruitless, and a Houthi ultimatum to Yemen's political factions to find a solution was not met. On 6 February, the Houthis declared themselves in total control of the Yemeni government, dissolving parliament and installing a Revolutionary Committee led by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi to lead the state in an interim capacity. The announcement sparked protests in Sana'a and other cities, especially in the south. Post-coup developments Reactions to the Houthi takeover were broadly negative, with the Arab League, Gulf Cooperation Council, United Nations, and United States refusing to recognise the \\"constitutional declaration\\" and several governorates rejecting the Houthis' authority. With most political parties criticising the coup, Jamal Benomar, the UN envoy to Yemen, announced a resumption of national talks over the future of Yemen on 8 February. Benomar said the Houthis had agreed to participate in the talks. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for Hadi to be reinstated as president. The Houthis and other factions reached a tentative agreement, announced on 20 February, to keep the House of Representatives in place despite the \\"constitutional declaration\\" dissolving it two weeks prior. The agreement also stipulated that a \\"people's transitional council\\" would be established to represent southerners, women, youth, and other political minorities. The next day, Hadi traveled to Aden, where he said all Houthi- directed actions since 21 September 2014 were invalid, and condemned the coup d'√©tat. Civil war erupts Fighting broke out over Aden International Airport on 19 March, with special forces loyal to ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh attempting to seize the airport before they were defeated by troops and militiamen under orders from the Hadi administration. The following day, in an apparently unrelated incident, four suicide bombers detonated themselves in Sana'a mosques packed with Houthi congregants, killing at least 142. The Sunni Islamist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's Yemen branch claimed responsibility. Hadi declared Aden to be Yemen's temporary capital on 21 March while Sana'a remains under Houthi control. The next day, Houthi forces advanced toward Aden, capturing key parts of Yemen's third city of Taiz. They consolidated their grip on much of the south and seized much of Aden itself by early April. =Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen= On 26 March 2015, Saudi Arabia and several other countries announced that they had begun military operations in Yemen against Houthi rebels. Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates issued a statement along with Saudi Arabia saying their goal is to \\"repel Houthi aggression\\" in Yemen. Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Sudan are also members of the coalition. In addition to airstrikes against targets throughout Yemen, which the General People's Congress blamed for causing dozens of civilian casualties, Egyptian warships reportedly shelled a Houthi column as it advanced toward Aden on 30 March, and Saudi and Houthi forces traded artillery and rocket fire across the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The 8 October 2016 attack by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition killed at least 140 people and injured more than 600 in Sana'a. This was one of the single worst death tolls in the two-year war. Saudi Arabia and its allies accepted the internal review's finding, by the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT), that the coalition's bombardment of this funeral ceremony was based on faulty information, i.e., that this was a gathering of armed Houthi leaders. Cholera epidemic A severe cholera epidemic has begun in Yemen during the civil war. In July 2017, the United Nations Humanitarian Relief coordinator said that over 320,000 cases had been reported. He also blamed the epidemic on the war and on international forces supporting the combatants. As of October 2017, it was already described as the worst cholera outbreak in recorded history, with over 800,000 cases.  Humanitarian Crisis  Over one third of the three million refugees have been uprooted within Yemen between 2015 and 2020.

The book addresses causes of the rapid increase in U.S. incarceration rates since the 1970s and of racial inequality in the U.S. prison system. Specifically, Murakawa traces the role of liberal politicians, particularly national-level Democrats, in shaping racially unequal incarceration policies. For the book, Murakawa was awarded the Michael Harrington Book Award by the New Political Science section of the APSA in 2015. Murakawa's approach specifically \\"discounts intentions, recognizing that racial power is not necessarily exerted by will.\\" Instead the book investigates differing forms of racism and how they have functionally influenced the U.S. prison system. According to Murakawa, Democratic efforts to professionalize the U.S. justice system in response to racial bias in policing effectively contributed to that racially discriminatory policing and imprisonment practices. Examples discussed include the Boggs Act of 1952 and the Narcotic Control Act of 1956 which both created mandatory sentencing, a policy that would entail racial inequality during the War on Drugs. More recently, Bill Clinton's 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill, which was heavily supported by Joe Biden, expanded the federal death penalty and minimum sentencing, which has been disproportionately applied to racial minorities. Minimum sentencing and drug laws have also significantly increased incarceration rates for nonviolent offenders. Murakawa notes that the term \\"the first civil right\\" was first used in the Truman administration to refer to the right to be protected from violence, specifically black protection from white supremacist violence, but the term was later popularized by Nixon to implicitly mean protection of white people from black people.

The surname Tobin derives from 't√≥ib√≠n', the Irish version of St Aubyn, which is of Norman-French origin. The Anglo-French St Aubyn family arrived in Ireland in the wake of the Norman Invasion in the 12th century and settled in Counties Tipperary and Kilkenny, and subsequently spread to the neighbouring counties of Cork and Waterford. By the 1440s there were three major Tobin clans established in south east Tipperary, as well as the senior line in Kilkenny. The Tobins were an eminent family in County Tipperary in medieval times, and the head of the family was known as the Baron of Coursey, although this was not an officially recognised title. The 14th century Annals of Ireland, by Kilkenny Franciscan John Clyn, described the Tobins' as 'a turbulent sect more dreaded by the English than the native Irish'. Ballytobin in Co. Kilkenny, Ireland is named after them. It means Tobins' town and may indicate their exact origin. A branch of the family who were among the Wild Geese, settled at Nantes in the country of origin, and the best known of these was Edmund Marquis de Tobin (1692 - 1747), who was killed in action in the War of Austrian Succession. Another branch of the Tobins' settled in Newfoundland and prospered there.

Zagata, who had previously worked in the software industry, was inspired to design the bicycles after his move to Brooklyn and subsequent infatuation with the borough left him wanting to explore more of the neighborhood. The final push to start the company occurred during a trip to Vietnam where he saw utility bicycles being used to transport vast amounts of goods. His first design, the Brooklyn Cruiser, was offered for sale in August 2011, and was deliberately designed to function as a city bicycle for urban everyday use, unlike the off-road mountain bike or the road bicycle. In 2012, CNN named the Brooklyn Cruiser one of \\"the coolest commutes on two wheels\\". The company proved very successful, with one million dollar plus revenue projected for 2013. In 2013, two new models were launched titled Franklin and Bedford. Brooklyn Bicycle Co. moved into more versatile models in 2016 with the release of their Lorimer women‚Äôs hybrid bike and Roebling men‚Äôs hybrid bike. As of 2017, there are eight different collections to choose from. The bicycles have been showcased as fashionable options in publications such as Vogue where in 2012, a \\"Willow blue\\" bike was presented as an ideal match for a Thakoon Panichgul dress. In 2013 a limited edition red Brooklyn Cruiser was selected by the Museum of Modern Art for sale through their shop. The 2013 model, designed in collaboration with Grant Petersen (of Rivendell Bicycle Works) was influenced by Raleigh's 1950s bicycles. In 2016, Bicycle Magazine named the Wythe one of the year's Best City Bikes, and in that same year The Coolist listed the Wythe as one of the Best Commuter Bikes.

Founded in Pennsylvania in 2006, it is an online seller of fishing flies in the United States. History The company's beginnings started out of a truck where Kory Van Tassel spent downtime tying flies one dozen at a time as he waited for customers he was guiding on the rivers of central and western Pennsylvania. While building the initial customer base he worked for another successful store, the Neshannock Creek Fly Shop,http://www.ncflyshop.com/news.stm which sat on prime Blue Ribbon trout fishing. He would take long junkets up to New York for steelhead guiding, and after fishing a client all day would set up a vice tying late into the night in cheap motels trying to keep up, before getting up at 4 A.M. to drive to the next spot and set up for the day. Eventually the demand grew to the point he could no longer keep up on his own and began to search for additional tiers to fulfill demand. At the same time he realized that he could only reach a limited number of customers within a small radius of his region invested in a website, www.theflystop.com, to try and expand the market he could reach. After seeing some great initial success he relocated the business to Colorado, continuing to service the East Coast through dedicated customer service and long hours to keep up in both time zones. The business expanded slower than expected in Colorado and after a series of unfortunate business dealings migrated back to its roots in Pennsylvania. In 2012 Matthew Austinhttp://askaboutflyfishing.com/speakers/matt-austin/matt-austin.cfm was brought in as a temporary consultant to the company and was later invited to join as Director of Marketing and E-commerce. This key hire would serve as a turning point in the direction of the company and led to the technologization of many of the companies infrastructure and fulfillment processes, re- branding, expansion of core business arena and growth into additional markets in California.

Its history precedes that of the BPL itself. In 1852, prominent citizens established the Brooklyn Athenaeum and Reading Room for the instruction of young men. In 1857, a group of young men established the Brooklyn Mercantile Library Association of the City of Brooklyn, which shared a building with the Athenaeum. The Mercantile Library attempted to be more practical, placing less emphasis on Literature and philosophy. The librarian in charge was Stephen Buttrick Noyes. In 1866, he went to work at the Library of Congress. In 1869, the Mercantile Library and the Athenaeum consolidated their holdings and moved to a new building, the Montague Street Branch Library. Also in 1869, Noyes returned, and one of his labors on his return was the preparation of a catalog, which was issued in 1881. In 1878, the Mercantile Library was renamed the Brooklyn Library. By 1943, the Business Reference Department was known as the Business Library. The library outgrew its space, and in 1957, a new building to house both the Business Library and the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood branch was approved by city government. On June 1, 1962, the new $2.5 million library building opened its doors to the public at its current location. In 1993, a two-year renovation and expansion was completed; the renovated building housed both the Brooklyn Heights branch and Business & Career Library. In 2013, BPL announced its intent to sell 280 Cadman Plaza West, and as part of this announcement, the Business and Career Library's functions were relocated to BPL's Central Branch. BPL then sold the branch to developer Hudson Companies. Hudson Companies then demolished the structure and replaced it with a 34-story condominium, which would contain a smaller Brooklyn Heights branch library at its base when it is completed in 2020. In the interim, the BPL opened a temporary branch at 109 Remsen Street.

It is an adaptation of the short fictional story popularized in Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates, about a boy who plugs a leaking dike with his finger to prevent it from bursting. The role of the boy was played by Marie Eline, but little else is known about the production and cast of the film. The director may have been Barry O'Neil and the writer may have been Lloyd Lonergan. Parts of the film were shot on Glen Park Island in New Rochelle, New York. The film was released on June 17, 1910 and saw a wide release, including the United Kingdom. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: \\"Hans is a little Dutch boy, the son of a poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed with the fact that the safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water is pouring. Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, he sticks his tiny finger in the hole, and waits for someone to come to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not worry about him. In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film was an adaptation of the fictional story that was popularized in Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates. The name of the boy, Hans, may be a reference to the erroneous association to unnamed character in the book. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Many of the scenes for the film were shot at Glen Park in New Rochelle, New York. Only Marie Eline's credit as Hans, the young boy, is credited. Eline had previously played an Italian boy in The Two Roses. The other members cast may have included the leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.  Release  The single reel drama, approximate 650 feet long, was released on June 17, 1910. Some trade publications list the length of the film as 1000 feet though. The United Kingdom release of the film may have had the name of the hero changed to Peter. A synopsis in The Bioscope on October 27, 1910 refers to the hero by the name Peter. This alternative name for the hero of the story can be found in the 1910 publication of Reader 1st-4th by D. Appleton and Company. A review in The Moving Picture World was neutral because it lacked specific praise or criticism of the production. The film had a wide release, advertisements for the showing in theaters include those in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Missouri. The film is presumed lost.

It dates to the early Cycladic period, between the 28th and 23 centuries BC (EC II). The frying pan derives from grave 74 of Chalandriani cemetery on the Cycladian island of Syros. It was discovered in 1889/90 during excavations led by Christos Tsountas, along with other pottery and was first published by Tsountas in 1899. With the inventory number 4974, the frying pan is now kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. The purpose of the frying pan is unknown.  Description  Decorated reverse Decorated reverse and view from above, 1899 The frying pan is 20.1 cm across and 28.2 cm from tip to grip. The plate has a round wall which is undecorated and projects outwards, forming the dish of the \\"frying pan\\". The incised decoration on the reverse is very deep. The entire plate, with the grips, is surrounded by a border of chip impressions. At the base of the handle, above the grips is an engraved pubic triangle. It is separated from the main field by another chip border. In the main field, stamped spirals, linked together by engraved lines, surround a ship which is engraved slightly below centre, opposite the handle. The hull and an upward pointing prow are depicted by engraved double lines. There is a fish symbol and two banners on the high prow. Above and below the hull, oars or rudders are suggested by slanting lines - a different number on each side.Coleman 1976 in Thimme, p. 116; Coleman 1985, p. 208; Rambach Table 28 A unique feature compared to other frying pans is the orientation of the ship.

It is made of a dark red, strong and coarse- grained clay. The slip on the outside is well-applied, but slightly spotty. On the inside, it is darker.

Meaning  Frying pans of the \\"Chalandriani type\\" are part of the final development of this form of ceramics and are dated to FC II. Their predecessors of the \\"Aplomata type\\" differ clearly in the tendency to circular bodies and in grip shape. By contrast, the frying pans of the \\"Chalandriani type\\" have an oval body and usually have little footed handles.
