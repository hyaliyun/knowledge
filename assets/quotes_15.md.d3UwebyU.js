It was founded as a German-style gymnasium (i.e., a combined high school and junior college) in Perry County, Missouri, in 1839. It was moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1847, and ultimately to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1861. In 1935, the high school department of the school was separated from the junior college to form Concordia Lutheran High School. Concordia College was closed in 1957 when the LCMS opened Concordia Senior College on a new campus in Fort Wayne..The former campus was purchased by the Indiana Institute of Technology.  History = Beginnings in Perry County, Missouri  In 1839, a group of Lutherans immigrated from Saxony, Germany in order to more freely practice their religion and settled in Perry County and in St. Louis, Missouri. That summer, three candidates for the ministry who had not yet been assigned to a congregation, Johann F. Buenger, Ottomar Fuerbringer, and Theodor Brohm, began construction of a one and a half story log cabin in the Dresden settlement just south of Altenburg. Buenger was the lead proponent for the project. Those three men along with C. F. W. Walther, the pastor of the Dresden congregation, were the owners, faculty, and administrators of the school. Given the extreme poverty in which the newly- arrived settlers found themselves, it was difficult to raise financial and other support for the project. On August 13, 1839, an advertisement in the Anzeiger des Westens, the principal German language newspaper in St. Louis, announced the establishment a German gymnasium in Perry County, with a scheduled opening date of October 1, 1839. However, the school did not actually open until December 9, 1839, due to lack of equipment and funds. The initial enrollment included four girls (ages 5 to 12) and seven boys (ages 7 to 15). The purpose of the school, as shown by the composition of the student body, was to provide a classical education to all children in the settlement. By May 1841, Buenger and Fuerbringer had left the settlement to serve as pastors elsewhere, and Brohm and Walther were unable to teach full time due to illness. Later that year, the school was moved to a log cabin in Altenburg; that cabin is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Concordia Log Cabin College. When Brohm accepted a pastorate in New York in May 1843, Gotthold H. Loeber, the pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in Altenburg, became the head of the school. In 1843, Trinity congregation in St. Louis, where Walther was now pastor, began supplying seven dollars per month in financial support, while the Perry County settlers provided a teacher residence, food, and other supplies. Under Loeber, the focus of the school changed to that of preparing pastors and teachers, with seminary training being added to the gymnasium curriculum. During the school's existence in Perry County, it was known variously as Luther College and the Altenberg Seminary. It may have also been known as Concordia College, but there is no conclusive evidence that it was known there by that name.  Relocation to St. Louis  When the LCMS was founded in 1847, one of its main purposes was to provide training for pastors and teachers to serve the congregations. It was decided that it would be better for the synod to acquire the existing school in Altenburg rather than to establish a new one. After negotiations involving the synod and the congregations in both Perry County and St. Louis, it was agreed that the urban setting of St. Louis would provide a better location. In December 1849, the college and seminary, with nine students and one teacher, relocated to temporary quarters in that city, with the LCMS assuming ownership in October 1850. A new two-story building housing both the preparatory school and the seminary opened on a campus on South Jefferson Avenue in 1850. By the mid-1850s, the course of study consisted of six years in the preparatory school and three years of in the seminary. The preparatory school was structured as a German gymnasium, with six grades (Sexta, Quinta, Quarta, Tertia, Secunda, and Prima) corresponding to approximately four years of high school and two years of junior college in today's terminology. One difference from the typical German gymnasium was that it was a boarding school. On February 23, 1853, the Missouri General Assembly granted a charter to the institution under the name \\"Concordia College\\", the charter and legal name under which the now separate Concordia Seminary continues to operate  Relocation to Fort Wayne  By 1860, the number of students in the preparatory school and seminary had increased, leading to overcrowding on the St. Louis campus. Already in the 1850s, proposals had been made to move the synod's practical seminary (today's Concordia Theological Seminary) from Fort Wayne to St. Louis to share quarters with Concordia Seminary, with the preparatory school taking over the practical seminary's campus in Fort Wayne. The practical seminary had fewer students than the preparatory school, so no additional facilities would be needed in St. Louis, and, while additional construction would be needed in Fort Wayne, building costs were lower there. The 1860 convention of the LCMS voted to proceed with that plan. The outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 caused the relocation to proceed more quickly than originally planned. Three professors, an assistant, and the 78 students {all male) of Concordia College moved to Fort Wayne in the summer of 1861, and classes began in September. However, inadequate housing due to the quickness of the move and a typhoid outbreak among both faculty and students made living conditions miserable. The campus inherited from the practical seminary contained two houses and the Seminary Building. The latter had cost $7,000 to construct and had been dedicated on October 25, 1857. The Seminary Building also housed the synod's teachers' college which had been relocated from Milwaukee, Wisconsin in that same year, but that school was soon moved off campus to relieve overcrowding. (The teachers' college, the forerunner of Concordia University Chicago, was relocated to Addison, Illinois, in 1864, and then to River Forest, Illinois, in 1913.) The students and classrooms occupied the three-story central section of the structure, while the two-story east and west wings were used as faculty residences. The college operated under the state charter for the German Theological Seminary (i.e., the practical seminary) that had been issued in 1850. A new charter for Concordia College of Fort Wayne that also legitimized that actions undertaken by the college while under the seminary charter was enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 1881. Recognizing that additional space would be needed in Fort Wayne, the 1860 convention resolution had authorized $20,000 for that purpose. Four additional lots on the north side of campus were purchased for $1,140 in April 1863. That same year, the \\"Oak Grove\\" on the west side was purchased for $2,400. A house for the school's director and a duplex for two faculty were also built in that year, freeing up the space in the Seminary Building that they formerly occupied. Finally, three lots in the northeast corner of the campus were obtained in 1872. The resulting campus encompassed the area bounded by what are now Maumee Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Anthony Avenue, and Schick Street. Excavation for what eventually was named Hanser Hall began in 1863, but work was halted due to the Civil War and lack of funding. Work resumed in 1869, but the building was not completed and equipped until 1872. The four story building contained student housing on the upper stories and an auditorium-chapel called the Aula on the second. Completion of Hanser Hall resolved the overcrowding conditions, but not before conditions had worsened on December 28, 1869, when a fire in the Seminary Building destroyed the central section and severely damaged the east wing. The building suffered $5,000 in damages, and the students lost $4,000 in possessions. As a result of the fire, some students moved to other buildings on the campus, and 100 were lodged in private homes. During the 1860s, complaints had been made in the synod regarding the conditions under which the students lived. Although those complaints were found generally to be unfounded, the complaints persisted. On July 12, 1866, synod president C. F. W. Walther indicated his support for the college's director, G. Alexander Saxer, who had held the position since 1858 and took a stern approach toward discipline. However, the fire and ensuing events increased the discontent, resulting in an official synodical investigation in 1872. As a result of the continuing complaints, Saxer and most of the faculty resigned during the next two years. The new director, Carl Johann Otto Hanser, took a more fatherly approach to the students. Enrollment increased to about 300 students, but his requests to the synod for assistance were not heeded, leading Hanser to becoming physically exhausted and ultimately resigning in 1879. None of the four directors who followed Hanser served for more than eight years.  Twentieth century  During Martin H. Luecke's 24 years as director (1902‚Äì1926), several new building were constructed. In 1905, a second classroom building, Schick Hall, was erected. The two-and-a-half story brick building cost $44,251.60 and contained a library and an auditorium on the second floor. A covered bridge the students called the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" connected Schick Hall to Hanser Hall. The new library and auditorium In Schick Hall allowed the library and Aula in Hanser Hall to be repurposed. In 1911, an additional floor was built between the floor and ceiling of the Aula for more dormitory space. In 1906, the school won the approval of the U.S. War Department to create a military department with a commandant assigned by the U.S. Army, thereby becoming a military academy. The college's main objective was to provide the students with organized physical education along with the discipline that a military program instilled. The structure of the program remained essentially unchanged until 1954, when the college-level section was dropped and the high school section became a Junior ROTC. unit. Enrollment continued to increase, necessitating the construction of two residence halls. Sihler Hall was built in 1924 at a cost of $123.249.11, and Crull Hall, in 1925, for $112,152,05. The nearly identical three-story buildings each accommodated 104 students. The 1950 LCMS convention decided to add pre-teacher training of both men and women at the college. Residential female students were therefore first admitted that fall. Two of the faculty residences were converted to women's dorms: Martha Hall in 1950 and Sina Hall in 1953.  Concordia Lutheran HIgh School  From early on, enrollment in Concordia was restricted to young men intending to go into the pastoral ministry. However, even the 1911 college catalog stated that the course of studies was also useful for those going into all other professions. In 1920, the leaders of the Fort Wayne Luther Institute, a two-year business and secretarial school founded in 1916, proposed a merger with the college's high school department, and the faculty asked the synod to add courses not related to seminary training, but no merger occurred. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the synod actively encouraged such non-ministerial enrollments due to the decline in students who wanted to enter the seminaries and the corresponding decline in enrollment at Concordia and the other LCMS colleges. In 1934, the Luther Institute again proposed a merger, which, after detailed planning, was approved in February 1935, subject to approval by the LCMS. The synod's convention approved the proposal in September 1935. The merged institution, which was coeducational, was originally known as the Lutheran High School, with its name being officially changed to Concordia Lutheran High School in March 1955. Classes were originally held on the second and third floors of Hanser Hall after renovations paid for by the Lutheran churches in Fort Wayne. In September 1935, there were 205 ministerial and 96 non-ministerial students. Concordia College stopped admitting high school freshmen into its ministerial program in September 1951. A new high school building was opened in 1952 on leased from the college on the southeast corner of the campus, and in 1955, six more classrooms were added to the building.  Closure  Ministerial students graduating from Concordia College and the synod's other junior colleges usually enrolled directly in Concordia Seminary in St. Louis. Starting in the 1920s, unsuccessful proposals were made to convert the synod's junior colleges into four-year colleges, which would be similar to the structure of theological education in other American denominations. In 1935, the synod convention voted to add a fourth year to the seminary curriculum, but in 1947, the synod decided instead to create a senior college that students would attend between junior college and seminary. In 1951, a committee of Concordia College leaders and local LCMS pastors urged that the senior college be located in Fort Wayne. In January 1953, a synodical committee recommended instead that the senior college be located in either Chicago or Milwaukee and had even taken an option on a site near Chicago, but the synod's convention in Houston later that year voted to locate it in Fort Wayne. The resolution also required the closure of Concordia College and the sale of its campus, with the proceeds helping to fund the construction of Concordia Senior College at a new campus. Negotiations for sale of the campus to the Indiana Technical College had begun already in 1952. In addition to the approximately $1 million from the sale, $400,000 that had been earmarked for improvements at the old campus were directed to the senior college construction. Approximately of land containing the high school building and two faculty residences in the southeast corner of the campus were transferred to Concordia High School and not included in the sale. That parcel was later also sold to Indiana Tech when the high school moved to a new campus in 1964. The high school building is now Indiana Tech's Cunningham Business Center. Academic buildings Hanser Hall and Schick Hall and dormitories Crull Hall and Sihler Hall were used by Indiana Tech for a number of years, but have since been demolished. The original plan was to vacate the old campus by July 1, 1955, but construction delays pushed that date to June 30, 1956. The final year of classes for the junior college was conducted at the new campus, with the final graduation ceremony on May 26, 1957, and a \\"Farewell to Concordia College\\" service on June 12. Concordia Senior College was designated as the legal and historical successor to Concordia College.  Curriculum  From the school's inception until the 1930s, the curriculum at Concordia College (and at the other pre-seminary schools of the LCMS) followed the pattern of the German gymnasium, with a heavy emphasis on the classical languages of Latin and Greek and, in the final (Prima) year, Hebrew. Most courses were conducted in Latin and the rest in German, except for English language classes. As was typical of the German model of education, instructors were given little flexibility in teaching techniques and students were expected to obediently master the material. Students had 30 to 35 periods of instruction each week, even in the junior college department. The textbooks were the same ones used in Germany, although by 1900, some American textbooks in mathematics and the sciences began to be used. By the early 1900s, the use of English among the membership of the LCMS was becoming more common, and the use of German was declining. This caused difficulties for students at Concordia, where German was still assumed to be common language. The language issue became even more complicated in 1921, when the Slovak Evangelical Lutheran Church began sending its pre-seminary students to Concordia, necessitating the addition of Slovak- language classes. Notices began appearing in the college catalogs in the 1920s that emphasized the expectation for students to become fluent in German and Latin. In 1920, the synod's convention directed that the American terminology of \\"high school\\" and \\"junior college\\" be used for the first four and last two years, respectively, of the pre-seminary schools, and in 1935, when the high school department merged with the Luther Institute, Concordia officially replaced the Latin names of the classes (Sexta, Quinta, Quarta, Tertia, Secunda, and Prima) with the American equivalents (high school freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior, and college freshman and sophomore). Several studies at the synodical level of the LCMS examined the educational structure and content of the LCMS colleges and seminaries. In 1938, the synod convention adopted a resolution to restructure the curriculum at Concordia and the other colleges. Latin and German were de-emphasized, the study of Greek was restricted to the junior college years, and the study of Hebrew was moved exclusively to the seminaries. More instructional time was given to social studies and the natural sciences. Moreover, the student class load at the junior college level was reduced to 15‚Äì18 hours of classroom time per week, as was common in most American colleges. Beginning in 1952, graduates were awarded an Associates of Arts degree. Prior to that they had received only a diploma.  Athletics  Baseball was first played at Concordia in 1867. Opponents consisted of local and nearby independent teams until the school joined the Indiana Intercollegiate Conference sometime after that body's establishment in 1922. Competition after that was limited to other colleges, most of which were four-year institutions. Several Concordia team members, including Max Carey and Bill Wambsganss, later played in Major League baseball. The first basketball team was formed in 1909, and contained members from both the high school and the college departments. This was the same year a new gymnasium had been constructed, replacing the school's first gym that had measured only . However, the roof trusses of the new gym were low enough that some shots had to be threaded through them. In 1928, the gym was renovated and the floor was lowered several feet. The high school and college teams had several successful seasons. For example, in 1953 the college team (known as the Cavaliers) participated in the National Junior College Athletic Association's basketball tournament. Football was played in the early 1900s, but was discontinued due to the death of a player. However, the sport was revived from 1926 until 1932, when it was again dropped due to the expense, injuries, and lack of other junior college competition. The team won only one game in those six years. Until the 1920s, administrative regulations at Concordia prevented its teams from playing against other schools, either at home or away, except for Culver Military Academy, which, like Concordia, was a military academy.  Directors and presidents  When the college was part of the same institution as the seminary, the title of the head of the school was that of \\"director\\". This continued even after the relocation to Fort Wayne. During the first part of the twentieth century, the title of \\"president\\" became more commonly used, and became official during the term of William C. Burhop. * Adolph Biewend (1856‚Äì1858) * G.

He is the CEO of the company CyberConnect2. He developed multiple games including the .hack franchise as well as adaptations of the anime series including Naruto and Dragon Ball. Besides developing games, Matsuyama has participated in directing two .hack films as well as voicing a character from the series. Early life As a child, Matsuyama was interested in anime and manga. He dreamed of becoming a mangaka for the Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. When growing up, he graduated from a university in Fukuoka. Following his graduation, Matsuyama joined a manga club. He went to Kyushu Sangyo University but had no decided what would be his job. Believing he was naive, Matsuyama became an employee for a cement company. He later joined a friend who was working for Taito in Tokyo. Around this time, Matsuyama decided to work for a game company. They gathered in Fukuoka, and started the company called CyberConnect. By the time he became a developer, the manga Naruto was his favorite series but he stated that other series including Bleach, Beelzebub, and One Piece were among second best. Career He gathered with designers of action games from Taito including Psychic Force and RayStorm. Despite being originally an illustrator, Matsuyama became a game designer. CyberConnect, now composed of ten people, worked on Tail Concerto and Silent Bomber which brought him difficulties due to time demand. The team was disappointed with the low sales of these two games. In 2000 the CEO of CyberConnect left the team. This led to the company changing their name to CyberConnect2. Still composed of ten people, the company ought to create a new video game that would not be demanding within the company. Matsuyama commented on their audience, stating that the players will not look after the amount of designers behind a game, but instead the content produced. .hack Matsuyama played a key role in developing the concept for the .hack series. A number of core ideas, including \\"slaying dragons or being a thief in London\\" were explored, but these were rejected in favor of an \\"offline/online game\\". Matsuyama said that this would give young gamers an opportunity to experience online play without paying monthly fees or needing powerful Internet connections. The developers looked at a number of massively multiplayer online role-playing games such as Phantasy Star Online, Ultima Online, and Final Fantasy XI for inspiration, and drew influences from the prior works of character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Neon Genesis Evangelion) and scenario writer Kazunori It≈ç (Ghost in the Shell). It≈ç noted that casting the player into the role of a subscriber of The World creates a unique story-telling situation which draws the player deeper into the plot. Matsuyama theorized that the act of transferring saved data across the four volumes would help to create a sense of the human drama embodied by the games' story and invest the player into the narrative. Development for .hack//G.U. began in October 2002, with Hiroshi Matsuyama as director. As in the previous games, Matsuyama also appears as a character that the player meets, this time being Piros the 3rd. Matsuyama claimed that Rebirth was longer than the four games of the first series combined and that the three .hack//G.U. games would not be \\"three parts to the same game\\". Matsuyama considered Kite as a relatable character and thus wanted the next game to feature a different take of lead character for .hack//G.U., Haseo. While .hack and .hack//Sign were conceived as two ongoing an connected projects, Matsuyama wanted to do the same with .hack//GU. However, Matsuyama wanted both .hack//G.U. and .hack//Roots to feature the same lead character, Haseo. However, he found it might come across as challenging to make the writing make both stay true to the original writing. The director also designed the character's hair to make it come across as an immature high school student. When doing this, Matsuyama conceived the idea of the Haseo's Xth form from the third game of the series that would affect not only his PC's body armor but also his hair to come across as a subtle change in his growth. Still finding difficulties in writing this, Matsuyama received help through writer Tatsuya Hamasaki who wrote the part of the series' script. For the CGI movie, .hack//G.U. Trilogy, Matsuyama wanted him to be given more realisitc expressions, resulting in alterations to his design. Matsuyama wanted the film to deeply focus on Haseo and Atoli's relationship. Additionally, with the film Matsuyama wanted to give Haseo another design as he felt retelling the story with the same abilities the character possessed would not attract returning fans. This was called \\"B-st Form\\" which occurs when Haseo loses his control when believing Atoli is killed. In trailers of the film, Haseo's B-st form was kept in secret to the point he joked they might be different characters. He also directed the 2012 film .hack//The Movie. Naruto: Ultimate Ninja series In order to promote games from the Naruto, Matsuyama cosplayed as Naruto Uzumaki in the 2012 Paris Marathon. Hiroshi Matsuyama, one of the creators of the game Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, commented that the staff wanted to try to remove the borderline between the anime and actual gameplay. They wanted to reach an effect where people actually look at the scenes as anime rather than a game. The core concept of the game is that of a one on one battle. Though the storyline from the game is based on the first 135 episodes of the anime series, the producers picked out key areas within the story, effectively forming a line from the first to the 135th episode. Matsuyama said that one of the most important battles he wanted to create in the sequel was the fight between Sasuke Uchiha and his brother, Itachi. Itachi was Matsuyama's favorite character and he felt emotional while developing the fight. Besides including the cast of Naruto in their older forms, the game features Lars Alexandersson from the Tekken fighting series. His design attracted Matsuyama who asked the Tekken staff if he could include Lars. Members from both the Naruto and Tekken games'staff were surprised by how well he fitted in with the cast. Although Lars does not have a story in the game, Matsuyama expected gamers to enjoy playing as him in regular battles and online gameplay. Matsuyama refrained from including downloadable content in the game. Because some young gamers were unable to play Storm 2 due to the price of consoles, a spin-off game, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact, was released on the handheld PlayStation Portable console so that it would be more accessible. Matsuyama also said that Naruto's Rasenshuriken was his favorite technique in the entire series due to its sounds as well as how the character executes it. Matsuyama also participated in the 2012 Paris Marathon while cosplaying as Naruto to celebrating the release of a new video game. For the spin-off Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution Masashi Kishimoto was the man responsible for new character \\"Mecha-Naruto\\" upon being suggested by the staff to include a new character. Kishimoto decided on adding a character that would bring a big impact to worldwide level which resulted in Mecha-Naruto. Matsuyama was surprised when seeing the new character. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 was developed for next generation consoles as a result of demand in video game marketing. Matsuyama gathered multiple members from the video game Revolution finding them suitable for developing Storm 4. Due to the departure from the previous generation of consoles, Matsuyama aimed to create a highly appealing Naruto game as he claims he is a big fan of the manga himself and wanted to give it a proper ending in video game form. In retrospective, Matsuyama reclaims having been surprised by reading the manga's final volume which inspired him to do the game. Upon seeing the final product, Matsuyama felt emotional over seeing the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke. Matsuyama also made his own sketch of two fighters, aiming to put them the video game, promising gamers they would enjoy the emotions delivered by the fight. Asura's Wrath Asura's Wrath was an action game CyberConnect2 developed with Capcom which was influenced by multiple anime series like Dragon Ball and Naruto. Final Fantasy VII: G-Bike The idea to create a mobile game based on Final Fantasy VII came from Square Enix producer Ichiro Hazama. Square Enix designated Hiroshi Matsuyama of CyberConnect2 as the game's director with oversight by Square Enix executive producer Yoshinori Kitase. Matsumaya described the early submission and evaluation processes with Square Enix's newly-established game screening department as \\"bumpy\\". In an aside during an interview, Matsuyama revealed that he asked Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto if he was interested in a Final Fantasy VII remake, but Hashimoto was not. Matsuyama interjected, \\"Well, if G-Bike is released and becomes a hit, let's make a Final Fantasy VII [remake]\\". Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot was supervised by Matsuyama who aimed to develop more anime based games following its release. Commentary Matsuyama claims that \\"Within the video game industry there are four things that are necessary: there is planning, there is graphics, there's sound, and then programming. These four things become the cornerstones of a video game.\\" Matsuyama expressed difficulties in featuring characters' deaths. He notes that while Harold from .hack is dead during the narrative, the one portrayed in the game is an A.I. whose original version was never seen. Similarly, the cast from .hack and .hack//G.U. do not die during the games but instead fall into comas when infected with a virus. However, with the release of the licensed game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Matsuyama found himself forced to write a death for the first time in his career since it was already executed in the manga version of Naruto. In this game, the character of Jiraiya dies in combat and the designer felt himself with the obligation of making it impressive towards the gamers and show a major impact despite being fiction. Matsuyama further reflected the anime's 133rd episode of Naruto to be one of his favorites not only for the action sequences between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha but also the emotional value displayed. Matsuyama has also talked about other games. He stated he would like to develop Mega Man Legends 3 as he was disappointed in the game's cancellation. He also criticized Sega that stop marketing their products if a person connected with their work is arrested as it happened in the first release of Judgment due to Pierre Taki being arrested in late 2018.

Origins of the Cave's Name The English name of this site refers to the seven sleepers who sought refuge in the cave, despite that accounts differ widely concerning the number of sleepers. The canonical Islamic text refers to seven sleeper and a dog. The site's Arabic name, , ', is based on the triliteral root , denoting writing or calligraphy. It may refer to the village or mountain that the cave is located in. It also may refer to the book that recorded the names of the seven sleepers, as is suggested in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's exegetical work Tafsir al-Tabari.

Schwarzman College of Computing is a college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Established in 2018 to address the growing applications of computing technology, the college is an Institute-wide academic unit that works alongside MIT's five Schools of Architecture and Planning, Engineering, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, Science, and Management. The college emphasizes artificial intelligence research, interdisciplinary applications of computing, and social and ethical responsibilities of computing. It aims to be an interdisciplinary hub for work in artificial intelligence, computer science, data science, and related fields. Its creation was the first significant change to MIT's academic structure since the early 1950s. The MIT Schwarzman College of Computing is named after The Blackstone Group chairman Stephen A. Schwarzman, who donated $350 million of the college's $1.1 billion funding commitment. The college's funding sources were met with criticism, with students and staff contrasting MIT's stated emphasis on ethics against Schwarzman's controversial business practices.  History  Stephen A. Schwarzman On October 15, 2018, MIT president L. Rafael Reif announced the creation of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. MIT described the initiative as its response to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and computing technology. The main part of the college's funding consisted of a $350 million gift from businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman, characterized by Forbes as one of the largest donations made to a single academic institution. The college was shaped by a several year long conversation between Reif and Schwarzman prior to the donation, where the two raised questions on the potential of AI and its future impacts on society. Schwarzman emphasized the global effects of AI and believed that America needed to invest further into developing the technology, and Reif desired a university-wide initiative that funds and promotes collaboration between departments. The resulting college sets a goal of educating \\"the bilinguals of the future\\", referring to students skilled in both computing and its applications to other fields. MIT also stated that the college would emphasize the ethics of AI and computing. On February 21, 2019, MIT announced Daniel P. Huttenlocher as the inaugural dean of the college. Huttenlocher was praised for his \\"educational creativity, instinctive collegiality, intellectual depth and breadth, institutional savvy, and industry experience\\". On February 26‚Äì28, 2019, MIT launched a three-day celebration of the college in an event named \\"Hello World, Hello MIT\\". The celebration featured panel discussions, an academic symposium, and talks from several notable figures. The speakers included Reif, Schwarzman, Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, author Thomas Friedman, and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The celebration received heavy criticism from several MIT students, faculty, and alumni, who protested the event and questioned the ethics of past actions by Schwarzman and Kissinger.  Academics = Organization  The Schwarzman College of Computing reshaped the organization of MIT, creating a new academic unit that interfaces between the university's five Schools of Architecture and Planning, Engineering, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, Science, and Management. Several existing departments were restructured as joint programs: the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science became a part of both the college and the School of Engineering, and the Operations Research Center became a part of both the college and the Sloan School of Management. The establishment of the college added 50 new faculty positions to the university. Half of these positions focus on computer science, while the other half are jointly appointed in collaboration with other academic departments. The New York Times described the college's structure as an effort to \\"alter traditional academic thinking and practice\\" and allow the university to more effectively bring computing to other fields.  Research labs  Interdepartmental research labs affiliated with the college include the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, the Quest for Intelligence, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health.  Focus areas  The MIT Schwarzman College of Computing introduces three additional integrated programs: * Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) aims to develop \\"responsible habits of mind and action\\" regarding computing technology. SERC facilitates the teaching of ethics throughout MIT courses, conducts research in social, ethical, and policy implications of technology, and coordinates public forums regarding technology and public policy. * Common Ground for Computing Education coordinates interdepartmental teaching in computing, supporting interdisciplinary courses, majors, and minors on computing and its applications. * Center for Advanced Studies of Computing hosts research fellows and assists project-oriented programs in computing-related topics.  Reception = Positive responses  MIT professor and AI researcher Patrick Winston praised the organization of the college and viewed it as an entity poised to serve \\"all of MIT\\". He expressed optimism regarding the college's long-term impacts, stating that he has \\"a very romantic dream of discoveries on par with those of Copernicus,... Darwin,... Watson and Crick\\". Some MIT students spoke positively regarding the college's potential to \\"better manage the overflowing major\\" of computer science. At the time of the college's establishment, roughly 40 percent of MIT undergraduates majored in computer science or a joint program involving computer science.  Negative responses  MIT's creation of the Schwarzman College of Computing led to several negative responses. A group of MIT students, faculty, and alumni issued a strong criticism against the university's decision to accept money from Schwarzman, deeming it to be unethical. In an opinion piece in The Tech, they condemned Schwarzman's relationship as an advisor to US President Donald Trump, his ties to Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and his firm's opposition to an affordable housing bill in California. Schwarzman's firm Blackstone responded that \\"advancing artificial intelligence responsibly is one of the most pressing challenges of our times and it should transcend politics\\". From another perspective, some students questioned the societal value of MIT's focus on computing and AI. Viewing MIT administrators' emphasis on these technologies as a fad, they argued that MIT should instead promote research and education in areas that they believed to be more impactful. \\"[Why] aren't we putting this large sum of money into our climate change research, our urban planning department, or our economics and political science departments?\\" wrote a student in an opinion piece in The Tech. Students also described MIT's initiative to create the college as \\"very top- down in its approach\\" and expressed skepticism regarding \\"buy-in from faculty, staff, and students\\". Outside of MIT, the Yale Daily News wrote that Schwarzman's donation to MIT \\"appeared to be a snub at Yale\\". The paper stated that an earlier donation to Yale for a $150 million Schwarzman Center led to similar controversies. The Schwarzman Center was viewed by its critics as \\"being driven by the donors rather than driven by the faculty and their mission\\". Schwarzman received his bachelor's degree from Yale in 1969.

After the Dade Massacre on December 28, 1835 the Second Seminole War was escalated with armed skirmishes and guerilla warfare. Early in the Second Seminole War, the strategically located town of Palatka, Florida Territory was attacked and burned by a group of Seminole Indians and their allies. Most surviving white settlers and black slaves fled to St. Augustine for safety, and the area was mostly abandoned except for free roaming groups of Seminole Indians and their allies.

General Worth remained in command of Fort Shannon until 1842 when he was promoted and assumed command of all the armies of Florida. This fortification was part of a network of forts that protected the strategically important transportation routes along the St. Johns River. Fort Shannon grew in size to include eight blockhouses, a hospital, several large wood framed buildings, officer‚Äôs barracks and a stables large enough to accommodate 400 horses. General Walker Keith Armistead divided his command into 3 districts: the St. Johns ‚Äì headquartered at Fort Shannon in Palatka; the Atlantic ‚Äì headquartered at Fort Marion in St. Augustine; and the Oklawaha ‚Äì headquartered at Fort King. Fort Shannon remained an important supply depot and headquarters where large numbers of troops could be housed, trained and deployed during the Second Seminole War. It was abandoned by the U.S. Army on August 24, 1843 after the Second Seminole War was over. Fort Shannon was briefly utilized during the American Civil War by Union troops as they occupied Palatka and patrolled the St. Johns River with gunboats. The building materials of Fort Shannon were pilferaged and eroded away in the 1880s, except for its Officer‚Äôs Quarters building. Hawes, Leland. A time of territorial clashes. The Tampa Tribune.

Arrested along with many other veterans of the Spanish Civil War on fabricated charges of being in an anti-Soviet conspiracy, he was eventually declared guilty of treason and shot without trial on orders of Lavrenty Beria in February 1942. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1954. Early life Ptukhin was born on 3 March 1902 to a Russian family in Yalta; at the time his father was a postal worker, but the family moved to Moscow in 1905 after he got a job as manager of a horse stable. While growing up in Moscow, Yevgeny gained some primary education before signing up for a technical school in Rozhdestvenka. However, he had to abandon his schooling in 1914 after his father's health deteriorated and his brother was drafted into the army, forcing him to begin working to take care of his family. He held a variety of jobs, including working as a porter for train stations, a newspaper deliveryman, and telephone operator, before he enlisted in the Red Army to pursue an aviation career. Initially rejected by the Red Army for being too young, he lied about his age, claiming to be two years older, to get accepted upon re-applying. Military career Initially Ptukhin worked as a mechanic in the 3rd Moscow Air Group, where he met and became friends with another future aviation general, Pyotr Pumpur. Not long after joining the Communist Party in 1918 he was deployed to combat zones of the Russian Civil War, where he repaired aircraft belonging to the 1st Aviation Artillery Squadron. After combat on the Polish front he continued to pursue attempts to gain admittance to pilot school, but he failed mathematics portion of entrance exams due to his minimal education. Not giving up on his dream of becoming a pilot, he began studying intensely in order to reach flight school. After relentlessly pursuing an aviation career by studying and working as a mechanic, he eventually was able to attend the Lipetsk flight school starting in December 1923. Shortly before the school was disbanded and all the cadets transferred to Borisoglebsk, he made his first flight on 4 April 1924, piloting an N-14. Soon Ptukhin graduated from the Borisoglebsk flight school among the group of the top 20 students and was sent to Serpukhov for further training before assignment to his squadron in late 1924; his old friend, Pyotr Pumpur, was assigned to the same squadron and the two were glad to reunite. In July 1925, the squadron was ordered to participate in the surpression of a Menshevik revolt; tasked with flying reconnaissance and firing missions, one pilot from the squadron (Senko) was shot down by the revolting Mensheviks on 11 July, but managed to run away from his plane before the rioters arrived. Just days earlier on 3 July the squadron had been named in honor of Feliks Derzhinsky, but in December 1926 it was redesignated as the 7th Separate Aviation Squadron and placed under the command of Aleksey Shirinkin. Ptukhin quickly rose through the ranks, being promoted to flight commander in 1926 and then to squadron commander in 1927. His command later decided to send him to the Air Force Academy for further training, and in 1929 he graduated from the advanced training courses for command personnel before being charged with command of the 15th Separate Fighter Aviation Squadron. After being appointed as commander and political commissar of the 450th Mixed Aviation Brigade in May 1934 he learned to pilot the R-5 to fly with the bombers in his unit, but he was more interested in fighter aircraft. After the brigade received the I-5 he intensified his flight training efforts, resulting in the brigade being noted for having a high proportion of flight hours and low number of accidents later than year. In July 1935 he was placed in command of the 142nd Aviation Brigade, and in November that year he was given the rank of kombrig. His brigade's activities intensified from 1935 to 1936 when the Belarussian Military District was scheduled to be checked for combat readiness by Voroshilov. Ptukhin put his brigade through intense training, having R-5 bombers fly with practice targets for the I-16 fighters to practice firing accuracy. Having demonstrated combat readiness, he attended a meeting with several other unit commanders, where he got into an argument with the commander of the 4th cavalry division about how and when aviation should be used in combat. On 15 May 1937 Ptukhin was assigned to join the group of Soviet military advisors to the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. Working under the pseudonym General Jos√©, Ptukhin fighters flying for the Spanish Republican Air Force. After a night bombing in July left him with a shrapnel wound in the leg he refused to go to the hospital and insisted on continuing military duties. Despite the Soviet I-15 and I-16 fighters they were equipped with having a disadvantage against the newer German-made fighters that the nationalists used, the aviation group under Ptukhin's command still managed to gain some aerial victories in Spain, resulting in him being the Order of Lenin on 22 December. Not long after returning to the Soviet Union he was promoted to the rank komkor on 22 February 1938. As a newly promoted komkor, Ptukhin was made commander of the air force of the Leningrad Military District. In that capacity he spend a lot of time in the I-16 fighter, instructing pilots how to fly it in addition to piloting the plane in the May Day parade. However, he was soon recalled to attend training for commanders at the Academy of General Staff in Moscow. Upon graduating in February 1939 he returned to his previous post. Before the start of the Winter War he had a conversation with Stalin about using airfields in Estonia in the event of a conflict with Finland. Immediately after the start of the war with Finland Stalin issued orders down the chain of command for the construction of an airbase on Dago Island, which was completely forested. Word eventually reached Ptukhin, and before the end of the year the airfield was constructed. In January 1940 he was made commander of the newly formed air force Northwestern Front, which consisted of various bomber, fighter, and reconnaissance aviation units. The over 500 aircraft under his command participated heavily in the attack on the Mannerheim Line of the Karelian isthmus, which often involved pilots making multiple sorties per day. Shortly after the end of the conflict he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 21 March 1940, and on 4 June 1940 he was promoted to the rank of general-lieutenant. On 28 January 1941 Ptukhin was promoted to head of the Main Directorate of Air Defense, but due to the stresses of the job he switched to commander of the Air Force of the Kiev Military District in the spring. In that position he became concerned about the frequency of German aircraft entering Soviet airspace on reconnaissance flights and expressed a strong desire to shoot them down. Gravely concerned about the military threat posed by a potential German invasion, he ordered ground camouflage to be used on airfields and shelters to be constructed to protect aircraft in the event of enemy bombardments, but not all the shelters were completed in time to prevent aviation in the district from being decimated in Operation Barbarossa. Downfall Ptukhin was removed from his post and arrested in late June 1941 after the airfields under his command sustained heavy losses in the wake of Operation Barbarossa. He was sent to Butyrskaya prison several days later and charged with participation in an anti-Soviet conspiracy based on the coerced testimonies of other high-ranking military officials arrested on orders of Beria in the purge of the Red Army and Air Force, including Yakov Smushkevich, Sergey Chernobrovkin, and Pavel Yusupov. Forced testimonies from other people arrested alleged that Ptukhin was active in an anti-Soviet conspiracy since 1935 and recruited by Ieronim Uborevich. After he was shot on orders of Beria on 23 February 1942 and buried in an unknown location, he was officially stripped of his military awards by decree of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 15 May 1943. Over a decade later he was posthumously rehabilitated on 6 October 1954 due to the lack of corpus delicti and on 22 May 1965 his military awards were restored.

Several students from Hukarere Girls College were photographed as models for the statue, and eventually, Mei Irihapiti Robin (now Mei Whaitiri, the mother of local MP Meka Whaitiri), was selected. A traditional piupiu skirt, and the photographs of Mei, were sent to the Italian marble company of Carrara in Carrara, Italy and used to create a clay model. This clay model was then used to produce the bronze statue, which is estimated to weigh between 60 and 70 kg. The statue was unveiled on 10 June 1954 by then Prime Minister Sidney Holland.

Early life  Calvin Lightner was born in 1877 in Winnsboro, South Carolina, United States, to Frank and Daphney Lightner, a carpenter and homemaker. He moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1898 and enrolled at Shaw University, graduating in 1908.  Career  Lightner Arcade and Hotel In 1907 Lightner designed and built his own home in Raleigh, despite not having any formal education in construction. Following his graduation from college, Lightner worked as a mortician's apprentice before establishing his own funeral home‚Äîthe first such business for black people in Raleigh‚Äîdespite not having an official charter to do so. In 1909 he erected the Lightner Building on East Hargett Street in Raleigh, thus creating the second black- owned building on the street after the Odd Fellows Building. In 1911 he received a state charter to set up a funeral business and founded the Lightner Funeral Home on October 1, operating it out of the first floor of the Lightner Building. He subsequently oversaw the construction of many business of East Hargett Street, and thus sparked a shift in the concentration of Raleigh's black-owned businesses from Wilmington Street to East Hargett, which became known as the city's \\"Black Main Street.\\" Lightner was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In 1919 he and two other black men, Laurence Cheek and Manassa Thomas Pope ran for municipal offices in Raleigh; Lightner sought the post of Commissioner of Public Works. Jim Crow restrictions prevented most black men from voting and all three lost their elections. Lightner earned 142 votes, the most of any of the black candidates. Reflecting on the campaign, he said \\"Even if we had won we knew the whites wouldn't let us administer. But we just wanted to wake our people up politically.\\" The campaign garnered the support of many blacks and provoked the ire of some white leaders, who as a result discouraged other white people from supporting black enterprises. In 1921 Lightner built the Lightner Arcade and Hotel across the street from the Lightner Building, later joking that he decided to erect it after his wife had complained that he hosted too many friends from out of town at their home. The arcade quickly became a center of social activity for Raleigh's black community, and was considered one of the best hotels for black clientele along the East Coast of the United States. During its existence it was the only hotel in Raleigh that would accept black customers and hosted musicians Cab Calloway, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington. The building also housed a restaurant, drug store, barbershop, and the offices of The Carolinian. Lightner also heavily remodeled Davie Street Presbyterian Church in 1922, where he became a parishioner, and designed the Mechanics and Farmers Bank Building in Durham. Following the Great Depression, Lightner sold his hotel. In 1941 he purchased the Capehart House and moved his funeral home there. In 1959 he gave control of his funeral home to his son, Clarence.  Later life  Lightner died on May 21, 1960 at St. Agnes Hospital in Raleigh. A funeral was held for him on May 25 at Davie Street Presbyterian Church, and he was buried in Mt. Hope Cemetery. The Lightner Arcade burned down in 1968. Lightner's son, Clarence, was elected Mayor of Raleigh in 1973.

Construction  Everalda was built at the William Gray & Co. Ltd. shipyard in Hartlepool, United Kingdom in 1912. Where she was launched and completed that same year. The ship was long, had a beam of and had a depth of . She was assessed at and had 1 x 3 cyl. triple expansion engine driving a screw propeller. The ship could reach a maximum speed of 8 knots and could generate 312 n.h.p. thanks to her 2 single boilers and 6 corrugated furnaces.  Sinking  Everalda was travelling from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, carrying general cargo with a stopover at Cape Henry. At 17:45 pm on 29 June 1942, Everalda was attacked and shelled by the German submarine U-158 on her starboard beam. U-158 also attacked the bridge with machine gun fire and destroyed the ship's transmitter, so no distress signals could be sent from Everalda. Six incendiary rounds were fired from U-158's deck gun, which started small fires in hold #1 and blew away the hatches of hold #2 on board the Everalda. The chief engineer immediately stopped the engines while U-158 ceased fire for ten minutes so the crew could abandon ship in their two lifeboats. After the evacuation, nine more rounds were fired at Everalda, hitting her amidships below the waterline on her port side. At 18:10 pm U-158 ran out of shells, yet Everalda showed no signs of sinking. So a boarding party was organised to open the bottom valves of the ship, finally sinking her by the bow at 20:00 pm. The U-boat crew captured secret codes, confidential papers, routing instructions and other important documents like a letter for the consul at Rio de Janeiro. They also took the ship's captain and the Spanish crew member Bernardo Cores Cardama as prisoners of war on board of U-158. The remaining 34 survivors were evenly distributed between the two lifeboats, which then set sail to the northwest and were soon separated. In the afternoon of 4 July 1942, both lifeboats were spotted by a US Army bomber on an anti-submarine patrol. The bomber couldn't retrieve the survivors, but instead dropped provisions for one of the two lifeboats which was located about east of Cape Hatteras. Shortly thereafter the USN blimp K-7 arrived and directed the patrol boat USCGC CG-466 to their position. The survivors were picked up and taken to Ocracoke, North Carolina. Two hours later, the same flying boat again dropped provisions for the remaining lifeboat and directed the patrol yacht USS Tourmaline (PY 20) to their position to pick them up as well. They were rescued and taken to Morehead City on 5 July 1942. U-158 was sunk by two depth charges from a PBM-3C Mariner flying boat on 30 June 1942, one day after the sinking of Everalda, which killed all on board, including the two imprisoned crew members of Everalda.

Deadline Hollywood, April 9, 2020.

Le Journal de Montr√©al, May 13, 2019. the film stars Josh Hartnett as Canadian investigative journalist Victor Malarek, investigating the arrest of drug addict Daniel L√©ger (Antoine Olivier Pilon). The film's cast also includes Jim Gaffigan, Stephen McHattie, Don McKellar, J.C. MacKenzie, and Amanda Crew. The film was theatrically released in Canada on July 10, 2020,Chris Knight, \\"Target Number One is a rough-and- ready feature length Heritage Minute\\". National Post, July 10, 2020. and on video on demand services in the United States on July 24, 2020.  Plot  In 1989, Victor Malarek (Josh Hartnett) a Canadian journalist investigates the circumstances surrounding the suspicious arrest of Daniel Leger (Antoine Olivier Pilon), a 25-year-old heroin addict serving time in a prison in Thailand and facing the death penalty. Malarek is a dedicated investigative journalist working for The Globe and Mail newspaper who is being pressured by his boss to move to writing weekly feature articles. He comes across the strange case of a Canadian citizen under arrest in Thailand after a joint investigation by Canadian and Thai authorities. Leger is identified as a mastermind in the drug trafficking trade. Malarek's interest is pricked when he queries a few details with the Canadian authorities and receives push back. He decides to dig deeper and uncovers some worrying items about the case. He brings the case to his editor Art (J. C. MacKenzie) with a view to doing a piece. Art reluctantly agrees to let Malarek visit Thailand and interview the Thai authorities and Leger. The film then splits and introduces Daniel Leger, who is shown to be little more than a drug addict, who naively took a job with a dealer, Glen Picker (Jim Gaffigan). Picker befriends the naive Leger and offers to let him stay and work for him, all the while intending to set up Leger for a pay-off from the Canadian police narcotics division. He identifies Leger as a major player in the Thai drug world, and indicates that Leger can organise for a major shipment of heroin to be smuggled to Canada. The narcotics police in need of a major morale boosting drugs seizure fall for Picker's scam. The lead detective, Frank Cooper (Stephen McHattie) makes an error in reviewing Leger and mistakes him for another criminal with a detailed criminal history. Picker manipulates Leger into meeting with detective Cooper under the guise of a favour and naively believes Cooper to be a drug smuggler. The narcotics operation hits a snag when it's uncovered that Leger is nervous to travel to Thailand, and he has had his passport withheld. The Canadian police organise for Leger's passport to be issued, pay for the young man's flights, hotels and expenses in Thailand. Leger left with no other options, travels to Thailand and tries to organise for a drug buy, but can only find a Tuk Tuk driver who can get 2 kgs of heroin. The Canadian police agree to the deal but the deal goes awry. Leger turns up with Cooper who is undercover and the suppliers arrive separately. There is a struggle, and in the chaos that ensues Detective Cooper shoots his son Al Cooper (Cory Lipman) fatally. The drug suppliers are arrested, alongside Leger and taken to a Thai prison. Malarek meets and interviews Leger and uncovers the above details. Upon leaving the prison he shouts to Leger to plead guilty as he will likely be found guilty and given the death penalty otherwise. At the trial, Leger is unable to understand the proceedings. Detective Cooper testifies falsely that Leger is a hardened criminal with a long list of convictions in Canada. Leger pleads his innocence but once he has been found guilty he alters his plea to guilty and receives a 100 year sentence. In Canada, Malarek is feeling pressure for proceeding with the investigation. He loses his job at The Globe and Mail and TV and his wife leaves him due to the pressure they are under. A last ray of hope is offered when Malarek's article is read by the newly formed ethics investigation department. They review Leger's case and petition Leger to respond. The film concludes with Leger's transfer from a Thailand prison to a Canadian prison. The young man kicks his addiction in the Thai prison. He then educates himself in the Thai judicial system and after serving 8 years manages to get a prison transfer. Malarek meets him at the airport, where it is revealed that both of Leger's parents have passed but it is shown that Leger has a new positive outlook on life. The film concludes with a note that Cooper and his fellow officers all received commendations for their actions. The investigation into their handling of the Leger case was watered down and led to the lead investigator retiring. Malarek moves to the politics beat to save his marriage but shortly returns to his passion of investigative journalism.

However, he had difficulty attracting enough funding to make the film; although he took payment for the screenplay, he reinvested his directorial salary, as did the film's producers, into the film to keep it under its $7 million budget.Alex Rose, \\"Target Number One is an ambitious political thriller\\".

Chris Knight of the National Post rated the film three stars out of five, writing that \\"The story, mostly devoid of car chases and gunfire except in one key scene, may strike some as a little dour, a touch too Canadian, and Target Number Ones fate outside our borders remains to be seen.

Then, he enrolled at the Budapest Technical College where he studied architecture. From 1859 he opened his own architectural firm, and in the period from 1869 until 1890, he was employed by the Serbian Ministry of Construction and Public Works in Belgrade as a state architect. He worked in the countries of Austria-Hungary and in Serbia. He designed and erected the largest number of buildings in Belgrade: the initial design of the National Theatre 1869-1870,the Old Palace 1881-1884, now the seat of the Assembly of the City of Belgrade, some 126 public and private buildings, then Dom dru≈°tva Crvenog krsta (the House of the Red Cross), the Delini pharmacy on Zeleni venac, the building of the former Ministry of Education, today's House of Vuk's Foundation.

The concept revolves around reversing the race of characters being played (white characters being played by black actors and vice versa). The concept was intended as a way to open up non-traditional character roles to more actors but has received complaints that it waters down racial differences.  History  The concept of race-reversed casting was invented by the British actor Sir Patrick Stewart in 1997. As a classically trained Shakespearean actor, Stewart had wanted to play the titular character in Othello but stated that when he got to the point in his career where he felt he was experienced enough to play it, it had become no longer socially acceptable for white actors to put on blackface to play the role. Stewart stated \\"one day, thinking about the play, a notion occurred to me, what if we keep the racial element of the play but we just switch it over\\" and came up with a concept which would later be called \\"photo negative\\" casting. This technique involved reversing the skin colour of the characters, so that the majority of the characters would be black, while Othello, Bianca, Montano and the servants would be white; thus he would be able to play Othello. This was also done with the intention of continuing to broaden a view of racial prejudice, as the original lines and racial language in the script were not changed from the source material. Stewart, when playing Othello, said he always paused after he said the line \\"Happily, for I am black\\" because he felt if anyone was going to voice an objection to the photo negative concept, that would be the place they would do it. Some reviewers claimed that some non- regular theatre-goers \\"snickered\\" when that line was said. The concept would be later picked up by Shakespeare's Globe Theatre Company, who would put on a performance of Antony and Cleopatra using race-reversed casting in 1999. Race- reversed casting occurred again in 2014 for a performance of Death of a Salesman in Philadelphia, United States.  Reaction  The concept was controversial as the National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company in the United Kingdom rejected Stewart's concept, believing it was too sensitive. In the United States, only the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. would take up the concept after Stewart told the theatre director \\"I want to be in a racially reversed Othello\\". Two black actors originally cast in Othello almost walked out, as they felt the race-reversed casting offensive, but the director Jude Kelly convinced them to remain. Theatre critics felt that race-reversed casting resulted in a neutralisation of the play's racial themes. However, the concept has been praised for allowing actors to play characters that would have otherwise been unavailable to them. It has also been praised for focusing on the social dynamics of how minorities can be isolated by whoever is in the majority. Others cite it as an example to demonstrate how adaptable Shakespeare is in interpretation.

He was the author of a major but incomplete multi-volume work on the birds of Denmark published from 1925 to 1931. Schi√∏ler was born in Frederiksberg where he became interested in birds as a schoolboy in Herlufsholm under the influence of his teacher Margar Traustedt. He then went to the Metropolitan School and during this period began to collect eggs and bird skins. His collections became so large, with 21,000 skins, 2,000 mounted specimens, and 10,000 skeletons, that he needed a house next to his villa in Uraniavej in Copenhagen. He studied at the Brockske Business School and also went to train in banking in the United States. In 1906 he became a partner in his father's company. In 1925 he went on an expedition to Greenland along with the artist Johannes Larsen and ornithologist Finn Salomonsen. He was one of the founding members of the Danish Ornithological Association, serving as its first chairman. The 1922 financial crash led to the family company being liquidated and much of the family fortunes were lost. He started working on a major work on the birds of Denmark, Danmarks Fugle, but he was able to publish only three of a projected eight volumes, after being paralyzed in 1926. He helped organized the International Ornithological Congress held in Copengahen in 1926. The third volume was published after his death in 1929. The paintings of birds were made by Johannes Larsen, Gerhard Heilmann, and Henning Scheel and the work has been considered a landmark in bird art. Schi√∏ler was also a member of the Danish hunting organization and was very keen on the protection of birds of prey and contributed to changes in the hunting laws of 1922.

Published in the Official Journal of the European Union no. L 283, 51 on 31 October 2003. is a European directive, which establishes the framework conditions of the European Union for the taxation of electricity, motor and aviation fuels and most heating fuels. The directive is part of European Union energy law; its core component is the setting of minimum tax rates for all Member States.  Purpose and scope  The directive is intended to ensure the functionality of the EU internal energy market and to avoid distortions of competition through different tax systems. In addition, it should also contribute to a low-carbon, energy-efficient economy, that is, to exert a steering effect with the aim of protecting the environment and the climate. For this purpose, it sets EU-wide minimum tax amounts for electricity and for fuels when they are used as motor fuel, aviation fuel or heating fuel. The minimum tax amounts vary according to the type of fuel (petrol, kerosene, gas oil, liquid and natural gas) and their use. When used as a heating fuel or when used in, for example, stationary engines, agriculture or construction machinery for public works, lower minimum amounts apply than when used as motor fuel. The Member States have extensive freedom in the design of taxes, the directive only requires that the indirect taxes reach the minimum amounts without value-added tax (VAT). There are a number of exceptions to the directive: * Lower taxes are permitted for commercial diesel. * Tax exemptions and reductions may be granted for environmental and health reasons. * Tax exemptions are possible for renewable energy sources and electricity for public transport. * Tax reductions are possible for energy-intensive businesses. * Some energy-intensive sectors, such as the metal industry, as well as substances that can be used for various purposes, for example for both heating and the production of chemical substances, are exempt from the directive. * There are also a number of special and transitional rules for many Member States. Member States are advised to largely exempt commercial aviation and commercial shipping in the European Community's marine waters (referred to as 'air navigation and sea navigation'), but Member States are allowed to limit these exemptions (Preamble ¬ß23). For example, Member States may levy taxes on kerosene (jet fuel) below the minimum rate for domestic flights and flights between Member States that have concluded a separate bilateral agreement (Article 14(1)(b) and (2)).  Development  The directive replaced Directive 92/81/EECCouncil Directive 92/81/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonization of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils and Directive 92/82/EECCouncil Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils ‚Äì which only harmonised mineral oil taxes ‚Äì after ten years of negotiations.Erw√§gungsgrund (1) der 2003/96/EG. European primary law,Primary law is the supreme source of law in the European Union, deriving from seven categories: founding treaties, amending treaties, accession treaties, protocols annexed to those treaties, supplementary agreements amending specific sections of the founding treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (since the Treaty of Lisbon), and general principles established by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). which is the legal basis for the directive,Article 113 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (former Article 93 TEC). requires a unanimous decision of the European Council for tax law requirements. Unanimous decisions are also required for changes to the directive. When they were introduced in 2004, the tax rates in most countries were above the minimum tax amounts. In 2008, the Council asked the Commission to come up with proposals on how to better align the Directive with the energy and climate targets of the European Union. The Commission concluded in 2011 that the directive was unsustainable and that it provided the wrong incentives., Format: PDF, KBytes: 63 It proposed an amendment that would have set the minimum rates based on energy content and CO2 emissions. However, the proposal met with opposition from Luxembourg, Poland and, according to internal voices, Germany as well. In 2015 the Commission removed the proposal from its work programme. According to the March 2020 feedback report of Transport and Environment, 'the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) has not been reviewed since 2003, and needs updating if the European Commission is serious about deploying its European Green Deal.'

He then enrolled at Rice in the fall of 1954. Due to NCAA player eligibility rules of the time, Tucker could not play varsity basketball until his sophomore year in 1955‚Äì56. He made an immediate impact that season, which saw him average 22.1 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. The 22.7 scoring average was the second best in school history to that point, while his 12.7 rebounds led the Southwest Conference (SWC) for the season. In just his first eligible season, Tucker earned a third-team All- American selection by a major All-American voting body of the time (NEA). He was also named to the All-SWC second team. Despite his drop in production, Tucker's junior season in 1956‚Äì57 saw him repeat in leading Rice in points (15.1) and rebounds (10.5) per game. He earned his second consecutive All-SWC second team honor. During his senior season, Tucker averaged 13.5 points and 8.8 rebounds and was awarded the Billy Wohn Award as the team's most valuable player. For his career, Tucker scored 1,218 points (including a then school single-game record of 43) and grabbed 768 rebounds (then-second in school history behind Gene Schwinger's 810).

Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. This climate supports an un-named glacier on its east side. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for viewing and climbing are July through September. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

It was created by the senior designer of Titanfall 2, Jake Keating, who was inspired to implement the time travel mechanic in part after watching the History Channel series, Life After People. The level was originally planned to be used for the first Titanfall, but the designers did not have the time to implement it. The level uses two maps to represent both time periods. These maps are perfectly aligned with one another, as any misalignment would make the mechanic not function properly. It was the most labor and time-intensive level in the game, going through several revisions in order to make it play well and not confuse players, while still trying to avoid guiding them too much. Environmental art director Todd Sue found the design Keating presented to be an artistic mess, though was able to work with it and commended Keating on his game design skills. The level received praise for being particularly good at being a first-person shooter stage as well as for being a good level in general. It received particular praise for its use of time travel as a gameplay mechanic. Eurogamer discussed how it defied its shooter genre, comparing its gameplay and storytelling to Super Mario 3D World and 30 Flights of Loving, respectively, while Game Informer meanwhile praised it for its use of classic gameplay to convey something new. Summary \\"Effect and Cause\\" is a level in the video game Titanfall 2. The protagonists of the game, Jack Cooper and BT-7274, arrive at the ARES Division, which was destroyed and abandoned, while planning to meet up with a man named Major Eli Anderson. The two split up to search for Anderson, and during this period, Jack experiences anomalies, where he is sent to a time when the ARES Division was not damaged or abandoned. Jack discovers the coordinates of Anderson, who he discovers is stuck in the ceiling, dead. When Jack takes Anderson's helmet, he is declared the acting- commanding-officer of Militia forces on the planet Typhon, where the level takes place, by BT. Jack also eventually gains the ability to transport between the past and the present, doing combat with soldiers in the past, and malfunctioning robots and wildlife in the present. The ARES Division has different areas, including a nanotechnology lab and a cryogenic prison. After collecting six pilot helmets containing data, Jack is engaged by multiple enemies in the past, and returns to the present to reunite with BT. The two of them work together to get towards a weapon and scan it during an explosion that is locked in time. Concept and creation \\"Effect and Cause\\" was created by senior designer of Titanfall 2, Jake Keating. The idea for a time travel mechanic and level came from Keating leaving Infinity Ward after a dispute with Activision, where he would then be employed by Respawn Entertainment. At this time, Keating had more creative freedom, focusing on science fiction ideas after working exclusively on Call of Duty for a long time. He was inspired to implement the idea of shifting times by the History Channel series, Life After People, which depicts what the world would look like if humanity suddenly disappeared and would swap between the present and future. He was drawn to this contrast, and pitched the idea of players entering a facility after a space-time accident, using a time travel device to save a scientist. The premise was originally intended to be used for the game's predecessor, but a lack of time lead to them not being able to implement a single-player campaign until its sequel. When development of Titanfall 2 began, Keating used a multi-player map from the first game to create a mock-up of what the level would look like, and created a time swapping mechanic. This level was the most labor- and time-intensive one in the game. As a result, Keating had to work extra hard to convince his co- workers of its potential. The level went through two major revisions during development. When designing the map, Keating and other staff put the past and present areas stacked on top of one another, and the process caused some difficulties, with playtesting finding players warped out of bounds. When players utilize the time travel mechanic, Keating had to make sure that the maps were perfectly vertically aligned so that they would appear in the exact same location between the two maps. The level went through focus testing, with Keating feeling stressed about testers being too confused by this level for years, with his anxiety making him want to \\"handhold\\" the players, though he resisted this. Initially, players were meant to go alone to the location of \\"Effect and Cause,\\" with BT having sacrificed his life to save Jack, but this was scrapped after the story began developing further. The level remained \\"in flux\\" during development for a long time due to Keating making both big and small changes, which he felt would bother sound and art designers, but avoid them having to scrap their work if any changes required they do so. Keating originally intended to have a mall setting, envisioning the overall campus as much larger than it was in the end. The mall setting was later changed to be a cryogenic prison. He cited this as an example of a level designer giving the art designer \\"incomprehensible\\" level geometry, praising the art designers for their work. Environmental art director Todd Sue discussed how the concept Keating gave was an \\"atrocity to art,\\" noting that Keating is known for this kind of thing, though he praises his game design work overall. In an earlier version of the level, enemies would continue to move when players were in a different time period. This was later changed in order to make it more entertaining. Reception Gamasutra writer Bryant Francis called it an \\"interesting sample\\" of Titanfall 2s strengths. They suggested that designers could learn a lot from this level while making their own. Mic writer Alex Perry found it mindblowing in a way first-person shooters usually are not. Push Square writer Liam Croft identified it as one of the best levels in a first-person shooter of its generation. RPG Site writer Josh Torres praised the level as an \\"impressive technical feat on a structural level and a gameplay level.\\" PCGamesN writer Matt Purslow felt that \\"Effect and Cause\\" is what demonstrated Respawn's \\"understanding of what makes their game unique.\\" On December 15, 2016, GamesRadar+ writer Leon Hurley recommended the level as something players should experience before the year ends. They discussed how this level would give players \\"disbelief\\" when they realize how extensive the level's hook is. They felt that it was one of the best video game levels of all time, a sentiment that The Telegraph staff shared. Vice writers Patrick Klepek and Sayem Ahmed both regarded it as a highlight of Titanfall 2, with the former wishing that he had more time to utilize the time travel mechanic. GameSpot writer Robert Handlery called it the most memorable part of the game. Game Informer writer Brian Shea felt that it was among the best-designed levels in a video game. Fellow Game Informer writer Javy Gwaltney talked about how \\"Effect and Cause\\" demonstrates a \\"subtle kind of ambition\\"; as opposed to other games which may focus on the size of the world or number of the quests, Gwaltney argues that the designers used classic game design to make something \\"bold and exhilarating.\\" PC Gamer Tom Senior called it one of the best levels of 2016, stating that its ideas are \\"brilliant\\" and \\"flawlessly executed.\\" Fellow PC Gamer writer Chris Thurston called it a \\"standout\\" level, staying that it would not be \\"out of place\\" in the first-person shooter series Half- Life. USgamer Doc Burford disputed the notion that \\"Effect and Cause\\" was the best level in Titanfall 2, instead giving that title to The Beacon. They praised \\"Effect and Cause\\" as a great and \\"clever\\" level, though argued that \\"Effect and Cause\\" is \\"cerebral,\\" whereas The Beacon focuses on \\"heart.\\" Eurogamer writer Christian Donlan suggested that it would be \\"heavily quoted\\" for years, and discussed how its gameplay defies genre; while it is a shooter, Donlan felt similarities between it and the platform game Super Mario 3D World and the cinematic story game 30 Flights of Loving.

The hamlet, which was pro-government and defended by US Marines and South Vietnamese militia, was attacked by the VC in the early morning of 11 June. Under cover of a mortar barrage VC sappers set fire to houses and killed civilians either by shooting to throwing explosives into their shelters. The Marines and South Vietnamese forces engaged with the VC and called in artillery support. By 03:15 the VC began to withdraw and the Marines reoccupied the village and began evacuating the wounded. In all 156 houses were destroyed and 35 damaged during the attack. Four militiamen were killed and two wounded, ten U.S. Marines were wounded. Civilian casualties were 74 dead, many of them women and children; 60 severely injured; and over 100 lightly wounded. Four VC dead were found, one prisoner was taken and one of the VC defected. The VC later claimed that they had been attempting to capture the bridge in the village and that the civilians had merely been caught in the crossfire. Background Phu Thanh village, a complex of several hamlets, straddled Highway 1 about north of Landing Zone Baldy. Just to the north of the village, the Highway crossed the Ba Ren Bridge, one of the vital links on the land lines of communication between LZ Baldy and Da Nang. Phu Thanh was a pro South Vietnamese government village and contained the homes of many Regional Force (RF) and Popular Force (PF) soldiers and government officials, and its people were a reliable source of information about the VC in their area. Because of its proximity to the bridge, Phu Thanh had strong security forces in and around it. CUPP Team 9, a squad from the 1st Platoon of Company A, 7th Marines, was stationed in the village with PF Platoons 144 and 171. Phu Thanh also contained a 22-man Revolutionary Development team and a People's Self-Defense Force unit of 31 members, eight of whom had weapons. Near the south end of the bridge lay the compound of the 323rd RF Company, which had as its main mission protection of the span. The command post of the 1st Platoon of Company A, which controlled several CUPPs along the highway north of LZ Baldy, was located near the RF compound. For several weeks, rumors had circulated in the village that the VC were planning to attack the Ba Ren Bridge, but neither Marines nor Vietnamese saw any reason to expect an assault on the hamlets themselves. On the night of 10-11 June, the CUPP unit had taken up a night position within the village. The RF troops, following their usual practice, remained in their fortified compound watching the bridge. Attack and massacre At 02:00 on 11 June, the VC, later identified as elements of the V-25th Main Force Battalion and the T-89th Sapper Battalion, launched a coordinated attack. It began with a barrage of 60mm and 82mm mortar fire. The mortars, located north and south of Phu Thanh, dropped a total of 200-250 high explosive and white phosphorus rounds on the village. They concentrated on CUPP 9, the bridge, the 1st Platoon CP and the RF compound. Simultaneous with this barrage, the VC attacked two other CUPP teams in hamlets south of Phu Thanh on Highway 1, engaging them with small arms, rocket-propelled grenades, grenades, and mortars and preventing them from maneuvering to reinforce Phu Thanh. Under cover of the mortar fire, two groups of sappers entered the village, one from the east and one from the west. Armed with grenades and satchel charges, a few rushed the RF compound and the 1st Platoon command post and were cut down by the defenders' fire. Most began burning houses and hurling their grenades and satchel charges into family bomb shelters filled with civilians who had fled to them for protection from the shelling. A Marine recalled: \\"The enemy ran through the village, ordering people out of their bunkers. When they did [come out], they were shot, or else [the enemy threw] chicoms [grenades] into the bunker, killing the men, women, and children in them‚Ä¶ Very many civilians [were] killed just inside their bunkers, if it wasn't from shrapnel wounds it was from fire where they were burned to death from the satchel charges used.\\" The defenders fought back as best they could, but the continuous mortar barrage prevented them from counterattacking to save the village. At the bridge, the RF company beat back a minor probe of its compound. CUPP 9 had 10 Marines wounded in the initial shelling, nevertheless, the Marines and PFs managed to form a perimeter in the blazing village and hold their position. When it became evident that the enemy were concentrating their attack on the civilians and bypassing the CUPP, the PF commander let most of his men go home to try to protect their families, but he himself stayed with the Marines, as did the PF radioman and mortar team. At the 1st Platoon command post, Marines and PFs repelled a rush by a few of the sappers and answered the mortar barrage with their own 81mm and 60mm mortars. The platoon commander kept the 7th Marines Headquarters informed by radio of the progress of the battle and called for artillery and air support. The first rounds of friendly artillery began falling on suspected VC positions 20 minutes after the attack started. At about 03:15, the VC mortar fire temporarily slackened as the sappers began to withdraw from the village. The Marines took advantage of the lull to send a squad into Phu Thanh to find and assist CUPP 9. To reach the CUPP, the squad had to work its way through a part of the village already devastated by the sappers. The squad reached the CUPP team and in two trips brought the wounded Marines and PFs to the bridge to be picked up by helicopters. Then, accompanied by the platoon's Vietnamese interpreter, the squad returned to the burning hamlets and began urging the people to bring their wounded to the bridge. By this time, the VC mortars had resumed firing slowly to cover the retreat of the sappers. The first medical evacuation helicopter from Marine Aircraft Group 16 landed on the bridge around 03:30 and lifted out all the Marine, PF and RF wounded in the attack. Thereafter, a steady stream of helicopters came in, covered by two Cobra gunships, to evacuate the civilian wounded. The mortar bombardment ended at about 04:00 and by daylight all the severely wounded civilians had been evacuated and a team of doctors and corpsmen from LZ Baldy had reached Phu Thanh and had begun treating the minor casualties, over 100 in all. Aftermath The 7th Marines commander arrived at 08:10 to assess the damage, followed at 10:20 by 1st Marine Division commander Major General Charles F. Widdecke. Within hours, the 1st Marine Division and the province government had emergency relief and reconstruction under way. The VC had destroyed 156 houses and damaged 35 more, most of them in Thanh My, the hardest hit of the village's hamlets. The attack had cost the Marines ten wounded, one of whom later died. Four RF and two PF soldiers had been wounded. Civilian casualties totalled 74 dead, many of them women and children; 60 severely injured; and over 100 lightly wounded. After the fight, the defenders found four dead VC in the wire around the RF compound and the 1st Platoon command post and they captured one prisoner and one Chieu Hoi. Soon after the attack, the VC began spreading the report that their objective really had been the Ba Ren Bridge and that Phu Thanh and its people merely had been caught in the crossfire. The Marines countered that the VC had deliberately attacked the village. A Marine Lieutenant stated: \\"There was no military objective involved in this attack. I say this because first of all there was only light enemy contact directly at the compound. The mortars were fired in such a manner as to restrain any military contact . The VC stayed pretty much out of the area CUPP 9 was operating in. Also, the Ba Ren Bridge, which is a major line of communications on Route 1 was not hit; there was not even an attempt to blow this bridge up.\\" On 15 June the South Vietnamese Government issued a note to the International Control and Supervision Commission protesting the massacre and asking it to undertake an investigation. William Broyles has written that the communists' massacre of civilians at Hu·∫ø and Thanh My is inconvenient and so have been \\"airbrushed\\" out of Vietnamese history.

Life Peterkin was born in Macduff in Banffshire, where his father, William Peterkin, was parish minister. His father was translated to Leadhills, Lanarkshire, in 1785, and in 1787 to Ecclesmachan, West Lothian, where he died in 1792. Alexander's education, begun at the parish school, was completed in Edinburgh, and he closed his university curriculum as a law student in 1803. In this year he was enrolled in the first regiment of Royal Edinburgh volunteers, feeling with Walter Scott and others that the time needed a strong civilian army. After a full training in the office of a Writer to the Signet, Peterkin was duly qualified as a solicitor before the supreme courts (S. S. C.), and he began his professional career at Peterhead before 1811 as \\"attorney, notary public, and conveyancer\\". He was sheriff-substitute of Orkney from 1814 to 1823, when he returned to Edinburgh. For some years he combined journalism with his legal work; he was connected with newspapers in Belfast and Perth, and from 1833 to 1835 he was editor of the Kelso Chronicle. In his later years he was known as a leading ecclesiastical lawyer, while still devoting his leisure to literary work. He died at Edinburgh on 9 November 1846. A lover of literature for its own sake, Peterkin numbered among his friends Walter Scott, Alexander Jeffrey, John Wilson, and the leading contemporary men of letters in Edinburgh. Thomas Wilson Bayne wrote in the Dictionary of National Biography: \\"A 'whig of 1688', Peterkin was a strenuous and unsparing controversialist.... He was a vigorous and lucid writer, his earlier manner being somewhat florid, and his polemical thrusts occasionally more forcible than polite. His writings on Orkney and Shetland may be consulted with advantage, and his learned and systematic Booke of the Universall Kirk has a distinctly authoritative value.\\" Peterkin married in 1807 Miss Giles, daughter of an Edinburgh citizen, with whom he had two sons and five daughters. The elder son, Alexander Peterkin (1814‚Äì1889), was successively editor of the Berwick Advertiser, sub-editor of the Edinburgh Advertiser, and on the staff of the London Times, from which he retired about 1853, owing to uncertain health. He published a poem, The Study of Art, 1870. Publications Besides numerous pamphlets, miscellaneous papers in many periodicals, and an anonymous tale of Scottish life, The Parsonage, or my Father's Fireside, Peterkin published: # The Rentals of Orkney, 1820. # Notes on Orkney and Zetland, 1822. # Letter to the Landowners, Clergy, and other Gentlemen of Orkney and Zetland, 1823. # Scottish Peerage, 1826. # Compendium of the Laws of the Church, pt. i. 1830, pt. ii. 1831, supplement 1836. # Memoir of the Rev. John Johnston, Edinburgh, 1834. # The Booke of the Universall Kirk of Scotland, 1839. # The Constitution of the Church of Scotland as established at the Revolution, 1689‚Äì90, 1841. All were published at Edinburgh. Peterkin also edited James Grahame's The Sabbath, with biography, 1807; Robert Fergusson's Poems, with biography, 1807‚Äì9, reprinted 1810; James Currie's Life of Burns, with prefatory critical review, 1815; and Records of the Kirk of Scotland, 1838.

The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Veerateswarar and his consort is known as Gnanambigai. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 276 temples that find mention in it. As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have punished Kama, the cupid. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and few yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty during the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam. Legend Legend of Shiva turning Kamadeva into ashes for disturbing his sacrifice As per Hindu legend, Kamadeva, the cupid, was married to Ratƒ´. One of the principal myths regarding Kama is that of his incineration by Shiva, the Kama Dahana. It occurs in its most developed form in the Matsya Purana (verses 227-255) but is also repeated with variants in the Shaiva Purana and other Puranas.Klaus Klostermaier, (2000) Hinduism: A Short History. Oxford: One World Publications. Indra and the gods were suffering at the hands of the demon Tarakasura. Tarakasura obtained superior powers from Brahma from his severe penance. He could not be defeated by anyone except by Shiva's son. Brahma advised the celestial deities that Parvati should get an offspring from lord Shiva who would be able to defeat Taraka. Indra requested Kamadeva to break Shiva's penance. To create a congenial atmosphere, Kamadeva (Madana) created an untimely spring (akƒÅla-vasanta). After he awoke Shiva with a flower arrow, Shiva, furious, opened his third eye, which incinerated Madana instantaneously and he is turned into ash. Lord Shiva agreed with Parvati's proposal and their pooja resulted the birth of lord karthikeya who defeated Taraka.Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, (1975) Hindu Myths: A Sourcebook Translated from the Sanskrit. London: Penguin Books, p.157-159 Rati prayed to Indra, who along with celestial deities prayed to Shiva that it was under their request that Kama disturbed his penance. Shiva gave a boon that Kama would be reborn in Treta Yuga in the womb of Krishna's wife Rukmini as Pradyumna and marry Rati. As per another legend, a sage named Theerthapahu, unaware of the power of Soola Theertham, the water body of the temple, prayed to bring water of rive Ganga for his worship. His hands were shortened during the worship and after realising the mistake, he punished himself by hitting his head against a rock. Shiva was pleased by his devotion and cured his hand. He came to be known as Kurungai Munivar (meaning a sage with short hands in Tamil) and the place came to be known as Kurungai, which eventually became Korukkai. The place has other names like Kamadahanapuram, Kampakapuram and Yogeesapuram. It is believed that Vishnu, Lakshmi, Brahma and Muruga worshipped the Shiva at this place. Architecture The temple is located in Korukkai, a village away from Needur in Mayiladuthurai - Manalmedu road. The temple faces the West and has a five-tiered rajagopuram. The temple tank, the Soola Theertham is located outside the main entrance. The sanctum houses the image of Veeratneeswarar in the form of lingam. The sanctum has ardhamandapa before it and a Mahamandapa, the worship hall. The Mahamandapa houses the metal image of Kamadahanamurthy sported with six hands holding six different weapons. There are metal images of Kamadeva and Rati. The images of Sanahathi sages are near the images of the presiding deity. The Mahamandapam also houses other metal image of Murugan, Somaskanda and Vinayagar. The shrine of Ambal in the form of Gnangmigai faces South. The image is sported in standing posture with four hands. The temple has two precincts and all the shrines in the temple are enshrined in rectangular granite walls. There is a hall called Sambuvinotha Sabhai (also called Kamanganasini Sabhai) which houses the images of Sivagami and Manikkavacakar. The temple is administered by Dharmapuram Adheenam.  Religious significance  A major shrine in the temple As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons namely Andakasuran, Gajasuran, Jalandasuran, Thirupuradhi, Kaman, Arjunan, Dakshan and Taaragasuran. There are Ashta Veeratanam temples built signifying each of his victories in the war, and also as places where he is believed to have performed with fury.Madhavan 2014, p. 145 The eight temples are: Tiruvadigai Veerattaaneswarar Temple at Thiruvadigai, Tirukkovilur Veerateshwarar Temple at Tirukoilur, Veerateswarar temple at Korukkai or Thirukkurukkai, Amirtagateswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur, Vazhuvur Verateswarar Temple at Vazhuvoor, Keelaparasalur Veerateswarar Temple at Tirupariyalur, Kandeeswarar Temple at Thirukkandiyur and Tiruvirkudi Veerataneswarar Temple at Thiruvirkudi. Shiva in all these temples are described to have used bow and arrow, trident and spear. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Tirunavukkarasar. The twelve songs of Appar are compiled in fourth Thirumurai as 49th and 50th canto. The thirty-one songs of Appar are compiled in the fourth Thirumrai ten each under 31st and 107th canto, while the remaining eleven in fifth Thirumrai under 11th canto. The ten songs of Sundarar are compiled in seventh Thirumurai in 28th cantor. Tirunavukkarasar describes the feature of the deity as:Tirunavukkarasar Tevaram, IV: 49: 7 The presiding deity is worshipped by devotees praying for mental and well-being. Festival and religious practices The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day; Kalasanthi at 7:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Veerateeswarar and Gnanambigai. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. There is a temple procession during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December- January) Thiruvadhirai festival. Kamadhahana festival during Masimagam during (February - March) followed by 10-day Brahmostavam are the major festivals in the temple.

Early life  Minchin was born at home in Flood St, Bondi to Alfred Hugh Minchin (1884‚Äì1954) and Dora Muriel \\"Bo\\" Minchin (nee Donaldson) (1883‚Äì1985). He was the youngest of the couple‚Äôs three children, the others being Helen Patricia (1910‚Äì2002) and Lester Hugh St Clair (1915‚Äì1993). The family was raised in various Sydney suburbs and Minchin attended Lane Cove Public School, Cammeray Public School, Chatswood High School, and Knox Grammar School. Minchin left school in 1934 aged 15 and became an office boy at the George Patterson Agency where he worked for two years. In 1936 he took a job on a ship and worked his way to England. In London he briefly worked for the advertising agency Samson Clark Price-Berry as an assistant on the Aspro account before landing a job with the Vick Chemical Company. As a trainee salesman, Minchin sold Vicks products in Ireland and the UK before being selected for further sales training in New York City. After success in a nationwide sales contest, from 1938 to 1939 he sold wholesale Vicks products throughout Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana as well as New York State. In 1939 Minchin was sent to Australia to conduct market research for Vicks. He sailed to Sydney on the SS Monterey. When war was declared in September 1939 he resigned from Vicks to join the Royal Australian Air Force.  WW2  Minchin enlisted at the RAAF office in Erskine St Sydney and was told that he would soon be contacted. In the meantime he took a job with Sheldon Drug Company selling fly spray in regional Queensland. By May 1940 he had not heard back from the RAAF and after making enquiries discovered that his enlistment records were lost. He signed up again in Rockhampton and was sent to No. 7 Course RAAF Bradfield Park. There he passed enough exams to be mustered as a pilot in the Empire Air Training Scheme. PO Devon Minchin beside his Kittyhawk aircraft. Sicily, 1943 (AWM collection) He was posted to No. 26 E.A.T.S. Guinea Fowl, Rhodesia to learn to fly on the Tiger Moth. He then went to 22 Central Flying Training School at Thornhill, Bulawayo to train on the Harvard MkI. Following flight training Minchin transited in Kasfareet, Egypt before being sent to defend Aden where he flew the Hawker Hurricane MkI. While in Aden, Minchin wrote his first novel The Potato Man, published by Frank Johnson in 1944. In 1942 Minchin returned to Egypt where he converted to the Curtiss P-40 (Kittyhawk) and joined No. 450 Squadron RAAF (\\"The Desert Harassers\\"). He flew 123 operational sorties and was mentioned in dispatches as part of the North African campaign in 1942‚Äì1943 and shot down a Messerschmitt Bf109 during operations over Cape Bon in Tunisia. Pilot Officer Minchin was also 450 Squadron's unofficial entertainment officer, penning poems and songs and leading the troops at the piano or on the ukelele at any given opportunity. He wrote Marlene's Boyfriend, a parody of the German propaganda song Lili Marlene which became one of the most popular Desert Air Force songs. After the July 1943 invasion of Sicily, Minchin contracted malaria and was stood down from operations. He became the lessee of The Grand Albergo dell'Etna and with fellow PO Harry Gregory turned the hotel into a respite for Allied officers. In late 1943 Minchin was assigned to production aircraft test pilot duties at No. 7 Maintenance Unit, RAF Kasfareet. He tested 19 different operational types of aircraft until he was returned to Australia in late 1944 due to the ongoing effects of malaria. Following a six-month stint training Army Air Liaison Officers at the School of Army Air Co-operation in Canberra, Minchin transferred to the Australian Army to join the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit. There he worked on the rehabilitation of Sandakan following the Japanese surrender.  Post WW2  In 1946 Minchin, his brother Lester and business partner Jack Bartle (former Commanding Officer, 450 Squadron RAAF) purchased a 110 foot, 85 ton ship called The Bellbird and loaded it with goods to sell in Borneo. They sailed from Sydney on 13 April but on their first night at sea they were struck by a big storm and had to scuttle the ship near Barrenjoey, New South Wales. In 1946 the Minchin brothers and Bartle organised a syndicate that was granted timber milling concessions in Sarawak. The following year they established Colonial Timber Company Limited (CTC) in Kuching. By the time of its sale in 1963 the company had the largest timber concession in the colony. The Minchin brothers along with John Cullity of Cullity Timbers of Western Australia then established Allardyce Lumber Company in the Solomon Islands. While remaining a director of CTC, Minchin returned to advertising in 1948 becoming Circulation Manager of The Straits Times in Singapore. His tenure was cut short after only a few months when his wife Susan died of polio on 24 April 1948. From 1949 to 1952 Devon Minchin was an account executive at Cathay Ltd, a Hong Kong advertising agency.  MSS  Minchin's MSS provided security for The Beatles on their 1964 tour of Australia. In 1954 Minchin founded Metropolitan Security Services which became Australia‚Äôs largest privately owned security company before it was sold to Mayne Nickless in 1970. When The Beatles toured Australia in 1964, MSS had the contract to provide security and Minchin took personal charge. He received a note signed by all the members of the band thanking him for allowing \\"the finest birds and best boomerang makers into the (hotel) suites\\". In 1969 Devon Minchin was the Founding President of ASIAL (Australian Security Industry Association Limited) which became Australia's peak national security industry body. In June 1970, thieves got away with $289,233 in cash from MSS‚Äôs Melbourne headquarters. It was at the time, Victoria's biggest ever robbery.  Later life  Following the sale of MSS, Minchin moved to Queensland where he farmed pineapples, bananas and paw paws on the Sunshine Coast. He developed a cinema complex in Noosa Heads and became foundation chairman of the Noosa District Tourist Association Committee. Minchin received a Bachelor of Arts from Macquarie University in 1978 and later his attention turned late Roman history. He completed a trilogy of novels set in 4th Century AD Rome and when he was at the age of 91 it was published as Love And The Fall of Rome. Minchin moved from his Yandina farm to Noosa in 2000. Devon Minchin died on 30 May 2014 aged 95.  The Money Movers  Devon Minchin wrote The Money Movers which was published in 1972. It is a novel loosely based on the 1970 MSS robbery and an armoured car heist in Sydney the same year. The book was the basis for the 1978 film Money Movers directed by Bruce Beresford. It was at the time considered one of the most violent films ever made in Australia.  Personal life  After meeting her when she was an Australian Army nurse in Labuan, Minchin married Susan Scot-Skirving at St Mark's Darling Point in 1946. Susan died of polio in Singapore on 24 April 1948. In 1952, Minchin married Betty Bentley (nee Rushbrooke) at St Jude's Anglican Church, Dural. Betty was a widow with a daughter Susan Elizabeth (29 Oct 1945 ‚Äì ) who Devon subsequently legally adopted. The couple had two children, Nicholas Hugh (15 Apr 1953 ‚Äì ) and Melody Irene (27 Dec 1954 ‚Äì ). Devon and Betty divorced in 1964. Minchin married Margo Brickhill (nee Slater), who was previously married to Paul Brickhill, in 1964. They had two children, Catherine Jeanette (25 Oct 1965 ‚Äì 28 Mar 1968) and William Devon Richard (27 Mar 1969 ‚Äì ).

He was called to teach at K√∂nigsberg in 1864, and at Strasbourg in 1871, where he taught until his retirement. The Imperial government appointed him as councillor of state of Alsace-Lorraine in 1879 and as a member of that state's legislature in 1911. He was a signatory of the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three that supported Germany's entry into World War I. Laband's writings on constitutional law are characterized by a formalist approach focused on terminology and logic, disregarding other rules of statutory interpretation such as historical, philosophical, political or teleological considerations. In a 1870 paper on Prussian budget law, he established the distinction made in German legal scholarship between laws in the formal sense and laws in the material sense. Laband was also influential as the editor of several leading law reviews and as the author of the textbook Staatsrecht des deutschen Reiches, which appeared in five editions until 1914.

Faber was born at Henneberg Farm near Fredericia along with eight other siblings. His father was a lawyer who moved to Copenhagen and became a brewer. Faber went to the Metropolitan School and then studied law at the university from 1813 to 1818. He then went on a visit to Iceland and returning in 1821 he became regimental quartermaster in the Sleswig Cavalry Regiment at Horsens working there until his death. Faber studied birds and animals as an amateur, travelling in the northern parts of Iceland and Jutland. His single book was Ueber das Leben der hochnordischen V√∂gel (1825). Faber noted that bird migration involved movements towards the poles to their breeding grounds. He also noted that young birds stayed on longer than the adult birds. Towards the end of his life he travelled to northern Jutland with his main interest in fishes. He kept notes on all his travels which are now in the Danish zoological museum. He married in 1825 and had two children.

CNA) is a peace organization focused on building sustainable peace in the region of former Yugoslavia. It was founded in 1997 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and expanded to Belgrade, Serbia in 2001. The organisation's main objective is to promote nonviolence and dialogue through trust-building among people from the region as well as a constructive approach to dealing with the past.  Mission  CNA focuses on cross-border work throughout Balkan countries. Its mission is to achieve sustainable societies, in which people value diversity, critical thinking, taking responsibility for their community, and willingness to reassess one's attitudes. Their work focuses on the promotion of peace as a basic social value, with the main focus of dealing with the history of the Balkan region.  Background  The Yugoslav Wars had a strong ethnopolitical background. In the post-war period, there was a strong need to find constructive ways to deal with the sufferings and disasters caused by the wars. CNA was founded as an initiative to bring together people from opposite sides, and to overcome the feeling of \\"being enemies\\" due to different cultural and ethnical backgrounds. Centre for Nonviolent Action was founded by Nenad Vukosavljevic, a peace activist from Belgrade, in September 1997, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The organization was started with the support of the German NGO Kurve Wustrow, an educational center for nonviolent actions. Throughout various phases of CNA's work, Berghof Research Centre for Constructive Conflict Management has been offering support in terms of supervision and advices. In 2001, a second office was opened in Belgrade, Serbia.  Tools  In order to achieve their values, CNA implements various tools, including peace education, peacebuilding, publications and video production.  Training  CNA works with various groups including teachers, journalists, activists, social workers, youth workers, and political party activists. Its main target group is young people working for NGOs, political parties and youth organizations, who are able and willing to spread their skills to the community. Since their founding, CNA organized several training programmes. Basic and advance trainings bring people from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo. Those programs focus on prejudice reduction, mutual trust building and constructive dealing with the past. Training for ex-combatants is organized for soldiers who actively participated in wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia in different armies, and focuses on encouraging dialogues and empowering veterans to participate in peace building. \\"Mir-Paqe-–ú–∏—Ä training\\" has been held every year since 2015 and pays special attention to understanding the context of Kosovo, North Macedonia, and Serbia. CNA also organizes training for students from Bosnia and Herzegovina, with goal of developing peacebuilding foundations for future generations of public opinion and policy makers.  Work with War- Veterans  The organization wants to work with war veterans from the 1990s in a \\"constructive\\" way. At the beginning of the project, right after the war, the organization was working only with civilians, mostly young people. However, in 2002, war veterans were included as a target group, as part of the project \\"Dealing with the Past\\". Many veterans were open to dialog and willing to work on reconciliation. Compared to the young civilians, they had a much greater impact on local media. Over time, the peace activities from CNA involved several groups of veteran associations in the cities across former Yugoslavia, and continued to hold trainings and public meetings.  Documentaries  CNA created a series of movies and documentaries. * \\"Small Faculty of Activism\\" (film, 2017). This film features Training of Trainers from 2014. * \\"Alien Home\\" (documentary, 2017). Its goal is to portrait the pain of those who are forced to migrate their home. * \\"The Fortress\\" (short film, 2013). Based on the book by Mesa Selimovic, in memory of a girl from Bosnia. * \\"Visits of Veterans\\" (documentary, 2009). Documentary film about joint visit of combats from Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia to the place of suffering. * \\"Not a Bird to be Heard\\" (documentary, 2007). Simulated dialog between Bosnians and Croatians. Theme is the war, suffering, hatred, pain, and difficulty of the past. * \\"All Wish to Cast the Stone\\" (documentary, 2006). Film from the series of simulated dialogs, which deals with attitudes between people of Serbian and Croatian descent. * \\"It Cannot Last Forever\\" (documentary, 2006). Documentary from the series of simulated dialogs, focused on attitudes of Serbians and Croatians ten years after the war in Bosnia. * \\"Traces\\" (documentary, 2004). Four former combats share their motivation to leave the war in the 1990s, their current views of the past, and knowledge they obtain in the meantime.  Criticism  During the first phase in Serbia in 2002, CNA dealt with some resistance. At one public event, a journalist questioned the credibility of a panel member by emphasizing her past employment in a newspaper that was close to Milosevic's regime. On another occasion, one of the local veteran associations tried to disrupt the panel debate. Some of the speakers in the first forum held political positions and there was an impression that they tried to use public forums for their agenda. A few days before a public forum in Sarajevo in 2004, CNA received a phone call from the veteran organization Green Berets, whose members opposed the idea of the forum. A lot of people attending the forum experienced the horrors of the wars and were not willing to address this experience. Some feedback from panels in Serbia and Bosnia was a necessity to involve people with more nationalist learning and to organize these panels across the wider region.

Augustine is an Associate Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York. Augustine co-directs the University of Rochester Batten Center, and is the Associate Director of both the Center for Health and Technology and the Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Research. Augustine‚Äôs clinical research and medical practice specialize in pediatric movement disorders. She leads clinical trials for Batten diseases, a group of rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorders, and she has developed a novel telemedicine model to increase the efficacy of remote care for patients with rare diseases.  Early life and education  Augustine pursued her undergraduate education at Harvard University. She majored in Biological Anthropology and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1999. Following the completion of her undergraduate degree, she attended the University of Rochester for medical school. She obtained her MD in 2003, and then moved back to Boston to pursue her residency training at the Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital. In 2008, she completed her residency training in Pediatrics and Child Neurology and then moved back to Rochester for her Fellowships. In 2009, she completed a fellowship in Experimental Therapeutics, and in 2010, she completed a fellowship in pediatric movement disorders. She then completed her Masters of Science in Translational Research at the University of Rochester in 2014.  Career and research  In 2012, Augustine was appointed to Assistant Professor of Neurology, Pediatrics, and the Center for Health and Technology at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC). In 2013, she became the Assistant Program Director for the Experimental Therapeutics of Neurological Disorders Fellowship and in 2015 she became the Associate Director of the Center for Health and Technology at URMC. In 2017, she was promoted to Associate Professor of Neurology, Pediatrics, and the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics. In 2018, URMC was selected by the National Institutes of Health to house the Morris K. Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Research and Augustine became a member of the executive committee, specifically the Associate Director of the center, where she serves as a principal investigator on FDA funded clinical trials. Outside of URMC, Augustine is a member of the National Institutes of Health Taskforce on Childhood Motor Disorders. She also bridges translational research with the clinic by working as a consultant to the Food and Drug Administration Neurological Devices Panel to expedite the use of informative wearable technologies in gathering data in patients with neurological diseases to track disease and recovery. She is also the Diversity Officer for the new NIH based Child Neurologist Career Development Program K12 (CNCD-K12) where she reviews applications of clinician-scientists to receive funding. She also organizes and oversees the Minority Research Scholars Program through the CNCDP-K12 which provides travels awards to individuals to attend the Neurobiology of Disease in Children Symposium and the Child Neurology Society Annual Meeting. In addition, Augustine is the Chair of the Scientific Program Committee for planning the Child Neurology Symposium. Augustine is also a member of NeuroNEXT, a network distributed across institutions and funded by the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders to focus on expediting the development of therapies for neurological disorders. Augustine has been featured on several media platforms such as WXXINews to discuss her research on rare neurological diseases and she has also been a panelist on Second Opinion TV.  Novel treatments for rare neurological Diseases  Since rare and orphan diseases are highly understudied and patients suffering from these diseases face very few, if any, treatments or cures, Augustine has dedicated much of for clinical research to understanding these diseases and developing therapies to treat them. She focuses on neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) or Batten diseases, which are a group of rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorders showing symptoms similar to dementia and parkinsons, often with blindness, seizures, and motor impairment. Her work has helped to elucidate the distinct characteristics of juvenile NCLs, in that they do not show myoclonic seizures to the same extent as other subsets of NCLs. Augustine has also begun to pilot studies of remote assessment of disease symptoms and progression through audiovisual technological assessment of neuropsychological symptoms. This work is critical since patients often have to travel from far distances to seek specialized treatment for NCLs, so remote data and disease monitoring would greatly enhance the quality of care and treatment. After characterizing the disorder and exploring ways to track disease progress, Augustine has taken steps towards elucidating pharmacological compounds to better target disease causes and treat symptoms in NCL patients. Data shows that inflammation and autoimmunity are characteristic of NCLs, so Augustine tested mycophenolate on patients with NCL, an immunosuppressant, to first see how short term administration was tolerated. She found that immunosuppression through mycophenolate was well tolerated in patients and they are now moving on to long term clinical trials to test the efficacy in reducing NCL symptoms.  Remote rare disease monitoring  Since remote disease monitoring is critical to effectively treating patients with rare disorders, who often do not live close to specialized clinic where they seek treatment and health management, Augustine has been exploring novel ways to best provide remote care to these patients. She has explored how telemedicine performs as a means of administering the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS) Physical Impairment subscale to assess disease severity. Using live video, patients are assessed by trained examiners, and they found that this method works well to diagnose disease severity in patients with Batten Diseases. Following up on this work, Augustine and her colleagues have developed a revised model for care for rare diseases, since the patient population and needs are different from common diseases where local care delivery is much more feasible. Her model includes the use of telehealth to remove geographic barriers to healthcare access while also enhancing for data collection and patient- provider-researcher communication.  Sex differences in neurological disease  Augustine‚Äôs research has also explored sex differences in neurological diseases. Anecdotal evidence from parents had suggested that females experience increased severity of Batten Disease symptoms, so Augustine sought to explore this further. She found that Females, on average, had later disease onset and earlier death in addition to an earlier loss in functional capability. Augustine has also explored sex differences in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. She has found that, overall, men and women do not exhibit differences in clinical motor impairment in the early course of the disease. She did observe differences in non-motor symptoms such as cognition, depression, and sleep disturbances.

He is best known for his design for the Holyoke Opera House, and his designs for a series of Newport houses. Early life Clarence Luce was born at Chicopee, Massachusetts on June 10, 1852,Massachusetts Births & Christenings, 1639-1915 at familysearch.com the son of Augustus Luce and his wife, Clarissa Elvira Clapp. As of 1855, the family lived at Haydenville, Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where Augustus Luce worked as a \\"brass moulder\\" in the mill of the Haydenville Manufacturing Co.1855 & 1865 Massachusetts Censuses, Williamsburg, Massachusetts. By 1870, Augustus Luce was a superintendent of the mill, living next door to the Greek Revival mansion of the mill's owner, Josiah Hayden.1870 US Census, Williamsburg, Massachusetts. In 1874, a flood destroyed the mill, but the Hayden family rebuilt it the following year to a design by Clarence Luce. Career Luce attended the Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts for four years, where he enrolled in the \\"scientific course\\" of study. In 1870, he moved to Boston to apprentice with the architect Gridley J.F. Bryant, and became, for a brief time, Bryant's partner. At the same time, Luce took courses at the Lowell Institute and attended lectures on architecture at Harvard University.Cuyler Reynolds, New York at the Jamestown Exhibition (1909), p.549. Luce worked for Bryant until 1874, when he established his own practice at 17 Pembroke Square (where he worked from 1875 to 1877).In the 1873 Boston Directory, Luce is a draftsman working at 17 Pembroke, presumably for the architect Gridley Bryant who had offices there. In the 1875, 1876, and 1877 directories, Luce has his own office at 17 Pemberton Square; in 1878 Luce has an office at 11 Pemberton Square.

Early life Maria da Concei√ß√£o Vassalo e Silva da Cunha Lamas was born on 6 October 1893 in Torres Novas in the Santar√©m District of Portugal. Her parents both came from well-off families. Her father was a Freemason while her mother was a pious Catholic. She had two younger sisters and was the older sister of Manuel Ant√≥nio Vassalo e Silva, who would become the last Governor of Portuguese India, and cousin of the children‚Äôs book writers Alice Vieira and of the writer and publisher Maria L√∫cia Vassalo Namorado. She attended primary and secondary school in Torres Novas, completing her secondary education at a boarding school run by Spanish nuns, from which her father removed her, concerned that she was developing a religious vocation. The nuns may not have been too disappointed: one was quoted as saying ‚Äúa demon left here‚Äù. At the age of 17, in 1911, she married Te√≥filo Jos√© Pignolet Ribeiro da Fonseca, an officer at the local Cavalry School. In the same year, and already pregnant, she accompanied her husband who was assigned to work at a military prison in Capelongo in what was then Portuguese Angola. Her first daughter was born there. In 1913 Maria Lamas returned to Portugal, again pregnant. With the First World War beginning, the marriage breaking down, and her husband being transferred to the front in Flanders and France, she was forced to look for a way of supporting herself and her daughters. She moved to Lisbon and started working at the American News Agency with the help of Virg√≠nia Quaresma, Portugal‚Äôs first female professional journalist. She also wrote for Portuguese newspapers such as Correio da Manh√£. In 1920 she was granted a divorce and in 1921 she married the journalist Alfredo da Cunha Lamas. The couple had a daughter but separated soon after her birth and were formally divorced in 1936. But she always kept the surname of her second husband. Career After her second marriage Lamas started to write for other newspapers, such as O S√©culo, and A Capital, as well as publishing poems (Os Humildes, 1923), serials, novels (Caminho Luminoso, Para Al√©m do Amor, Ilha Verde), and stories for children. Her works for women were more political and focused on improvements to women's rights. In 1928, she was invited to direct the supplement, Modas & Bordados of O S√©culo, at the invitation of the Brazilian writer Jos√© Maria Ferreira de Castro. Her work on this magazine, which lasted almost two decades, quickly led to the supplement's losses being reversed, as a result of her approach of writing \\"woman to woman\\" and questioning the traditional and conservative standards of women in Portuguese society. In 1936, she also created a supplement, Joaninha, for girls. She became friends with other female authors in Portugal, such as Branca de Gonta Cola√ßo. In 1936 she joined the National Council of Portuguese Women (CNMP), chaired at that time by feminist activist Adelaide Cabete. She began a relationship with Ferreira de Castro, often referred to by historians as being an \\"amiti√© amoureuse\\". They exchanged numerous letters, postcards and telegrams reporting on daily life, travel, thoughts, sadness, dreams and compliments about each other's literary work, ending only in 1973, the year before his death. Apparently, they planned for these to be published after their deaths. In 1930, she created, together with the CNMP and O S√©culo, an \\"Exhibition of Female Work, ancient and modern of a literary, artistic and scientific character\\", which intended to give visibility to women's work from all of Portugal. It generated much media attention and also raised her visibility with the CNMP, which elected her President for Education in 1937 and Literature in 1939. She was made an Officer of the Order of Santiago () on 7 February 1934, for her work on behalf of women. A year later, she joined the , where she got to know a fellow feminist and anti-government activist, Virg√≠nia Moura. From this time, she started to sign her work as Maria Lamas, having previously used pseudonyms such as \\"Serrana d'Ayre\\", \\"Rosa Silvestre\\", \\"Vagna Ina\\" and \\"Armia\\", the last mainly being used in the magazine Alma feminina, the official means of communication of the CNMP. Cover of the catalogue of the Exhibition of Books Written by Women, organized by Lamas In July 1945, she became president of the Board of the CNMP, with the promise of promoting literacy campaigns throughout the country. Soon after, however, the CNMP was declared a forbidden organization by the authoritarian Estado Novo government. She resigned from her position at O S√©culo and began one of her most important literary works The Women of my Country (As Mulheres do Meu Pa√≠s), the first ever report on the living conditions of Portuguese women. In 1947 she also organised an exhibition of books written by women. This brought together three thousand books by 1400 women authors from thirty countries, which filled the Great Hall of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon. In 1952, she published a two-volume work on The Woman in the World (A Mulher no Mundo), which offered a comparative history of the state of feminism around the world, the result of exhaustive research. Both The Women of my Country and The Woman in the World were subject to censorship, a fact that she found extremely frustrating. After the Carnation Revolution she announced that she was going to write a book saying all the things that she had been unable to say before under the Estado Novo, although no manuscript has been found. She also continued to develop propaganda against the Estado Novo and supported the aborted Presidential candidacy of Jos√© Norton de Matos in 1949. She was active in the Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD), which provided a platform for groups opposed to the Estado Novo. Her activities led to her being imprisoned several times in the Caxias prison near Lisbon (1949, 1953 and 1962). In 1949 she was kept in isolation for several months and fell very sick. In 1962, tired of living under the threat of arrest, she travelled to Paris. There, she met the writer Marguerite Yourcenar and translated one of her works. She began to develop activities to support Portuguese refugees who opposed the regime, only returning to Portugal at the end of 1969, with a guarantee that there were no arrest warrants against her. Throughout her time in Paris she lived in a small hotel in the Latin Quarter. For a time she was also exiled on the Portuguese island of Madeira. After the Carnation Revolution Following the overthrow of the Estado Novo as a result of the Carnation Revolution, on 25 April 1974, Lamas officially joined the Portuguese Communist Party. She also received several honours, becoming director of the Portuguese Committee for Peace and Cooperation; honorary president of the Democratic Women's Movement in 1975; and director of the publication Mulheres in 1978. She received the Order of Liberty () in 1980; was honoured by the Assembleia da Rep√∫blica in 1982; and also received the Eug√©nie Cotton medal from the Women's International Democratic Federation (FDIM) in 1983. Lamas had participated in the congress that set up the Federation, in 1946. Lamas died in Lisbon on 6 December 1983, at the age of 90, of cardiac arrest. In her home town of Torres Novas, in 1989, her name was given to the town‚Äôs industrial school, in celebration of its 50th anniversary. A small square had been named after her in October 1987. These changes were locally controversial, not so much because of her politics but because she was known for having a short temper, having had several fights with neighbours. Her name has also been given to several other roads and squares in other parts of Portugal.

It began in 1681 when Berkeley was not yet an adult and was discovered by her mother the following year. Berkeley was removed to the family seat at Epsom then escaped and went into hiding in lodging houses in London, under the protection of her lover. Her father, George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley, decided to prosecute her lover, Ford Grey, 1st Earl of Tankerville, in a trial which became a sensation in 1682. At the court of the King's Bench, Berkeley claimed to have left home with Grey of her own free will and also to have married William Turner, who was Grey's servant. After a scuffle with her father outside court, she was briefly imprisoned with Turner for her own safety. When Grey was implicated in the Rye House Plot the following year, the couple fled to Cleves, with Turner in their entourage. At the time, Berkeley was pregnant and it is not known if she returned to England with Grey for the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. She died in London in 1706. Scandal Lady Henrietta Berkeley was born to Lady Elizabeth and George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley, in 1664 or later. She was one of six daughters and there were also two sons. At some point in 1681, Berkeley began an affair with Ford Grey, Lord Grey of Warke, who was married to her elder sister Lady Mary. Berkeley was a virgin and an unmarried minor. The affair was discovered by her suspicious mother, Lady Elizabeth, in 1682, when she sent another sister (Lady Arabella) to check for evidence in Berkeley's room at Berkeley House (later Devonshire House) in London. A letter was discovered in which Berkeley had written \\"My sister Bell did not suspect our being together last night; for she did not hear the noise. Pray come again Sunday or Monday; if the last, I shall be very impatient\\". Berkeley family seat in Epsom Lady Elizabeth banned the lovers from seeing each other and took Berkeley to the family seat at Durdans in Epsom, outside London. Lady Mary was also there and she invited her husband to visit, not knowing about his adultery. Lady Elizabeth had been too mortified to tell either Lady Mary or the Earl of Berkeley about the scandal and therefore was forced to host Grey for several days. When he left, Berkeley escaped from the house the same night and followed him back to London. Berkeley then stayed at various lodging houses in London and her family set a reward of for anyone who could tell them her whereabouts. A note announcing the reward in the September 1682 London Gazette described her as \\"a young lady of a fair complexion, fair haired, full breasted, and indifferent tall\\". Grey told her parents that he was still in contact with her but refused to tell them where she was.  Trial  The Earl of Berkeley then decided to sue Lord Grey and his accomplices for conspiring to debauch his daughter. The prosecution charged Grey with \\"inveigling the Lady Henrietta Berkeley away, and causing her to live an ungodly and profligate life, carrying her about from place to place, and obscuring her in secret places, to the displeasure of Almighty God, the utter ruin of the young lady, the evil example to others, offending against the king's peace, his crown and dignity\\". At the court of the King's Bench, when the jury were about to retire to consider the case, Berkeley sensationally announced that she had left her home of her own free will and declared that she was now the wife of a William Turner, who happened to be a servant of Grey. The Lord Chief Justice, Francis Pemberton, told her \\"You have injured your own reputation, and prostituted both your body and your honour, and are not to be believed\\". When the court broke up, Berkeley's father endeavoured to take his daughter away, but she resisted. Swords were drawn and in order to break up the scuffle, the judge decided Berkeley and her alleged husband were to be detained in the prison below the King's Bench for their own safety. They were subsequently released. Grey was found guilty by the jury but received no punishment, as other events took precedence. After he was involved in the Rye House Plot of 1683 to assassinate both King Charles II of England and his brother (and future king) James, Duke of York, Grey was arrested then managed to escape when his guard fell asleep. The now pregnant Berkeley fled with him to the Netherlands in June, their entourage including William Turner. In July, Grey was indicted in his absence for high treason. They travelled to Cleves (then part of Brandenburg-Prussia); but afterwards nothing can be said for certain about Berkeley's movements. It is unclear whether she returned to England soon afterwards or carried on living in Europe and only moved back much later. Grey returned to England as a leader of the unsuccessful Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, then obtained a pardon from King James II, regaining his honours and later becoming 1st Earl of Tankerville. Death and legacy Berkeley died on 10 August 1706 in Tonbridge, Kent. Although it is not clear if they were still lovers, Grey, who died in 1701, had left her a life annuity of . She left a sum of in her will, of which went to her niece Elizabeth Germain. Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister was a contemporary novel which drew on the events of the scandal and was published anonymously in 1684. It is believed to have been written by Aphra Behn. Later, in the 19th century, George William MacArthur Reynolds wrote that Berkeley \\"unfortunately sacrificed her good name and affections of doting parents at the instigations of a consummate scoundrel\\".

Helen and Constantine along Luba≈Ñska Street in Zgorzelec was built in large part due to the financial support of the local Greek community. The Orthodox Parish of Saints Constantine and Helen in Zgorzelec (; ) ‚Äì is an Orthodox Christian parish in Zgorzelec, in the Archdiocese of Wroc≈Çaw and Szczecin. The parish has been functioning since 2002.  History =Spiritual predecessors The first followers of the Orthodox church in the vicinity of today's Zgorzelec and G√∂rlitz appeared in the 17th century. These were Greek merchants as well as refugees from the former lands of the Byzantine Empire. They rented a chapel in one of the local churches, in which they founded the Saint George's Orthodox church. It is unknown how long this Orthodox parish functioned. The next Orthodox church dates to the World War I, when the German authorities imprisoned 6,000 members of the Hellenic Army. Army chaplains were among those imprisoned, and they adapted one of the barracks into an Orthodox church. A legacy of those prisoners still visible today is the Greek Army cemetery in G√∂rlitz, among them the grave of Father Michailis Dimitrios. Greek and Macedonian settlement in Zgorzelec Greek and Macedonian refugees from the Greek Civil War were resettled in Zgorzelec in 1949. There were Orthodox clergy among those who had been relocated here, some of whom connected with the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church. One of them, Fr. Tsaldikas, was authorized in 1955 to begin holding Greek language services in Jelenia G√≥ra. The local communist authorities however, would not allow for the creation of a new Orthodox parish in Zgorzelec. Parish founding and church construction Orthodox Parish of Saints Constantine and Helen in Zgorzelec. Although over the decades the Greek community in Zgorzelec diminished as people returned to Greece, the many years of effort for the authorization of a new local Orthodox congregation came to fruition at the beginning of the 21st century. Jeremiasz, the Orthodox archbishop of Wroc≈Çaw and Szczecin consecrated the modest traditional wooden Orthodox chapel on May 29, 2002, while he formally erected the new parish on October 18th of that year. Fr. Marek Bonifatiuk was announced as the pastor. The church was renovated at the end of 2003 to fix certain flaws from its initial construction, as well as to install a contemporary iconostasis which was constructed locally. The church building was moved between July 15‚Äì17, 2013 to a new larger brick structure.Serwis Polskiego Autokefalicznego Ko≈õcio≈Ça Prawos≈Çawnego ‚Äì Cerkiew w Zgorzelcu na nowym miejscu [accessed: 25.07.2013] The new church will be composed of an upper and lower church; the patron of the lower church will be Saint George as an homage to the first Orthodox church in G√∂rlitz from the XVII.Serwis Polskiego Autokefalicznego Ko≈õcio≈Ça Prawos≈Çawnego ‚Äì Wmurowanie Kamienia Wƒôgielnego w Zgorzelcu [accessed: 29.05.2014.] The parish membership stood at 10 members when it was founded; it had 63 members as of July 2013.

The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Veerateswarar and his consort is known as Bala Gujambigai. The village is mentioned in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Vaippu Sthalam, the 276 temples that find mention in it. As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have punished the elephant taking the form of Gajasamhara. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and few yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty during the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam. Legend According to Hindu mythology, once, some sages doubting the omnipotence of the god Shiva created an elephant and challenged the god to a duel. Shiva took the form of Gajasamharamurti or \\"slayer of the elephant\\" and killed the elephant and wore its skin as a garment. As per another version, the sages residing in Tharukavana wanted Shiva to repent for his act of coming as Bhikshatana and inducing their wives to get them into conjugal mood. They created an elephant to fight against Shiva. Shiva tore open the elephant, whose skin started burning. The elephant fell in the Panchamuga tank opposite to the temple. Shiva is believed to have dipped in the northeast part of the tank and emerged from the southwest part of the tank. The aspect of Shiva is also known as \\"Kirthivasa\\" or \\"one who wears an elephant skin as garment\\". Vazhuvur is also one of the places where Siva danced his cosmic dance to crush the demon of ignorance. Since the demon Taraka inhabited this place, the forest is named Tharuka Vanam (the forest of Taruka). The place has other names like Parakayilayam, Gananbumi, Suyathapuri and Piplaraynam. During the great deluge, the village alone was not affected, leading to the Tamil name of Vazhuvur (the place which is not affected). Architecture The view of the temple from outside The temple is located in Vazhuvur, a village away from manganallur in Mayiladuthurai - Thiruvarur road. The temple faces the East and has a five-tiered rajagopuram. The temple tank, the Panchamuga Theertham is located outside the main entrance. The sanctum houses the image of Veeratneeswarar in the form of lingam. The sanctum has ardhamandapa before it and a Mahamandapa, the worship hall. The Mahamandapa houses the metal image of Gajasamharamurthy sported with six hands holding six different weapons and shown emanating out of elephant with elephant skin at his foot. The image is in the form of Om. The Mahamandapam also houses other metal images of Murugan, Somaskanda and Vinayagar. The shrine of Ambal in the form of Gnangmigai faces South. The image is sported in standing posture with four hands. The temple has two precincts and all the shrines in the temple are enshrined in rectangular granite walls. The temple has other important sculptures in the panels around the sanctum. The temple dates from the time of the Medieval Cholas. The Gajasamharamurti idol was sculpted in the 11th century. The temple is built in the Dravidian style of architecture and is known for its exquisite bronze icons. Some of the popular bronze idols are those of Gajasamharamurti and Bhikshadana (Shiva as mendicant).  Religious significance  As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons namely Andakasuran, Gajasuran, Jalandasuran, Thirupuradhi, Kaman, Arjunan, Dakshan and Taaragasuran. There are Ashta Veeratanam temples built signifying each of his victories in the war, and also as places where he is believed to have performed with fury.Madhavan 2014, p. 145 The eight temples are: Tiruvadigai Veerattaaneswarar Temple at Thiruvadigai, Tirukkovilur Veerateshwarar Temple at Tirukoilur, Veerateswarar temple at Vazhuvur or Thirukkurukkai, Amirtagateswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur, Vazhuvur Verateswarar Temple at Vazhuvoor, Keelaparasalur Veerateswarar Temple at Tirupariyalur, Kandeeswarar Temple at Thirukkandiyur and Tiruvirkudi Veerataneswarar Temple at Thiruvirkudi. Shiva in all these temples are described to have used bow and arrow, trident and spear. It is one of the shrines of the Vaippu Sthalams sung by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Appar. ‡Æ™‡ØÅ.‡ÆÆ‡Ææ.‡Æú‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Øç, ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ∞ ‡Æµ‡Øà‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç, ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç, ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Øà, 2009 Festival and religious practices The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day; Kalasanthi at 7:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Veerateeswarar and Bala Gujambigai. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi.

Produced by Tommy Allsup at Sumet-Bernet Studios in Dallas, Texas, it was released on March 14, 1977 as the group's third album on Capitol Nashville. Unlike the band's previous releases, all of which included covers of songs originally recorded by popular country and jazz artists, The Wheel features entirely original material (save for one traditional song), most of which was written by band member LeRoy Preston. Following the release of Wheelin' and Dealin' the previous year, Asleep at the Wheel expanded to an 11-piece unit with the addition of second saxophonist Patrick \\"Taco\\" Ryan. For the recording of The Wheel, the band and Allsup opted to work entirely in Texas for the first time, rather than returning to Nashville, Tennessee. As well as being the first all-original album by the band, it is also their first not to feature multiple additional musicians, with Leon Rausch the sole guest on just one track. The Wheel was Asleep at the Wheel's third consecutive album to register on the US Billboard 200 albums chart (on which it peaked at number 162) and to reach the top 40 of the Top Country Albums chart (on which it peaked at number 31). Just one single was issued from the record ‚Äì the Rausch- featured \\"Somebody Stole His Body\\", which failed to chart. Reviews for the album were generally positive, with critics praising the \\"fun\\" nature of the music alongside the high quality of the performances. Background For the recording of The Wheel, Asleep at the Wheel opted not to work in Nashville, Tennessee for the first time, instead recording their fifth studio album at Sumet-Bernet Studios in Dallas, Texas where Bob Wills' final studio album For the Last Time was tracked. The band's pedal steel guitarist Lucky Oceans recalls that the album was recorded \\"basically live\\" with no overdubs, resulting in what he describes as the group's \\"most live sounding studio album\\". After the recording completed in January 1977, the album was released by Capitol Records on March 14, 1977. \\"Somebody Stole His Body\\" was released as the sole single in June 1977. Reception=Commercial Upon its release, The Wheel debuted on the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart at number 40 and the Billboard 200 top albums chart at number 181. It later peaked at number 31 on the country chart (12 places lower than Wheelin' and Dealin) and number 162 on the main albums chart (18 positions higher than Wheelin' and Dealin). The album also reached number 23 on the Cash Box Top 50 Country Albums chart, number 153 on the Record World Album Chart, and number 14 on the publication's Country Album Chart. \\"Somebody Stole His Body\\" did not chart. Critical Reviews for The Wheel were widely positive. An uncredited review of the album in Billboard magazine hailed the record as \\"Some more first-rate western swing ... from a group that has mastered this form,\\" noting that it features \\"a powerfully authentic feel for music in the Bob Wills tradition\\". Similary, Cash Box described the record as \\"a highly compatible coupling of country and big band sounds that assures this band its own special niche,\\" proclaiming that \\"Western swing never had it so good.\\" Both publications awarded particular praise to Tommy Allsup's production, with the former enjoying the \\"solid, bouncy instrumentation\\" throughout. AllMusic writer Michael Ofjord awarded The Wheel four out of five stars, detailing that \\"The Wheel finds Asleep at the Wheel consistently making music full of fun, along with fine musicianship and a sense of purpose\\". In his review, he added: \\"What sets this record above other bands ... is a sense of integrity beneath the surface. However, that sense of purpose is never so heavy-handed that a feeling of festivity is too far away. [...] Asleep at the Wheel has made a fine record that will appeal to both the average fan and serious students of the Western swing tradition.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A‚Äì grade, his highest for the band since debut Comin' Right at Ya. Accolades Following the release of The Wheel, Asleep at the Wheel were nominated for two Grammy Awards: the album received a nomination for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while \\"Ragtime Annie\\" was recognised in the category of Best Country Instrumental Performance.

It is used to create and share short videos, and it pays its users for using the app and referring others. Zynn was launched on May 7, 2020. It became the most-downloaded app in the App Store in the same month. It has also been criticized for being a \\"pyramid scheme\\", and it has faced accusations of plagiarism and stealing content. Aside from Zynn in North America, Kuaishou is available under the name Kwai in Brazil, India, Turkey, South Korea, Russia and Vietnam.  History  In 2011, entrepreneur Su Hua co-founded Kuaishou with business partner Cheng Yixiao. Originally a GIF- making app, Kuaishou soon moved to short video content. Su Hua also serves as the current Kuaishou CEO. In December 2019, Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent invested $2 billion in Kuaishou, reportedly to compete with rival ByteDance. In December 2019, Kuaishou acquired an app developer called Owlii, which is the developer of Zynn. Zynn was developed to be a North American Market edition of Kuaishou. On May 7, 2020, the app was launched and it was downloaded over 2 million times in that month. On May 12, 2020, Kuaishou filed a lawsuit seeking compensation for \\"unfair competition\\", and accused Douyin, the sister app of TikTok, of \\"interfering\\" with search results on app stores.  Features  Zynn allows its users to create, edit and share short videos of themselves. Its interface has been described as a \\"complete clone\\" of TikTok, its main competitor. The Zynn app was unique in the way that they paid users for using the platform. Each user earned $1 for signing up, and they could earn money for referring users to the platform. Watching videos resulted in earning \\"points\\", which could be redeemed for gift cards or be cashed out via PayPal.  Criticisms and controversies  Multiple TikTok users had reported seeing their entire accounts plagiarized, with one account pretending to be Addison Rae. Despite being launched in May, many videos were posted in February. Zynn has employed \\"intermittent variable rewards\\" in its point system, which has been criticized as being the \\"same reinforcement strategy used to addict people to slot machines\\". Cash payouts for using the app have resulted in criticism and accusations of anti-competitive behavior. The app was taken down from the Google Play store on June 10. Zynn blamed it on an \\"isolated incident\\". Six days later, it was taken down from the App Store as well. US Senator Josh Hawley has criticized the platform, calling it \\"predatory\\" and \\"anti-competitive\\" in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking for an investigation into Zynn. He said that \\"[Zynn] smacks of a textbook predatory-pricing scheme, one calculated to attain immediate market dominance for Zynn by driving competitors out of the market.\\"  Notes  :1.Paying users to use an app is commonplace in China, particularly in smaller cities or towns where residents have lower income. It is seen in other apps such as Pinduoduo, Qutoutiao, and Weibo's Oasis.

He published a series of books and helped to create a permanent record of the magic of Dai Vernon through The Vernon Chronicles, Dai Vernon's Ultimate Secrets of Card Magic, and Bruce Cervon's Castle Notebooks. Biography=Early years Bruce Cervon was born Andrew Bruce Cernava (a Croatian surname) to Helen Rauzon Cernava and George Cernava in 1941. He changed the surname to Cervon (pronounced 'SIR-von'). Raised in Akron, Ohio, his introduction to magic came aged seven, through reading his father's copy of Professor Hoffman's Tricks with Cards, and through being given a Gilbert Mysto Magic set. He later found The Akron Novelty Company, which was the only magic store in the area. From an early age he performed for his fellow classmates as The Amazing Andrews. He subsequently joined the Akron Magic Club. As he grew older, he began performing professionally at fairs and outdoor shows throughout Ohio and for various civic clubs throughout the Midwest. His wife Peggi, billed as \\"Crystal\\", was his assistant. As a teen, Bruce also played guitar and sang in a few doo-wop groups, including Jordan and the Fascinations and The Caps. He played locally and recorded a few records. Don Tanner brought Cervon to the 1958 Columbus MagiFest. In 1959 he was asked to perform close-up magic officially there. At the 1960 MagiFest he met Larry Jennings and the two became friends through a shared love of close-up sleight-of-hand magic. Magic career At the Columbus MagiFest in February 1964, Cervon and Jennings discussed The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California, where Dai Vernon had recently taken up residence. Cervon had not yet met Vernon, but both he and Jennings were admirers of Vernon's magic. Jennings was the first to move to the Castle and wrote to Cervon praising Vernon and the newly-formed Magic Castle. Cervon followed him with his first wife Peggi, sleeping for a while on Jennings's floor. Cervon described the move as \\"The greatest thing I ever did in my life.\\" Jennings introduced Cervon to Dai Vernon, which led to them discussing and practicing magic almost ceaselessly. To pay the bills, Cervon got a job as a garment cutter in the Los Angeles Garment District, where he worked for nearly five years. The Magic Castle became the epicenter for the development of close-up magic in the 1960s and 1970s, with magicians such as Dai Vernon, Ricky Jay, Persi Diaconis, Doug Henning, Larry Jennings, Bruce Cervon, Michael Ammar and John Carney at its heart. The period has been described as the \\"Golden Age of Close-up Magic\\". Friction began to develop between Cervon and Jennings in the early 1970s as Vernon pitted the men against each other, separately challenging them to devise methods for effects, and suggesting the other had developed a better handling. However, in the 1980s their relationship improved, and they worked together on some of The Vernon Chronicles series. Cervon also spent much time discussing magic and developing close friendships with Dai Vernon, Jim Patton, and Mike Perovich. Cervon understood the importance of audience management as well as technical skills, and his performances were often praised by his peers. He was nominated seven times for \\"Best Close-up Performer\\" and won it twice. In 1970 he did a cross-country lecture tour (accompanied on the first leg by Dai Vernon) for which he won \\"Best Lecturer\\"; and in 2000 he was honored with the \\"Performing Fellowship\\", the highest Academy of Magical Arts award a performer can receive. Dai Vernon himself praised Cervon, saying, \\"I would place him right at the top with the other 'greats' in magic.\\" While best known for his close- up magic, his stage magic was also notable, garnering comments such as: \\"Bruce was a superb stand-up performer. Not only did he perform a couple of illusions, but he also floored me with one of the most commercial comedic stand-up routines I had ever seen.\\" Cervon was well known for his admiration for Dai Vernon, saying on one occasion \\"I've been the number one Vernon fan since I was a young boy\\", and for his careful recording of everything he learned with Dai Vernon at The Magic Castle. His notes grew to fill thirteen binders, and became known as the legendary \\"Castle Notebooks.\\" Later with Dai Vernon's permission the \\"Castle Notebooks\\" aided in the creation of \\"The Vernon Chronicles.\\" The Notebooks themselves were posthumously published in five volumes. Cervon was also instrumental in the production of the Ultimate Secrets of Card Magic (1967), and of its reprint in 1995. It is through his efforts that many of Vernon's accomplishments have been preserved. Vernon described him as \\"my long time good friend.\\" Cervon was appreciated for his willingness to discuss details of the art with other magicians: as one writer expressed it after Cervon's death, \\"These magical enthusiasts and hobbyists spoke of times when Bruce had taken the time to share his time and knowledge with them. To their amazement this legitimate superstar of magic had gone out of his way to make himself available to them. Each story was a little different. Sometimes it was when Bruce would sit down and take the time to really teach them a routine or a move. Some people had stories that touched on the other facets of Bruce such as his love of music. Each person had been lifted to a new height by the way Bruce had generously shared his time.\\" He was a member of The Academy of Magical Arts at The Magic Castle and served on its Board of Directors. He was a member of the Screen Actor's Guild, The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, and the American Guild of Variety Artists. He was also a member of The Magic Circle in Britain and of the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels. He was a court appointed expert witness on gambling for the California Superior Court and served as an expert consultant in the Los Angeles \\"Chinatown Bribery Case.\\" On his death, he was described as \\"one of our finest and most influential performer/thinkers,\\" \\"One of the world's most respected practitioners of sleight-of-hand card magic\\" and \\"He was one of the supreme players in our Magic Game\\". When asked to summarize what a performance of magic should do for the person watching it, Cervon replied, \\"It should blow them away. It should fool them. They should just go away from there going 'What happened? How did he do that?' They should be absolutely nonplussed. You want them to go away saying, 'This is the greatest thing I ever saw in my life.' The performance of magic should be an adult fairy tale.\\" Performances Cervon was an in-demand entertainer for corporations such as the Creative Artists Agency, Baskin-Robbins, Nesbitt, ELP Communications, Crown Zellerbach, ARCO, Centinela Hospital Medical Center, Press-Telegram, Lockheed, Santa Monica Hospital, Bristol Corporation, UCLA, Gibraltar Savings and Loan, Century 21 Realty, UCSD, Orange County Register, American Legion, Haggar Co., Southern California Gas Company, Co. Salvation Army, Bekins, Allstate Savings & Loan, Blue Cross, Searle, Valvoline Oil Company, The Daily News, Schick, Macmillan Oil Company, Borg-Warner Chemicals, General Electric, 3M, Citizens Savings and Trust Company, The Tonight Show, Chempar, Downey Medical Center, KIIS-FM, and Sunkist. He developed a relationship with Continental Airlines, with whom he introduced a long-running plan of featuring high profile magicians on flights back and forth from Los Angeles to Chicago. Cervon appeared on TV shows between the 1970s and 1990s, including The Mike Douglas Show, The Merv Griffin Show, That's Incredible!, The Jeffersons, Family Ties, Magic Palace and others. He also consulted or performed in many commercials, including for Pontiac, Bank of America, Continental Airlines, Pepsi-Cola, Shell Oil, and Rolf's Wallets. He also performed at high-profile celebrity parties. He performed frequently for such notables as Cary Grant, Orson Welles, Jack Benny, Bette Davis, Rosalind Russell, Gregory Peck, Jimmy Stewart and Elvis Presley. He became known as the \\"Beverly Hills Magician\\" performing for the Glitterati. He was Johnny Carson's personal selection for the annual Tonight Show party. Personal life Cervon met his second wife, Linda Lipps Cervon, in the Close-up Gallery in The Magic Castle, where, during his performance, he spilled a glass of wine on her. Afterwards she approached him saying, \\"I didn't want to ruin your show, but my purse and shoes were absolutely filled with wine. The least you could do is buy me another glass!\\" He apologized and spent the rest of the evening talking with her. They were married at the courthouse in San Francisco. They lived in Hollywood near the Magic Castle and the Farmers Market until 1992, when they moved to San Buenaventura, California just far enough to be away from the heat and smog of LA, but close enough for Bruce to continue his deep connection and love for the Magic Castle. They had a daughter, Marcella Alice, born in 1976, and a granddaughter, Eloise Eve, born in 2000. Bruce also had a daughter from his first marriage, Kellie Marie, born in 1969.

He served as Chairman of the Lupong Tagapagpaganap ng Pook (LTP) of Autonomous Region IX in Mindanao from 1979 until his assassination in 1986.  Early Life and Education  Ulama was born on November 10, 1939 in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi to Hadji Pangalampas Tugung and Hadja Naradja. He graduated valedictorian at Tubig-Indanan Elementary School (now Panglima Ibrahim Elementary School) in Simunul, Tawi-Tawi then went to Notre Dame of Bongao for high school. He obtained his law degree from the Zamboanga A.E. Colleges (now Universidad de Zamboanga) in Zamboanga City. Fresh out of college, he ran for mayor at the age of 23 in the 1961 local elections in Bongao but did not succeed. The following year, he married Elnorita Pamaran of Lamitan, Basilan. They both became school teachers at Claret College of Isabela. From 1968 to 1973, he was publisher of the Basilan Newsweek.  Career  In 1970, Ulama was elected municipal councilor of Basilan when he ran as the lone opposition candidate against the slate of former mayor Leroy Brown. At the height of the Muslim secessionist movement led by the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in the mid-1970s, Basilan became the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting between rebels and government forces. Tugung actively negotiated the surrender of thousands of rebels and saw to their subsequent rehabilitation. When the city of Basilan was converted into a province in 1974, Tugung was appointed provincial board member, and concurrently deputy governor to the military governor and OIC Mayor of Isabela. In 1976, he was appointed Executive Assistant of the Mindanao Executive Development Academy and subsequently promoted as Director of the Local Government Monitoring Office of the newly organized Office of the Regional Commissioner (ORC) headed by Rear Admiral Romulo Espaldon. In January 1977, he became the ORC's Executive Director. In May 1979, Tugung was elected Regional Assemblyman of the Regional Autonomous Government's legislative assembly. He was subsequently appointed Chairman of the LTP (Regional Executive Council) of Region IX in December 1979 and implemented massive infrastructure and social projects in the Sulu Archipelago and Zamboanga Peninsula. In 1984, he had a falling out with the Marcos administration during the 1984 elections for the Batasang Pambansa, for which he was consequently removed as LTP chairman, although he remained a Regional Assemblyman representing Basilan. He founded the Basilan United Opposition (BUO) and successfully campaigned in the province for Corazon C. Aquino in the 1986 snap election. He was reappointed as LTP Chairman on July 16, 1986.  Death  In the evening of November 22, 1986, Tugung and his aide, Anijay Jumaani, were fatally shot as they were emerging from Hotel Aurelio in Manila after a long day of conferences with other Mindanao leaders. He was interred in a Muslim cemetery in Tabuk, Isabela, Basilan. His widow, Elnorita, was appointed by President Aquino to succeed him as LTP chairman on November 28, 1986. In 1992, she was elected as Member of the House of Representatives for the Lone District of Basilan.  Memorial  For his contributions in Mindanao, Tugung Street in Isabela, Basilan and Tugung Avenue in Zamboanga City were named after him. In 1988, the Bob Tugung Peace and Development Foundation was founded with a focus on education by granting scholarship to deserving students and other education-related activities.

The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Veerateswarar and his consort is known as Elavar Kuzhali. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 276 temples that find mention in it. As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have punished Jalandhara. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and few yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty during the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam. Legend Legend of Shiva slaying a demon In the Shiva Purana, when Indra and Brihaspati were going towards Mount Kailash to meet Shiva, they met a mendicant on the way who was Shiva himself. Indra did not recognize and was asking him about the whereabouts of Shiva, for which the medicant did not reply. Getting infuriated, Indra used his weapon, the Vajrayudam on Shiva. Shiva was angry at Indra and immediately opened the third eye to destroy Indra. Brihaspati recognized Shiva and prayed to him, requesting him to pardon Indra. To avoid killing Indra, Shiva directed the fire from his eye towards the ocean. The fire when it met with the ocean created an asura who Brahma named Jalandhara as he was born out of ocean. He also told the celestial deities that since he emanated from the third eye of Shiva, he can be killed only by Shiva. Jalandhara under the aegies of the Guru Sukracharya became very powerful. He defeated all celestial deities and Indra. Indra along with other deities prayed to Shiva to destroy the demon. Jalandhara in the meanwhile, married Tulasi (also called Vrinda), the daughter of the Asura Kalanemi. Her chastity and devotion to the husband, made him even more powerful. Shiva appeared as Veerateewarar (also called Jalandharavathamurthy) There was severe fight between the Shiva and Jalandhara in Virkudi, with both showing equal prowess. Each time Shiva appeared overpowering Jalandhara, Tulasi's chastity was sving him. Vishnu in the meanwhile tricked Tulasi by appearing as a sage and bringing bad dreams to her. She approached the sage for relief, who created a mirage showing Jalandhara being killed by Shiva with the sage bringing him back to life. Tulasi was happy with the replica of Jalandhar, who was Vishnu himself. She lost her chastity on account of the incident. Shiva in the meanwhile, challenged Jalandhara to break a chariot, which he could not. Shiva killed the demon with the chariot. Tulasi, in the meanwhile cursed Vishnu that he would turn into a stone. Pleased by the devotion of her, Vishnu gave her a boon that she will be part of every Vishnu worship and she would acquire equal place in his heart as Lakshmi. Jalandhar, being born out of Shiva, got merged into Shiva. Architecture Veerateeswarar image in the temple The temple is located in Thiruvirkudi, a village away from Moongilkudi in Mayiladuthurai - Thiruvarur road. The temple faces the East and has a five- tiered rajagopuram. The temple tank, the Chakra Theertham is located outside the main entrance and another water body named Sangu Theertham is located behind the temple.

Bertha Mason (1855‚Äì1939) was an English suffragist and temperance campaigner. She was born to Betsey (n√©e Buckley) and Hugh Mason in Ashton-under-Lyne. Mason became a dedicated activist in the temperance and women's suffrage movements. She was a committee member in many groups including the National Union of Women‚Äôs Suffrage Societies and National Council of Women of Great Britain. Her book The Story of the Women Suffrage Movement was published in 1912.  Early life  Bertha Mason was born in 1855, the eldest daughter of Betsey (n√©e Buckley) and Hugh Mason. She grew up in Ashton-under-Lyne. Hugh Mason owned a mill and she was raised in relative comfort, although her mother died in 1861. Little is known of her education. Mason grew up in at atmosphere in which issues such as Liberalism, temperance and women‚Äôs enfranchisement were openly discussed. As Liberal Member of Parliament for Ashton under Lyne, her father had proposed a resolution on women being able to vote in 1880 and he was associated with the Central Committee for Women's Suffrage, the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage and the Manchester and Salford Temperance Union.  Career  Mason wrote in her 1912 book The Story of the Women Suffrage Movement that she herself became involved in 1890. By 1894, she was participating in both the Manchester National Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage and the Central National Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage. When the former group changed into the North of England Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society, she acted as chairperson until 1903. She was also politically active more generally, taking on various committee roles in the Ashton Women‚Äôs Liberal Association, the Lancashire and Cheshire Union of Women‚Äôs Liberal Associations and the Lancashire Union of the British Women‚Äôs Temperance Association. From around 1902 onwards she was involved in the National Union of Women‚Äôs Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). Addressing the junior members of the British Women‚Äôs Temperance Association in 1903, she told her audience \\"You are citizens of a State, whether you know it or not\\" and emphasised that \\"You will come to realise that the housing of the poor, the protection of infant life, the safeguarding of the workers, the care of the aged, the mentally afflicted, the education of the young, are your business, your concern.\\" Mason moved to London in 1904, living at 9 Hyde Park Place. She took on committee roles in the Women‚Äôs Local Government Society and the Central Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage. Her salon became a place for activist meetings. Mason prepared a slide show and lecture in the late 1900s, which was summarised as \\"pictures of unique interest of the forerunners of the movement, the advance guard, the parliamentary champions, the present day workers, election incidents\\". She toured NUWSS groups giving the lecture in places such as Bath, Croydon and Mansfield, and this then became the basis of her book, published in 1912. A review published the same year in The Common Cause magazine called it \\"a concise history of the leading events of the history of Women's Suffrage\\". Alongside books by Helen Blackburn and Millicent Fawcett, The Story of the Women Suffrage Movement is regarded as an official account of the Suffragist movement, focusing on a slow, continuous progression towards victory which neglects to mention some of the conflictual issues. During the First World War, Mason joined the British Committee of the French Red Cross working in kitchens in France. After the war, she resumed her activism, becoming chairperson of the Women‚Äôs Local Government Society. She also served on the National Council of Women of Great Britain and the Women‚Äôs Advisory Council of the League of Nations.  Death and legacy  Mason had moved out of London to Hindhead, Surrey, but died on 8 July 1939 at the Hans Crescent Hotel in Knightsbridge, London. She was cremated at Golders Green crematorium and had expressed the wish for her ashes to be scattered near where her sister Edith lay in the cemetery at Worthenbury in Wales. She left in her will and made a legacy to the Ashton-under-Lyne District Infirmary and Childrens‚Äô Hospital, where two beds were kept in memory of her father and sister.

After its inauguration in 1984 with a height of , it remained one of the tallest buildings in Delhi for years. It serves as the headquarters of the New Delhi Municipal Council and hosts the main server and the command and control centre of the civic body. The Palika Kendra is among 62 buildings and structures that the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage is trying to get designated as modern heritages of the post-independent India. On the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 31 January 2019, the Vice President of India, Venkaiah Naidu, inaugurated a grand wall mural of Gandhi made up of terracotta kulhars on a wall of the building.  Construction  The plot where the Palika Kendra stands used to host a tin shed that contained a small makeshift cinema hall for the entertainment of construction workers, who had been employed for developing and building the new capital of the British Raj. In the early 1930s, a building was inaugurated at this site for hosting the town hall of the New Delhi Municipal Committee. The town hall was demolished in the 1970s to make room for the new headquarters of the civic body. The Palika Kendra was designed by two renowned architects of India, Kuldip Singh and Mahendra Raj. Inaugurated in 1984, the Palika Kendra remains one of the few structures in India that features the Brutalist architecture style. There are 23 buildings from India that are included in the Atlas of Brutalist Architecture‚Äîa \\"comprehensive volume\\" documenting this architectural style from across the world. With a height of , it remained one of the tallest buildings in Delhi for many years after its construction.  NDMC Headquarters  The Palika Kendra is situated at Sansad Marg, New Delhi, and houses the headquarters of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). It is the tallest building owned by the NDMC. The main server and the command and control centre of the civic body are also located in the building. Public places under the jurisdiction of the NDMC, where video surveillance cameras are installed, are monitored from the command and control centre by computer professionals and Delhi Police personnel. During the COVID-19 pandemic in India, in May 2020, the headquarters was sealed for two days to be sanitised and disinfected after nine NDMC employees were found to be infected with the coronavirus.  Modern heritage  The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) approached the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in 2013 to designate 62 buildings and structures in Delhi‚Äîincluding the Palika Kendra‚Äîas \\"modern heritage\\", which would bring them under the protection of the Delhi Building Bylaws, 1983. These buildings had been constructed in Delhi after 1947 and are considered contemporary architectural heritages by different organisations, including the INTACH. Though the committee agreed with the proposal, it did not take any action on it for years. This attracted criticism from the High Court of Delhi in 2016, when the court heard a petition filed by the Delhi chapter of the INTACH related to the responsibilities of the HCC and the Delhi Urban Art Commission in providing protection to post-independence modern architectural heritages.  Mural of Mahatma Gandhi  A grand mural depicting Mahatma Gandhi made up of terracotta kulhars on a wall of the building was unveiled by the Vice President of India, Venkaiah Naidu, in the presence of Union Minister Giriraj Singh and the Member of Parliament from New Delhi, Meenakshi Lekhi, during the celebration of the Gandhi Jayanti on 31 January 2019. The mural was designed to pay tribute to Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. A total of 3,870 kulhars, made by 150 potters from a mixture of soil collected from different parts of the country, were used in constructing this mural.

Activism  al-Shirazi was an avid critic of the British- sponsored monarchy in Iraq, the communist tide that hit the country after the monarchy, as well as the Baathist regime that also followed. Along with his brother, Muhammad, he staged many protests and activities to counter the parties and their ideologies of communism and socialism. He used to display his sentiments in his poetry, that he would often recite in festivals and conferences set up in Karbala. In 1950, he set up the al-shabab al-husayni (), a youth organisation, as part of his anti-communist campaign. In 1963, during an annual function held in Karbala, commemorating the birth of Ali, al-Shirazi recited his renowned poem, za'imuna al-karrar (), criticising Britains meddling with Iraqi politics, the Baath party, and specifically its founder, Michel Aflaq: He also insults Aflaq by saying: Because of this poem, al- Shirazi began to face pressures from the Baathists, that led to his immigration to Lebanon in 1964. Whilst in Lebanon, he founded Dar al-Sadiq, a publishing house that produced many Islamic books. He then returned to Iraq, before Abd al-Salam Arif 's death. He continued his activism, against Abd al- Salam, his brother Abd al-Rahman, and later the Baathists, who assumed full control with a bloodless coup against Abd al-Rahman. The Baathists imprisoned al-Shirazi in 1969, and tortured him along with a number of other scholars in the Nihahya Palace. Due to the intensity of the torture, he was transferred to the military hospital, and then to a prison in Baqubah. He was released that same year, and shortly after, in 1970, immigrated to Lebanon. At first he sought treatment for the injuries he suffered under the torture of the Baathists. Then he resumed his activism, visiting many countries, and publishing more books and poetry. Through al-Shirazi's numerous visits to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj, he met with officials and the Muslim World League, and through them, in 1972, he managed to meet with King Faisal, where he discussed beginning the conversation in regards to rebuilding the Baqi cemetery. al-Shirazi's effort is considered to be the most progressive when it comes to any action carried out in regards to the rebuilding of the cemetery. However these efforts came to a halt with his death. Murtadha al-Qazwini states that upon meeting Mohammed Suroor Sabban, he told him \\"the current wall that surrounds the cemetery was built due to the efforts of Muhammad al- Shirazi and his brother Hassan.\\" al-Shirazi issued numerous statements against the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty in 1979. He aided a lot of activist groups in Afghanistan against the communist influence of the Soviet Union.  Legacy = Institutions  al-Shirazi established two seminaries in the Levant. He set up the Imam al-Mehdi school for religious studies in Lebanon and in Syria, he founded the Zaynabiya Islamic Sciences Seminary in Sayyeda Zainab in 1975.

Thirteen bullets hit al-Shirazi, mostly in his head, killing him. His corpse was transferred to Qom, Iran, where Ayatollah Marashi Najafi led the funeral prayers, and al-Shirazi's body rested in the Fatima Masumeh Shrine.

Levelfield was founded in 2010 by Arghya Banerjee, a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad who quit his engineering job to start the school. He planned on founding a school that did not follow the usual Indian teaching methods, which often give extreme importance to examinations or over-rely on textbooks and rote learning.

Position and course Am Kupfergraben runs as a riverside road along the Kupfergraben, a section of the Spreekanal which gives the street its name, and the Spree between the streets Hinter dem Gie√ühaus and Geschwister-Scholl-Stra√üe with the Ebertsbr√ºcke. The Monbijou Bridge (Monbijoubr√ºcke) and the Eiserne Bridge (Eiserne Br√ºcke) connect the street Am Kupfergraben with the Museum Island (Museumsinsel). History A first development Am Kupfergraben was already carried out around 1580, as a contemporary depiction shows: The Kupfergraben was called Ludwigsgraben for a while after its former owner, the Privy Councillor of State. The artillery barracks, completed in 1773 [No. 1-3], occupy the largest part of the street. Opposite the barracks on the Graben is the royal gunsmith's shop [No. 8].

In: Berliner Zeitung, um 1980 (Datum auf dem vorliegenden Zeitungsausschnitt nicht ersichtlich) However, most of the buildings were erected in the 18th century, after the regulation of the Spree arm, in the southern part of the street. Am Kupfergraben has been used by trams since the 1930s, initially only as the terminus of line 75. Since 1997, tram lines M1 and 12 have been running on the street between Dorotheenstra√üe and Georgenstra√üe.

She is known for challenging the stringent and orthodox societal norms and for encouraging muslim girls to receive formal and skill based education from behind the purdah back in the early 20th century. Begum herself attained formal education and took up a job as a teacher in Cuttack to educate young girls. She worked to promote female education and to abolish gender discrimination and gender injustice in the field of education. She is regarded as one of the first Muslim women teachers of modern British Odisha.  Biography  Badar un nissa was born into the illustrious Suhrawardy family of Midnapore, West Bengal, as the only daughter of the then subordinate judge of Calcutta High Court, Aminuddin Al Amin Suhrawardy and his wife Aaalam-ara Begum. She was the granddaughter of Ubaidullah Al Ubaidi Suhrawardy. Badar un nissa received her formal education in Midnapore . After her father's death, she was married off to Sayeed Mohammed, the eldest son of Atharuddin Mohammed of the Diwan family in Cuttack. In Cuttack, Begum Badar proved to be of a great help to her husband, they both started to work for the upliftment of the muslim society. She helped Sayeed establish the Muslim Seminary at Cuttack. After Sayeed's early death in 1922, Begum Badar un nissa was debarred from the family property and title as per the Shariat, nevertheless she did not let this or her widowhood come on her way in carrying forward her husband's legacy. In the early 1900s the idea of female education was still new in Odisha. Muslim girls were not allowed to attend schools or attain formal education outside their homes. Badar un nissa made her mind to educate the young girls who were shackled by the patriarchal and orthodox norms. Begum arranged for their education and took charge of it. She even arranged two purdaah-numa horse carriages for the female students and got them admitted to Ravenshaw girls high school, where she herself took up a job as a teacher. Badar un nissa faced resistance from the Muslim society for her actions, but against every odd, she continued to educate young girls in Cuttack. She used to go door-to-door to Muslim households and explain the importance of female education. She took the charge of educating young girls at school and also of bringing them to school safely in purdah and dropping them back home. In her later life, she worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment based on creed and gender. She even took the charge of spreading education among the downtrodden communities in Cuttack. She is regarded as one among the first Muslim women teachers of modern British Odisha. The Begum Badar un nissa assembly hall inside the Muslim Seminary at Cuttack is named after her.

The Atlantic called the Instagram account a \\"crowdsourced menagerie of mankind‚Äôs worst specimens.\\" The Instagram account accepts submissions of \\"insulting, ridiculous and sometimes outright threatening messages\\" women receive in online dating apps and posts them for commentary by followers. The Instagram account, started in October 2014, features screenshots of messages in dating apps forwarded by women who've received them from men. Tweten was a member of a Facebook group for Los Angeles women. One woman posted a screenshot of a message, \\"Asshole,\\" that she'd received on OkCupid when she hadn't responded to an earlier message. Other women posted tales of similar experiences of men \\"turning hostile when rejected or ignored\\" including Tweten, who posted about one man who had messaged her the same OkCupid line three times over a month, and when Tweten finally responded \\"No,\\" his response was \\"WHY THE FUCK NOT? If you weren‚Äôt interested, you shouldn‚Äôt have fucking replied at all! WTF!\\" Tweten concluded that \\"You learn that you can‚Äôt not respond; they freak out. But if you do respond, they also yell at you. You can‚Äôt win.\\" The commonality of the experience among the women on the Facebook group became an inside joke, Bye Felipe, a gender-flip play on Bye, Felicia, a popular meme for dismissing someone in an online conversation. Tweten started the Instagram to share and discuss such posts with friends and as \\"a way to make fun of men who tried to make us feel bad.\\" Within a few days she'd posted a dozen submissions; a writer for The Atlantic, Olga Khazan, stumbled across the account and wrote an article, calling Treten \\"feminist Tinder-creep-busting web vigilante\\" and the Instagram account became popular. By December 2014 the account had 278,000 followers, by 2016 almost 400,000 and by 2018 half a million. In a story for Ms., Tweten wrote she created the Instagram to commiserate with other women, let men know how those types of messages felt to women, and \\"expose the problematic entitlement some men feel they need to exert over women in general.\\" The book Bye Felipe: Disses, Dick Pics, and Other Delights of Modern Dating organizes the various types of men the inappropriate messages come from, \\"from Pickup Artist Peter to Michael Mansplainer and Trevor the Troll,\\" analyzes the messages to determine what they have in common, and provides suggestions for handling them. Tweten said she wanted to \\"create a handbook for how to handle any situation when you‚Äôre online dating as a woman\\" and that the book turned into an anthology of the \\"best ‚Äì or worst, I guess\\" submissions she'd received.  Reception  Frances Shaw, writing in the academic journal Social Media + Society, called Bye Felipe an example of feminist discursive activism by \\"highlighting of oppressive discourses in online dating.\\" Jess Zimmerman, writing for The Guardian, said that sites like Bye Felipe and similar efforts such as Nice Guys of OkCupid, Fedoras of OkCupid, and Straight White Boys Texting \\"aren‚Äôt just parades of female spite: they‚Äôre an important archival project showcasing the breadth of men‚Äôs casual, online misogyny.\\" The New York Post called the Instagram account \\"hilarious.\\" Lane Moore, writing in Elle and Cosmpolitan, called it \\"the best new Instagram account for your gross online dating messages.\\" The Young Turks in October 2014 broadcast a discussion critical of the internet shaming aspect of the Instagram account, saying that some men were jerks and women should just block them and move on.

Bush and the upcoming Allied invasion of Iraq. The criticism led to backlash from country listeners, who were mostly right-wing and supported the war. The Dixie Chicks were blacklisted by thousands of country radio stations, and the band members received death threats. The backlash damaged sales of the Dixie Chicks' music and concert tickets. Maines issued an apology, saying her remark had been disrespectful; in 2006, she rescinded the apology, saying she felt Bush deserved no respect. Background The Dixie Chicks formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas. By the turn of the millennium, they had become one of the most popular country acts in the US and the bestselling female band of all time. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, American country music featured patriotic sentiment more heavily than normal, in hits such as Toby Keith's \\"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\\" and Darryl Worley‚Äôs \\"Have You Forgotten?\\". Many American country fans and country radio stations supported President George W. Bush and the upcoming Allied invasion of Iraq. Market research found that the average country listener was white, suburban and right-wing.  Maines's statement  On March 10, 2003, nine days before the invasion of Iraq, the Dixie Chicks performed at the Shepherds Bush Empire theater in London, England. It was the first concert of their Top of the World tour in support of their sixth album, Home. Introducing their song \\"Travelin' Soldier\\", vocalist Natalie Maines told the audience: In its review of the concert, the British newspaper The Guardian reported Maines's comment and said that the audience cheered. Guardian reviewer Betty Clarke wrote: \\"At a time when country stars are rushing to release pro-war anthems, this is practically punk rock.\\" Entertainment Weekly speculated that if Clarke had not quoted Maines's remark in her Guardian review it would not have been picked up by American media. After Maines made her comment, another band member stepped forward on the stage and added: \\"But you know we‚Äôre behind the troops 100 percent.\\" The second comment was not widely reported.Gilbert, Calvin (June 20, 2003), \\"CMT News Special Explores Maines-Keith Controversy\\" , CMT.com, retrieved March 17, 2007  Backlash  Maines's remark triggered a backlash in the United States.Campbell, Duncan (2003). Dixie sluts' fight on with naked defiance\\" Guardian Unlimited. Retrieved April 13, 2006. According to a retrospective Guardian article, \\"Maines was seen as downright traitorous by many country fans for not voicing support for Bush and his war on terror.\\" Their single \\"Landslide\\" fell from number 10 to 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 in one week, and exited the chart a week later. The Dixie Chicks were blacklisted by thousands of country radio stations. On May 6, Colorado radio station KKCS suspended two DJs for playing their music. WTDR-FM in Talladega, Alabama, dropped the Dixie Chicks after more than 250 listeners called on a single day to complain about Maines's comments. Jim Jacobs, president of Jacobs Broadcast Group, which includes WTDR, described emotional callers describing family members who were members of the American armed forces. Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw noted that, by contrast, the stations continued to play the music of Tracy Lawrence, who had been convicted of spousal abuse in 1998.Maines in Austin, Texas, 2006In a poll by an Atlanta radio station, 76 percent of listeners who participated responded they would return their Dixie Chicks CDs if they could. Protesters in Bossier City, Louisiana, used a tractor to destroy Dixie Chicks CDs and other items. The Kansas City station WDAF-AM placed trashcans outside its office for listeners to dispose of their CDs, and displayed hundreds of emails from listeners supporting the boycott. Focus tests by Country Music Television found that audiences felt abandoned by Maines's comment. They particularly disliked that she had criticized Bush on foreign soil, feeling it was cowardly. Maines said she made the statement there because \\"that's where I was\\". The drinks manufacturer Lipton canceled its promotional contract with the Dixie Chicks. Maguire's tour bus driver resigned in protest of their remarks. Maines said: \\"It seems unfathomable that someone would not want to drive us because of our political views. But we're learning more and more that it's not that unfathomable to a large percentage of the population.\\" On March 12, two days after she had made her statement, Maines issued a disclaimer: The statement failed to appease her critics.\\"Upset About Bush Remark, Radio Stations Dump Dixie Chicks\\" , WCVB (Boston), retrieved June 17, 2008 Two days later, Maines issued an apology, saying: > As a concerned American citizen, I apologize to President Bush because my > remark was disrespectful.

I am a proud American.\\"Dixie Chicks singer > apologizes for Bush comment\\" CNN, March 14, 2003, retrieved April 9, 2007 Bush responded to the controversy in an interview with Tom Brokaw on April 24: On the same day, the Dixie Chicks launched a publicity campaign to respond to the criticism. During a prime time interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC, Maines said she remained proud of her statement. The band appeared naked on the May 2 cover of Entertainment Weekly, covered in labels given to them during the controversy, including \\"Traitors\\", \\"Saddam's Angels\\", \\"Dixie Sluts\\", \\"Proud Americans\\", \\"Hero\\", \\"Free Speech\\", and \\"Brave\\". The cover further alienated fans. Maines said that the band \\"have nothing but support for the troops\\" and did not \\"hate\\" people who supported the war. All the band supported Maines: \\"Natalie's comment came from frustration that we all shared ‚Äî we were apparently days away from war and still left with a lot of questions.\\" At their first show of the Dixie Chicks' American tour, on May 1 in Greenville, South Carolina, Maines wore a T-shirt bearing the words \\"Dare to Be Free\\". An anti-Dixie Chicks concert was held in a neighbouring town. Following death threats, metal detectors were installed at the Dixie Chicks shows, and in Dallas Maines had to be escorted by police to a concert and then the airport. She installed 24-hour security outside her home, and trash was dumped outside Robison's home. On May 21, at the Academy of Country Music Awards ceremony in Las Vegas, the Dixie Chicks' nomination for Entertainer of the Year was announced to boos. The award was given to Toby Keith, who had displayed a doctored photo of Maines and Iraqi president Saddam Hussein at his concerts. During their performance at the ceremony, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters \\"FUTK\\". Many took this to mean \\"Fuck you Toby Keith\\". Some Dixie Chicks critics responded by wearing T-shirts bearing the letters \\"FUDC\\". A Dixie Chicks spokesperson later said that the acronym stood for \\"Friends United in Truth and Kindness\\". In a 2004 interview on Real Time with Bill Maher, Maines said that she had believed that no one would understand the T-shirt. The performance drew further criticism from country music stations. A few months after Maines's comment, the Dixie Chicks performed and donated $10,000 for Rock the Vote, a website designed to encourage young adults to register to vote. Maines said, \\"We always felt like we were searching for ways to make an impact outside of music ... I believe everything that's happened in the last few months happened for a reason. A lot of positive things have come from it, and this is just one of them.\\"Devenish, Colin. \\"Dixie Chicks Rock the Vote\\" , Rolling Stone, July 22, 2003. Retrieved August 19, 2008. In a September 2003, Maguire told the German magazine Der Spiegel that the band no longer felt part of the country music scene. She cited a lack of support from country stars and the experience at Academy of Country Music awards, and said: \\"Instead, we won three Grammys against much stronger competition. So we now consider ourselves part of the big rock 'n' roll family.\\"  Response from other artists  Toby Keith performing for American troops in Iraq in 2008 Toby Keith displayed a doctored photo of Maines and Iraqi president Saddam Hussein at his concerts. Maines had criticized Keith the previous year, calling his music \\"blatantly jingostic\\". Musicians Bruce Springsteen and Madonna expressed support for the Dixie Chicks' right to express their opinions. Following the backlash, Madonna postponed the release of her \\"American Life\\" video, in which she threw a hand grenade at a Bush lookalike, and later released it in altered form.Havrilesky, Heather, \\"The Madonna video you can't see on MTV\\" , retrieved June 16, 2008\\"Springsteen: Dixie Chicks 'Getting A Raw Deal , NBC-6, April 24, 2003, retrieved June 16, 2008 Country musician Merle Haggard, who that year released a song criticizing American media coverage of the Iraq War, said the backlash had been \\"like a verbal witch hunt and lynching\\", and insulting to those who had died in wars \\"when almost the majority of America jumped down their throats for simply voicing an opinion\\".  Legacy  The events of the controversy were documented in the 2006 documentary film Shut Up and Sing. In 2006, Maines rescinded the apology she had made in 2003, saying: \\"I don't feel that way any more. I don't feel [Bush] is owed any respect whatsoever.\\" As of 2006, many stations still refused to play the Dixie Chicks. Focus tests by KFKF-FM in Kansas City found that listeners still disliked them; their program director said: \\"It's not the music, because we're playing them the hits they used to love. It's something visceral. I've never seen anything like it.\\" Maguire said: \\"I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with Reba McEntire and Toby Keith. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do.\\" The Guardian connected the blacklisting to a fall in female artists in the annual top 100 country songs, from 38% in 1999 to 18% in 2015. In 2006, Dixie Chicks released \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\", addressing the criticism. Sales of their next album, Taking the Long Way, and tour fell short of expectations. After their performance at the 2007 Grammy Awards, the Dixie Chicks went on hiatus until 2013. The Dixie Chicks and their position on Bush was cited as an influence by later country artists including Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves. Pitchfork described it as \\"a legacy tied both to their music and their message of integrity\\". In 2016, Maines told the New York Times: \\"I look at how much more polarized and intolerant people have become now. With social media, opinions all start becoming noise, but at that point, people weren't really supposed to have an opinion.\\" Robison said that the controversy \\"feels like another lifetime to me, it doesn‚Äôt even feel real ‚Äî our country‚Äôs changed, we‚Äôve changed, the fans definitely have.\\"  References  Category:The Chicks Category:2003 in American music Category:2003 in British music Category:2003 in London Category:2003 controversies Category:Boycotts Category:George W.

Biography  She was born in Eritrea, where her grandfather had emigrated to build the railway in the late 1800s, and where he had married an Eritrean woman. Her family, of Italian, Greek and Eritrean origins, moved to Rome between 1962 and 1963. Elvira began working at the age of 14 and was hired at the Italian consulate in Asmara in 1953. She obtained a scientific diploma and enrolled in law in 1961 at the Nigrizia Comboniana University of Asmara. In 1960 she was transferred to the consulate in Addis Ababa where she clashed with the directives of the Italian consul and ambassador. In the meantime, she also devoted herself to fashion, designing models and setting up fashion shows at the Italian club \\"Juventus\\" in Addis Ababa. She then returned to Rome at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where she took care of the daily press review for the minister. In Rome she founded the collective \\"Citt√† sessuale\\". In 1969 she participated as a young woman in Gianni Bisiach's program \\"The hour of truth\\", in which Indro Montanelli was interviewed, mentioning how he had bought, in 1935, a 12-year-old Abyssinian girl. Banotti intervened, embarrassing him as a colonialist and a rapist, until the transmission was interrupted. In July 1970 she took part with Carla Lonzi and Carla Accardi in drafting the Manifesto di Rivolta femminile, highlighting the topics that Italian feminism would later make their own: the pride of difference against the claim of equality, the refusal of women's complementarity in any area of life, the criticism of the institution of marriage, the recognition of women's work as productive work, and not least the centrality of the body and the claim of a sexual subjectivity, free from male requests. In 1971 she publishes the book La sfida femminile, a text that collects a large number of women's testimonies on abortion and which was slammed as \\"delusional\\" by the press, especially by the Communist Party. For the first time a book, starting from the historical condition of marginalization of women, conducts a deep study on demography and longevity. Together with other feminists, Banotti establishes the \\"Tribunale 8 marzo\\" to put religion and the Catholic Church on trial. For a banner that said \\"The Church conceived the theology of rape\\", she is herself tried in L'Aquila on charges of vilification of religion, but she is acquitted; the crime of vilification of religion will be abrogated shortly thereafter. In the early 70s Banotti went to a small village in the Sicilian hinterland, where a poor girl had been raped by a group of young people, and after visiting the girl's family she crossed the main street of the town at rush hour and entered the barber's shop, where she had his hair redone while lecturing the dumbfounded village men about the relational impotence of males, whom she deemed as congenital rapists. In controversy with Marxism and communism, she occupies the headquarter of the il manifesto newspaper, thus addressing its journalists: \\"You have never made us speak, nor have you ever published the writings that we have sent you; but we will speak the same. You failed comrades and you rambling Marxist women, you have for about a century prevented us women from speaking by appealing to superior reasons; in fact you fed the tradition of rape as a dishonest mediation with and among men, which is the raison d'etre of the false left. today, barring the way for any clarification brought by feminists, you represent in fact the last lie in the history of slavery\\". She was also a regular guest at the Maurizio Costanzo Show, in Giuliano Ferrara's L'istruttoria and in other TV programs, in which she attacked male sexuality, which she deemed predatory and without grace. Banotti used to claim that women were not at all interested in the penetrative sexual act itself. In the 90s and 2000s she wrote for Il Foglio by Giuliano Ferrara, to whom she did not spare criticisms anyway. In 1995 she attended the Beijing Festival and collected several interviews, making a video, \\"Parole di Sharazade\\", on his return. Over the next twenty years she engaged in a legal battle against the pornography broadcast by private televisions, denouncing, among others, Rete Mia, Rete A and Retecapri to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the Guarantor of Publishing and the Minister of Equal Opportunities. In an interview with Corriere della Sera she said: \\"pornographic advertisement instigate violence against women, presenting rape as an erotic game pleasing to the female\\". She also fought against prostitution, which shed used to define as \\"the organization of social rape ... perpetrated by a state that punishes collateral crimes, but tolerates violence always suffered by women\\", and opposed the reopening of legal brothels, including once by knocking a basket of acorns over the head of Tinto Brass. In 2001 she left her Trastevere apartment to move to Lavinio, where she died on March 2, 2014. In 2009 she joined the Eudonna movement. [8] In June 2013 she harshly attacked prosecutor Ilda Boccassini from Il Foglio for her \\"inquisitorial obsessions\\" towards Berlusconi and the \\"gay totalitarianism\\", in particular of Nichi Vendola. A controversy ensued with Giuliano Ferrara and Pietrangelo Buttafuoco.. In 2013, again on Il Foglio, Banotti criticised Minister Kyenge's plans to propose a ius soli reform of citizenship laws, which Banotti described as \\"a persecution for foreign babies\\" She has been called \\"a very tough separatist feminist, hated by most women who call themselves feminists\\", \\"a true progressive\\", \\"lonely, paradoxical, bold, controversial, prophetic, Elvira did not seek approval. Her triumphant vitality more often scares women instead of reassuring them\\". > \\"I don't care about anything men do or say anymore.

Four men were killed during the disturbances. Similar riots took place in Glasgow, Liverpool and other parts of England. Background The port towns of South Wales had attracted settlers from all over the world during the heyday of the docks in the latter decades of the 19th century. By 1911 the proportion of Cardiff's population that was black or Asian was second in the UK to London though, at around 700, the number was quite small and confined to the dock areas. Wages in the docks could be undercut by employing foreign men at a lower rate. The Cardiff Seaman's Strike in June 1911 had become focused on Chinese sailors, with violence breaking out one afternoon resulting in all of Cardiff's Chinese launderies being smashed up. The numbers of non-white settlers was augmented when soldiers and sailors were discharged from service in World War I, increasing the numbers of African, Arab and Asian residents even further. Trade on the docks picked up slowly, but not quickly enough to absorb everyone who had been demobbed from the war. Preference in employment was given to white men, though there were still many without work. There was also a housing shortage, compounded by resentment against non-whites who had bought houses and filled them with lodgers. There was also an antipathy towards non-whites who had married local white women (non-whites were almost entirely men at the time). Tensions erupted into riots in Glasgow, Scotland in January 1919, followed by port towns and cities in England, such as London, South Shields, Hull, and Liverpool in the first half of the year. Riots=Newport Rioting initially broke out in Newport on 6 June 1919. A black man was attacked by a white soldier, because of an alleged remark made to a white woman. This rapidly escalated, with a mob of white men attacking anyone perceived to be non-white, or anything believed to be owned by non-whites. Houses and a restaurant owned by black people, Chinese laundries and a Greek-owned lodging house were attacked in Pillgwenlly and the town centre. Eight houses in the docks area were wrecked, with furniture from two of them being burnt in the street. Cardiff Clashes took place on 11 June 1919 between white soldiers returning from the Great War and local Butetown (Tiger Bay) men of mainly Yemeni, Somali and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds. Riots continued for three days, spreading out into Grangetown and parts of the city centre. Ethnic minority families armed themselves and hid in their houses, some of which were attacked and looted. The main road in Butetown, Bute Street, ended up covered with broken glass and the windows boarded up. By Saturday 14 June, things has quietened down, despite huge crowds being on the streets the day before, and the occupants of a Malay-owned shop having to escape attack by climbing on to their roof. Barry Threatening crowds gathered in Barry on the evening of 11 June 1919, following a fatal stabbing in Beverley Street, Cadoxton. Dock labourer, Frederick Longman, had been stabbed by Charles Emmanuel, who originated from the French West Indies. (it later transpired that Emanuel had been told by Longman to \\"go down your own street\\" and had been attacked with a poker before drawing his knife). A black shipwright who lived in the same street tried to escape when the mob broke into his lodging house. The crowd caught up with him and pelted him with stones. The crowds didn't disperse until after midnight, but little damage was reported. Deaths Former soldier, Frederick Henry Longman, died after being stabbed in Barry. Three men died during the events in Cardiff: Mohammed Abdullah, a ship's fireman aged 21, died in hospital from a fractured skull, after being attacked in Butetown; John Donovan, aged 33, died after being shot at a city centre house in Millicent Street; Harold Smart aged 20 died after his throat was slit, though it was unclear whether this was directly related to the riots. Immediate aftermath As well as the deaths of four men, hundreds of people were injured and dozens were arrested. The damage in Cardiff cost the city council ¬£3000 to repair (over ¬£156,000 adjusted by inflation in 2019 value). The vast majority of people arrested were from the ethnic minority population. In Newport of the 30 people arrested, 27 were black. A total of 18 white people and ten non- white men appeared in court in Cardiff, with the non-white victims being initially dealt with far more harshly than their white counterparts. Nine black men from Cardiff were charged with murder and brought to trial in Swansea but, with the prosecution offering no evidence and reducing the charge to 'shooting with intent to murder', the jury did not even need to retire and discuss the case before finding all the men not guilty. Charles Emmanuel, who had killed a man in Barry, was sent to prison for five years for manslaughter, having been found not guilty of wilful murder. Legacy Though the riots were clearly remembered by the ethnic minority populations in South Wales, they were largely forgotten elsewhere. So much so, that when the Select Committee on Race and Immigration visited Cardiff in 1972, the police reported they had \\"no record of any serious disturbance involving the indigenous and immigrant population\\". Historians did not begin to record the history until the 1980s. There are still no memorials or plaques in Cardiff, Newport or Barry remembering the riots. ITV Cymru broadcast a retelling of the events, in the 2018 television series, 'Dock of the Bay\\". There was a revival of interest the riots at the 100th anniversary of the events in 2019. A group of Cardiff University students re-imagined the reporting of the riots, using 21st-century social media, on Twitter. In Barry, three centenary commemoration event days took place in September. A nine month Heritage Lottery Project was launched at Cardiff's Pierhead Building in July 2019 to examine the 1919 race riots.

In 1963 she co-founded the Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire. She began her career as a dog breeder and pet shop owner before merging her business with that of rival Molly Badham. The pair kept primates in their shared flat before moving, in 1954, to a larger house in Hints, Staffordshire where they established the Hints Zoological Gardens. Evans and Badham trained their chimpanzees to act out tea parties, which was noticed by the Brooke Bond tea company, who contracted the animals for a series of television advertisements for the PG Tips brand. After outgrowing Hints the pair moved their collection to Twycross, Leicestershire where they developed the largest primate collection outside of Japan. The Twycross Zoo became the first in the United Kingdom to breed colobus monkeys and bonobos and is now recognised as the World Primate Centre.  Early life  Sarah Nathalie Evans was born in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, on 12 June 1918. Her father was a Royal Air Force engineer and veteran of the First World War. Evans bred dachshunds for dog shows and began selling some of the animals, which allowed her to set up a pet shop in her home town. By the 1940s Molly Badham had established a rival pet shop in the town. In 1949 Evans sold a woolly monkey to Badham for ¬£35 (), the first in a long line of primates the pair would look after together. Evans and Badham soon entered into a professional partnership, consolidating their businesses. The pair lived together above the pet shop in Sutton Coldfield and kept chimpanzees in the flat, among the first of which were two called Sue and Mickey, who were trained to eat at the dinner table and use the toilet. On one occasion Evans and Badham returned to the flat to find that the animals had thrown many of their personal belongings out of the window and into the street below. The pair became well known among veterinarians for taking in injured or unwanted exotic animals and soon had a sizeable menagerie. Evans and Badham looked after Chudleigh, a chimpanzee belonging to the naturalist Gerald Durrell, while he was out of the country for a year.  Hints and PG Tips  Evans and Badham moved to Hints, Staffordshire in 1954, buying a house which they developed into Hints Zoological Gardens. A craze for chimps as pets in the 1950s left them with many animals from owners who could not cope with them. During a visit to London Zoo they witnessed a chimpanzees' tea party, a form of entertainment in which chimpanzees are dressed up in human clothes and provided with food and drink, which inspired them to recreate the experience at Hints. They were soon afterwards approached by the tea company Brooke Bond, who wanted to put on a chimpanzees' tea party at an event at Olympia London to promote their PG Tips brand. This was very successful, and the company booked the chimpanzees for a series of television advertisements that ran from 1956. Evans helped facilitate the use of the chimps by negotiating the appearance fees and contracts while Badham trained the animals. Animal rights activists criticised the advertisements as exploiting the chimps in an unnatural setting, and Brooke Bond cancelled them in 1968. However, Evans and Badham claimed the chimpanzees enjoyed performing and, after sales of PG Tips fell, the advertisements were reinstated. The chimpanzees were also in high demand on television programmes such as Blue Peter and Tiswas, for appearances at shop openings, and even for film roles such as in a Hammer Horror picture with Peter Cushing. Badham and Evans came to accept that the activity exploited the animals, ceased the tea parties at their premises, and ended involvement with Brooke Bond in 1977. PG Tips continued to feature chimpanzees, sourced from other trainers, in their television advertisements until 2002.  Twycross Zoo  Hints was overwhelmed by the number of visitors it received, and the escape of a large antelope into a nearby orchard caused bad relations with their neighbours. Evans and Badham decided to move to larger premises and, partly with revenue from Brooke Bond, purchased a Victorian house and of land near Twycross, Leicestershire. This was opened as Twycross Zoo in 1963. The Brooke Bond money helped to fund Twycross' conservation programmes that led to the first colobus monkey to be born in the United Kingdom, in 1969, and the first bonobo in 1994. It also funded the first studbooks, essential for safe breeding, for gibbons and chimps. The zoo expanded over the following years with former farm buildings converted into enclosures and neighbouring land purchased. The zoo was reorganised with ownership granted to the East Midlands Zoological Society, a charitable trust founded by Evans and Badgham, in 1972. The zoo became renowned as a centre for the care of endangered animals, with successes including a bow-legged former circus lion and an otter injured in a fight. Its particular specialism was primates, with Evans and Badham recognised as experts in the field, and it developed the largest collection of these animals anywhere outside of Japan. It is now recognised as the World Primate Centre. Evans was a member of the International Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens (now known as the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums) and a founding member, in 1966, of the National Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland (now known as the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums). Evans collaborated with Badham (and writer Maureen Lawless) to write two books documenting their lives and the foundation of Twycross Zoo: Chimps with Everything (1979) and Molly's Zoo (2000). Evans and Badham continued to hand-rear abandoned chimpanzees in their house until 2000 but retired from the zoo in 2004. Badham died in 2007 and Evans died on 9 September 2016.

It is located in the village of Kodumba in Palakkad district, southeast of Palakkad and southwest of Coimbatore in the valley of the Soka Nasini river, Kerala, India. Kodumbu temple is considered as half of Palani Murugan.Devotees believe that if a devotee takes bath in the Soka Nasini river, all his sorrows would fly away. History During Vijayanagara Period heavy tax imposed on Tamil weavers so some of the family members of SenguntharKaikola Mudaliyar had moved from Kanchipuram to Kodumbu near Palakkad and started the weaving industry. They load the weaving clothes in cow carriages and sell their textile products at Avinasi town near Coimbatore, then return to the town to buy the texts needed for weaving. One time when they left Avinashi and returned to the town, they heard a voice saying, \\"I am coming, I am coming.\\" Sengunthars went down and listened to the voice and looked around. There was no one there. Then, Sengunthars got ready to board the car again but the cow carriage stopped from there. They, with all their efforts, refused to go ahead with the cow. Then again, the voice of \\"I am coming, I am coming\\" was clearly heard. Sengunthars looked in the direction the voice came from. In the bushes there was a stone shining brightly. Surprised by the light, they took the stone and secured it in one of their bundles. The next minute, the cow began to move forward. After returning to Kodumbu, this people set up a unique shrine in the Shiva temple, placed a stone with it, and started worshiping as Subramanya Swamy which is Kuladevta for Senguntha Kaikolar community. Afer some years Arundhan Namboodiri, a Kurur land who performed pujas in the Shivaberuman temple, said that he would perform the poojas for Subramanya Swamy but the Senguntha Kaikolar family did not accept it, saying that the Tamil-style pooja should be done for their who hails from Tamil Nadu. Namboodiri did not agree to that. The Namboodiri appealed to the king of Palakkad. Thn king of Palakkad came there and made peace on both sides. When both are unacceptable, both factions should place kumbha on the north gate of the temple. The Palakkad king ordered that whoever takes the throne should be worshiping Lord Sumbramaniya Murugan regularly. On behalf of Senguntha Kaikolar, genealogy of Manikkavasagar was brought to Kodumbu from Madurai. He sang in Tamil and placed a mob. Namboodiri put up a mob with some magic. Namboothiri could not take the family of the boy. But the genealogy of Manikkavasagar has taken away the infidelity. Finally king saw this and ordered to worship in Tamil regularly. The unsuccessful Namboodiri donated a portion of his land to the Subramanya Swami temple. In exchange for his donation, the eminent capitalists approached the Kurur mansion of Akshadhan Nambudiri, Swami Swami's Thirumajana Kalam, four times a year, on the day of Lord Murugappurman's establishment and Navratri in the temple. Thus the history of the temple and its worship is told. Architecture The tower, chariots and chambers of the temple are constructed as per Dravidan style. In the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, Subramanya Swami, standing with his two wives Valli and Deivanai. The complex of the temple is also dedicated to Lord Shiva, Umadevi, Lord Parasurama, Lord Krishna, Shasta, Bhairavas. This temple also have statue of Senguntha Navaveerargal and Veerabahu who's were the ancestors of Senguntha Kaikolar. Cenotaph tree is the temple flower. Worship and Festivals Special rituals are performed on all special days of Lord Muruga. The Thaipoosam festival is celebrated for ten days starting from the month of Parani star day. Similarly, on the full moon day of the Tamil month of Ipasi to Kandasasthi, the Sura Samhaaram takes place well. The month of Sashti, Krittika days, Kartikhi Deepam, Panguni Uthram, etc. Chariot festival are also held in the temple. During Sura Samharam festival assording to traditional ritual where the Sengunthar Kaikolar dress as the Navaveerargal lieutenants of Murugan and re-enact the killing of the demon Suran. The statues of Lord Subramanya Swamy and Valli in the sanctum sanctorum are carved into the same statue. The Lord is thus called Lord Swamy Nimala. Devotees believe that if there is disagreement among married couples, praying to Lord Murugan to come to the temple, their grief will go away and a happy family life. The river that flows near the temple is called the Tragedy River. It is said that all the tragedies of those who worship Lord Muruga in the country will be gone. The Mahamaghat festival is held every twelve years on this river. The Mahamaghat festival is also held on the same day as the Mahamaga day in Kumbakonam. The temple is open daily to the devotees from 5.30 am to 12 noon and from 4.30 pm to 8 pm. Significance This temple Raja Gopura is the second tallest among all temples in Kerala. It is one of the oldest Murugan temple in Kerala. It is one of the temple which follows Tamil rituals and Tamil Sengunthar priest in Kerala.

Its molecule can be described as that of sucrose with its eight hydroxyl groups ‚Äì replaced by propionate groups ‚Äì. It is a crystalline colorless solid. It is also called sucrose octapropanoate or octapropionyl sucrose. History The preparation of sucrose octapropionate was first described in 1933 Gerald J. Cox and others. Preparation The compound can be prepared by the reaction of sucrose with propionic anhydride in the melt state or at room temperature, over several days, in anhydrous pyridine. Properties Sucrose octapropionate is only slightly soluble in water (less than 0.1 g/L) but is soluble in many common organic solvents such as isopropanol and ethanol, from which it can be crystallized by evaporation of the solvent. The crystalline form melts at 45.4‚Äì45.5 ¬∞C into a viscous liquid (47.8 poises at 48.9 ¬∞C), that becomes a clear glassy solid on cooling, but easily recrystallizes. The density of the glassy form is 1.185 kg/L (at 20 ¬∞C). It is an optically active compound with [Œ±]20D +53¬∞. The compound can be vacuum distilled at 280-290 ¬∞C and 0.05 to 0.07 torr. Applications Distillation of fully esterified propionates has been proposed as a method for the separation and identification of sugars. While the crystallinity of the pure compound prevents its use as a platicizer it was found that incompletely esterified variants (with 1 to 2 remaining hydroxyls per molecule) will not crystallize, and therefore can be considered for that application.

She was one of the best juvenile fillies in Japan in 2004 when she won two of her three races including the Fantasy Stakes and ran third in the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. She improved in the following year, winning the Fillies' Revue, Oka Sho and NHK Mile Cup as well as finishing second in the Shuka Sho and third in the Mile Championship. As a four-year-old she was narrowly beaten in the Takamatsunomiya Kinen and won the Hanshin Himba Stakes before dying of a heart attack in August 2006. Background Rhein Kraft was a dark bay mare with an irregular white blaze bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During her racing career she was trained by Tsutomo Setoguchi and raced in the pink and green colours of Shigemasa Osawa. She was ridden in most of her races by Yuichi Fukunaga. She was sired by End Sweep an American horse who won six races in the United States including the Grade III Jersey Shore Breeders' Cup Stakes in 1994 and was later imported to Japan to become a breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Admire Moon, Sweep Tosho and Swept Overboard (Metropolitan Handicap). Rhein Kraft's dam Must Be Loved showed no racing ability, failing to win or place in three starts, but did better as a broodmare as she also produced Admire Royal (Procyon Stakes) and Florentino (Jefferson Cup Stakes). Her dam Dyna Shoot was a successful racemare who won the Keio Hai Nisai Stakes, Tanabata Sho and Niigata Nisai Stakes. She was a female-line descendant of the Californian broodmare Fancimine who was imported to Japan in 1971. Racing career=2004: two- year-old season Rhein Kraft made a successful track debut when she won a maiden race over 1400 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 16 October. Three weeks later the filly was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 Fantasy Stakes over the same course and distance and won from Monroe Blond and eleven others. On 5 December at Hanshin Racecourse Rhein Kraft was moved up to the highest level to contest the Grade 1 Hanshin Juvenile Fillies over 1600 metres and finished a close third, beaten a head and a nose by Shonan Peintre and Ambroise. In the official Japanese ratings for 2004, Rhein Kraft was rated the second-best two- year-old filly, level with Ambroise and a pound behind Shonan Peintre. 2005: three-year-old season Rhein Kraft's trainer Tsutomu Setoguchi On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Rhein Kraft won the Grade 2 Fillies Revue, a major trial race for the Oka Sho, over 1400 metres at Hanshin on 19 February, beating Daring Heart and Air Messiah in a close finish. In the Oka Sho at the same track on 10 April Rhein Kraft started second favourite behind Cesario (Flower Cup), while the other sixteen runners included Shonan Peintre, Ambroise, Daring Heart, Air Messiah, Monroe Blond, Lailaps (Daily Hai Queen Cup), Felicia (Fairy Stakes) and Eishin Tender (Tulip Sho). Rhein Kraft was in contention from the start, went to the front in the straight, and held off a strong late challenge from Cesario to win by a head. Four weeks after her win in the Oka Sho, Rhein Kraft was matched against male opponents in the NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo Racecourse. Daring Heart was again in opposition, while the sixteen colts in the race included Big Planet (Arlington Cup), Meiner Hearty (New Zealand Trophy), Peer Gynt (Daily Hai Nisai Stakes, Shinzan Kinen) and Deep Summer (Crystal Cup). Rhein Kraft was always going well and won \\"effortlessly\\" by one and three quarter lengths from Daring Heart. After a four-month break Rhein Kraft returned in September when she finished second to Air Messiah in the Rose Stakes over 2000 metres at Hanshin. At Kyoto on 16 October she again ran second to Air Messiah when she was beaten a neck into second place in the Grade 1 Shuka Sho. On 20 November the filly faced older horses for the first time in the Mile Championship at Kyoto, a race in which she started at odds of 5.9/1 and finished third behind the four-year-old colts Hat Trick and Daiwa Major. She ended the season by finishing fourth behind the five-year-old mare Admire Groove in the Hanshin Himba Stakes in December. In the official Japanese ratings for 2005, Rhein Kraft was rated the second-best three-year-old filly, level with Air Messiah and eight pounds behind Cesario. 2006: four-year-old season For her first appearance of 2006 Rhein Kraft was dropped back to sprint distances for the Takamatsunomiya Kinen over 1200 metres at Chukyo Racecourse on 26 March and finished second of the eighteen runners, beaten a neck by the six-year-old Orewa Matteruze. In the Hanshin Himba Stakes over 1400 metres on 18 April the filly recorded her first win in eleven months as she came home two and a half lengths in front of her old rival Air Messiah. In the Victoria Mile at Tokyo on 14 May Rhein Kraft came home ninth of the eighteen runners, beaten five and a quarter lengths behind the winner Dance In The Mood. On 18 August Rhein Kraft died of acute heart failure. Pedigree *Rhein Kraft was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

He specialises in the accountancy of association football and authored the book The Price of Football. His expertise is frequently sought within English football media. Alongside comedian Kevin Day Maguire presents a twice weekly podcast entitled The Price of Football in which football finances are discussed. The Price of Football Maguire is the author of the book The Price of Football, and presents a twice weekly podcast alongside the comedian Kevin Day in which they discuss contemporary issues regarding, and listener questions concerning, the finances of modern day men and women‚Äôs football clubs. The podcast had a quarter of a million downloads within its first five months. This figure had doubled to 500,000 listens by May 2020.https://www.businesscloud.co.uk/news/how-to-produce-a-hit-podcast-during- lockdown Critical reactions The reviewer for the Columbia University Press wrote: \\"At a time when many commentators are bemoaning the effects of ‚Äútoo much money‚Äù in the game, this clear-headed and rigorous analysis and presentation of the financial imperatives and challenges facing football will be welcomed not only by students of the industry, but by the wider constituency of fans and supporters.\\" Margaret Decker, writing in Blues Trust said \\"The Price of Football by Kieran Maguire is an excellent book for anyone who wants to understand how money impacts the game of football. You don't have to be an accountant to understand it.\\" Stephen Mumford writing in Times Higher Education said \\"This book should be essential reading for anyone even remotely considering investing in football (and, unless they are super-rich, they should probably stay away). For general readers, it won‚Äôt exactly enhance your enjoyment of football, but it should at least increase your understanding of what goes on and why.\\" Writing in Soccer & Society, Steve Menary says of the book: \\"In chapters 1-6, Maguire offers a simple but cogent explanation of a set of club accounts, then in the second half of the book looks to place annual accounts within the context of real financial issues ...\\" and \\"Manchester United' supporters will be better equipped to make a more informed decision ... after reading The Price of Football.\\" Writing in The Guardian about the podcast, Miranda Sawyer says: \\"Obviously, this one isn‚Äôt for anyone who actively dislikes football, but for even a casual fan (me), it‚Äôs a very interesting listen. Kevin Day .., teams up with financial expert Kieran Maguire ...\\" and \\"Day asks the right questions and Maguire is impressive with his research: in last week‚Äôs show he pointed out that a newspaper financial football story was completely wrong, without being rude about it. The machinations of sponsorship, TV rights, stand maintenance, even crowdfunding, are laid bare, and somehow this sheds light on to the actual games themselves.\\" In November 2019, the podcast was nominated for the 2019 Football Supporters' Federation Online Media of the Year Award alongside FourFourTwo, David Squires, and eventual winners The Athletic. https://thefsa.org.uk/news/fsa-awards-2019-shortlists-announced/ Academic career A chartered accountant who has been involved in financial education since 1989, Maguire is Senior Teacher in Accounting and Finance at the University of Liverpool Management School, where he teaches the Football Industries MBA.

He had also been named the 2010 Lecturer of the Year by students at the University. In addition, Maguire won the Innovation in Teaching and Learning Prize 2010 for his developments in student learning.

The Express and Star described Maguire as a \\"Football finance expert \\" and quoted him extensively on the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the finances of football clubs.

History It was built from 1988 to 1989 by Niigata Tekk≈ç (now known as Niigata Transys), the KiHa 130 series cars were introduced as low-cost lightweight diesel railcars that could deal with the increased demand for rail transport in rural areas, in addition to replacing older diesel railcars such as the KiHa 22 and KiHa 40-100 series cars. Eleven cars were produced, all by Niigata Tekk≈ç, and were used exclusively on the Hidaka Main Line from their introduction on said line on 3 November 1988. However, problems with using these lightweight railcars began to show, with two cars being heavily damaged in accidents with level crossings in 1991 and 1996 respectively; car 5, the victim of the 1996 accident, was considered to be irreparable with most parts of the cars scrapped on site. By 1999, however, the cars were considered to have aged sufficiently to be replaced, with all but one car, 8, being withdrawn from service in 2000. Car 8 was later painted in a Hidaka Pony paint scheme and was used for additional services on the Hidaka Main Line until it was retired on 17 June 2001. There are no new diesel railcars were produced to replace the then-recently retired KiHa 130 series sets. Instead, older KiHa 40 series cars were selected to replace the KiHa 130 series cars on the Hidaka Main line; this is somewhat ironic as the KiHa 130 series cars were replaced by the railcars that it intended on replacing. And there are no KiHa 130 series cars appear to survive today; the last \\"surviving\\" KiHa 130 series car, 5, was last sighted in 2008 in a state of disrepair, with its bogies and prime movers removed. The car appears to have been scrapped at a later date. Design The cars are based on Niigata Tekk≈ç's NDC series of diesel railcars, so design language carries over. The cars are painted white with green accents; Hidaka graphics are seen on the sides of the cars. File:JRhokkaido_kiha130_5.JPGAbandoned KiHa 130-5 diesel railcar in Sapporo City in 2006.

All characters are introduced by the programme's executive producer, Mike Hobson. JJ Kenwright (Neal Barry) was introduced as a love interest for Mrs Tembe (Lorna Laidlaw) in February. Eve Haskey (Rachel Bell), the mother of Al Haskey (Ian Midlane), began appearing in March. March also sees the arrival of Karl Lee (Jimmy Roye- Dunne), the brother of Ayesha Lee (Laura Rollins).

Additionally, multiple other characters appear throughout the year. JJ Kenwright JJ Kenwright, portrayed by Neal Barry, first appeared on 17 February 2017, and made his last appearance on 30 May 2017. JJ was introduced as a love interest for established character Mrs Tembe (Lorna Laidlaw), when the two meet at a pheromone dating event. When their scents match, Mrs Tembe meets JJ but refuses to talk to him. After their date, Mrs Tembe collapses, she wakes up in hospital and is surprised to see JJ by her bedside, as he is a porter at St Phils. As she dislikes the hospital food, Mrs Tembe persuades JJ to buy her cooking ingredients and take her to the hospital kitchen, where the pair cook and bond. They bond over a shared love of literature, but JJ is dismayed to find out that Mrs Tembe is romantically involved with Charles Gupta (Amerjit Deu). He is later shocked to find out that she has ended her relationship with Charles, and the pair arrange a first date, where they kiss. The pair introduce each other to their friends, and Mrs Tembe is furious when Stevie Cocks (Brett Allen) jokes around about JJ's womanising ways. Mrs Tembe buys a bike for JJ, and on the way back from the showroom, they see Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh); Mrs Tembe introduces JJ as her friend, which he is upset by. To make it up to JJ, she introduces him to all of her colleagues at The Mill. The pair go on a holiday together, and when they return, they find Rob Hollins (Chris Walker) waiting on their doorstep. He asks to take JJ to the station, and asks for his whereabouts on 4 April. Mrs Tembe explains that they were having a meal at The Icon on that day, and brushes the interaction off. JJ lets friend Burt Haslop (Paul Broughton) stay at their house, but Mrs Tembe is furious to find that Burt is wanted by the police. She tells JJ that if he wants their relationship to continue, he must tell the police about Burt. He initially does not want to let Burt go to prison, but he tells Rob about Burt, and he is subsequently arrested. While having dinner with Mrs Tembe and Heston Carter (Owen Brenman), JJ is uncomfortable due to Heston bringing up his criminal history and recent unemployment, so Mrs Tembe changes the subject. Days later, she finds JJ drunk, throwing a party with bikers. He promises to find work, but Mrs Tembe is humiliated when she discovers that she has contracted chlamydia from him. The two visit a sexual health clinic, and when JJ begins making jokes, she is furious. JJ gets a new job in a biker bar, and quickly receives another job offer to work in a bar in Spain. He invites Mrs Tembe, but she insists that her life is in Letherbridge, so he leaves alone. Eve Haskey Eve Haskey, portrayed by Rachel Bell, first appeared on 6 March 2017. Eve is introduced as the mother of established character Al Haskey (Ian Midlane), who is recovering from the death of her husband. Eve and Al are not close, but Al decides to get in contact with her as he has unanswered questions about his dead father. Al accompanies Eve to his funeral, and she thanks him for joining her. Al arrives at Eve's house to stay with her during the Christmas period, and he begins to worry about her health. He asks Eve if he can perform a psychometric test on her to practice for a patient, but he later reveals that it is a dementia test, and that she could be suffering from it. Her case of dementia is confirmed, and Eve insists that she starts treatment immediately. Al asks if she wants to move in with him, but she refuses as she wants to live nearby to her friends. Eve invites salesman George Popwell (Damian Myerscough) into her house, and when he learns that she is financially comfortable, he tries to get her to pay ¬£1000 to fix her windows, which are not broken. She signs a contract which leaves her ¬£19,000 in debt to the window company, and when Al learns what has happened, he plants camera around her house. Eve acts innocent in order to make him take advantage of her naivety, and Al uploads the footage to the internet. Al arranges for Eve to go on an elderly outing led by Valerie Pitman (Sarah Moyle), but when Eve gets bored and leaves, Valerie panics and calls Al. He eventually finds her, and the pair argue as he assumes that she got lost due to her dementia. Eve meets Ray Hopkins (Bruce Alexander) at a pottery class, and the two begin dating. Al is suspicious of Ray when he discovers the pair are in a relationship, as he believes that Ray is a conman. Ray proposes to Eve, to which she accepts, but it is later revealed that he has several other girlfriends, fianc√©es and wives, but forgets them due to having dementia. When Al and Eve discover this, Eve kicks Ray out. Al stays with his mother again, and when she returns home from shopping, she forgets who he is. She phones the police, and Al has to prove that he is Eve's son. Al then asks if he can move in with her to care for her, but she rejects his idea and states that her condition is manageable. Karl Lee Karl Lee, portrayed by Jimmy Roye-Dunne, appeared from 30 March 2017 to 25 April 2017. Karl is the younger brother of established character Ayesha Lee (Laura Rollins), who arrives in Letherbridge to inform Ayesha that his fianc√©e has dumped him. When Rob Hollins (Chris Walker) demands to speak to Karl, Ayesha lies about his whereabouts, but later demands to know the truth. Karl claims to have no idea why the police want to talk to him, but Ayesha later learns that Karl has left the army due to bad health. Karl arranges to have an appointment with Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan), and he suggests that Karl could have depression, which he denies. They seek advice from another doctor, and Karl is diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Karl then goes missing, and Ayesha and Rob find him sleeping in the street. She takes Karl back to her house, and he stays there to recuperate for a few days. The pair say goodbye to each other when Karl decides to fly back to Germany to rejoin the army. Megan Sharma Dr. Megan Sharma, portrayed by Ritu Arya, first appeared on 18 April 2017, and made her last appearance on 14 September 2017. Megan is a psychiatrist, and a friend of Ruhma Carter's (Bharti Patel). Megan tells Ruhma that she would like to be introduced to the management of The Mill, and she asks if she would be able to work there. While there to meet Mrs Tembe (Lorna Laidlaw), Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan) accidentally splashes milk over Megan's feet. Mrs Tembe is impressed with Megan, and offers her a job at The Mill. Megan asks Jimmi out for a drink, and afterwards, he asks her out for a meal. Jimmi mentions to Megan that he is interested in becoming a therapist, and she recommends him a course. When he asks her out for another meal, she tells him that she is not interested in him romantically. Sid Vere (Ashley Rice) begins having therapy with Megan, but feels awkward in the sessions as he has a crush on her. Megan gives Sid an after work therapy session, and the pair kiss, and later have sex. Megan feels guilty about kissing Sid as it is against the medical guidelines, but Sid promises that he will stop therapy so that they can pursue a relationship. He takes her on a date, but Megan is disgruntled when he repeatedly talks about his ex-girlfriend, Ayesha Lee (Laura Rollins). When Sid sees Megan arranging another therapy session with patient Remy Briscoe (Jack Loxton), he assumes they are arranging a date. He confronts her about their relationship, and says that he thought they were exclusive. Megan is shocked at his jealousy, and makes fun of his mistake, but affirms that she is only interested in Sid. When Sid informs Mrs Tembe of their relationship, Megan lies and tells her that Sid is her patient, and that he is fantasising about their relationship. Megan is reported to the medical board, and she is later sacked by Mrs Tembe, and leaves Letherbridge. For her portrayal of Megan, Arya was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 2017 British Soap Awards. Besa Kotti Besa Kotti, portrayed by Aruhan Galieva, first appeared on 12 December 2017, and made her last appearance on 12 January 2018. Besa is a pregnant woman who has fled her home in Albania who Ruhma Carter (Bharti Patel) discovers in a rundown house where a group of Albanian women are living rough. Ruhma persuades Ayesha Lee (Laura Rollins) to treat Besa and the other women, and Besa explains that her father tried to force her to marry a rapist, and that the rapist is the father of her baby. Ruhma examines Besa, and finds that her baby is in breech. She suggests that Besa goes to St Phils hospital, but she refuses as she fears that she will be sent back to Albania. She also confides in Ruhma that she is a victim of female genital mutilation. Ruhma takes Besa to The Mill in secret, and gives her a scan, where it is confirmed her baby is in breech, so Ruhma persuades her to go to hospital. Ruhma tells Besa that she needs an episiotomy in order to protect her during the birth, and that she will need somebody to oversee the surgery. However, Besa does not want anybody else to be in the room due to her fear of being deported, so asks Ruhma to do it alone. The baby is delivered safely, and Besa begins staying in a hostel. When Home Office learn that Besa is in England illegally, they take her in for questioning. She explains to the immigration officers that she has experienced female genital mutilation at the age of 12, was repeatedly raped by a gangster in her city and, as a result, fell pregnant. She also explains how her family shamed her when she explained she was pregnant and tried to force her into a sham marriage.

Responsible for this process in mammals is the visual sensory system, the foundations of which were formed at an early stage in the evolution of chordates. Its peripheral part is formed by the organs of vision (eyes), the intermediate (by the transmission of nerve impulses) - the optic nerves, and the central - the visual centers in the cerebral cortex. The recognition of visual stimuli in mammals is the result of the joint work of the organs of vision and the brain. At the same time, a significant part of the visual information is processed already at the receptor level, which allows to significantly reduce the amount of such information received by the brain. Elimination of redundancy in the amount of information is inevitable: if the amount of information delivered to the receptors of the visual system is measured in millions of bits per second (in humans - about 1 bits/s), the capabilities of the nervous system to process it are limited to tens of bits per second. The organs of vision in mammals are, as a rule, well developed, although in their life they are of less importance than for birds: usually mammals pay little attention to immovable objects, so even cautious animals such as a fox or a hare may come close to a human who stands still without movement. The size of the eyes in mammals is relatively small; so, in humans, eye weight is 1% of the mass of the head, while in a starling it reaches 15%. Larger eyes have nocturnal animals (for example, tarsiers) and animals that live in open landscapes. Vision of forest animals is not so sharp, but in burrowing underground species (moles, gophers, mole voles, zocors, gold moles), eyes are reduced to a greater or lesser extent, in some cases (marsupial moles, mole rats, blind mole) they are even covered by a skin membrane.

Granniss (1872-1954) was an American librarian, known for her longtime position as Librarian of the Grolier Club, which she held from 1906 to 1944. Early life Ruth Shepard Granniss was born in 1872 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut to John Henry and Mary Witter (Shepard) Granniss. She had one sister, Miss Sarah Gray Granniss. She was initially educated by her aunt, Frances C. Shepard, and later attended the Rye Seminary, where she met her lifelong friend, Henrietta C. Bartlett.. She taught Latin at the Old Saybrook School from 1894 to 1901, and, like Bartlett, attended the Pratt Institute Library School, from which she graduated in 1902. She served as president of the Graduates' Association of the Pratt Institute School of Library Science from 1909-1910. Granniss became a friend and colleague of the Pratt Institute's director, Mary Wright Plummer. In 1917, Ruth and her mother Mary were in a serious streetcar wreck while Ruth was visiting her family in Connecticut. Her mother was killed, and Ruth suffered serious injuries. She recuperated slowly at San Raphael Hospital in New Haven. Her colleagues at the Grolier Club helped defray her hospital expenses. Career Grannis was notable as the longtime Librarian of the Grolier Club, a role which she held from 1906 to 1944. She began her career with the club as a cataloger and assistant to her predecessor, Henry Watson Kent, in 1904. Upon Kent's retirement in 1906, Granniss became Librarian. In her early years, she was mentored by bibliographer Beverly Chew. During the nearly four decades of her tenure, she helped grow the Club's library from 8,000 volumes in 1904 to almost 40,000 volumes in 1944, helped develop the club's prominent bookplate collection. In 1917, she supervised the Club's move to its new headquarters at 47 East 60th Street, New York, and directed the installation of its collections in the new building. At its new location, Granniss reportedly worked to make the library more open, inviting \\"non-members, including women and outside scholars\\" to use the reading room. In 1928, she travelled to Europe with her friend Henrietta C. Bartlett. Though it was a pleasure trip, she was authorized by the Grolier Club Library Committee to make purchases for the Club while she was abroad. In 1935, a reception was held in her honor to celebrate her thirtieth anniversary as the Librarian. Over her career, she authored over twenty books and articles, and organized several exhibitions and their corresponding catalogues for the Club. She was in frequent correspondence with other scholars and librarians, and gave regular lectures on various aspects of book history. She was said to be modest, and reportedly never allowed herself to be photographed (Mildred Abraham suggests that this reticence may be due in part to facial scarring from injuries sustained in the streetcar accident in 1917). Despite her position and contributions, she was barred from membership in the Grolier Club (which remained a male-only organization until 1976), and was unable to attend most of its events. She retired from the librarian role in 1944 (with a pension of $100 per month, and a cash gift of $1497 from Club members), and holds the distinction of having the longest single tenure as librarian in the club's history. George Leslie McKay, who had been appointed as her assistant in 1923, succeeded her as librarian. Later life and death Granniss was a member of the New York Library Club and the Bibliographical Society of America. In the 1930s, she was an early contributor to The Colophon. In 1944, she was one of the founding members of the Hroswitha Club, a group of women bibliophiles. In 1945, she moved from New York back to Old Saybrook, Connecticut to live with her sister Sarah. She died in March 1954, possibly following a stroke earlier in the year. Selected publications *A garland of poppies (with Henrietta C.

Dedicated in 1871, it is the first Confederate monument to be erected in Mississippi and one of the earliest such monuments in the United States. In 1988, it was designated a Mississippi Landmark.  History  The cornerstone for the monument was laid in 1866 at a small park area near Liberty Presbyterian Church in downtown Liberty, Mississippi. The land would be donated by the Liberty Lodge of Masons in 1868. The Amite County Monument and Historical Association had been formed in 1866 and proceeded to raise over $3,300 over the next five years for the creation of a monument dedicated to dead Confederate soldiers from Amite County, Mississippi. The association hired A. J. Lewis of Brookhaven, Mississippi to design the monument, which was completed in March 1871. The monument had been built in New Orleans and shipped to Liberty, being transported by oxen for the last 30 miles to the town. The monument was officially dedicated the following month on April 26. The monument is notable for being the first Confederate monument in Mississippi. On December 15, 1988, the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH) designated the monument a Mississippi Landmark. It was recorded on February 6 of the following year. In 2002, the MDAH erected a historical marker near the monument.

The organization is based in New York City and was founded by Ianne Fields Stewart.  History  Ianne Fields Stewart founded The Okra Project in January 2018 with a friend, Nyla Sampson, to combat food insecurity among black trans people. The organization's mission is to hire and train black trans people as chefs who then provide meals for black trans people in their homes. They collaborated with chef Meliq August, who runs a trans chef service. The provided meals are African diasporic cuisines. After its founding, Stewart stated the intention to run the New York-based collective, which operates entirely on individual donations, until its funds are depleted. In light of social distancing requirements implemented in New York related to COVID-19, The Okra Project switched to providing groceries to black trans people and raising money for mental health services. As of June 2020, the organization has provided groceries to thousands of people and provided home cooked meals to at least 200. The organization also expanded to Philadelphia and New Jersey due to high demand.  Founder  Stewart is a black queer non-binary trans feminine activist and actor. She has spoken on the importance of black trans-led initiatives.  Mental health funds  In 2020 The Okra Project created the Nina Pop Mental Health Recovery Fund and the Tony McDade Mental Health Recovery Fund, named after two black trans people killed in May of that year. The fund pays for the cost of one free mental health therapy session for black trans men, women, and nonbinary people. Jack Dorsey donated $75,000 to the funds, and Stewart stated that the organization received about $100,000 in donations every day over an eleven-day period due to people's donations related to the George Floyd protests.

He is considered to be one of the most influential psychologists in the history of South Africa, and a 1991 obituary described him as \\"the doyen of psychologists in South Africa.\\" Early life and education Biesheuvel was born on 3 April 1908 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. He was the oldest of four children of a father whose managerial career necessitated frequent moves. As a result, by the time Simon was a teenager, he had attended schools in five cities in four countries. Simon and his family moved to Cape Town, South Africa, in 1922, when he was fourteen. He received his B. A. degree from the University of Cape Town in 1929, where he majored in both psychology and English. He received his M. A. degree in psychology in 1930, also from the University of Cape Town, after which he traveled to Scotland to receive his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1933. Career From 1934 to 1935, Biesheuvel lectured in psychology at Stellenbosch University, and held the same position at the University of the Witwatersrand from 1936 to 1940. In 1940, during World War II, he was hired by the South African Air Force as the Officer Commanding of their Aptitude Test Section; he continued to hold this position until 1946. In 1946, he established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's National Institute for Personnel Research, of which he served as the founding director from then until 1962. In recognition of his research on African perceptions of European customs, he was honored by the South African Association for the Advancement of Science with their Durban Medal in 1956. He received the South Africa Medal from the same Association in 1962. In 1959, he delivered the fifteenth annual Alfred and Winifred Hoernl√© Memorial Lecture. Work Biesheuvel is noted for a 1943 monograph in which he argued for an environmental interpretation of the gap in intelligence test scores between whites and blacks in South Africa. In making these arguments, Biesheuvel also criticized the views of hereditarian psychologists such as M. L. Fick and Carl Brigham. Personal life and death Biesheuvel married Erica Sharpley, and together they had two daughters: Mary Ann and Sally. Biesheuvel died on 13 June 1991 at his home in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Two headwater tributaries both named Afon Rhiw flow east to join at Dwyrhiew and then continue in a generally easterly direction to join the River Severn east of Berriew ( ‚Äòmouth of the Rhiw‚Äô). The northern Rhiw emerges from Llyn y Bugail (Welsh: ‚Äòlake of the shepherd‚Äô) on Mynydd Waun Fawr whilst the southern Rhiw rises near Mynydd Dwyriw. The combined river flows past the hamlets of New Mills (), Manafon and Pant-y- ffridd, accompanied by the B4390 road all the way to Berriew. Other tributaries include the Nant Wtre-wen, Crygnant, Nant y Llyn Mawr and Dolgar Brook. It is bridged and forded at numerous points, one of which is an aqueduct carrying the Montgomery Canal over it at Berriew. At the eastern end of the river is Glansevern Hall and gardens. Etymology The Welsh word rhiw means 'slope' in which case it would be 'slope river' but it is suggested that it may be derived from a British word riu meaning stream. The modern anglicised name Berriew is derived from Aberriw ('aber' + mutated 'rhiw' signifying 'mouth of the Rhiw') References River Rhiw ","title":"River Rhiw"},{"id":"64274075","title":"Dream Team (album)"},{"id":"64274076","text":"Kortner is a surname.

The song was performed by the Norwegian vocal group Trio Mediaeval. In 2015, it was adapted for use in the soundtrack for the comedy-drama film Youth, directed by Paolo Sorrentino. The song is based on language from the Song of Songs in the Old Testament. It has received widespread acclaim from various news sources and music review websites, including The New York Times, The Guardian, and New York Public Radio.  Production  The song was originally commissioned by the Louth Contemporary Music Society as part of their 2014 album song of songs. Every song on the album was inspired by the Old Testament Song of Songs, and it included music by composers David Lang, Luciano Berio, and Betty Olivero. The pieces were performed for the first time at a Louth Contemporary Music Society concert in Drogheda, Ireland, on October 24, 2014. The recording of \\"Just (After Song of Songs)\\" was a collaboration between the Norwegian vocal group Trio Mediaeval, violinist Garth Knox, cellist Agnes V√®sterman, percussionist Sylvain Lem√™tre, and harpist Cliona Doris. In 2014, film director Paolo Sorrentino asked David Lang to create a soundtrack for his comedy-drama movie, Youth. Lang decided to include his previous song, \\"Just (Song After Songs),\\" in the movie soundtrack. In the context of the movie, The Independent called the song \\"a wonderfully intimate work of subtle sensuality.\\"  Themes  The Old Testament Song of Songs is known for its focus on the passionate love between a man and a woman. Lang uses only language found in the Song of Songs, in order to emphasize the intimacy of this kind of relationship. Lang has stated that he uses the relationship between man and woman as a metaphor for the relationship between man and God.  Style  The song is written in a simple, repetitive style, with every line starting with either \\"just your,\\" \\"and my,\\" or \\"our.\\" These are meant to represent the different voices (male and female) found in the Song of Songs. Any line that is structured as \\"just your [blank]\\" represents the male voice, \\"and my [blank]\\" represents the female voice, and \\"our [blank]\\" represents shared ownership.  Reception  The song has received wide praise from a variety of news sources and music critics. Andy Gill, of The Independent, summarized the song as consisting of \\"descending close-harmonies listing lovers‚Äô qualities in an hypnotic, incantatory manner.\\" Chris Voss, of Classical Boston Radio, called the piece \\"simple but compelling.\\" Fiona Maddocks, of The Guardian, called the piece \\"bewitching and incantatory.\\" The song has also been performed and recorded by other musical groups, most notably the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in 2018. The song was sampled by multiple prominent musical artists, including American singer Mike Posner and British indie pop band the xx.

Definition  Let T : X ‚Üí Y be a linear operator between two TVSs. We say that T is almost open if for any neighborhood U of 0 in X, the closure of T(U) in Y is a neighborhood of the origin. Note that some authors call T is almost open if for any neighborhood U of 0 in X, the closure of T(U) in T(X) (rather than in Y) is a neighborhood of the origin; this article will not consider this definition. If T : X ‚Üí Y is a bijective linear operator, then T is almost open if and only if T‚àí1 is almost continuous.  Properties  Note that if a linear operator T : X ‚Üí Y is almost open then because T(X) is a vector subspace of Y that contains a neighborhood of 0 in Y, T : X ‚Üí Y is necessarily surjective. For this reason many authors require surjectivity as part of the definition of \\"almost open\\".  Open mapping theorems  :Theorem: If is a complete pseudometrizable TVS, is a Hausdorff TVS, and is a closed and almost open linear surjection, then is an open map. :Theorem: If is a surjective linear operator from a locally convex space onto a barrelled space then is almost open. :Theorem: If is a surjective linear operator from a TVS onto a Baire space then is almost open. :Theorem: Suppose is a continuous linear operator from a complete pseudometrizable TVS into a Hausdorff TVS .

Biography  Poulleau was born 22 December 1885 in Nolay in C√¥te-d'Or, France, and died 20 November 1960 in Nolay. Her parents were Jean S√©bastien Poulleau and Marie Maurice. In 1913 and 1914 she studied in Paris to become a \\"professor of letters,\\" and during the First World War, she worked as a nurse at the Temporary Hospital No. 71, housed in the premises of the former school, Lyc√©e Carnot in Dijon. During her time there, Poulleau created an album of photographs showing people and events that took place during her service there. The album is preserved as a historical document at the Dijon municipal library. In 1919, Poulleau was offered a teaching post in Alexandria, Egypt, and she took that opportunity to travel to Damascus, Syria, where she founded a college for young girls. She was living in Damascus during the Syrian people's revolt against French control; she later wrote \\"riots broke out in Syria, which were very harshly suppressed by the French army.\\" During her years there, she wrote two books: In Damascus under the bombs (1926), which was banned by French authorities for distribution in countries, like Syria, under French mandate, and Seven stories from Syria (1927). Returning to Nolay, France, she worked on the family estate, which she managed with her father. On 14 October 1933, Poulleau married Georges Guibon (1886‚Äì1981), who was also a French geographer and traveler. The couple went together to the Middle East and also made several stays in the Antilles and Australia.

The bill, numbered NJ S. 2323, requires a co- prescription of an opioid overdose agent, such as naloxone, with prescriptions for opioid medications for patients who have a high risk of overdosing and tightens restrictions on the dispensing of opioid medications in New Jersey.  Background  Since the late 1990s the United States has experienced an opiate abuse and addiction epidemic. The epidemic‚Äôs genesis was the over- prescription of opioid pain medication such as Oxycontin. From 1999 to 2017, more than 399,000 people died from drug overdoses that involved prescription and illicit opioids. The number one cause of accidental death in the United States is drug overdose. Within that statistic, opioids are the most common drug. Legislation requiring the co-prescription of opioid reversal medication with opioids is a state-based public health measure, and there are laws and pending legislation requiring co-prescription in several states. Naloxone is a pharmaceutical drug, available by prescription only, that reverses an opioid overdose quickly. Opiate drugs suppress the body‚Äôs respiratory system, and overdoses are fatal when they stop someone‚Äôs breathing. Naloxone restores normal respiration in an overdose victim.  Legislation  Overall, the legislation is designed to reduce harm from opioid prescription drugs. The mandate for a naloxone prescription is one part of the bill; the bill requires medical practitioners to issue an annual prescription for an opioid overdose product (one example is naloxone, in any of the forms approved by the FDA such as injection or nasal spray) to certain patients. These patients include anyone:https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/S2500/2323_I1.PDF * Whose daily opioid prescription is higher than 50 morphine milligram equivalents * Who has a history of substance use disorder * Who also has a prescription for a benzodiazepine drug (such as Xanax) at the same time that they have an opioid prescription Additionally, the bill tightens restrictions on the prescribing of opioids. First, clinicians prescribing an initial opioid prescription to a patient are limited to a 5-day supply. Second, clinicians must follow new requirements before issuing an initial prescription for an opioid which include taking a thorough medical history, doing a physical exam, developing a treatment plan (that includes addressing the cause of the pain), discuss with the patient the risks of addiction to the opioid drug, and enter the patient into a pain management program. The bill gives an exception to these new rules for patients being treated for cancer or who are in hospice care.  Legislative action  The legislation was introduced in the 219th Legislature session of the New Jersey State Senate on April 9, 2020 by State Senator Vin Gopal. It was referred to the Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee. Gopal is the youngest member of New Jersey‚Äôs state Senate. Gopal has introduced other bills to help combat the opioid crisis. For example, he sponsored S. 52 which requires the Commissioner of Health to create a local team in each county to review drug overdose fatalities.
