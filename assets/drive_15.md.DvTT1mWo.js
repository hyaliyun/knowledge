Administratively it is under the Sangole Taluka of Solapur District in Maharashtra. The village is known for its export quality anar (pomegranates). 90% of its population is directly or indirectly dependent on pomegranate production. Hence annual income is very high. The village is located 15 km by road west of the town of Sangole, and 8 km by road east of the village of Bombewadi and the bridge over the Man River.The Man River is a right (west) tributary of the Bhima River with its mouth at . Location Ajanale is a village in the hot and arid zone of Solapur. The blazing sun and rocky land characterize the landscape of this region. Aside from thorny bushes and that occasional yellow desert flower there is very little that meets the eye on the plains that forms Solapur. Ajanale is one of the most progressive villages in Solapur, especially known for its pomegranates. History The gram panchayat of the village Ajanale was established in 1951. Until 1972, the villagers were largely shepherds. Their main income came from an employment guarantee scheme implemented by the government. In 1972, this village was selected for the development scheme entitled ‚ÄòKrushi Pandhari‚Äô. Under this scheme, certain select villages were given aid in agriculture by helping them conserve water. This was especially needed in a drought prone region like Solapur. Under this scheme, Ajanale saw the construction of several bunds and percolation tanks. \\"Paani Adwaa, Paani Jirava\\" (stop water, help water percolate) was the slogan to promote percolation of water in this dry region. This started the process of raising the water tables in this region. In 1997, the village received the Adarsha Gaav Puraskar (Ideal Village Award). The criteria for the award were: an addiction free environment, clean village with appropriate water facilities for drinking as well as other uses, availability of basic primary health care facilities, implementation of most applicable government schemes, sophisticated farming practices, among others. There are no rivers in Ajanale. There are some tributary streams that flow south to the Man River, but these only have water during the monsoon season. Percolation tanks provide some water, but not enough to ensure the survival and quality fruiting of pomegranate trees using traditional irrigation techniques. The water table remains as low as 500 ‚Äì 550 feet, due to ground water pumping from bore wells dug in several places. However, the introduction of the efficient technology of drip irrigation changed the scope of farmers' cultivation. Farmers began experimenting with pomegranate installed drip irrigation systems in the early 1980s. Between 1984 and 94, 50% of the farming population started cultivating pomegranates. Today every family that has land cultivates pomegranates. Those without land work as labourers in pomegranate orchards. So the entire village is dependent on the pomegranate for their livelihood. In short, pomegranates and adequate water management has led this village to prosperity. Economy Ajanale has a farming economy, traditional crops include Pomegranate, Jawar. Farmers rely on rain water for farming needs. Pomegranates and effective water management has made the farmers of Ajanale very rich. Each has a house in his own farm. Although water to the household is less, there is always water on the farm. The yield of pomegranates is very high. The quality too is superior. This is the reason why now they do not have to send their produce elsewhere, but the markets themselves come here. They get excellent rates for their produce from the comforts of their own farm house. In fact, marketing of pomegranate has become such a good business that several youth in the village have entered it. They not only produce pomegranates but also deal with markets outside and sell produce from several farmers in the village to urban markets. As business grows so does the employment opportunity within the village. Hence, landed and landless, alike, are rising up the socio-economic ladder gradually but definitively. A few farmers from this village were invited to make a presentation on development of horticulture at the World Bank conference held in Pune in 2010. And the farmers agree that prosperity is possible only because of effective water management and the drip irrigation systems. It is important to have SCIENTIFIC/ Geological approach for solving the water problem in the area. The topographic feature is suitable for implementation of Integrated Watershed Development Programme. Rain water harvesting is less in area. The dry or failed bore wells can be used as 'RECHARGE SHAFTS' where roof water can be collected in these dry bores which will help recharging deeper water zones. The upper zones of water is limited to about 280 feet, but farmers take deeper bore wells that causes leakage of upper zone water into lower dry red bed 'geru' zones. If farmers collectively decide to not to exceed this depth, it will solve the problem to some extent and save their money that usually goes waste in taking deeper bore wells, costly/ high Hp pumps & the heavy cost on electricity bills. Demographics In the 2001 India census, the village of Ajanale had 3,331 inhabitants, with 1,701 or 51.1% male and 1,630 or 48.9% female. The sex-ratio was 958 females per thousand males. In the 2011 census, the village of Ajanale had 4,173 inhabitants. Administration Ajanale has a village gram panchayat for day- to-day administration. The gram panchayat for the village Ajanale was established in 1951. Ajanale has co-operative banks, agricultural credit societies, non-agricultural credit societies and other credit societies are present within the village. Education Facilities Ajanale has two primary schools and one higher-secondary school within the village. There is also a government funded childcare and mother-care center (Anganwadi) within the village as part of the Integrated Child Development Services program started by the Indian government to combat child hunger and malnutrition in 1975. Transport  Rail  Ajanale has no railway station of its own, the closest railway station is Sangole. Road Ajanale is connected by the State Transport Buses that ply between Sangole and Atpadi.

She was a daughter of Katsia-Giorgi Dadiani, a member of the princely house of Mingrelia. Darajan married Heraclius in 1750 and their marriage lasted 48 years until his death in 1798; the union produced 23 children. In the final years of her husband's reign, Darejan exerted significant influence on politics and court affairs. She was skeptical of the pro-Russian policies of Heraclius II and his successor, her step-son, George XII, whose progeny she tried to prevent from succeeding to the throne of Georgia. After the Russian annexation of Georgia, Queen Dowager Darejan was deported to Russia proper in 1803. She died in St. Petersburg at the age of 69 and was buried at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.  Early life and marriage  Darejan was a daughter of Prince Katsia-Giorgi Dadiani, a younger son of Bezhan Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia in western Georgia. She was only 12 years old in 1750, when Heraclius, then reigning in Kakheti, chose her as his third wife, a year after his second wife, Princess Ana Abashidze, died. The marriage was negotiated on Heraclius's behalf by his relative, Princess Khoreshan, daughter of the late King of Kartli Jesse and wife of Prince Jesse Amilakhvari. The bride was brought by Khoreshan and Saba, Bishop of Ninotsminda, to Surami, where Heraclius met her. The wedding was then lavishly celebrated at the court of Heraclius's father, Teimuraz II, King of Kartli, in Tbilisi. In 1762, Heraclius of Kakheti succeeded on his father's death as king of Kartli, thus uniting both eastern Georgian kingdoms into a single state.  Issue of succession  The couple's first better documented child, Princess Elene, was born in 1753, followed by 22 more between 1755 and 1782. As her sons grew up, Darejan's desire to secure the right of succession for her offspring against Heraclius's eldest surviving son of his second marriage to Anna Abashidze, the Crown Prince George, became the cornerstone of Darejan's involvement in the politics of Georgia. In the last years of Heraclius II's life, she became more involved and influential. In 1791, Darejan persuaded her husband to overturn the principle of primogeniture in favor of fraternal inheritance, mandating in his will that after his death, his eldest son George would become king, but that after George's death, the throne would pass to the next surviving son of Heraclius, rather than to George's offspring. The surviving sons of Heraclius and Darejan‚ÄîIulon, Vakhtang, Mirian, Alexander, and Parnaoz‚Äîthus, emerged in the line of succession. After Heraclius's death in 1798, the now King George XII, reneged on the will of the late king, declaring it invalid on account of it being forced upon his father. This occasioned a further breakdown in already strained relations between George XII and Darejan and his half-brothers.  Relations with Russia  Another conflicting issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's relations with the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians to their own devices in the face of a disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia. Darejan and her party were resolutely opposed to George XII's renewed quest for the Russian protection. In 1800, one of Darejan's sons, Alexander, openly broke with his half-brother and attempted a coup with the help of his Avar and Iranian allies. The relations in the royal family hit the nadir in July 1800, when George XII forced Queen Dowager Darejan into confinement at her palace in Avlabari, prompting Darejan's sons to mobilize their loyal forces around Tbilisi.  Downfall and exile  Remnants of Queen Darejan's palace in Tbilisi. After the death of George XII in December 1800, the Russian general Ivan Lazarev issued the Tsar Paul I's order to all the members of the royal family, beginning with Darejan, forbidding the nomination of any heir to the throne. After Paul's death in March 1801, Darejan applied to the new tsar, Alexander I, to confirm her eldest son, Iulon, as the new king and protect her and her kin from harassment from George XII's heir Prince David and his supporters. However, the Russian government proceeded with the outright annexation of the Georgian kingdom, bringing the millennium of the Bagratid rule in Georgia to an end. The Queen Dowager and her sons withdrew into opposition to the new regime; Iulon, Alexander, and Parnaoz were now in open rebellion. Darejan's every trip outside Tbilisi was closely watched by the Russian military. Eventually, Tsar Alexander ordered the commander in Georgia, General Karl Knorring, to deport all members of the royal family from Georgia for resettlement in Russia proper on 20 August 1802. The State Council confirmed the decision and instructed Knorring to \\"strengthen all measures for the transport of Queen Darejan and other members of the royal family to Russia, because their presence in Georgia will always be a cause and reason [for the development of] parties hostile\\" to the Russian hegemony. Darejan's relations with Knorring were particularly tense. Once, the general angered her by wearing his hat and coat at her house and interrupting an interview at noon, declaring it was time for his vodka. The task of deportation was to be fulfilled by Knorring's successor, General Pavel Tsitsianov, himself of Georgian origin. In vain Darejan cited her illness to avoid exile. Tsitsianov responded that no reason would postpone her departure. She was further accused of \\"treasonous\\" correspondence with Russia's enemies and removing the venerated icon of Ancha from a church in Tbilisi. The Russian military had Darejan escorted on 25 October 1803 out of the estate of her grandson in Mukhrani to her exile in Russia. Darejan, known to the Russians as the tsaritsa Darya Georgyevna, was allowed to settle down in St. Petersburg, where she lived in a rented house in the parish of the Church of St. Simon and Anna. Later, the ailing queen was permitted to have a house church, which was consecrated on 22 July 1804 and closed following the death of Darejan on 8 November 1807. Darejan, Queen Dowager of Georgia and Lady of the Russian Order of St. Catherine, Grand Cross, was buried at the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

It was first established by the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR in 1937 to replace the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine and was elected for the first time on December 27, 1938, at the first session of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR. The presidium later became the permanent body of the Post-Soviet legislature of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada, and was discontinued upon the adaption of the Constitution of Ukraine on June 28, 1996. Background According to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR, the presidium was elected by the Supreme Soviet from among the people's deputies, at the first session of each following convocation for the entire term of the Supreme Soviet; however, when a new convocation of the Supreme Soviet was elected, the outgoing Presidium retained its powers until a new presidium was elected. The presidium was competent to issue and resolutions and possessed the right of legislative initiative in the Supreme Soviet, and was, in effect, the Ukrainian SSR's collective Head of State. The Constitution also required more detailed provisions regarding the legal status, competence, order of formation and activity of the Presidium to be defined by the standing orders of the Supreme Soviet. After 1991, the powers of the Presidium have narrowed. Some authority was delegated to the newly created post of the President of Ukraine, while more authority was transferred away to the Verkhovna Rada. Composition The Presidium was initially composed of chairman, two vice-chairmen, a secretary and 15 ordinary members. Following the adoption of the 1978 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR, the number of vice-chairmen was increased to three and the number of ordinary members became 20. Powers At the adoption of the 1978 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR, the presidium had the powers to: * Call elections for the Supreme Soviet and local soviets and elections of district and city courts * Convene sessions of the Supreme Soviet * Coordinate the activities of the Supreme Soviet's permanent commissions * Exercise Control over the activities of local councils (soviets) * Monitor observance of the Constitution * Interpret republican laws * Override decisions and regulations of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR and of local soviets in case of their inconsistency with the law * Resolve issues concerning the administrative-territorial system * Establish and change borders of regions and their raions (districts) * Establish and award honorary titles of the Ukrainian SSR, including an honorary diploma and a Diploma of the Presidium * Grant citizenship of the Ukrainian SSR * Solve issues concerning of granting asylum, including issuing acts of amnesty and granting pardons to citizens convicted by courts of the Ukrainian SSR * Ratify and denounce international treaties of the Ukrainian SSR * Appoint and recall diplomatic representatives of the Ukrainian SSR in foreign countries and international organizations * Receive letters of credence and recall of accredited to it diplomatic representatives of foreign countries * If necessary, between sessions of the Supreme Soviet, Amend the laws of the Ukrainian SSR, subject to subsequent approval by the Supreme Soviet * Create and liquidate ministries and state committees on the proposal of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR * Appoint and dismiss ministers and state commissioners on the proposal of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers List of chairmen Chairmen of the Presidium (distinct office) * July 27, 1938 - July 28, 1939 -- Leonid Korniets * July 28, 1939 - January 15, 1954 -- Mykhailo Hrechukha * January 15, 1954 - April 7, 1969 -- Demyan Korotchenko * June 19, 1969 - June 9, 1972 -- Oleksandr Lyashko * July 28, 1972 - June 24, 1976 -- Ivan Hrushetsky * June 24, 1976 - November 22, 1984 -- Oleksiy Vatchenko * March 27, 1985 - May 15, 1990 -- Valentyna Shevchenko Chairmen of the Presidium (ex officio as Speakers of the Rada) * June 4, 1990 - July 9, 1990 -- Volodymyr Ivashko * July 23, 1990 - December 5, 1991 -- Leonid Kravchuk * December 5, 1991 - May 11, 1994 -- Ivan Plyushch * May 11, 1994 - June 28, 1996 -- Oleksandr Moroz See also * Presidium of the Supreme Soviet * Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Further reading * Bezpalyi, I.

It was amended by the Holidays (Transfer of Public Holidays) Amendment Act 2008 and the Holidays Amendment Act 2010. This page includes those changes.  Principles underpinning the Holidays Act  New Zealand law on holidays and leave has been based on three key concepts: # For the purposes of rest and recreation, all employees are entitled to enjoy four weeks‚Äô paid annual holidays (or ‚Äúannual leave‚Äù) each year. # Public holidays are for the observance of days of national, religious, or cultural significance, which all employees should be entitled to take as leave, where possible. Where it is necessary for an employee to work on a public holiday that work should be specially rewarded. # The employment relationship is both financial and human. Therefore, after a period of employment, it is reasonable to expect that employers will support employees with sick leave and bereavement leave when required. The Holidays Act 2003 reinforces these principles by attempting to balance fairness between employers and employees, and recognising that, in some areas, existing arrangements may meet these principles.  Public Holidays  After the introduction of the Employment Contracts Act in 1991, some workers in New Zealand without strong union representation lost either their right to have a day paid off on a public holiday or a day in lieu. Furthermore, if they did work a public holiday, a lot of employees lost any right for a day in lieu or penal rates for working these holidays. This Act makes it compulsory for all employers to give their permanent employees either a paid day off work, or a day in lieu on all public holidays. Also, if the employer requires an employee to work on a public holiday, the Act requires the employee to not only get a paid day in lieu, but to also be paid at the rate of time and a half for working that day.  Annual Holidays  As stated above, the Act increased the annual leave for an employee from 3 weeks, to 4 weeks. However the Act delayed the implementation of this section until 1 April 2007.  Sick Leave  The Act states that an employee does not need to supply a medical certificate if the employee is away from work for 3 calendar days or less. This removes any unfairness in requiring an employee to supply a costly medical certificate when taking a short time off work. However, the Act states 3 calendar days, and not work days, so even taking off just 1 day off work, and that is either a Friday or a Monday, technically would require a medical certificate. Furthermore, the Act was later amended that an employer can still request a medical certificate if they have reasonable grounds the employee is not sick, and that the employer agrees to reimburse the employee for the cost of obtaining the medical certificate. The Holidays Act describes sick leave entitlement in days and does not provide for smaller units. If an employee works part of a day and then takes the remainder of the day off as sick leave, then the whole day is counted as sick leave. Despite this, and employer and employee may agree to use hours or part days, as long as the employee is better off as a result.  Sick Leave and Holiday pay rate  The Act also rectified employers underpaying employees for sick days and holidays, particularly in jobs where part of the employee‚Äôs pay was bonus or performance pay. For instance, if an employee got paid $100 a day, plus $200 a day bonus, the employer could have paid the employee $100 for a sick day, and not $300 as they would have expected of earned for that day. The Act now requires an employee to be paid what they would have expected to earn had they worked that day. Typically, this is calculated to the person‚Äôs average daily pay for the last 12 months. However the Act can be unfair in several circumstances. A common example is where an employee, having worked a five-day week, is also paid to be on standby during the weekend. In this case their Average Daily Payhttp://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0129/latest/DLM3635918.html will be significantly lower than if the employee was not paid to be on standby. This is because the standby allowance is typically small (a small increase in the numerator), but the number of workdays increases significantly as a result of weekends being included (a large increase in the denominator). It is not always clear whether an employer should pay Relevant Daily Payhttp://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0129/latest/DLM236856.html or Average Daily Payhttp://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0129/latest/DLM3635918.html when an employee takes sick leave. The decision can make a major difference to an employee's pay. In 2012 New Zealand Post was found to have incorrectly paid employees Relevant Daily Pay based on their staff's rostered hours, rather than Average Daily Pay, which also takes into account occasional unrostered overtime that an employee might have worked, had they not been absent.http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7881652/NZ-Post-may-appeal- postie-pay-win This resulted in NZ Post making back payments to staff of nearly $12 million.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=11265431 Payroll software typically calculates payments for employees on the basis of an hourly rate and the number of hours worked. The fact that the Holidays Act specifies daily rates for some leave types (as above) and weekly rates for annual leavehttp://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0129/latest/DLM236884.html makes calculations for leave payments problematic and error prone, especially for employees who work an irregular number of hours each day. The law firm Simpson Grierson,Simpson Grierson is leading a working group that is striving for changes to make the Holidays Act simpler to apply.

Fujita (ed.), Deep-sea fauna and pollutants off Pacific coast of northern Japan. National Museum of Nature and Science Monographs 39: 225-383.Natural History Museum, London (NHM): Collections Management Database System Description The size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 50 mm. (Original description by Watson) The high shell is concavely conical. It is carinated, sculptured on the upper whorls, and smooth or wrinkled below. It is thin, with a tumid lirated base. It is narrowly umbilicated, with a smooth epidermis, thin, but especially so on the base. The shell is more or less nacreous all over under a thin porcellanous upper layer. Sculpture: The first three whorls (after the embryonic apex) are reticulated by three sharp remote spirals, and rather stronger, slightly oblique longitudinals, which rise at their intersection into small sharp pyramidal tubercles. The interstices are a little broader than high. This system gradually dies out and leaves the surface smooth, only the row of infrasutural tubercles survives in an enlarged but depressed form. And springing from these some sinuous oblique and slightly irregular longitudinal puckerings appear on the body whorl, which is nearly bisected by the sharpish, slightly expressed, finely tubercled carina. This bisection of the body whorl arises from the great prolongation and tumidity of the base On this base, below the carina, are five narrow, equally parted, spiral threads, and two intra-umbilical ones, which are more contiguous. Besides this larger system of sculpture, the whole surface is covered with minute, oblique, irregular, and interrupted puckerings of the epidermis. Colour: Theshell has a brownish yellow colour, but below the epidermis there is a thin pure white porcellanous layer, through which and the epidermis the sheen of the nacreous layer gleams. The base is whiter, the epidermis there being very thin. Inside, the aperture shows an exquisite roseate nacre. The spire is high, with a slightly concave contour, the lines of which are hardly swollen out by the slight tumidity of the body whorl. The apex is eroded, but evidently small. The shell contains 7 or 8 whorls, of regular increase, quite flat, except the last, which is very slightly constricted below the suture, a very little tumid on the upper slope, sharply carinated but not much angulated at the suture, and very tumid on the base. The suture is linear, strongly defined above by the square furrow lying between the lines of tubercles which marginate the suture above and below. On the body whorl it becomes slightly pouting, from the projection of the carina and the slight infrasutural constriction. The nearly square aperture is very little oblique in the line of its advance, but standing out a little obliquely to the axis of the shell. The outer lip is thin, not descending. The columellar lip is thin, spread out broadly at its base over the umbilicus, which it largely conceals, with a deep narrow furrow behind it. It advances thin and pointed, curving over to the right to its angular junction with the basal lip. The umbilicus is defined by a spiral thread and with two other spirals within it. It is not so much small as concealed by the columellar lip. Watson R. B. (1878-1883). Mollusca of H. M. S. Challenger Expedition.

Under the system, wealthy citizens chosen for military service by lot could pay a sum of money, originally enough to pay someone else to serve in their place, instead of being made to join the military themselves. It was abolished in Belgium in 1913 and replaced by a system of service militaire personnel (\\"personal military service\\"): a form of universal conscription. History Policy The Belgian army relied on both voluntary enlistment and, from 1902, also on recruitment by lot in order to keep its numbers constant. Both the Liberals and Catholics advocated Remplacement as a way of privileging the aristocratic and bourgeois classes and were united in defending it against reformers. Abolition The Belgian response to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1 highlighted the inadequacies of the country's military to defend its borders. The system of remplacement was viewed as an anachronism, constituting an unfair privilege for the wealthy and reducing the quality of the army's recruits. King Leopold II was particularly keen that the system be abolished and used his political influence to try to persuade politicians to support reform. Major-General Guillaume, Minister of War and a former aide de camp to the king, pushed for the government to adopt a policy of personal military service, and resigned from the cabinet on 10 December 1872 when it would not.Albert Duchesne, \\"Guillaume (Gustave)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 38 (Brussels, 1973), 289-293. With both major political factions united in favour of Remplacement, and only the Belgian Workers' Party in favour, reform was delayed. The system was finally abolished in 1909, to be replaced by system whereby one son per family would be eligible for conscription into the army. In 1913, Albert I finally managed to have a bill passed through parliament instituting compulsory conscription for all adult males over the age of 20.

One of the fascinations of Puelma was the Eastern world and exotic lands. \\"The Merchant Pearl\\" is a fine example of this. The work now hangs in the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts and is one of Puelma's best known works. Valenzuela Puelma showed a talent and interest in art from an early age. At the age of twelve, he began attending the Academy of Fine Arts where he learned from Ernesto Kirchbach and Juan Mochi. For the first few years he combined artistic training with the study of medicine. Between 1881 and 1885 he was awarded a scholarship from the Chilean Government to continue his art studies at the workshop of Benjamin Constant in Paris. He also took courses in anatomy at the Sorbonne, where he made contact with movements that would go on to revolutionise art history, like the Manet School. However, it was the work of the Spanish masters that he copied at the Louvre that made the deepest impression on him, and were more of an influence on his style. In 1887, for the second time, he won a scholarship to study in Paris this time attended the workshop of Jean Paul Laurens. Whilst studying in France and upon his return to Chile, he submitted his works to be included in most art galleries and art contests in Santiago, and won awards on several occasions. During the last decade of the 19th century, when living in Valpara√≠so, he played an active role as an administrator at the Theater La Victoria, as well as managing art exhibitions. Valenzuela Puelma made his final trip to France in 1907 and never returned to Chile. He was suffering from persistent depression and mental illness that left him destitute and led ultimately to his death at the age of 53. His remains were later repatriated to Chile and honored at a grand ceremony held in the main hall of the National Museum of Fine Arts. Although Valenzuela Puelma was not formally dedicated to teaching, his students included the painters Alfredo Helsby and Eucarpio Espinosa, among others, which is why critic and historian Antonio Romera includes him in the group of the Great Masters of Chilean painting.Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma Biography in Spanish www.portaldeart.cl Retrieved 5 April 2013 Style \\"La lecci√≥n de geograf√≠a\\" (Georgraphy Lesson). The painter followed the rules of the Chilean Academy very closely for much of his life. Several historians have described him as a perfect example of the Academy's formal style, although Puelma liked to paint scenes of everyday life, as can be seen in this work. Valenzuela Puelma successfully developed a realist technique based on the canon of academic art. Throughout his productive career, he worked using oils and painted a very diverse range of subjects, such as landscapes, interiors, portraits, still lifes and especially nudes.

Design and development The IS-3 was designed as a high performance sailplane for record-breaking and international competition flying. The development of the IS-3 was in four distinct phases with differences in wing position and construction as well as fuselage design. The original glider, first flown on 19 August 1953, was built primarily of wood with a pod and boom style fuselage and high-set wings. The streamlined pod contained the enclosed cockpit with flush fitting canopy and supported the wings and the Duralumin sheet tubular tailbboom which supported the conventional tail surfaces at its extremity. The tapered wings were built with plywood-covered torsion box leading edges with fabric covering aft of the main spar, incorporating spoilers for approach control and differential ailerons to reduce adverse yaw. With the exception of the IS-3c and IS-3d the IS-3 family followed the pod and boom arrangement with variations in wing position, span, wing construction and undercarriage arrangement. All versions had a single mainwheel with nose and tail skids, varying in skid sizes and mainwheel position. The IS-3c and IS-3d were drastically different in having a conventional wooden fuselage and further minor variations in wing construction and roll controls. Operational history Data from: Romanian Aeronautical Constructions 1905-1974 ;IS-3:The IS-3 set several national records, at a 1954 international gliding contest at Leszno in Poland and at other times: :*Speed - over a straight line with reference point, piloted by Mircea Finescu at Lesno. :*Distance - straight line with reference point, piloted by Mircea Finescu at Leszno. :*Speed - over a triangular circuit, piloted by Mircea Finescu at Leszno. :*Speed - over a with reference point, piloted by Ovidiu Popa. :*Distance (women) - straight line between Ia»ôi and Cuza VodƒÉ, CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi, piloted by Aurelia Ro≈üianu-Gheorghiu. ;IS-3d:The IS-3d set several national records: :*Speed - over a triangular circuit, piloted by Ovidiu Popa. :*Speed - over a with reference point, piloted by Gheorghe Gilc«é. :*Speed (women) - over a triangular circuit, piloted by Aurelia Ro≈üianu-Gheorghiu. Variants Data from: Romanian Aeronautical Constructions 1905-1974 ;IS-3:Original prototype with high-set span wings on a pod and boom fuselage, with two part differential ailerons and non-speed-limiting airbrakes/spoilers. ;IS-3a:A revised IS-3 with wings lowered to the mid position and tailboom also lowered. The IS-3a wings were similar to the plywood D-box and fabric covered aft section of the IS-3 but incorporated flaps with two part differential ailerons and non-speed-limiting airbrakes/spoilers. ;IS-3b:The IS-3b was essentially identical to the IS-3a with the exception of having no flaps and having plywood skinned wings throughout. ;IS-3c:The IS-3c was markedly different from its predecessors in having high-set span wings, skinned throughout with plywood, with three section differential ailerons and introducing speed- limiting airbrakes. The new long span wing was supported by a conventional fuselage, incorporating the streamlined enclosed cockpit and a conventional tail unit. ;IS-3d:Essentially similar to the IS-3c, but with a wing, single- section ailerons and streamlined wing-tip fairings and speed limiting airbrakes. ;IS-3e:Reverting to the pod and boom layout the IS-3e had high-set span wings, with plywood D-box and fabric covered aft section, two section ailerons and speed limiting airbrakes. ;IS-3f:A variant with a wing completely skinned with plywood, otherwise similar to the IS-3e.

Main characters Mordecai Mordecai (voiced by J. G. Quintel) is a 23-year-old anthropomorphic blue jay who works as a groundskeeper at The Park. He has been best friends with Rigby ever since childhood, and together they are very lazy and constantly slack off at their jobs there. Mordecai is more conscientious, intelligent, mature, and moral about his actions than Rigby is, which sometimes leads to his opposing Rigby when he is the cause of some kind of chaotic problem. However, Mordecai usually sides with his friend and the two generally stick together through their adventures. Mordecai loves to play video games and is a better player than Rigby, he also demonstrates decent strength, such as carrying large boulders, and never being hurt by Rigby's punches, able to punch Rigby across an entire room with ease. He can sometimes become caught up in his emotions, often letting them get the better of him. However, he is usually quick to apologize to others if he has hurt them and occasionally takes the lead in fixing a situation. He had a crush on Margaret Smith, a red robin who worked as a waitress at a local coffee shop. Mordecai would often hang out with her, along with Rigby and Eileen Roberts, and made many attempts to try to start a relationship with her. The two finally begin to date in the fourth season until Margaret decides to leave for college, thus ending their relationship. Mordecai meets CJ shortly afterwards and they start dating. CJ and Mordecai's relationship is strained due to CJ seeing Mordecai and Margaret having fun together on several occasions. He eventually decides to take a break from dating in \\"Dumped at the Altar\\", after his relationship with CJ didn't work out. In the episode \\"Camping Can Be Cool\\", it is revealed that he attended art school before being employed at The Park; however, he did not finish school due to his bad portrait skills, which were revealed in the episode \\"Bad Portrait\\". He is shown to have an outgoing mom, who embarrasses him around his girlfriends and also made a highlight reel of Mordecai's most embarrassing moments, as seen in \\"Maxin' and Relaxin'\\". In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", Mordecai quits The Park, parts ways with Rigby, moves to New York City, and returns to making art. He opens a successful exhibition and meets a bat woman whom he eventually marries and starts a family. Mordecai's wife was not given a name in the show. Head writer Matt Price, on Reddit, gave her the name Stef when asked about it,{{cite webauthor=Price, Matturl=https://www.reddit.com/r/regularshow/comments/5oszo6/we_are_matt_price_head_writer_and_calvin_wong/dclulg5/title=One: we never named Mordecai's wife.

JG loves Goonies so I'm going to say her name is Stef.publisher=Redditaccessdate=2019-11-13 and writer Owen Dennis stated on Tumblr that there had not been previous plans to give a name to the character. Rigby Rigby (voiced by William Salyers) is a 23-year-old anthropomorphic brown raccoon who works as a groundskeeper at The Park. He has been best friends with Mordecai since childhood and slacks off even more than Mordecai does. Rigby is hyperactive, immature, and extremely mischievous, which sometimes puts him at odds with Mordecai. He mostly lives for simply having a good time and relaxing, which he sometimes achieves through selfish acts like lying or cheating. He has a bad habit of getting himself and others in trouble, often causing many of the chaotic and surreal problems that arise in The Park. Nevertheless, he is shown to be a good person deep down and sticks closely to his friends. Like Mordecai, Rigby loves to play video games, but he is the worse of the two. He is also shown to be the weakest of The Park workers, although he has surprised them on a few occasions. Rigby's lack of strength was a major plot point in the episode \\"One Pull Up\\", in which Rigby had to pass a company physical and keep his job by performing one pull up. He has a younger brother named \\"Don\\", whose height and physique lead people to believe that he, not Rigby, is the older brother. Eileen Roberts, a female mole who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret Smith, has strong feelings for Rigby and makes this very obvious. He originally did not reciprocate her feelings and harshly ignored her at some points, but he quickly begins to warm up to her and implies that he likes her, as well. In \\"Dumped at the Altar\\", Rigby reveals to Mordecai that he and Eileen have been dating for 3 months. Rigby is allergic to eggs, as evidenced in the episode \\"Eggscellent\\" when Rigby tried to eat a 12-egg omelet to win a trucker hat and went into a coma due to a severe allergic reaction. Rigby has also died four times and was resurrected in the series. He was killed by Skips in an arm wrestling match, he was killed by Snowballs the Ice Monster, he was killed by Mordecai who pushed him into the Space-Time Continuum, and fell into a fatal coma in \\"Eggscellent\\". As of Rigby's Graduation Day Special, Rigby has finally graduated from high school. In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", Rigby quits The Park and moves in with Eileen. They eventually get married and start a family, but it's unknown if Rigby is working or not as he is seen teaching his children how to play video games. It is hinted at in the episode \\"'Ello Gov'nor\\" that Rigby's last name may be Riggerson, however, this has neither been confirmed nor denied by J.G. Quintel. Benson Benson Dunwoody (voiced by Sam Marin) is a gumball machine who works as the manager of The Park. He is frequently infuriated with Mordecai and Rigby due to their constant slacking and mischief. He is very hot-tempered and prone to fits of rage, and bossy often turning red (or pink if injured) whenever he yells or is extremely angry, his catchphrases are \\"You're fired!\\", \\"_____ or you're fired!\\", or even \\"Get back to work!\\". At the end of some episodes, Benson tries to fire the duo (sometimes along with their coworkers or only one of them), but they always manage to find a way to keep their jobs with some help from other characters. Even so, they may instead have to face consequences whether it is their fault or not. Despite always being at odds with them, Benson is kind-natured at heart and is ultimately friends with the duo after calming down a bit in the episode \\"Benson Be Gone\\" and the three gain more insight and trust with each other as the series progresses. In the episode \\"Think Positive\\", it is revealed that Benson's family members often yelled at each other when he was a child. His father instructed him that he would not get anything in his life if he did not yell for it. If Benson ever contained his anger for too long, the anger inside him will cause havoc and destruction unless he expresses his anger by yelling (often at Mordecai and Rigby). It has been implied that Benson was unhappy during his youth and did not enjoy his family's anger. He is skilled at stick hockey and has a strong love for music, proving to be an extremely skilled drummer in the episode \\"150 Piece Kit\\". Benson used to date Audrey, a human woman who lives across from him in his apartment complex. It is revealed that they broke up in \\"The Real Thomas\\", in which Benson starts to date an undercover Russian spy named Natalia, although she is later eaten by a whale. In the episode \\"Pam I Am \\", Benson develops feelings for one of the dome scientists named Pam and they go on a 'date'. However, Dr. Langer witnesses the 'date' and makes a new rule that forbids the dome staff from dating anyone who works at the park. At the end of the episode, it is implied that Benson and Pam will date once the dome is gone. During the beginning of the episode \\"Fries Night\\", Benson contacts Pam back on earth, to which she revealed that having a \\"long distance\\" relationship with Benson because he is now in space is too difficult for her. She states that the reason for the break up is that she doesn't know when or if he will ever return to earth again. They both agree to become friends even though Benson later gets depressed from yet another break up with a woman he really cared for. In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", Benson remains working as the manager of The Park and gets back together with Pam. They apparently adopt Apple Sauce as well as a variety of cats.  \\"Pops\\" Maellard Pops (voiced by Sam Marin) is a cheerful, humble, quirky, and gullible lollipop-shaped man who resides at the house in The Park. His adoptive father, Mr. Maellard, is the owner of The Park. Pops tends to be very ecstatic about everything, often exclaiming \\"Good show!\\" or \\"Jolly good show!\\" when he is happy about something. When something bad happens, he will instead say \\"Bad show.\\" He tends to dress and act like he is in the early 20th century and utilizes technology and slang from circa 1900‚Äì1910. He carries small butterscotch lollipops in his wallet, sincerely believing that they are real money, much to everyone's confusion. He is an upright gentleman who is very kind and well-mannered to everyone. He is also very sensitive, often becoming upset or crying if his feelings are hurt. He has strong interests in poetry, wrestling, music, nature, animals, and games. Despite being an elderly man, he is very childish and is often oblivious to serious things around him. Because of this, the group frequently looks after him, especially Benson. Pops has also been shown to have immense strength on several occasions, despite his slim build. In the episode \\"Prank Callers\\", it is shown that Pops was once a more serious and mature man back in the 1980s. However, when Mordecai and Rigby had been sent back to that time and accidentally hit him with a golf cart, he is shown to have turned into his zany self. Pops once owned a British doll named Percival, or Percy, who turned his back on him and tried to kill Pops in \\"Terror Tales of the Park\\". Pops is also one with nature, but lost it until he tries to find the answer to get it back, as shown in \\"Catching the Wave\\". In Season 8, Pops is revealed to be the universe's Chosen One due to being born with telekinetic abilities and ever since he is one with nature back in some previous season's episode, as well as having an evil version of himself with the ability to erase a person from existence. Pops' destiny is to kill Malum Kranus to prevent the destruction of the universe. In \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", it is revealed that his real name is Mega Kranus. Pops also realizes that the best way to defeat Malum Kranus is with kindness. Pops gives Malum Kranus a hug and the two fly into the sun, killing them both in the process, and the universe is saved. In Heaven, Pops' is heard saying his catchphrase 'Jolly Good Show' as a video tape of the show, and the show itself, ends. Skips Skips (formerly Walks) Quippenger (voiced by Mark Hamill) is a yeti who works as a groundskeeper at The Park. He is the strongest and smartest of The Park workers and they almost always turn to him for help, as he usually knows how to solve the chaotic problems that arise, however, he isn't always right. Whenever he is asked for help, he generally says, \\"I've seen this before\\", and then presents a solution. As his name suggests, he is always skipping rather than walking, except when he is angered, in which he runs instead. He is a diligent worker and is very skilled at his job; however, he suffers from a lack of knowledge of computers and other kinds of newer technology, which was seen in the episode \\"Skips vs. Technology\\" where Rigby and Mordecai jam a printer and crash the computer whilst printing a card for Skips thanking him for his efforts to save them for being fired from Benson for their antics. Aside from this, he is very experienced and knowledgeable, as he is immortal and has been alive for hundreds of years. In the episode \\"Free Cake\\", it is revealed that he must perform a ceremonial dance every year on his birthday in order to renew his immortality. He explains the story of how he received his immortality in the episode \\"Skips' Story.\\" He chose to become immortal in order to fight Klorgbane, an immortal bully who inadvertently caused the death of his girlfriend, Mona, the only woman that Skips had ever loved during a fistfight. The Guardians of Eternal Youth provided Skips with his immortality, knowing that he was the only one capable of defeating Klorgbane with the Fists of Justice. Skips' birth name was Walks, but he changed it to Skips when he received his immortality because he and Mona would always skip when they were together. This is also the reason why he always skips instead of walking; he chose to do this in order to remember the times he and Mona shared for all his life. Skips is also a skilled bassist, which is demonstrated in several episodes. In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", Skips remains working at The Park while having a new part-time job as a mechanic, satisfied with his life. Muscle Man/Mitch Sorenstein Mitchell \\"Muscle Man\\" Sorenstein (voiced by Sam Marin) is an obese and green-skinned man who works as a groundskeeper at the Park. He is very erratic and immature, often pulling pranks and joking around. He enjoys telling \\"My mom!\\" jokes, botched attempts at \\"Yo mama\\" jokes, much to the annoyance of everyone except Hi-Five Ghost, his best friend. Although he can be rude due to his ego, he is ultimately shown to be polite and caring toward his friends. He and Fives were fired in the episodes \\"Don\\" and \\"Under the Hood\\" but were rehired at the end. At times, he can burst out on a rampage if he is greatly angered. His father, Muscle Dad, enjoyed the same attitude for pranks and jokes, but died in the episode \\"Trucker Hall of Fame\\". His older brother, Muscle Bro (real name John), is also seen throughout the series. Muscle Man originally shared a rivalry with Mordecai and Rigby throughout the first two seasons, but the three began to get along and treat each other as friends from the third season onward. His girlfriend, Starla, shares a similar appearance to him and the couple constantly disgust other people when they publicly kiss and show affection to each other. His real name was revealed to be Mitch Sorenstein in the episode \\"Muscle Woman\\". In \\"Power Tower\\", it is revealed that he gained the nickname \\"Muscle Man\\" from his early years of bodybuilding and actually being in excellent physical condition, but he found that life very boring and gave it up. In \\"The End of Muscle Man\\", he proposes to Starla and the two become engaged and they are now married in \\"Dumped at the Altar\\". In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", upon returning home Muscle Man discovers he has a three-year-old daughter. He and Starla live out their days in their trailer park home and have numerous children. It was revealed in \\"Trailer Trashed\\" that the trailer was his prize for winning a hot dog eating contest. Hi- Five Ghost Hi-Five Ghost (voiced by Jeff Bennett in season one, then by J. G. Quintel from season two onward) is a ghost with a hand extending from the top of his head who works as a groundskeeper at The Park. Hi-Five Ghost is best friends with Muscle Man and frequently gives him high fives to accompany his jokes, as he genuinely finds most of Muscle Man's jokes amusing. Because of his name and appearance, he is frequently called by his nickname, \\"High Fives\\", and sometimes simply as \\"Fives\\". Hi-Five Ghost rarely speaks throughout the first three seasons of the series, but he is given more dialogue from season four onward. His father was introduced in the episode \\"See You There\\", as well as his older brother, Low-Five Ghost, who works as a police officer. In the episode \\"The Postcard\\", Hi-Five Ghost reunited with a human girl named Celia whom he had befriended at a cafe after waiting four years to receive a postcard from her in Prague. In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", Hi-Five Ghost and Celia become a married DJ duo and tour the world together. They have a child together. Recurring characters Thomas/Nikolai Nikolai (seasons 4‚Äì7) (voiced by Roger Craig Smith) is a young goat who was trained by the KGB as a ruthless spy, and who later sent him to work for the Russian organization M.O.M.M. (Ministry of Meadow Management), a KGB agency that struggled to find out what made American parks up to date and wealthy. In order to fix Russia's outdated parks, M.O.M.M. sent out Nikolai on a covert operation to obtain the park and bring it back to Russia. During his undercover mission, he changed his identity to \\"Thomas\\" and presented himself as an intern for credits in college in \\"Exit 9B\\" (in which he made his debut), working as an unpaid intern who calls his \\"mom\\" on a regular basis and is often reproved by his coworkers, most notably by Muscle Man. He is usually reluctant to be involved in the surreal and chaotic adventures that arise in The Park, often asking if he has to be part of the situation, to which they insist that he must. There are times when Nikolai becomes personally invested in maintaining his cover, such as using a robot to pose as his \\"mom\\" in \\"The Thanksgiving Special\\", and wearing spy attire disguised as a Halloween costume (a slice of pizza, which he had to wear until Thanksgiving Day upon losing a bet in \\"Terror Tales of the Park III\\"). When the other Russian spies that were deployed with him carry out the final phase of the plan to bring The Park to Russia in \\"The Real Thomas\\", he finally reveals his true identity to the park crew and explains why he is really there. When Nikolai learns the plan is really to destroy the Park through a loophole in Russian/American relations, he turns on his fellow spies for being lied to (along with some persuasion by the park crew to remind him of the good times they had as friends, despite the constant poor treatment he received from them for being an intern), and returns the Park to American soil before going on the run from both sides. He makes several cameos after this, usually in some sort of disguise. Eventually, he returns in \\"Guys Night 2\\", revealing himself to be tired of his old life as a spy and wanting to move on to a new life. He feels his only option is to go into hiding forever, but first he enjoys one final hang with the park crew. He made non-speaking cameos in later episodes. In ‚ÄúRigby‚Äôs Graduation Special‚Äù, he makes a brief cameo by proposing a toast to the park dome taking off into space while in his submarine. Margaret Margaret Smith (voiced by Janie Haddad-Tompkins) is a female red robin who was a waitress at a local coffee shop. She was good friends with her co-worker, Eileen. Mordecai had a huge crush on Margaret and frequently found excuses to go to the coffee shop to see her. She has a cousin named John who has an artificial wooden leg. The rest of her family are all birds like her and Mordecai, except for her father Frank, a strong and stern human. Margaret returns Mordecai's feelings for her and the two begin to finally date in the fourth season. They broke up in the season finale when Margaret leaves for college. In the episode \\"Eileen Flat Screen\\", Margaret returns now as a news reporter, which no one notices. In \\"Merry Christmas Mordecai\\", Mordecai becomes nervous when he hears that Margaret will be there. After several awkward encounters (thanks to Mordecai), they finally manage to have a normal conversation with both acknowledging that they had some good times. This leads to a montage of memories, ending with a memory of a kiss on a roller coaster. Unfortunately, when the scene flashes to the present, they accidentally kiss on the lips and are shocked when they notice CJ watching them. CJ runs out of the house and leaves while Mordecai runs upstairs to find his phone; he notices that all of Margaret's stuff is there and Eileen tells him she is staying as an intern. Mordecai is frantic when he hears the news and didn't know what to say about Margaret staying with Eileen from now on. As of \\"Sad Sax\\", Mordecai and Margaret are still just friends, and Mordecai makes it up to CJ by telling her the truth. In \\"1000th Chopper Flight Party\\", Mordecai is still awkward with her presence and afraid to screw up, even to the point of letting Rigby constantly mess up the Party as a diversion just to keep her away from him. When he finally is declared as the lucky guest to ride Chopper 6 for its 1000th flight, he finds it hard to say no and joins. Margaret tries to talk to him, but Mordecai awkwardly resists until she scolds him for his attitude in desire for their friendship. Mordecai then lifts the tension with a joke and they finally start to have a fun chat. This however angers CJ, who misinterprets it as them rekindling their love, and she causes havoc with her storm cloud ability. Mordecai tries to save Margaret, but she calms CJ when she reveals that she is in a relationship with news anchor, Del Hanlon, which stuns Mordecai and surprises her parents. In \\"Not Great Double Date\\", Mordecai seemed upset that Margaret had a boyfriend, but still said that she seemed happy with Del and that he liked him. When she confessed that Del was not her boyfriend and that she was tired of feeling like a tourist around her friends because of the tension with CJ, he felt sad about it and was pretty interested to know that she still had feelings for him. In \\"Just Friends\\", Rigby and Eileen go to the presentation of martial arts Don, leading to Mordecai and Margaret spending a night that has romantic moments. A chef named Daisuke shows them their future using magical sauce. It is revealed that if, and when, Mordecai and Margaret get together, they will get married, have children, buy their own houseboat, and die peacefully after 50 happy years. Mordecai and Margaret agree that their future looks like it will be really great, but that they are still young and should take it easy on relationships. At the end of the episode, the two agree to remain just friends, with future Margaret looking down on them and inquiring how long they can be just friends, and future Mordecai stating that \\"only time will tell.\\" In \\"Rigby's Graduation Special\\", she was very worried as she watched Mordecai and cried as the other park workers being shot into space, even saying his name in concern. However, in the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", she is only seen greeting Eileen when she returns. She does not end up with Mordecai and is not seen with the group 25 years later, though she becomes a muse for Mordecai's art. Head writer Matt Price stated on Reddit that the idea was that Mordecai and Margaret would find their own paths in life On Tumblr writer Owen Dennis stated that reality shows that many people who initially date one another end up with other people, contradicting narrative arcs of many Western entertainment media. Eileen Eileen Roberts (voiced by Minty Lewis, a writer/storyboard artist for the series) is a shy and timid mole who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret. She has a crush on Rigby, but he initially found her annoying. She is notable for her intelligence and displays many skills and hobbies throughout the series including dancing, sewing, and astronomy. One of Eileen's odd personality quirks is her affinity for sea turtles, which is referenced in a few episodes. She first appeared in the episode \\"Brain Eraser.\\" She also appears in the episode \\"Do Me a Solid\\", in which Rigby learns of Eileen's crush on him (even though Rigby shows no interest in Eileen), though he goes along with it for a while. Since the episode \\"Camping Can Be Cool\\", Rigby has warmed up to Eileen. Rigby thought very highly of her and praised her actions throughout the episode. In the episode \\"Diary\\", Rigby admits that he finds Eileen to be attractive when she is not wearing her glasses, but it also reveals that she also can't see without them. In the episode \\"One Pull Up\\", Eileen helps Rigby train for his company physical and he shows his gratitude by hugging her (and crushing her due to his enlarged physique).

Eileen became a main character member in Season 8. In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", she and Rigby move in together and start a family. It is unknown if she has a job or not, but based on her husband's lazy personality, it is implied that she does. Starla Starla \\"Muscle Woman\\" Gutsmandottir-Sorenstein (voiced by Courtenay Taylor) is an obese green woman similar in appearance to Muscle Man. She works at Icy & Hot Jewelry & Apparel. In the episode \\"Muscle Woman\\", she developed a crush on Mordecai and had previously dated two other people as indicated by a tattoo on her lower back. When Mordecai broke up with her, she became extremely angry, destroying everything in her path, including a helicopter. She got back together with Muscle Man after he expressed his feelings towards her at the end of the episode. Since then, Starla has appeared with Muscle Man in various episodes, including \\"Fancy Restaurant\\", \\"Pie Contest\\" and \\"Bald Spot\\". In the episode \\"The End of Muscle Man\\", Muscle Man proposes to Starla and the two become engaged. In the episode \\"Dumped at the Altar\\", she marries Muscle Man. In the epilogue to \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\", Starla is revealed to have had a daughter with him, during the crew's three-year absence. She and Muscle Man live happily in their home and had more children over the years. Starla is one of the only characters who refers to Muscle Man by his real name, Mitch. CJ Cloudy-Jay \\"CJ\\" (voiced by Linda Cardellini) is a cloud humanoid. She had been Mordecai's girlfriend with reoccurring anger problems. She first appeared in the episode \\"Yes Dude Yes\\", in which Mordecai started dating her after thinking Margaret was engaged. After learning that Margaret was not getting married, he almost immediately forgets about CJ, leading to an ugly break up at the coffee shop in which she revealed that she can transform into a deadly storm when really angry and assumed this form in three episodes. After Margaret leaves town for college, CJ and Mordecai meet each other at the New Year's Eve dance in the episode \\"New Year's Kiss\\", unwittingly kissing each other at midnight. The following episode, \\"Dodge This\\", continues this story days after the kiss with CJ and Mordecai competing against each other in a dodgeball tournament. This leads to awkwardness between the two in the final round of the dodgeball tournament and they are forced to address their issues before the Intergalactic Dodgeball Council.

Mr. Maellard Mr. Maellard (voiced by David Ogden Stiers) is an elderly lollipop man who owns The Park and is also Pops' adoptive father. He first appeared in the episode \\"Dizzy\\". Maellard is very impatient towards Benson (similar to Benson's impatience towards Mordecai and Rigby) and Maellard blames Mordecai and Rigby's shenanigans on Benson (as he expects Benson to take responsibility for Mordecai and Rigby as park manager). He purposely mistakes Benson's name a lot in some of the episodes in which he appears (using \\"Ballbucket\\", \\"Beanbag\\", etc.). Maellard finally got Benson's name right (and started to respect him more as well) in the episode \\"Benson Be Gone\\" due to Benson's coming to his rescue when he was captured by Susan (a woman whom Mr. Maellard had hired as the park manager after demoting Benson and is later revealed to be a demon) and also gave Benson his old job back. As the series progresses, he turns into quite an eccentric character. He sends the gang to space in the final season and in the episode \\"The Ice Tape\\", Pops and the gang find out that Maellard is not his real father but Maellard found him as baby and adopted him during an expedition and kept him safe until the time was right for Pops to fulfill his destiny but Maellard tells Pops that no matter what he always thought of him as his real son. In the series finale, when the park gang returns from space after a three-year absence, Mordecai notices Maellard staring up at the sky, shedding a tear for his son.

Quintel, William Salyers, Sam Marin, Mark Hamill, and Roger Craig Smith) are a group of four ducks whom Mordecai and Rigby found in a fountain in the park in the episode \\"A Bunch of Baby Ducks\\". They have shown their ability to fuse together to form a giant, anthropomorphic, duck-like creature when they fist-pump simultaneously. They return in the episode \\"A Bunch of Full-Grown Geese\\" to help Mordecai and Rigby rid the park of the evil, titular geese who soon turn into a giant monster. The duo helped the baby ducks upgrade their giant form and succeeded in defeating the geese. They also appeared in \\"Exit 9B\\" where they helped fight the park worker's past villains in their giant form. Before their official debut, an unrelated group of baby ducks are some of the things sent to the moon by Rigby in the episode \\"The Power\\". In \\"Brilliant Century Duck Special\\", they again help the park gang fight the geese, who are now helping businessmen that are attempting to destroy the park. In the series finale, they help the Park gang fight Anti-Pops and Streaming. Guardians of Eternal Youth The Guardians of Eternal Youth (voiced by David Kaye, Robin Atkin Downes, Roger L. Jackson, J.

Quintel, and Troy Baker) are a group of five infant-like beings for whom Skips must perform a ceremonial dance in order to maintain his immortality otherwise, he will be stripped of his eternal life. Skips also attended school with them before they granted him his immortality. They also designed and built Skips' Fists of Justice, which allowed him to defeat Klorgbane the Destroyer (their evil brother) in the episodes \\"Fists of Justice\\" and \\"Skips' Story\\" and they seem to like cake. Mordecai and Rigby found out about this and because they accidentally injured Skips, they took over and defeated Klorgbane (but not before he killed Archibald, one of the guardians), who vowed to return before he was sent flying away.

He is the king of his home planet Synthos, but left to travel the galaxy and his half-brother David took over. When he found out how strict David is as king of Synthos, he battled him in a music battle and won.

Despite these evil intentions, he also helped the groundskeepers defeat the villains resurrected by GBF Jr. in the episode \\"Exit 9B\\". Death also has a son named Thomas, a 300-year-old demon (voiced by Michael Dorn) who can speak, although Death does not know this. He later helped them retrieve Mr. Maellard's guitar in \\"Guitar of Rock\\", and in \\"The End of Muscle Man\\" where the others think he's trying to take Muscle Man's soul, but was only there to deliver him a ring. He also makes an appearance in the episode \\"Cheer Up Pops\\" after the gang invites him to a party to help them cheer Pops up. In this episode, he said that they could count on him to help in the final battle. In the series finale, he helps the park gang fight Anti- Pops and Streaming. Don Donald \\"Don\\" (voiced by Julian Dean) is Rigby's younger brother. Introduced in the episode \\"Don\\", Don is better and more likeable than Rigby in most ways, though as a child he was trying to be as cool as Rigby, unknowingly causing Rigby to be extremely jealous. Don is also significantly taller than Rigby and loves to give hugs to other people. Don expresses this by asking his comrades for \\"sugar,\\" which is customarily his catchphrase. At the end of the episode, the two reconcile as Rigby apologizes to Don on his jealousy towards him, while Don apologizes for not knowing of Rigby's annoyance towards him. Don returned in the episode \\"Bank Shot\\", where he helped Rigby practice for a bet he made with someone.

When that does not go according to plan, he uses his powers to instantly grant both of them great basketball powers. The God of Basketball momentarily changes sides when he is forced to play with Muscle Man against the duo for computer rights for life. The God of Basketball also appeared when he helped Rigby to get back his hat, in the match of Rigby vs. a basketball net face-like weirdo in 'Bank Shot'. The God of Basketball later appears in \\"Exit 9B\\" as a protagonist Skips summons to help save The Park.

Despite his attempts to steal the stomach, the duo stop him and manage to save the sensei. Dr. Reuben Langer Dr. Reuben Langer (voiced by Troy Baker) was the new leader of the Dome project who first appeared in \\"The Button\\".

He hired thousands of people to help him with his business, but no-one ever thanked him in return because they spent time with their families. So he planned to use the golden wishbone to have Thanksgiving to himself, and receive the thanks that he always wanted. Mordecai and Rigby wouldn't let him get away with it, so there was a quarrel between the three (with help from their friends) on Richard's blimp until they are kicked out of the blimp by Richard, who didn't know they had swapped the wishbone with the spoons Rigby used for their performance. Richard realized he had been tricked, and he was killed when his blimp was destroyed after it crashed into a bridge. The duo then use the wishbone to return to the park safely. The F.E.

Radio\\". After being activated, it turns rogue and forces everyone out except Donny G, who is forced to work as a janitor. When Muscle Man tries to get the song he wrote for Starla on the radio, the computer wouldn't let him do so, as playing the tape will activate its self- destruct program. He, Mordecai, and Rigby are able to convince Donny G to help stop the computer, but it soon discovers what they are up to. Despite its attempts to stop them (wounding Donny G in the process), it is defeated when Donny G plays Muscle Man's tape and causing the radio station to explode while the trio escape (although Donny G had somehow survived it).

Benson bought his products to keep Mordecai and Rigby from slacking off, but they manage to constantly evade him, causing Benson to accidentally summon him to the park to watch over everybody and as a result, he cannot leave until they die (due to the contract that Benson signed without even reading it). After spooking everyone with his gazes, Mordecai challenges him to a staring contest in which Peeps must leave if Mordecai wins, but if Peeps wins, he will harvest their eyes. However, Peeps cheats using numerous eyes but Rigby cheats back using a laser light that causes him to lose the staring contest, setting him on fire and crashing into the lake. He is blinded in the process, and is last seen taken to the hospital. Hot Dogs The Hot Dogs (voiced by Tim Curry, J. G. Quintel, Sam Marin, Mark Hamill, and William Salyers) are the main villains of \\"Meat your Maker\\".

He is one of the villains resurrected by GBF Jr. in \\"Exit 9B\\".  Blonde Men  The blonde men (leader is voiced by Mark Hamill, the rest are voiced by William Salyers and Roger Craig Smith) are a secret cult of identical men with blonde hair, some of which wear rings that fire lasers. They are the main villains in \\"Bet to Be Blonde\\".

Rigby cheats to win, but later regrets it and feels ashamed when Mordecai (wearing a blonde wig) makes friends with blonde men and joins the group, who take Rigby hostage and force him to be turned into a blonde in the end. At that point, Rigby confesses to cheating on the bet to Mordecai, who frees him. Mordecai then reveals his wig to the blondes, which prompts them to attempt to kill the two. As Mordecai and Rigby escape, Mordecai sets his ring to self-destruct before the two evacuate the building, killing the blondes in the explosion. The blonde men were among the resurrected villains in \\"Exit 9B\\"; eventually, those who survived the battle were sent back to the portal.

The Carlocks give chase to try and get the camera back, but the four manage to escape the hole. Skips' truck then dumped dirt into the hole, killing them for good. The Carlocks also appear in the online game \\"Fist Punch 2\\" as enemies. Were-Skunk The Were Skunk (voiced by Paul F. Tompkins) is a mythical creature and the villain in \\"Skunked\\", where he sprayed Rigby. As Rigby began a slow evolution into a Were-Skunk himself, he hunted down the skunk in exchange for learning how to stop the process. The skunk however, does not tell Rigby the truth, as he wants Rigby to suffer the same fate that he has. After a brief fight breaks out between the two, Mordecai, who has learned that tomato paste can stop the process, intervenes and blasts both Rigby and the skunk with a can of tomato paste, which turns them both back to normal. The skunk is revealed in his true form to be a normal man, who thanks Mordecai and Rigby for helping him return to normal, before passing out.

Realizing what had happened, they use the prize car to escape while fighting Night Owl's henchmen, who attempt to get them back in their glass case. When attempting to escape to the past using a time machine, the Night Owl (who is now a head inside an owl robot which kept him alive for many years) tries to stop them but fails, allowing them to get to the past and stop him from starting the contest. The robot version of Night Owl returns in \\"Exit 9B\\" as one of the villains resurrected by GBF Jr., only to be sent back to the portal of afterlife.

The Urge later travels back in time to kill Rigby for making him lose his fame after he changed his name. \\"Trash Boat\\" escapes with Mordecai and heads to the courthouse, where he officially changes his name back to \\"Rigby\\". When everything is back to normal, the Urge does not try to kill Rigby anymore.

He eventually steals them and is pursued by the duo and the ducks' mother. After the mother duck is knocked unconscious during the fight, the Collector tries to kill Rigby using a military sword. Enraged, the Baby Ducks defend their surrogate father by turning into a Duck Man. They then chopped the Collector in two, killing him instantly.

When the manager refuses to refund them even though Mordecai and Rigby have a receipt, the duo manages to sabotage his business until he does. The angry manager eventually traps them in the game and becomes the knight Darthon. When he almost defeats them, the duo realize that players control the game by using their imagination. They finally win when Mordecai stabs Darthon with an immunity sword, and the three re-appear in the real world, in which the manager was really impaled by a ruler. Although the duo enjoy the game and decline the refund, the manager gives their money back and drives away before Mordecai and Rigby could help him. He supposedly died, as his Darthon version was one of the revived villains in \\"Exit 9B\\". However, he later makes a cameo in \\"That's My Television\\". Ybgir Ybgir (vocal effects provided by Roger Craig Smith) is Rigby's negative counterpart who appears in \\"Jinx\\". Ybgir first appears as a demon in \\"Jinx\\" after Rigby tries to break his jinx.

When Rigby screws up the school's chance to win the state volleyball championship, Ross plans an elaborate revenge plot to make a time machine to win the championship, and get revenge on Rigby. It is revealed that the reason why Rigby messes up Mr. Ross' school volleyball team from winning the match, was originally meant to teach his bully, Jablonski a lesson, as Ross was not aware of Jablonski's bullying nature. When Rigby tells his younger-self not to repeat his past mistake for unintentionally turning Mr. Ross into a villain, even Mordecai changes sides in the future without telling his reason why he ruined Mr. Ross' game, the younger Mr. Ross is relieved to hear the younger Rigby's apologies and his reasons for this before being sent to jail, retconning the fate of Mr. Ross and Mordecai's future. He is seen in the same cell as Doug Shablowski when the park is suddenly sent to space. Halloween Villains =Percy= Percy (voiced by William Salyers) is the name of a Victorian Doll that Pops had owned ever since he was a child. He had the ability to talk and spoke with a deep voice, which is very strange, considering that his appearance is that of a cherubic, really young British boy. He was the most sophisticated doll of his day, with 250 phrases stored inside. Yet the only real phrases we heard him say had to do with an obsessive desire to draw on peoples' faces. Percy not only spoke of his obsession, but it was discovered that he was also an autonomous, \\"living doll\\" who actually carried out his intentions and threats of drawing on peoples' faces. He drew on Pops's face after Pops tried to throw him away, and when Pops tried playing teatime with him after Mordecai and Rigby threw him away, Percy became aggressive and wanted to draw on Pops's face even more. Mordecai and Rigby tried to rescue Pops, but Percy escaped and went into the basement. When Mordecai, Rigby, and Pops went after him, Percy knocked Mordecai and Rigby unconscious with a shovel. Percy demanded Pops to bring him a marker so he could draw on Mordecai and Rigby's faces, but then Pops stood up for himself and told Percy that it's not cool for a grown man like him to play with dolls and that Percy must go away. Percy then ran towards Pops to attack him, while Pops did the same. Pops kicked him into the furnace, where he started to melt. He then climbed back out of the furnace in one last attempt to draw on their faces, but instead ended up collapsing onto the floor. =Skull Punch= Skull Punch is the name of a supposedly British heavy metal band that had died and returned as ghosts, living in an old looking RV in The Park. After Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost decided to crash their RV into a crash pit they had made two weeks ago, the ghosts captured them and planned to leave them inside of the RV when it exploded in the crash pit. They are one of the only people that died twice on Regular Show. They performed a rock song while the RV was going into the crash pit, but failed to jump off before it went into the hole, and they died again. The names of each band member (as revealed during the credits) are Harold (lead singer and guitarist) (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes), Nigel (bassist) (voiced by Sam Marin), and Archie (drummer) (voiced by Julian Holloway). All three band members were only seen in \\"Terror Tales of the Park\\", being in one of the shorts: \\"Death Metal Crash Pit\\". The Skull Punch are revived by Garrett Bobby Ferguson Jr. in \\"Exit 9B\\", despite that they appeared only in a horror story that may not have happened. But they were eventually sent back to the portal. =Halloween Wizard= The Halloween Wizard (voiced by Mark Hamill) first appears in \\"Terror of the Park\\". He lives inside of a large, supposedly haunted mansion, which was egged by Rigby due to him turning off the light and not responding when being asked by Rigby to give him candy. This led him to seek revenge on Rigby. He later lurked around Pops's House and used his dark magic to turn Rigby into a nice- looking house. Later that night when it was dark, Muscle Man was on the porch and then saw him driving his car to the front of the house and comes out invisible. Muscle Man tells him to change Rigby back and to get out of there, as well as loading his shotgun telling him not to ask twice. The Halloween Wizard then teases him and asks Muscle Man if he has any clever jokes about his mom, Muscle Man tells him not to talk about his mom so he starts firing in random directions, to no avail. Everyone else watches him shooting the gun but Muscle Man gets knocked over. The wizard then drags him across the grass, yelling and holding his gun up in the air while being dragged and fires the gun a few more times before he goes into the woods. Mordecai, shocked, asks if they saw that. Then there is a knocking on the door, which opens and reveals Muscle Man, who has had his skin ripped off, showing only muscle (inferring that the Wizard had skinned him). Muscle Man says, \\"I told you I was ripped\\", then falls over and dies after that and scares the others then the phone rings. Hi-Five Ghost goes to answer it, after Skips tells him not to, and answers the phone saying, \\"Hello?\\". The wizard then says \\"Good-bye!\\" and sucks him into the phone and turns him into liquid that squirts onto Mordecai and Skips. Mordecai is then knocked unconscious when the wizard throws him against the bookshelf. Benson and Pops see this and they both scream and run into different rooms. Then the wizard breaks Skips' crossbow and the wizard throws Skips into the chimney and burns him. Then he goes to the bathroom and pulls back the curtains for the shower and finds Benson and says, \\"What's up Gumball?\\". Benson then screams and gets flushed down the toilet. Then, Pops is on the bed terrified and the wizard comes in and Pops fires a rock at the wizard with his slingshot but misses and the wizard picks him up, drags him on the ceiling, and puts him in the closet which falls over, then disappears. Rigby is scared and asks if anyone was there. Mordecai then wakes up and tells him that he won't let anything happen to him, but the wizard decapitates him. Then, Rigby finds out that Mordecai has died and he says sorry to the wizard. Then the wizard comes and gives Rigby his punishment by throwing eggs at him. Then Rigby becomes angry because the wizard turned him into a house and killed everyone so he can egg him. The wizard then drowns him in a giant raw egg. It is then revealed that it was just a story that Rigby told. Muscle Man then makes fun of his story saying that it was weak and that his story about wrecking cars in a pit was way better. But Rigby says that \\"that's not it\\" and turns out to be the wizard who disguised himself as Rigby. Everyone else is freaked out and screams as the wizard finishes the episode by saying, \\"Happy Halloween!\\" The Halloween Wizard also appears in an online game \\"Fist Punch 2\\". =Party Bus Driver= The Party Bus Driver (voiced by Mark Hamill) is a mummy with purple sunglasses who appeared in \\"Terror Tales of the Park II\\" as the main antagonist of the short, \\"Party Bus\\". Mordecai, Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen agreed to take a ride in the party bus but after realizing that they get older while the bus moves forward, they attempt to escape. After being threatened by Mordecai to stop the bus, his bandages fly off, revealing him to be a skeleton and he makes the bus go faster, causing the gang to age quicker. He was pulled out of the driver's seat by Mordecai, causing him to fly backwards and break into pieces. Mordecai then puts the bus in reverse causing them to get younger. After the four escape the bus through a roof hatch, they, along with the driver and the bus, disintegrate and the story ends. =Jan the Wallpaper Man= Jan the Wallpaper Man (or simply known as Jan or The Wallpaper Man) (voiced by Andrew Daly) is the main antagonist in \\"Terror Tales of the Park II's Wallpaper Man story. At first glance, he is but a simple, middle-aged, worker for hire guy, but in reality, he uses his wallpapering skills as an opportunity to feed himself. His true form is a giant, evil, predator tarantula. He can spin silk that looks like red and black wallpaper. He cocooned Pops and the gang but they are saved by Mordecai and Rigby. He was killed at the end of the story by Muscle Man's grenades, taking the duo with him. =Johnny Allenwrench= Johnny Allenwrech (voiced by William Salyers) appeared in Terror Tales of the Park III as the main antagonist of the short \\"Killer Bed\\". He was the spirit of a serial killer that got trapped into a bed. Rigby buys a bed from a company called UM√ÑK, not realizing that Johnny's body is in the box. After talking to Mordecai in the kitchen he brings the bed into his bedroom to assemble together, Rigby tries to assemble the bed by himself, but fails through attempting for four hours, afterwards he gets Skips to help build the bed which was completed by seven hours. After assembling the bed, Rigby lays down on the bed and finds it very comfortable. He then turns on the television and eventually tunes in to a live news channel where the news reporter asks a question, \\"Did you buy a bed recently?\\" Rigby replies by saying \\"Yes\\", the news reporter says this may have been a fatal mistake, he then explains during a shootout with police at a UM√ÑK factory, Johnny Allenwrench, a potential murderer fell into a UM√ÑK machine where he was manufactured into a bed. The reporter then goes on to say due to a clearing error, the bed was shipped out to stores, and now the company is reclaiming the KILL√úRGEN beds back. Rigby then says that he feels sorry for \\"the loser who brought that bed\\", but after finding out his new bed was made by the same company, he claims he's also \\"one of those losers\\". Eventually, the news reporter receives the code for the bed that contains the murderer. He then reads the code out saying: \\"If you have this bed code number you are sleeping on a murderer, 623570406 the last number is smudged he grabs his glasses and says it is an 8\\". The bed then molds and captures Rigby within it. The bed then threatens Rigby with a hex key, however Benson tells him that he'll give him a job if he lets Rigby free. The next day, Johnny is shown watering some flowers when he suddenly attacked by the groundskeepers who cut him down into a few pieces of wood. The scene then opens out, to show Benson and Rigby, who were watching the whole thing. Benson congratulates Rigby on planning the ambush, whilst Rigby congratulates Benson on lying to Johnny's face. =Scarecrow= The Scarecrow (voiced by Mark Hamill) is a character who appears in \\"Terror Tales of the Park III\\" as the main antagonist in \\"Jacked-Up Jack-o-Lantern\\".

He then proceeds to touch everybody, which turns them all into pumpkins before squishing them and eventually planting their seeds in the pumpkin patch so that their heads grow into pumpkins. By the end of the episode, he laughs while they all argue on who should go home with a mother and her son, knowing that he had avenged his wife. =Jebediah Townhouse= Jebediah Townhouse (voiced by William Salyers) is a minor character in the show. He makes his debut in the episode \\"Terror Tales of the Park III\\". It is said that he lived in the house 200 years ago and was ahead of his time. More so than most others who are considered ahead of their time, since he acted and spoke like it was the 1980s. Since he behaved and talked oddly, the townsfolk thought that he was a wizard, and tried to murder him. Before they could, he put his soul into the house and exclaimed he would show them all and return in 200 years when everyone talked and acted like him, and he would be king of the world. When he realized everyone in his time would be long dead by then, he vowed to come back in the form of a murderous poltergeist to haunt and kill whomever is inside of the house, but before doing so, he signed his house over to Mr. Maellard. Unfortunately for Townhouse, his predicted time of return bypassed the eighties, when he would have been in style. Meaning now, instead of being far too ahead of his time, his mannerisms were considered old fashioned and out of touch. 200 years later on Halloween night, Benson told his fellow park workers the story of Jebediah as well as a scary story about him, which involved Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost trying to escape from him after taking on a dare to survive the whole night in the house but are one by one killed, afterwards proceeding to tell them that he was indeed a real person. Jebediah then finally manifested and scared off everyone in the house and proceeded to wish them a Happy Halloween. =Ghost Mordecai and Ghost Rigby= They are minor villains in \\"Terror Tales of the Park IV\\".

He is on trial for eating a man and the people on jury were the park staff.

It is revealed that Pete (actually named \\"Peter Hermanverfal\\") was one of the many people to be captured by Party Planners and be cloned for parties, meaning that the Party Pete that died was only a clone. The Party Pete Clone made an appearance as one of the resurrected villains in \\"Exit 9B\\".  Hair to the Throne  The Hair to the Throne (voiced by Roger Craig Smith, Mark Hamill, and William Salyers) are a hair metal band. Benson was formerly part of the band, but due to his \\"legendary drum solo\\" performance on their first album, he was fired, for if anyone knew of his role he would achieve the most fame out of the four members. His replacement is the machine known as the \\"Drumatron VI\\". In \\"150 Piece Kit\\", the Hair to the Throne are scheduled to perform a concert at the Park. Benson plans to perform the solo again at the concert, and takes his drum kit to the park, where it is destroyed by the Hair to the Throne but Mordecai and Rigby help him fix and set it up during the concert. During Benson's performance, the Drumatron VI and the other band members attempt to stop him, but he overpowers the Drumatron and finished the performance. Afterwards, the Hair to the Throne apologize to Benson for their past actions, and ask him to rejoin them, which he declines. Wall Buddy Wall Buddy is a wall product who appears in \\"Wall Buddy\\".

He made his ultimate prank by leaving Muscle Man a note after he passed, the note asked Muscle Man to spread his ashes over the Trucker Hall of Fame and said that it was his last wish.

This gets so bad that after almost everyone gets offended Reggie throws a temper tantrum and almost destroys the seven layer dip. After this, Skips suggests that Quips does his routine at a kids show and it works out great. Quips makes his appearance in a few episodes and has inspired a fan base for his famous catchphrase, \\"Zingo!\\" The Cart Hecho En \\"the Alive Golf Cart\\" Mexico (voiced by Toby Jones), is the golf cart Mordecai and Rigby use as their way of transportation. His most distinctive appearance was when Mordecai and Rigby accidentally bring him to life (with soda spilled over his engine) while having to replace him. After doing many activities, Cart dives into sea with fireworks firing from his trunk as a final activity to do before going to the dump. After finding out he was going to stay (due to Benson being unable to afford the new cart thanks to an accounting error), Mordecai and Rigby fished him out, repaired him, and drove him back. After these events, Cart could no longer speak or move by himself. He mistakenly believes that his name is \\"Hecho En Mexico\\" because that's what is written on him (\\"Hecho en Mexico\\" means \\"Made in Mexico\\" in Spanish and is actually meant to indicate where the cart was manufactured). Suit An outfit which is simply called Suit (voiced by Dean Cameron) is a suit-like cybernetic talking exo-suit that Benson wears in \\"Benson's Suit\\". He was created by his father, a tailor, to serve an evil boss like Rich Steve.

The next day, the suit cleaned himself suddenly and appeared in front of Benson. He later revealed to Benson who he was and praised Benson as a worthy boss. He then claimed that he would help him to manage slackers like Mordecai and Rigby. When Rich Steve found him, the suit and Benson fought back and defeated Rich Steve. In the end, knowing so many evil bosses are still after him, he tells Benson to \\"wash\\" him in the washing machine in Inferno Mode to destroy him, but before he is \\"washed\\" for the greater good of peaceful kind, they admit that they will never forget their times together. Mona Desdamona, or Mona for short (voiced by Grey DeLisle), was Skips' girlfriend who knew him in the 19th century under his former name Walks. She appeared in \\"Diary\\", \\"Exit 9B\\", and had a major role in \\"Skips' Story\\".

When Rigby was in high school, he was expelled and his mother had to come pick him up. She was upset and tells him that \\"You're always making so much trouble for yourself\\". Whenever Sherm yells, makes fun of Rigby, or talks to Don, Barbara sometimes defends Rigby. In \\"Rigby Goes to the Prom\\" Rigby manages to maneuver Sherm's car to the bottom of a mountain after Sherm lost control while driving and nearly went over a cliff. Afterwards, he appeared to have more respect for Rigby. However, unknown to his parents, Rigby has more experiences involving a more dangerous situations he was in to survive than Don, until they finally acknowledged him, particularly on their older son's graduation speech about that situation he was in. As they were heading to the party, they saw the park going up into space and worriedly watch their older son go up. Stef Stef is a bat woman who appears in the finale.

He was a landscape painter and left an estimated 1,000 paintings. Highlights of his work include paintings of the snow-topped mountains in France and views of Paris. Valenzuela Llanos was a pupil of the Chilean artists Cosme San Mart√≠n and Juan Mochi, both directors of the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts in Santiago, Chile, with Mochi having the greatest influence on Valenzuela Llanos‚Äô work. He was also taught by the Chilean romantic painter Onofre Jarpa. Biography , in the city of Talca, Chile Paisaje de Lo Contador (Lo Contador Landscape, Chile) Valenzuela Llanos was born in the province of Colchagua, Chile, in the city of San Fernando. He was the son of a formerly wealthy family in decline - his parents, Florencia Valenzuela Llanos and Ricardo Lira, were cousins who belonged to a family with a long landowning and military tradition, where intermarriage was common. No explicit records remain to explain why the family was gradually falling into poverty. In his youth, Valenzuela Llanos was always interested in nature and enjoyed strolling through the grounds and admiring the countryside. He often made sketches of trees and colours and was known as respectable young gentleman. He studied at public school and went to high school at a liceo (a public high school specialising in sciences and humanities). As the financial situation of his family got steadily worse, the young Alberto decided to work in the local textile store. He felt trapped in that environment but tried to accept his fate, knowing his family situation. At the age of 17, bored during a quiet day at the shop, he started drawing lilies on a piece of fabric. The store owner saw the drawings and, annoyed but impressed, showed the ruined fabric to the boy's father. His father was amazed at Alberto's talent and decided that the boy was born to be an artist. He managed to convince his brother to let his son live in his house in the Chilean capital, Santiago so he could study simultaneously at the Instituto Nacional General Jos√© Miguel Carrera and the Chilean Academy of Fine Arts. Luckily for Alberto, the new director of the Academy was Juan Mochi, who, unlike previous Academy directors, tried to encourage his students to develop a unique style and did not care if they used unconventional artistic techniques. This enabled Llanos to dedicate the rest of life and career to painting the subject he loved most: landscapes. Valenzuela Llanos produced textured, subtle and simple landscapes using pinks and greens. His paintings of the spring are a faithful record of the morning light. The size of his canvases is particularly notable and is well above the average for the period. Experience of financial difficulties taught him to produce many paintings in a short time, so his work ended up being widely distributed around Chile. He liked to portray landscapes of everyday life in the capital city and began with Lo Contador (now street in Providencia), the mountains of the Caj√≥n del Maipo to the south of Santiago, and the coast of Algarrobo. The personality of Valenzuela Llanos was calm and serene and his main hobby was painting with oils. He never felt influenced by the bohemian atmosphere of the time, keeping his distance from political conflicts, and was always concerned about the welfare of his parents, siblings and friends in his hometown, taking the train to Colchagua whenever he had the chance to visit his relatives. His painting evolved quickly thanks to the direction of Mochi and he began specialising in oil painting and using more and more sketches, drawing designs before starting on the painting itself. Most importantly, he was able to develop a personal style, the product of need and of effort. This earned him early recognition, and in 1889 he gained a place in the ‚ÄúSalon official de Santiago‚Äù (the official Santiago salon or exhibition hall). The following year he won a bronze medal at the annual salon contest, with more awards and recognition following quickly afterwards: in 1890, one of his paintings was featured in the Salon de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, something that few Latin American artists had achieved. Then, in 1891, he won an award at an exhibition in the United States and the Chilean government gave him a scholarship to study in Paris in exchange for some years of teaching . With no hesitation, Valenzuela Llanos accepted the scholarship and went to France to study with Jean-Paul Laurens, who had taught other Chilean painters such as Alberto Orrego Luco and Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma, in the Acad√©mie Julian. There, he learned about impressionism and expressionism and had an extremely productive period, producing many paintings of Paris at dawn. In 1913, his efforts would win him an award at the Salon de peinture et de sculpture in 1913. Thanks to the support of the Chilean government, Valenzuela Llanos was able to travel regularly throughout Europe between 1901 and 1906, giving him the chance to visit Spain, Italy and England as well as France, where he continued to study. Finally, in 1906, he returned home to Chile and was hired to teach drawing at the high school in Santiago. In 1910, he married Julia Montero, a young student. After that he was hired to succeed Fernando Alvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza as professor of painting at the School of Fine Arts, where he taught for a couple of years. Pintura en el campo chileno por Valenzuela Llanos (Chilean countryside) Valenzuela Llanos taught his students in the same way he was taught himself, trying to encourage them to develop their own style. He was beloved by his students and pushed them to walk around Santiago and visit the most famous places. He died in Santiago on July 23, 1925. Currently, most of his paintings are in private collections, but some of his most famous works are in the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts, the Central Bank of Chile, the and the in Talca.

The church was formerly known as Wheeleys Meeting House (as well as once called Wheeley's Church and Upper South Hico Church). The church and its cemetery sit at a small rural area along North Carolina Highway 49 known to locals simply as Wheelers in Gordonton in Bushy Fork Township. The west northwestern part of the cemetery is the oldest and contains many unmarked graves. The original baptist congregation was formed in 1755. In the early part of the 19th century, many Baptists sought to separate from the Calvinist aspect of their theologist that God predestined human beings to either heaven or hell. Others wanted reforms to have Sunday school, musical instruments and paid ministers. In 1832, the church passed a resolution rejecting the reforms and added 'primitive' to the church name. Depression era photographer Dorothea Lange photographed the church in early July 1939 as part of her project with the Farm Service Administration. Before any photographs were taken, Lange had to receive the permission of the older members of the church. Because of hesitation of several members she did not photograph inside the church. She photographed the church on two occasions. First was on Wednesday, July 5, 1939, she photographed the ladies cleaning the church property. The second was on Sunday, July 9, 1939, where she photographed the congregation as they departed church services. The men departed from the left door and the women on the right door. Lange's work provided a glimpse of religious life in the south in the late 1930s.

At present, the name Fort San Felipe also refers to the area of the present Cavite City where the first historic port town Cavite (also known as Cavite Nuevo then Cavite Puerto) and the Cavite Arsenal (now Naval Base Cavite) were located. It is now part of the San Roque district of Cavite City.Dela Rosa, Joy (2007). \\"About Cavite City\\". Cavite Library and Museum. Retrieved on 2014-10-21. History Illustration of the Port of Cavite from the Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas (1734). Fort San Felipe is the diamond-shaped structure. As early as 1591, Gov. Gomez Perez Dasmari√±as recognized the strategic importance of Cavite Puerto as the gateway to the City of Manila and moved toward its fortification. It was in fact at this isthmus, two decades earlier, that Miguel de Legazpi hid his ships prior to the attack in Manila.\\"Fuerza de San Felipe Neri\\". Muog. Retrieved on 2014-10-21. Construction Constructed between 1609 and 1616, Fort San Felipe is the first military fortress built in the province of Cavite during the time of Governor Juan de Silva. According to a report in 1659 of Governor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara: \\"it was quadrilateral in form, with four corner bastions, and had a perimeter of . It was built to face the Cavite Port and Manila. Furthermore, a cube or platform enough for 10 cannons and named Santa Catalina the Martyr was nearby. Facing San Felipe were the ruins of the casa real which had another low platform for eight cannons. However, it was in bad state and had to be repaired.\\" In August 1663, Governor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara ordered the construction of a platform at the entrance of Fort San Felipe that would handle 10 cannons. After some years, four more platforms followed, each were named after Catholic saints. From 1679 to 1688, the fort was used as a prison for Fernando de Valenzuela, former valido to the Queen Regent Mariana of Austria. Cavite mutiny of 1872 The Cavite Mutiny of 1872 was an uprising of military personnel of the Spanish arsenal in Cavite including Fort San Felipe, on January 20, 1872. Around 200 soldiers and laborers led by Sergeant Francisco La Madrid rose up in the belief that it would elevate a national uprising. The event led to the killing of the governor of the fort but was quickly suppressed on January 22. The government soldiers executed many of the participants and began to crack down on a burgeoning nationalist movement. The uprising also resulted in the unjust implication and the tragic execution by garrote of Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora on February 15, 1872.\\"Fort San Felipe\\".

The Cavite conspiracy On September 12, 1896 at 12:45 p.m., thirteen Filipino patriots were taken to the Plaza de Armas, outside Fort San Felipe, and were executed by musketry. The thirteen were leaders of the foiled uprising planned at the Cavite Arsenal on September 3. After the Spanish authorities learned about the plan from a Filipino dressmaker, they immediately arrested Severino Lapidario, Alfonso de Ocampo and Luis Aguado. The rest were rounded up on September 3 after their names were revealed by De Ocampo after being tortured. The group of heroes is now collectively known as the Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite. Among the revolutionaries captured were musician Juli√°n Felipe (who would compose the Philippine national anthem the following year). Felipe was incarcerated for nine months at Fort San Felipe. Also subsequently released were Pablo and Marcos Jos√©, and Juan Casta√±eda of Imus. American colonial period During the early year of the American occupation, only the fa√ßade, the main entrance with flanking curtain walls, and the two bastions at the ends remain of the old port. The rest were demolished by the Americans during the early 20th century to make way for a naval station. The fort is located inside Naval Base Cavite, which is off limits to the public.

It was originally released in a limited edition of 1000 on the private label L.S.D., which Klaus Dinger created when he failed to find a record label willing to release the album. When Dinger signed to Captain Trip Records in 1995 all copies of the album not yet sold were bought up and sold by CTR, although no more copies of the album were ever pressed. Consequently only 1000 copies of the album exist, and it is one of the rarest Klaus Dinger albums. Background and recording Following the recording of N√©ondian in 1984, Dinger was enormously in debt. He attempted to reform Neu! with Michael Rother in 1985, but the reunion faltered and the new album (eventually released as Neu! 4) was shelved in early 1986. Dinger then began recording demos for a second solo album along the lines of N√©ondian, but was dropped from Virgin Records before the album could be professionally finished (it was eventually released as Blue in 1999). Dinger, severely disillusioned with the music industry, opted to form a new band using younger musicians. The as yet unnamed band performed at a concert in D√ºsseldorf, and then began recording an album at Dinger's studios near Kamperland, Netherlands. They adopted the name \\"Die Engel des Herrn\\" or \\"The Angels of the Lord\\". The band name is sometimes written as \\"Die (b)Engel des Herrn\\", which translates as \\"The Rascals of the Lord\\". Dinger was joined by lead guitarist and violinist Gerhard Michel and drummer Klaus Immig. The album's music is deliberately light and pop-ish, demonstrating Dinger's desire that the band be signed to a major label. There is a prominent use of the mellotron as well as sound recordings throughout the album. After recording was completed in 1989 Dinger began looking for a label which would release the album, but was rejected. In 1990 Dinger's father Heinz died, and Klaus Immig's young son drowned in a lake. By the end of 1991 Dinger had decided to release the album himself privately, and he did this the following year on the L.S.D. label. This was to be the only L.S.D. release, available by mail order on both LP and CD, limited to 1000 copies. The CD version came with a 20-minute bonus jam, whilst the LP was packaged with a large D.E.D.H. poster. When Dinger signed to Captain Trip Records in 1995, his new label bought up the remaining copies of the album and marketed them in Japan with a new inlay and catalogue number.

Dynactin is the essential component for microtubule-based cytoplasmic dynein motor activity in intracellular transport of a variety of cargoes and organelles. Identification and structure DCTN6 was first identified and cloned as a subunit of the \\"pointed-end complex\\" of dynactin through biochemical purification. X-ray crystal structure revealed that dynactin p27 forms an unusual left handed Œ≤-helix (LŒ≤H) domain, and its phosphorylation site T186 is in C-terminal disordered segment. Function In intracellular transport Dynactin p27 forms a hetero-dimer with the other dynactin pointed-end complex subunit p25/DCTN5 in 1:1 ratio, and it is essential for p25 stability since they are co-knockdown by p27 RNAi. However, both p27 and p25 are not required for 19S dynactin complex integrity verified by velocity sedimentation. p27/DCTN6 and other dynactin pointed-end complex subunits (Arp11/Actr10, p62/DCTN4, and p25/DCTN5) have been suggested to be involved in dynactin binding to specific intracellular cargoes. Co-depletion of dynactin p27 and p25 by p27 RNAi affects dynactin binding to endomembrane, and early and recycling endosome movements are impaired, suggesting that p27/p25 form a selective endomembrane cargo-targeting module. In mitosis In mitosis, unlike dynactin or dynein perturbation that causes mitotic spindle disarrangement and mitotic arrest, dynactin p27/p25 depletion does not affect mitotic spindle formation, pole focusing or dynein/dynactin targeting to kinetochores. However, dynactin p27/p25 are required for normal chromosome alignment, kinetochore-microtubule interaction, and proper timing of anaphase onset. Dynactin p27 C-terminal T186 residue is phosphorylated by cyclin- dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) in mitosis and helps target polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to kinetochores during prometaphase. This activity facilitates phosphorylation of important downstream kinetochore targets (such as tension- sensing 3F3/2 phospho-epitope) of Plk1, which is important for recruitment of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins such as Mad1 and proper kinetochore- microtubule attachment.

Whitcombe was originally recorded as Widecome, with a land measurement of two hides. King Athelstan gave it to the Milton Abbey. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, its ownership passed to the King. Around 1600, it was sold to a Mr Hull from Tolpuddle. Whitcombe Hill is located west of the church. A Portland stone relief of a bearded man on horseback, dating from 2nd‚Äì3rd century AD, was found here in 1963 and subsequently added to the collection of the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester.

It started out as the Hemker Game Farm. In 1980, the farm acquired its first pair of white-tail deer and a black bear. The zoo expanded in 1985 when it acquired a pronghorn antelope and a pair of reindeer. In 1992, the Hemker Game Farm became the Hemker Wildlife Park and later that same year added six black-footed penguins to their collection. Finally in 1994, the Hemker Wildlife Park opened to the public for the first time. The turn of the century brought new exhibits to the Hemker Wildlife Park such as the African Safari. In 2006, beloved owner Mark Hemker died, but his family made the decision to keep the zoo open in his memory. In 2008, Hemker Wildlife Park became the Hemker Park & Zoo and added a new picnic area and farm petting zoo. In 2010, the penguins returned and in 2012 the zoo added two New Guinea singing dogs - Gus and Lucy.

He began his education at the local school; an exceptional student he received a scholarship to study medicine under Lord Lister at the University of Edinburgh, where he qualified as a physician and surgeon. In early life he gained considerable practical experience, when serving as a medical officer in the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78), where he was involved in the siege of Plevna. In 1879 he arrived at Aspatria where he became junior partner to Dr William Hodgson. His reputation as a medical practitioner was quickly recognised and upon the death of his partner he assumed the business, employing Ian McQuarry as assistant. When, in the 1920s, McQuarry left the area he was replaced Archibald Rankin, whose descendants were still practicing in the town in the early part of the twenty-first century.West Cumberland Times, 25 April 1928 Medical officer of health In accordance with the requirements of the Public Health Act 1875http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1875/pdf/ukpga_18750055_en.pdf Briggs became Medical Officer of Health to the Wigton Rural District Sanitary Board in the mid 1880s, a position he continued to fulfil until the end of his life.West Cumberland Times, 25 April 1928 In September 1892, after the creation of the Aspatria Local Board, he also became their Medical Officer of Health.West Cumberland Times, 20 September 1892 A position he retained in 1895, after the Local Government Act 1894 created the Aspatria Urban District Council. The role demanded the submission of a quarterly and annual report, which although concise contained a series of informative statistics. He also had a responsibility for ensuring the health of the water supply which originally came from a series of wells and Pumps in the district; the sewerage system, the slaughterhouses and the ash tips. He also had to notify the department of health whenever an infectious disease occurred. In 1901, he informed the council that from a population of 2,888 the birth rate was 25.3 per 1,000; death rate 13.5 per 1,000; infant mortality, rate of deaths under one year per 1,000 births 137; Zygotic rate 2.7; tubercular rate 1.5; cancer rate 2.07. During that year he had registered 73 births, 48 males and 33 females. He also registered 37 deaths, which related to one in 13.5 per 1,000. Ten deaths had occurred under one year of age, seven aged between 1 and 5, three between the age of 5 and 15, one between 15 and 25, thirteen between 25 and 65 and five over 65 years. Five deaths were attributed to measles, one to whooping cough, one to diphtheria, one to enteric fever, one to influenza, three to phthisis, two to other tubercular diseases, six to cancer, one to bronchitis, one to pneumonia, one to alcoholism, three to premature births, four to heart disease, three to accidents, and six to various other causes. He had notified the authorities on 18 occasions when infectious diseases had occurred, these included nine cases of scarlet fever, six of erysipelas, two typhoid fever, and one of diphtheria.West Cumberland Times, 19 January 1901 Working practice Briggs was a modern practitioner with a flair for modern methods and modern ideas. He understood the correlation between life expectancy, public health and the living conditions of the people; he understood the relationship between dirt and infection. In his endeavour to improve the quality of life of the people he championed many social reforms. He was largely responsible for the introduction of the Overwater Gravitational Water Scheme, from which Aspatria and Silloth draw their drinking water.Usher Thomas pages 46-47 He also proposed the laying of sewers within Aspatria; thus eliminating a major source of the prevailing insanitary conditions that directly led to the epidemic killer diseases, Cholera and Typhoid. He also challenged the evils of acute household overcrowding. When the opportunity arose, he encouraged the Urban District Council to build two successful housing schemes in the district. On one occasion he had the satisfaction of reporting the lowest death rate of any other urban district in England and Wales, upon which he received many congratulations from the medical fraternity. Briggs practiced medicine at a time when the country doctor was expected to be a ‚Äòmaster of all trades‚Äô; he was not a GP in the modern sense, hospitalisation in rural communities was rare, if not unheard of. He had to contend with a variety of epidemics in addition to the Coal mining and agricultural accidents, many of which required major surgery and amputations.Rose and Dunglinson pages 173-177 Community work Dr William Perry Briggs, Opening War Memorial 18 October 1922 In politics he was a liberal and a true champion for the welfare of the common people; he took a great interest in the church and was the chairman of the war memorial committee; for an extensive period he was also a commissioner for income tax for the Allerdale Below Derwent Division. In sport he took a keen interest in Cricket; first playing for the Aspatria and Brayton club before taking on the administrative role of president, a position he held for over thirty years.West Cumberland Times, 21 April 1928 Towards the latter end of the nineteenth century he was also president of the Aspatria Rugby Union Football Club. Family and death Doctor Briggs was twice married and had a son and daughter to his first wife. He died on 20 April 1928, aged 72 years. His remains lie in the shadow of the mock Gosforth Cross at the eastern end of Aspatria churchyard.West Cumberland Times, 25 April 1928 References External links *Text of the statute as originally enacted (PDF) * Local Government Act 1894 (56 & 57 Vict. c. 73) Bibliography * * Category:History of Cumbria Category:Allerdale Category:People from Aspatria Category:1856 births Category:1928 deaths Category:English surgeons Category:People from Wigton Category:20th-century English medical doctors Category:20th-century surgeons ","title":"William Perry Briggs"},{"id":"39111200","title":"Lunafly"},{"id":"39111234","text":"Alias Empire are an Irish alternative electronic band based in Dublin.

It is currently known from H√† Giang and Cao B·∫±ng provinces in northern Vietnam, although its actual range probably wider; there is a photograph to suggest it also occurs in L√†o Cai Province in Vietnam, and its range likely extends to Yunnan in southern China. Based on molecular genetic data, Tylototriton ziegleri belongs to the \\"Tylototriton asperrimus group\\" of newts. The specific name ziegleri honours , a German herpetologist. Description The single known female is in snout‚Äìvent length (SVL); males are SVL. The head is wider than it is long and hexagonal in shape. The head has prominent dorsolateral bony ridges and a prominent but short middorsal ridge. The snout is short and truncate. The body is moderately stout and has prominent, segmented vertebral ridge as well as rows of distinct rib nodules, forming knob-like warts. The tail is laterally compressed and has a pointed tip; the tail length is about the same as SVL. The hands and feet are free of webbing. The dorsum is uniformly black; the venter is slightly lighter than the dorsum. The rib nodules, finger and toe tips, parts of soles and palms, anterior end of vent, and ventral ridge of tail are typically bright orange, with some individual variation in the orange markings. Tylototriton ziegleri male Habitat and conservation Tylototriton ziegleri are known from bamboo-dominated subtropical evergreen forests at elevations of above sea level. Adults are largely terrestrial and hidden in refugia on the forest floor. The eggs clutches are laid on the ground near ponds in April‚ÄìMay. After hatching, the larvae crawl to the pond during rainy weather. Larvae do not overwinter but metamorphose after July. Tylototriton ziegleri is threatened by the degradation and loss of suitable habitat and breeding sites. It might also suffer from collection for the pet trade and traditional medicines. One of the known populations resides in the Pia Oac Nature Reserve. Its likely range overlaps with some other protected areas.

Her father had been a tenant farmer and eventually earned enough to buy a home and some land in the township. At age nine, Algia Mae learned the guitar from her mother, who was a singer and a guitarist expert in the Piedmont finger-picking style, and who often played at family gatherings, house parties, and services at the local congregation.Music Makers: Portraits and Songs from the Roots of America, ed. Timothy Duffy (Athens, GA: Hill Street Press, 2002), p.79. From her father, who was a dancer, Algia Mae learned buck dancing and the two-step.Barrow, Serving the Lord and the Devil, Too. Algia Mae married Millard R. Hinton in 1950. They subsequently moved to Raleigh, where they had seven children. The marriage lasted until 1965, when Millard Hinton was killed. At this point, Algia Mae moved with her children back to the O'Neal township and earned income as a field laborer. In the meantime, she played at house parties in Johnston County, North Carolina and for her children. Hinton met the folklorist Glenn Hinson in 1978, who arranged for her performance at that year's North Carolina Folklife Festival. She subsequently performed at the National Folk Festival, the University of Chicago Folk Festival, and in 1985 at an event called \\"Southern Roots\\" at Carnegie Hall that featured Delta and Piedmont blues artists.'Jon Pareles, \\"Rural South's Rich Culture Is Explored in Concerts,\\" The New York Times, 18 January 1981, C20.

They are credited with helping to mobilize Senegal's youth vote and oust incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade, though the group claims no affiliation with Macky Sall, Senegal's current president, or with any political party. Background The group was founded by rappers Fou Malade (\\"Crazy Sick Guy\\", real name: Malal Talla), Thiat (\\"Junior\\", real name: Cheikh Oumar Cyrille Tour√©), Kilifeu (both from celebrated rap crew \\"Keur Gui of Kaolack\\") and journalists Sheikh Fadel Barro, Aliou Sane and Denise Sow. The movement was originally started in reaction to Dakar's frequent power cuts, but the group quickly concluded that they were \\"fed up\\" with an array of problems in Senegalese society. Activities Through recordings, rallies and a network of regional affiliates, called \\"the spirit of Y'en a Marre\\", the group advocates for youth to embrace a new type of thinking and living termed \\"The New Type of Senegalese\\" or NTS. In late 2011, the collective released a compilation titled \\"Y'en A Marre\\", from which the single \\"Faux! Pas Forc√©\\" emerged as a rallying cry for youth frustrated with President Wade and his son and presumed successor. They followed with a single, \\"Doggali\\" (\\"Let's finish\\"), which advocated for cleansing the country of Wade and son. The group and their members campaigned door to door to register young Senegalese to vote and claim that more than 300,000 voters were registered with Y'en a Marre's assistance and urging. On February 16, 2012, three of the group's founders were arrested for helping to organize a sit-in at Dakar's Obelisk Square. Despite arrests, the group continued to organize protests up until the election that unseated Wade. Role in politics Despite reaching the goal of ousting Wade, Y'en a Marre remains active, hosting meetings and shows, urging the new government to implement promised reforms, including reforms of land ownership, a key issue for Senegal's rural poor. Y'en a Marre is particularly significant in Senegalese politics, because in his 2000 campaign, Abdoulaye Wade prominently featured the support of Senegalese rappers as a way of connecting with young voters. 12 years later, Y'en a Marre demonstrated that Senegal's youth were not unquestioningly loyal to Wade and were searching for a leader who could credibly promise reform.

Moghadam and Doug Abbey used a $50,000 line of credit to found Abbey, Moghadam and Company, an investment manager serving institutions. They were joined by T. Robert Burke in 1984 and established AMB Property Corporation, which invested in office, industrial and community shopping centers on behalf of large institutional investors. During the savings and loan crisis, the company avoided significant financial repercussions by investing in industrial parks and shopping centers, and began to exit the office market in 1987. AMB launched its first private equity fund in 1989, which focused on industrial and retail properties. In late 1997, AMB became a public company via an initial public offering, with more than US$2.8 billion under management. In 1999, the company sold its retail business to focus solely on the industrial sector. The company made its first overseas investment in 2002, developing a facility for Procter & Gamble. That year, AMB initiated an international expansion program focused on buying and developing distribution facilities near global trade hubs, particularly in growth markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and China. AMB added an internal development division in 2004. By 2011, AMB was focusing on expanding its operations in China and Brazil. Security Capital Industrial Trust (SCI), a legacy company to Prologis, was formed in 1991. SCI became a public company via an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. The company first expanded outside the United States in 1996 with acquisitions in Mexico and in 1997 it acquired properties in both Mexico and Europe. SCI invested in the Netherlands in the summer of 1997 and then expanded into Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Warsaw, London, Berlin, Milan, and Madrid. SCI purchased 33% of Insight Inc. in October 1997 to help solve supply-chain problems for clients. SCI also expanded into the refrigerated distribution business in 1997, purchasing Christian Salvesen and renaming it as CS Integrated LLC. SCI acquired Texas Cold Storage and Continental Freezer in 1997 and secured the primary contract to distribute food for Kroger Co. in Illinois. For refrigeration abroad, SCI purchased Frigoscandia AB, then Europe's largest distributor of refrigerated goods. SCI later exited the cold- storage business. Prologis, Inc. was incorporated on November 24, 1997. SCI officially changed its name to ProLogis in July 1998. SCI was active in 84 markets in 12 countries by July 1998, with a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion. In November 1998, Prologis Trust acquired Meridian Industrial Trust for $862.5 million in stock. At the time, Prologis was the \\"largest owner of industrial and warehouse properties in the United States.\\" ProLogis formed its first property funds in 1999, and entered the Japanese market in 2001. In 2003, ProLogis was added to the S&P; 500 Index and entered the Chinese market, and in 2004 the company acquired Keystone Industrial Trust for $1.6 billion. In the same year, ProLogis formed its first joint venture in China with Suzhou Logistics Center Co. Ltd. With headquarters in Aurora, Colorado, at the time, in 2005 ProLogis completed a merger with Catellus Development Corporation, a North American industrial development company, for $4.9 billion. ProLogis ranked first in the 2005 Top 25 Industrial Owners survey. The company acquired Catellus Development in 2005 for $3.6 billion. In 2006, ProLogis became a Fortune 1000 company and the ProLogis European Properties Fund became a public company. In the midst of problems with debt following aggressive expansion and heavy borrowing, ProLogis' CEO Jeffrey Schwartz was replaced with Walter Rakowich in 2008. Rakowich afterwards implemented a cost-cutting effort involving raising capital and selling assets. In December 2008, ProLogis sold a portfolio of assets to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. It sold its China operations and some of its Japanese interests to GIC Private Limited for $1.3 billion in 2009. In August 2009, ProLogis secured financing from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and an unidentified German bank for two of its funds. The Blackstone Group bought a portfolio of assets from the company in late 2010 for $1 billion. In January 2011, the company sold a portfolio of Catellus retail and mixed-use assets to affiliates of TPG Capital for $505 million, including rights to the Catellus name. In March 2011, prior to the merger with ProLogis, AMB Property formed a ‚Ç¨470 million joint venture with Allianz Real Estate. In January 2011, AMB Property Corporation agreed to buy the larger ProLogis for $8.7 billion, with the new entity named Prologis. The companies announced that the new Prologis would be based in San Francisco, AMB's hometown, but would maintain an office in Denver, Colorado, where ProLogis was based. Completed in June 2011, the merger was one of the biggest real-estate deals since the Great Recession, and it created the largest industrial real estate company in the world. With total market value estimated at $24 billion, the new Prologis had around $46 billion in assets under management and logistics and distribution facilities in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Clients of the new company included DHL, Kuehne + Nagel, Home Depot Inc., Unilever, and FedEx. AMB CEO Hamid R. Moghadam and ProLogis CEO Walter Rakowich were appointed as the new company's co-chiefs, with Moghadam to become the sole CEO in 2013. In August 2011, the company sold a 378,298-square-foot industrial property in Grove City, Ohio for $12.4 million. The company also acquired a warehouse in Tolleson, Arizona for $9.95 million. In February 2012, the company sold a 3.5 million square foot portfolio in the United Kingdom to The Blackstone Group for $335 million. In June 2012, the company sold the 10 buildings in Memphis, Tennessee. In November 2012, the company sold a 1.98 million square portfolio in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul for $96.6 million.

In August 2013, in partnership with The Blackstone Group the company acquired a 17 million square foot portfolio for $960 million from Lehman Brothers. In September 2013, the company sold 3 warehouses in Tempe, Arizona for $22 million. In November 2013, Prologis announced plans to spend \\"as much as $600 million a year to develop warehouses in Japan,\\" its biggest market after the United States, where it had customers such as Amazon.com and Nippon Express. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company acquired a 1.8 million square foot portfolio in Nashville, Tennessee. In April 2014, the company acquired a 117,600 square foot warehouse in Hanover, Maryland for $8.65 million. In May 2014, the company acquired two industrial buildings in Charlotte, North Carolina for $17.5 million. In June 2014, the company completed the corporate spin-off of FIBRA Prologis, the company‚Äôs Mexican affiliate also known as Prologis Property Mexico SA, raising about 7 billion pesos ($541 million). The company also sold a 59-property portfolio to TPG for $375 million. In September 2014, the company sold a former Big Lots warehouse in Columbus, Ohio for $8.5 million. At the end of 2014, Prologis owned 2,853 properties, with the bulk in North America and around 600 in Europe and Asia. In March 2015, the company acquired an 18-acre development site in La Vergne, Tennessee for $2.35 million. Prologis had reduced its number of managed funds from 23 to 11 by the spring of 2015, and was managing \\"$29 billion in real- estate assets through joint ventures and a series of funds backed by institutional investors.\\" That quarter, the company sold a Silicon Valley industrial park to Facebook, Inc. With corporate headquarters remaining in San Francisco, in April 2015 Prologis announced a plan to move offices from east Denver, Colorado, to a new building in downtown Denver in 2017. In June 2015, Prologis partnered with Norges Bank Investment Management to buy KTR Capital Partners for $5.9 billion, expanding Prologis' real estate portfolio in the United States through the Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture. In October 2015, Prologis acquired Morris Realty Associates' portfolio of logistics and retail properties in the United States for $820 million. Prologis sold the retail asset portion of this portfolio to an affiliate of The Blackstone Group for $374 million. Prologis formed its venture capital arm in March 2016 and had made 20 investments by late 2019. By late 2016, Prologis had built large multistory warehouses in Japan, Singapore and China. The company began construction on a three-floor warehouse in Seattle, Washington, in November 2016, which was the first multi-story warehouse in the country. The following month, Prologis also outlined plans to build a three-story warehouse in San Francisco. In December 2016, Prologis received two 2016 Eurobuild CEE Awards. In November 2016, the company acquired 40 acres in Denver.

Prologis began releasing a series of special reports on the industrial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, noting that an increase an e-commerce would likely result in companies increasing their inventories, in turn increasing the demand for warehousing.

The design was eventually shortened and simplified to its current design, which resembles 3100 Clarendon Blvd in the nearby Clarendon neighborhood. Its height was controversial, due to its rivaling the nearby Washington Monument, as well as being in the flight path of Washington National Airport. While agencies such as the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission have raised objections to tall buildings in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., they have been unsuccessful in stopping construction of such buildings, as they do not have jurisdiction over those areas.

He was lynched by the Ku Klux Klan on February 26, 1870. His death, along with the assassination of white Republican State Senator John W. Stephens at the Caswell County Courthouse, provoked Governor William Woods Holden to declare martial law in Alamance and Caswell Counties, resulting in the Kirk-Holden War of 1870.Troxler, Carole Watterson and William Murray Vincent (1999). Shuttle & Plow: A History of Alamance County, North Carolina. Alamance County Historical Association.The Hillsboro Recorder, April 6, 1870.  Biography  Outlaw was apparently of mixed racial heritage. He was mentioned in a letter as being the son of a white Alamance County slave-owner Chesley F. Faucett, and apparently lived on the tobacco farm of Nancy Outlaw on Jordan Creek, northeast of Graham, North Carolina. Sources conflict on the question of whether Outlaw was born a slave or a free person of color. Outlaw served in the 2nd Regiment U. S. Colored Cavalry from 1864-1866. He served in various engagements in Virginia and late in the Civil War was stationed on the Rio Grande in Texas until he was mustered out in February 1866. After returning from his service in the Civil War, Outlaw became a prominent African-American in Alamance County. In 1868, Outlaw was among a number of trustees who were deeded land for the establishment of the first African Methodist Episcopal Church in Alamance County. He was also prominently involved in the Union League and the Republican Party. Outlaw's prominent activities on behalf of African Americans in Alamance County made him a target of the White Brotherhood, the Constitutional Union Guard, and the Ku Klux Klan. As a prominent Republican in Alamance County, Outlaw was appointed to the Graham Town Council by Governor Holden and soon became one of three constables of the town - all three of whom were African Americans.Whitaker, Walter (1949). Centennial History of Alamance County 1849-1949. Burlington Chamber of Commerce. On one occasion in 1869, white residents of the area who were incensed by the prospect of being policed by an all African-American constabulary organized a nighttime ride in Klan garb through the streets of Graham in an effort to frighten the African- American constables. Outlaw and another constable opened fire on the night riders, but no injuries were sustained. Outlaw's aggressive response to the night riders further inflamed the anger of Klan sympathizers. The night of February 26, 1870, a party of unidentified men rode into Graham, dragged Outlaw from his home and hung him from an elm tree in the courthouse square in Graham, in what is now known as Sesquicentennial Park, located at .Grand jury testimony of James Fonville, recorded in The Southern Home, March 7, 1871. http://lynching.web.unc.edu/files/2015/05/The_Southern_Home_Tue__Mar_7__1871_.jpg Outlaw's body bore on the chest a message from the perpetrators: \\"Beware, ye guilty, both black and white.\\" The Greensboro Patriot, March 3, 1870.Wyatt Outlaw memorial ODMP website A local African-American man named Puryear claimed to know who was responsible for the lynching, but Puryear was soon found dead in a nearby pond. In 1873, Guilford County Superior Court Judge Albion Tourgee advocated for re-visiting the murder of Wyatt Outlaw. That year the Grand Jury of Alamance County brought felony indictments against 63 Klansmen, including 18 murder counts, in connection with the lynching of Wyatt Outlaw. However, the Democratic-controlled state legislature repealed the laws under which most of these indictments had been brought, so the charges were dropped. No one was ever tried in connection with Outlaw's murder.

Biography  Early life Paul Schaefer was born on May 25, 1950, in Belleville, Illinois to Francis and Claire Schaefer, a devout Catholic family of German descent. While attending a Roman Catholic elementary school, he attended mass daily, served as an altar boy and sang in the church choir. In 1968 he graduated from Catholic High School and then attended Southern Illinois University from 1968 to 1972. After graduating, he saw problems in the Roman Catholic Church; he stopped attending services and began to search for the truth, including in Buddhist and other eastern sources. In 1974, he moved to San Jose, California, and found out about Orthodox Christianity through a Greek man, discovering the Orthodox Church. He was baptised that year at the Greek Orthodox Church in Modesto, California, and given the name Makarios (or Macarius) in honor of Saint Macarius the Great. He started attending St. Nicholas Church, San Jose, before attending the Greek Cathedral in San Francisco. as well as a Russian church. His brother, Rev. Edward Schaefer, is a Catholic priest serving in the Diocese of Belleville, IL. https://www.diobelle.org/directory/priests/schaefer-reverend-edward-f Monastic life In January 1975, Makarios visited Mount Athos, where he decided to become a monk. He later visited the St. Herman of Alaska Monastery, Platina, California, where he met Seraphim (Rose) and Herman (Podmoshensky) and was immersed in the monastic life. They suggested he enrol in seminary, which he did, entering Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary in September 1975. On Christmas, January 7, 1976, Makarios was made a novice by Archbishop Averky (Taushev). As a novice his obediences in the monastery were working in the farm and cemetery. He spent the next summer in Platina, California, and helped Fr. Seraphim and Fr. Herman to print books and do other jobs. Divine services were in English unlike Jordanville: \\"I understood every word, which touched my heart\\". On Friday of the First Week of Lent, 1979, after a few years in the monastery he was tonsured a rassophore monk. On Friday of the First Week of Lent, 1980, he was tonsured into the small schema and given the name Mitrophan in honor of Saint Mitrophan of Voronezh. On Palm Sunday of the same year he was ordained a subdeacon and a couple of months thereafter he graduated from Holy Trinity Seminary. In June 1981 he was given a blessing by Archbishop Laurus (≈†kurla) to relocate to Mount Athos. Initially, he lived in Skete of Prophet Elijah for several months, a strict skete which was then connected with ROCOR. On the advice of elder Nicodemus of Karoulia, he then moved to an English-speaking cell within Koutloumousiou monastery with four other ROCOR monks, which was one that other monasteries would often send American visitors to. He became acquainted with St. Paisios the Athonite while there. He was tonsured to the great schema by hieromonk Chrysostomos of Koutloumousiou and given the name George in honor of Saint George the Great-Martyr. In February, 1986 he returned to Holy Trinity Monastery and started working on the Print Shop of Saint Job of Pochaev in 1986, where he worked until 1998. He assumed editorial duties on \\"Orthodox Life\\" from 1992 to his consecration as bishop in 2008. On the feast of St. Michael, 1986 he was ordained a hierodeacon. On Palm Sunday, 1987 he was ordained a hieromonk. In 1994 he was appointed as economos Holy Trinity Monastery. In September 1998 he was elevated to the rank of hegumen. On September 5, 2005, at the Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the monastery, Metropolitan Laurus (≈†kurla) elevated him to the rank of archimandrite. He is the author of several articles and translations published in \\"Orthodox Life\\". He translated several sayings of the Optina Elders published in the book \\"Living Without Hypocrisy\\", published in 2006 by Holy Trinity Monastery Press. He also served as confessor and spiritual father of the Hermitage of the Holy Cross in Wayne, West Virginia, the largest English-language monastery of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. Life as a Bishop Bishop George at the altar during paschal matins at Holy Cross Monastery On May 15, 2008, the Council of Bishops of the ROCOR decreed to send the curricula vitae of archimandrite George (Schaefer) and protopriest John Shaw along with accompanying appeals to Patriarch Alexius II of Moscow and All Russia for the confirmation of their candidacies for episcopal consecration. The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church confirmed their election (together with previously elected archimandrite Theodosius (Ivashchenko)) on June 23, 2008. Archimandrite George, having no internet, found out about his appointment from the congratulations of friends. On December 7, 2008 Archimandrite George was consecrated bishop at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York, by Bishop Gabriel (Chemodakov) of Montreal and Canada, Bishop Peter (Loukianoff) of Cleveland and Bishop John (Bƒìrzi≈Ü≈°) of Caracas, receiving the title of Bishop of Mayfield. Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral), the vicar of whom he became, could not be present, as was preparing to attend the funeral of Patriarch Alexius II in Russia. Bishop George's place of residence was then at the Hermitage of the Holy Cross in Wayne, West Virginia. On May 7, 2009 he was elected abbot of the Holy Cross Monastery in Wayne, WV. Synod of Bishops of ROCOR on May 5‚Äì7, 2009 decided to form a commission to study the relationship with the Orthodox Church in America and to hold joint meetings to discuss the sources of the division between the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia and the American Metropoliate; bishop George became its president; also Synod of Bishops decided to reassign the Holy Cross Hermitage, which formerly was an affiliated monastery (a podvorie) of the Holy Trinity Monastery, to Eastern American Diocese, entrusting with arranging for the election of its abbot\\". The month bishop George was elected abbot of Holy Cross Monastery by its brethren.

As with all beaches in Cyprus, access to the public is free, whilst bed and umbrella hire is chargeable. A municipal car park provides parking within a short walk. The sandy beach stretches for 500m and the waters are clean enough for the beach to have been awarded blue flag designation. The beach, which runs the length of its own cove, takes its name from the fig trees located close to the coast. There is an uninhabited islet easily reached by swimming through the shallow waters, the location of which provides a good shelter for the rest of the beach. The islet is covered with low level local vegetation. In contrast to other local beaches, such as Nissi, Fig Tree Bay has become a popular destination for families. Water sports such as water-skiing, windsurfing, and parasailing are available. From April to October, lifeguards and lifesaving equipment are available on the beach from 9am to 6pm.

She is best known today for her two autobiographical diaries, which are among the earliest known examples of autobiography written by an Englishwoman. Although a wealthy woman, Anne Cotterill has said that for Isham her ‚Äúmind was more to her than wealth.‚ÄùAnne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 233. Early life and family Elizabeth Isham, the eldest of three children, was born in 1609 at Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire, England. John Isham, her great-grandfather, was a small mercer and merchant-adventurer who later became a wealthy woolens merchant and master warden of the Company of Mercers. He purchased Lamport Hall in 1560 from Sir William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, and it became the family estate. Elizabeth's father, Sir John Isham (1582‚Äì1651), was made the first baronet of Lamport by Charles I in 1627, when she was eighteen. Her mother was Judith Lewyn Isham (d. 1625), daughter of William Lewin, who was an educated Anglican judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury and a master in chancery. Elizabeth's sister (also called Judith) was born a year after Elizabeth. Her royalist brother Justinian (1610-1675), the second baronet of Lamport, left for Oxford during the English Civil War, leaving Elizabeth to care for her father and four nieces, and to manage the estate. The estate was later sequestered by Parliament.Anne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 227. Judith, Elizabeth's mother, had a close relationship with each of her children, and played a significant role in Elizabeth's religious upbringing.Isaac Stephens, ‚ÄúConfessional Identity in Early Stuart England: The ‚ÄòPrayer Book Puritanism‚Äô of Elizabeth Isham‚Äù Journal of British Studies, Vol.50 (2011), 29. At the age of eight or nine, Elizabeth learned the verses of the ‚ÄòPsalm Book‚Äô by memorization. Judith also gave both Elizabeth and Judith a prayer book to pray with two or three times a day. Elizabeth grew up to become an extremely pious young woman with a strong sense of her religious duties and calling.Isaac Stephens, ‚ÄúThe Courtship and Singlehood of Elizabeth Isham, 1630-1634‚Äù The Historical Journal, Vol.51 (2008), 11. As a young woman, Elizabeth had to decide whether to obeying her father's wishes to marry and raise a family, or to remain single in order to devote her life to God. She determined not to marry, and her father ultimately supported her in this decision. Personal life and death Elizabeth spent most of her life at her family estate of Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire, but she did on occasion visit relatives in London.Isaac Stephens, ‚ÄúThe Courtship and Singlehood of Elizabeth Isham, 1630-1634,‚Äù 13. The capital city provided greater opportunities for a young woman to find a suitable marriage partner, so when aged eighteen Elizabeth was sent by her father to stay there with her uncle, James Pagitt. Elizabeth found both city life and suitors not to her liking. She found it difficult to choose between devoting herself to marriage and motherhood, or to God. She decided that she could not engage in both to their fullest potential, so chose to pursue the religious life.Julie A. Eckerle, ‚ÄúComing to Knowledge: Elizabeth Isham‚Äôs Autobiography and the Self-Construction of an Intellectual Woman‚Äù (Chapel Hill: The Autobiography Society, 2010), 109. Elizabeth's choice to reject marriage resulted from both the hardships faced from her failed relationships and difficult decisions made of her devotion to God. She would have had all the benefits of marriage, of becoming a widow, and becoming a mother and heir to the estates if she had married her father's choice of suitors. However, none of that mattered to her.Isaac Stephens, ‚ÄúThe Courtship and Singlehood of Elizabeth Isham, 1630-1634,‚Äù 24. This freedom during the 17th century for women was rare and eventually opened doors to a whole new light that being single was not strict grounds for rejection in society. Elizabeth was able to find and follow her vocational calling.Isaac Stephens, ‚ÄúThe Courtship and Singlehood of Elizabeth Isham, 1630-1634,‚Äù 25. Another reason for staying single may have been that Elizabeth enjoyed solitude and privacy to pray and to spiritually connect with God, given that ‚Äúshe often preferred to be alone, busying herself with work.‚ÄùAnne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 241. Although she never had children, Elizabeth helped her brother to raise his four young daughters after his wife, Jane, died soon after giving birth to a son. Elizabeth took on the role of a surrogate mother for the girls. In fact, she died along her most treasured work, the ‚ÄúBooke of Remembrance‚Äù to them for their religious education.Isaac Stephens, ‚ÄúConfessional Identity in Early Stuart England: The ‚ÄòPrayer Book Puritanism‚Äô of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 34. Elizabeth died in 1654 at the age of 45, three years after her father's death.Anne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 228. Herbalism Women often practiced as herbalists in the midst of their household/domestic tasks. On the one hand women had a lot of practical medical knowledge but on the other hand they were not seen as respected members of the medical hierarchy. The one exception to this might be elite women who were respected for their skills. Elizabeth's primary motivation and interest in medicine, and specifically herbalism, peaked through the history of illnesses of many of her close family members: her paternal grandmother (d.1621) died due to a terminal illness; her mother (d.1625) died from chronic poor health and possible pneumonia; her sister (d.1636), who was both ill as well as experiencing several broken bones;Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650 (Surrey: Ashgate Publishing Limited), 123. and her sister-in-law Jane (d.1639) died after giving birth to her fifth child.Anne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 227. Elizabeth's mother died at the age of 34 when she was 16 years old.Anne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 230. Elizabeth's decision to pursue herbal knowledge started in her mid-twenties.Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 132. Physicians often visited the Isham household due to illnesses in the family. Elizabeth grew to distrust the methods and diagnoses of these physicians, and their invasive surgeries which often led to death. Hence, Elizabeth turned to herbal remedies and studied them as an alternative means of healthcare. By consulting a skilled herbalist called Mr. Naper, commonly called ‚ÄúSandy,‚Äù she began to use cordials and herbal remedies known as ‚Äúphysicks.‚Äù The cordials aided the recovery of her mother Judith, and reportedly helped her to live another year.Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 125. This was the advent of Elizabeth thinking there were non-invasive alternatives to help cure people of illnesses. Another driving force behind Elizabeth's interest in herbals and medicine was the fact that her great-grandmother and aunt had notable skills in medicine. Elizabeth's great-grandmother was a skilled surgeon, and her aunt was a strong motivator to drive her to pursue herbal knowledge through borrowed books.Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 127. Elizabeth had a great interest in gardening, and from there she sought to learn more about herbals through gardening books.Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 122. It was uncommon for women during this era to attend schools, but elite women did have an opportunity to learn Latin with tutors at home. However, Elizabeth went on to pursue learning more about herbals rather than Latin. She also attempted to learn French to acclimate with the women of the London society, but never completed her lessons. Elizabeth's familial inheritance of females who already had medical knowledge, gave her the ‚Äúauthoritative background‚Äù necessary to pursue her interest in herbalism. Herbalism might have also been a part of Elizabeth's religious life as another part of her ‚Äúreligious calling/duty‚Äù to help others. Elizabeth interpreted that ‚Äúsurrounding all is Christ‚Äôs example providing ‚Äòthe way.‚Äô‚Äù She found a voice through God that this was her calling in life. There has also been ‚Äúevidence that Isham was taking medical notes well into the 1640s, particularly from a translation of Giovanni da Vigo, the surgeon‚Ä¶‚Äù Elizabeth also noted what was incorporated in her mother's cordials as well as in food such as meat, and they included: rosemary, sage, marjoram, betony, and sassafras. She wrote many of these notes through her practice and observations rather than from her memory.Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 133. Elizabeth found her own voice as an individual by her choice to practice herbalism, which was of far greater importance to her rather than learning Latin.Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 134. Diarist and ‚ÄúMy Booke of Rememberance‚Äù Elizabeth began to write at the early age of seven or eight, and continued to write extensively throughout her lifetime. During her early years of writing, she had a natural inclination to write and to copy texts and use the vocabulary she learned in her own works.Anne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 236. Cotterill mentions that from an early age, Elizabeth ‚Äúconstantly read, copied down, studied, memorized, and repeated prayers, psalms, chapters of the Bible, excerpts from collections of biblical ‚Äòplaces,‚Äô literary texts, and sermons.‚ÄùAnne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 236, 246-247. She resorted to writing as an outlet from her depression due to the deaths of her mother and sister and debates with her father over her marriage. Writing was a means of comfort to Elizabeth and ‚Äúshe turned to writing as a way of using God‚Äôs word when she felt herself in danger of rejecting it.‚Äù Around 1638‚Äì1639 when Elizabeth was 30, she composed her first extensive work called ‚ÄúMy Booke of Rememberance‚Äù, where she recorded her thoughts, beliefs, explanations for her decisions, her struggles, and the freedom of her single life.Julie A. Eckerle, ‚ÄúComing to Knowledge: Elizabeth Isham‚Äôs Autobiography and the Self- Construction of an Intellectual Woman,‚Äù 97. She specifically talked about her struggles in dealing with the loss of her mother and sister who were close to her, the unsuccessful relationship between her and her father's recommended suitor, and her quest for a single life. She wrote this was her moment at ‚Äúthe pitts brinke of despair‚Äù since she wrote this during her most troubled times.Anne Cotterill, ‚ÄúFit Words at the ‚Äòpitts brinke‚Äô: The Achievement of Elizabeth Isham,‚Äù 240. Personal hobbies and interests Elizabeth also had interests and hobbies such as gardening, needlework, painting, and reading, in particular religious literature. Her interests in needlework and gardening also provide the ‚Äúoccupational backdrop‚Äù that would be helpful for her in practicing herbalism. Through her enjoyment from gardening, she found there were links to gardening and her study of plants and medicine. She discovered that some plants, in particular herbs, could potentially be used for medicinal purposes.Rebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 128. Elizabeth found hobbies, especially needlework to be a ‚Äúkind of preventative cure‚Äù for depression. Elizabeth took herbalism seriously as her career while needlework was her outlet for relaxation and a ‚Äúkind of calming medicine.‚ÄùRebecca Laroche, Medical Authority and Englishwomen‚Äôs Herbal Texts 1550-1650, 130. She was a very intellectual and knowledgeable woman in many areas, not limited her knowledge to religion. Julie Eckerle mentions that Elizabeth was strikingly independent in all matters, from poetry, ballads, and herbals to playing cards and reading romances.Julie A. Eckerle, ‚ÄúComing to Knowledge: Elizabeth Isham‚Äôs Autobiography and the Self-Construction of an Intellectual Woman,‚Äù 113. Elizabeth was an extraordinary woman of her time not just being a single Christian woman, but an intellectual Christian single woman.Julie A. Eckerle, ‚ÄúComing to Knowledge: Elizabeth Isham‚Äôs Autobiography and the Self-Construction of an Intellectual Woman,‚Äù 114.

From there, his free black servants brought runaway slaves to awaiting boats on Waukegan Harbour, giving the impression that they were doing business for James Cory.

Cory was an American photographer, painter, muralist, and sculptor.Petteys, Chris, Dictionary of Women Artists, G K Hill & Co. publishers, 1985 She made her living as a commercial artist, contributing drawings to Recreation magazine and was involved with New York's Pen and Brush Club. Beginning in 1895, Cory partnered with potter Charles Volkmar to create hand-painted plaques, cups and plates of historic people, like William Penn and Alexander Hamilton. Buildings figured in the designs, such as George Washington's headquarters. The works were painted in blue, primarily by Cory. Their shop, Volkmar and Cory Pottery, was located in Corona in Queens, New York. In 1903 Volkmar opened a pottery business in Metuchen, New Jersey called Charles Volkmar & Son.Edwin Atlee Barber. Marks of American Potters. Patterson & White Company; 1904. pp. 82‚Äì83. Hopi villages 1905-1912 At the Pen and Brush Club, Cory met artist Louis Akin, who had just returned from the Southwest. He had made paintings of the Hopi Indians to promote tourism along the Santa Fe Railroad route. Her interest in the western United States had been sparked by Ernest Seton and when Akin told her of his plans to begin an artists' colony in Northern Arizona in 1905, Cory booked passage on a train to Canyon Diablo, Arizona, and then traveled north 65 miles through the desert to the high mesa of the Hopi reservation.Patricia Trenton; Sandra D'Emilio; Autry Museum of Western Heritage. Independent Spirits: Women Painters of the American West, 1890-1945. University of California Press; 1995. . p. 133. She intended to visit the Hopi mesas where Akin intended to establish an artist colony for a couple of months of a tour of the western United States. When she got off the train she realized that she was the lone art colonist. Except for periods in Canada and California (1909), from 1905 to 1912 Cory lived among the Hopi at Oraibi and Walpi.Opitz, Glenn B., Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors & Engravers, Apollo Books, Poughkeepsie, NY, 1988 In Oraibi she lived at the top of a Hopi pueblo, her space rented to her by a Hopi friend, that she accessed via stone steps and ladders.Stewart B. Koyiyumptewa; Carolyn O'Bagy Davis. The Hopi People. Arcadia Publishing; 2009. . p. 41. She was the only women brought into the secret life and practices of the Hopis. Cory learned the Hopi language, wrote about Hopi grammar, and mediated a disturbance.\\"Many and Varieties of Activities of Women: Working among the Indians.\\" Atlanta Constitution Magazine Section. December 15, 1915. While there, she painted the landscape and the Hopi people. She also took about 600 photographs, recording virtually all aspects of Hopi life, social as well as sacred. She took posed portraits, photographs of ceremonies and images of individuals, \\"which suggest a warm and spontaneous relationship\\". Her pictures depicted a traditional Hopi way of life on the precipice of having to assimilate or adapt to modern white America. Cory left the Hopi villages in 1912 and her viewpoints on life changed as a result of her relationships with the Hopi people, including eschewing modern consumerism.Susan Bernardin.

She was not the first to photograph the Hopi; however, due to her intimacy with the culture, she was able to capture a more personal view than earlier photographers. She didn't sell her photographs, but would use them as illustrations for her essays, like Life and Its Living in Hopiland - The Hopi Women, which was published in a magazine in 1909. The same year she received an Honorable Mention for a painting exhibited at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exhibition in Seattle. In 1915 the Smithsonian Institution bought 25 of the paintings Cory made during the time that she lived with the Hopis. Prescott She moved to Prescott, Arizona in 1913 and lived in a stone house built and furnished by Hopi workers. Cory exhibited a painting, Arizona Desert, at the Armory Show of 1913 which sold for $150,Brown, Milton W., The Story of the Armory Show, The Joseph H. Hirshhorn Foundation, 1963, p. 232 and received an honorable mention at the show.Michael Leja. Looking Askance: Skepticism and American Art from Eakins to Duchamp. University of California Press; 1 March 2007. . p. 222. Because of declining attendance at the Prescott Rodeo, Cory helped a group of local men calling themselves \\"Smoki\\" (pronounced Smoke-eye) with information about Hopi ceremonies that they performed. When the Smoki grew large enough to need a permanent facility and a museum, Cory assisted with the design and decoration of the buildings. She also painted her largest paintings for display in the Smoki Museum, where they still hang. In her earnest intention to avoid living a wasteful life, she became known in Prescott for being eccentric. Fellow church members offered to replace her torn and tattered clothes. She was frugal, but gave away two cabins she owned to renters. She removed debris from rain water and used it to develop photographs. Rather than sell her paintings, she bartered them. She was described as having had \\"a plain, weather-beaten face, pulled-back hair, a determined black-clothed walk with a cane, as if every trip downtown were aimed at confronting the mayor.\\"John Weston.

Not knowing how to preserve the negatives, the museum gave them to the Museum of Northern Arizona, who was better equipped to maintain and preserve the images. Marc Gaede, director of photography at the museum, Marnie Gaede and Barton Wright created the book The Hopi Photographs: Kate Cory: 1905-1912 based on some of the found images, some of which are ceremonial scenes.

At eight years of age he became the property of his white playmate, James Grandy, and two years later he was hired out for work. The monies Moses earned were collected and held until James Grandy turned 21. Moses helped build the Great Dismal Swamp Canal and learned how to navigate boats. It was that skill that led him to be made commander of several boats that traveled the canal and Pasquotank River, transporting merchandise from Elizabeth City, North Carolina, to Norfolk, Virginia. The position allowed him to be better fed, shod, and dressed. Able to keep a portion of his earnings, Moses arranged to buy his freedom twice and twice his owners kept the money and held him in slavery. An arrangement was made for an honorable man to buy him and Grandy earned the money to buy his freedom a third time, this time successfully. In the course of his life he had witnessed beatings and sales of family members, including his first bride only eight months after their marriage. Once he obtained his freedom, he worked to make the money to free his wife and children. He was able to secure the release of his wife and 15-year-old son. He dictated a narrative of his life, Narrative of the Life of Moses Grandy, Late a Slave in the United States of America, with the intention of buying the freedom of additional family members. His slave narrative and others, read in the United States and overseas, helped to bring awareness of slavery and fuel the abolitionist movement.  Early life  In the late 1700s, Moses Grandy was born in Camden County, North Carolina, into slavery. He was owned by Billy Grandy and raised with his children. When he was about eight years old, Moses was inherited by James Grandy, his playmate of the same age, who was his deceased master's son. His family was separated when his siblings and father were sold. His mother hid some of her children at times to prevent them from being sold. Among the people that Grandy witnessed being beaten were his mother, a pregnant women, and a 12-year-old boy, who was beaten until he died. He was subject to beatings, and not having enough to eat, he was also half- starved.Sobel. Teach Me Dreams (2002), p. 127.  Enslaved life  Grandy was hired out by James Grandy when he was 10. The second man he worked for, Jeremy Coate, beat him so severely for not hilling corn as he wanted it that the sapling broke off in his side. Enoch Sawyer, an owner of large tracts of land in Pasquotank and Camden counties, fed him so little that Grandy ground cornhusks into flour for food. By 15 he was managing ferry crossings of a swampy river in Camden, North Carolina, at Sawyer's Ferry (later Lamb's Ferry);Lambs Ferry and the Floating Road. Camden County, North Carolina.

Great Dismal Swamp Canal Grandy worked jobs transporting goods to Portsmouth and Norfolk, Virginia, and running boats and cutting timber for the Great Dismal Swamp Canal. Although well-skilled at managing craft on the river, he also worked for a time as field hand and a look-out for his gambling boss. Several bosses after Sawyer, Grandy worked for a man named Richard Furley who allowed Grandy to take on extra work, working nights and Sundays, taking a share of the receipts. James Grandy called in all the slaves he had rented out to others and allowed Grandy to continue doing extra work, but took twice as much as Furley's percentage of the receipts. Over the years, Grandy studied navigation and other jobs that were assigned to him, so that he was proficient and valuable. A strong, tall man, he worked hard, long hours. He was thoughtful about his actions to avoid worsening his situation; he would not be a runaway or a rebel. Grandy was keenly aware that his success would be more likely to be secured by alliance with an honorable man. In the winter of 1813, James Grandy's brother-in-law and a merchant, Charles Grice, approached him to hire 21-year-old Moses out as a freightboat captain. He became commander, ultimately Captain Moses Grandy, of up to four boats that navigated and transported goods on the Great Dismal Swamp Canal and the difficult, curvy Pasquotank River, the only navigable waterways between Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and Norfolk, Virginia, once the British closed off Chesapeake Bay in the War of 1812. Underclothed and underfed, once he started working for Grice and Norfolk merchant Moses Myers, he had better food, shoes, and a coat. His pay was now based on the value of the successfully transported merchandise.Simpson.

It is this type of method that was used when he saw his wife being taken away from him. Grandy \\"married\\" a woman (enslaved people could not marry legally), who he said he loved \\"as I loved my life\\". She lived on a plantation and one day as he was poling a boat through the river he heard a woman call his name. He saw his wife in a slave coffle as she was being walked to a boat that would take her south and away from him. Disconcerted, he lost his grip on the pole and fell into the water. She called out \\"I am gone.\\" Grandy made it to shore to learn that her former owner was in need of money and thus sold some of his slaves, and, at gunpoint, that there was nothing Grandy could do to change that inevitability. They had been \\"married\\" eight months, were settling well into marriage, and she may have been pregnant. They never saw each other again.Calvin Schermerhorn.

A late 19th-century depiction of slaves in the Great Dismal Swamp First, he made installments to James Grandy, for which he received receipts, towards the $600 to buy his freedom. After the final payment was made, and within eyesight of the courthouse, James Grandy asked for the receipts in exchange for his signature on the papers to free him. Moses gave him the receipts. Grandy tore up the receipts and rather than walk towards the courthouse, he went to the tavern to drink.Simpson. Two Captains from Carolina (2012), pp. 15-.

That having failed, other whites reacted by having him removed from the boarding house he lived in. Moses, owned now by Trewitt and having lost his savings, was hired out again. Trewitt kept a share of the money Moses earned and Moses Grandy again saved another $600. When he had saved up what Trewitt demanded to buy his freedom, Trewitt took the money, but did not free him. Grandy went into a deep depression. His owner threatened to sell him, which would mean he would be separated from his second \\"wife\\". At the thought of being separated again from a loved one, he said in desperation, \\"I would cut my throat from ear to ear rather than go with him.\\" His owner, realizing the financial impact of such a measure, withdrew the offer to sell him. Ironically, one of the most brutal slave overseers, a Mr. Brooks, was outraged by the second time in which Grandy's money was taken without securing his freedom. He notified Grandy that a man, Edward Minner, might be able to help secure his freedom. Grandy recounted the experiences he had to a white man he believed to be honorable, Edward Minner, who agreed to buy him for $650 and have him earn back the price of the sale to obtain his freedom.  Freedom  Having papers that proved he was free, at Minner's suggestion he moved to Providence, Rhode Island. Within two months he missed his family and returned to North Carolina and obtained work to earn the freedom of his family. Minner died one year later and Grandy returned to the safer North to earn the money for their freedom. While there, he earned the affection of people who found \\"his benevolence, affection, kindness of heart, and elasticity of spirit...truly remarkable,\\" according to abolitionist George Thompson. To earn the money for their freedom, he recounted his life story, including the emotional and physical torment, which was published and sold. To fellow African Americans he stated his beliefs that the whites who had harmed his family and other slaves would face judgment of God in the afterlife.Mechal Sobel.

Grandy worked in coal yards, sawed wood, and took cargo on and off vessels. Then he had a position on the ship James Murray as a seaman. There he earned the same pay as white sailors, which was about $16 per month (). The position provided stability in that room and board was provided for him, the term of employment was virtually guaranteed for the length of a voyage, and he made more money than he would likely have made on land.

Abolitionist and author  Grandy believed that abolitionists in the United States, England, and Ireland (at that time not an independent country) were important in the fight to abolish slavery. In 1842, he traveled to London to help the abolitionist cause by providing a firsthand account of the cruelties of slavery in the United States. As he was \\"perfectly illiterate\\", he dictated his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Moses Grandy, Late a Slave in the United States of America, to fellow abolitionist George Thompson, according to an introductory letter of the latter, and it was published in 1843. The purpose of the book, according to its title page, was to obtain the money to buy his remaining children and other family members. A second edition was printed the following year.Yuval Taylor.

The bout took place at The Mirage in Paradise, Nevada, USA and saw Douglas making the first defense of the titles he won from Mike Tyson in February 1990. Background After becoming the first boxer in history to win all three major sanctioning organizations' world titles in the cruiserweight division, Evander Holyfield decided to move up in class and take on the top heavyweights. In his first fight at heavyweight he defeated James Tillis by knockout and then knocked out former champion Pinklon Thomas before the year was out. Shortly after that Holyfield became regarded as the #1 contender to Mike Tyson, who was the undisputed champion of the division and who in 1988 won the lineal championship from Michael Spinks. A match between the two was signed for June 18, 1990, and Tyson elected to take a tuneup fight on February 11, 1990, against fringe contender James \\"Buster\\" Douglas in Tokyo. Despite having been regarded as a top contender for the title in the past, Douglas' reputation was as a lazy, out of shape fighter who did not pay much attention to his training. As a result, most casinos didn't even bother to make odds for the fight. The only one that did so, The Mirage, installed Tyson as a 42-1 favorite. Douglas was not given much chance to last against him. Not only had Tyson never been defeated, but he had only gone the distance four times in his career and had not gone past the fifth round with an opponent since Tyrell Biggs took him to the seventh round in 1987. Douglas, however, had other plans and subjected a stunned champion to a severe pounding. Tyson was so unprepared that his corner did not bring proper equipment to the fight, with no ice bag or endswell, and was forced to use a latex glove filled with water to try to reduce the swelling to his eye. Despite being knocked down in the eighth round, Douglas bounced back and knocked Tyson out in the tenth round to claim the title in what was called by Jim Lampley, broadcasting the fight for HBO, as \\"the single biggest upset in the history of heavyweight championship fights.\\" The fight was not without controversy, however, as Tyson's promoter Don King, claimed that referee Octavio Meyran had not properly counted the knockdown on Douglas from the eighth round (saying that Douglas was down for ten seconds and not the eight count he received), and that the result should be reversed and Tyson should instead be declared the winner. The WBA and WBC initially agreed with King and announced that they would not recognize Douglas as champion until they reviewed the allegations, though the IBF accepted the result as valid.Boxing Officials Could Overturn Defeat of Tyson, N.Y.

Holyfield, meanwhile, would earn $8,025,000.Record Jackpot for Douglas, N.Y. Times article, 1990-06-11, Retrieved on 2013-05-13 Pioneering Television Sales Casino mogul Steve Wynn, then chairman of the Mirage Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, hosted the Douglas-Holyfield fight and made an unprecedented move to manage the television pay-per-view and international sales through his own organization with the help of individual consultants with expertise. Typically the pay-per-view rights were sold to local US cable operators via either Showtime or HBO, and international rights were sold through the champion's promoter. Wynn hired Mike Trainer, known best for his work as attorney for Sugar Ray Leonard to distribute the international rights directly for the Mirage, and sought out an entrepreneurial television producer who would produce the manage and arrange distribution to over 100 countries around the world. He selected Alexis Denny, formerly of ABC Sports and CBS News, and who had been one of the only people in sports television to work on all 3 Leonard- Duran fights, boxing's most well-known trilogy of the 80s. Denny set up a distribution plan for providing interviews and training footage, in addition to other promotional material on behalf of the Mirage, to broadcasters on every continent, including major rights holders in the United Kingdom, Japan, Brazil, Germany, Australia and more. From a business perspective, the rights fees earned and the reviews of the international production created by Denny and Wynn were a big success. The fight itself, however, proved more disappointing. The fight An out-of-shape Douglas came into the fight weighing 246 pounds, 15 pounds heavier than he was for the Tyson fight. Holyfield, meanwhile came into the fight at a lean and fit 208 pounds and dominated the sluggish Douglas, winning both the first and second rounds. In the third round, Douglas attempted to hit Holyfield with an uppercut. Not only did Douglas telegraph the punch, he missed Holyfield completely and knocked himself off balance. Holyfield countered with a straight right to Douglas' chin, knocking the champion flat on his back as referee Mills Lane counted him out. Douglas remained on the canvas for several seconds after the knockout and needed to be helped up twice before he got to his corner. Aftermath Douglas was heavily criticised for both his excessive weight gain and his lackluster in-ring performance.All He Needed Was a Mask and Gun, L.A. Times article, 1990-10-26, Retrieved on 2013-05-13 His former promoter King was particularly critical, shooting down any chance of a Douglas‚ÄìTyson rematch while also calling Douglas' performance \\"disgraceful\\".No Tyson-Douglas Rematch Planned, King Says, L.A. Times article, 1990-10-29, Retrieved on 2013-05-13 Douglas left boxing after this, not to return until 1996. He won the first six fights of his comeback before being knocked out in the first round by Lou Savarese. He won his next two fights before retiring for good in 1999. Holyfield's first defense of his title came on April 19, 1991, against former heavyweight champion George Foreman, who was returning from retirement, in Atlantic City. After Holyfield defeated Foreman by decision, the long awaited match between Holyfield and Tyson, who defeated Donovan Ruddock in two fights for the #1 contendership to the title, was signed for November 8, 1991, in Las Vegas. However, an injury and Tyson's subsequent arrest and incarceration for raping Desiree Washington scuttled these plans. Holyfield instead fought Bert Cooper on November 23, 1991, in his hometown of Atlanta and knocked him out in the seventh round. Holyfield made one more defense of his title, against another former champion out of retirement in Larry Holmes, in June 1992, before losing to Riddick Bowe in November 1992. Holyfield regained the WBA and IBF titles from Bowe in a 1993 rematch, losing them to Michael Moorer in 1994. After a brief retirement due to a misdiagnosed heart condition, Holyfield returned to the ring and upset WBA champion Tyson in a November 1996 fight to become only the second (after Muhammad Ali) fighter to win a heavyweight title three times. He defeated Tyson in their 1997 rematch, then followed it with a defeat of Moorer in a rematch to reclaim the IBF title. After losing his titles in a unification fight with Lennox Lewis in 1999, Holyfield won his fourth heavyweight title by defeating John Ruiz for the WBA title in 2000. He promptly lost the title in his next fight against Ruiz, and after a draw in their third match, Holyfield largely faded away from the title scene.

He made his debut as a cinematographer in 1957 with the film I colpevoli by Turi Vasile, in which he experienced an innovative camera system, with the simultaneous use of three cameras to frame different cuts of long shots. After having accompanied Giuseppe Rotunno as an additional cinematographer in The Great War (1959), in the early sixties he worked in art films such as Damiano Damiani's Arturo's Island and The Empty Canvas, but also to international co-productions such as Madame Sans-Gene by Christian-Jaque and The Condemned of Altona by Vittorio De Sica. In the second half of the sixties Gerardi turned into literary adaptations such as Mademoiselle De Maupin by Mauro Bolognini and Don Giovanni in Sicilia by Alberto Lattuada. He was also pretty active in sophisticated commedia all'italiana films, in which he adopted a distinctive cinematography, characterized by \\"a brilliant use of color and light\\". The seventies marked the beginning of the decline of his career, that started to be orientated to more popular and less ambitious productions; during these years he regularly worked with the directors Fernando Di Leo and Giorgio Capitani.

The battalion fought during Operation Silver Fox which was a combined German and Finnish offensive attempting to capture the Soviet port of Murmansk. The unit was disbanded after this operation due to their outdated equipment. Formation After the fall of France in June 1940 the Germans captured a large amount of French vehicles. Among those were 297 (varying according to sources) Somua S35 which was considered by many to be the premier medium tank at the beginning of the war. In addition to the SOMUA S35s there were around 550 Hotchkiss H35 and H38 tanks captured as well. The Germans used these captured vehicles to equip several smaller units which were then combined into Panzer-Abteilung 211 on 22 March 1941. Operation Silver Fox The Soviet port of Murmansk was a high-value target for German command in 1941. On 27 June 1941 they began Operation Silver Fox to capture the key port, Panzer-Abteilung 211 was tasked with supporting the combined German and Finnish force along with Panzer-Abteilung 40 which was equipped with Panzer I and Panzer II tanks.

She previously served four terms in the Florida House of Representatives from 2010 until her election to the Senate. History Berman was born in New York City, New York, moved to the state of Florida in 1958, and later attended Tufts University, where she graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 1980. Afterwards, she attended the George Washington University Law School, graduating in 1983. She returned to Florida, and, years later, attended the University of Miami Law School, where she received a Master of Laws with a specialty in estate planning in 2002. While working as an attorney in South Florida, Berman became active in politics, working for the congressional campaigns of former Congressman Robert Wexler and in his congressional office. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Maria Sachs opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, Berman ran to succeed her in the Democratic primary in the 86th District, which stretched from Hypoluxo to Boca Raton in eastern Palm Beach County. She defeated her only opponent, Carole Penny Kaye, in a landslide, receiving 79% of the vote. In the general election, Berman was unopposed and won her first term uncontested. In 2012, when the Florida House districts were reconfigured, Berman was redistricted into the 90th District, which included most of the territory that she had previously represented. She won the nomination of her party unopposed, and in the general election, faced Republican nominee Sean Michael Kasper. The Palm Beach Post endorsed Berman for re-election, praising her for having \\"an impact in a GOP-dominated legislature,\\" despite adhering \\"too much to liberal party doctrine.\\" The South Florida Sun-Sentinel concurred, criticizing Kasper for \\"his lack of understanding...the issues facing lawmakers and the basics of...the legislative process,\\" but endorsing Berman for her \\"decent record of representing county residents in Tallahassee.\\" She ended up defeating Kasper in a landslide, receiving 68% of the vote to his 32%. While serving in the legislature, Berman joined with fellow State Representative Janet Cruz to propose legislation that would ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in the state of Florida. Berman also sponsored legislation that would \\"impose background checks on all gun purchasers,\\" but it did not pass in the 2013 legislative session. In 2014, Berman was re-elected to her third term in the legislature without opposition. She was re-elected to a fourth term in 2016, defeating a Libertarian Party candidate 79.5 to 20.5%.  Florida Senate  In 2017, State Senator Jeff Clemens resigned after admitting to an extramarital affair with a lobbyist, creating a vacancy in his central Palm Beach County district. Berman ran in the special election to fill the seat, resigning her House seat the day before the general election to do so. She defeated Tami Donnally, the vice chair of the Palm Beach County Republican Party, 75 to 25%.

Relations between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the natives of the Pacific Island groups of Polynesia, Melanesia, Micronesia and surrounding island groups are quite complex. History Entrance to the Polynesian Cultural Center. The Pacific islands were one of the first areas to be evangelised after Europe and North America, notably Hawaii, which fell under American influence and was annexed by the USA quite early on. On November 27, 1919, the Laie Hawaii Temple was the first temple outside the continental United States and also the first in Polynesia. In 1955, the church began ordaining Melanesians to the priesthood, and on September 26, the Church College of Hawaii was established. The church had always allowed Pacific Islanders to hold the priesthood, and church president David O. McKay clarified that native Fijians and Australian Aboriginals could also be ordained to the priesthood. Hagoth In addition to the LDS Church's stories about people sailing to the New World, there is also the story of Hagoth, who it is said to have sailed from the Americas to Polynesia. But while the stories of Lehi and Jared are generally accepted, that of Hagoth is more ambiguous and not universally supported by practising church members, and not at all by non-members of the church. Differentiating between scriptural and apocryphal accounts of Hagoth and his ships, one Latter-day Saint writer makes the following observations: > The Book of Mormon does not equate the \\"west sea\\" with the Pacific Ocean. > The Book of Mormon does not tell us that Hagoth was on board any of the > ships that were lost. Scripture does not say that he captained a vessel or > that he was an explorer or an adventurer, or that he led people. For all we > can tell, the skilled Hagoth's main objective was to profit from the > shipping industry. It is possible for peoples in various places to be > related to Hagoth's people (the Nephites) without Hagoth personally making > an ocean voyage. Coastal and Island hopping colonies, once associated with > Nephite shipping, could have built more vessels and traveled very far. It is > also important to realize that the peoples of the Pacific islands may have > come from more than one direction.Coon, W. Vincent, Q & A, ‚ÄúHagoth‚Äôs Lost > Ships!‚Äù; additionally, Coon notes that the scriptural use of the term > \\"curious\\" may mean \\"accomplished with skill and ingenuity\\" and does not > necessarily imply an inclination for adventure. Non-scriptural sources suggest that Hagoth led an expedition, sailing into the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Leaders of the LDS ChurchR. Lanier Britsch stated in the New Era, \\"Since the days of George Q. Cannon in Hawaii (1851‚Äì54), the Church leaders had more and more frequently alluded to the idea that the Polynesians were descendants of Lehi, the early Book Of Mormon prophet. Although the relationship between the Polynesian peoples and the alleged \\"adventurer\\" Hagoth (see Alma 63:5‚Äì8) is not clear‚Äîhe being a Nephite and the Polynesians appearing to be Lamanites‚ÄîChurch leaders have time and time again referred to the Polynesians as children of Lehi.\\" - R. Lanier Britsch, \\"Maori Traditions and the Mormon Church\\", New Era, June 1981. and scholars have stated that the peoples of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Polynesia, and New Zealand, are descendants of the Nephite Hagoth and his supposed followers. According to the Book of Mormon, the Nephites were descendants of Israel. Many members of the LDS Church in Polynesia have come to believe that Hagoth is their ancestor.For one Mormon artist's portrayal of Polynesian people as the \\"Children of Hagoth\\", see \\"A Worldwide Look at the Book of Mormon, Liahona, December 2000. For an example of Hagoth being regarded as a \\"hero\\" by Polynesian Mormon youth, see Kathleen C. Perrin, ‚ÄúTahitian Pearls,‚Äù, Liahona, June 1994. Folklore TƒÅwhiao Some of the folklore that exits in the relationship of the LDS Church and Pacific Islanders include: * that TƒÅwhiao accurately predicted the site of the 1958 Hamilton New Zealand Temple before his death in 1894; * that MƒÅori prophets or chieftains, including Paora Te Potangaroa and TƒÅwhiao, predicted the coming of Latter-day Saint missionaries to New Zealand;Matthew Cowley, \\"\\"Maori Chief Predicts Coming of L.D.S.

The Original Rossi's Ice Cream is located at 12‚Äì14 Western Esplanade, Southend-on- Sea. The Original Rossi ice cream company was brought to Southend on Sea in 1931 by Massimiliano Agostino Rossi, known as Agostino, and his wife Anna. His first shop was at 37 High Street Southend on Sea. By 1932 he had opened shops at 1 Marine Parade and 12-14 Western Esplanade. In 1937 he was joined by his wife's cousin Pietro Rossi who took over the running of the shops at Marine Parade and Western Esplanade. Meanwhile, Massimiliano opened another shop at 99 Southend High Street. Rossi's Ices is also located at 92 The Esplanade, Weymouth, facing Weymouth Bay. It was founded in 1937 by an Italian immigrant, Fioravanti Figliolini and has remained open continuously apart from a brief period during World War II. The premises feature original 1930s decor and were Grade II listed in 1997 as part of the Royal Arcade. Rossi Ice cream (Southend-on-Sea) Ltd is stated on companies house as being owned by Michael & Colin Gray who purchased The Original Rossi Ice Cream in 2007. History In the 1920s, Fioravanti Fioravanti immigrated with his brother Peter and his wife Pasqua to England from Cant√π, Lombardy, north of Milan in Italy. They initially traded as the Figliolini Brothers in Newcastle upon Tyne, before joining forces with Toni Rossi another immigration entrepreneur. In 1937, they were looking for new premises and decided to establish another ice cream parlour in the Royal Arcade at Weymouth, in four old shops. Fioravanti eventually took over the franchise from Toni Rossi but remained trading under 'Rossi's'. He set up his own ice cream parlour \\"Rossi's\\" on The Esplanade at Weymouth. In popular culture In 2012, to coincide with the 2012 Olympics that featured sailing events in Weymouth Bay, the establishment was included in the Weymouth version of the Monopoly board game.

She was a member of the second subgroup of the class, and saw service during much of World War II. She later served in the Royal Danish Navy as HDMS Valdemar Sejr (F 343). Construction and commissioning The ship was ordered under the 1939 War Emergency Build Programme from Swan Hunter, Wallsend, on 20 December 1939. She was laid down as Job Number J4190 as Burton on 7 June 1940 and launched on 12 March 1941. While she was fitting out, she was renamed Exmoor in June 1941 after the loss that year of the previous .

Service history Atlantic, 1941 Upon commissioning, Exmoor immediately began acceptance trials. Upon their successful completion later in October, she steamed to Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, where she performed work-ups with ships of the Home Fleet. After completing work-ups in November 1941, she was selected for patrol and convoy escort duties at Gibraltar, but before taking up those responsibilities she steamed to Derry - also known as Londonderry - in Northern Ireland and on 13 November 1941 joined her sister ship and the destroyers and as escort of the military convoy WS12Z while it transited the Western Approaches. She was detached from the convoy on 17 November 1941. In December 1941 Exmoor steamed to Gibraltar, where she reported to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla - which also included her sister ships and - for duty. On 14 December 1941 she deployed to reinforce the escort of Convoy HG76, which was under heavy attack by German submarines in the North Atlantic Ocean. On 17 December 1941, she joined Blankney, the destroyer , the corvette , the sloop , and a Grumman Martlet aircraft from the Fleet Air Arms 802 Naval Air Squadron aboard the escort aircraft carrier in a depth-charge attack which forced the German submarine to the surface, where she was sunk by gunfire northeast of Madeira, Portugal, at position . On 18 December 1941, Exmoor was detached from the convoy and returned to Gibraltar. Mediterranean, 1942 In January 1942 Exmoor transferred to the 37th Destroyer Division, with responsibility for antisubmarine patrols and convoy defence in the North Atlantic Ocean and western Mediterranean Sea.

In 1347, Robert de Staunton as lord of the manor, obtained a grant of a Wednesday market at Staunton and a fair for four days at the feast of St James, but by the 17th century the earlier prosperity of Staunton had disappeared. At the end of the 18th century cider and perry were produced in large quantities at Staunton, but because the soil produced good crops of wheat, beans and barley, the cidermaking industry died out. The church of Saint James was originally a 12th-century church with short rectangular chancel and aisleless nave, the chancel afterwards being rebuilt and the tower and aisle added in later years. The nave windows are all of 14th-century type, apparently copies or restorations of work of that period, and the tower and spire are of late 14th-century date with a later west window. The church was heavily restored in 1860, when the chancel was rebuilt and the vestry added.

The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) decides to pursue a career as a professional actor, and quits his job at Dunder Mifflin. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) finally receives his black belt in karate from his new sensei (Imperioli) and, on the recommendation of Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), is promoted to Regional Manager of the Scranton branch. Jim reconnects with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and makes it clear that he will choose her over Philadelphia. The episode was viewed by an estimated and received a 1.8/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking third in its first half-hour timeslot and fourth in its second, marking a slight increase in the ratings from the previous episode. \\"Livin' the Dream\\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Critical praise mainly went towards the dynamic between Jim, Pam and Dwight, particularly for the former two's reconciliation and the latter's promotion. Andy's subplot, meanwhile, received more mixed reviews.  Synopsis  CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) plans to fire Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) due to his missing work for acting gigs. However, Andy tells David he is resigning to pursue his dreams of stardom full-time, and David is relieved to not have to dismiss him. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) finally receives his black belt in karate from his new sensei, Billy (Michael Imperioli). Seeing Dwight's tenacity and devotion, David is inspired to make Dwight Andy's replacement. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) has returned to Scranton full-time, saying he has realized that he cannot devote himself to both his family and his new job, and has decided to go \\"all in\\" on his family since that is what makes him most happy. David asks Jim his opinion on promoting Dwight, and Jim says that, despite Dwight's various eccentricities, he deserves the job and will be a great manager. Dwight is elated that he has accomplished his dream; proudly exclaiming the news to the office. He appoints Jim the new assistant to the regional manager. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) informs Jim that Athlead has found a buyer and wants them to do a promotional tour around the country for three months. With undisguised regret, Jim says he will not do the tour because he cannot put his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) through that, unaware that Pam is listening in. Everyone in the office tells Andy that quitting is a foolish move and he has no chance of achieving stardom. Andy eventually goes back on his decision, and David allows him to stay on in a sales position. However, mere hours later Andy feels that he is sticking with his Dundler-Mifflin job only because it is safe and that he has to take a shot at achieving fame. Fearing his conviction will falter a second time, he decides he cannot simply quit, but get fired. To do this, he initially tells Toby (Paul Lieberstein) to enter falsified and incriminating information in Andy's record. After this fails, he attempts to grope Toby. Andy eventually resorts to shouting obscenities at David and defecating on his car, which is successful at getting him fired. Andy bids farewell to his coworkers with an unexpectedly moving rendition of \\"I Will Remember You\\", prompting them to comment to the documentary crew that he may have star potential after all. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) had gotten divorced, and is evicted from her studio apartment after her cats were taken away by Animal Control. She considers living in a tent in the woods, prompting Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to offer her to stay with him until she gets back on her feet. She accepts with gratitude. As they set off to take Angela's things to Oscar's place, Oscar mentions her marriage to Robert Lipton and she breaks down into tears, saying \\"I love him.\\" However, she denies she still has feelings for Robert and confesses she was talking about Dwight. Production alt= \\"Livin' the Dream\\" was written by story editor Niki Schwartz-Wright, marking her second writing credit for the series, after the earlier season episode \\"Lice\\". It was directed by regular Office director Jeffrey Blitz, who last directed season eight's \\"Gettysburg\\". The episode was originally scheduled to air in its regular half-hour time slot, but NBC later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot beginning a half hour early, although it still counts as one official episode, similar to the earlier season episode \\"Moving On\\". Rogers noted that \\"we knew the last two episodes would be hour-longs, and The Finale might even end up running longer, but we still had a lot of great storytelling to do leading up to them, and 'Livin' the Dream' was one that ultimately deserved to be an hour long episode as well!\\" Reception Ratings \\"Livin' the Dream\\" originally aired on May 2, 2013 on NBC. In its original American broadcast, \\"Livin' the Dream\\" was viewed by an estimated 3.51 million viewers and received a 1.8 rating/5% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 1.8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a slight increase in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Paper Airplane\\". The episode ranked third in its first half-hour timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men which received a 3.2/10 rating and an entry of the Fox reality series American Idol which scored a 2.6/9 rating. The second half-hour ranked fourth in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which scored a 3.0/9 rating, an entry of the CBS series Person of Interest which garnered a 2.4/7 rating, and installment of the Fox series Glee which received a 1.9/5 rating. Reviews \\"Livin' the Dream\\" received positive reviews from television critics. Roth Cornet of IGN wrote that \\"it pleases me greatly that at the conclusion of this super-sized episode I was left, once again, truly looking forward to seeing what these next few weeks, and that final hour of The Office, will bring.\\" Cornet praised the full-use of the ensemble, particularly the \\"Phyllis and Stanley Lil' Romeo mini-debate\\" and Creed's confused mimicking of Dwight's declaration. Cornet also called the Dwight storyline \\"perfectly executed\\", as well as the Jim-Pam-Dwight dynamic featured throughout the episode, calling their companionship to be \\"entirely earned\\". She also praised Kinsey's performance during her character's storyline, and said her final scenes with Oscar \\"[tugged] at my heart-string\\". She gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10, calling it \\"Great\\". M. Giant of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\" and wrote that \\"almost everybody is having their best day in a long time, in the best episode of The Office in an even longer time\\". Nick Campbell of TV.com complimented the sentimental storylines in the episode, specifically between Jim, Pam and Dwight. He was positive towards Jim and Pam's reconciliation, but felt \\"something hollow about their reunion\\". He also noted that the Jim-Pam storyline caused the Dwight-Angela relationship to go \\"darker\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a slightly more mixed review writing that \\"the non- Andy parts of \\"Livin' the Dream\\" were fairly interesting\\". He appreciated the drama coming from Angela's desperation, despite disagreeing with the logic in the situation. Sepinwall praised the Jim-Dwight dynamic in the episode, considering it an enjoyable payoff, and also praised Jim and Pam's reconciliation, particularly them annoying their co-workers with their flirting. Joshua Alton of The A.V. Club was more negative towards the episode, saying it felt \\"padded-out\\" to fill the full hour timeslot, and that \\"this episode might be the nadir for the show's hour-long installments\\". He was complimentary towards the Jim-Pam storyline, but felt \\"there wasn't much happening\\" beyond Pam overhearing Jim's talk with Darryl. Alton praised the Dwight storyline and his dynamic with Jim and Pam, calling it \\"the true fan service\\". Alton gave the episode a \\"C‚Äì\\".

A residual of the company persisted in Arizona as a flight school and charter business, operating out of Gilpin Field in Tucson, Arizona for several years. The airline is notable for its ownership by Arizona pioneer and politician Isabella Greenway, and for its involvement with trans-border traffic during the days of Prohibition. History Gilpin Air Lines emerged from the Depression-related failure of a California busline turned airline, Pickwick Airways, bought by Charles William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Gilpin in 1929. He had been one of Pickwick‚Äôs pilots, and the new outfit operated most of the same airplanes. Pickwick Airways was part of the San Francisco-based Pickwick Corporation, owner of the Pickwick Hotel. Gilpin, who learned to fly during World War I, had been an associate of Mrs. Greenway, Arizona‚Äôs first Congresswoman and owner of far-flung business interests in the state. As the airline was increasingly unprofitable, Greenway invested in it and eventually became the owner, thus the G & G moniker. At the time of Greenway‚Äôs take-over, the airline had about thirty employees, with G. L. Slaybaugh was the general manager. Greenway used the airline much for personal and business travel, especially in her political campaigns in the thinly populated state. Gilpin often acted as her pilot. He had been chauffeur for Greenway‚Äôs deceased husband, and is recorded as flying numerous flights in the Southwest in the 1926-30 timespan, including in an aircraft of his own design and manufacture.http://www.dmairfield.org Bill Gilpin was killed in a weather- related accident near Toluca, Mexico in July 1932, on a flight from San Diego to Mexico City. On 11 May 1933, Greenway appointed Elliott Roosevelt, the son of newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to be the airline‚Äôs manager. He was 22 years old and had no significant flying experience. The job was a favor to Greenway‚Äôs close friend Eleanor Roosevelt. The new manager served only a few weeks before abandoning the job, but attracted considerable press attention to the struggling outfit. Despite Elliott Roosevelt‚Äôs requests, the airline did not obtain the air mail contracts that were then essential for profitability. After his departure and the end of Prohibition, Greenway became convinced of the small airline‚Äôs unviability, and she closed it down in January 1934. However, she asked her godson, Walter Douglas, Jr. to continue to operate a flight school business with the name.Hansen, pp.40-56 Greenway's ownership of the airline and familiarity with aviation was a reason she, as the only Democrat, broke publicly with family friend President Franklin D. Roosevelt over the Air Mail Scandal of 1934. Equipment In May 1933, Gilpin Airlines had only five aircraft left: a single-engine, six-seat Fairchild Model 71; a small Ryan Model B-5; and, flying most of the route operations, three triple-engined Bach Air Yachts (models 3-CT-6 and 3-CT-8). In 1929, Pickwick Airways had owned six single-engine Ryans and a number of Bach Air Yachts.Isabella Greenway collection (below) and AAHS (below) Routes The predecessor Pickwick Airways operated from March 1929 to spring 1930 on a route network that originated in San Diego but extended as far as San Francisco and Guatemala. The Gilpin successor, headquartered in Glendale, California, operated several routes in the Southwest, including one between Palm Springs and Grand Central Air Terminal, Glendale near Los Angeles. However, the chief source of revenue came from a route between Los Angeles and Agua Caliente Racetrack, now in Tijuana city. During Prohibition, the Agua Caliente resort operated a casino, horse racing, and a resort hotel. The airline‚Äôs brochure stated a fare of $7.50 for this route, which included stops in San Diego and other locations as requested. The airline also operated charters in the Southwest. The accident in Toluca was a flight carrying James Crofton, the president of the Agua Caliente resort, along with his secret wife, actress Mona Rico, to meet with Mexican president Pascual Ortiz Rubio. Notable aviator Pancho Barnes flew for Pickwick, for publicity. In May 1933, the airline reported it had four pilots and nineteen employees. That month, the airline flew 155 revenue trips in 172 hours, carrying 482 passengers.Isabella Greenway collection (below) Legacy G & G Gilpin Air Lines continued after 1934 as a Tucson flight school home based on Tucson Municipal Field. In 1940, the operation moved to Gilpin Field, a new airfield along (what became) I-10 northwest of town. Isabella Greenway‚Äôs godson, Tucson aviation pioneer Walter Douglas, Jr. owned and operated the field and the now fixed-base operator Gilpin Air Lines. The business operated from a large hangar at this field. Gilpin Field later became municipal Freeway Airport (1959), which was closed in 1978.David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Runway Drive once handled aircraft,\\" Arizona Daily Star, July 3, 2012 Douglas also operated Grand Canyon Airlines. The Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson exhibits a Waco UPF-7 and a Fleet Model 2 trainer in Gilpin Air Lines paint, ca. 1944. The Gilpin Hangar and control tower, now part of an industrial park, are still in existence at West Romero Road, Tucson.http://www.airfields-freeman.com  See also  * List of defunct airlines of the United States References The papers of Gilpin Air Lines are preserved in great detail in the Greenway Collection and the Walter Douglas, Jr. Collection of the Arizona Historical Society, Tucson.

Critical plane analysis is widely used in engineering to account for the effects of cyclic, multiaxial load histories on the fatigue life of materials and structures.Fatemi, A., & Socie, D. F.

Modern metal fatigue analysis. EMAS, 2008. When a structure is under cyclic multiaxial loading, it is necessary to use multiaxial fatigue criteria that account for the multiaxial loading. If the cyclic multiaxial loading is nonproportional it is mandatory to use a proper multiaxial fatigue criteria. The multiaxial criteria based on the Critical Plane Method are the most effective criteria.Socie, D. F.;Marquis, G. B. (2000). Multiaxial Fatigue.Ed. SAE International, USA. For the plane stress case, the orientation of the plane may be specified by an angle in the plane, and the stresses and strains acting on this plane may be computed via Mohr's circle. For the general 3D case, the orientation may be specified via a unit normal vector of the plane, and the associated stresses strains may be computed via a tensor coordinate transformation law. The chief advantage of critical plane analysis over earlier approaches like Sines rule, or like correlation against maximum principal stress or strain energy density, is the ability to account for damage on specific material planes. This means that cases involving multiple out-of-phase load inputs, or crack closure can be treated with high accuracy. Additionally, critical plane analysis offers the flexibility to adapt to a wide range of materials. Critical plane models for both metals and polymers are widely used. animation showing a series of crack orientations, each of which is evaluated for fatigue life during Critical plane analysis  History  Modern procedures for critical plane analysis trace back to research published in 1973 in which M. W. Brown and K. J. Miller observed that fatigue life under multiaxial conditions is governed by the experience of the plane receiving the most damage, and that both tension and shear loads on the critical plane must be considered.

It is owned by remote company Buffer Inc. The application was designed by a group of European expats in San Francisco, most notably Joel Gascoigne and Leo Widrich. Gascoigne is currently the CEO of Buffer. By December 2019, the team had reached 90 people working remotely from 15 countries in different parts of the world, more than 4.5 million registered users and over $16 million in annual revenue. History Buffer began its development in October 2010 in Birmingham, United Kingdom by co-founder Joel Gascoigne, who established the idea of the social media application while he was in the United Kingdom. Once he developed the idea he created a landing page to see if enough people were interested in the product to make it a profitable venture. After reaching a critical mass of registrations, Gascoigne built and designed the first version of the application software over a span of 7 weeks. On November 30, 2010, the initial version of Buffer was launched. It contained limited features which only allowed access to Twitter. Four days after the software's launch Buffer gained its first paying user. A few weeks after this, the number of users reached 100, and then that number multiplied to 100,000 users within the next 9 months. In July 2011, the cofounders decided to move the startup venture from the United Kingdom to San Francisco in the United States, and Buffer was converted into an incorporation. Whilst in San Francisco, the cofounders dealt with the San Franciscan startup incubators AngelPad. This was due to the increase in cost after moving from Birmingham. Throughout December 2011, cofounders Joel and Leo were able to secure 18 investors to their company, after being refused by 88% of the people they met with to offer an investment to their company. The investors include Maneesh Arora, the founder of MightyText, Thomas Korte, the founder of AngelPad, and Andy McLoughlin, the co-founder of the software company Huddle. Due to visa issues with the co- founders, the company's base shifted to Hong Kong in January 2012. Then in August 2012, following more visa issues, it migrated again to Tel Aviv, Israel. In October 2012, Joel Gascoigne reported that \\"1.5-2% of users are on the paid plan, so we‚Äôre currently on a $800,000 annual run rate\\". In May 2013, the company's base shifted back to the United States, after the co-founders‚Äô visa predicaments were resolved. Around this time Buffer intentionally made its salary calculation algorithm public (along with the calculated salaries of its 13 employees; this number has since grown to exceed 80, almost all of whom opt-in to the salary-publishing culture). Features Free features Buffer allows users to schedule posts sent through the application to the user's social media accounts (you can connect 3 social accounts via the free version). This feature can schedule and send posts to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest. There are various default time slots in the application, which are based on the times during the day when social media users are most active online. However, Buffer does allow its users to mend or remove the default time slots if they wish to do so. The free version of the application allows a maximum limit of 10 posts to be scheduled at any given time, and only allows the management of one social media account per social media website. Buffer also contains features that give post suggestions to users, and gives information on the number of clicks, retweets, likes, favorites, mentions and potential views each post has, which is based on the number of feeds that single feed would show up on. The Buffer application is compatible with three different platforms: *Browser: allows the application to work as downloaded extensions for three browsers, Google Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox. *Mobile: allows the application to be installed on iOS systems and Android phones. *Newsreader: allows the application to be integrated with various newsreader applications, such as Flipboard and Zite. Paid features Buffer offers a paid plan, named Pro, which gives paying users access to additional features, such as the Feeds feature that adds an RSS feed to a user's Buffer profile, displaying suggested links from external websites chosen by the user. Additional features include analytics for the number of posts sent out and the number of active users over a span of time. The plan also allows an increased limit of 100 posts at any single time, and the option to manage 8 social account profiles. On August 6, 2019, Buffer announced a new feature for paid plans - the Hashtag Manager. The new feature allows paying members to create and save groups of hashtags directly within the Buffer composer.  Buffer for Business  Buffer for Business is an extension of the Buffer application intended for managing social media accounts for businesses and corporations. It launched in 2013. It contains a similar interface to Buffer, but with additional features, including: *More specified analytics that allow comparisons between different metrics, such as between retweets clicks and posts, sorting of different data to the preference of the user, and accumulation of statistics *Team collaboration features that contains approval features, admin privileges that give privileges to users assigned as managers over any other member assigned as a contributor, and allows more members of a team to access and manage the accounts *Exporting options that allow data, statistics and analysis to be exported to any reports or documents The costs of Buffer for Business differ depending on the scale and size of the potential user's business. The categories are: *Small Business: which allows the management of 25 social media accounts and the access of 5 team members *Medium Business: which allows management of 50 social media accounts and the access of 10 team members *Large Business or Agency: which allows management of 50 social media accounts and the access of 10 team members Buffer for Business produced over 10% of the company's total revenue in December 2013. In 2014, the app was used by over 2,500 publishers and agencies. Organizations that use Buffer for Business include About.com, Fortune, and Business Insider. Popularity and growth After its establishment in 2010, Buffer's total revenue per year increased to $1 million in January 2013, and then crossed $2 million in September of the same year through the growth of customers using the application. By September 2013, Buffer gained 1 million users, with around 16,000 paying users. The number of posts shared through Buffer application crossed 87,790,000 posts and the number of accounts that were used through the application reached 1,266,722, with an average of 70 posts per account. By February 2014, the number of Buffer users reached 1.3 million. The organization's annual revenue reached $3,900,000, a 38.3% increase since December 2013.  Acquisitions  In December 2015, Buffer acquired Respondly, a social media customer service and brand monitoring tool, which it has since rebranded to Reply. According to the terms of the contract, the cost of the acquisition was not released. Partnerships Buffer is partnered with various other software applications and companies. Most notably, Buffer is an official Facebook Marketing Partner under Community Management. Additionally, Buffer has partnerships with WordPress, Twitter, Zapier, IFTTT, Feedly, Pocket, Reeder, and Quuu. Security In October 2013, Buffer's system was hacked, allowing the hackers to get access to many users‚Äô accounts. This resulted in the hackers posting spam posts through many of the user's social media accounts. On October 26, 2013, Buffer was temporarily suspended as a result of the hacking. Co-founder Joel Gascoigne sent an email to all users, apologizing about the issue and advising Buffer users about what steps they should take. Buffer was then unsuspended within the same week. Related products and services Daily, launched in May 2014, was an iOS app developed by Buffer that helped users manage their social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+. In the app, a user could accept and share, or dismiss, suggested links and headline through Tinder-style swiping gestures. In March 2015, Buffer launched Pablo, a social media image creation tool. Its aim is to create engaging pictures for social media within 30 seconds.

Early life and education Johann Heinrich Baumann was born in Jelgava () into a German- speaking family. He was the son of the pastor and general superintendent of Mitau, Joachim Baumann. University Baumann went to University of Erfurt to study theology in 1773‚Äì1776. However, in Erfurt he took up painting, under the influence of (1715‚Äì1778), a notable local painter specialising in animal portraits in the then-prevailing Baroque style. After his studies, Baumann returned to his Baltic homeland Courland but would henceforth pursue a career as an artist and not as a priest. Travels Being a keen hunter, Baumann travelled as far as present-day Lithuania, Russia and Belarus on hunting expeditions. He also wrote anecdotal, whimsical short stories about his hunting adventures, for which he has been called the \\"Munchausen of Courland\\". His outdoors interests also came to dominate his art completely, which is an unusual blend of skillfulness and professionalism mixed with naivety and slovenliness. Almost all his known paintings depict animals, hunting scenes or related subjects. His style is perhaps best characterised as a provincial form of Baroque, inspired to some extent by similar motives in Dutch Golden Age painting, executed in a highly personal way. Although he never became recognised as a major artist in Imperial Russia, he was still acknowledged by a special mention of the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1786. He is reputed to have painted over 1700 paintings, however only 43 surviving paintings are safely attributed to him today. Playwriting Baumann was also one of the first authors in present-day Latvia to write plays for the stage in Latvian.

Biography Margaret, was born in Mayfair on 12 June 1788, the only child of George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith, admiral, and his first wife, Jane, only child and heiress of William Mercer of Aldie, Perth. Upon her mother's death in 1789 she became heiress to the barony of Nairne (then in attainder) and later succeeded to the title. Margaret was introduced at a young age to the circle of the Princess Charlotte of Wales, to whom she became attached and a close confidante; and this position raised a rumour against her (which, however, she was able entirely to refute) that she betrayed the princess's secrets to the Prince Regent. On 20 June 1817, at Edinburgh, Margaret married Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut, aide-de-camp to Napoleon Bonaparte, who had been educated in Britain, where he took refuge during the Bourbon Restoration. The countess held a prominent place in society since her husband held office under Louis-Philippe and later under Napoleon III, and was ambassador at Vienna, and (1860) to the Court of St. James's (London), and finally resided at Paris as Grand Chancellor of the L√©gion d'honneur. The countess, who was one of the lady patronesses of Almack's and who was a prominent member of polite society, took part in all his social and political work. She was a prolific and perspicacious letter writer, and much of her correspondence is held in the Archives nationales, Paris.See Archives du g√©n√©ral Charles de Flahaut et de sa famille : 565 AP : inventaire (online version at the Hathi Trust).

From a humble family, he is the second of six siblings born from the marriage between Vincenzo Scarafoni and Orsola. At the age of nine years, he was enrolled with his brother Ferruccio to a Salesian College in a neighboring province, across the river Adda. That's where they decided to become Salesians. In 1940 his father went to World War II and his mother died. Ugo was hospitalized for several years at the Santa Corona hospital near Genoa because of Pott's disease. Then, during a pilgrimage to Lourdes, it is said his conditions improved dramatically and he completed his studies and graduated in theology and political science to be ordained a priest on March 8, 1951. A very important part of his life was when he stayed at the Salesian house in Arese, where he worked for nearly twenty years. In 1965 he participated in the XIX chapter of the Salesian and he met Pedro Melesi who was the Salesian ambassador for Latin America. Melesi told De Censi of the difficult situation he worked in at Poxoreo, Brazil, and De Censi invited him to stay at his Arese house. In the summer of 1966, De Censi and other volunteers went to give a hand to Melesi, and in the following year they built a youth centre there. Due to the success of his mission, De Censi established the Operazione Mato Grossohttp://www.operazionematogrosso.it/ (named after the state in which Poxoreo is). For a decade De Censi followed his fellow volunteers across the Atlantic Ocean, from Italy to South America. He moved to Peru, in Chacas, so he could give more concrete help to the inhabitants. In 1979 he founded the first school for wood carving, dedicated to Don Bosco, who recruits children based on their poverty and good will. The school lasts for five years and grants room and board and education. Because of the success of these schools, De Censi also created some for girls. He also built a hospital thanks to the money raised by the Operazione Mato Grosso, and was helped by the Archdiocese of Milan to complete a home for the elderly in Pomallucay which was inaugurated by Carlo Maria Martini.

She also worked in watercolors, pastels, and as an etcher and engraver. She was particularly well known for her landscapes, which were said to have been influenced by Japanese artworks and were noted for their \\"harmony of color\\". Her obituary in the New York Times referred to her as \\"one of the best known women landscape painters.\\" Education and career In 1874, a teenage Est√© traveled to France with Emily Sartain, studying with Tony Robert-Fleury and working in the comrade d'atelier of Emily Sartain and Jeanne Rongier. Between 1876 and 1882, she studied with Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Around 1886‚Äì1887, she, her friend Cecilia Beaux and other young women artists such as Dora Brown and Julia Foote studied with William Sartain in private art classes at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women where his sister Emily Sartain was principal. In 1884, Est√© learned to etch on the press of Stephen Parrish. Parrish and fellow etcher Stephen Ferris were enrolled in the men's life class at the Pennsylvania Academy. A number of the women at the Academy became significant in the American etching revival, including Est√©, Gabrielle Clements, Blanche Dillaye, Margaret Lesley, Margaret Levin, and Mary Franklin. Florence Est√© moved permanently to France in 1888. In Paris she enrolled at the Academie Colarossi and studied with Alexandre Nozal (1852‚Äì1929) and Raphael Collin (1850‚Äì1916). She remained in France during the first world war. Her compatriot Elizabeth Nourse reported in 1915 that \\"Florence Est√© is painting again in Paris after an exciting summer, for the village where she was working had to be evacuated at the approach of the enemy.\\" She became a member of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in France around 1909 and exhibited at the Paris salons. Her painting Un Bourg breton (A Breton village) was purchased by the French government in 1918. Her painting La Vall√©e (The Valley) was purchased by the State in 1921. Some of her paintings were hung in the Luxembourg Gallery in Paris. She was also an honorary member of the Philadelphia Water Color Club, and continued to exhibit in America at the Annual Philadelphia Watercolour Exhibition, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Her watercolors won the PAFA prize in 1925. Armory Show of 1913 Black and white photograph of Florence Est√©, The First Snow, watercolor, ca. 1909 The 1913 Armory Show featured the American Association of Painters and Sculptors (AAPS), and was one of the first exhibitions of \\"new art\\" or modern art. Fifty women participated as artists and donors in this revolutionary show, making up one sixth of the contributions. These women can be considered significant leaders, forging the beginnings of the feminist art movement. Est√© exhibited two of her watercolors, The Village (variously $500 or $200) and The First Snow($300) at the 1913 Armory Show.Brown, Milton W., The Story of the Armory Show, The Joseph H. Hirshhorn Foundation, 1963, p. 242 The First Snow was previously shown in the Philadelphia Water-Color Exhibition, where it was received the following review: \\"An interesting picture, almost in monotone, by Miss Florence Est√©, entitled The First Snow, was most effective in the simplicity of the medium on a tinted background.\\" Personal life Among Est√©'s good friends included fellow students from the Pennsylvania Academy, Elizabeth MacDowell, Alice Barber Stephens, Mary K.

The song, set in the key of E major features an experimental piano bridge based on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's works. \\"Save You\\" received mixed to positive reviews by music critics, who were equivocal about its production but complimented its experimental bridge and Clarkson's performance. She has also included the song in the set list of the All I Ever Wanted Tour. Background and recording \\"Save You\\" was written by Ryan Tedder and Aim√©e Proal, with Tedder handling its production. A demo of the song was recorded by the rock band Gone 'Til November, whose lead singer is Proal, but after being dropped from Epic Records in 2008, the group disbanded even before recording took place. Development of the song continued when Tedder submitted the demo to Clive Davis, who wanted Kelly Clarkson record it.  Composition western classical music as one of his inspirations, particularly Mozart's (pictured) works. \\"Save You\\" is a midtempo rock ballad. Tedder describes its sound as \\"orchestral, classical rhythmic\\". During its bridge, the song interpolates into a piano solo which was based on various works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whom Tedder often credits as one of his musical inspirations. The instruments used for the song include: an electric Guitar, a piano, and strings, all of which were performed by Tedder. OneRepublic drummer Eddie Fisher performed the drums in the song. \\"Save You\\" is written in the key of E major, Clarkson's vocal range spans from F3 to E5. Lyrically, the song is about a person's lamentation and desire to save someone from a self-destructive behaviour, similar her 2003 song \\"Beautiful Disaster\\". In an interview with The Republican, Proal revealed that she wrote the song for her friend. she said, \\"She unfortunately lost her mother and I kind of wrote that as an apology because I wasn't around - I was in Los Angeles, I just wanted her to know that I was still thinking about her.\\"  Critical reception  Matt Busekroos of The Quinnipiac Chronicle praised the song as \\"a beautifully composed ballad with a nod to Mozart, especially near the bridge where a piano solo is prominently featured.

In fact, they're all perfectly radio-ready tunes. But with the possible exception of \\"Save You,\\" this synth-heavy stuff is just not what best suits Clarkson's skillset.

R√≠o Fr√≠o de Ju√°rez is located at the highest point on the highway between Mexico City to Puebla de Zaragoza being located at the top of the pass on the historic road between the two cities. Rio Frio de Ju√°rez, is located near the far eastern border of the State of Mexico, almost on the border of the State of Puebla, at an altitude of 3,000 meters above sea level. It is located on the main roads of the Federal Highway 150 and Mexico-Puebla Highway 190 or Mexico-Puebla Highway. The results of the Census of Population and Housing 2005 conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography state that the total population of Rio Frio is 5,272 and that there are 2,620 men and 2,655 women. History Rio Frio had its origins with the establishment and development of the Camino Real (Royal Road) linking Mexico City and Veracruz via Puebla, during the colonial era and renamed Camino Nacional (National Road) in the early years of the independent Mexico when there was no other major roadway to the capital from the east coast. Rio Frio was established at the pass at the top of the mountain range between the Valley of Mexico and Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley surrounded by lush pine forests. It provided food and lodging for the huge number of travelers and riches that were transported along this road, since it was often necessary stay to over night in this place. During the early years of independent Mexico, this area known as El Monte Rio Frio, became the haunt of bands of raiders who robbed travelers passing through the area. The Mexican government had no ability to protect the roads from these bandits which became common in the area of Rio Frio. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, R√≠o Fr√≠o was the post of E,F,G,H,I,J and L companies of the Second Ohio Volunteer Infantry.Mexican Service of the Second Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Official roster of the soldiers of the state of Ohio in the War of the Rebellion, 1861‚Äì1866, Werner Co., Akron, 1895 It was one of the American garrisons protecting their line of communications from Mexico City via Puebla to Vera Cruz from the guerrilla forces of Mexico. The story of the banditry of R√≠o Fr√≠o was made famous by the novel, Los bandidos de R√≠o Fr√≠o, by the writer Manuel Payno; this situation ended with the arrival of the government of Porfirio Diaz, who with the use of the Guardia Rural restored security on the roads. This novel was made into a telenovela in 1976. Popular for hikers and climbers, the town is the main point of access to the Zoquiapan National Forest, which has large areas covered in high mountain forests and volcanos, such as Iztacc√≠huatl, Telap√≥n, mount Tlaloc and Cerro Gordo. From the north west part of town there are antique trails that lead to the summit of mount Tlaloc, an extinct volcano on which stands an archeological ceremonial site which at 4,120 m is the highest standing archeological site in the Americas. It was historically recorded as a place of pilgrimship during precolonial times, intended to the adoration of the Mesoamerican rain deity Tlaloc. Today there are still followers of these traditions, most notably people who believe the site to be the Tlalocan, a mythological utopia referred in various ancient Toltec and aztec codexes. In this Mythology the site regarded as the dwelling place of Tlaloc. The town is also famous for its alpine architecture and for having one of the lowest average temperature rates in central Mexico; the surroundings of the town are also famous for having a large number of weekend alpine style farms and cabins, and for the High Mountain food style stands along the main roads between Mexico City and Puebla.

The subspecies E. b. subsp. beaugleholei is restricted to a single site in Alpine National Park in eastern Victoria, south-east Australia. It grows on wet, mossy rocks close to a waterfall at an altitude of about 1320 metres. A survey in 2001 found only three patches of the plant, covering a total area of 1 m2. The subspecies is considered to be at high risk of extinction due to threats such as rock fall, drought, illegal collection and damage by visitors. E. b. subsp. brunnescens has been introduced to Great Britain and Ireland where it was first recorded in 1904 in Craigmillar, Edinburgh. It spread rapidly from the 1930s onwards and is now widespread in northern and western areas where rainfall and humidity are higher. It has not yet spread to many parts of southern and central England and central Ireland. It occurs in various damp, open, gravelly or stony habitats including hillsides, stream banks, waste tips, stone walls, paths and railway sidings. The species has also been introduced to Norway where it was first recorded in 1931 but is still rare.

It is sited on the rock known as Le Biseau, or Le Bis√©, part of the reef Les Hanois one mile north west of Pleinmont where the Trinity House cottages were built. It was erected in response to an increasing number of shipwrecks on the treacherous rocks off the western coast of Guernsey. Planning Shipwrecks shortly before the construction included the wreck of ' () in 1807 A further wreck in 1816 of the Marie Elizabeth, a merchant ship from Copenhagen, at Rocquaine triggered letters and discussions about undertaking a nobel project, Trinity House was contacted and in January 1817 about a possible lighthouse on the Pleinmont cliff top, they wrote back saying a lighthouse was not necessary as the lights on Les Casquets and at Portland were sufficient and a new lighthouse would be confusing and do more harm than good. The Trinity House Brethren appear to have misunderstood the request as these locations are 45 km and 125 km away and neither can be seen from south of Guernsey. Additional ships were wrecked in 1820, 1834 and 1835, with pressure being exerted on Trinity House, who in 1847 reconsidered the proposal and sent a representative to visit the island. Local shipowners were against a tax to pay for a lighthouse as they knew of the dangers and did not need it. A further wreck in 1848 of the Emmanuel carrying timber from Canada to Hull had mistaken the Casquets light for the Portland light and erroneously sailed further south to disaster. The Rector of Torteval proposed putting a light on the top of the 105m church steeple which was considered by Trinity House in 1849 as a possible cheap alternative, but after an inspection, the steeple was found to be unsuitable. Arguments for and against abounded, the Guernsey Chamber of Commerce were against, the Jersey Chamber was for, Trinity House was informed that they did not have jurisdiction to build a lighthouse in Guernsey and that Guernsey had no funds to pay for it. An article appeared in The Times on 15 July 1850 asking about the necessity of a Lighthouse at Pleinmont Point Trinity House agreed that a lighthouse was necessary and the Bailiff of Guernsey now stepped forward, confirming that the island was not opposed and the precedent of the Casquets lighthouse gave Trinity House the necessary authority but would not consent to a levy or taxation by an English Board. In 1851 the British government agreed to pay for the lighthouse provided Guernsey and Jersey would defray the maintenance costs, subject to a maximum of ¬£900 per annum. Guernsey objected to the cost, proposing to pay just ¬£75p.a.. The House of Commons got involved, reviewing the costs in 1852 and proposed to add a clause to the 1854 Merchant Shipping Bill. Guernsey objected to the proposed removal of their 1204 rights of self taxation and the Privy Council relented and asked what the Channel Islands would contribute, ¬£100 p.a. total was the answer. The impasse was resolved by England stating that they would levy dues on Channel Island ships docking in England, so collecting over ¬£900 per annum. This forced the issue but the cost was reduced when it was decided that Channel Island shipping would in future be treated as coastal shipping, rather than pay the dues at the overseas rate. Construction In July 1858 Trinity House inspected the rocks to determine which was practical. A local pilot advised using Le Bisseau rocks as it could be landed on in most sea conditions whereas La Mauve rocks were in a better location. The cost of construction, measured by the number of days it was possible to access the rocks, decided the issue with Le Bisseau chosen. The design required the light to be above high water. A width of at the base, at the waist and at the light. This dictated 24,542 cu ft of masonry would be needed, weighing 2,500 tonnes. A circular staircase would serve six rooms, one on each level. The tapered granite tower, painted white, is notable in terms of lighthouse engineering because it was the first to be built with all the stones dovetailed together both laterally and vertically, thereby making the construction a single solid mass. The cement mortar in the joints formed between stone faces lock the dovetails so that the stones cannot be separated without being broken. This method, used for the first time at the Hanois Lighthouse, became the pattern adopted for subsequent lighthouses built on sea rocks. The cement was a quick drying type invented by John Smeaton. The resident engineer was William Douglass, the 28-year-old son of Nicholas Douglass, an engineer, who had suggested using the Dovetail joint for the stones. The lighthouse was constructed in Cornish granite rather than stone from Guernsey. Cornish masons were employed to dress the stone on the castle pier in Saint Peter Port Harbour, with the finished numbered stones taken by barge to the site. Construction workers on the lighthouse worked in gangs of 16 and when resting were accommodated in Fort Grey. The men being employed to build the lighthouse keepers cottage at Portelet when the weather was bad. The foundation stone was laid on 14 August 1860 by the Bailiff of Guernsey with several Jurats also present as well as a crowd on a flotilla of local boats. By March 1862 the tower was 60 ft high. In August they were ready for the light which arrived in October however completion was slightly delayed by bad weather, with the light lit for the first time in late November. Final commissioning was in late 1863, the cost being ¬£25,296. Light and bell Chance Brothers built the light using 672 pieces of glass. The lens was designed by James Chance and inspected by Michael Faraday who gave it his unqualified approbation. It was a sixteen-sided revolving catadioptric optic of the first-order, which displayed a red flash every forty-five seconds and was visible at . The red colour was achieved through fitting a ruby glass chimney over the multi-wick oil lamp at the centre of the lens. A 7 cwt fog bell was provided, sounding every minute, however it was not very effective. Tower Les Hanois Lighthouse in 2015 The lower room contained fuel oil, water and provisions, with a toilet. Once the coal stove was replaced a shower room was added. The next was the oil room, later the winch room. Room 3 contained the food and explosives, necessary as a fog signal before the electric fog signal was installed, it later became a generator room for the diesel generators. Room 4 was the kitchen and living room with small windows. Level 5 was the bedroom with \\"banana\\" bunks. Room 6 was the watch room which housed the engine control panels and later radios. The next stairs led to the original lantern room, later to become a diesel engine room, compressor room for the fog horn and battery room, above which is the lens. Purpose Its role is to provide a mark warning of the reefs and rocks to the west of Guernsey and providing a position fix for vessels entering the Channel Traffic Separation Scheme. The reef Les Hanois includes, besides Le Bis√© and numerous small rocks, the following major rocks: Le Grand Hanois, Le Petit Hanois, La Perc√©e, Round Rock and La Grosse Rocque. View of the lighthouse and Les Hanois reef 20th century In 1905 the colour of the light was altered from red to white; it continued to flash once every 45 seconds, but now shone more powerfully.London Gazette, Issue 27785, Page 2897, 18 April 1905. The fog bell was still in use, sounding once every 15 seconds when required. From 1915 an explosive fog signal was sounded in addition to the bell: it consisted of a gun-cotton charge electrically fired. If needed it would be let off every 2 1/2 minutes, each charge had to be hung outside the tower from a jib, which was wound up to avoid the blast breaking the glass. During World War II the light was kept operational until the keepers and their families were evacuated on 21 June 1940. German forces occupied the lighthouse in July 1940 but it was not lit again until September 1945, after the liberation, because the optic had been slightly damaged by gunfire. The Trinity House cottages at Portelet were occupied by troops during the war. In 1964 the light was electrified, a filament lamp replacing the paraffin vapour burner previously in use. After more than a hundred years of service, the old optic was removed from the tower and presented by Trinity House to the new Pilkington Glass Museum (Pilkington Brothers having gained a controlling interest in the firm of Chance Brothers, the original manufacturers). In its place a smaller (fourth-order) rotating optic was installed, which displayed two white flashes every five seconds. A fog horn, sounded by compressed air, was also installed as part of the upgrade. The helicopter pad on top of the lighthouse was built in 1979. The lighthouse was demanned in January 1996 following automation. At the same time it was converted to work from solar power. This required a slowing down of the optic, changing the character of the light, so as to reduce the power requirement while maintaining the range required. As part of the automation process, the compressed-air fog signal was replaced by an electric emitter. Present day The current light signals two white flashes every 13 seconds and has a range of . The funding of the lighthouse has now reversed, with Guernsey bearing the maintenance cost and Trinity House paying a nominal ¬£1,000 per annum.

Romanoff, as well as the rest of the band, is featured prominently in the 2012 documentary Punk Jews. He is also a drummer for Shabasa labelmates Blanket Statementstein, RockaZion, and Shin Shin Mem. Biography Early life Romanoff was born in 1986 on Long Island. His father was a secular Jew, while his mother was an atheist who converted to Orthodox Judaism. He attended a Modern Orthodox yeshiva at a young age. Frustrated with the yeshiva's rules and strictures, he left and began going to public high school. During his teenage years, Romanoff became a fan of punk rock, following bands like Left√∂ver Crack and F-Minus and going to shows at CBGB and ABC No Rio. He also dabbled in drugs, smoking marijuana daily and developing a heroin addiction. Later on, Romanoff took trips to Israel with Birthright Israel and Young Judaea, which left him curious about his heritage. With the help of his friend Mike Wagner, he ultimately kicked his drug addiction, becoming straight edge, and renewed his commitment to Judaism. He is a vegan. Career In 2008, Romanoff, wanting to reconcile his love of punk with his newfound faith, began writing and recording Jewish- themed punk songs under the name Moshiach Oi!. Initially a solo project, Moshiach Oi! became a full band with the addition of Wagner on guitar, Mitchell \\"Mordechai\\" Harrison on bass, and Paul \\"Pesach\\" Alpert on drums. The group's debut album, Better Get Ready, produced by Wagner and mastered by Don Fury, was released by Shemspeed and Shabasa in 2009. A second album, This World is Nothing, was released independently in 2011. The band was featured heavily in the 2012 documentary Punk Jews. Romanoff in particular appears in the film's opening scene, where he is shown screaming on a rooftop. He also appears on the cover of former Forward columnist Michael Croland's 2016 book Oy Oy Oy Gevalt!: Jews and Punk. Performance style In typical punk fashion, Romanoff's live performances are often wild and exuberant. John Leland of The New York Times described him at a 2013 concert, \\"side curls flailing, knees jackknifing up around his torso, leaping, crouching, shouting...\\" Matthue Roth, in a Tablet Magazine piece covering Blanket Statementstein, referred to Romanoff as \\"the drummer for whom Animal the Muppet is probably not only a musical guide but a fashion icon.\\" Discography ;With Moshiach Oi! *Better Get Ready (2009; Shemspeed, Shabasa) *This World is Nothing (2011; Shabasa) ;Other work *Blanket Statementstein, Blanket Statementstein (2008) *RockaZion, In This Generation (2011) *Shin Shin Mem, Shirei Moharan Vol. 1 (2014) References Category:Hasidic singers Category:American punk rock singers Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Moshiach Oi! members Category:Jews in punk rock Category:Jewish American musicians Category:21st-century American singers Category:Musicians from New York (state) Category:People from Long Island Category:Baalei teshuva Category:Breslov Hasidim Category:American punk rock drummers ","title":"Yishai Romanoff"},{"id":"39112646","text":"Arron Spencer Davis (born 11 February 1972) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League as a full-back for Torquay United and Colchester United.

Its first location opened in 1976. McDonald's New Zealand currently has over 160 restaurants operating nationwide, serving an estimated one million people each week. McDonald's Restaurants NZ earned revenues of over $250 million in the 2018 financial year. As with McDonald's locations worldwide, the franchise primarily sells hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes, the company has expanded its menu to include salads, fish, wraps, smoothies, and fruit. The company also operates the Georgie Pie and McCaf√© chains within many of its stores; through the latter McDonald's is the largest coffee shop brand in the country. McDonald's New Zealand operations are based in Greenlane, Auckland.  History  1970s New Zealand's first McDonald's restaurant, Porirua, 1976 The first McDonald's restaurant in New Zealand opened on Cobham Court in central Porirua on Monday 7 June 1976, however it was not officially opened until the following Saturday. The original menu featured the Big Mac (75 cents), Quarter Pounder (65c), Quarter Pounder with Cheese (75c), Filet-O-Fish (65c), cheeseburger (40c) and hamburger (30c). Problems were encountered opening the restaurant due to strict import laws at the time, which limited importing of overseas products that could be produced in New Zealand. The kitchen for the Porirua restaurant was imported on the condition that it was to allow local companies to reproduce it, and it was to be sent back after 12 months. However, the kitchen had been cemented into the floor and removing parts of it while still maintaining the restaurant operation meant it was impossible. The New Zealand affiliate eventually negotiated with the Corporation to import more kitchens in exchange for a large surplus of cheese the New Zealand Dairy Board (now Fonterra) had. Once the Porirua restaurant was open, there were additional problems with the supply chain, with frequent industrial unrest often shutting down suppliers without warning for weeks on end. An industrial dispute shut down the bun supplier in mid-1976, resulting in McDonald's staff having to drive all over Wellington to find substitute buns, and then cutting the sesame seed buns for the Big Mac using two bandsaws placed side-by-side. Beef patties were initially supplied from the Gear Meat Company in Petone, although supply was haphazard until a purpose-built meat forming machine was acquired in 1977. Like many other companies at the time, Gear Meat was plagued by industrial unrest and closed down without warning in 1982, leaving McDonald's to import beef patties from Australia. The affiliate acquired Gear Meat's patty-forming machine and moved it to Auckland to secure production. By coincidence, part of Gear Meat's former site now contains a McDonald's restaurant. The second New Zealand restaurant opened in the old Auckland Savings Bank Building on Queen Street, Auckland in July 1977. Restaurants in New Lynn and Lower Hutt opened in 1978, being the first with drive-throughs. By the end of the decade, restaurants had also opened in Takapuna, Henderson, and Courtenay Place (central Wellington). 1980s Expansion in the first ten years was initially limited to the North Island. The first South Island restaurants opened on 3 November 1987 at Merivale and Linwood in Christchurch. Problems finding franchisees meant the opening of the third restaurant at Riccarton was delayed until later, while the franchisees of the Whangarei restaurant transferred south to the Merivale restaurant on the possibility of a second restaurant in the future. Both restaurants almost broke worldwide opening day records, just losing the title due to a poor exchange rate. 1990s DC-3 plane attached to the McDonald's restaurant in Taupo (pictured in 2012) In 1990, McDonald's purchased a former car yard site for its Taupo restaurant, which opened in November that year. The site came with a decommissioned Douglas DC-3 aircraft, complete with intact cockpit. The plane has become a tourist landmark, and now contains a seating area for diners. The 50th New Zealand McDonald's restaurant opened in 1991 at Chartwell Square Mall, Hamilton. The 100th restaurant opened five years later at the Auckland University of Technology. Breakfast meals were introduced in the same year, first at the Auckland Queen Street restaurant before expanding nationally. McDonald's purchased the fast-food chain Georgie Pie from Progressive Enterprises in 1996. The Georgie Pie chain closed in 1998, with half of the 32 restaurants converting to McDonald's and the remainder sold off. In 1998, New Zealand's first McCaf√© opened in the Queen Street restaurant. From 1997 to 1999 the company endorsed McDonald's Young Entertainers, a televised talent show for young New Zealanders. 2000s In 2004, the Happy Meal children's menu celebrated 25 years since its introduction in 1979. In the same year, nutrition labelling was introduced to packaging on McDonald's core menu items. In 2009, the original Porirua McDonald's restaurant in Cobham Court closed, replaced by a new restaurant with drive-through a short distance away in Kenepuru Drive. 2010s In May 2013, McDonald's announced it would bring Georgie Pie back on a trial basis, selling a single pie flavour through several McDonald's restaurants in the Upper North Island. Later in October, it announced it would roll out Georgie Pie to all McDonald's restaurants nationwide, excluding those who could not accommodate the necessary equipment. =Create your taste= In 2014 McDonald's introduced 'Create Your Taste' to New Zealand. The customer creates a gourmet burger from scratch on the touch- screen \\"kiosk\\" and the burger, fries and drink are delivered to them at their table. A related competition invited customers to submit their burger creations to the McDonald's website and relied on users to vote for their favourite design. The competition was pulled in July 2016 after website users created burgers with offensive names. =All Day Breakfast= Following the United States and Australia, McDonald's launched the All Day Breakfast menu in New Zealand on May 4, 2016. The menu consists of a limited range of breakfast products, which are: * Hotcakes * Hashbrown * NYC and BLT Bagels * Bacon and Egg McMuffin * Chicken McMuffin * Chicken and Bacon McMuffin =40th Anniversary= McDonald's celebrated 40 years in New Zealand on 7 June 2016; the Queen Street Auckland restaurant marked the anniversary with 1970s retro service and items on the original menu sold at their 1976 prices. At that date, McDonald's had 166 restaurants operating in New Zealand; a 167th restaurant at Silverstream, Upper Hutt was closed awaiting rebuilding after it caught fire in February 2016. =Te Reo MƒÅori= In 2018, the Hastings restaurant became the first in the country to offer a menu written in te reo MƒÅori. = Happy Meal Reader's Program (2019) = In February 2019, McDonald's extended its global Happy Meal Reader's Program to New Zealand where they replaced the Happy Meal toys with books to encourage reading among children. They announced to give away 800,000 copies of Roald Dahl books over the course of 12 months, where they will introduce a new book each month. Delivery McDonald's announced McDelivery, a delivery service, would start being trialed in Auckland starting 20 July 2016 in New Lynn and Glenfield. All deliveries will require a $25 order and incur a $7.50 delivery fee.  Products  The McDonald's Kiwiburger McDonald's New Zealand sells products consistent with its international markets ‚Äì including the chain's signature product, the Big Mac. Items unique to the New Zealand menu include: *Kiwiburger ‚Äì A take on the classic New Zealand hamburger: quarter-pound beef patty, egg, lettuce, tomato, beetroot, onion, ketchup and mustard. Introduced in 1991 as a permanent menu item but withdrawn in 2004 due to complications with the egg and beetroot. It has returned as a limited-time item in 2007, 2009 and every year from 2011 to 2015. * Massive McMuffin ‚Äì bacon, egg, cheese, two sausage patties and ketchup between two English muffins. This product is not available on the All Day Breakfast menu. * Georgie Pie ‚Äì A flaking pie pastry containing either Steak Mince And Cheese or Bacon and Egg. * The Boss ‚Äì A double-patty burger with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and Swiss cheese. * Breakfast Bagels ‚Äì bagels on the breakfast menu that come in two flavours: NYC Benedict or BLT. These products are available on the All Day Breakfast menu. * Chicken McMuffin ‚Äì a McChicken patty on two English Muffins with a slice of cheese and mayonnaise. , McDonald's bought more than NZ$150 million worth of local produce for its New Zealand restaurants. Since 2018, the McDonald's Cookie Time McFlurry has been available through Uber Eats.  Franchisees and employment relations  McDonald's New Zealand has union representation. This has led to demands for equal pay with other fast food sector employees, such as those in KFC. There were also protests about favouritism of police officers and the accused harassment of one member staff for being gay. The demand for higher wages ultimately led to a strike which began on 22 May 2013 in the Bunny St McDonald's in Wellington. In May 2013, the National Government reintroduced a youth minimum wage for 16- and 17-year- olds at 80 percent of the adult minimum wage. McDonald's was one of seven major companies employing young people to reject a youth minimum wage and insisting young employees be paid at least the adult minimum wage. In December 2019, Lauren McAuslin was the youngest McDonald's franchisee in the country. She is 34 and owns a restaurant in New Plymouth. She also ran her parent's business in Blenheim where she sold Big Macs and milkshakes.

On 20 September 1791 he was elected chief of the Orne district battalion by its members, and was confirmed as Chef de brigade by the Repr√©sentants en mission Trullard and Berlier on 27 September 1793. The next day he was made General de brigade and commandant of Bergues. On 26 January 1794 he was appointed commander of the fortress of Landrecies. Here his rank was made permanent on 12 April 1794.

Biography Adams was born in Caerleon, South Wales and was educated at the Welsh School of Architecture in Cardiff and the Architectural Association in London. He spent 15 years working in the practice of Will Alsop in London, before returning to Wales in 1998. He later claimed he returned to Wales because London was \\"very inward-looking and self-regarding\\", while Wales was facing the \\"exciting time\\" of devolution during the late '90s. Adams joined Percy Thomas Architects and began work on the ¬£106 million Wales Millennium Centre project in Cardiff Bay, which opened in November 2004 and for which he is best known. Adams says the design was inspired by the architect of Cardiff Castle, William Burges and the layered cliffs of the South Wales coast. The building was designed to create a modern Welsh identity, using North Wales slate and Welsh timber cladding. In June 2004 Percy Thomas Architects were taken over by outsourcing company Capita. Adams agreed to remain with the company, though many of his colleagues left. Adams was President of the Royal Society of Architects in Wales (RSAW) from 2005 to 2007. During his tenure, he expressed concern that the public often didn't understand good architecture. In 2005 he began work on a major refurbishment and reorganisation of Cardiff's Sherman Theatre. The building re-opened in February 2012. Its facade used a distinctive metal cladding and the new entrance was relocated under a dramatic \\"eyelid\\". In February 2010 Adams' new headquarters building for the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) was opened. It received criticism from the Wales branch of the Victorian Society, which likened it to an \\"upturned sandcastle\\". Adams had designed it to be contemporary, clad in steel and eye-catching from the main road. Adams presented a BBC television documentary about the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, which was broadcast at the end of August 2017 on BBC4 and BBC2 Wales.

It is based on the exile of Argentine president Juan Per√≥n, who was deposed in 1955 by a military coup named Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, left the country, and finally returned in 1973. The actor playing Per√≥n is V√≠ctor Laplace. Title The film is named after Puerta de Hierro, the Madrid residential neighbourhood where Per√≥n had his villa. Plot Close to his final return to Argentina, Per√≥n begins to record in tapes his memoirs of the exile. He begins with the bombing of Plaza de Mayo and the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora military coup against him, which caused his departure from the country. He met the Argentine dancer Mar√≠a Estela Mart√≠nez in Panam√°, who stayed with him. He finally settled in Spain, and became a friend of his doctor and a tailor named Sof√≠a who did not recognize him. Despite of his distance of the country, he stayed informed of all the ongoing political developments, and several Argentine political figures visited him. Jos√© L√≥pez Rega began to work at the house, and became an influential figure over Isabel. Per√≥n made an attempt to return to Argentina by laying clues that he would do so through Paraguay and fly instead to Brazil; but the Brazilian military forced him to return to Spain. Per√≥n revealed his identity to Sof√≠a before making the flight, which redefined their relation since then. The political crisis in Argentina worsened, and de facto president Alejandro Agust√≠n Lanusse finally agreed to lift the proscription of Peronism and allow the return of Per√≥n. Per√≥n recorded his memoirs of the exile for Sof√≠a, and his last tape ended with the tango song \\"Volver\\" (). Creation Puerta de Hierro is the fifth film directed by actor V√≠ctor Laplace. Laplace had previously played Per√≥n at the movie Eva Per√≥n: The True Story, the theater play \\"Borges y Per√≥n\\" and the telenovela Padre Coraje. The movie is based in the works of writers such as Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez, Jos√© Pablo Feinmann and Norberto Galasso, but the private life of Juan Per√≥n is largely undocumented, so most scenes were made up by the script writers. As the movie is based in the late life of Per√≥n, the script puts emphasis in his fears of death. Laplace sought to mimic Per√≥n in gestures, talking style and voice inflection, and repeated several of his quotations. The newspaper La Voz del Interior praised as well the work of the actors Victoria Carreras and Fito Yanelli as Isabel Per√≥n and L√≥pez Rega, and the striking similarity of Manuel Vicente with H√©ctor C√°mpora. The film was premiered in C√≥rdoba on April 11, at the \\"Paseo del Buen Pastor\\". The ceremony was attended by governor Jos√© Manuel de la Sota, who praised the film and the approach that focused on Per√≥n's private life. He pointed that the movie reflects both the good and bad things about a highly influential figure of Argentine politics. The premiere in Buenos Aires was done at the theater \\"El Argentino\\", and the money was given for charity for the victims of recent floods.

Originating from an area of low pressure over the western Pacific, Nora was first identified as a tropical depression on October 2, 1973. Tracking generally westward, the system gradually intensified, attaining typhoon status the following evening. After turning northwestward, the typhoon underwent a period of rapid intensification, during which its central pressure decreased by 77 mb (hPa; 2.27 inHg) in 24 hours. At the end of this phase, Nora peaked with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a pressure of 877 mb (hPa; 25.91 inHg), making it the most-intense tropical cyclone on record (alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958) at the time; however, this pressure has since been surpassed by three other typhoons and one hurricane. The typhoon subsequently weakened and turned northwestward as it approached the Philippines. After brushing Luzon on October 7, the system passed south of Taiwan and ultimately made landfall in China on October 10\\\\. Once onshore, Nora quickly weakened and dissipated the following day. The Philippines and Taiwan sustained the most extensive losses from Typhoon Nora, with 36 people losing their lives collectively. In the former, more than 1 million residents were left homeless as high winds and flooding wrecked homes. Damage in the country reached $2 million (1973 USD). In Taiwan, more than 1,000 homes were destroyed and 8,000 people were left homeless. The typhoon was also responsible for several maritime incidents that killed at least four people. Meteorological history On September 30, a weak surface low developed within the monsoon trough about 195 km (120 mi) south of Yap. Drifting northwestward, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression by October 2\\\\. Later that day, aircraft reconnaissance revealed the system to have intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Nora. The system's movement soon became slow and erratic, with Nora executing a counter-clockwise loop on October 3. After completing the loop, it attained typhoon status and acquired a temporary northward trajectory. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Luming. Late on October 4, Nora began to undergo a period of rapid intensification. Several aircraft reconnaissance missions were flown by the U.S. Air Force 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron into the storm between October 5 and 6, documenting the typhoon's dramatic strengthening. By the evening of October 5, Nora had attained winds in excess of 260 km/h (160 mph), ranking it as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. A recon mission into the storm at this time revealed concentric eyewalls, measured at and . Initially, the aircraft was unable to penetrate into the core of the eye due to severe turbulence; however, they were successful after a second attempt. Once inside the eye, they discovered an almost cloud-free center with \\"an amphitheater or bowl-like appearance.\\" Stratocumulus clouds were suppressed to an unusually low altitude of . The core of Nora was exceptionally warm, with temperatures reaching a near-record at the 700 mb level. At 0020 UTC on October 6, a dropsonde released by the reconnaissance team recorded a surface pressure of 877 mb (hPa; 25.91 inHg) just inside the eyewall of the typhoon. At this time, maximum winds were estimated to have peaked at 295 km/h (185 mph). This intensity ranked Nora as the most-intense tropical cyclone on record in the world, alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958. However, in post-storm analysis, it was noted that since the dropsonde did not record a pressure at the storm's center, Nora was likely slightly stronger than indicated. Since then, Nora's intensity has been surpassed by three other storms: Typhoon June in 1975, Typhoon Tip in 1979, and Hurricane Patricia in 2015. Despite the storm's extreme intensity, it quickly began to weaken as it approached the Philippines on October 6\\\\. Within ten hours, the pressure rose to 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg) and later dropped below Category 5 status. That morning, Nora turned more northwesterly in response to a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over China. Steady weakening continued over the following days, with the storm brushing the northeastern tip of Luzon, Philippines, with winds of 175-185 km/h (110-115 mph) on October 7. Nora's intensity leveled out around 130 km/h (80 mph) on October 8 as it tracked between the Philippines and Taiwan. After passing within 95 km (60 mi) of Taiwan, Nora turned more northerly before making landfall near Xiamen, Fujian as a minimal typhoon early on October 10\\\\. Once onshore, the storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating the following day. Preparations and impact Prior to the typhoon's arrival in the Philippines, all domestic flights in and out of Manila were cancelled; however, international travel was unaffected. The United States Air Force also moved its planes from Clark Air Base to other bases in Asia. Additionally, all schools in Manila were closed. Brushing the coast of Luzon in the Philippines as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon, Nora caused considerable damage in the region. Gale-force winds were measured across much of western Luzon, with a peak reading of at Manila port. These winds caused scattered power and communication losses throughout the Peninsula. The city of Baguio (population 100,000) lost power for approximately six hours. Crop losses were extensive, with the storm striking close to harvest time. Heavy rains from the storm, peaking at in Baguio, triggered significant flooding and caused a breach in the Arnedo Dike in Apalit, Pampanga. Eight towns along a 45 km (30 mi) stretch downstream were flooded; however, roads remained passable. Flooding in Manila also prompted the evacuation of 400 residents. In Caloocan, a child died after being electrocuted by downed wires. Across the Philippines, 24 people were killed and over 1 million were left homeless. Damage to crops and property reached $2 million (1973 USD). Nora was the first of three typhoons to impact the Philippines in the span of a week, with Patsy and Ruth striking the country on October 12 and 15 respectively. While passing south of Taiwan, rough seas spawned by the typhoon were responsible for several maritime incidents over the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. The Philippine Freighter Asian Mariner, though all 38 crewmen were rescued. The Greek freighter Baltic Klif capsized about 150 km (90 mi) southwest of the Penghu Islands, with three crewmen confirmed dead and several others missing and presumed dead. Additionally, the Taiwanese fishing vessel Jai Tai NR3 became stranded amid seas, with its bow split open. One of the crew perished; however, the frigate USS Worden was able to rescue seven fishermen despite the dangerous seas. As the storm neared landfall in China, two ships became stranded over the South China Sea and sent out distress signals. Passing within 95 km (60 mi) of Taiwan, the storm brought gale-force winds and torrential rain to the island. A peak gust of was measured in Tungchi, Penghu Islands. The most significant impacts came from the rains, which amounted to in Sinkong over a 20‚Äëhour span. Widespread flooding and many landslides destroyed at least 1,000 homes, and washed out bridges, roads, and railroads. Twelve people lost their lives and twenty-eight others were reported missing. Additionally, 8,000 people were left homeless. In Hong Kong, the typhoon produced gusty winds, peaking at 95 km/h (60 mph), though no rainfall was recorded. Although Nora struck China as a typhoon, there were no reports of damage received.

Its mission is \\"to collect, document, preserve, interpret and disseminate knowledge of Maine history relating to farms and farming communities between 1865 and 1940, providing an educational and cultural experience for the public and a resource for researchers of this period.\\" The University of Maine was founded in 1865 as the \\"Maine College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts\\". The centerpiece of the museum is the Maine Experiment Station Barn, a 19th-century barn, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, that is the last standing agricultural building on the campus. Setting The museum is located on the eastern side of the Orono campus south of Sebago Street and east of Grove Street. It includes a cluster of four buildings across the parking lot east of Hitcher Hall. The main building is a three-story post-and-beam barn, set on a graded lot with ground level access to the lower to levels. South of the barn stand three smaller buildings: a one-room school house originally from Holden that was built in 1855, and the Winston E. Pullen Carriage House and Blacksmith Shop, built in 2003. The museum houses displays and artifacts on the rural history of Maine in the 19th and 20th centuries. Longtime Maine food educator and recipe columnist Mildred Brown Schrumpf contributed many artifacts to furnish the \\"Brownie's Kitchen\\" exhibit depicting an early 20th-century farmhouse kitchen. History The University of Maine was established in 1865, with a focus on agricultural education and practices. In 1885 the state established the Maine Fertilizer Control and Agricultural Experiment Station, which was colocated with the university's agricultural facilities, and was made a department of the university in 1887. The university states that the barn's construction dates to 1833, while the National Register nomination, prepared by the state's Historic Preservation Commission in 1990, dates the barn to 1885. The barn was originally located at the site of Merrill Hall, and was moved in 1930 to a point several hundred feet south of that site. It was moved to the present location in the 1990s, in anticipation for its new role as a museum.

It was on public display in England for many years before its sale in 2012. Background Picasso was 20 years old in 1901, and struggling to make his mark at the start of his artistic career. He returned for a second spell in Paris, to prepare for a joint exhibition in the summer with Francisco Iturrino at Ambroise Vollard's gallery. Towards the end of the year, Picasso moved away from the rapid impressionistic brushwork that had won him praise towards a flatter, abstracted presentation, with blocks of colour outlined in black, typical of his blue period. Painting The painting depicts a small child, probably a girl, with short ginger hair wearing a white gown tied at the waist with a blue sash. The subject stands holding a white dove in two hands, beside a ball with brightly coloured segments like a colour wheel. The background is painted flatly, an abstracted blue sky and green grass. It measures by . The work can be read as a picture of the innocence of childhood; as an essay in abstraction, with shapes simplified and superfluous details left out; or as a commentary on colour theory, with large blocks of colour - orange hair set against blue sky, and white dress set against green grass. It is thickly painted, perhaps concealing an earlier work underneath. The potential sentimentality of the subject matter is avoided by the use of bright colours. History The painting was acquired by French art dealer Paul Rosenberg. It was bought in 1924 by a Mrs RA Workman from the Alexander Reid Gallery in Glasgow, but she sold it to Samuel Courtauld in 1928. On his death in 1947, he bequeathed it to Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway, wife of Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway. After the death of Lady Aberconway, the family loaned the painting to the National Gallery from 1974 to 2010, and it was also displayed at exhibitions at the Courtauld Gallery and the Tate Gallery. It was described by Arts Council England as \\"probably the most famous work by Picasso in a UK collection\\". In 2012, the painting was sold in a private sale brokered by auction house Christie's on behalf of the Aberconway family. The price was reported as ¬£50 million. The government imposed a temporary export ban which expired in December 2012 because no British institution was able to match the purchase price to acquire the work. It was displayed at an exhibition of Picasso's works from 1901 at the Courtauld Gallery until May 2013, and was expected to be exported when the Courtauld exhibition closed in May 2013. In April 2013 it was reported by Le Figaro that the buyer was the Qatar Museums Authority.

The film revolves around a young American man named Simon who is visiting Paris and his relationship with a Middle Eastern prostitute and a French woman he meets on the metro. It is a character study centering on Simon's sociopathic tendencies and their effects on the people that come into his life. Plot After his girlfriend of five years, Michelle leaves him when he aggressively accuses her of cheating on him, college graduate Simon takes a trip to Paris. He writes multiple emails to her expressing his desire for communication, but he insults her privately as he writes. He also lies to her about having met someone. After unsuccessfully trying to meet a girl the night before, Simon visits a bar/brothel where he meets prostitute Victoria. After some brief introductions, he pays to have sex with her, but only has her strip naked and grinds against her leg until he orgasms. She offers Simon her number so they can meet again. They meet later and have sex. He later receives an email back from Michelle, where she expresses care for him but also tells him he now frightens her. On the day when he is supposed to leave the apartment he is staying at, scours a nearby train station for a person or people to beat and rob him. When he finds a group of thugs to do that, he lets them attack him and uses these excuses to stay at Victoria's place. While in bed together, she tells him in English about her abusive ex-husband, then in French about how she miscarried and her husband raped her before taking her to the hospital. Simon, his French poor, misunderstands as \\"You have a son.\\" The next day, Simon theorizes that most of Victoria's clients must be married, and suggests blackmailing them for money. They begin a romantic relationship. After an unsuccessful attempt to blackmail a cop, they find success in Ren√©, a man who pays them in exchange for their silence. Victoria quits her job at the bar. Simon encounters Marianne, a girl he met at the beginning of his trip, and gets her number. The cop tracks Victoria down and viciously beats her. Simon goes out with Marianne and eventually kisses her. He calls Ren√©, claiming to need more money. Simon and Marianne have sex, but he initially makes her uncomfortable. While eating breakfast with her, he gets a call from Victoria asking where he is, and a call from Ren√©'s wife, who says he is missing. When he goes to tell a fed-up Victoria this, she angrily tells him she called Ren√©'s wife. In a rage, Simon beats her and strangles her. He tries to stay with Marianne, but eventually turns to family friend Carlo. He tearfully calls his mother, but hangs up before he can say anything. At the airport, Simon writes a final mental letter to Michelle, stating the only way for them to heal is to distance themselves for a while. He promises to see her soon.

She made three trips to China for the British East India Company (EIC). After the outbreak of war with France in 1793, the Admiralty, desirous of quickly building up the Royal Navy, purchased a number of commercial vessels, including nine East Indiamen, to meet the need for small two-decker fourth rates to serve as convoy escorts. The Admiralty purchased Ceres in 1795 and renamed her HMS Grampus. In 1797 the Admiralty converted her to a storeship. That year her crew participated in the Spithead and Nore mutinies. Grampus grounded in January 1799 and was destroyed. East Indiaman Ceres made three trips to China for the EIC. 1st voyage (1788-89) Ceress captain for her first voyage was Captain Thomas Price. He sailed her for the coast of India and China, leaving Portsmouth on 5 April 1788. She reached Madras on 15 July, and Whampoa on 2 October.

She reached St Helena on 3 July, and Long Reach on 1 September. 3rd voyage (1793-94) George Stevens was again captain of Ceres for her third voyage. She left Portsmouth on 21 May 1793, after war with France had begun on 1 February. The EIC arranged for her to sail under a letter of marque, issued to Stevens, and dated 22 April 1793. Ceres was part of a convoy that also included the East Indiamen Prince William, Lord Thurlow, William Pitt, , Earl of Oxford, , Fort William, London, , , Marquis of Landsdown, , , and Earl of Abergavenny, amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.Gentleman's magazine (May 1793), Vol 63, part. 1, p. 474. On 24 June 1793 the fleet of Indiamen captured the French brig Franc; the crew of Ceres took possession. On 10 November Ceres reached Manila. Then on 20 December she arrived at Whampoa. At Whampoa that December were several other East Indiamen, among which were several that on their return to Britain the Admiralty would purchase: Warley, , Earl of Abergavenny, and . The British Government had chartered Hindostan to take Lord Macartney to China in an unsuccessful attempt to open diplomatic and commercial relations with the Chinese empire. For her return trip, Ceres crossed the Second Bar on 18 February 1794 and stopped at Macao on 16 March. She reached St Helena on 18 June, and Long Reach on 10 September. Royal Navy service The Admiralty purchased Ceres and commissioned her as HMS Grampus in December under Captain Alexander Christie, for the North Sea. (There was already a frigate in the Royal Navy, and a previous fourth-rate had just been sold for breaking up.) The new Grampus was commissioned on 9 March 1795. She then spent some two months with Perry at Blackwall being coppered. In September 1795 Captain John Williamson took command, and in March 1796 he sailed her for Jamaica. Grampus shared with five other naval vessels in the prize money arising out of the capture on 1 April of the French privateer Alexander, and the salvage money from the recapture of her prize, the Portuguese vessel Nostra Signora del Monte del Carmo. Alexander was armed with ten guns and had a crew of 65 men under the command of M. Petre Edite. She was ten days out of Nantz and the capture took place at . Later, the Royal Navy purchased the privateer and took her into service as . In May, Grampus was among the vessels that took part in the campaign to capture Saint Lucia under Rear Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian and General Ralph Abercromby. In September Grampus returned to Britain and was paid off. Two months later she was at Sheerness being fitted as a storeship. Lieutenant Charles Carne recommissioned her in December, with the refitting lasting until February 1797. Mutiny In April and May the Spithead and Nore mutinies broke out. Grampus was one of the vessels caught up in the disorder, and is named in the proclamation read out on 10 June. The exact date of her arrival at Sheerness, the date of her joining the mutiny, and the date of her crew returning to duty are not known. Still, she was at Sheerness by 16 May. At the time, Grampus was preparing for a voyage to the West Indies. After the reading of the Proclamation on 10 June, the crews of a number of vessels sought to abandon the mutiny. On Grampus a fight broke out between loyalists and mutineers, a fight that the mutineer faction won. Under some reports, the mutineers abandoned her. The mutineers on the various vessels involved found Grampus particularly useful because as a storeship, stocked for a voyage, she was able to provide them with supplies. Still, after the reading of the proclamation the mutiny collapsed and by mid-June Grampus had returned to Royal Navy control. After the end of the mutiny, five men from Grampus were sentenced to death. Another account reports that three men were condemned to death and two were confined to solitary cells. Grampus then sailed for Jamaica in August. There her crew began a mutiny in the Jamaica squadron. Return to service In Jamaica, Admiral Hyde Parker, the commander of the station, was concerned that Grampus had brought a disaffected crew that could spread mutiny there too. He identified one agitator, whom he had hanged. By 1798 Grampus was under the command of Captain George Hart, serving as a transport. Fate On the morning of 19 January 1799, Grampus was in the Thames and under the command of Captain John Hall. She weighed at 7a.m., and took a pilot, Sammuel Richardson, on board. Nevertheless, by 9a.m. she had grounded on the Barking Shelf. She could not be refloated and so for the next three days work went on to remove her stores, her masts, and whatever else could be salvaged. On 21 January the decision was made to abandon her as by then she had of water in her hold. The subsequent court martial absolved Captain Hall and his officers and crew of any responsibility, instead blaming Richardson's ignorance. The wreck proved to be an obstacle to navigation so in April, the Commissioners of the Navy issued a call for proposals to \\"remove and clear the River Thames of the Wreck of His Majesty's late Ship Grampus, now on Shore on Barking-Shelf, opposite the Powder-Houses\\". On 12 April 1799, the wreck was set on fire and destroyed.

History Fijians began to migrate in small numbers to the United States in the early 1950s. It was not until 1959 that Fijians began to emigrate in large numbers, emigrating 71 Fijians to the US in this year. In the 1960s more of 400 Fijians emigrated to the United States (mostly in 1968, when emigrated 368 Fijians). Since then the number of Fijian immigrants admitted to the United States has ranged from hundreds to a few thousand people each year. During the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Fijians emigrating legally to the United States rose significantly.

A diagram showing the relationship for flow depth (y) and total Energy (E) for a given flow (Q). Note the location of cricital flow, subcritical flow, and supercritical flow. The energy equation used for open channel flow computations is a simplification of the Bernoulli Equation (See Bernoulli Principle), which takes into account pressure head, elevation head, and velocity head. (Note, energy and head are synonymous in Fluid Dynamics. See Pressure head for more details.) In open channels, it is assumed that changes in atmospheric pressure are negligible, therefore the ‚Äúpressure head‚Äù term used in Bernoulli‚Äôs Equation is eliminated. The resulting energy equation is shown below: :H = z+y+\\\\frac{v^2}{2g} Equation 1 For a given flow rate and channel geometry, there is a relationship between flow depth and total energy. This is illustrated below in the plot of energy vs. flow depth, widely known as an E-y diagram. In this plot, the depth where the minimum energy occurs is known as the critical depth. Consequently, this depth corresponds to a Froude Number (F_n) of 1. Depths greater than critical depth are considered ‚Äúsubcritical‚Äù and have a Froude Number less than 1, while depths less than critical depth are considered supercritical and have Froude Numbers greater than 1. (For more information, see Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow.) :F_n=\\\\frac{v}{(g\\\\frac{A}{B})^{0.5}} Equation 2 Under steady state flow conditions (e.g. no flood wave), open channel flow can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). This depth is analogous to the terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.  Water surface profiles (gradually varied flow)  Typically, the STM is used to develop ‚Äúsurface water profiles,‚Äù or longitudinal representations of channel depth, for channels experiencing gradually varied flow. These transitions can be classified based on reach condition (mild or steep), and also the type of transition being made. Mild reaches occur where normal depth is subcritical (yn > yc) while steep reaches occur where normal depth is supercritical (yn Note: The Steep Reach column should be labeled \\"Steep Reach (yn\\\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\\\frac{S_0 - S_f}{1-F_n^2} Equation 3 This equation (and associated surface water profiles) is based on the following assumptions: :* The slope is relatively small :* Channel cross- section is known at stations of interest :* There is a hydrostatic pressure distribution  Standard step method calculation  The STM numerically solves equation 3 through an iterative process. This can be done using the bisection or Newton-Raphson Method, and is essentially solving for total head at a specified location using equations 4 and 5 by varying depth at the specified location. :H_2 = H_1 - h_f Equation 4 :H_2 = h_{vel} + h_{ele} Equation 5 In order to use this technique, it is important to note you must have some understanding of the system you are modeling. For each gradually varied flow transition, you must know both boundary conditions and you must also calculate length of that transition. (e.g. For an M1 Profile, you must find the rise at the downstream boundary condition, the normal depth at the upstream boundary condition, and also the length of the transition.) To find the length of the gradually varied flow transitions, iterate the ‚Äústep length‚Äù, instead of height, at the boundary condition height until equations 4 and 5 agree. (e.g. For an M1 Profile, position 1 would be the downstream condition and you would solve for position two where the height is equal to normal depth.)  Newton‚ÄìRaphson numerical method  NewtonRaphsonMethod Computer programs like excel contain iteration or goal seek functions that can automatically calculate the actual depth instead of manual iteration.  Conceptual surface water profiles (sluice gate)  Figure 4. Illustration of surface water profiles associated with a sluice gate in a mild reach (top) and a steep reach (bottom). Figure 4 illustrates the different surface water profiles associated with a sluice gate on a mild reach (top) and a steep reach (bottom). Note, the sluice gate induces a choke in the system, causing a ‚Äúbackwater‚Äù profile just upstream of the gate. In the mild reach, the hydraulic jump occurs downstream of the gate, but in the steep reach, the hydraulic jump occurs upstream of the gate. It is important to note that the gradually varied flow equations and associated numerical methods (including the standard step method) cannot accurately model the dynamics of a hydraulic jump. See the Hydraulic jumps in rectangular channels page for more information. Below, an example problem will use conceptual models to build a surface water profile using the STM.  Example problem  The problem statement chosen as an example work-through of the standard step method Solution Calculations necessary for the first step in the standard step method Calculations necessary for the second step in the standard step method Calculations necessary for the third step in the standard step method Using Figure 3 and knowledge of the upstream and downstream conditions and the depth values on either side of the gate, a general estimate of the profiles upstream and downstream of the gate can be generated. Upstream, the water surface must rise from a normal depth of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The only way to do this on a mild reach is to follow an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth at which point a hydraulic jump forms to raise the water surface to the normal depth. Step 4: Use the Newton Raphson Method to solve the M1 and M3 surface water profiles. The upstream and downstream portions must be modeled separately with an initial depth of 9.21 m for the upstream portion, and 0.15 m for the downstream portion. The downstream depth should only be modeled until it reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth, at which point a hydraulic jump will form. The solution presented explains how to solve the problem in a spreadsheet, showing the calculations column by column. Within Excel, the goal seek function can be used to set column 15 to 0 by changing the depth estimate in column 2 instead of iterating manually. Calculations necessary for the fourth step in the standard step method The results of the upstream portion of the standard step method excel calculations Table 1: Spreadsheet of Newton Raphson Method of downstream water surface elevation calculations Step 5: Combine the results from the different profiles and display. Profile upstream Profile downstream Normal depth was achieved at approximately 2,200 meters upstream of the gate. Step 6: Solve the problem in the HEC-RAS Modeling Environment: It is beyond the scope of this Wikipedia Page to explain the intricacies of operating HEC-RAS. For those interested in learning more, the HEC-RAS user‚Äôs manual is an excellent learning tool and the program is free to the public. The first two figures below are the upstream and downstream water surface profiles modeled by HEC-RAS. There is also a table provided comparing the differences between the profiles estimated by the two different methods at different stations to show consistency between the two methods. While the two different methods modeled similar water surface shapes, the standard step method predicted that the flow would take a greater distance to reach normal depth upstream and downstream of the gate. This stretching is caused by the errors associated with assuming average gradients between two stations of interest during our calculations. Smaller dx values would reduce this error and produce more accurate surface profiles. HEC-RAS upstream HEC-RAS Downstream The HEC-RAS model calculated that the water backs up to a height of 9.21 meters at the upstream side of the sluice gate, which is the same as the manually calculated value. Normal depth was achieved at approximately 1,700 meters upstream of the gate. HEC-RAS modeled the hydraulic jump to occur 18 meters downstream of the sluice gate.

The two fell in love, and Vallet left Girot to move in with Flandrin in Rue Campagne-Premi√®re, in the Montparnasse area. She would live with him as his companion for 20 years.Petteys, Chris, '‚ÄôDictionary of Women Artists'‚Äô, G K Hill & Co. publishers, 1985 Vallet's first works were rejected from the 1900 Salon des Ind√©pendants, but she succeeded in having a dozen paintings shown in that exhibition the following year, under the pseudonym of Jacqueline Marval.

In 1902, several of her paintings were displayed alongside works by Flandrin, Albert Marquet, and Henri Matisse in a gallery in Rue Victor-Mass√© curated by Berthe Weill, who was particularly interested in promoting the works of female artists living in Paris.

Biography His acts are thus related by Challoner: :A certain Protestant minister, for some misdemeanour put into York Castle, to reinstate himself in the favour of his superiors, insinuated himself into the good opinion of the Catholic prisoners, by pretending a deep sense of repentance, and a great desire of embracing the Catholic truth . . . So they directed him, after he was enlarged, to Mr. Henry Abbot, a zealous convert who lived in Holden in the same country, to procure a priest to reconcile him . . . Mr. Abbot carried him to Carlton to the house of Esquire Stapleton, but did not succeed in finding a priest. Soon after, the traitor having got enough to put them all in danger of the law, accused them to the magistrates . . . They confessed that they had explained to him the Catholic Faith, and upon this they were all found guilty and sentenced to die.Ryan, Patrick W.F. \\"Henry Abbot.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

The film stars original returning cast members Andy Lau and Nick Cheung with new cast members Natalis Chan, Kelly Lin, Meggie Yu, Alex Man and Jewel Lee in her debut film role. The film was partially filmed in the Caesars Palace Resort, Las Vegas. Plot The story directly follows The Conman, where Dragon's sister, Ching, has left to study in Canada. After King and Dragon defeat Macau Mon, they become swindling partners. Along with Dragons' older cousin Luk Chard, the trio try swindling a large amount of money from Big Eyed Man at his underground casino. While the trio are enjoying themselves, unexpectedly, Man sends people to kill them and kidnap Dragon. King and Luk Chard are brought to the Senior Chinese Front. It turns out that they want to hire them to go to Las Vegas to complete a task: to catch Peter Chu, a man who was in charge of multiple Tofu-dreg projects in the past few years in China, and then stole a large amount of money and fled to the United States. Because Chu is backed by many American politicians and organised gangs, they could not use diplomatic and legal channels to extradite him, they could only send a few gambling experts to catch him in the Caesars Palace casino where he visits daily. King and Luk would receive $120,000,000 as a reward. Since King needs to give $30,000,000 to Big Eyed Man to rescue Dragon, he accepts the task and goes to Las Vegas with Luk Chard. Upon arriving in Las Vegas, King and Luk Chard encounters two gorgeous ladies Betty and Sammi, whom they previously met in Hong Kong. The four of them set a trap where Sammi seduces Chu and successfully capture him, but Chu has secretly notified his henchmen and girlfriend, Fei-fei, who are waiting for the arrival of the four at the airport, so King decides to escort Chu via a road trip to Los Angeles and board a flight there. However, Chu tries to break free on the way, which startles the bus driver and passengers, causing the four and Chu to travel on foot in the desert, where both Chu and Luk Chard suffer from rattlesnake bites. Luckily, King encounters his friend, adult film director Handsome Wu, who was filming in the desert. Wu helps King stage a rescue attack using cinematic effects to fool Chu and successfully escorts the latter back to China to be taken by the SCF, who have rescued Dragon from Big Eyed Man The FBI was able to retrieve the stolen money after King and Handsome trick Chu into revealing the password of his safe. In the end, King and Betty also become lovers.

Early life Eugene Lorton was born on a farm in Montgomery County, Missouri, near Middletown on May 28, 1869. His father, R. R. Lorton, was a farmer and stock raiser who also worked on farms in Kansas and Texas. In his youth, Eugene attended public schools in Missouri and Kansas, before starting work as a printer's apprentice in Medicine Lodge, Kansas.

He became active in politics and was elected mayor of Mound City. In 1900, he moved to Walla Walla, Washington where he became managing editor of the Walla Walla Daily Union and founded the Walla Walla Daily Bulletin. He also raised his political activity by becoming campaign manager for Governor Cosgrove. When Cosgrove was elected, he appointed Lorton as the chairman of the state board of control.

With Foreman's popularity at an all-time high coupled with the fact that he could possibly become the oldest Heavyweight champion in boxing history, anticipation for the bout was high. As such, the two fighters received high payouts, Holyfield was guaranteed $20 million, while Foreman took home a guaranteed $12.5 million.

At the beginning of the round, Holyfield was the aggressor, throwing several jabs as Foreman stood back, seemingly waiting for an opportunity to land a powerful right hand. Seconds later, Holyfield missed with a left hook, which led to Foreman countering with a big right hook to Holyfield's head. Foreman would then become the aggressor and continue his attack on Holyfield, landing several punches within the round's first minute. As the second minute of the round began, Holyfield rebounded and proceeded to land a 15-second, multiple punch combination that staggered Foreman. Though Holyfield's barrage of punches seemed to tire Foreman, he nevertheless was able to survive the remainder of the round without going down. This round was ultimately named \\"Round of the Year\\" by The Ring magazine. Though Foreman was able to stay competitive throughout the fight, Holyfield ultimately won the fight via unanimous decision, winning all three judges scorecards by scores of 116‚Äì111, 115‚Äì112, and 117‚Äì110. Foreman, however, impressed many by going the distance with the much younger champion.No Joke, Sports Illustrated article, 1991-04-29, Retrieved on 2013-05-15 Aftermath The fight was a huge success financially, becoming for a time the highest-grossing boxing match of all time.

The relation states that for solids where the contribution of the dielectric constant to the index of refraction is negligible, the reflection coefficient can be written as (in SI Units): R\\\\approx1-2\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\epsilon_0\\\\omega}{\\\\sigma}} where \\\\omega is the frequency of observation, \\\\sigma is the conductivity, and \\\\epsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity.

Mish may be similar to cheese that has been found in the tomb of the First Dynasty Pharaoh Hor-Aha at Saqqara, from 3200 BC. It is generally prepared at home, although some is sold in local markets. When ripe it is a yellowish-brown color, and tastes sharp, salty and pungent. Products similar to Mish are made commercially from different types of Egyptian cheese such as Domiati or Ras, with different ages. Preparation Mish is usually made at home from Karish cheese. The cheese is drained, rinsed and layered with salt in an earthenware jar. The jar is then filled with a pickling solution of buttermilk, sour skim milk, whey, red and green peppers. Some old mish is added to start the fermentation. The sealed container is then left for a year or more at ambient temperature. The container may be opened so that some can be removed for consumption, and fresh cheese and other ingredients added, so there is no particular limit to the age of mish. In popular culture The phrase, \\"it's everywhere, like mish\\" means that something is common. Tiny worms often breed in the mish, but are not dangerous. The saying \\"the worms of the mish arise from it\\" means it is a problem that cannot be solved, but is not worth worrying about. The maggots comes from flies laying eggs on the cottage cheese that is left to drain on a straw mat, by the farmer in the open air. If Mish is prepared in a factory, it does not contain any maggots.

Danske Dagblades Forening [19 July 2009] ECR I-6569 was a decision of the European Court of Justice concerning the interpretation of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright, and the conditions for exemption of temporary acts of reproduction. It established that (1) an act occurring during a data capture process is within the concept of reproduction in part within the meaning of Article 2 of Directive 2001/29, if the elements reproduced are the expression of the intellectual creation of their author, and (2) the act of printing out an extract of words during a data capture process does not fulfill the condition of being transient in nature as required by Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29. Facts Infopaq, a media monitoring and analysis business, was engaged in sending customers selected summarized articles from Danish daily newspapers and other periodicals by email. The articles were selected on the basis of certain subject criteria agreed with by customers and made available by means of a data capture process. Danske Dagblades Forening (DDF), a professional association of Danish daily newspaper publishers, assists its members with copyright issues. DDF became aware that Infopaq was scanning newspaper articles for commercial purposes without authorization and complained to Infopaq about this procedure. The data capture process comprises five phases. First, the publications are registered manually in an electronic registration database. Secondly, the publications are scanned, creating a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) file created for each page. When scanning is completed, the TIFF file is transferred to an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) server. Thirdly, the OCR server translates the TIFF file into data that can be processed digitally. During that process, the image of each letter is translated into a character code which tells the computer what type of letter it is. The OCR process is completed by deleting the TIFF file. Fourthly, the text file is processed to find a search word defined beforehand. In order to make it easier to find the search word when reading the article, the five words which come before and after the search word are captured. At the end of the process the text file is deleted. Fifthly, at the end of the data capture process, a cover sheet is printed out for of all the pages where the relevant search word was found. Procedural history Infopaq disputed DDF's claim that the procedure required consent from the rightholders and brought an action against DDF before the √òstre Landsret (Eastern Regional Court), claiming that DDF should be ordered to acknowledge that Infopaq is entitled in Denmark to apply the above-mentioned procedure without the consent of DDF or of its members. After the √òstre Landsret dismissed that action, Infopaq brought an appeal before the H√∏jesteret, Denmark's highest court. The parties disagreed whether there was reproduction as contemplated by Article 2 of Directive 2001/29, as well as whether, if there is reproduction, the acts in question were covered by the exemption from the right of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of that directive. The H√∏jesteret court then referred 13 questions to the European Court of Justice. The first was if the storing and subsequent printing out of a text extract from an article in a daily newspaper, consisting of a search word and the five preceding and five subsequent words, can be regarded as an act of reproduction protected under Article 2 of Directive 2001/29. Questions 2-12 related to whether acts of reproduction occurring during a data capture process satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 (the act is temporary; transient or incidental; is an integral and essential part of a technological process; and the sole purpose is to enable transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or a lawful use of a work or protected subject-matter; and the act has no independent economic significance), thereby not requiring consent of the relevant right holders. The thirteenth question related to whether this data capture process can be regarded as constituting a special case which does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the newspaper articles and not unreasonably prejudicing the legitimate interests of the right holder as specified in Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29. Judgment The ECJ held that printing is not transient in nature and consent was needed for Infopaq to use the publication. In response to the first question, an 11-word extract of a protected work is a reproduction in part within the meaning of Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC, if the words reproduced are the expression of the intellectual creation of the author. The ECJ stated that it was for the national courts of EU countries to decide when such a reproduction is the author's expression of intellectual creation. In response to questions 2-12, the act of printing out an 11-word extract during a data capture process does not fulfill the condition of being transient in nature as required by Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 and, therefore, that process cannot be carried out without the consent of the relevant right holders. In light of the answer to questions 2-12, it was not necessary for the ECJ to address question 13. Significance This case highlights the problems of copyright infringement and new technology in new business models, especially those involving content aggregation. This decision is considered to have had a high impact on fundamental principles of copyright law, in concluding that the European standard of originality (the author's own intellectual creation) applies not only in the limited contexts to which it has been applied in legislation such as software, photographs and databases; but to all Berne Convention \\"works\\" under the European acquis.

Raised in a Reform family, he later found himself drawn to greater observance and became Orthodox, a change which influenced his music. While attending The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, he became involved with the Olympia music scene as half of the hip hop duo Saints of Everyday Failures, with which he released two albums. According to Nic Leonard of the Weekly Volcano, Eprhyme \\"played a major roll [sic] in the creation of the Olympia hip-hop scene.\\" He was noticed by local independent label K Records, who released his first two singles, \\"Punklezmerap\\" and \\"Shomer Salaam\\". He then released his debut album, Waywordwonderwill (2009), through Shemspeed Records, before returning to K Records for his follow-up, Dopestylevsky (2011). He is currently part of the alternative hip hop group Darshan with singer-songwriter Shir Yaakov and Basya Schechter.  Biography   Early life  Eden Pearlstein was born February 19, 1980, in Phoenix, Arizona. He grew up in a Reform Jewish household, later describing it as \\"a standard non-Orthodox West Coast Jewish upbringing‚ÄîHebrew school, bar mitzvah, and summer camp. It was not very intriguing to me and I just walked away from it after my bar mitzvah.\\" He listened to hip hop as a child and began rapping when he was 14. During his middle school years, he became rebellious and dabbled in drugs and petty crime until, at age 17, he attended a youth arts program and became interested in poetry. In his early twenties, he visited North Dakota to participate in a Native American Sun Dance, during which he had a spiritual epiphany that inspired him to re-examine his Jewish roots. Early music in Olympia Pearlstein attended The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, where he studied comparative theology and led classes in Alternative Jewish studies on the side. During this time, he became involved in the Olympia music scene, working with producer Matt \\"Smoke\\" Smokovich of Oldominion. He also co-founded the hip hop group Saints of Everyday Failures alongside D-Scribe, Tha Goonie, MC Contradiction, and My Left Foot. They performed at the 2006 Lakefair festival alongside One Block Radius and released two albums together, True Meaning of Survival (2005) and The State of the Art is Failure (2006), the latter of which featured contributions by Awol One, 2Mex, Onry Ozzborn, and members of Typical Cats. The album's sound was described by Weekly Volcano as \\"a s√©ance with John Coltrane, Hermann Hesse, and Public Enemy.\\" Solo career Eprhyme gained the attention of K Records, who released his first two solo singles, \\"Punklezmerap\\", which featured Nomy Lamm on vocals, and \\"Shomer Salaam\\". This made him the label's first hip hop artist in a decade, as they were primarily associated with punk and indie rock artists. In 2009, Eprhyme relocated to New York City, where he became a regular at SOB's. That same year, he released his debut album, Waywordwonderwill, through Shemspeed Records. In March 2010, Eprhyme performed at the Sandys Row Synagogue in London as part of a Moishe House event. Eprhyme returned to K Records in 2011 for his second album, Dopestylevsky. The album featured more collaborations, including Labtekwon, DeScribe, Y-Love, and AKA. In 2014, Eprhyme and Smoke M2D6, producing under the name Thee Xntrx, released All Your Friend's Friends, a compilation of Pacific Northwest rappers sampling older K Records artists. Those on the compilation included The Chicharones, MG! The Visionary, Oldominion, and Eprhyme himself.

The \\"Zimmerman Rule\\", named for him, prevents individuals who trade in the Chicago exchanges to profit from trades made over stipulated limits. Zimmerman ran twice for mayor of Vancouver, both times unsuccessfully. Early life and education Zimmerman was raised in Vernon, British Columbia. He was inspired to be a broker by an E. F. Hutton television ad, the life of a local successful broker, and Dr. Bruce G. Gould's How to Make Money in Commodities book. Zimmerman studied music at Western Washington University. Career Floor trader =Singer-Wenger= After working briefly trading in the Vancouver financial market, Zimmerman moved to Chicago and became a trader at the Chicago Board of Trade in 1985; He worked first as an entry-level clerk on the floor. Partly due to Zimmerman's \\"unusual speed\\" making financial calculations in his head, he was hired to work for the Singer-Wenger at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; He was first assigned to the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Price Index futures pit and then the live cattle futures options. He was fired on \\"Black Monday\\" (October 19, 1987) when he made risky and unauthorized transactions as the market was crashing; he lost $60,000. His wife, with whom he was arguing that day about his risky transactions, also lost her job at the exchange. =Other trading positions= Between 1987 and 1992 Zimmerman worked at a number of positions, but had a hard time dealing with the more complicated, risky market after Black Monday (1987). He often started situations successfully, and then was fired for his risky, unsuccessful and unauthorized trades; Zimmerman made puts and calls transactions above stipulated limits. Zimmerman then worked independently. The market was volatile when the Gulf War commenced [January 17, 1991]. He engaged in risky transactions which resulted in the loss of $150,000. He lost his seat on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 20 days after it had been acquired and he owed First Commercial Financial Group $70,000. One of the people who staked him in exchange for a share of his profits said, \\"Going through the markets is like going through psychoanalysis... If you have any self-destructive tendencies, the market is going to find them and hit you with them.\\" =Lee B. Stern & Company= Floor trader By 1992 Zimmerman was a floor trader at Lee B. Stern & Company where his \\"questionable billion- dollar trades jolted the Treasury bond market\\". On October 22, 1992, Zimmerman controlled $1.2 billion of futures on US 30-year treasury bonds backed by a bad check for $50,000. Unable to pay $8.5 million in margin calls, Lee B. Stern's owners' exchange memberships were suspended. Zimmerman's trading privileges were revoked. Anthony Catalfo was named as an accomplice; both men were accused of trying to make a fortune by ignoring the limits placed on the trades. The men were accused of \\"taking a large stake in options that would make money if the price of Treasury bonds fell. They then sold a large number of Treasury bond futures contracts, which insured the price would drop.\\" The market did just that, but before the bonds could be sold the price rebounded and then increased, resulting in a loss of $8.5 million. Journalist Ted Fishman wrote: > By the time Zimmerman was hauled out of the pits by Board of Trade security > guards, he had ruined an old-line trading firm, threatened the Board of > Trade with its first default in history, raised serious doubts about its > trading system, and changed forever the way business on the world's futures > exchanges is done. Lee Stern covered the $8.5 million loss ($1.5 million from Catolfo), was forced to liquidate his company and subsequently rebuilt his status in the market. Arraignment Zimmerman left Chicago for Canada in July, 1993, just prior to his arraignment on federal fraud charges. In an interview with Worth Magazine several months later, Zimmerman commented upon the incident: > I thought then, \\"I'm a multimillionaire, I control the market now...\\" You > spend half of every day thinking about what would happen if you could trade > large enough to move a market by yourself, to play like the big firms and > banks do. I had everyone in the pit coming to me. I was the market. The > exchanges just don't want to admit the market can be controlled by one guy, > especially by someone like me, but I proved it can. Almost. Zimmerman worked for a short time for Hera Resources, a gold and silver mining company in Canada. He was hired partly to assist with investor relations. He was to have received stock options at Hera, but when the company tried to file the transaction the connection was made by exchange investigators to Zimmerman's Chicago indictment. He was fired immediately from his job. Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Zimmerman in November 1993 and fought extradition to the United States for several years. Conviction, extradition and capture In June 1994, while Zimmerman was evading extradition, Anthony Catalfo was convicted of six counts of fraud and sentenced to 42 months in jail. He was convicted in 1995 of wire fraud for trying to manipulate the market. Zimmerman was arrested in Canada in July 1996, extradited back to the United States, and in September of that year pleaded guilty to two of six counts of wire fraud. He spent two years in jail, serving some time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Zimmerman rule His actions caused the Chicago Board of Trade and all Chicago exchanges to implement what has unofficially been called the \\"Zimmerman rule\\" prohibiting traders from profiting after having traded above the limit of their account; The clearing firms are allowed to keep the profits. Advocacy and politics Zimmerman unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Vancouver as an independent candidate in 2005. In 2011 Zimmerman, resident of the Art Gallery encampment of the Occupy Vancouver Movement, tried to steal the Vancouver's City Hall's portrait of Christy Clark, the Premier of British Columbia. He was arrested and charged with theft, but was released after promising to stay out of City Hall. He was a candidate for mayor in 2011. As a member of a group of Occupy Vancouver protesters he disrupted a mayoral debate on the subject of homelessness from which he had been excluded. Having caused a disturbance, Zimmerman was removed from the event. Musical career He appeared on the album Bandas de la Portales with Andres Motta and Gabriel Lauber issued by Jazzorca Records. Zimmerman played with Remi Alvarez, Hernan Hecht, Carlos Alegre, German Bringas, Itzam Cano, and Gabriel Lauber on the 2007 Free Radical Jazz.http://jazzorca.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cadence-apr-may- jun-2009-111.pdf It was recorded live at Cafe Jazzorca by Jazzorca Records. Zimmerman plays the saxophone and trumpet. Personal life In June 1987, Zimmerman married Lisa Tatkus, whom he met while working at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They had taken a trip to Canada but Zimmerman was not allowed to return to the United States without a work permit; The couple then married. Between 1987 and 1992, Zimmerman made and lost tens of thousands of dollars; He lost positions for his unsuccessful, unauthorized sales. During that time the couple experienced financial disarray and moved several times to better and then less expensive housing. Zimmerman allegedly pawned his wife's wedding ring and other jewelry to buy a bus ticket to Canada, and left a note for his wife that said he was taking a vacation, although Lisa had found the jewelry, including the wedding ring, in her belongings about a month later. Several years later, they have divorced. After October 22, 1992, Lisa was also barred from the trading floor, not for her trading history but through association with her husband. When Zimmerman was imprisoned, Lisa was the only person on Zimmerman's visitor list. Zimmerman wrote in articles published in the Mexican business magazine, Expansion, that he came to Mexico with his family and was playing in the Mexican free jazz scene. After two years in Mexico he returned to Vancouver.

It is a sub-category within the field of material flow analysis (MFA), which is a method to quantitatively analyze the flows of materials used for industrial production in an industry or economy. MFA is a useful tool to assess what impacts materials used in the industrial process have and how efficiently a given process uses them. Material criticality evaluation criteria consist of three dimensions: supply risk, vulnerability to supply restriction, and environmental implications. Supply risk comprises several components, and changes based on short or long-term temporal outlooks. Vulnerability to supply restriction is dependent on the organizational level (global, national, and corporate). This methodology was developed from a United States National Research Council model, and is intended to help stakeholders make strategic decisions about the materials used in their production process. In the globalized economy, scarcity of essential materials in the industrial supply chain is a growing concern. As a result, nations and other large institutions are increasingly analyzing a material's criticality and seek to minimize any risk, restriction, or environmental impact associated with the material.  Supply risk  Supply risk is one of three dimensions that determine a material's criticality. Supply risk can be evaluated for the medium term (5‚Äì10 years, typically most appropriate for corporations and governments) and the long term (multiple decades, usually considered by long- range planners, futurists, and sustainability scholars). Supply risk consists of three components: Geological, Technological, and Economic; Social and Regulatory; Geopolitical. The first component focuses on the availability of the material's supply and the last two focus on how access to that supply could be restricted. The components are assessed on a 0-100 scale for both medium and long-term risk with higher values indicating higher risk. The aggregated scores yield a material's supply risk.  Geological, Technological, and Economic  The geological, technological and economic components of supply risk relate to the most basic questions relating to a materials availability; geologically, how much (material) is there; technologically, is it feasible to obtain; and economically, is it practical to do so. This component comprises two indicators of equal weight. The first looks at the relative abundance of material resulting in \\"depletion time\\" or relatively how much of the material has not been consumed. The second is a percentage of a given material extracted as a companion or trace material extracted as a by-product. This is used to understand depletion rates of materials consumed as a by-product to extraction. Quoting Graedel et al., \\"One should not regard the result as how long it will be until we run out, but rather as a useful relative indicator of the contemporary balance between supply and demand for the metal in question.\\" In practice, geological, technological, economic, political and other aspects of criticality are interconnected. For example, new exploration technologies can alter geological availability, shortages can lead to higher prices which can in turn promote technological innovation.  Social and Regulatory  The social and regulatory components of a materials supply risk can impede or expedite the development of mineral resources. Regulations can hinder the reliability of mineral resource supply. Social perceptions towards the negative environmental and socioeconomic effects on communities typically fuel these regulations. Material criticality employs the policy potential index (PPI) and human development index (HDI) indicators to quantify the social and regulatory components of supply risk evaluation.  Geopolitical  The geopolitical component of a material's supply risk takes into account how governmental decisions and stability can significantly impact a material's accessibility. For example, politically unstable and war-torn nations pose a greater risk to supply restriction than developed peaceful nations. Material concentration, geographic location, security, socio-economic distress, and political stability are all analyzed to address what amount the geopolitical component should factor into a material's supply risk.  Metal scarcity  Metals are among the most important materials to the industrialized world, everything from infrastructure to personal electronic devices heavily relies on metals for production. As a result, global supply is being increasingly monitored and examined. For example, a recent study analyzed the varying levels of risk to the copper metals around the world. Another study found that increasing metal scarcity could alter typical industrial behavior. It also noted that metals heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas, such as strontium in China or the platinum group in South Africa and Russia; pose greater risk for supply disruptions. Since the late 1990s China has had a near monopoly on a variety of rare-earth metals commonly used in every day products. Much to the surprise of the international trade community China began restricting exports of these metals in 2009. The U.S. and World Trade Organization immediately protested however China has not changed its stance. This is a great example of a geopolitical based supply risk. To combat this supply disruption other countries, such as Japan, are attempting new and innovative methods of mining these rare-earth metals.  Vulnerability to Supply Restriction  Vulnerability to Supply Restriction (VSR) is an index that tells us how likely a particular element is to be restricted due to usage and availability. What evaluates the importance of a particular element at a social, economic and political level can be evaluated at three organizational levels; corporate, national and global levels. In total, it comprises eight indicator categories for the Corporate and National level, and 4 for the Global. VSR is important in evaluating each significant end-use applications of a material separately. The current approach realizes that indicators may be common or be specific for one to two. The three organizational levels use an adjusted 0-100 scale, including 4 bins, each with a range of 25 points. Quantifying the VSR is based on materials importance and substitutability, and an ability to innovate can be included at some organizational levels.  Global  VSR at the Global level is focused on the intrinsic value of a material to the society of a country or countries and to what level a substitution is possible. It is not a short term evaluation and none of its indicators are evaluated as such. The global levels matrix does not include as many categories as the Corporate and National level VSR evaluations are. They are only evaluated by the Importance and Substitutability. 1) Importance This consists of an indicator labeled percentage of population utilizing. 2) Substitutability This comprises substitute performance, substitute availability, and the environmental impact ratio.  National  Introduce national vulnerability to supply restriction: Looks at importance of an element, but does it through domestic industries and the country's population. It is evaluated on either a short or long term, and can be regarded as more intermediate in time. 1) Importance Composed of two indicators: national economic importance and percentage of population utilizing element. 2) Substitutability Indicators are the same as at the corporate level except for that Price ratio is now labeled Net Importance price ratio. 3) Susceptibility This is no longer labeled ‚Äúability to innovate‚Äù as it was at the corporate level. It is now ‚ÄúSusceptibility‚Äù and its indicator is no longer Corporate Innovation. The focus is now (1) net importance reliance (2) global innovation index.  Corporate  At the corporate level VSR is used to find the importance of an element in regards to (1) corporations current product lines (2) corporations Future product lines; with economic considerations each. (3) Ability to innovate. The corporate level is used to reinforce the belief that these innovative corporations are adapting more quickly to supply restriction. Emphasis on economic considerations. There is a development of sets of varied scenarios so that an estimate for how they might evolve is available. 1) Importance Two indicators: national economic importance and percentage of population utilizing. 2) Substitutability Substitutability evaluates (1) Substitute Performance (2) Substitute Availability (3) Environmental Impact Ration (4) Price Ratio. This evaluates the possible implications of an alternative material or metal in case the one at hand has a larger environmental impact or is in short supply. 3) Ability to Innovate A corporation that uses natural resources is dependent upon that resource and a disruption in its supply can impact revenues and market share. A competitor's ability to find a substitute or more efficient means of extraction could overtake a corporation. Toyota vs Ford and Lithium Lithium Ion Battery Lithium is used in Toyota and Ford cars' electric car batteries. Lithium is an ECE (energy critical elements) and is also a non-renewable resource. About 100 times more lithium is necessary in an electric car battery as is necessary for a standard laptop battery.Koerner. The Saudi Arabia of Lithium https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1124/034.html/ With new practices of car companies trying to wane off fossil fuel usage, it is important to note the increased demand for lithium for automakers. At the corporate level, lithium must be evaluated in terms of its importance to the company, and see to what extent a substitute is possible in short term values. It is important to note that both Ford and Toyota's current and most used batteries in Electric cars are Lithium-ion. Ford Motor company's senior manager of energy storage research stated, ‚ÄúThere are foreseen limits of lithium ion technology,‚Äù this was stated in coordination with a graph estimating a diminishing number by 2017. . According to Toyota's environmental technology corporate strategy, ‚ÄúAs Toyota anticipates the widespread use of electric vehicles in the future, we have begun research in developing next- generation secondary batteries with performance that greatly exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries.‚Äù Toyota. Research Progress: Next Generation Secondary Batteries. 2013. / Lithium mine, Salar del Hombre Muerto, ArgentinaAt the National level, one would evaluate a nation in which lithium is in high supply. These include: Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Afghanistan and Tibet. The high demand of car companies and electric extensive products requiring lithium reserves would bring large revenues into these resource rich nations. Lithium production has a very large incentive for a country. A ton of lithium can sell for anywhere between $4500 and $5200, and the purer lithium that is used in batteries sells at the upper end of that interval. Bolivia's current reserve is estimated to be around 100 million tons Bill Moore.

In terms of the population utilizing lithium, there is a relatively large number of people using lithium, with technology encompassing a large percent of our interactions and activities in the world. With some villages in Africa operating more cell phones than bathrooms, it is reasonable to estimate a large percent of the world uses lithium, and to predict that the material usage will increase as industrialization and technological dependency grows.New World. Lithium Facts. A New Age of Mineral Exploration in the Americas. New World Resource Corporation. / In terms of Toyota and Ford's lithium usage, it is important to note that as of 2005, global zinc air production could produce enough zinc-air batteries to power 1 billion electric vehicles, and lithium reserves could only power ten million lithium-ion powered vehicles .  Environmental implication  Copper Mine The burden that various materials impose on the environment is considered in material criticality. There are numerous negative effects that materials can have on the environment due to either their toxicity, the amounts of energy and water used in processing, and their emissions into the air, water and the land. The purpose of including an evaluation of environmental implications is to transfer information on potential impacts of using a specific material to product designers, government officials, and nongovernmental agencies. The environmental implication evaluation can use data from a source like the Ecoinvent Database. The ecoinvent database provides a single score for the negative impact to human health and ecosystems on a scale from 0-100. The scope of the score is Cradle to Gate. Environmental implications can also be reflected in social attitudes that may pose as a barrier to the development of resources in the form of objections to extraction. These objections may arise from a fear of how the new extraction site could potentially negatively impact the surrounding communities and ecosystems. This barrier can affect the reliability and security of resources. Improved technology and infrastructure in the recycling re-use, and more efficient use of materials could mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts associated with them. This could also improve the reliability and security of resources. An example of environmental implications is the ban on lead (Pb) in many products. Once government officials and product designers became aware of the dangers of lead government and company policies started prohibiting its use.  Criticality focus  Material criticality is a relatively new field of research. As global industrial activity continues to increase a wide array of stakeholders are paying more attention to material criticality in order to assess how production processes may be impacted and made more efficient. British Petroleum, the United States Department of Energy, and the European Union have all established review procedures to determine material criticality and how it affects their behavior. Additionally, there has been a growing body of academic study in this field, led by Thomas Graedel of Yale. Material criticality is going to be an essential factor in the industrial production process for the foreseeable future.

It was determined to be eligible for listing in 1984, but the then-current owner objected. Subsequent changes to the house, however, did not ruin the historic integrity of the house, so in 2007 under a later owner it was possible to list the property. The house was built between 1883 and 1885 for David E. Davis. The brick house was one of the earliest of its kind in the Rush Valley area. Davis, a polygamist, built the house for his three wives and their families. In the update documentation for NRHP listing, it was noted that a new owner discovered what was probably a \\"polygamy pit\\": a hidden room where polygamist David E. Davis might have hidden from U.S. marshals seeking his arrest. The room, which could also have been a root cellar, is the size of a small bedroom and hidden below the rear room of the house, with access by a ladder. Since the apparent finishing of the room was more refined than needed for a root cellar, it is believed this in fact was meant for, and may well have been used as, a hiding place.

The beverages themselves are also reflective of the country's geography, climate, and cultures. South Korea's interest in creating its own alcohol came about during the Koryo Dynasty (946‚Äì943), when exposure to foreign cultures and the introduction of distilled water created the basis and technique for distilling a unique alcohol.  History of South Korean drinking culture  South Korea has a long tradition of consuming alcohol to celebrate holidays and seasonal events, in which they honor ancestors and exchange goodwill with neighbors and friends. Some of the holidays included New Year, Rice planting and South Korea's Day of Thanks. Hongdo Kim, \\"Lunch\\"  Farming  Drinking alcohol is often correlated with a season's passing and its related farming activities. Once the harvest has ended farmers would spend their downtime brewing and fermenting alcohol as they looked forward to the spring. South Korean ancestors often drank a glass of rice-wine (Takju) accompanied by a light breakfast snack (Saecham) before they left for the fields in the morning. Traditional South Korean music (Nongak) would play while they worked.  Korean New Year  Upon the new year Korean ancestors consumed Soju to drive out disease and bad spirits, the word 'Soju' meaning a welcoming spring. One type of Soju is called Dosoju, made with medicinal herbs and refined rice wine. Alcohol consumption was also used to medicate both adults and children during illnesses. Because alcohol was held in such high regard, Korean ancestors took great pains to pass down drinking customs from generation to generation.  Daeboreum  The 15th day of the New Year according to the lunar calendar is a traditional South Korean holiday. Many attend moon-viewing events all over the country for the new year's first full moon. On that night, Koreans drink Daeboreium or \\"ear-quickening wine\\" in hopes of hearing good news quickly for the next year. While children do not drink the alcohol they are encouraged to place their lips to the glass, then pour the wine in a chimney to deter sickness and vaporization. Each region gave their own name to the beverage. Yun-bok Shin 'Danopungjeong'  Dano  The fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar is called ‚ÄòDano‚Äô. This is an important holiday and celebrates the transplanting of rice seedlings and the time of year when yin energy is weakest and yang energy is strongest. The custom during ‚ÄòDano‚Äô was/is to hold a memorial service for their ancestors and toast the day with a drink mixed with sweet flag called Changpoju. The properties in the drink were said to dispel evil spirits, providing escape from misfortune and promote health and longevity. During this era most Koreans practiced Confucianism which prohibited women and certain other members of society from drinking alcohol or pouring it for someone else. However, in modern times anyone can partake in the customs.  Alcohol drinking etiquette  Koreans have strict rules of etiquette in drinking alcoholic beverages. When receiving a glass from an elder, one must hold the glass with two hands (left palm at the bottom and hold the glass with the right hand) and bow the head slightly. When it is time to drink, the drinker must turn away from the elder, and cover the mouth and glass with their hands. The first drink must be finished in one shot. When the glass is empty, the drinker hands it back to the person who poured the drink for them and the drinker then pours them a shot. This starts a series of glass and bottle passes around the table. By the middle of 1300s, manners and culture of drinking came into South Korea. There are many manners about drinking alcohol in South Korea. Among them is a typical manner of drinking culture called Hyangeumjurye(Ìñ•ÏùåÏ£ºÎ°Ä)'. It was an event that saw many classical and Confucian scholars gather and drink, learning drinking manners. It also meant that people had to respect benevolent persons and support old men. It was held every October. Within 'Hyanguemjurye, the most important thing about South Korea drinking culture is manners. Koreans believed drinking etiquette is important. When people become of age to drink alcohol, they are taught how to drink with other people by elders, because Korean ancestors thought that pouring and receiving drinks was important over the bowl.  Pouring drinks  In South Korea, it is traditional that when a person gives an alcoholic drink to another adult, the person has to offer the drink respectfully with two hands. When pouring a drink, the bottle should be held with the right hand, and the wrist of your right hand held lightly with the left hand. It is customary to wait until the glass is empty to pour another.  Receiving drinks  There is also a tradition for receiving drinks. When receiving drinks, the same etiquette applies when pouring drinks. When elders give alcohol to a younger person, the younger person should receive the drink politely and with gratitude by saying \\"thank you\\". The next step is to hit the bottle, and then put it down. This pleases the elders. Also, when drinking beer, it is proper for the younger drinker to turn their head, so as to not directly face the elders when drinking.  Modern Korean drinking culture  Bomb drink by beer and hard liquor Makgeolli and bindaetteok As society developed, the drinking culture started to change. In the past, people drank on specific days like New Year's, but presently alcohol can be consumed regardless of the occasion. The goal of drinking parties is to promote good fellowship and open one's heart to talking. Some other aspects are beginning to adapt to modern ways as well; Koreans are changing to enjoy drinking all kinds of alcohol. They also like to make special cocktails like \\"bomb drink\\" or \\"poktanju\\". A \\"bomb drink\\" is a mixed drink similar to the American boilermaker‚Äîa whiskey shot sunk into a glass of beer. In Korea, many people like \\"poktanju\\". Examples are soju and (mekju) beer = Somek, foreign liquors and beers, and soju, beer and coke (kojingamlae). Poktanju makes people inebriated fairly quickly; nevertheless, people enjoy drinking it and drink it bottoms up. There are many Poktanju, with many new ones becoming famous, including 'red eye' and 'meakkiss', and commonly mix alcohol with other liquids such as milk, tomato juice, coke and coffee. One of the most common forms of drinking is the hoesik, which literally means dinner with co- workers.https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/parts-unknown-bourdain-korea- drinking/index.html Christopher Cha, CNN, 23rd March 2017 Many companies require their employees to join in frequent eating and drinking binges after work with bosses, although this trend has decreased in recent years, following backlash against excessive forced drinking, long hours, and sexual misconduct.https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/11/29/as-south-korea- tackles-drinking-culture-samsung-sets-guidelines/ As South Korea Tackles Drinking Culture, Samsung Sets Guidelines, Wall Street Journal, Jeyup S.

Located adjacent to the campus of Saint Louis University, it was built between 1964 and 1968 as a public housing development primarily for the elderly. The principal buildings of the complex are two high-rise apartment buildings, now called Grand View Tower Apartments and Council Tower Senior Apartments, and a former service station, later a fast food restaurant space also known as the SLU Del Taco. Before 2011 the restaurant building was a Del Taco restaurant The restaurant building, said to be reminiscent of a \\"flying saucer\\" spaceship, established a landmark presence on campus. The complex has been listed on the National Register of Historical Places since 2007.  History  Before Grand Center rose to become an entertainment district in St. Louis, the area was a residential neighborhood located just west of the original core of the city. In the years after World War II, civic leaders regarded decaying neighborhoods to be the city's biggest postwar problem. During this time in 1954, Mayor Raymond R. Tucker announced plans for the demolition of the Mill Creek Valley, which was destroyed in 1959 into what locals called the Hiroshima Flats. The area never attracted the investment that the mayor had thought and now Harris-Stowe and St. Louis University occupy the majority of the land. The Council Plaza housing development, built with financing and support from Teamsters Local 688 and its leader, Harold J. Gibbons, transformed the Grand Center area in the 1950s and 60s. The two apartment towers, the 16-story Council Tower West (now the Grand View Apartments) and the 27-story Council Tower East (now the Council Tower Senior Apartments) were two of the first developments built in the Mill Creek Valley. This area became known as Council Plaza. The Council Tower Senior Apartments building is still one of the tallest residential structures in the metropolitan area; in 2011 this building, then \\"largely vacant\\", was sold and the new owner began an extensive renovation, including renovation of the 260 foot high sculpture that covers the tower's east facade. The filling station building was built in 1967 based on a design by architect Richard Henmi. It was originally a Phillips 66 station, and later became a Del Taco restaurant. In 1967, the Phillips 66 was known for its bat-wing model, consisting of four tapered columns supporting a tapered round roof. The building developed the nickname ‚Äúflying saucer‚Äù based on its distinct shape. Proposed demolition Shown above is a timeline for the history of the SLU Del Taco building. As news broke out about the city knocking down the landmark restaurant space in 2011, SLU community members protested through social media sites like Facebook and Twitter; petitions were presented with thousands of signatures, and protesters crowded outside Grand Boulevard holding signs that said \\"SOS: Save our saucer\\" and \\"it came all the way from Neptune, show it some respect\\". Protesters eventually took their campaign to the city board of aldermen to help further their efforts to protect the historic building. Advocates for the saucer opened a court case titled ‚ÄúBoard Bill 118, the redevelopment of 212 S. Grand Boulevard.\\" This controversial issue divided the campus. While most of the students and alumni were against the demolition, SLU administrators like Father Lawrence Biondi, president of Saint Louis University, supported it. Biondi felt that the building drew too much attention and had caused too much crime and traffic problems. Ward 23 Alderman Joseph Vaccaro said he supported this bill, but would not support the Alderwoman bill, the bill opened to save The Saucer, because it has caused too many problems in the past. Eventually, the city announced that it would not knock down the building; instead, new tenants would be added, which later came to be Starbucks and Chipotle. This new project cost about $1.5 million.

During World War II, he was the senior American officer of Center Compound, Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp in Sagan, Germany. Early life and education Delmar Taft Spivey was born in Gatesville, North Carolina, on 9 August 1905. After graduating from high school at Whaleyville, Virginia, in 1922, he attended the College of William & Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia. Graduating from the U.S. Military Academy on 9 June 1928, he was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry and assigned as a platoon leader at Fort Benning, Georgia. Entering flying school in June 1929, he graduated a year later, transferred to the Air Corps and was assigned to Langley Field, Virginia. On 20 February 1930, Lt. Spivey, of the 52d School Squadron, experienced a forced landing when the motor of Atlantic DH-4M-2, 23‚Äì685, failed, the airframe suffering moderate damage when it came down 2 miles S of Brooks Field, San Antonio, Texas.

Evacuation and diplomatic intrigue On 27 January 1945, the prisoners of all three compounds of Stalag Luft III were hastily evacuated as the Russians advanced from the east and the camp complement and guards began a march in a blizzard to the garrison town of Spremberg, a sixty mile journey that took three days, and which was as hard on the guards as it was for the prisoners. There, Spivey and General Arthur W. Vanaman, the highest ranking American prisoner to be captured during the war, were separated from the POWs, the \\"kriegies\\" going by train to a large camp at Moosburg, in Eastern Bavaria, and the two officers taken to Berlin to meet with representatives of SS Lieutenant General Gottlob Berger, who was still in charge of Luftwaffe prison camps. \\"Working through the Swiss government, Berger made arrangements for Red Cross parcels supplies to be delivered from Geneva to Allied prisoners of war who were being moved from the Eastern Front. Like his earlier effort to prevent his own SS from taking over control of the Luft camps after the Great Escape, this was a calculated effort by Berger to appease the approaching Western Allies.Miller, Donald L., \\"Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany\\", Simon & Schuster, New York, London, Toronto, Sydney, 2006, Library of Congress card number 2006050461, , page 498. > After arranging for Red Cross food relief, Berger summoned Vanaman and > Spivey to his heavily guarded headquarters.

Hron is a late budding grapevine that ripens in the mid-late portions of the harvest season. The variety needs to be planted in deep, warm vineyard soils as it is very susceptible to winter frosts and cooler soils can delay its ripening. It has some resistance to the viticultural hazard of botrytis bunch rot but can be susceptible to fungal infections from powdery mildew. Wine regions Hron is currently found in the Malokarpatsk√° (blue) and Ju≈ænoslovensk√° (salmon pink) wine regions of southwest Slovakia.

Joshua Janavel, also written Giosu√® Gianavello (1617 - 5 March 1690) was an Italian condottiero and defender of the Waldensian Church. He was involved in the Piedmontese Easter of 1655, and in the Glorious Homecoming of 1689. Born in Ror√†, Janavel was a relatively prosperous farmer until his life took a sharp turn in 1655. In that year the Duke of Savoy launched a military operation against the Waldensian population with the intent of eradicating Protestantism from the region.Comune di Inverso Pinasca - storia Janavel led the defense of Ror√†, and succeeded in repelling the Savoyard assault. For the courage which he displayed at this battle, he became known as \\"the Lion of Rora\\" and \\"the captain of the valleys\\". However, the resistance did not endure for long. The Waldensians were defeated in the Valle Germanasca on 10 May, and Janavel was forced into exile, settling in Queyras.Fredo Valla, Uomini e donne delle valli olimpiche, in Piemonte Parchi - speciale Olimpiadi, Valli e Parchi, supplemento n. 1 di Piemonte Parchi n. 1, gennaio 2006, consultabile on line Notwithstanding threats against his family and a bounty of three hundred ducats on his head, Janavel soon returned to reorganize the Waldensian insurgents, together with Barthelemy Jahier. Janavel and Jahier led various actions leading up to 18 June 1655, when Savoyard forces attacked Angrogna. The Waldensians weathered the initial assault and managed to counterattack, but during the counterattack Janavel was gravely wounded, and had to be transported to Inverso Pinasca. Bowing to international pressure, Duke Charles Emmanuel II ended the campaign against the Waldensians and restored the status quo ante. Janavel continued to lead the underground Waldensian resistance. Over the following years he mounted a number of guerrilla attacks against Savoyard forces, and his house served as a base of operations and general quarters for the insurgency. The duchy punished him with banishment and a death sentence. On 6 July 1663 the Savoyards again attacked Angrogna, but were defeated. The Waldensian community desired an end to war, and agreed to the conditions of the Duke of Savoy, which stipulated the exile of Janavel and his soldiers. A Waldensian synod disavowed Janavel, and he was sent into exile in Switzerland. In Geneva he was welcomed as a Protestant hero, and maintained contacts with his native valley. Despite being under surveillance by the local authorities, as well as by Savoyard spies, he made at least two clandestine visits to his native country. In 1686, Janavel was joined by a fresh wave of Waldensian refugees fleeing the persecutions of Victor Amadeus II of Savoy. Together they began actively planning a mass return of Waldensians, which took the form of the Glorious Homecoming of 1689. By this time Janavel was too old to take part personally in the action, but he played a prominent role as an organizer; notably, he drafted the military orders governing the group's conduct during the operation. Janavel died of edema in Geneva on 5 March 1690. Janavel's house, known as la Gianavella, exists to this day. After passing through various owners, it was acquired by the Waldensian Evangelical Church and converted into a museum.Luoghi storici valdesi - Spazio museale della Gianavella (si vedano anche le singole pagine di approfondimento interne) Citations Category:1617 births Category:1690 deaths Category:Condottieri Category:Italian Waldensians Category:People from the Province of Turin Category:Deaths from edema Category:Italian expatriates in Switzerland Category:Italian expatriates in France ","title":"Joshua Janavel"},{"id":"39115177","text":"Manu v Steelink Contracting Services Ltd WEC2/98, often referred to as \\"Steelink\\", was an important employment case in New Zealand, where an employer tried to dismiss a worker through the back door on the basis that the employee was merely a casual employee, meaning that the employer did not have to go through the dismissal process to dismiss an employee. Background Mr Manu worked as a scaffolder in the oil and gas industry in Taranaki for Steelink, and at first in 1990, he was clearly hired as a casual employee, but in 1993 management informed him he was now a permanent employee. In September 1995, Steelink provided its employees with individual contracts to replace their collective agreement, which had the following contentious clause: While Manu objected to this clause, he nonetheless signed the agreement anyway. Other employees challenged the agreement and had the agreement changed. Not happy with what had happened, Manu raised his concerns with the union and also went on strike in support, resulting in the employer resorting back to collective agreements. Two months later on 13 November 2005 out of the blue, Steelink notified Manu that they were going to put him on indefinite leave. During the 2-day notice period, Manu did not unload a truck as he claimed he was unaware it had arrived. His employer's response was \\"Well, you can just fuck off now then‚Äîand I am not paying you for the rest of the day because you haven't done anything\\". Manu left work and never returned, and immediately lodged a person grievance for wrongful dismissal. Steelinks lawyers replied that he was not dismissed, and made the laughable claim that \\"further employment may be offered to him\\", which ultimately never happened. In February 2006, upon learning that Manu was now working for another firm, Steelink wrote to him saying they had outstanding monies owing to him, namely holiday pay, and asked how he would like to collect it. Not surprisingly, Steelink never offered Manu any more work, and many months later admitted it could have hired him at the Kapuni site, but claimed Manu had acted \\"threatening\\" towards a fellow employee, and that it would be a \\"health and safety\\" issue to employ him there. Manu ultimately claimed he was a permanent employee, that he was dismissed, as well as wrongfully dismissed at that. His main argument was that the casual clause was \\"harsh and oppressive\\", asking the court to set aside this clause. Steelink then applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for Manu's action to be struck out claiming it was without merit and was frivolous or vexatious. The Decision The Employment Court ruled that whilst the circumstances regarding Manu signing the individual agreement was not harsh or oppressive, it did rule that the casual clause should be set aside because it was harsh; namely it made him a casual employee, with no compensation for this inferior status. The Court also ruled that Manu was not dismissed in November 1995, but the decision in February to pay out his holiday pay was ruled as a dismissal, and awarded Manu $8,644 in damages. The court did not give any credence to Steelink's claim that Manu acted aggressively because the first they mentioned it was several months after it claimed it had happened. As a footnote, the judge pointed out that Steelink also had a redundancy clause, where they could have arguably instead made Manu redundant with only having to pay only one week's pay in redundancy.

Howley served as commandant of the American sector of Berlin after World War II, when the city was broken and in dire need of being restored. He became known as Howlin' Howley because of his interminable and intractable interactions with the Soviets.Daring Young Men: The Heroism and Triumph of The Berlin Airlift, Richard Reeves, 2010, page 76The Berlin Airlift: Breaking the Soviet Blockade, Michael Burgan, 2008, page 32 Early life He was born in Hampton, New Jersey, and was educated at the Parsons School of Fine and Applied Arts in New York City. Howley also attended classes in business and art at the Sorbonne in Paris, and graduated with a B.S. degree in economics from New York University (NYU).Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 19 and back cover At NYU he played football for the Violets at the positions of left end and placekicker. Although the team was then mediocre at best (1922-1924), Howley gained notoriety for his kicking expertise, and a nickname to match, Golden Toe. During his senior year, in a 41-3 loss to Rutgers, Howley's field goal accounted for their only score. He was also a baseball and track and field athlete.Bill Shannon Biographical Dictionary of New York Sports‚ÄîFrank Howley.

His first assignment was commanding officer of an Air Corps ground school, and he was promoted to captain. In 1941 Howley chose to pursue the cavalry and was made operations officer of the Cavalry School at Fort Riley, Kansas. Sometime later he was made executive officer of the Third Cavalry Mechanized at Camp Gordon, Georgia, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In the summer of 1943, whilst in Georgia, Howley suffered a motorcycle accident and broke his back and pelvis. He was hospitalized more than five months and was eventually forced to transfer from the cavalry. He was told he could go home or move to Military Government, or more precisely, to Civil Affairs. He chose the latter. Four Year Report, Office of Military Government U.S. Sector, Berlin, 01JUL45-01SEP49, page 5. Retrieved: 15APR13Berlin Command, Brig.

For the invasion Howley was designated commander of the Civil Affairs Detachment, with the \\"mystifying\\" code name of A1A1. In Normandy he landed on Omaha Beach on D plus 4 with a mixed American-British unit, along with French liaison officers. While the 9th Infantry Division worked to push the Germans out of Cherbourg, but with most of the street fighting over, Howley's A1A1 detachment exercised its mission authority. He augmented and reconstituted the local government, and got the city back on its feet. \\"The Cherbourg Civil Affairs operation was subsequently described by Allied observers as efficient beyond all expectations.\\"A Four Year Report, Office of Military Government U.S. Sector, Berlin, 01JUL45-01SEP49, page 5.

There he commanded a combined delegation of 150 officers and 200 enlisted men, and entered Paris along with the first troops. This job was much bigger than Cherbourg, and was to provide relief to the beleaguered French capital and its citizens. While in Paris, Howley was selected by Eisenhower's military government chief, Lieutenant General A.E. Grassett, to lead a military government detachment to Berlin. The British troops assigned to his unit received initial orders to return to England for their own preliminary preparations.Berlin Command, Brig.

Colonel Howley reached Berlin on July 1, 1945, after substantial haranguing by the Soviets. He had about 500 officers and men, and 120 vehicles as he began his expedition through the Soviet Zone. As soon as he arrived at the demarcation line he was told he was limited to 37-50-175, as per the Berlin Agreement. This stipulated, so they said, that he could pass with no more than 37 officers, 50 vehicles, and 175 men.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 30 There is no documented evidence of any such agreement. Howley \\"felt the hairs rising on the back of his neck,\\" as he experienced the first of his many personal disagreements with the Soviets. He ended up serving over four years as Military Governor in Berlin, first as deputy, and then as Commandant of the U.S. sector, and was relieved in 1949. The city of Berlin was in absolute shambles, having been devastated by thousands of tons of bombs by mostly British and American bombers. This was followed by brutal, close quarter combat in the streets. On top of that, the city was stripped by the Soviets of vital industrial infrastructure, especially in the western sectors.Berlin Command, Brig. General Frank Howley, 1950, page 44-45 The citizenry was starving, physically sick, mentally exhausted, and almost completely demoralized. To make any of this right was the herculean task that awaited the prospective U.S. military governor, and Howley brought to bear a broad background of leadership, experience, and pragmatism.A Four Year Report, Office of Military Government U.S. Sector, Berlin, 01JUL45-01SEP49, page 5.

Gavin, Ray W. Barker, Frank A. Keating, Cornelius E. Ryan (no relation to the renowned Irish journalist and author), and William Hesketh. But it was Howley's presence during these first two years that imbued stability in the U.S. sector despite the constant rotation of U.S. commander. The reasons for this were two-fold: first, Howley's expertise was in Military Government. His several superiors, however, were combat soldiers, who often lacked the experience and vision in dealing with civil affairs or in governing Berlin. And secondly, except for Keating, all of his predecessors averaged a stay of less than three and a half months in Berlin. General Lucius D. Clay promoted Howley to Commandant on December 1, 1947, and he succeeded Hesketh.Berlin Command, Brig.

Taylor, but only as Commandant. Military rule was out, and civil rule was in. Soviet Walkout from the Kommandatura On the night of June 16, 1948, the Soviet delegation unexpectedly withdrew from quadripartite meetings. The commandants and their respective staffs had been quibbling most of the day, having only reached one minor agreement. Towards midnight, Colonel Howley indicated he was tired, asked to be excused, and left his deputy to carry on. Even though Howley's actions complied with protocol completely, after briefly consulting with their ever present political commissar, the Soviets took offense at Howley's gesture. They declared that unless Howley returned and apologized for his \\"early\\" retreat, they would depart and not return. Indeed, they all arose and walked out. Unbeknownst to the western Allies at the time, the Soviets planned to instigate a blockade of western Berlin within days. Howley's departure that night had served them well. Some Kommandatura committees continued to function for several weeks with all four powers represented, even though the Soviet delegation did not attend all scheduled meetings. On August 1, 1948, the Soviet flag was lowered, they left for good, and the four-power Kommandatura ceased to exist. After that time the three western allied commandants continued to hold unofficial meetings at their own HQ offices. Instead of issuing Kommandatura orders, they basically issued unilateral orders, each man to his own sector, Howley included. However, these were issued in a manner of familial or neighborly cooperation.A Four Year Report, Office of Military Government U.S. Sector, Berlin, 01JUL45-01SEP49, page 26.

History Rond√≥n originated in Jamaica and was exported to Latin America by the Afro- Jamaican immigrant workers who migrated in the early 19th century to build projects such as the Panama Canal and the Costa Rican railroads. The dish is unique to the island, which its population, having left their homes in Africa, Europe, and Asia, were forced to use the limited amount of goods (for example, fish and coconut milk) that were wildly available. Although most Jamaicans are of mixed African descent, the dish is not consumed on the African mainland nor on any other continent. It is now, however, consumed by small minorities on the island of Tobago as well as areas of South and Central America which have Jamaican expats.

The name could also originate from the manner in which the fish is thoroughly cooked until it falls apart, or \\"runs down\\".Jamaica - Montego Bay, Port Antonio and Ocho Rios - John Bigley - Google Books p. (unlisted). Preparation A plate of Rond√≥n San Andr√©s Since rond√≥n is a traditional dish shared by different countries, the ingredients may vary from region to region. However, coconut milk is an essential ingredient in all the variants. With lobster, barracuda, and root vegetables In Nicaragua the meat used might be fish, beef, pork or even turtle meat‚Äîa common ingredient in Caribbean cuisine but also illegal in some countries‚Äîto which seasonings are added. It might include bell peppers, onion, bananas, cassava, elephant's ear and Argan. On the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, the ingredients include cassava, taro, yam, plantain and green bananas. The meat might be fish, lobsters or crabs and spices such as thyme, garlic, onions and yellow lantern chilli or \\"chile paname√±o\\", an important ingredient in Costa Rican cuisine. It can be served with flour dumplings. On the Colombian isle of San Andr√©s, the ingredients used are fish, snails, other seafood or pork. The vegetables include cassava, taro, plantain, potatoes and the spices used include basil, oregano, peppers, onion, garlic and poultry seasoning. In Panama, the seafood prepared with coconut milk can be served with rice, tostones or \\"patacones\\", and salad. In coastal areas of Colombia, \\"rundown\\" refers to conch stew. This dish may be prepared with conch meat, salt pork, root vegetables, breadfruit and plantains cooked in coconut milk..

It was originally based in Warrington, Lancashire, England. It moved to Darley Dale, a rural area near Matlock, Derbyshire, in 1904, as the Warrington area had changed from open countryside and become highly industrialised. The school was founded in 1844 but had roots back to 1697. The school abruptly closed in March 2005 following financial problems. History The school opened on 15 March 1844 in Warrington, dedicated to Saint Elphin who according to tradition founded the nearby parish church. In 1857 the objectives of the school were: to provide a good education on advantageous terms: (i) to orphan daughters of clergy from the Archdeaconries of Manchester, Liverpool and Chester; (iii) to the daughters of clergy still working in these Archdeaconries; (iii) to the daughters of clergy from any diocese. The original site in Warrington was in the country. However, by the turn of the 20th century the area had become industrialised, and the move to the countryside in Darley Dale was made. The building occupied had previously been the Darly Dale Hydro, a health spa. During the period up to 1944, various additional facilities were made to the school and the criteria for pupils were extended to daughters of lay members of the Church of England. In 2003, the school fell into financial difficulties and went into administration with debts of ¬£3 million. A proposal was put forward to develop part of the site for housing and thus raise income to save the school. This was rejected by the local council, and eventually the school closed in 2005.Matlock Mercury 29 January 2004: St Elphin's to close?, accessed 15 April 2013 In December 2010 a website was published about the school and is regularly updated with photographs, information, magazines and news items. Following closure of the school, the site was acquired in 2006 and developed into a luxury retirement village, the main building being converted into retirement flats. Following the dramatic closure of the school in March 2005 the owners attempted to sell as many of its assets ‚Äì both internally and externally ‚Äì and organised an auction to be held, on site, in April 2005. This included the Invicta Stone which was originally in situ at the top of a turret above the main front door to St Elphin's School (now St Elphin's House) in 1904. It remained in place until the 1960s when it may have been removed, together with the turret, for safety reasons and was left hiding in the rose gardens. The Invicta Stone was bought by a company in Oxfordshire dealing with architectural antiques. In 2011 a former pupil tracked the Stone down and negotiated a purchase price with the company. Audley St Elphin's Park agreed to have the Invicta Stone returned to its rightful home and kindly paid for the it. Old Elphinians (formerly St Elphin's Old Girls' Guild) paid for a suitable plaque to be made and a journey to Oxfordshire, back to St Elphin‚Äôs ensued to collect the Stone and return it to its rightful home. The Stone was professionally cleaned and on 6th October, 2012 there was an official unveiling of the Invicta Stone which is now situated on the terrace, at the top of the steps leading down to a croquet lawn. Full details of this amazing story can be found at www.stelphins.co.uk/invicta.html. Invicta means \\"undefeated\\"! The old girls and staff of St Elphin's School still maintain strong links with St Elphin's Park Retirement Village through a group set up by former pupil Liz Donlan (nee Bailey, 1967-1973) - The Old Elphinians (TOE). Liz formed the group in October 2012 and has arranged three major reunions at St Elphin's Park in 2012, 2015 and 2019. There was also a reunion in 2013 where old girls and staff met at St Elphin's Park for coffee and then moved to a local hall for the main event which was the unveiling of a beautiful St Elphin's School Memorial Quilt which had been made by two old girls in Australia (Ali Gracie and Jenny Gray). It was made out of pieces of original uniform, laundry bags, school bags etc and both Ali and Jenny took it from Australia to the UK for the unveiling by former needlework teacher, Mrs Barling. It is now hung on a wall at St Elphin's Park together with 5 scholarship boards listing girls who gained entrance to University. In the main entrance hall there is the original display cabinet which houses various trophies. Liz Donlan had permission from St Elphin's Park to use it for memorabilia items from school days - trophies, magazines, boaters, speech day programmes, ties and much more. In December 2011 Liz Donlan launched a website for the school - www.stelphins.co.uk - and this is being updated all the time as and when old girls are emptying their lofts and coming across photographs etc from their school days.

Yongsan Dreamhub (also known as the Yongsan International Business District) is a 28 ‚Äì 31 trillion-won ($22.6 ‚Äì $27 billion) project that was planned to be built on the banks of the Han River near Yongsan Station at the area of the Yongsan District, central Seoul, South Korea. Background The Yongsan District is a relatively large area of the megalopolis of Seoul that is seen as not significantly developed. It is a site of the American Yongsan Garrison which covers 16% of the district. The development proposal aimed to turn it into a modern sprawl of offices, malls, hotels and apartments, hoping to create a new signature district of Korea. History The project's main developers included the South Korean public transport company, Korail, which owns some underused land in Yongsan. In total, about 29 corporations, backed up the South Korean government, were involved in the project. Some of the plans for the development included that for a skyscraper that would be the tallest in Korea, and one of the tallest in the world (for example a 2009 design planned for a tall building known as Dream Tower, which would be the second highest in the world; another for a slightly lower if still the tallest in Korea and second tallest in the world, the Yongsan Landmark Tower, was described as in one report but only as about 500m in a different one). Another of the designs for twin tower skyscraper known as The Cloud unveiled and quickly scrapped in 2011 caused a controversy over a similarity to \\"the World Trade Center buildings exploding as they were hit by planes on 9/11\\". The project was first proposed in 2006, and was described as Korea‚Äôs largest and most ambitious property development project. Financing difficulties delayed it following the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The Korean real estate market also did not seem appealing to the investors. In subsequent years, a growing number of companies, such as Samsung, have pulled out of the project. The project has been finally cancelled in April 2013. It is possible the venture will result in a number of bankruptcies. There are also speculations about a possible class-action lawsuit by the residents against the developers and the government.

Newspaper  In January 2005 Daily Ireland, which was somewhat supportive of Sinn F√©in was launched. It contended (in line with its politics) to be an all-Ireland newspaper, however its sales were far stronger in Northern Ireland and Dublin than the rest of the island, and it closed in September 2006.  Television  A significant amount of terrestrial transmission overspill exists between transmissions from north and south of the Irish border, with a large portion of the population of Northern Ireland currently able to receive digital terrestrial television broadcasts from the Republic, and many in the Border Region of the Republic and beyond able to receive UK Freeview transmissions. Cross-border partnership On 1 February 2010 Ireland's Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan signed an agreement with the UK Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Ben Bradshaw. This agreement will enable viewers within Northern Ireland to watch RT√â One, RT√â Two and TG4 on a free-to-air basis as of 2012. The agreement between both jurisdictions will also guarantee that viewers within the Republic of Ireland will be able to view BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland on the Republic of Ireland's free-to-air service to debut in late 2010. A cross-border initiative has always been on the agenda for the Green Party in the Republic of Ireland. However it was later announced that a change has occurred such that BBC services are now to be offered in the Republic of Ireland on a 'paid for' basis and not the original free-to-air basis. Following a broad range of technical work, the two governments have now agreed an effective way to provide for the continuing provision of TG4 by building a new, low power TV multiplex in Northern Ireland. In addition to carrying TG4, this multiplex, which will be part of the UK DTT system, will also carry RT√â 1 and RT√â 2. This would be expected to increase coverage of these channels in Northern Ireland, to 90% of the population in Northern Ireland to receive their services on a free-to-air basis, either through overspill as before or via the new multiplex. The existing analogue signals will be switched off on a co-ordinated basis in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland at the end of 2012 and more work will to be done between then and now. Digital UK plans to keep Northern viewers abreast of compatible equipment in time for ASO switch to digital and know what sort of equipment viewers might need to receive these services. Foreseen as part of the agreement between both governments is the establishment of a joint venture between RT√â and TG4 to run the multiplex which will be licensed under the UK's Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 by Ofcom at the request of the UK Government. This will be a not-for-profit company. In addition, the licensee will have to put out to competitive tender all the elements of the multiplex operation which are contestable and the multiplex will be operated on a not-for-profit and open book basis.

He is best known for his appearances on the 24Kitchen television channel, where he hosts four programs: Rudolph's Bakery, De Makkelijke Maaltijd (Easy Meals), The Taste of Life Basics and The Taste of Life Travel.  Career  Van Veen has claimed that he already knew as a little boy that he wanted to be a cook. In 1985 he graduated from the Culinary School of Breda at the top of his class, and from that moment he was on his way to becoming a master chef. Since then he has worked in Switzerland, with Master Chef Cas Spijkers and obtained specialized training in pastry at Huize van Wely. In his 27th year, Rudolf won the title of SVH Master, which is the highest title that a cook in the Netherlands can achieve. National and international cooking competitions from his schooldays were a challenge for Rudolph to surpass. He has won first prize four times at the \\"Silver Toque\\" competitions in the Netherlands, and he has earned numerous medals as a member of Dutch cooking teams in Frankfurt, Sydney, London and Singapore. In 1999 he founded a Dutch Pastry Team together with four college patissiers, promoting the bakery products industry both nationally and internationally. Since 2000, Rudolph takes regular session on the jury of the biennial World Pastry Team Championships in the United States. He regularly participates and cooks on international food events all around the globe. His cooking shows have been popular on television for years. From 2000-2005 he had a weekly program called Life & Cooking, where he cooperated with Carlo Boszhard and Irene Moors.

In time through programs such as The Taste of Life and The Taste of Life Basics, Rudolph grew into one of the most famous television chefs in the Netherlands. During the period from 2009-2012 he returned to work with \\"Carlo & Irene\\" in a Sunday afternoon show called \\"Life4You\\". In May 2010 he took part in the first ever Dutch two-day exam for the title \\"Master Patissier\\", which he passed.

It is a collaboration between eight students from Fontys Academy for Creative Industries and guest lecturer Rudolph van Veen. For this project an old school bus was converted into a mobile bakery and tours the Netherlands selling creative cupcakes. The income is donated to several charitable purposes. After completion of the project, Bus Stop Bakery was awarded the \\"Best Student Company of the Netherlands 2011\\" award. On 24Kitchen, Rudolph hosts several programs. In De Makkelijke Maaltijd he shows viewers how to prepare easy meals with affordable and accessible recipes. In Rudolph's Bakery, Rudolph shares his knowledge and passion for baking, and joined by Dutch guests who share their favorite recipes. In The Taste of Life Basics Rudolph goes in search of the best products in the Netherlands, with which he then prepares healthy and quality recipes. Finally in program The Taste of Life Travel he travels the world in search of exceptional cuisines and local gastronomic secrets.  Personal life  Rudolph was born in Weelde, Belgium, and grew up in Tilburg, Netherlands. In 2012 Rudolph had a son, named Ralph, with his long-term partner Simone.

According to K.van der Laan he was the Leiden Beadle and called himself Piero.Pieter Cornelisz van der Morsch in the DBNL He was the jester of the Leiden rederijkers club De Witte Acoleyen and signed his works with his motto, which was \\"LX.N.Tyt\\" (spoken \\"el eks en Tyt\\", or \\"to each his time\\"). In 1598 he sent an invitation in rhyme to the other rederijker clubs to come perform at his wedding, and nine did. In the portrait of him painted by Hals, he is shown holding a smoked herring (the word for herring \\"bucken\\", or \\"bokking\\", has the double meaning of herring and red herring, referring to satiric comments). On the left, the text \\"Wie begeert?\\" means \\"Who wants some?\\". This phrase accompanied by the little monkey's head holding up his coat of arms in the upper right hand corner refer to his sharp wit and his epitaph, which he wrote himself.Frans Hals: Exhibition on the Occasion of the Centenary of the Municipal Museum at Haarlem, 1862-1962., pp 29-30, publication Frans Hals Museum, 1962 This epitaph was \\"Hier Leyt Piero/die deelde Bucken/En was Hier Bo/Van In te Rucken\\".

He played a prominent role in the establishment of hydropower in Sri Lanka and is known as the \\"Father of Hydropower\\" and was a member of the State Council of Ceylon.Wimalasurendra and Sri Lanka's hydro power Early life and education Born in 1874 in Galle, as the eldest son of master craftsman Mudaliyar Don Juan Wimalasurendra, He received his education at Ananda College, Colombo and joined the Ceylon Technical College in 1893, while working as an apprentice at the Government Factory. He graduated in Civil Engineering from the Ceylon Technical College and gain Associate Membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers (AMICE). In 1912, Wimalasurendra attended Faraday House in Stevenage, England specializing in electrical engineering and gaining the Faraday House Diploma in seven months, also gaining Associate Membership of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in Britain. Engineering career In 1896 he joined the Public Works Department as a field overseer, and was promoted to an Inspector within four years. Having become a Junior Assistant Engineer by 1900, he worked on building the concentration camp in Diyatalawa for Boer prisoners captured in the Second Boer War; in 1901 he conducted a survey on mineral deposits in the Kelani Valley. Having had his initial proposals on hydro power ignored by the Engineering Association of Ceylon he constructed the first small hydro power station in Ceylon, at Blackpool, between Nanu Oya and Nuwara Eliya, to supply electricity to the town of Nuwara Eliya. In 1918 he submitted a paper to the Engineering Association of Ceylon titled \\"Economics of Hydro Power Utilization in Ceylon\\"; in it he proposed the possibility of hydro power from Maskelioya and Kehelgamuoya, capable of lighting 100,000 lamps (114.5 MW). He also introduced the concept of developing a national grid. Only in 1923 did the colonial government undertake the development of hydro power in Ceylon, but Wimalasurendra was left out of the project and left the country on leave to England. He returned only on the request of the Colonial Secretary. In 1926 he was appointed Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department (PWD). Soon after he began the separation of the electrical section of the PWD. To this end under his direction the government took over the Colombo Electric Scheme (established in 1918) to supply power to the Colombo city and the tramways run by Bousteads Brothers Ltd. He became the Deputy Director of the newly formed Department of Government Electrical Undertakings (DGEU) in 1927, and established the first thermal power station in 1929, Stanley Power House. Having his projects undermined, he retired early from public service in 1929.  Role in hydropower generation  When engineer D. J. Wimalasurendra was sent to Aberdeen Laxapana falls by the British government in order to discover gold, he saw the possibility of hydropower generation. When the proposal of hydropower generation in Ceylon was presented to the British government, Wimalasurendra had to face strong rejections. But Wimalasurendra, who was further encouraged by the subjugation, continued researching on the subject aided by his own funds and eventually presented the research paper titled \\"Economics of Hydro Power Utilization in Ceylon\\" to the Engineering Association of Ceylon in 1918. National patriots and journalists joined D. J. Wimalasurendra and protested requesting the government to execute the hydropower generation project. As a result, in 1924, Laxapana Hydro Power Scheme was commenced, but shortly stopped due to weak government patronage. But D. J. Wimalasurendra, who was not discouraged, retired from service at the age of fifty and contested in the national election, to be elected to the State Council of Ceylon in 1931 in order to resume the stopped Laxapana Hydro Power Scheme. As a result, in 1950, Laxapana Hydro Power Scheme was successfully completed, paving way for many hydropower schemes that eventually made Ceylon, self-sufficient in electricity while strengthening the economy. Political career In 1931 he was elected to the State Council of Ceylon from Ratnapura, he held the seat for four and a half years and served in the Executive Committee of Works and Communication. He lobbied for the resumption of work on hydro power that was left uncompleted. As a result, the Laxapana Hydro Power Scheme, of which work had started in 1924 and stopped was resumed in 1938 and completed in 1950. In 1933 he proposed the formation of a Central Electricity Authority. In 1935, the State Council passed the \\"Electricity Board Establishment Ordinance No. 38 of 1935, however the Board was dissolved in 1937 and the DGEU re-established.  Legacy  Wimalasurendra is known as the \\"Father of Hydropower\\" in Sri Lanka. The Wimalasurendra Hydroelectric Power Plant in Nortan Bridge, Nuwara Eliya and the Wimalasurendra Power House at Laxapana were named in his memory. He died on 10 August 1953. In 1975, the Sri Lanka Post issued a stamp with his image.

This was a normal household item before iceboxes came into regular use, and it was an important part of the American household starting in the 1700s and continuing through the 1800s. The pie safe was used to store not only pies, but bread, meat, and other perishables as well, to protect them from insects and vermin. Origins The origin of the pie safe can be traced back to the early 1700s in America. It was likely introduced by German immigrants to the country, who typically settled in the Pennsylvania area. These people later become know as the ‚ÄòPennsylvania Dutch.‚Äô The pie safe was introduced to protect perishables and other ingredients from vermin and pests. Their popularity meant that most American homes during this period possessed a pie safe, or similar regional variation. Design A common pie safe is made of wood, is around the same size as a large bureau, and is approximately deep. The shelves within the storage area are often perforated. The safe normally has two hinged doors on the front. These doors, and usually the sides, are ordinarily ventilated either with tin plates with punched holes, or screens. The holes in the tin are often punched to produce an image such as a simple shape, or something more intricate like a church scene, eagles, and stars, or even a Masonic emblem. A notable design is the Wythe County pie safe, which has a distinctive tulip pattern. Pie safes that are freestanding are ordinarily made with long legs to keep them away from the floor. Some are wall-mounted or suspended from the ceiling. Most have a drawer, usually above the pie storage area, but sometimes below. Detail of a tin panel from a pie safe at the American Eagle Exhibit held at Taylor University A notable pie safe maker was the American industrialist and founder of PPG Industries (then known as the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company), Captain John Baptiste Ford, who made tin pie safes and sold them throughout the United States. Garde-Manger Variations In Cajun or Creole Louisiana, a pie safe is referred to as a garde-manger or a garde de manger. Pie safes from this region had doors with punched, tin panels, known in the region as t√¥les de panneaux, or were inlaid with baluster, closely spaced. These items of furniture were considered utilitarian, as opposed to decorative, and were often coloured dull red, referred to as gros rouge. Impact and Legacy The origin of the name of chess pie may have come from the term \\"pie chest\\", another name for a pie safe. Pie safes are considered to be collectable antiques and are commonly reproduced. They are popular pieces in the shabby chic interior design style.

He helped found the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in Calcutta which in its early days was involved in reaching out to lay citizens interested in science.  Biography  Pedler was the son of George Standbury, a pharmacist on Fleet Street, and Hannah Rideal. He was privately schooled and educated at the City of London School. With a Bell scholarship he studied at the laboratory of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain from 1866. He worked as a chemical assistant at the Royal Institution, working with Herbert McLeod, Edward Frankland, and Norman Lockyer. He worked with Lockyer examining the spectra from solar prominences in Sicily when the latter discovered helium on the earth in 1868. He also was involved in studies on chiral isomers of valeric acid with Frankland. In 1869 he visited America and on return he was a chemical examiner at the Department of Science and Art at the Royal College of Chemistry. He became a Fellow of the Chemical Society in 1870. After Herbert McLeod moved to the newly established Royal Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill, Pedler succeeded him. On the recommendation of Edward Frankland he was offered a chair of chemistry at the Presidency College in Calcutta. Pedler went to India aged 24 and became principal at the Presidency College, Calcutta in 1896 and also served as meteorological reporter to the Bengal Government in 1889. His major influence on Indian science was as professor of chemistry in Presidency College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta where his lectures in the FA course first attracted Prafulla Chandra Ray to study chemistry. Following his experience at the British Association he helped found the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science which reached out to laypersons interested in science. He also gave lectures at the Asiatic Society. Pedler was involved in chemical applications of value to India, he studied the toxins of cobra venom, corrosion of lead linings used in tea storage chests, analyzed water supplies in Calcutta and examined coal gas. He was principal of Presidency College four times from 1887, 1887‚Äì1889, again in 1889 and from 1896‚Äì1897. In 1901 he was Director of Public Instruction in Bengal, and was created a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in November 1901. He was knighted in 1906 shortly after retirement. He moved to London where he lived at Stanhope Gardens. Along with Lockyer he helped establish the British Science Guild in 1907 and served as its honorary secretary. Pedler married Elizabeth Margaret, daughter of C.K. Schmidt of Frankfurt in 1878. Elizabeth died in 1896 and in 1905 he married Mabel, daughter of William Warburton. He had no children from either marriage. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1892. He died suddenly while attending a Committee meeting at the Ministry of Munitions on 13 May 1918. The Alexander Pedler Lecture is given annually under the auspices of the British Association in memory of his name.
