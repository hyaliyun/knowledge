Ginsberg was the wife of the Polish psychologist Leopold Blaustein. She studied under the prominent Polish philosopher and logician Kazimierz Twardowski and was a member of the Lvov- Warsaw School.  Background  Ginsberg was one of the few women who studied under Twardowski and was part of the second generation of the Twardowski School along with Janina Hosassion-Lindenbaum, Izydora Dambska, and Maria Kokoszyńska-Lutmanowa, among others. In 1927, she finished her doctoral dissertation on the concepts of existential dependence and independence. She was also one of the women appointees when Twardowski established the Lvov- Warsaw School. Ginsberg and Blaustein were married on June 30, 1930. Due to their race as Polish Jews, Ginsberg, her husband, and son were killed by the Nazis at the Lvov ghetto.Drabarek, Anna; Woleński, Jan; Radzki, Mateusz M. (2019). Interdisciplinary Investigations into the Lvov-Warsaw School. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan. p. 38. .  Works  Ginsberg's dissertation, On the Concepts of Existential Dependence and Independence, was published in 1931 during the anniversary of the Polish Philosophical Society. Several years later, Barry Smith would include an English translation of this publication in a collection of works on logic and formal ontology called Parts and Moments: Studies in Logic and Formal Ontology. This is her only surviving work. Like her husband, Ginsberg also wrote several works in response to Edmund Husserl's theories. For instance, she sought to disprove the validity of some of Husserlian theories through her investigations on dependency. In the paper, Zur Husserlschen Lehre von den Ganzen und den Teilen (On Husserl's Theory of Wholes and Parts), Ginsberg discussed six of Husserl's theories. She offered proofs to theorems 1 and 3, validated theorem 5, but countered the three others. She also developed theories on descriptive psychology based on Husserlian thought. Ginsberg also participated in Roman Ingarden's attempt to establish a phenomenological circle at Lvov. This group's work mainly focused on aesthetics and descriptive psychology. Later, her ideas on existential dependence and other connected concepts have been applied by other theorists in the field of psychology.

He was most famous for his involvement in the crucial Battle of Fei River in 383, in which his ruse caused the devastating retreat of the Former Qin army. Prior to that, he was a subordinate of Huan Wen who after his death continued to serve Jin and for a short while under Former Qin. After Fei River, he returned to Jin where he would remain until his death in 392.  Prior the Battle of Fei River  Zhu Xu came from a family line general in Yiyang Commandary (義陽郡, around present-day Zaoyang, Hubei) and his father, Zhu Tao (朱燾) once served as Colonel of the Western Rong and Governor of Yizhou. Zhu Xu began his career in 365 amidst the rebellion of Sima Xun in Liangzhou. Jin's Grand Marshal Huan Wen entrusted him to lead troops to save Chengdu from falling. Zhu Xu quickly put down the rebellion the following year, and sent Sima Xun's head to Jiankang.(朱序攻司馬勳于成都，衆潰，執勳，斬之。) Book of Jin, Volume 8 In 369, Zhu Xu followed Huan Wen in his ill-fated northern expedition against Former Yan. Though ultimately a failure, Zhu Xu did distinguish himself by defeating Yan's general Fu Yan at Linzhu (林渚, around present-day Xinzheng, Henan) together with Deng Xia.(前鋒鄧遐、朱序敗燕將傅顏於林渚。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 102 Years ahead in 376, Zhu Xu would be called up by Huan Chong to defend Liangzhou from invading Qin forces but the defense was cancelled as the province swiftly fell before they could react.(桓沖聞秦攻涼州，遣兗州刺史朱序、江州刺史桓石秀與荊州督護桓羆遊軍沔、漢，為涼州聲援；又遣豫州刺史桓伊帥眾向壽陽，淮南太守劉波泛舟淮、泗，欲橈秦以救涼。聞涼州敗沒，皆罷兵。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 104 The following year, he would be appointed Inspector of Liangzhou and stationed at Xiangyang. In 378, Fu Jian would host a huge siege on Xiangyang. Zhu Xu initially did not worry as he noticed that Qin did not bring any boats. What alerted him, however, was when Qin's general Shi Yue swam across the Han river with his cavalries, catching him by surprise. Shi Yue would capture boats on Zhu Xu's side for Fu Jian and the others to use. As Qin forces approached, Zhu Xu's mother, Lady Han (韓氏), personally inspected the Xiangyang's defense and noticed that the northwest corner was weak. She led hundreds of women in the city to construct a new wall behind the old one. When Qin forces arrived, the old wall fell but the defenders mounted behind the one that the women built. The wall was dubbed \\"The Wives' Wall (夫人城)\\" and can still be seen today in Xiangyang.(序母韓氏聞秦兵將至，自登城履行，至西北隅，以為不固，帥百餘婢及城中女丁築邪城於其內。及秦兵至，西北隅果潰，眾移守新城，襄陽人謂之夫人城。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 104 Zhu Xu would hold out for a year, sending his soldiers out to fight skirmishes, but these proved ineffective as the Qin soldiers would simply back out to incite them away from the city, so Zhu Xu stopped doing so. Eventually, the Protector of Xiangyang, Li Bohu (李伯護) betrayed Zhu Xu and provided Qin an entrance. Zhu Xu was captured and sent to the capital. Fu Jian was impressed with Zhu Xu's loyalty and appointed him Logistical Director of the Masters of Writing. Meanwhile, Li Bohu was executed for his betrayal against Jin.(詔冠軍將軍南郡相劉波帥眾八千救襄陽，波畏秦，不敢進。朱序屢出戰，破秦兵，引退稍遠，序不設備。二月，襄陽督護李伯護密遣其子送款於秦，請為內應；長樂公丕命諸軍進攻之。戊午，克襄陽，執朱序，送長安。秦王堅以序能守節，拜度支尚書；以李伯護為不忠，斬之。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 104 Despite Fu Jian's flattery, Zhu Xu was determined to return to Jin. He fled to his hometown in Yiyang, where he hid in the home of his friend Xia Kui (夏揆). However, Fu Jian soon became suspicious of Xia Kui, so Zhu Xu decided to give himself up to Fu Hui (苻晖). Fu Jian admired Zhu Xu's actions, and further appointed him as Master of Writing.(序欲逃歸，潛至宜陽，藏夏揆家。堅疑揆，收之，序乃詣苻暉自首，堅嘉而不問，以為尚書。) Book of Jin, Volume 81  Battle of Fei River  In 383, Zhu Xu accompanied Fu Jian in one of his campaigns against Jin, which also happened to be his last. Fu Jian's army faced off Jin's led by Xie Xuan at Fei River. With an overwhelming number by his side, Fu Jian sent Zhu Xu to convince Jin to surrender. However, Zhu Xu instead leaked information about the Qin army to Xie Shi, pointing out the lack of unity among the soldiers. Zhu Xu then returned to Fu Jian, who had not know what Zhu had done.(遣尚書朱序來說謝石等以「強弱異勢，不如速降。」序私謂石等曰：「若秦百萬之眾盡至，誠難與為敵。今乘諸軍未集，宜速擊之；若敗其前鋒，則彼已奪氣，可遂破也。」) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 105 As the battle was about to begin, Xie Xuan persuaded Fu Jian to move his army slightly back away from the river to allow the Jin troops to cross. Fu Jian and his brother Fu Rong agreed and did so but just as they moved, Zhu Xu, who was serving in the rear, shouted, \\"The Qin army has been defeated!\\" Many of the Qin soldiers were conscripts, not willing to fight, and with Zhu Xu's words they began to panic and flee from the battlefield disorderly. Xie Xuan quickly crossed the river and attacked the Qin forces, decisively routing them. Fu Rong was killed and Fu Jian barely made it out alive but his northern empire would soon fall because of this defeat, leading to his eventual death in 385. As for Zhu Xu, he managed to escape back to Jin together with another Jin general Zhou Xiao and the abdicated ruler of Former Liang, Zhang Tianxi.(初，秦兵小卻，朱序在陳後呼曰：「秦兵敗矣！」眾遂大奔。序因與張天錫、徐元喜皆來奔。獲秦王堅所乘雲母車。復取壽陽，執其淮南太守郭褒。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 105  Final years  After his return to Jin, Zhu Xu was appointed Interior Minister of Langye. In 387, Zhu Xu was entrusted with Inspector of Qingzhou and Yanzhou and was stationed in Pengcheng to replace Xie Xuan, although he asked to be move to Huaiyin, so that he would be closer to the capital and away from Later Yan's borders. When the Dingling general Zhai Zhao attacked Chenliu and Yingchuan commanderies, Zhu Xu successfully drove him back.(翟遼遣其子釗寇陳、潁，朱序遣將軍秦膺擊走之。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 107 Zhu Xu's offices were replaced with Commander of military affairs in Sizhou, Yongzhou, Liangzhou, and Qinzhou, and as Inspector of Yongzhou as his old ones were given to Sima Tian (司馬恬) the following year. He also changed his station to Luoyang. In 390, the Western Yan Emperor, Murong Yong, invaded Luoyang, so Zhu Xu crossed the Yellow River and defeated him while giving chase. Meanwhile, Zhai Wei's Heavenly King, Zhai Liao took advantage of his absence and attacked Luoyang but Zhu Xu turned around and also repelled him.(西燕主永引兵向洛陽，朱序自河陰北濟河，擊敗之。序追至白水，會翟遼謀向洛陽，序乃引兵還，擊走之；留鷹揚將軍朱黨戍石門，使其子略督護洛陽，以參軍趙蕃佐之，身還襄陽。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 107 Zhu Xu retired of old age in 392 and his positions were given to Chi Hui (郗恢). He would pass away not long after his retirement.(雍州刺史朱序以老病求解職；詔以太子右衞率郗恢爲雍州刺史，代序鎭襄陽。恢，曇之子也。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 108  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.) (648).

North (November 19, 1840 – January 9, 1899) was an American librarian. North served as the Iowa State Librarian from 1871 to 1878, becoming one of the first women to hold a state office in the United States. She later worked as the first full-time librarian at the University of Iowa and was one of the cofounders of the Iowa Library Association. Life and library work Ada E. Miles was born on November 19, 1840 in Alexander, New York. She was the daughter of Milo N. Miles, a Congregational minister. She married George J. North, military secretary to Governor William M. Stone, in 1865; he died in 1870. To support her two children, North found a position doing temporary clerical work in the Iowa legislature, becoming one of the first women employed as a clerk in the State House. In 1871, State Librarian John C. Merrill died, and Governor Samuel Merrill appointed North as the new Librarian. This appointment made her the first woman to hold a state office in Iowa and one of the first in the United States. Recognizing that her work was being scrutinized because of her gender, North approached her work with enthusiasm. At her suggestion, a bill was prepared and passed that provided for a Board of Trustees to oversee the library, consisting of multiple state officials, and providing the appointed librarian a salary of $1,200 a year. As State Librarian North offered sessions on the use of the library's reference works and other resources. In 1872 she created the library's first printed catalog of its 14,500 volume collection. During her time in this role, she systematized and enlarged the collections of the State Library. In 1878 she became the city librarian for Des Moines. The following year, the Board of Regents of the State University of Iowa appointed North the librarian, making her the first full-time librarian at the university. She toured the Eastern United States, learning about new advances in librarianship, and implemented significant changes such as introducing a card catalog and reclassifying the 27,000 volumes of the library using the Dewey Decimal Classification. North encouraged greater student use by extending operating hours, opening the stacks to students, and instituting lending procedures. She held the position of university librarian for thirteen years, but in 1892 she was replaced by a political appointee, Joseph W. Rich. The editors of Library Journal protested her dismissal, saying she was very popular with students, although ill health may also have played a factor. Service to librarianship and legacy North was one of five library advocates to call a meeting in 1890 in Des Moines to create the Iowa Library Society; in 1896 the organization was renamed the Iowa Library Association. She was instrumental in promoting a training program for working librarians, suggesting that an organization \\"take up the work and start a training class in connection with its own library\\". She wrote an article for Library Journal in 1891 reporting on the efforts of Iowa librarians, urging: From the end of her work at the university in 1892 to her death, she suffered from ill health. North died on January 9, 1899 in Des Moines, Iowa.

History It was founded by the Crimean monk Malakia (hy) in 1381. Gathering students, he invited Hovhan Vorotnetsi (ru) and Grigor Tatevatsi to establish the Aprakunyats higher type school in the monastery, the first head scholar of which was Hovhan Vorotnetsi. The construction of the monastery was completed by Grigor Tatevatsi, who after the death of Hovhan Vorotnetsi in 1386 replaced him as the head scholar, and in 1391, due to the invasion of Timur, was forced to leave Yernjak. During 15th and 16th centuries St. Karapet Church of Aprakunis and its school was in decline, and in 17thcentury, the church and other buildings were already in a state of disrepair. In 1655, the monks Isaiah and Lazarus built a new church with a four-domed basilica with two- storeyed apses on either side of the tabernacle. The main part of St. Karapet Church was built of polished basalt, and the high, slender drum dome was made of brick. The decoration elements were multicoloured at the bottom of the walls. The name of the architect, David Usta, is mentioned in the inscription above the church tabernacle. In 1664-1666, a three-arched vestibule-hall (now a ruin) was attached to the western facade. Adjacent from the south was a vaulted, long St. Stephen chapel. According to the inscription, it was built in 1714 by Khoja Ayvaz, a merchant from Shorot. In 1705, Mr. Aghamal from Nakhichevan built a two-story bell tower on the roof of St. Stephen Chapel. Inside St. Karapet Church It was built in 1714 by Khoja Ayvaz, a merchant from Shorot.

Among the manuscripts written here, there are manuscripts of Grigor Narekatsi, Grigor Tgha and others from the collection copied by Hakob Grch in 1386. The monastery was a renowned place of pilgrimage for healing of snake bite. The relics of St. Karapet and St. Hovhan Voskeberan, the Thousand Saviour Cross, which were taken to affected areas during epidemics were kept in St. Karapet Church in Aprakunis.

Background World War I had started on July 28, 1914, when the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia. By 1916, nearly all of the European nations and empires had entered the war. The United States maintained its neutrality and some of its sizeable German population supported Imperial Germany and its Axis of Central Powers that was fighting the Entente Powers. In the 1910 census there were 2.3 million German-born immigrants living in the United States and 550 German newspapers in the country. The large number of German-Americans was also a factor in keeping America out of World War I until the fighting had been going on for three years. Early life Edmund Kayser was born in Bavaria. He moved to the United States and established an independent Lutheran Church that paid him $50 ($ in ) a month. It was said that he had other sources of income buying and selling land. Murder Kayser's St. James' Lutheran Church was based in Tolleston, a suburb of Gary, Indiana. His community had a number of German immigrants, some of whom supported Imperial Germany and its Axis of Central Powers, along with number of Slavic immigrants who favored Russia and its Entente Powers allies. During his sermons, he would often anger people by espousing pro-German views. Threats against his life had gotten so bad that members of his church had to escort him from the church to his home. Late one night, Kayser was confronted by several people in the study of his house. His wife and two daughters were visiting family in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Police say that broken furniture in the study showed that Kayser had put up a fight before he was subdued. He was bound by a cord, carried out, shot, and dumped in some bushes near his house. The gunshot wounds were to his chest and his jugular vein. Police were able to determine that no valuables or money had been taken from his house. His body was found an hour later by one August Schultz and his wife. Medical examiners later determined that he had bled out from his neck wound. The postmaster, Snyder, entered the case when it was revealed that a woman had sent him a threatening letter to stay away from a woman in Gary, Mrs. Mary Krause. Krause denied any type of relationship with Kayser. Chief of Police Heinz ordered police to interview the Gary woman. The letters had many threats such as \\"Move away or dynamite will move'\\" another read: \\"Before the leaves turn you will be stretched on the ground.\\" George Schneider, a member of the Gary Saxon Terien, was named as a suspect after he revealed that he had gotten in a fight the same night Kayser was killed, with bruises and scratches on his face.

She is the Associate Director of Population Sciences at Penn State University College of Medicine and a Full Professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Early life and education Growing up in New York, Schmitz was a dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Ensemble and a personal trainer and manager of the Salomon Brothers executive fitness center. While working at the fitness center, Schmitz realized she was often unable to answer clients questions due to a lack of knowledge. As a result, Schmitz decided to earn a master's degree in exercise science from Queens College, City University of New York and an MPH and doctorate in exercise physiology from the University of Minnesota. Career Upon receiving her PhD, Schmitz joined the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health faculty before accepting a position at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). She later recalled that she chose to switch institutions because of UPenn's \\"strong exercise physiology program.\\" While at the University of Minnesota, Schmitz conducted a small scale study on women with or without lymphedema and strength training. The results found that lymphedema symptoms go better in women who did strength training, as well as improved their strength, body fat percentage, and their quality of life. As an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Penn State University College of Medicine, Schmitz's research focused on understanding the connection between physical activity and diseases. In 2006, she launched a study on the effectiveness of YMCA memberships combined with supervised strength training classes on overweight and obese women. Her research began to gain more attraction when she published her randomized trial of weight lifting for breast cancer survivors. As an associate professor in the department of biostatistics and epidemiology, Schmitz established the SHE study (for Strong, Healthy and Empowered), to prove that resistance exercise significantly slowed middle-age weight gain. By June, she was appointed the lead author of the first American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable on Exercise for Cancer Survivors, which published guidance for exercise testing and prescription for cancer survivors. Formally, upper body exercises were discouraged for survivors, but Schmitz's research suggested that patients avoid inactivity both during and after cancer treatment. She later co-published a randomized trial study which was aimed at determining the benefits breast cancer survivors without lymphedema could enjoy through weightlifting. Her research team compared the results one year of weight lifting intervention could have on survivors at risk for breast cancer–related lymphedema. Her research was recognized by the National Lymphedema Network with the awarding of the Catalyst Award for \\"being a researcher whose work has stimulated thought, discussion, and debate that leads to improvement in patient care for those with lymphedema.\\" In 2011, the National Cancer Institute granted the Perelman School of Medicine a $10 million grant to establish a new center focusing on the relationship between exercise, weight loss, and improving the length and quality of life. Schmitz was appointed the leader of one trial in the center which focused on examining the relationship between lymphedema and weight loss in overweight breast cancer survivors. She later transferred her Transdisciplinary Research on Energetics and Cancer (TREC) Center grant to the Penn State Cancer Institute and became the associate director of population sciences. In 2017, Schmitz became the president-elect of the American College of Sports Medicine and was nominated for UPenn's Innovator of the Year Award. In her role as associate director, Schmitz co-developed updated guidelines and exercise recommendations for people living with cancer or survivors of the disease.

They share a common ancestor, Zhangsun Zhi (Prince Wenxuan of Shangdang in Northern Wei dynasty), 5 generations ago for Zhangsun Wuji and Empress Zhangsun, and 4 generations ago for Zhangsun Shunde. Zhangsun Shunde was born in a sinicized Xianbei clan. His grandfather Zhangsun Shiliang was the prefectural governor of Qinzhou in Northern Zhou dynasty, and his father Zhangsun Kai was a grand general and high-ranked official in Sui DynastyOld Book of Tang:长孙顺德，文德顺圣皇后之族叔也。祖澄，周秦州刺史。父恺，隋开府。. Zhangsun Shunde served as a lieutenant commander in the Right Guard during Emperor Yang of Sui's reign. In 612, Emperor Yang launched a massive campaign against Goguryeo and Zhangsun Shunde was drafted as a low-ranked commander. Zhangsun Shunde refused to go, and thus fled to Taiyuan and secretly became a subordinate to Li Yuan, who later rebelled against Sui in 617, and established Tang Dynasty in 618Old Book of Tang:顺德仕隋右勋卫，避辽东之役，逃匿于太原，深为高祖、太宗所亲委。.

The eighth named storm and third typhoon of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season, Bavi formed from a low pressure area depression on August 21 to the north of the Philippines and strengthened into a tropical storm on August 22. Bavi gradually strengthened as it skirted Taiwan and Okinawa, and became a typhoon on August 24. Passing over warm waters, Bavi turned to northwest and reached its peak intensity near Jeju Island on August 26. Thereafter, increasing wind shear and cooler waters caused Bavi to quickly weaken. Bavi made landfall in North Korea on August 27, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. Bavi caused minimal damage in portions of South Korea and Japan, but caused widespread structural damage and flooding in North Korea. Meteorological history On August 19, the JTWC began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated a couple hundred miles northeast of the Philippine archipelago. By the next day, the system rapidly organised, and the JTWC subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). On August 21, the area of low pressure became Tropical Depression 09W. At 15:00 UTC, the PAGASA named the system \\"Igme\\" and issued a severe weather bulletin for it. By the next day, Igme intensified into a tropical storm, according to the JMA and was given the name Bavi, subsequently prompting the JTWC to follow suit and upgrade 09W from a tropical depression to a tropical storm. Favorable conditions allowed Bavi to rapidly intensify, and by 12:00 UTC on August 22, the system became a severe tropical storm. As the system left the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA stopped issuing weather bulletins for the severe tropical storm. Bavi's period of rapid intensification was brief, and it began a slow intensification phase on August 23. On August 24, Bavi slowly intensified, and it was later upgraded by the JMA into a typhoon. Later on that day, it became a Category 2 typhoon. By the next day, Bavi intensified even more to become a major Category 3 typhoon. As Bavi moved closer to the Korean peninsula, one person died in Jeju island on August 25. Soon afterwards, as Bavi moved northwards it found very hostile conditions and high wind shear, that subsequently caused rapid weakening of the storm. Shear levels were high and the storm started an extratropical transition. Around 00:30 UTC on August 27, a weakened Bavi made landfall over North Pyongan Province, North Korea, as a minimal typhoon. Hours later both JMA and JTWC issued their final advisory on Bavi, as it became an extratropical cyclone over Northeastern China. Preparations=South Korea In South Korea, as a precaution over 470 flights were cancelled and railroad services were halted. Public parks were also closed for the typhoon. North Korea North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, held a high-level political conference where he voiced his concerns about Typhoon Bavi and the COVID-19 pandemic. China Several weather alerts were issued for portions of China as Typhoon Bavi neared. The Chinese Ministry of Emergency Management stated that 20,000 firefighters had been deployed equipped with 329 rescue boats. Impact and aftermath=Japan Bavi caused wind gusts of over 60 mph (96 km/h) on the island of Okinawa.https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/bavi-lashes-korean- peninsula-moves-into-china/799752 Large waves associated with Bavi were reported as far away as Kagoshima Prefecture. South Korea One person died in Jeju island on August 25\\\\. Heavy rainfall was also reported in the island with a maximum amount of being reported near Mount Halla. Despite a close pass to mainland South Korea, damage was minimal, consisting mostly of power outages, broken windows, and downed trees. Roughly 1,600 households in South Korea lost power. North Korea Infrared animation of Typhoon Bavi making landfall in North Korea In North Korea, snapped utility poles and trees were reported near Bavi's landfall location, as well as flooded roads. A peak precipitation amount of 224 mm (8.81 in) was reported in Anju. Several homes and public buildings were damaged in North and South Hwanghae provinces. In an unusual step, North Korea's state television network broadcast overnight as the typhoon impacted the country, interrupting programs every 30 minutes with updates on the storm's progress from the State Hydro-Meteorological Administration. It later broadcast images of storm damage, as well as field reports from correspondents in Pyongyang and Nampo.

She is known for introducing the autobiographical genre to the national literature of the Dominican Republic. Francasci was a feminist, and she faced significant criticism for writing prose at a time when women were expected to write poetry. She was also criticized for her work in erotic literature.  Early life  Amelia Francisca Marchena Sánchez was born in Santo Domingo in 1850, the daughter of Rafael de Marchena Pelaez, who was a Spanish-Dutch Jew of Sephardi background, and Justa Sánchez de la Parra, who was Dominican. She had four siblings, including Eugenio de Marchena and Emilia de Cohén. She chose the pen name Amelia Francasci based on an anagram of her second name.  Career  Francasci studied in the Dutch Antilles, where she was educated by Catholic monks at the Welgelegen boarding school in Curaçao. She spoke Spanish, Dutch, and French fluently, at a time when few women even knew how to write. Politically, Francasci was a liberal, a member of the Liberal Party of the Republic of the time. She belonged to the country's ruling class, and her skills, literary work, and position in public life marked her as a cultured woman. Though women at the time had little or no rights, and the constitution did not recognize them as subjects, she still was deeply politically informed. Francasci worked for many years as a writer for the Dominican publication Listín Diario. She published her first novel, Madre culpable, in 1892. She then produced a number of notable books in the early 1900s, including Francisca Martinoff in 1901, considered her most important novel, as well as Monseñor de Meriño íntimo, a sort of biography of Fernando Arturo de Meriño, in 1926. Her work is considered to be in the tradition of costumbrismo. Many of her books took on an innovative autobiographical and introspective tone, including Recuerdos e impresiones: historia de una novella. However, she faced criticism and rejection in the literary world for pushing the limits of what was expected of female writers at the time. Contemporary critics charged her with failing to write stories set in her native country, opting instead for distant locations such as Madrid. They also condemned the inclusion of erotic fantasies in her writing, transgressive for a female author at the time.  Personal life  After remaining stubbornly single until age 36, in 1886 she married Rafael María Leyba Amarante, who was 11 years her junior. He died in 1909, and while the couple left no officially known descendants, the possible existence of heirs to Amelia Francasci has been rumored in the past. Though much of her correspondence was lost in 1930 Dominican Republic hurricane, she left behind a great many love letters addressed to the French author Pierre Loti, though it is disputed whether her epistolary relationship with the faraway writer was a cover for another romance. After her husband's death, Francasci lived an almost completely isolated life.

History The line was the first one in the Bunbury area, officially opening as the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) Bunbury-Boyanup Railway on 12 March 1891. E.V.H. Keane had commenced construction in 1887 and the line was largely complete by late 1888, but financial difficulties delayed the opening for several years. Construction continued, with the official opening of the Byfield & Risely-constructed Boyanup-Donnybrook section on 16 November 1893. A few months prior, the South Western Railway opened between Pinjarra and Bunbury, absorbing the Bunbury- Picton section of the Boyanup line. A year later, on 21 November 1894, the first section of the Flinders Bay Branch opened between Boyanup and Busselton, coinciding with a reconfiguration of Boyanup Station to a transfer-friendly island platform arrangement. The Donnybrook-Bridgetown section of the line was constructed by W.N. Hedges and officially opened on 1 November 1898. Bridgetown remained the terminus for a number of years, however the first section of the Donnybrook to Katanning Branch, to Noggerup, was built by the Public Works Department and opened on March 26 1908. The Northcliffe line was next extended to Jardee (originally called Jarnadup), with the Public Works Department-built section opening on 14 June 1911. The State Saw Mills were created in 1913 by the Scaddan Government to support the State Government's desire to supply sleepers for the Trans-Australian Railway project. In order to service this sleeper supply contract, the State Saw Mills opened two mills south of Jardee, in Big Brook (now called Pemberton). The line from Jardee to Pemberton was constructed by the Public Works Department and opened as a State Saw Mills tramway on 20 January 1914. The Group Settlement Scheme greatly impacted the development of the region, with the first settlers arriving near Manjimup in 1921. After lobbying from settlers, the line from Jarnadup to Pemberton was upgraded with heavier rails and station buildings constructed, with ownership transferring to WAGR line on 11 October 1926. While pre-construction and surveys of the line to serve the settlers further south in Northcliffe commenced in 1924, significant works did not commence until 1929. The Public Works Department built the line at significant cost to navigate the terrain, making it the most expensive railway per mile in the state when it officially opened on 27 November 1933. The final train to Pemberton operated in December 1986, after which time the line was leased and used as a tramway by the Pemberton Tramway Company. Beyond Northcliffe When the line from Jardee was taken over by the WAGR and extended to Northcliffe it was considered as part of a longer line connecting to the Nornalup Branch to provide a southern route to Albany. The initial intent was to continue construction of the line beyond Northcliffe to Westcliffe, with surveys undertaken for this section. However, as the costs of the Northcliffe section soared, the decision was made to terminate the line there in 1933. While the WAGR never built the line to Westcliffe, the Kauri Timber Company did use 11km of the surveyed alignment for its timber tramway from Northcliffe. This included a notable long, high timber bridge over Palm Creek. Royal Train Derailment The Northcliffe Branch is notable for being the site of a Royal train derailment. During the then Prince of Wales' (Edward VIII) visit to the region in 1920 he travelled by special train, which derailed near Wilgarup while travelling from Manjimup to Bridgetown. Photos of the incident indicate that the His Royal Highness' carriage rolled, ending on its side. No significant injuries were noted. Alignment As operated by the WAGR, the line was from Picton to Northcliffe. Most of the line remains in place, although disused, with few changes since it was last operated.Arc Infrastructure Network Map Arc Infrastructure However, a section through Manjimup has been lifted as part of its Town Centre Revitalisation project, although the rail reserve remains theoretically available for future rail uses. Like all railways outside of Perth, the line is not electrified and is predominantly single-track, with passing loops at various locations. The section from Picton to Lambert is controlled by the Arc Infrastructure, with the remainder of the line to Northcliffe controlled by the Pemberton Tramway Company, under arrangement with the Public Transport Authority.Public Transport Authority Network Map Public Transport Authority Heading south from Picton, the line traverses predominantly agricultural land to Boyanup, where the South West Rail and Heritage Centre sits adjacent to the Shire of Capel's heritage-registered Boyanup Railway Precinct. From here, the line climbs through the Preston River Valley to Donnybrook and traverses a mix of agricultural and forested land south to Manjimup. Heading to Pemberton, the line passes the Diamond Tree and increasingly forested areas. The section from Pemberton to Northcliffe through dense karri forests and over several bridges is on the State Register of Heritage Places and considered the most scenic part of the line. Bridges The line crosses a few notable bridges, with the curved 127m long, 10m high Warren River Bridge being listed on the State Register of Heritage Places. Other notable bridges include: *Preston River Bridge at Boyanup *Balingup Brook Bridge at Balingup *Blackwood River Bridge at Bridgetown *Dombakup Bridge near Dombakup In particular, the section from Pemberton to Northcliffe features seven bridges, six of which are within 10km south of Pemberton. Of those, three are within a 500m stretch of the line. The final bridge, over Dombakup Brook is a completely wooden trestle bridge, of which no examples are known to be still in use. Branches While the Bunbury-Picton section of the South Western Railway was part of the original line to Boyanup, it is now considered part of the mainline, with the Northcliffe Branch connecting to it at Picton. The first junction en route is at Boyanup, where the Flinders Bay Branch diverges to the west, providing access to the Nannup Branch at Wonnerup. Further south at Donnybrook, the Donnybrook-Katanning Branch provided a connection to the east. =Timber Tramways= Several timber mills used to operate along the railway, each with their own access to the mainline. Many of these mills operated extensive timber tramways that fed significant quantities of timber to the railway. The section from Jardee to Pemberton was originally built as a State Saw Mills tramway, before being transferred to the WAGR 12 years later, in 1926. Operations=Passenger The only passenger services on the line are operated by the Pemberton Tramway Company. This tourist service is currently limited to the section between Pemberton and The Cascades, operated by diesel trams. Previously, the company operated passenger services along its entire section of the line, with steam-hauled trains Pemberton-Lyall and diesel trams Pemberton-Northcliffe. =Stations= With the line largely disused and the only passenger services operating from Pemberton, most railway stations have disappeared. However, several towns have preserved their stations, potentially re-purposing them for other uses: *Donnybrook *Greenbushes *Bridgetown *Manjimup *Pemberton Freight There are currently no freight services on the line, with only the first 3 kilometres in use as part of Picton Yard. However, it has been proposed that the line be rehabilitated and reopened between Picton and Greenbushes to carry lithium ore from the Talison Lithium mine near the town.Draft South West Supply Chain Strategy Department of Transportation It is hoped that the reopened line would support the carriage of other goods, such as mineral sands, agricultural produce and timber.

Contempt of court can be punished with imprisonment or a fine, or both.  History and legislation  The offence of contempt of courts was established in common law, and can also be traced to colonial legislation, with the earliest recorded penalties contained in the Regulating Act of 1773, which stated that the newly formed Mayor's Court of Calcutta would have the same powers as a court of the English King's Bench to punish persons for contempt. Courts established in India under colonial rule followed the common law principle that all 'courts of record' had the inherent power to punish for contempt. High Courts established in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras as courts of record subsequently exercised the power of contempt to penalise persons for interfering with the administration of justice. The Contempt of Courts Act 1926 was enacted to resolve a conflict of opinions between High Courts in India on whether they had the power to penalise offences of contempt committed against other, subordinate courts that fell under their jurisdiction. The 1926 Act specifically affirmed this power, and allowed the High Courts to penalise contempt against subordinate courts as well as against their own judgments and proceedings.In 1952, the Contempt of Courts Act was replaced by a new legislation of the same name, which expanded the power to punish for contempt from High Courts to other courts as well. The Constitution of India, enacted in 1950, specifically established the Supreme Court of India as well as High Courts in the states of India as courts of record with the power to punish for acts of contempt.Constitution of India 1950, articles 129, 215 Contempt of court is also a ground on which the right to freedom of speech in India can be restricted.Constitution of India (1950), art 19(2) In 1961, a committee headed by H.N. Sanyal, an Additional Solicitor General for the Government of India, was appointed to examine the application of contempt laws in India. The Sanyal Committee recommended that contempt proceedings should be initiated not by the courts themselves, but on the recommendation of a law officer of the government. These recommendations were incorporated in the Contempt of Courts Act 1971, enacted by the Parliament of India, which is the current legislation governing contempt of courts in India. The Contempt of Courts Act 1971 defines civil and criminal contempt, and lays down the powers and procedures by which courts can penalise contempt, as well as the penalties that can be given for the offence of contempt. The Act was amended in 2006, to limit the power of courts to punish for contempt, only when such contempt \\"interfered with the due course of justice,\\" and to allow truth as a defense to contempt.  Commission of contempt  The Contempt of Courts Act 1971 categorises the offence of contempt into civil and criminal contempt. The Act specifies that High Courts and the Supreme Court of India have the power to try and punish the offence of contempt, and High Courts have the power to punish acts of contempt against courts subordinate to them; however, the Supreme Court of India has clarified that any court of record has the inherent power to punish for contempt. In addition to these courts, certain administrative tribunals also have been given the power to punish for contempt, in their governing statutes.  Civil Contempt  Civil contempt, defined in Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act, is \\"wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court\\".  Criminal Contempt  Criminal contempt, defined in Section 2(c), is committed when anything is published, or done, which \\"scandalises, or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court\\", or \\"prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding,\\" or \\"interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.\\" The offence of criminal contempt has been held to cover false statements made to or about the judiciary, coercion and attempts to pervert judicial proceedings by attacking witnesses, parties, or judges, recording court proceedings without permission from the court, obstructing officers of the court from performing their functions, as well as verbal abuse and accusations of incompetence or bias against judges.  Procedure  The procedure for trying cases of contempt of court is provided in the Contempt of Courts Act 1971. Proceedings can be initiated by courts suo motu, i.e. by themselves, and require a notice in writing to be sent to person alleged to have committed contempt to appear before the court, when the contemptuous act or words occur in the presence of the court. Courts are required to conduct these hearings as soon as possible, and preferably on the same day when it concerns acts of contempt committed in their presence. Persons accused of contempt have the right to be heard in their defence and courts can hear evidence regarding the case as well. Detention in custody is permissible during a trial for contempt. When contemptuous acts or words are alleged to have occurred outside a courtroom, proceedings for contempt in the High Courts or Supreme Courts can only be carried out if with the permission of the relevant law officer. In the case of High Courts, the consent of the State's Advocate General is required, and in the case of the Supreme Court, the consent of either the Attorney General of India or the Solicitor General of India is required. Proceedings for contempt in the Supreme Court are also subject an additional set of regulations, known as the 'Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court'.  Defenses  The Contempt of Courts Act allows three defenses to charges of contempt. It allows an exemption for those who innocently publish or commit acts that would otherwise amount to contempt, if they reasonably believed that there were no ongoing judicial proceedings regarding these acts, or if they reasonably believe that the content of their words or actions did not contain anything contemptuous. The Act also specifically exempts fair and accurate reporting on judicial proceedings, and fair criticism of the judiciary. In 2006, the Contempt of Courts Act 1971 was amended to allow truth as a defense to contempt, provided that the person claiming this defence was acting in public interest.  Punishment and Sentencing  Both civil and criminal contempt share the same punishment under the Contempt of Courts Act 1971. The Act allows for a maximum term of imprisonment for six months, and this can be supplemented with a fine of up to . The Contempt of Courts Act 1971 also specifically allows courts to forgo the punishment if an apology is made to the court, and may use their discretion to determine whether the apology has been sufficient.  Criticism  In 1969, a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Contempt of Courts Act 1971 was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India, which found the law to be substantively valid. In 2020, lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan, along with journalist and politician Arun Shourie, and publisher N.Ram, filed a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Contempt of Courts Act again. Courts' powers to punish for criminal contempt have been repeatedly criticized by former judges and lawyers as having a chilling effect on freedom of speech, being too broad and vague in its definition and lending itself to misuse to shield the judiciary from criticism. Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde has argued that the offence of \\"scandalizing the court\\" is \\"incapable of precise definition,\\" and that it derives from English law, where it has since been abolished. In 2011, retired Supreme Court judge and former Press Council of India Chairman, Markandeya Katju, called for amendments to the Contempt of Courts Act 1971 in order to allow the media to report better on law and judiciary-related matters. In March 2018, the Law Commission of India was tasked by the Government of India with re-examining Section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act 1971, which defines the offence of contempt. The Commission was asked to examine a proposal that suggested that contempt of court should be limited to cases of civil contempt, i.e. disobedience of court orders, and should not include the offence of 'scandalising the court', i.e. criminal contempt. The Commission recommended the retention of the offence of 'criminal contempt' in India, noting that courts in India continue to use it widely, unlike other countries in which offences such as 'scandalising the court' have fallen into disuse. The Commission also noted that the power of courts to penalise contempt was inherent, and would continue to exist even if the Act was amended or deleted altogether.  Notable Cases  * In 1978, two newspaper editors from the Times of India and the Indian Express were charged with contempt following the publication of articles that contained criticisms of the Supreme Court's decision in ADM Jabalpur v Shivkant Shukla, a case in which the Supreme Court refused to protect the right to habeas corpus during the Emergency. The case was ultimately dropped after Chief Justice M.H. Beg, who had initiated the proceedings, was not supported by the two other judges on the bench in his opinion that contempt had been committed. * In 1981, V. K. Krishna Iyer, a former Supreme Court judge, delivered a public speech in which he criticised the functioning of the judiciary in India. The Kerala High Court tried him for criminal contempt after receiving a complaint from a person who heard the speech, but found him not guilty of the charges. * In 1997, Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray was convicted of contempt of court by the Bombay High Court, after he accused a judge of corruption in a public speech. The Supreme Court set aside his conviction on appeal, in 2004. * In 2010, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader, M. V. Jayarajan was convicted of contempt of court after he criticized a Kerala High Court decision banning meetings in certain public places. The Kerala High Court sentenced him to six months' imprisonment, which was reduced to four months on appeal to the Supreme Court. * In 2001, the Delhi High Court issued a notice to editor and journalist Madhu Trehan as well as four other people, in connection with an article published in the (now defunct) magazine, Wah India. The article in question had asked senior advocates in Delhi to anonymously rate Delhi High Court judges on various grounds, including their perceived honesty. The Delhi High Court found them to be guilty of contempt, but accepted an apology and did not penalise the offence. * In 2002, writer Arundhati Roy was arrested and charged with contempt of court by the Supreme Court of India, after she wrote an article criticising one of the court's judgments concerning the Narmada Dam, and participated in a protest regarding this outside the Court. Following her arrest, Roy made a further statement questioning the Supreme Court's initiation of contempt proceedings against her, and turned down the Court's offer to allow her to escape punishment with an apology. She was imprisoned for one day and fined . In 2016, Roy faced contempt of court proceedings again after she criticised the arrest of Delhi University professor G.N. Saibaba, who was jailed for alleged links to Maoists in India. * In 2003, the Karnataka High Court initiated contempt proceedings against 56 persons, including publishers, editors, and journalists, from 14 publications. These publications had carried reports about an alleged sex scandal in Mysore, in which several High Court judges had been implicated. An investigation cleared the judges of wrongdoing, and the contempt proceedings were eventually stayed. * In 2011, BM Patel was convicted of contempt of court by the Gujarat High Court and sentenced to imprisonment for three months as well as a fine of 2000. Patel was convicted in relation to comments he made on the judiciary in connection with an ongoing litigation concerning property. The Gujarat High Court stated that this was only the second time that a conviction had been secured under the Contempt of Courts Act 1971. * In 2013, Bollywood actor Rajpal Yadav and his wife, Radha Yadav, were both convicted of contempt of court and jailed for ten days, after failing to appear before the Delhi High Court during a suit against them for recovery of debts. * In 2015, Madras High Court judge, C. S. Karnan, wrote to the Supreme Court, indicating that he would initiate contempt of court proceedings against the then-Chief Justice of India, H. L. Dattu, in the context of an ongoing dispute about the treatment of Dalit judges in the judiciary. The Supreme Court in turn, initiated contempt of court proceedings against Justice Karnan, sentencing him to six months' imprisonment. Justice Karnan initially refused to accept the warrant for his arrest but was later arrested and served the period of imprisonment. * In 2020, lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan was convicted of contempt of court. He had posted a press photograph of the current Chief Justice of India, Sharad Bobde, seated on a motorcycle without a face mask during the Covid-19 pandemic in India, and criticized the judiciary for their selective focus in hearing cases during the lockdown. He declined an offer from the Supreme Court to apologise for these comments. A challenge to the constitutionality of the Contempt of Courts Act, filed by Bhushan and others, is still pending.

The park is located within the city's larger Whetstone Park in the Clintonville neighborhood. Attributes The Columbus Park of Roses is a park and garden, one of the largest public rose gardens in the country. The park has about 11,000 rose specimens and 350 varieties. The park is located within the Whetstone Park; both are operated by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department. The park is open to the public for free, from 7 a.m. to dusk year-round. In addition to the floral displays and gardens, the park includes picnic spaces, a shelterhouse that is reservable for parties and weddings, a walking trail, and forests. The park has a small outdoor theater and gazebo. The gazebo was built in 1878 at the Fort Hayes military reservation, and was restored and reinstalled in the Park of Roses in 1975. The Civitan Club of North Columbus hosts annual concerts throughout summer here, and was one of several organizations to procure and restore the gazebo. Many of the park's features have been donated, including its sundial (in 1954), a plaque with a poem inscribed, park benches, and rose bushes. Gardens Garden areas include: *The Formal Rose Garden — symmetrical rose beds, each planted with a single variety *The Heritage Rose Garden — pre-1867 rose cultivars, many of which are predecessors of modern roses *The Perennial Garden — about 100 varieties of perennials, bulbs, shrubs, and trees *The Herb Garden — about 100 plant varieties grouped by use, fragrance, or pollinator qualities *The Backyard Garden — low-maintenance plants and trees intended to give visitors ideas for home gardens *The Arboretum — spread throughout the park, with approximately 138 tree and shrub varieties =Rose gardens= View of the Formal Rose Garden, 1992 The Formal Rose Garden was the first area planted, in 1953. It was designed as a formal Italian garden, with symmetrical hedges. Each rose bed is planted with a single variety, and no other flowers, trees, or shrubs. The garden covers 7 of the park's 13 acres, and has about 11,000 varieties: floribunda, grandiflora, hybrid tea, climber and shrub roses. The garden's eastern end features a decorative observation tower, added to the garden in the 1980s. Its center features a fountain, installed in 1957 and renovated in 2012. The garden's western stone and iron fence entrance was completed in 2017. The Heritage Rose Garden features roses cultivated before 1867, the date accepted for the beginning of modern roses. The garden was dedicated in 1986. Roses include centifolias, damasks, gallicas, and rugosas. =Other plantings= The Perennial Garden, south of the Formal Rose Garden, has eight large beds and about 100 varieties of perennial plants, bulbs, trees, and shrubs. Its plantings change throughout the year, given Ohio's long growing season from March to November. The garden was part of the park's original landscape plan, but was only completed in the early 1970s. The Northview Buckeye Garden Club has planned and maintained it since 1997. The Herb Garden, just east of the Perennial Garden, has about 100 herbs and functional plants. There are nine thematic beds - culinary, tea, medicinal, dye, edible flowers, fragrance, rose, pollinator, and Native American. The Herb Garden was created in 1976, after severe winters damaged many of the roses originally planted here. The Columbus Horticultural Society has planned and maintained the garden since its opening. The Backyard Garden, in the northwest corner of the park, has a wide variety of bulbs, perennials, shrubs, and ornamental trees, intended to give guests ideas for their own gardens. The garden was developed from 2007 to 2009, and is the first public Earth-Kind Garden outside the American South. It was originally planned to test commercially-available roses without the use of fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, or other special maintenance, though other plantings have been added, with conservation and ease of care in mind. The Arboretum is an extensive collection of trees, one of the park's year- round features. It has approximately 138 tree and shrub varieties. The Arboretum provides a natural habitat for native birds of Ohio, migratory birds, pollinators, and insects. History Early plan for the garden, 1952 Around 1946, ideas came up for a rose garden at Columbus City Hall. The idea never became a reality, but the movement toward a rose park began. In 1951 members of the Columbus Rose Club and the Central Ohio Rose Society formed a committee to create the park, which was established April 19, 1952. At this time, the Columbus Rose Commission, a committee of eleven members, began advising the parks department regarding the Park of Roses. In May, the city park and forestry department began designing it, led by Ray S. Dietz, Eugene A. Rosebrook, and George B. Tobey, Jr. 2,000 hybrid teas were planted in autumn 1952, though most planting was in late March to April 1953. The park opened to the public on June 6, 1953, following all the paths and gardens laid out, and enclosed by a fence. At this time, the garden had 20,000 plants. The park's official dedication was on September 13 of that year. At the time, the surrounding Whetstone Park was the largest in Columbus, with 100 acres. The Park of Roses utilized 13.5 acres, though with 35 total acres including woodlands and a natural ravine. By 1956, the park had 32,000 plants and 425 varieties. At this time, it had a flowering crab apple collection, with proposed lilac and children's gardens to be installed. The headquarters of the American Rose Society was located in the park, which included the largest rose library in the world. The Park of Roses Foundation was created in February 1986 to manage donations to the park, after harsh winters in the mid-1970s killed almost half its bushes.Leach, Michael. \\"Park of Roses blooms, thrives with help of foundation.\\" Columbus Dispatch. 13 June 2004, p. 1I.

History The Dumaguete Mission Hospital (or Silliman University Mission Hospital) which was established as early as 1901 as a small infirmary, is the forerunner of the present-day Silliman University Medical Center. It was not until later in 1903 that a hospital was formally built in replace of it, by the American missionary doctor, Henry Langheim together with his wife who was also a medical practitioner as founders. The Langheims were the pioneers of Missionary Medical Work in Negros Oriental during when the Philippines was opened to Protestant missions. Henry Langheim and his wife took care of the general day to day operations in the hospital. On February 26, 1916, Katipunan Hall on the main campus of Silliman University was inaugurated as the home of Dumaguete Mission Hospital. During the onset of World War II, it resulted for some of the hospital's facilities and operations being minimized. In 1942, the Dumaguete Mission Hospital staff agreed to divide their forces, so as to continue to serve both the people who remained in Dumaguete and those who had fled to the hills. Dr Roman Ponce de Leon remained at the hospital in Dumaguete, while Dr. Jose Garcia established an evacuation hospital at Pamplona, Negros Oriental. As Japanese activity stepped up, the evacuation hospital had to close, and Dr Garcia joined the resistance in the interior mountains of Negros island where American missionaries and their families, SU faculty staff, and students operated throughout the duration of the war. After the Philippines was liberated in 1946 the hospital was re-opened. Since its founding in 1903, Henry Langheim did not only dedicated his service to the mission hospital but to the whole province of Negros Oriental as well. He taught at Silliman University and served as the institution's member of the Board of Trustees. In 1947, the Board approved the plan for the hospital to become part of a medical union with the insistence that it retain its name and institutional identity. Thus it became part of a bigger organization under a Hospital Advisory Committee and continued to serve and operate under the watchful eyes of medical professionals until it earned recognition for their concern and regard toward the health and medical conditions of the general public. In the years that passed by, it was replaced by Silliman University Medical Center. In 1974, a cornerstone for the present hospital's location on Aldecoa Drive, was laid down to commence the building of a four-storey modern healthcare facility with passenger elevators, the first in Negros Oriental. SU Medical Center made a milestone in 1979 when its Van Houweling Research Laboratory discovered and produced a dog vaccine that gave a three-year immunity from rabies. The said development was later used by some countries on their fight against rabies, in collaboration with the World Health Organization. In the early 2000s, saw the need for the hospital's expansion to server the surrounding community, thus resulting for its management to upgrade its facilities with the addition of newly built structures - the SU Medical Center Specialty Building (4 storey) and the SU Medical Center Medical Arts Building (also a 4 storey structure).\\"SU 107th Founder's Day (Year 2008)\\" .

He has authored or co-authored 8 books along with various monographs and chapters and has published over a hundred research papers. He has coedited 6 books providing reports of contemporary research in a particular area of science education. His principle research areas include teaching, curriculum, assessment, teacher development (preservice and inservice teacher education), science, physics and engineering. Gunstone is a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and a Life Member of the Science Teachers' Association of Victoria. In 2014 he was presented with the Distinguished Contributions to Science Education through Research Award of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching in USA. He developed and edited the first encyclopedia of science education research and development which was published in 2015. This encyclopedia is a reference work with contributions from 353 different authors from 36 different countries.  Education  Gunstone completed his Bachelors in Physics and Geophysics from University of Melbourne in 1963. He received his Trained Secondary Teachers Certificate in 1960 from the Secondary Teachers College. In 1973, Gunstone completed his post graduate studies in science education and measurement from Monash University. Later in 1980, he received his doctorate degree from the same institution.  Career  Gunstone joined Faculty of Education at Monash University as a tutor of science teaching and physics teaching in 1971 and then as a lecturer in 1972. He climbed through the ranks at the university as an associate professor from 1988 till 1995. He was a Professor of Science and Technology Education from 1995 till 2005. He founded and directed the International Centre for the Study of Science and Mathematics Curriculum at Monash-Kings College from 2002 till 2005. At Monash University, he has held several administrative positions. He served as associate dean of research for 2 consecutive terms from 1996 till 2002; associate dean from 2003 till 2004 and completed two tenures as acting dean between 1999 and 2009. In 2006, he became an emeritus professor at Monash University and remains active in collaborative research and writing and mentoring. From 2016 till 2018, Gunstone served as Extraordinary (honorary) Professor at North-West University. He has served as a visiting scholar and external assessor at various universities in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania.  Research and work  Gunstone's key research areas include constructivist framework studies in teaching, learning and teaching development with special focus on preservice and inservice, curriculum assessment, science education; particularly in physics and engineering. Curriculum  In January 1975, Gunstone published an article about the role of teachers in curriculum decisions. He discusses the science curriculum decisions in schools in Victoria and the effects of school curriculum autonomy present at that time in Victoria in Grades 7 to 10. His research explores the extent and the type of the curriculum decision making the teachers do in schools that have no eternally prescribed courses. Evidence of weak decision making was recorded however, the teachers were found to be more involved in the decision making. In 2007, Gunstone authored an article titled Science Curriculum in the Market Liberal Society of the Twenty-first Century: 'Re- visioning' the Idea of Science for All, and discusses the three international movements in scientific education and their influence on the science curriculum. He researched about the gradual change in the policy responses to the proposition of teaching science to all school students and presented arguments for a 'Science for All' curriculum. Physics education  Gunstone's research on Physics education began in the late 1970s. He researched in 1978 about the role of language and discussion in the learning of physics along with the present concerns about the role and comprehension of language in science, and related it to the learning and the concepts of physics in secondary schools. With colleagues he has proposed learning and teaching strategies for the study of physics, including 'Predict-Observe- Explain' that is now widely used in teaching and research. In 1981, in the article about the impact of physics instruction on the cognitive structure and performance, Gunstone used a modified word-association technique and Venn diagrams to show that different teaching approaches resulted in different structures of ideas in memory and performance differences for conceptual problems and applying the learned knowledge to new situations. In his publication about the perception of students regarding the learning and teaching experience of first year university physics, Gunstone studies the transition in the study of physics from school to university. This research focuses on physics students' perceptions about the content and the teaching methodology of physics in the first year of university. Teaching and teacher education  Teaching methodology and procedures have been a central research area of Gunstone since the late 1980s. In an article in 1999 about effective teaching methods to improve students' understanding of physics, Gunstone explains the method and applications of a technique called Conceptual Understanding Procedure (CUP) for facilitating a student’s comprehension of difficult physics concepts. Gunstone's research about the impact of self-study in teaching and research in 1996 used a longitudinal school based professional development program designed for science teachers to study about the various perspectives about self-study in teaching and research. He discussed self- study as being personal and collaborative as compared to being related with teaching and research. Research about the views of physics teachers regarding learning and various approaches to teaching physics was conducted in 2012 by Gunstone to address the decline of student interest about physics and science related subjects. This research adds further to the prior work on classification of teachers based on the traditional and the conceptual change teaching approaches used. The study concluded that that the views of teachers who promoted conceptual change were constructivist while the teachers that supported the traditional, transmission method of teaching were of the absorptionist views. Again working with colleagues he has developed research- based structures for and approaches to the pre-service education and in- service education of science teachers that have had impact in many countries. Gunstone was awarded the 'Distinguished Contributions to Research' award for his research about science learning and teaching and teacher education.

The temple is roofless in the center and it houses a triangular- shaped stone idol of Bhimsen. The idol is believed to resemble three deities: Bhimeshwar in the morning, Mahadeva throughout the day, and Narayana in the evening. The temple attracts around 5,000 worshippers every week. The temple is believed to signal any bad fortune before it takes place. Mythology The temple is devoted to Bhimsen, the second brother among the Pandavas depicted in the Hindu mythology of Mahabharata. It is believed that Pandavas spent their twelve years of exile in Dolakha. According to local legend, twelve porters made a three-stoned stove to cook their rice near a temple. When they noticed that only one side of the rice was cooked, they flipped the rice over. As the cooked rice came in contact with the triangular-shaped black stone, it turned raw. One of the porters got angry and hit the stone with his ladle. The stone cracked and bled blood-coated milk. The porters realized that the stone was Bhimsen's. History The exact date of establishment is unknown. An inscription dated 1611 AD mentions the renovation of the temple. Sweating of idol The Bhimsen's statue perspires in the form of fluid-like drops from time to time. The perspiration is considered a bad omen for the country. It is believed that Bhimsen himself tries to protect his people by warning them through sweating. Historically, when such an event occurred, the priest soaked the sweat in cotton and sent the cotton to the royal palace. In return, the king would send two goats and a sum of money to clear away the misfortune. This custom has been discontinued after significant political changes within Nepal. Some of the sweating events include: * During the change of the Rana regime, in 2007 BS, the idol is believed to have sweated. * The idol sweat in 1934 before a devastating earthquake that killed 8,500 people. * It was reported that the idol sweated a few days ahead of royal massacre that killed King Birendra and his family.

The play was based on Thompson's play of the same name and stars Wendy Crewson, Barbara Williams, Alison Pill, and Rachel McAdams. The film concerns the friendship of childhood best friends Patsy Willets and Marie Beck who reunite after a separation of 30 years. The film premiered at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. Summary Famed opera singer Francesca Prine, born Marie Beck, (Barbara Williams) receives an invitation to return to her hometown of Marmora, Ontario and sing in a charity concert from her former best friend Patsy Willets (Wendy Crewson). The two friends have not seen each other in thirty years after a train accident injured them both. In flashbacks we see Marie and Patsy's friendship evolve. As a child Marie is bullied but is nevertheless befriended by Patsy who frequently invites her to her home. Patsy notices that Marie is poor and is neglected by her alcoholic, abusive mother. Patsy and her mother do their best to offer help to Marie and teach her to play the piano and sing, which Marie takes to naturally. As the girls turn to teens the bullying grows worse and Marie is sexually harassed by local boys. Marie asks Patsy for help identifying the reason behind the bullying and is dismayed when Patsy points out her poor hygiene. Marie develops a crush on Don Rayford, a pianist she meets at church who immediately recognizes her enormous talent as the two prepare for the local Kiwanis Music Festival. Encouraged by Patsy, Marie asks Don to a Sadie Hawkins dance and he accepts. The night of the dance Patsy helps Marie prepare though she is unable to attend herself as she is sick. Marie's mother calls the house in a drunken rage to tell Marie not to be a slut which Marie mocks as she has never even kissed a boy. Things with Don go well at the dance until he drunkenly leaves Marie. Confused Marie leaves the dance and is gang raped by several of her bullies. She makes her way to Patsy who attempts to call for help but is unable to because the phone is a partyline. Marie then attempts suicide by going to the train tracks. Patsy initially tries to save her before being hypnotized by the light of the oncoming train; she is ultimately saved by Marie who manages to pull her away, though not before she is somewhat injured by the train. In the present Francesca and Patsy struggle to reconnect as Patsy is in awe of Francesca's celebrity and wild lifestyle whereas Francesca seems to look down at her small life as a housewife. The other townspeople also treat Francesca like a celebrity, despite the fact that they bullied her as a child. Both Francesca and Patsy bear scars from their childhood; Francesca is prone to panic attacks and Patsy has developed seizures from her injuries from the train. In order to reconcile themselves the two friends go back to the train tracks where they remember the night of the accident. Each woman reveals that they credit the other with having saved their life.

Early life  Carmen Natalia Martínez Bonilla was born in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic, in 1917. Her parents were Andrés Martínez Aybar and Carmen Julia Bonilla Atiles, and she was one of seven children. In 1931, her family moved to Santo Domingo, where she worked for a time in a relative's factory to help support her mother. As a child, she studied at the Salomé Ureña School. Carmen Natalia was an autodidact, having been refused admission to the Universidad de Santo Domingo, where she had hoped to study philosophy and literature, because of her political beliefs. She had signed a letter condemning the firing of her uncle, José Antonio Bonilla Atiles, a professor at the university. Instead, in 1937 she obtained a job as advertising manager for the movie distribution company Circuito Rialto, working to promote radio programs, theater performances, and films.  Literary debut  In 1939, at just 22 years old, she published her first book of poetry, Alma Adentro. She began writing frequently under the pen name Carmen Natalia for such varied literary journals as Los Nuevos and La Poesía Sorprendida, also contributing to the newspapers La Opinión and Listín Diario. In 1942, her first novel, La Victoria, was honored as the best Dominican novel at the Farrar & Rinehart International Competition in Washington. It openly questioned the social order under the Trujillo regime.  Political activity  Carmen Natalia was considered one of the driving forces behind the anti-Trujillo youth organization Juventud Democrática Dominicana in the 1940s. In 1946, her brother Andrés was expelled from the Colegio La Salle for being a member of the organization, and she wrote an angry letter to the school's director in response. Her involvement in the underground Vanguardia Revolucionaria movement got her fired from her job at Circuito Rialto, and she was banned from continuing to write for La Opinión. All of her family members also lost their jobs, including her father. Things grew worse in 1949 when her brother, José Rolando Martínez Bonilla, participated in the failed Luperón invasion, an attempted rebellion against Trujillo. Though he survived, it was the final straw that pushed Carmen Natalia and her family into exile.  Exile  The regime was after Carmen Natalia and her family, and in 1950 she was exiled to Puerto Rico. There, she continued her literary career, frequently writing about the country she had left behind. In 1959, she won first prize from the Ateneo Puertorriqueño for her poem \\"Llanto sin término por el hijo nunca llegado\\" (\\"Endless Crying for the Child Who Never Arrived\\"). She ran the Puerto Rican magazine Ventanas and worked on adaptations of her literary work for television and radio.  Return to the Dominican Republic  Carmen Natalia returned to the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's death in 1961. Under the new Dominican government, she was chosen to speak at the United Nations and at the Organization of American States, where she called for the defense of women's rights. She also served as a delegate for the Dominican Republic to the UNICEF Executive Board. In 1963, she was chosen as president of the Inter-American Commission of Women.  Death and legacy  After many years of living with muscular dystrophy, Carmen Natalia died in Santo Domingo in 1976. A collection of her poetic work, Poesías: Obra poética completa, 1939-1976, was published in 1981 by the Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra.  Style  Carmen Natalia wrote poems on a wide variety of subjects, everything from love to the feminine condition to her deep hatred for the regime. Her poetry spanned different movements and is difficult to categorize, with elements of postmodernism.

The house was built in 1929 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The site was demolished and delisted in 2015.  History  Glenridge Hall was built by Atlanta businessman and co-founder of Georgia Power Thomas K. Glenn in 1929. Located on of farmland north of Atlanta in what is now Sandy Springs, the Tudor Revival house was designed by Atlanta architect Samuel Inman Cooper and required approximately a year for 60 men to build. The house would serve as Glenn's residence until his death in 1946. Starting in the early 1980s, Glenn's granddaughter began to restore the house, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In the following years, the building was used for many charitable events and fundraisers, and it was used as a filming location for such films and series as Driving Miss Daisy and The Vampire Diaries. By Summer 2014, only about of the original property remained part of the estate. In July of that year, the property was put up for sale. Later that year, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation placed the property on its 2015 list of Places in Peril. In 2015, it was announced that the house would be demolished to make way for Mercedes- Benz's U.S. headquarters and for residential developments by Roswell, Georgia- based homebuilding company Ashton Woods. Following this announcement, historic preservationists in the area voiced their objection to the house's destruction, and they created a petition on Change.org arguing against its destruction. By April 2015, the petition had over 15,000 signatures. Despite this, the mansion was demolished on April 9.

Enacted in 1975 when the UK’s first North Sea oil was produced, the Act aimed to provide greater public control of the oil industry. The Act established the British National Oil Corporation and a National Oil Account; modified the conditions of petroleum licences; controlled the construction and use of underground pipelines; and controlled the development of oil refineries.  Background  The incoming Labour government in October 1974 perceived significant deficiencies in the control and operation of the UK petroleum industry. One of Labour’s election manifesto pledges was to: \\"Take majority participation in all future oil licences and negotiate to achieve majority State participation in existing licences. Set up a British National Oil Corporation … Take new powers to control the pace of depletion, pipelines, exploration and development\\". The BNOC was to have several functions: holding production licences with private sector partners; commercial trading in downstream activities; exploration to establish the extent of reserves; providing expert services to the government; and acting as an agent of the government. The BNOC would provide resources to allow participation of the private sector in development of offshore oil. It would establish the conditions under which licences were awarded. It was also thought desirable that the government should have the power to make loans and to guarantee loans to oil companies developing discoveries in the North Sea. Furthermore, there was perceived to be little control over the development of oil pipelines to avoid unnecessary proliferation, to minimise damage, and to reduce the risk of pollution. Neither was there control over the safety of pipelines and protection of people laying them under hazardous conditions. Finally, the national policy on oil was generally not taken into account in decisions on oil refinery construction. To better exploit North Sea oil there was a need to have appropriate types of refining capacity. The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 aimed to address these issues and implement the proposals.  Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975  The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 (1975 c. 74) received Royal Assent on 12 November 1975. Its long title is: ‘An Act to establish the British National Oil Corporation and make provision with respect to the functions of the Corporation; to make further provision about licences to search for and get petroleum and about submarine pipe-lines and refineries; to authorise loans and guarantees in connection with the development of the petroleum resources of the United Kingdom and payments in respect of certain guarantees and loans by the Bank of England; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.’  Provisions  The Act comprises 49 Sections in 5 Parts and 4 Schedules: * PART I The British National Oil Corporation ** Constitution – Section 1 – Constitution of the Corporation ** General functions of the Corporation – Sections 2 to 4 – General powers, duties and directions by the Secretary of State ** Financial provisions – Sections 5 to 10 – General financial duties, borrowing powers etc., loans by the Secretary of State, guarantees, exemption from petroleum revenue tax and stamp duty, accounts and audit, duty of the Corporation ** Miscellaneous – Sections 11 to 16 – provision of information, co-ordination of the Corporation and the British Gas Corporation, shares of NCB (Exploration) Ltd., annual report * PART II Petroleum production licences ** Sections 17 to 19 – modification of model clauses, retrospective application to existing licences * PART III Submarine pipe-lines ** Construction and use of pipe-lines – Sections 20 to 25 – control of construction and use, authorisations for pipe-lines, increases in capacity, rights to use pipe-lines, termination of authorisations, vesting ** Safety and inspection – Sections 26 & 27 – safety and Inspectors ** Criminal and civil liability – Sections 28 to 30 – enforcement, criminal proceedings, civil liability ** Supplemental – Section 31 to 33 – exclusion, regulations, interpretation * PART IV Refineries ** Sections 34 to 39 – control of construction and extension, authorisations, planning permission, inspectors, offences, Scotland and Northern Ireland * PART V Miscellaneous and General ** Miscellaneous – Sections 40 to 44 – National Oil Account, payments to petroleum licence holders, loans to promote development, Burmah Oil Co. Ltd., extension of Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 ** General – Sections 45 to 49 – amendments of enactments, orders and regulations, expenses, interpretation, commencement and extent * Schedules ** Schedule 1 – Additional provisions of British National Oil Corporation ** Schedule 2 – Production licences for seaward areas ** Schedule 3 – Production licences for landward areas ** Schedule 4 – Authorisations for Section 20  Consequences of the Act  The British National Oil Corporation was formally established on 13 November 1975. Lord Kearton was the Chairman and Chief Executive, and Alastair Morton was one of the four managing directors. BNOC took over the oil and gas assets of NCB (Exploration) Ltd. a subsidiary of the National Coal Board. From February 1976 BNOC’s capital expenditure budget for the following 15 months was £450 million. The BNOC could negotiate the right to buy back up to 51 per cent of an oil field’s production. In practice this was sold back to companies to refine. In 1976 BNOC obtained the majority of Burmah Oil Company’s UK interests in the Ninian and Thistle fields. BNOC thereby became an operating oil company. The Labour government had intended to buy its way into oil finds as a full licensee with a 51 per cent interest. However, the government decided to participate through negotiated agreements where it had the right to take at market price up to 51 per cent of crude oil and natural gas liquids, and any natural gas not purchased by the British Gas Corporation. The Secretary of State for Energy made the Submarine Pipe-lines (Inspectors etc.) Regulations 1977 Statutory Instrument 1977 No. 835 and appointed inspectors into the Petroleum Engineering Division of the Department of Energy.  Later enactments  Under the terms of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 the British National Oil Corporation was split into an oil production organisation – Britoil – which was floated on the stock exchange in 1982 and 1985, and a residuary trading arm. The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 repealed Part 1 (Sections 1-16) of the 1975 Act and formally abolished the British National Oil Corporation and transferred its property, rights and liabilities to the Oil and Pipelines Agency. The Petroleum Act 1987, made provision for the abandonment of offshore installations and submarine pipe-lines; it amended the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934; and amended the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975. The 1987 Act repealed Sections 34 to 39 of the 1975 Act relating to oil refineries. The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 was repealed on 15 February 1999 under the provisions of the Petroleum Act 1998.

It is be used for space research, launching and recovering rockets before their final launch into orbit. The advantage of the site is that there is a vast area of land on which the rockets may be recovered. Members of the local community have been employed to set up and operate the range. DEWC Systems, an Adelaide-based company, conducted two launches at the range in September 2020. A rocket containing a small replica payload was scheduled to be launched from the site on 15 September 2020, with a second launch on 19 September.

The commission has been able to certify five WHO regions as having eradicated wild poliovirus, with the Eastern Mediterranean Region being the sole remaining region yet to gain certification. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a related initiative begun by the WHO in 1988, has been able to reduce wild poliovirus cases by 99.99% through vaccination.  History  The first meeting of the Global Certification Commission was convened in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16–17 February 1995. The commission was initially established as a 13-person board and assigned the responsibility of delineating the criterion for verification and certification of the eradication of the wild poliovirus. The World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization, had also created the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988 with the resolution to eradicate the disease by 2000. As of August 2020, the WHO partners with the Rotary International, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance while working towards the goals of the GPEI. The global eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) was certified in September 2015. The last detection of indigenous WPV2 was in 1999. Indigenous wild poliovirus type 3 was last detected in 2012 and its global eradication was certified in October 2015. Wild poliovirus type 1 is the only form of the virus that remains uninterrupted.  Structure  The Global Certification Commission is the top-level decision making body of a three-tier process. Each WHO member state's national polio program appoints a National Certification Committee. These national committees meet annually to draft a report on polio surveillance and eradication. These reports are evaluated by Regional Certification Committees, expert panels appointed by the WHO with members that are independent of both the national committees and the GPEI. There are six Regional Certification Committees, one for each WHO region. The regional committees meet annually to review the reports of the national committees. The chairs of the six regional committees comprise the Global Certification Commission. They meet irregularly as needed for global decision making.  Regional certification  thumbupright=1.9 The six WHO regions with a marker for the locations of WHO regional headquarters, which may be different from the Regional Certification Commission headquarters By 1994, the disease had been certified to be eradicated in the Americas, one of the six WHO-designated regions. The Western Pacific region was certified in 2000. From these early experiences, the WHO established a criterion for certification: three years of no new detection of wild poliovirus in the face of strict surveillance, where surveillance is further defined as the finding and examination of at least one case of nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis per 100,000 children under 15 years old – implying that wild poliovirus would be detected if in existence in the country or region. With the criteria established, the commission resolved to certify each of the remaining regions until the disease was eradicated globally. The European Region was certified in 2004 and the South-East Asia Region in 2014. In 1996, African nations signed the Yaoundé Declaration on Polio Eradication in Africa, and Nelson Mandela started the \\"Kick Polio out of Africa\\" campaign. The WHO regional director for Africa appointed 16 people to the Africa Regional Certification Commission (ARCC) in 1998. Based in Yaoundé, Cameroon, and led by Rose Leke as chairperson as of 2020, the group was tasked with overseeing the eradication effort in the Africa WHO region. The independent body is the only organisation recognized to certify that polio has been eradicated from the region. On 25 August 2020, the ARCC declared that wild poliovirus has been eliminated in its region which includes 47 countries spanning most of Africa. The last reported case of polio in the region was on 21 August 2016, in Borno, Nigeria. Among the conditions for certification of the region was a requirement that 95% of the population be immunised. Cases of polio have seen an 99.99% decline globally since the start of the polio eradication initiative: \\"From 350 000 cases annually in 125 countries in 1988, to 102 cases in two countries in 2020 as of [August] 19.\\" The Eastern Mediterranean Region is the only WHO region that has yet to be certified as having eradicated wild poliovirus. The region includes 22 countries spanning from Morocco to Pakistan, several of which have individually eradicated the disease. This region experiences significant political unrest, humanitarian crises, forced displacement, and deterioration of health care systems, which cripple eradication efforts. Syria, Yemen, and Somalia are categorized as very-high-risk, and Iraq, Sudan, and Libya are categorized as high-risk, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in which the disease remains endemic as of 2019. Since 2007, people administering polio vaccines have been the target of violence in Pakistan. A 2011 US Central Intelligence Agency operation used a hepatitis vaccination program as a cover to search DNA evidence to confirm the location of Osama bin Laden. Following his killing the same year, Islamist insurgents in the region have become more hostile to vaccination efforts. More recently, the hostility has been exasperated by the United States' expansion of the use of drone strikes in northwest Pakistan; in June 2012, Mullah Nazir, leader of the Federally Administered Tribal Agencies, distributed leaflets calling for a ban on polio vaccination with the goal of persuading the US to stop drone strikes in the area.

Promoted to Brigadier General in 1905, he was killed in action at a ravine called Barranco del Lobo, during the Second Melillan campaign, leading a column of light infantry that was ambushed by Riffians at the foothills of the Mount Gurugu.  Biography  Born on 26 January 1856, in the Chafarinas Islands, less than a decade after their occupation by Spain carried out by the General Serrano. He joined the Valencia regiment as cadet in 1872, yet a year later, in July 1873, he shifted to the Infantry Academy. Promoted to the rank of Alférez in April 1874, he was destined to the Zamora regiment, part of the Army of the North during the Third Carlist War. He participated in many battles of the conflict, including (June 1874), (August 1874), and the lifting of the (February 1875), remaining in the campaign until the end of the war in 1876. He joined the Army of Cuba later in 1876, joining the Expeditionary Battalion 32, taking part in operations against Cuban separatists. He belonged to the battalion of jägers of Morón, to the regiment of Cuba and to the battalion of jägers of Reus, and remained in the island until June 1878, returning after to Mainland Spain. Destined to the Philippines, he was appointed as aide-de-camp of Valeriano Weyler in May 1888. In Manila, he also served as governor of the city prison. He was destined to Mindanao in 1891, where he took part in actions against moro insurgents in Bara, Malalí, Malabang and Laguna de Lanao, earning the rank of commander and returning to Manila in October 1891, and soon after, embarking to return to the Iberian Peninsula. He went with Weyler to Cuba, taking part in many actions of the Cuban War. Ill, he returned to the Mainland Spain in 1897, where he continued serving as aid of Weyler throughout different posts held by the latter. He was appointed to lead the 31st Infantry Regiment \\"Asturias\\" in July 1901. He was promoted to Brigadier General on 30 June 1905. Generals Marina and Pintos José Marina Vega entrusted him and his brigade with the vigilance over the area of the Wolf and the Alfer Ravines, in the foothills of the Mount Gurugu (to the south of Melilla), where Riffians were supposed to be strong. The column (formed by 6 battalions) departed on 27 July; although Pinto only needed to keep the Riffians at a distance, he compromised the whole brigade for an advance into the ravine of the Barranco del Lobo. The left wing of the column was ambushed at the ravine by the enemy, who fired at them from the heights. Light infantry departing Melilla on 27 July The command underestimated the enemy and their favourable position and the Spanish soldiers repeatedly tried to clear them from their positions with no success. A disastrous retreat without artillery support was attempted later, leading to severe losses. Pintos had died before in the early stages of the operation, as having dismounted from his horse to rest, after advancing some positions with the right wing of the column near the ravine attempting to take the hill of Ait Aixa, a Riffian sniper killed him putting a bullet in his skull. The operation (that came to be known as the ) caused 750 Spanish casualties (including wounded and killed) and was the worst defeat suffered by the Spanish army during the Second Melillan campaign.

History The facility was established in 1986 as a two-court indoor community netball stadium known as the Wendouree Netball Centre. During the late 2000s the popularity of Basketball, Netball and Badminton in the Ballarat region had significantly outgrown the capacity of existing stadia built during the 1970s at the nearby Hollioake Park sports complex. The Hollioake Park venues including the Ballarat Minerdome Basketball Stadium and the 'Ken Kay' Badminton Stadium, whilst extremely well maintained and modernised, their limited sizes impacted Ballarat's competitiveness in securing major indoor sports competitions as they were under heavy pressure from local demand. This prompted combined councils in the Ballarat region as well as Ballarat's indoor sporting associations to collectively advocate for funding to re-develop and expand the Wendouree Netball Centre into a major regional indoor multi-use sporting complex. After several years of lobbying for funding assistance, the Victorian State government in 2015 granted $9 miilion financial support in addition to the Ballarat Council's commitment of $5 million to ensure that some $14 million (AUD) would jointly fund the first stage of a new Ballarat Sports and Events Centre project as a strategic component of the Ballarat Major Events Precinct Master Plan (Released in June 2015). Under the initial funding arrangement, a partial stadium complex would be designed and built connecting to the existing Wendouree Netball Centre that would add four new indoor courts and include a 1500-seat main arena. The design was to make provision for future expansion as an eight court facility featuring a 3000-seat main arena once additional funding could be secured. Several months later, before construction commenced, the Australian Commonwealth Government granted $10 million (AUD) under its 'Regional Development Fund' enabling full completion of the complex. During the 2018 Victorian State election the Victorian State government committed a final grant of $5.2 million to renovate and re-skin the adjoining older Wendouree Netball Centre which would fully integrate it to compliment the new facility. These monies would also fund construction of outdoor three-on-three courts for community use, a new sports clinic and upgraded gymnasium facilities. More recently the venue has been proposed to be the primary Netball venue as part of a campaign by Regional Victorian Councils to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games. Basketball venue Since officially opening in July 2019, the venue has hosted a number of premier games including National Basketball League (Australia) friendly games as well as NBL1 competition games. The venue had secured significant other national competitions to be hosted throughout 2020, however due to the suspension of many major sports competitions in Australia resultant from the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak these were postponed but not cancelled.

The LMDh regulations were created jointly by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), and the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. The class will serve as the successor to the Daytona Prototype International class, with the class utilising regulations that were planned to become the next- generation Daytona Prototype International ruleset.  History = DPi 2.0  Following the FIA World Endurance Championship's transition to a winter calendar in 2018, IMSA announced in January 2018, that it would extend the homologation periods for LMP2, DPi and GTE-spec machinery in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship by an additional year. This would delay the homologation periods in the championship by roughly six months, which necessitated the homologation extension from IMSA. As such, the DPi and LMP2 cars, which were originally confirmed for a four-year period through 2020, would now be eligible for competition until at least the end of the 2021 season. Despite calls from manufacturers to retain the DPi platform and regulations for the 2022 season, then-IMSA President Scott Atherton announced that IMSA was looking at other options beyond a further extension to the life of the DPi platform. On May 6 2019, IMSA announced that the next generation DPi ruleset, known as DPi 2.0 would be an evolution based on the current LMP2-based platform, featuring Hybrid technology from a single supplier, with supply voltage being unconfirmed. A few days later, IMSA's VP of Competition Simon Hodgson stated that the next-generation DPi regulations would be expected to feature increased styling measures, by opening up more areas where manufacturers were able to add styling cues. Hodgson also indicated that the enlarged scope for styling cues may also come alongside regulations that dictated minimum level of styling required from each manufacturer. On June 24 2019, it was revealed that IMSA had held discussions with manufacturers regarding the incorporation of hybrid technology in the next-generation DPi ruleset, with manufacturers on the DPi 2.0 steering committee divided over the level electrification in the hybrid systems. Electrification concepts proposed included high and low-voltage systems of varying costs. A further meeting held in late June saw a 400-volt system, providing in the range of 70-90 kW (90-120 hp) of electric power emerge as the leading electrification option. However, despite 400-volt systems having emerged as the leading option in June, it was revealed in September that discussions had yet to reach any form of consensus, although it was agreed that manufacturers could build their own hybrid systems.  DPi 2.0-LMH Convergence  Following the 2019 \\"Super Sebring\\" weekend which saw the 2019 12 Hours of Sebring held on the same weekend as the inaugural 1000 Miles of Sebring, WEC CEO Gerard Neveu revealed the possibility of DPi becoming included as part of the \\"Hypercar\\" regulations, with the integration of DPis depending on the performance levels of both platforms. On July 31, 2019, FIA World Endurance Championship CEO Gerard Neveu revealed that an active effort was underway between the ACO and IMSA technical departments to seek similar performance targets between Hypercar and DPi 2.0, which would allow for both platforms to eventually crossover and compete head to head. On November 11, 2019, WEC's sole LMP1 manufacturer Toyota stated it would be open for DPi integration into the FIA World Endurance Championship’s top class, on the condition it would not hinder the Japanese manufacturer from displaying it's hybrid technology. Shortly after the release of the LMH Technical regulations, McLaren announced it would not be considering a LMH programme, and instead called for DPi to be brought into the WEC, with McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown stating that a LMH programme was unviable for the British manufacturer, calling for steep reduction in costs. Ford and Porsche expressed similar sentiments, calling for convergence between LMH and DPi. On 15 January 2020, Toyota Racing Development president and general manager David Wilson expressed support for convergence between both platforms, stating that convergence of the 2 platforms would serve as a compelling reason for Lexus to launch a DPi programme.  Le Mans Daytona h (LMDh)  On 24 January 2020, ahead of the 2020 24 Hours of Daytona, a joint ACO-IMSA Press Conference was held at the Daytona International Speedway, where ACO and IMSA announced the new LMDh class, which would supersede the Daytona Prototype International class. LMDh was planned to be first introduced in Europe starting in September of 2021, before having it's North American debut in 2022 at the 2022 Rolex 24 at Daytona. Despite initial plans to allow manufacturers to build their own hybrid systems, this was scrapped in the draft Le Mans Daytona h regulations released in May, in favour of a spec 50hp hybrid system. The draft regulations stated that a car weight of 1030 kg, 500 kW peak of combined power from engine and hybrid system, a single bodywork package, a single tyre supplier, alongside a global Balance of Performance system to balance out LMDh and LMH cars.

She was an active member of, and regular exhibitor with, the Art Society of Tasmania. Her work is held in the permanent collection of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.  Early life and education  Vimpany was born in 1886 in Forcett, Tasmania, one of eight children (four girls and four boys) of Walter Alomes and Emma Jane Parker. She studied art at Hobart Technical College in 1928 and 1931 to 1932, under the tutelage of Belgian-born Australian artist, Lucien Dechaineux.  Career  During the 1930s Vimpany shared a studio at 76 Collins Street in Hobart with other women artists of the time, including Edith Holmes, Mildred Lovett, Ethel Nicholls, Florence Rodway, and Dorothy Stoner. It is presumed that during this time Holmes painted the artwork Portrait of Violet Vimpany (Masterpiece Fine Art Gallery Hobart). From 1936 to 1939, when in her fifties, Vimpany regularly traveled from Hobart to Melbourne to study with Scottish-born Australian artist and art teacher, Max Meldrum. Her work became highly regarded and was exhibited in the 1939 exhibition, International Women: Painter, Sculptors, Gravers, held at the Riverside Museum (now the Master Building) in Manhattan, New York. Vimpany was a council member of the Art Society of Tasmania from 1936 to 1952, and exhibited with them for over forty years (1932–1975). As a philanthropist and champion of women’s rights, she was a member of the Hobart Soroptimist Club (changing to the Soroptimist International of Hobart in the 1970s) – an organisation which advocates for human rights, gender equality, and advancing the status of women. Her husband died suddenly from a heart attack in 1945, and at the age of 60, she took over his stonemasonry business. Mastering the skills of the masonry trade, she successfully ran the business for over twenty years. Selling the business in 1969, she retired definitively in 1973, and in that same year was named one of Tasmania’s ‘Women of Achievement’. In 2019, she was listed as one of 156 \\"Women who shaped Australian art\\". She was honorary secretary of the National Council for Women from 1938 to 1940, elected president in 1945, and served as delegate for the NCW at UNRRA in 1945.

Nylander was born in Oulu to magistrate Anders and his wife Margareta Magdalena Fahlander. He was educated at Oulu Grammar School and later in Turku and Helsinki. He studied natural sciences at the Imperial Alexander University majoring in botany and zoology and graduated in 1840 after some travels around Europe in 1839. He received an MS in the same year and then studied botany under Elias Fries and from 1843 to 1846 he studied Botany in St Petersburg under F. E. L. Fischer. In 1842 he travelled around Fennoscandia collecting plants and published part of the Spicilegium Plantarum Fennicarum (1843) and received a Phil. Lic. degree in 1844 and a Ph.D. in 1844. He then explored the Kola peninsula. He applied for a position in the Imperial Alexander University in 1844 but this was taken up by Reinhold Ferdinand Sahlberg. He applied again in 1847 but failed again. In 1849 he quit botany and began studies in medicine, receiving a license in 1853. He practiced in Oulu and also became a parliament member in 1872. Nylander was a member of the Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica from 1836 and was in charge of its collections which were destroyed in 1827 in the great fire of Turku. The collections were rebuilt and Nylander donated most of his collections to it. Nylander married Ida Babette Hummel and they had three children.

Founded in 1992, it publishes three major Namibian newspapers, the Afrikaans-language Republikein, the German Allgemeine Zeitung, and the Namibian Sun in English. It also runs the Newsprint Namibia printing works, and the radio station 99FM. History NMH developed from the Republikein Group, the publishing house of the Republikein, Namibia's only daily in Afrikaans founded in 1977 by Dirk Mudge. In August 1991 the Group bought and incorporated the publisher John Meinert Printing which in turn owned the Deutscher Verlag, the publisher of the German-language daily Allgemeine Zeitung, and also published the weekly Windhoek Advertiser. It further founded its own printing works, Newsprint Namibia. The rights to John Meinert Printing were sold in 1999. Namibia Media Holdings was founded as Democratic Media Holdings (Pty) Ltd in 1992 by a trust established for this purpose, the Democratic Media Trust of Namibia. In 2014 it was renamed Namibia Media Holdings. Products and ownership The company publishes three major Namibian newspapers. The Afrikaans-language Republikein was incorporated into NMH at its inception. The German Allgemeine Zeitung, published since 1916 and the oldest German daily in Africa, was bought by the publishing house John Meinert in 1934, which in turn was sold to NMH in 1991. The Namibian Sun, a weekly newspaper established in 2007 and a daily since 2010, is a tabloid launched to \\"attract young readers\\". With the acquisition of John Meinert, Namibia Media Holdings also obtained Namibia's only large printing works. The Namibian, New Era and Namibia Today, were all printed at NMH. The radio station 99FM was obtained in 2007. With interests in three major newspapers, ownership of the printing press and stakes in radio, Robin Tyson argued in 2008 that NMH wass \\"dominant [...] in the Namibian media market\\". During that time the publishing and printing industry diversified somewhat. Free Press Printers, owned by Trustco, was established in 2006 and prints The Namibian as well as the weekly tabloid Informante. NMH is owned by Stimulus Investments, a Namibian investment company. Stimulus holds 50% via its subsidiary Desert Trade Investments (Pty) Ltd, and the other 50% directly after buying it from the South African media publisher Media24.

The ridge actually consists of two parallel narrow ridge segments with a 0,5 km wide valley in between. Sveifluháls is also called Austurháls in contrast to its parallel ridge on the other side of Móhálsadalur, the Núpshlídarháls ridge, which is also called Vesturháls.Reynir Ingibjartsson: 25 Gönguleiðir á Reykjanesskaga.

Grosse: Morphometry of subaerial shield volcanoes and glaciovolcanoes from Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland: Effects of eruption environment. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 282, (2014), 115-133. It consists as is usual for such subglacially formed volcanoes, of pillow lavas under a layer of phreatomagmatic tephra (hyaloclastite). Pedersen and her coworkers think that the Ice Age glacier which was covering it at time of formation had a thickness between 70 and 400 m. Formation of Sveifluháls Mercurio postulates that the ridge formation started with eruptions under a 450 – 600 m thick ice sheet between 42.000 – 12,400 years BP. The melting of glacier ice induced the formation of one or more subglacial meltwater lakes. Dropping overburden pressures lead to the eruption of vitric phreatomagmatic tuff. Over time this tuff accumulated and formed circular tuff cones, elongated tuff cones and ridges, volcanic edifices that were arranged “along 60 semi-parallel individual linear segments” (i.e. eruption fissures - in this case subglacial ones) “that vary in length between 0,25 and 1,5 km.” Emily Constantine Mercurio: Processes, Products and Depositional Environments of Ice-Confined Basaltic Fissure Eruptions: A Case Study of the Sveifluháls Volcanic Complex, SW Iceland. University of Pittsburgh. (2011) Retrieved 26 August 2020. In the following time, these edifices grew and developed further by subaqueous density currents and resuspense resp. settling of the tuff within the meltwater lakes. This was facilitated by over steepening or retreat of the ice walls around the growing volcano. Igneous intrusions into the piles of tuff also helped destabilizing them. The tuff cones and ridges grew and merged, but they also enclosed a source of jökulhlaup in between them, inter-ridge meltwater catchments with volumes of up to 15 000 000 m3. In the whole, the eruptions of Sveifluháls may have produced 17.25 km3 of meltwater and a DRE of 2,0 km3. In the end, the meltwater lakes drained and at least one of the eruption centers produced subaerial lava, which means that there is a tuya component in the ridge, not all of it was produced by subglacial eruptions. The eruption in the whole was probably similar to the Gjálp eruption within the Grímsvötn Volcanic System in 1996. Geothermal activity at Sveifluháls Especially in two areas, geothermal activity at Sveifluháls is intense and connected to Krysuvík volcanic system. These are Seltún on the one hand, and the hills behind the farm and school of Krýsuvík on the other hand (so called Hveradalir). Hot ground, fumaroles, hot springs and mud pots are to be found there. Measurements in Seltún even show a thermal output of about 4 MW. Hydrothermal alteration and this heat lead to precipitation of minerals like hematite, goethite and different sulfur compounds. Hiking Many hiking trails lead up on Sveifluháls or are to be found in the vicinity. For example, there are trails up from Seltún at the southern end of the ridge to Arnarvatn and from there into the Móhálsadalur, or for hiking a round to Hetta, one of the southernmost summits of the long Sveifluháls ridge.Reynir Ingibjartsson: 25 Gönguleiðir á Reykjanesskaga.

Clarke first went to Jamaica in 1829 and worked as a teacher and Baptist minister in Kingston, Spanish Town, and elsewhere until 1840, when he was sent with George K. Prince to investigate the possibilities of founding a mission in West Africa. They landed in Fernando Po in January 1841.Clarke (1877); Dekar (2001). In 1842 Clarke went back to Jamaica and England to recruit volunteers for the mission, returning in February 1844 with a party of Jamaican teachers and settlers, among them the 18-year-old Joseph Jackson Fuller, who was later to become famous himself as a missionary.Newman (2001), p. 222. The mission on the island of Fernando Po was not a success, and was eventually forced to close in 1858, mainly due to restrictions from the Spanish authorities, who claimed the island and were determined to make it Catholic;Dekar (2001). but the mission which the Baptists founded on the Cameroonian mainland opposite the island survived until it was taken over by the Basel Mission Society in 1886.Newman (2001), pp. 224, 228. Clarke himself became ill and in 1847 he and his wife went back to Jamaica, and then in 1848 to England.Clarke (1877). After a time he returned to Jamaica, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life.Clarke (1877). John Clarke got married in Berwick-upon-Tweed to a wife, Margaret, from that town in 1829, shortly before setting out for Jamaica. They remained together for more than 40 years until she died.

History According to tradition, St. Thomas Monastery was founded by St. Bartholomew the Apostle in the 1st century, and his pupil, Kums (hy), was appointed its priest. It was probably a small chapel-like building that was rebuilt and expanded after the conversion of Armenia to Christianity. It was the centre of Goghtn parish, from the early Middle Ages to 1838. In the monastery there were some relics: right hand of Thomas the Apostle donated by Catholicos Yeprem I in 1821, relic of St. Gayané (fr) and right hand of Hakop Hayrapet. The monastery had a cemetery belonging to the 13th to 19th centuries. It was located about 250 m northeast of the complex. Architecture St. Thomas Monastery consisted of a temple, bell towers, a wall and auxiliary buildings. The church of the monastery was probably damaged by the earthquake of 1679 and in 1694 a completely new church was built, with polished basalt, reddish felsite, a seven-sided tabernacle on the inside and a dome-shaped basilica with four crosses. St. Thomas Monastery in early 20th century St. Thomas Monastery St. Thomas Monastery  Current status In 1918, Turkish troops destroyed Agulis, massacred the Armenian population and looted the monastery, which was later abandoned and deserted.

Concept LCEVC specifies an enhancement layer which, when combined with a base video encoded with a separate codec, produces an enhanced video stream. The base layer is decodable by a hardware decoder, and the enhancement layer is suitable for software processing implementation with sustainable power consumption. The enhancement layer provides improved features to existing codecs, such as compression capability extension and lower encoding/decoding complexity, for live streaming or broadcasting applications. LCEVC leverages a base video codec (e.g., AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, EVC or VVC) and employs an efficient low-complexity enhancement that adds up to two layers of encoded residuals, along with normative signalled up-sampling methods, that correct artefacts produced by the base video codec and add detail and sharpness for the final output video. It provides additional compression efficiency to any existing or future video codec and reduces the processing complexity of encoding and decoding. LCEVC can be implemented with software updates for encoders and decoders, and was designed to leverage available hardware acceleration for graphics processing. History In October 2018, MPEG issued a set of requirements for a new video coding standard and a Call for Proposals[11] for Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding.

He was also known by the title, Chief of Kagoro. Life and education Gwamna Awan was born in Ucyio (Fadan Kagoro) in 1915. His educational career began in 1928 where all through till 1932 he attended evening classes, before proceeding to the Elementary Teachers Centre, Toro (now in Bauchi State) between 1933–1935. Career As soon as the program ended at Toro, Awan returned home to begin teaching at the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM) Elementary School, Gworok (Kagoro) from 1936. He was later transferred to the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM) Elementary School, Fantswam (Kafanchan) in 1938. In the course of his early career, he combined where combined teaching with evangelism, as did the Christian missionaries. After about a year in 1939, he returned to teach at the Elementary Teachers Centre in Gworok. When uncle, Biya Kaka, the then Chief of Kagoro needed him to join the Gworok (Kagoro) Native Authority, he was available and was made the Assistant Scribe in 1940. He was instrumental in the execution of many developmental projects the construction of a modern (the present) palace in 1943, as well as manual water pumps at the front of the palace for the people to have access to clean water. He also improved on the tax collection system and promoted education of the citizens of the chiefdom. Kingship=Royal tussle After the demise of Chief Biya Kaka in August 1944, there was a delay in the appointment of a successor due to the tussle over who should become the next monarch. There were two candidates vying for the position: an animist and a Christian in the person of Gwamna Awan who got strong backing from the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM) who pressured the British colonial authorities to select their candidate to succeed Kaka. At the end, Awan was appointed the acting Chief, and subsequently installed formally as the first Christian monarch in the whole of the southern part of Zaria Province and 5th Chief of Kagoro by G. D. Pitcairn, the British colonial Resident of Zaria Province on April 11, 1945. Challenges Awan's ascendancy was to the SIM missionaries a major breakthrough to spread Christianity across the region. Already, they had made Gworok town their headquarters in the southern part of Zaria province. However, his ascendancy was seen as a threat to the Zaria Emirate aristocrats who envisaged a danger to their interest in the Atyap area and the neighborhood due to the continuous enlightenment through education; Christian missionary activities by the SIM and its members; and more threatening, the tendency of the new western-educated Christian chief aiding the Atyap against them. In May 1946, there was a revolt by the Atyap in the Zangon Katab district, north of the independent Chiefdom of Gworok, who wanted their separation from the Zaria Emirate and the creation of an Atyap Chiefdom and Awan was blamed by the Emir of Zaria, as reported by the British colonial Resident, G. D. Pitcairn, for escalating the crisis. In the report, Pitcairn wrote: On a subsequent visit to Gworok (Kagoro) by Pitcairn where he met with Awan to confirm the Emir's allegations, he ended up warning Awan to avoid such acts. Death Gwamna Awan was the longest-serving traditional ruler in Northern and Middle Belt (central) and the entire Nigeria and in Africa as at the time of his demise in the early morning hours of Wednesday October 1, 2008 at the age of 93 at the ECWA Evangelical Hospital, Jos, after a protracted illness. Among other monarchs of the old Northern Region of Colonial Nigeria, like Attah of Igala, Aliyu Obaje (56 years); Sultan of Sokoto, Abubakar III (50 years); Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero (51 years); Emir of Daura, Muhammadu Bashar (41 years); Lamido of Adamawa, Aliyu Mustapha (57 years); Sarkin Katagum, Muhammadu Kabir (37 years); Emir of Lafia, Mustafa Agwai (43 years); Emir of Daura, Abdurrahman (1911-1966); Awan had the longest reign of 63 years.

Biography  She was the third and last of the children of the marriage formed by Duke Alexander of Württemberg and Countess Claudine de Hohenstein (born Countess Rhédey de Kis- Rhéde). As the latter did not belong to any reigning or mediated house, the marriage was declared morganatic and her mother was granted the title of Countess of Hohenstein by Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. This last title was the one that both Amalie and her siblings carried from their birth. Her brothers were: * Countess Claudine of Hohenstein (1836-1894), later Princess of Teck, single; * Count Francis of Hohenstein (1837-1900), later Prince of Teck and Duke of Teck, married to Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge; She was orphaned in 1841, after her mother died as a result of a horse accident. She spent her childhood and youth in Vienna with her father and brothers. On 13 October 1863, she married Count Paul von Hügel, an Austrian officer. After the wedding, they moved to Reinthal Castle, near Graz, owned by her husband's family. Her sister Claudine moved into a Swiss-style chalet near the castle. He had a quiet and provincial life with his family with occasional visits from his brother Francis and his wife Mary Adelaide, as well as his children, among whom was Mary of Teck, future queen consort of the United Kingdom. On 16 December 1871, her cousin Charles I of Württemberg raised her to princess of Teck, just as his father, William I of Württemberg, had done with his brothers on 1 December 1863. She died in 1893 as a result of cancer. She was buried in the cemetery of St. Peter in Graz.

The song was written and produced by Mike Scott, with additional production by Rupert Hine. Background \\"December\\" was written in Ayr, Scotland, and recorded at Redshop in December 1981 and Farmyard in June 1982. It was one of the first songs recorded by Scott for what went on to become the Waterboys. At the time, Scott was a member of the band Funhouse and wishing to leave and pursue a new musical path, he recorded three of his own tracks at Redshop in December 1981, including \\"December\\", with the engineer Jim Preen. Using pre-recorded drum loops available at the studio, Scott performed all instrumentation himself. Scott recorded the song's rhythm and two lead parts using his Danelectro \\"Bellzouki\\" 12-string guitar. In his autobiography, he said of the song's recording: \\"I laid it down in about thirty minutes - seven minutes for each overdub, and just about time to breathe in between. As the multiple-Bellzouki sound took shape, I was astonished at its breadth, and also at my own playing: the Bellzouki had inspired me beyond my limits, and the sound of my inner imagination was coming out of a pair of speaks in front of me.\\" Additional recording on the track was carried out at Farmyard Studios in June 1982, with Rupert Hine providing additional production. In 1984, U2 singer Bono included \\"December\\" in a list of his top ten records of 1983 for Rolling Stone. Critical reception On its release as a single, Betty Page of Record Mirror commented: \\"Whimper, whimper. This week's 90th moody, tremulous ballad with lashings of tearful vibrato and acoustic twelve-strings. A record to sit down and listen to as the leaves fall, it informs us that 'December is the cool month'. Oh really?\\" Barney Hoskyns of New Musical Express gave the single a rating of six out of ten. He described it as a \\"big acoustic anatomy of melancholy\\" and added that it was \\"too long and involved for a single, but nice all the same\\". In a review of the mini-album edition of The Waterboys, Diana Valois of The Morning Call considered the song to be \\"about coming of age\\" and noted the \\"fat and flavorful guitar work\\". Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone described \\"December\\" as a \\"longish song, more meditative though no less inquisitive, as Scott, like Van Morrison, goes looking for the proverbial lion in the soul\\".

To classify in the broad meaning given above is a fundamental concept and a part of almost all kinds of activities, and it is an interdisciplinary field of study. Among the most important contributing disciplines are philosophy, biology, knowledge organization, psychology, statistics and mathematics.  Definitions  Frederick Suppe Suppe, Frederick. 1989. \\"Classification\\". In Erik Barnouw ed., International encyclopedia of communications. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, vol. 1, 292-296 distinguished two senses of classification: a broad meaning, which he called \\"conceptual classification\\" and a narrow meaning, which he called \\"systematic classification\\". About conceptual classification Suppe (1989, 292) wrote: \\"Classification is intrinsic to the use of language, hence to most if not all communication. Whenever we use nominative phrases we are classifying the designated subject as being importantly similar to other entities bearing the same designation; that is, we classify them together. Similarly the use of predicative phrases classifies actions or properties as being of a particular kind. We call this conceptual classification, since it refers to the classification involved in conceptualizing our experiences and surroundings\\" About systematic classification Suppe (1989, 292) wrote: \\"A second, narrower sense of classification is the systematic classification involved in the design and utilization of taxonomic schemes such as the biological classification of animals and plants by genus and species. During the history of science and philosophy many definitions and theories of classification have been put forward. A chronological list of definitions appears in Birger (2017).Hjørland, Birger. 2017. \\"Classification\\". ISKO Encyclopedia of Philosophy https://www.isko.org/cyclo/classification#app  Basic units  Hull (1998)Hull, David L. 1998. “Taxonomy.” In Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Edward Craig. London: Routledge 9: 272-76. suggested \\"The fundamental elements of any classification are its theoretical commitments, basic units and the criteria for ordering these basic units into a classification\\". The basic units in a classification system are classes (or sometimes clades or related terms, cf. Hjørland (2017, Section 2) . There is a widespread opinion in knowledge organization and related fields that such classes corresponds to concepts. We can, for example, classify ‘waterfowls’ into the classes “ducks”, “geese”, and “swans”; we can also say, however, that the concept “waterfowl” is a generic broader term in relation to the concepts “ducks”, “geese”, and “swans”. This example demonstrates the close relationship between classification theory and concept theory. A main opponent of concepts as units is Barry Smith (cf. Smith 2004).Smith, Barry. 2004. “Beyond Concepts: Ontology as Reality Representation”. In Proceedings of FOIS 2004. International Conference on Formal Ontology and Information Systems, Turin, 4–6 November 2004, edited by Achille C. Varzi and Laure Vieu. Amsterdam: IOS Press. https://philpapers.org/archive/SMIBCO Arp, Smith and Spear (2015, 5ff)Arp, Robert, Barry Smith and Andrew D Spear. 2015. Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. discuss ontologies and criticize the conceptualist understanding. The book writes (7): “The code assigned to France, for example, is ISO 3166 – 2:FR and the code is assigned to France itself — to the country that is otherwise referred to as Frankreich or Ranska. It is not assigned to the concept of France (whatever that might be).” Smith's alternative to concepts as units is based on a realist orientation, when scientists make successful claims about the types of entities that exist in reality, they are referring to objectively existing entities which realist philosophers call universals or natural kinds. Smith's main argument - with which many followers of the concept theory agree - seems to be that classes cannot be determined by introspective methods, but must be based on scientific and scholarly research. Whether units are called concepts or universals, the problem is to decide when a thing (say a \\"blackbird\\") should be considered a natural class. In the case of blackbirds, for example, recent DNA analysis have reconsidered the concept (or universal) \\"blackbird\\" and found that what was formerly considered one species (with subspecies) are in reality many different species, which just have chosen similar characteristics to adopt to their ecological niches (Fjeldså 2013, 141).Fjeldså, Jon. 2013. “Avian Classification in Flux”. In Handbook of the Birds of the World. Special volume 17 Barcelona: Lynx Edicions, 77-146 + references 493-501. An important argument for considering concepts the basis of classification is that concepts are subject to change and that they changes when scientific revolutions occur. Our concepts of many birds, for example, have changed with recent development in DNA analysis and the influence of the cladistic paradigm - and have demanded new classifications. Smith's example of France demands an explanation. First, France is not a general concept, but an individual concept. Next, the legal definition of France is determined by the conventions that France has made with other countries. It is still a concept, however, as Leclercq (1978) demonstrates with the corresponding concept Europe.Leclercq, H. 1978. \\"Europe: Term for many Concepts. International Classification 5, no. 3: 156-162 Hull (1998) continued: \\"Two fundamentally different sorts of classification are those that reflect structural organization and those that are systematically related to historical development.\\" What is referred to is that in biological classification the anatomical traits of organisms is one kind of classification, the classification in relation to the evolution of species is another (in the section below, we expand these two fundamental sorts of classification to four). Hull adds that in biological classification, evolution supplies the theoretical orientation.  Methods of classification  Ereshefsky (2000)Ereshefsky, Marc. 2000. The Poverty of the Linnaean Hierarchy: A Philosophical Study of Biological Taxonomy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. presented and discussed three general philosophical schools of classification: \\"essentialism, cluster analysis, and historical classification. Essentialism sorts entities according to their essential natures. Cluster analysis divides entities into groups whose members share a cluster of similar traits, though none of those traits are essential. The historical approach classifies entities according, to their causal relations rather than their intrinsic qualitative features.\\" These three categories may, however, be considered parts of broader philosophies. Four main approaches to classification may be distinguished: (1) logical and rationalist approaches including \\"essentialism\\"; (2) empiricist approaches including cluster analysis (It is important to notice that empiricism is not the same as empirical study, but a certain ideal of doing empirical studies. With the exception of the logical approaches they all are based on empirical studies, but are basing their studies on different philosophical principles). (3) Historical and hermeneutical approaches including Ereshefsky's \\"historical classification\\" and (4) Pragmatic, functionalist and teleological approaches (not covered by Ereshefsky). In addition there are combined approaches (e.g., the so-called evolutionary taxonomy\\", which mixes historical and empiricist principles).  Logical and rationalist approaches  * Logical divisionParry, William T. and Edward A. Hacker. 1991. Aristotelian logic. New York, NY: State University of New York Press, pp. 136-137 (top-down classification or downward classification) is an approach that divides a class into subclasses and then divide subclasses into their subclasses, and so on, which finally forms a tree of classes. The root of the tree is the original class, and the leaves of the tree are the final classes. Plato advocated a method based on dichotomy, which was rejected by Aristotle and replaced by the method of definitions based on genus, species, and specific difference.Pellegrin, Pierre. 1986. Aristotle's Classification of Animals: Biology and the Conceptual Unity of the Aristotelian Corpus. Translated by Anthony Preus. Berkeley: University of California Press. The method of facet analysis (cf., faceted classification) is primarily based on logical division.Mills, Jack. 2004. \\"Faceted classification and logical division in information retrieval\\". Library Trends, 52(3), 541-570. This approach tends to classify according to \\"essential\\" characteristics, a widely discussed and criticized concept (cf.,essentialism). These methods may overall be related to the rationalist theory of knowledge.  Empiricist approaches  \\"Empiricism alone is not enough: a healthy advance in taxonomy depends on a sound theoretical foundation\\" (Mayr 1968, 548)Mayer, Ernst. 1968. \\"Theory of Biological Classification\\". Nature 220, no. 5167: 545-8. https://doi.org/10.1038/220545a0 * Phenetics or Numerical taxonomySokal , Robert R. and Peter H. A. Sneath 1963 . Principles of Numerical Taxonomy. San Francisco : W. H. Freeman and Company . is by contrast bottom-up classification, where the starting point is a set of items or individuals, which are classified by putting those with shared characteristics as members of a narrow class and proceeding upward. Numerical taxonomy is an approach based solely on observable, measurable similarities and differences of the things to be classified. Classification is based on overall similarity: The elements that are most alike in most attributes are classified together. But it is based on statistics, and therefore does not fulfill the criteria of logical division (e.g. to produce classes, that are mutually exclusive and jointly coextensive with the class they divide). Some people will argue that this is not classification/taxonomy at all, but such an argument must consider the definitions of classification (see above). These methods may overall be related to the empiricist theory of knowledge.  Historical and hermeneutical approaches  * Genealogical classificationGnoli, Claudio. 2018. \\"Genealogical classification\\". In ISKO Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization https://www.isko.org/cyclo/genealogical is classification of items according to their common heritage. This must also be done on the basis of some empirical characteristics, but these characteristics are developed by the theory of evolution. Charles Darwin'sDarwin, Charles. 1859. On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. London: J. Murray. main contribution to classification theory of not just his claim \\"... all true classification is genealogical ...\\" but that he provided operational guidance for classification (cf., Richard 2016, pp. 90–92).Richards, Richard A. (2016). Biological Classification: A Philosophical Introduction. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Genealogical classification is not restricted to biology, but is also much used in, for example, classification of languages, and may be considered a general approach to classification.\\" These methods may overall be related to the historicist theory of knowledge. One of the main schools of historical classification is cladistics, which is today dominant in biological taxonomy, but also applied to other domains. The historical and hermeneutical approaches is not restricted to the development of the object of classification (e.g., animal species) but is also concerned with the subject of classification (the classifiers) and their embeddedness in scientific traditions and other human cultures.  Pragmatic, functionalist and teleological approaches  * Pragmatic classification (and functionalBonaccorsi, Andres, Gualtiero Fantoni, Riccardo Apreda and Donata Gabelloni. 2019. “Functional Patent Classification”.

Cham, Switzerland : Springer, Chapter 40: 983-1003. and teleological classification) is the classification of items which emphasis the goals, purposes, consequences,Bowker, Geoffrey C. and Susan Leigh Star. 1999. Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. interests, values and politics of classification. It is, for example, classifying animals into wild animals, pests, domesticated animals and pets. Also kitchenware (tools, utensils, appliances, dishes, and cookware used in food preparation, or the serving of food) is an example of a classification which is not based on any of the above-mentioned three methods, but clearly on pragmatic or functional criteria. Bonaccorsi et al. (2019) is about the general theory of functional classification and applications of this approach for patent classification.Bonaccorsi, Andres, Gualtiero Fantoni, Riccardo Apreda and Donata Gabelloni. 2019. “Functional Patent Classification”. In Springer Handbook of Science and Technology Indicators, eds. Wolfgang Glänzel, Henk F. Moed, Ulrich Schmoch and Mike Thelwall. Cham, Switzerland : Springer, Chapter 40: 983-1003. Although the examples may suggest that pragmatic classifications are primitive compared to established scientific classifications, it must be considered in relation to the pragmatic and critical theory of knowledge, which consider all knowledge as influences by interests (cf., Barnes 1977).Barnes, Barry. 1977. Interests and the Growth of Knowledge. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ridley (1986,191)Ridley, Mark. 1986. Evolution and Classification: The Reformation of Cladism. London: Longman. wrote: \\"teleological classification. Classification of groups by their shared purposes, or functions, in life - where purpose can be identified with adaptation. An imperfectly worked-out, occasionally suggested, theoretically possible principle of classification that differs from the two main such principles, phenetic and phylogenetic classification\\".  Synonyms and near-synonyms for the term classification One or more of the following terms are by some authors considered synonyms for classification while other authors have suggested various ways of differentiating these terms. * Concept/conceptualization (see further ISKO Encyclopedia: Concept/conceptualization) * Categorization is, for example, mostly used by cognitive psychologists for what other call classification. Much of the contents of the Wikipedia article categorization is equally true for classification (see further ISKO Encyclopedia: Categorization) * Ordering (see further ISKO Encyclopedia: Ordering) * Taxonomy was first used in biology, but the term has spread to other domains. There may only be historical reasons that, for example, the periodic table is called a classification rather than a taxonomy (see further ISKO Encyclopedia: Taxonomy) * Typology (see further ISKO Encyclopedia: Typology) * Division (e.g., logical division) (see further ISKO Encyclopedia: Division)  Examples of important classification systems = The periodic table  Is the classification of the chemical elements which is in particular associated with Dmitri Mendeleev (cf., History of the periodic table). Hubert Feger (2001, 1967–1968;Feger, Hubert. 2001. Classification: Conceptions in the social sciences. In Smelser, Neil J. and Baltes, Paul B. eds., International encyclopedia of the social and behavioral sciences. New York: Elsevier, pp. 1966-73. numbered listing added) wrote about it: A well-known, still used, and expanding classification is Mendelejew's Table of Elements. It can be viewed as a prototype of all taxonomies in that it satisfies the following evaluative criteria: # Theoretical foundation: A theory determines the classes and their order. # Objectivity: The elements can be observed and classified by anybody familiar with the table of elements. # Completeness: All elements find a unique place in the system, and the system implies a list of all possible elements. # Simplicity: Only a small amount of information is used to establish the system and identify an object. # Predictions: The values of variables not used for classification can be predicted (number of electrons and atomic weight), as well as the existence of relations and of objects hitherto unobserved. Thus, the validity of the classification system itself becomes testable. Bursten (2020)Bursten, Julia, R. S. 2020. \\"Introduction\\". In Perspectives on Classification in Synthetic Sciences: Unnatural Kinds, ed. Julia R. S. Bursten. London: Routledge wrote, however \\"Hepler-Smith, a historian of chemistry, and I, a philosopher whose work often draws on chemistry, found common ground in a shared frustration with our disciplines’ emphases on the chemical elements as the stereotypical example of a natural kind. The frustration we shared was that while the elements did display many hallmarks of paradigmatic kindhood, elements were not the kinds of kinds that generated interesting challenges for classification in chemistry, nor even were they the kinds of kinds that occupied much contemporary critical chemical thought. Compounds, complexes, reaction pathways, substrates, solutions – these were the kinds of the chemistry laboratory, and rarely if ever did they slot neatly into taxonomies in the orderly manner of classification suggested by the Periodic Table of Elements. A focus on the rational and historical basis of the development of the Periodic Table had made the received view of chemical classification appear far more pristine, and far less interesting, than either of us believed it to be.\\"  The Linnaean taxonomy  Is the particular form of biological classification (taxonomy) set up by Carl Linnaeus, as set forth in his Systema Naturae (1735) and subsequent works. A major discussion in the scientific literature is whether a system that was constructed before Charles Darwin's theory of evolution can still be fruitful and reflect the development of life.

Astronomy's Three Kingdom System  Is a classification of celestial objects suggested by Steven J. Dick (2013Dick, Steven J. 2013. Discovery and Classification in Astronomy: Controversy and Consensus. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. and 2019Dick, Steven J. 2019. Classifying the Cosmos: How We Can Make Sense of the Celestial Landscape. New York: Springer.). This system classify all celestial objects in 82 classes of objects. The top categories are the three kingdoms: \\"Kingdom of the Planets\\", \\"Kingdom of the Stars\\" and \\"Kingdom of the Galaxies\\". Each kingdom is divided to a number of families and subfamilies and further subdivided to the 82 classes. The system can be seen here: https://www.isko.org/cyclo/3ks#2 Astronomy is a fine example on how Kuhn's (1962)Kuhn, Thomas S. 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. theory of scientific revolutions (or paradigm shifts) influences classification. For example: * Paradigm one: Ptolemaic astronomers might learn the concepts “star” and “planet” by having the Sun, the Moon, and Mars pointed out as instances of the concept “planet” and some fixed stars as instances of the concept “star.” * Paradigm two: Copernicans might learn the concepts “star,” “planet,” and “satellites” by having Mars and Jupiter pointed out as instances of the concept “planet,” the Moon as an instance of the concept “satellite,” and the Sun and some fixed stars as instances of the concept “star.” Thus, the concepts “star,” “planet,” and “satellite” got a new meaning and astronomy got a new classification of celestial bodies.  Hornbostel-Sachs Classification of Musical Instruments  Is a system of musical instrument classification devised by Erich Moritz von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs, and first published in 1914.Hornbostel, Erich M. von and Curt Sachs. 1914. “Systematik der Musikinstrumente: Ein Versuch”. Zeitschrift für Ethnologie: Organ der Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte 46: 553-590. In the original classification, the top categories are: * Idiophones: instruments that rely on the body of the instrument to create and resonate sound. * Membranophones: instruments that have a membrane that is stretched over a structure, often wood or metal, and struck or rubbed to produce a sound. The subcategories are largely determined by the shape of the structure that the membrane is stretched over. * Chordophone: Instruments that use vibrating strings, which are most commonly stretched across a metal or wooden structure, to create sound. * Aerophones Instruments that require air passing through, or across, them to create sound. Most commonly constructed of wood or metal. A fifth top category, * Electrophones: Instruments that require electricity to be amplified and heard. This group was added by Sachs in 1940. Each top category is subdivided and Hornbostel-Sachs is a very comprehensive classification of musical instruments with wide applications. In Wikipedia, for example, all musical instruments are organized according to this classification. For an introduction to the system see Lee (2020).Lee, Deborah. 2020. “Hornbostel-Sachs Classification of musical instruments”. Knowledge Organization 47, no. 1: 72-91. Also available in ISKO Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization, eds. Birger Hjørland and Claudio Gnoli, http://www.isko.org/cyclo/hornbostel In opposition to, for example, the astronomical and biological classifications presented above, the Hornbostel- Sachs classification seems very little influenced by research in musicology and organology. It is based on huge collections of musical instruments, but seems rather as a system imposed upon the universe of instruments than as a system with organic connections to scholarly theory. It may therefore be interpreted as a system based on logical division and rationalist philosophy.

Carl Linnaeus is often recognized as the first scholar to clearly have differentiated \\"artificial\\" and \\"natural\\" classificationsMüller-Wille, Staffan. 2007. \\"Collection and collation: Theory and practice of Linnaean botany\\". Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38, no. 3: 541-562. Müller-Wille, Staffan. 2013. \\"Systems and how Linnaeus looked at them in retrospect\\". Annals of Science 3: 305-317. A natural classification is one, using Plato's metaphor, that is “carving nature at its joints” (Plato c.370 BC)Plato. c.370 BC. Phaedrus. (Translated by Alexander Nehamas and Paul Woodruff eds.). Cambridge, MA: Hackett Publishing Co, Inc., 1995. Although Linnaeus considered natural classification the ideal, he recognized that his own system (at least partly) represented an artificial classification. John Stuart Mill explained the artificial nature of the Linnaean classification and suggested the following definition of a natural classification: \\"The Linnæan arrangement answers the purpose of making us think together of all those kinds of plants, which possess the same number of stamens and pistils; but to think of them in that manner is of little use, since we seldom have anything to affirm in common of the plants which have a given number of stamens and pistils (Mill 1872, 498). The ends of scientific classification are best answered, when the objects are formed into groups respecting which a greater number of general propositions can be made, and those propositions more important, than could be made respecting any other groups into which the same things could be distributed [...] A classification thus formed is properly scientific or philosophical, and is commonly called a Natural, in contradistinction to a Technical or Artificial, classification or arrangement (Mill 1872, 499)Mill, John Stuart. 1872.

Evolution and Classification: The Reformation of Cladism. London: Longman. provided the following definitions: * \\"artificial classification. The term (like its opposite, natural classification) has many meanings; in this book I have picked a phenetic meaning. A classificatory group will be defined by certain characters, called defining characters; in an artificial classification, the members of a group resemble one another in their defining characters (as they must, by definition) but not in their non- defining characters. With respect to the characters not used in the classification, the members of a group are uncorrelated. * \\"natural classification. Classificatory groups are defined by certain characters, called 'defining' characters; in a natural group, the members of the group resemble one another for non-defining characters as well as for the defining character. This is not the only meaning for what is perhaps the most variously used term in taxonomy ...

Philosophical Psychology 17, no. 1: 135-9 wrote: \\"The fact is, modern scientists classify atoms into elements based on proton number rather than anything else because it alone is the causally privileged factor [gold is atomic number 79 in the periodic table because it has 79 protons in its nucleus]. Thus nature itself has supplied the causal monistic essentialism.

His sentence is the harshest penalty ever given for a rape case in the country.  Life and work  Kopseng was born in Colombia, but was adopted as a five-year-old by a Norwegian couple in 1982. He grew up in the Oslo neighborhood of Grefsen. As an adult, Kopseng made his living as a dancer, and was well known in Oslo's dancing community. Among other things, he appeared on the NRK Super children's channel and in the TV 2 talent show Norske Talenter. He has also worked as a photographer and stripper, as well as disseminating artistics assignments on the internet.  Crimes  The first report against Kopseng came in July 2001, when he was 24 years old. In the years that followed, there were several other reports against him; some victims gave his real name to police, while others used his aliases 'Inferno' ( which he used as a stripper) and 'Julio Gonzalez' (which he used as a photographer). However, the police couldn't trace these names back to Kopseng, all the first six rape reports were dropped for lack of evidence. On April 25, 2013, Kopseng was convicted by the Oslo District Court for three rapes that had taken place in autumn 2008 and August 2009.Borgarting Court of Appeals Ruling on May 25, 2016 (LB-2015-39183) He was sentenced to four years imprisonment, two of which were suspended.Borgarting Court of Appeals Ruling on December 23, 2013 (LB-2013-87989) At the time, the court considered that there little danger of recidivism, and released him pending an appeal. In the summer of 2013, there was a new allegation against Kopseng, this time from a British woman who had spent the night with him through a CouchSurfing service. Her report was a turning point in the investigation, and after this, Kopseng was taken into custody. When his case was presented before the Court of Appeal, he was acquitted of a third charge, but convicted of two other rapes. While serving his sentence, he was tried in court again after he was accused of many rapes between 2001 and 2013.Oslo District Court Ruling on February 13, 2015 (14-069981MED-OTIR/03) After some media outlets and websites started to mention him by name and shared his pictures, referring to Kopseng as a potential serial rapist, more and more women began contacting the police to report their experiences with him. Many of these rapes took place in connection with his job as a mediator of artistic assignments. Julio would lure the victims with job offers for movies and music videos, drugging and raping them during the job interviews. Among his victims were a female colleague and his cohabitant. Kopseng was convicted on all charges before the Oslo District Court in February 2015, but appealed the verdict. The appeal case started in January 2016 before the Borgarting Court of Appeal, and by the end of it, he was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 10 years, the most severe penalty for a rape case in the country's history. In connection to the trial, the police referred to Kopseng as \\"Norway's most active serial rapist\\". In 2017, he was charged with raping two more women and convicted two years later, but no new sentence was imposed on him, as he was already serving the highest penalty available in the country.

He trained in Antwerp and later moved to the Dutch Republic where he worked in The Hague. He was active as a decorative painter of flowers for wall and ceiling decorations, often in collaboration with Mattheus Terwesten.Pieter Hardimé at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Hardimé was born in Antwerp as the son of Simon, a laborer originally from the French-speaking part of the Southern Netherlands, and a Flemish mother. He trained with his older brother Simon Hardimé who was a flower painter. Simon was himself a pupil of Jan Baptist de Crépu, a flower and fruit painter active in Antwerp.Simon Hardimé at the Netherlands Institute for Art History De Crépu was originally an officer in the Spanish service who had only become a painter later in life when he settled in Antwerp where he was celebrated as a flower painter.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1149 Still life of flowers in a glass vase Pieter Hardimé never registered as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. Instead he moved in 1697 to The Hague where he remained active for the rest of his life. By moving to the Dutch Republic Pieter followed in the footsteps of many of his fellow Antwerp artists who left their home country which was affected by frequent attacks and invasions by French troops.Reginald Howard Wilenski, Flemish Painters, 1430-1830, 1960, pp. 353-379 His brother Simon joined him in The Hague from 1697, allegedly to escape his creditors in Antwerp. Simon later moved to Breda where he received a commission to paint a chimney piece for the palace of William III of England.Jacob Campo Weyerman, De levens-beschryvingen der Nederlandsche konst- schilders en konst-schilderessen, Volume 3, Dordrecht, Ab. Blussé en Zoon, 1729–1769, pp. 245-248 Pieter joined in 1700 the Confrerie Pictura, a more or less academic society of artists founded in 1656 in The Hague. He received commissions from Baron van Smettau, the ambassador of the Prussian King Frederick I of Prussia. He painted many flower pieces for Huis Honselaarsdijk, the Prussian King's country house in the Dutch Republic. These works were so appreciated by the king that they were later shipped to his palace in Prussia.Jacob Campo Weyerman, De levens-beschryvingen der Nederlandsche konst- schilders en konst-schilderessen, Volume 4, Dordrecht, Ab. Blussé en Zoon, 1729–1769, pp. 371-375 He had other prominent patrons including the mayor of Rotterdam Willem van Hogendorp and his brother the treasurer for whom he made decorative paintings for their residences.Jan van Gool, De Nieuwe Schouburg der Nederlantsche kunstschilders en schilderessen: Waer in de Levens- en Kunstbedryven der tans levende en reets overleedene Schilders, die van Houbraken, noch eenig ander schryver, zyn aengeteekend, verhaelt worden, The Hague, 1750, pp. 418-423 Large flower still life Hardimé married in 1707 Adriana Lens, sister of at prelate at the St. Bernard's Abbey in Hemiksem near Antwerp. He also received commissions from the Abbey for four large flower paintings representing the four seasons. After the Flemish painter Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger left The Hague, Hardimé became the favourite collaborator of the decorative painter Mattheus Terwesten. The artists often worked together on decorations of residences in The Hague. The count of Wassenaar was one of his patrons and commissioned him to make decorative paintings in his palatial home in Voorhout. After the death of his first wife with whom he had three children, he contracted a second marriage with a Miss Bruinestein, with whom he had no children.Jean Baptiste Descamps, La vie des peintres flamands, allemands et hollandois, avec des portraits: Gravés en taille douce, Volume 4, pp. 195-196 He is said to have become melancholic towards the end of his career as a result of a drop in demand for his fruit and flower pieces and decorative paintings. He died in The Hague where his death was recorded on in September 1748. Works Hardimé was a painter of still lives with flowers. These works were often chimney and doorway pieces which were placed over mantelpieces or door mantels as decoration.Ken Hall, Still life with flowers in a basket by Pieter Hardimé at Christchurch Art Gallery Flemish still life painting at the end of the 17th century showed a preference for decorative effect over naturalistic representation.Sam Segal, A Flowery Past: A Survey of Dutch and Flemish Flower Painting from 1600 Until the Present : Gallery P. de Boer, Amsterdam, March 13 – April 11, 1982, Noordbrabants Museum, 's-Hertogenbosch, April 29 – May 30, 1982, Gallery P. de Boer, 198, pp. 59–60Attributed to Pieter Hardimé, Vase of Flowers and Insects at the Cheltenham Art Gallery & Museum The trend was initiated by contemporary Flemish artists Jan Baptist Bosschaert and Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger and was also followed by Pieter's brother Simon as well as Pieter Casteels III. Hardimé created many works showing flower bouquets in large stone vases or arranged in the form of garlands around vases or garden ornaments. The vases were often depicted in outdoor settings with figures. After Mattheus Terwesten's regular collaborator Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger left The Hague in 1732, Pieter Hardimé and Terwesten worked together on decorative projects catering to the taste of the wealthy citizens of The Hague.C.J.A., Wansink, 'De decoratieve schilderkunst van Mattheus Terwesten, een Haagse meester uit de achttiende eeuw', Oud Holland 104 (1990), p. 270-291196 ReferencesExternal links Category:1677 births Category:1748 deaths Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:18th-century painters from the Southern Netherlands Category:Flower artists ","title":"Pieter Hardimé"},{"id":"65079238","text":"John Auld (21 January 1914 - 1996) was a British painter.

Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Claywood is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

History In the early 1990s father Nektarios Moulatsiotis was having trouble keeping up the camping areas that were in the monastery. Along with Xristodoulos, they decided to create a rock band named \\"Paparokades\\" so they could bring the popularity of the camping areas of the monastery once had. Members of the band included Giannis Papanikolaou, Xristofors, Father Moulatsiotis, and 2 other priests. The first song of the band was \\"I Learnt To Live Freely\\" which was sang by Papanikolaou and was a resistance message to people, in order for them to leave the system and learn to live freely in villages. The appearance of the band was pretty controversial for the Church of Greece as what these priests did was apparently \\"too anarchist\\". However the song gave popularity to the camping areas of the monastery and the songs continued with the next one being \\"The Microchip\\" which was about the microchip that was going to be mandatory in the future and the mark of the beast. The next song was called \\"Babylon\\" which was about the Fall of Babylon, after that Moulatsiotis and his team of priests went in ANT1 and said that the September 11 attacks were caused by demons who drove the planes towards the Twin towers. They claimed that there were no passengers or terrorists but that was regarded by the Channel as \\"Extreme\\". Paparokades made many other Christian rock and heavy metal songs until they decided to try songs with neoclassic/retro-like music. Songs with that music included: \\"What Has This World For Me?\\", \\"My Friend I'm Not Okay\\", \\"I Love You Greece\\", \\"The World Changes\\" and the \\"Against Your Order\\". The band was very popular until 2006 where the Greek government announced that a Biometric ID will become mandatory by the end of 2011, as people thought that was the number of the beast, people started violently protesting against the Biometric ID, these protestings included a farmer who was also protesting to intentionally get in his panel truck and collide with a van that was delivering Biometric IDs to the factories that were going to develop them, the reason this farmer did that was to stop the IDs from getting developed. That was somehow traced back to the band, so Paparokades received a lawsuit. This resulting in them disbanding. Papanikolaou became a rock singer in Diviner some years later. Despite this the camping areas still continue and are open even today.

It follows the inner workings of the campaign against the tour, and captures scenes of violent conflict between police and protesters. It is a significant work of activist and indigenous filmmaking, and of New Zealand filmmaking in general. Background New Zealand’s All-Blacks and South Africa’s Springboks have been frequent rugby rivals since 1921. The Springbok team had been the targets of protests over the last couple decades as a response to South African apartheid. The protests that met the 1981 tour were some of the most volatile in New Zealand history. It is said the campaign split the country between pro-tour and anti-tour, not least because of rugby's place in the country's national identity. The documentary takes a decisively anti-tour perspective, pointing the conversation about South African apartheid towards racial discrimination practiced in New Zealand. Production history Mita began producing the film as a 25-minute documentary for TVNZ, although its sensitive politics would necessitate the completion of the film independently. The film was created on a $41,000 budget contributed to by the New Zealand Film Commission, the Arts Council of New Zealand, and the National Catholic Commission. Fifteen camera operators and thirteen sound recordists are credited for the finished film, though Mita also used family members in the crew. They worked without pay, and often in dangerous circumstances. The editing process lasted two years, complicated by the various types of film stock used, the refusal of television networks to lend footage, and the need to protect the negatives from being seized by police as evidence. Mita complained of police harassment as they regularly visited her house on this pretence. Release history Patu! premiered at the 1983 Wellington Film Festival to a standing ovation. A shorter 83-minute version had further screenings at international film festivals. It was not shown on New Zealand television until the 10th anniversary of the tour in 1991. Reception and legacy Patu! has been acclaimed as a historical document and as a cinematic polemic. It has been called one of New Zealand's most important documentaries. Along with Canadian Abenaki Alanis Obomsawin’s films like 1984’s Incident at Restigouche and Mita’s earlier 1980 film Bastion Point: Day 507, Patu! is an early example of indigenous female filmmaking. The film has met with criticism for depicting the events solely from the perspective of the protesters, and accusations of bias and partisanship. Mita has responded “The Paheka bias in all things recorded in Aotearoa was never questioned... Yes, Patu! has a Māori perspective, but it does not override the mass mobilisation of New Zealand's white middle class, neither does it take credit from those who rightly deserve it”. In 2012, the 1983 theatrical cut of Patu! and supporting materials were added to New Zealand’s national UNESCO Memory of the World register.

At the time of production in 2019, Best had lost all copies during a move from Hawaii to San Francisco years before and had been looking for any since then, which he had told the show's producers. As part of their research, the production team searched online, including contacting the LGBTQ Video Game Archive, to seek out footage and copies. During post-production, the producers were contacted by the (Gay Museum) in Berlin, who had a copy that they were able to share with the producers, who after working with it, returned it to Best; this was noted briefly in the episode and expanded up in news reports the day of the series' release.

Life  Musa Mirmammad oglu Abdullayev was born on November 27, 1927 in Gizilagaj village of Masalli region in an intellectual family. His English and Russian were fluent even since the high school. The fact that he took lesson of English from Zinin, a prominent German physician of the time, living in the village of Slavyanka in Gadabay district was a great stimulus for him to understand events more deeply and an important condition for the radiance of his talent as a translator. When he was a schoolboy, his father Mirmammad Abdullayev moved to Baku with his family due to civil service. After graduating from high school with honors, he graduated from the treatment and prevention faculty of the Azerbaijan State Medical Institute, as well as the English language faculty of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages (present Azerbaijan University of Languages) From 1958 he worked at the Azerbaijan Scientific Research Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, studied the blood clotting system. In 1963-66 he worked as a scientific secretary at the Azerbaijan State Medical Institute, defended his PhD and doctoral dissertations for ten years, and obtained the academic title of professor. (1967–68) In 1967 he published a monograph: ”A number of issues of blood clotting in the norm and pathology.”,\\"Changes in the fibrinolytic activity of blood in surgical patients with various interventions.” Collection of scientific papers Azerbaijan Research Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Baku, 1962. Pp. 87-91The state of the coagulation system and fibrinolytic activity of the blood in patients with splenomegaly of various etiology. “Surgery”, No. 2, 1962. pp. 3-8. With this monograph, the prominent hematologist laid the foundation of the scientific theory of blood clotting. This monograph attracted the attention of hematologists of the former USSR. The invention contained in this monograph has been approved in the 25th April 1967 issue of the Medichinskaya Gazeta, published in the USSR. Innovative scientist Musa Abdullayev, who attracted the attention of hematologists abroad, was invited to the 12th International Conference of Hematologists held in 1969 – to the Federal Republic of Germany, but was not admitted to the international conference by the former USSR government. Despite his acquittal in 1956 for his political activities in ”Lightning”(İldırım),“Qırmızı terror”a boyun əyməyən azadlıq aşiqi. “Xalq” qəzeti 10 iyun 2020, http://xalqqazeti.com/az/news/44987Novruzda oxunan sürgün hökmü: https://www.smartnews.az/v/novruzda-oxunan-sürgün-hökmü the prominent scientist was invited to international scientific conferences held by foreign countries, but the Soviet regime blocked him each time. Although these people, including Musa Abdullayev, were acquitted, the Soviet government was still afraid of their political views. In 1967, an invitation from Austria was also banned. In fact, the young scientist at the time boldly said without hiding the reason:Invitation from the Federal Republic of Germany \\\\- ”I am well known in foreign countries, but unfortunately, political circles do not want to let me there.” By the article \\"Study of the hemostatic properties of Ekmolin\\", published in 1964, the researcher-scientist introduced the use of a new drug in medical science to prevent thromboembolic complications to the wider medical community. Until then, heparin was used in the medical world to prevent thromboembolic complications. In some cases, procaine sulfate was used to remove heparin from the body. Namely, Professor Musa Abdullayev was the first to use ekmolin instead of procaine sulfate. Until then, ekmolin was used by professors Yermolov and Valentinskaya in the treatment of viral influenza. Musa Abdullayev, on the other hand, discovered a new feature of ekmolin to reduce the effects of heparin. According to this discovery, the scientist conducted 32 experiments on 10 dogs. Ekmolin has been shown to act as a procaine sulfate. It is interesting that in 1969, Mustafa Topchubashov, a full member of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, world-famous scientist and politician, mentioned the name his student in the article ”Outstanding Surgeon“ dedicated to the 60th anniversary of Fuad Efendiyev in the ”Communist“ newspaper. Musa Abdullayev worked at the Republican Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion since 1958; in 1970-79 he was the head of the second department of propaedeutics of internal diseases of the Azerbaijan State Medical Institute. Prominent hematologist Musa Abdullayev, while leading the second department of propaedeutics of internal diseases of the Medical Institute, implemented the method of cordial defibrillation in 1974–75, innovated in the history of medical science in Azerbaijan. Professor Musa Abdullayev wrote the first two-volume English-Azerbaijani medical dictionary in 1979. The incurable blows inflicted on the human destiny by the Stalin regime, the terrible years of exile, from time to time endangered the health of every member of the ”Lightning“, including Musa Abdullayev. The eminent scientist of his time was such a selfless scientist in the field of medical science that the research work he wrote with his innate thinking is still on the agenda today. Musa Abdullayev laid the foundation of hundreds of scientific theories and textbooks with his articles. The fact that the cold, cruel death did not give an opportunity to the self-sacrifice of science deprived Musa Abdullayev of many scientific inventions and fundamental works. The untimely death of Musa Abdullayev, subjected to the repression because of his political activity in the name of independent Azerbaijan, suffered much as a result of torments in exile for the sake of his nation and homeland, but lived an unbreakable, unshakable life as a citizen, is not only the loss of a family. The premature death of a scientist distinguished by his outstanding discoveries is a great and irreplaceable loss for Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani medical science and for the history of Azerbaijani translation. Prominent scientist Musa Abdullayev died on August 8, 1979 at the age of 51 in Baku. He was married. He has 4 children and grandchildren. He spoke English, Russian, Persian and Arabic.

The prominent scientist studied the epidemiology of hemophilia, electron microscopy of platelets, the role of calcium in the process of blood clotting, donation issues, etc. conducted scientific research on other topics presenting great scientific importance. His scientific paper presented to the attention of the general medical community at the International Congress against Cancer held in 1962, concerning the problems of blood clotting process caused detailed discussion and was accepted as a product of a deep research in this field. Proceedings of the VII CongressThe 7th Congress of the International Society of Hematology. Rome, 1958. Translation of materials from English into Russian. of the International Society of Hematologists, held in Rome, Italy on September 18, 1958, were translated from English into Russian by Musa Abdullayev. The editor of the translation was corresponding member of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, doctor of medical sciences, professor Fuad Afendiyev. 3 articles of M.Abdullayev were included in the materials of the first conference held in 1960 between the Transcaucasian Institutes of Hematologists and Blood Transfusion. In the first article called ”The coagulation system in the blood of patients with various splenomegaly and the state of its fibrogenic activity“ prepared in collaboration with Professors F. Afendiyev and A. Akhundov. This article was devoted to the study of a very important topic for that period. The research work ”Changes in the blood clotting system during surgery” has not lost its relevance today in terms of important innovations for medical science. Musa Abdullayev's scientific articles were regularly published in the journal “Hematology and blood transfusion” published in the USSR. One of his articles, entitled ”Changes in the blood clotting system during blood donation in donors” attracted attention at the level of the former Soviet Union. Musa Abdullayev's article \\"Modified dried-sterile thrombin at the Azerbaijan Institute of blood transfusion and its application in the clinic\\" co-authored with Professor Huseynov is also a fundamental research work in terms of its style and innovation spirite. For this reason, the results of the scientific invention of the eminent scientist are still used in the medical world today for diseases of the nose, ears and throat. In 1962, he defended his thesis on “Fibrinolytic activity of the blood system and changes in coagulation factors in patients before and after surgery” under the supervision of corresponding member of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, Honored Scientist Fuad Efendiyev. In 1967, Musa Abdullayev defended his doctoral thesis on “Blood clotting in normal and some pathological conditions.” 4 doctoral and 8 Ph.D. thesis were defended under the supervision of Professor Musa Abdullayev. In 1972, the selfless scientist wrote a book for medical students called ”Clinical Interpretation of Laboratory Tests.” Today, the book is used as a basic scientific basis for research by students of the Medical University. In 1972, Musa Abdullayev has presented his scientific book \\"Military Field Therapy\\" to the medical world together with Abbasov I.T. The scientific material he wrote in 1972 is still available to the medical community. For many years, Musa Abdullayev contributed to the history of medical science in Azerbaijan by publishing his scientific articles in the \\"Azerbaijan Medical Journal\\", especially his research as a blood specialist. Professor Musa Abdullayev wrote the section of \\"Blood Diseases\\" for the manual”Clinical Surgery”. The services of Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor Musa Abdullayev as a scientist are still important in the history of Azerbaijani medical science in the formation and special place of dozens of medical specialists in the world of science. The suffering scientist Musa Abdullayev with his short but meaningful life left a perfect, rich scientific legacy for present and future generations.

The two EPO decisions are under appeal, as of August 2020. United Kingdom Similar applications were filed by Thaler to the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office on 17 October and 7 November 2018. The Office asked Thaler to file statements of inventorship and of right of grant to a patent (Patent Form 7) in respect of each invention within 16 months of the filing date. Thaler filed those forms naming DABUS as the inventor and explaining in some detail why he believed that machines should be regarded as inventors in the circumstances. His application was rejected on the grounds that: (1) naming a machine as inventor did not meet the requirements of the Patents Act 1977; and (2) the IPO was not satisfied as to the manner in which Thaler had acquired rights that would otherwise vest in the inventor. Thaler was not satisfied with the decision and asked for a hearing before an official known as the \\"hearing officer\\".

Erik Magnussen (14 May 1884 – 24 February 1961) was a Danish silversmith and designer. He was from 1925 to 1939 based in the United States, initially as artistic director of the Gorham Manufacturing Company in New York City and later with his own workshop in first Chicago and then Los Angeles. Life=Early life and education Magnussen was born on 14 May 1884 in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, the son of author and translator Johannes Julius Claudi Magnussen and Hedvig Charlotte Claudine Sommer. In 1898–1901, he was a sculptor's apprentice in his uncle's art gallery Winkel & Magnussen. He also studied sculpting under Copenhagen-based Norwegian sculptor Stephan Sinding, and silver chasing under the silversmith Viggo Hansen (1859–1930). In 1907–09, he worked as a chaser in Otto Rohloff's workshop at the Unterrichtsanstalt des königlichen Kunstgewerbe-Museums (Royal School and Museum of Applied Arts) in Berlin, Germany. Career in Denmark, 1908–25 Back in Copenhagen, Magnussen opened his own jewelry and silver workshop, where he designed items in a style similar to that of Georg Jensen as well as various types of silver items. He closed the shop in 1912 and accepted a post as Director of the Department of Arts and Crafts at Bing & Grøndahl, where he designed porcelains decorated with gold and silver. In 1913, he left Bing & Grøndahl to once again open his own silver workshop. In 1922 one of his designs won the grand prize at thIndependence Centenary International Exposition in Rio de Janeiro. In 1921–25, Magnussen worked for the P. Ipsens Enke terra cotta factory. He continued to make jewelry, and in 1922 one of his designs won the grand prize at the International Exposition in Rio de Janeiro. America, 1925–39 In 1925, Magnussen emigrated to the United States and set up a studio in New York City. That same year, the Gorham Manufacturing Company hired him as its artistic director to reinvigorate its line of household silver goods. Initially, he designed Neoclassical items with decorative elements such as domes, vines, talons, tulips, and fluting. In 1927, he attracted considerable attention by designing a Cubist-inspired tea set. However, Magnussen's work for Gorham began just as the Great Depression set in, and his work sold poorly. He left Gorham in 1929 to work for the New York branch of the German firm August Dingeldein & Sohm. In 1932, he moved to Chicago to set up his own workshop. He moved it to Los Angeles in 1933 and closed it in 1939. Career in Denmark, 19391951 In 1939, Magnussen returned to Denmark. Faced with a scarcity of materials after the unset of World War II, he mainly created jewelry. He married Esther Margrethe Franck (13 October 1895 – 27 June 1992) a daughter of metalsmith and later rentier Frederik Wilhelm F. and Cathrine Frederikke Jensen, on 13 September 1941 in Skovshoved. Works Cubist tea set, 1927 Magnussen's early jewelry is designed in the style locally known as Skønvirke. They are with their use of insects and semi-precious stones inspired by René Lalique. His work from the years in America are designed in the Art Deco style with inspiration from cubism and skyscraper architecture.

Consequently, anticipating future customer needs and behaviors constitutes a challenge when developing future product portfolios. This is especially relevant for industries with long planning cycles because these industries have to develop value propositions today for the customers of tomorrow. However, this involves dealing with many unknowns e.g. future everyday life or future consumption patterns. This is why, customer foresight starts with analyzing the consumer needs, values and motivations of today. Methods in the field of customer research that can be applied at this stage are e.g. qualitative and quantitative surveys, behavioral observation and experience, ethnographic research, cultural analysis or value and motivation research. On the basis of these consumer insights, transformations and change dynamics are projected into the future. As a result, a space of possibility is defined. In order to then understand future realities, customer and foresight research are combined. Foresight tools to apply can for example be scenario planning, trend research and science fiction. However, also quantitative methods such as time series analysis can be used. Their application allows for understanding dynamics of change and projecting the envisioned developments into the future. The following graphic visualizes and classifies the approach in the sweet spot of customer and foresight research. Classification of customer foresight at the intersection of customer and foresight Research (Eller, Hofmann & Schwarz 2020) At the intersection of customer and foresight research, it is then crucial to understand the interaction of customers with drivers of change or future realities. As customer foresight relies a lot on insight generation through interactions, a systematic selection of study participants is of great importance. Through interacting with Trend Receivers or other study participants, insights are generated which are then analyzed. The following section provides a more detailed description of the stages of typical customer foresight projects.  Stages of customer foresight projects  The customer foresight journey typically starts with the identification of relevant business needs by e.g. analyzing market dynamics, visions and objectives and value propositions. In a second step, change dynamics are analyzed and research materials on future scenarios are collected e.g. by applying scenario planning, doing desk research, roadmapping and gathering inputs from science fiction (for an example of a multi-method study approach in the field of customer foresight see Hahn et al. 2016). Then, the most suitable dialogue partners and project participants are selected by applying pyramiding techniques, screening, scouting or broadcasting. The interviews can be organized in role-playing, workshop formats or in-depth interviews. Based on these inputs, practical implications are identified which are then integrated by decision makers through strategy workshops, backtesting or design thinking sprints. As a consequence, customer foresight insights are transferred into business value.  Mass customer foresight  As the name already alludes, mass customer foresight is about insights that are valid for the mass market or the average customer and are representative for societies or markets. In contrast to customer foresight, it uses large scale, quantitative tools to examine future consumer behavior in a representative way. The following figure classifies the concept with regard to customer insight and foresight. Classification of mass customer foresight (workshop of Goethe University and the Foresight Academy) The concept was developed by Goethe University and the Foresight Academy as an extension to the customer foresight concept. The latter is often criticized as too elitist because the application of the e.g. Trend Receiver methodology by its definition implies that the subjects do not embody the average consumer. Since the customer base of many companies consists of the broad mass of people it can be important to enrich insights generated in the course of interactions with a selection of customers with the view of a representative sample. Consequently, the importance of these insights for corporate strategy formulation can be increased. An example for such a mass customer foresight study is the research project which was carried out in the course of the collaboration between Goethe University and the Foresight Academy. Here, such a quantitative study was designed and carried out within Germany, China and the United States. The research project built on the results of a Trend Receiver study that examined the question “How do we want to live in 10 years?” within six areas of life: living, leisure and work; health and nutrition, consumption and finance; communication; identity and expression as well as community and society. The qualitative insights generated through the interviews were used as the hypotheses to validate within the joint quantitative survey. As a consequence, empirical research can approve or reject projections made and increase the validity of the qualitative results and their importance for corporate strategy and decision making. While customer foresight itself is quite a new research field, mass customer foresight is even more new and still rather in the experimental stages. However, it will be interesting to observe its further development in theory and practice.

History The street was first established in the Roman Eboracum period, running parallel to and outside the city's south-western wall. At the time, the city's bridge over the River Ouse lay at its northern end. Excavations have located remains of a 1st- century grain warehouse on the south-west side of the street. By 980, the first Ouse Bridge had been constructed, further south, but the street remained important, traffic reaching the bridge from the north along it. The street was first recorded in about 1150, as \\"Cuningstrete\\", the King's Street. The use of \\"street\\" rather than \\"gate\\" suggests that the name dates from the Anglian period, and two coin hoards from the period were found in the 1760s. By 1150, the road was considered to run all the way from Ousegate to what is now St Helen's Square, the part which is now Spurriergate sometimes distinguished as \\"Little Coney Street\\", while Lendal was regarded as a northern extension, named Old Coney Street. St Martin le Grand, on the street, was recorded in the Domesday Book, and unlike most streets in York, Coney Street was divided between parishes: St Martin Le Grand; St Michael, Spurriergate; and St Helen, Stonegate. In the 12th-century, Coney Street was known for its Jewish population, with its residents including Aaron of York, considered the wealthiest Jew in England. It also housed York's synagogue. In 1190, the Jews of York were massacred, and many of their houses were burned down. In 1279, after the Jews had been expelled from England, Roger Basy and John Sampson were granted their former property on Coney Street. In 1308, Coney Street was described as the most important street in York. In 1335, a row of houses were built in the churchyard of St Martin; almost entirely rebuilt on several occasions, the last remains survived until 1958. In 1396, the Gild of St Christopher Maison Dieu almshouse was constructed on the street, and in 1459, York Guildhall was built next to it, at the northern end of the street. York Mansion House was built in front of it in 1725, and in 1782 the area in front of it was cleared to create St Helen's Square. Four of the locations at which the historic York Mystery Plays were performed lay the street. The Bull Inn was built in the 15th-century, which from 1459 was the only place in the city at which foreigners could stay. The George Inn opened on the street in 1614, becoming the city's most prominent coaching inn. Soon after, the Black Swan was built on the other side of the street, a large inn which could stable 130 horses. In 1691, the Bagnio Turkish bath was built just off the street. This was later converted into St Peter's School, and then a printing house where the first edition of Tristram Shandy was published. View north on Coney Street During the 18th-century, the street became known for banking. It also became the home of the York Courant newspaper, and later, of the Yorkshire Evening Post and Yorkshire Herald. The street's continuing importance led to it being widened in 1769, and again in 1841. During the 19th-century, the street became lined with shops, noted businesses including the House of Bewlay tobacconist, Burgin's perfumery, and the Leak & Thorp department store. Clothing shops were particularly prominent, including Iles, R. W. Anderson & Sons, and, later, Burton's. There were also major grocers' stores: Borders' and Lipton's. In 1924, The Leopard Inn was demolished, and replaced by the Leopard Arcade, a small shopping centre, but it was destroyed by bombing in 1942. The Ebor Hall entertainment venue was built just off the street in the 1860s, while there were also several pubs. In 1915, the Picture House cinema opened, while in 2000, the City Screen cinema opened. The Willow Cafe was another long-running entertainment venue, opening in the 1950s and surviving until the 2010s, at which time it was a nightclub. During the 20th-century, an increasing number of the shops were taken over by national chains. Boots opened in 1919, Woolworth's in 1924, and W. H. Smith's in 1920. The Black Swan was eventually demolished and replaced by a large shop, which became BHS. Despite the closure of several shops in the 2010s, the street remains home to a mix of High Street shops and cafes, while numerous buskers perform throughout the day. The musician Chris Helme was discovered while busking on the street. Architecture and layout 18-22 Coney Street The street runs north-west from the junction of Spurriergate and Market Street, to St Helen's Square. New Street leads off the north-east side of the street, as does a snickelway leading to the Judge's Court hotel, while several snickelways lead from the south-west side down to the River Ouse, including Blanshard's Lane, and paths leading to City Screen. While the street retains numerous historic buildings, most have had their street-level frontage rebuilt during the 20th-century. Notable buildings on the north-east side include the 15th-century 16-22 Coney Street, 24 Coney Street which was built about 1600 but includes part of an earlier building, the early-18th century Judge's Court hotel, and 36-40 Coney Street, dating from the 1780s. 48 Coney Street was built for Boots, in a mock timber framed style, while the former Burtons at 52 Coney Street is in the art deco style. On the south-west side lie the early 18th-century 3–7, 9, and 13 Coney Street, the last incorporating part of a Mediaeval wall by the Ouse. 15 Coney Street is the former York Courant office, built around 1800, while 17 Coney Street includes one surviving column from the George Inn. 29 and 31 Coney Street dates from about 1600, while 33 and 39 Coney Street both date from the 18th-century.

Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 4  Yacht  The vessel was built in the shipyards of Ramage and Ferguson Ltd of Leith, near Edinburgh, having been designed by the engineering firm of Cox and King of London. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 2 She was launched on behalf of Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria under the name of Rovenska on 27 March 1904. However, the vessel herself was invoiced to his wife, the Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria. The name was derived from Rovenska on the Adriatic island of Lošinj off the coast of what is now Croatia, a favourite spot of the archduke and the site of his luxurious villa. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 2 She sailed under the flag of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1909 but was then sold to Sir Max Waechter Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 4 for £26,000, at which point she sailed under the British flag while still retaining her original name. During this ownership it is likely that she undertook two main voyages: one to the Adriatic and the Black Sea and another to the North Sea.Berryman, Ron (May 2012) \\"Sir Max Waechter's European Unity\\", Journal of the Richmond Local History Society, Nr 33 In 1914 she was sold to the industrialist, Gustav HF Pratt. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 4 Service during the Great War= Patrol Vessel  At the outbreak of the war, the vessel was requisitioned by the British government and converted into a patrol and escort ship for the Royal Navy as part of the Channel Fleet, plying between England and the French ports of Best and Saint Malo. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 4 At the end of the war, she was decommissioned and auctioned at Southampton, coming into the hands of Guglielmo Marconi in 1919 for £21,000. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 4 Service with Marconi= Conversion to luxurious seaborne laboratory  Now owned by Marconi, the vessel sailed from London in July 1919. Off the coast of Portugal Marconi startled the operators at a coast station with transmissions of music from gramophone records. The yacht arrived at Naples in mid-August, then transferring to La Spezia, where she was converted for service as a laboratory. Marconi's original intention was to rename his yacht Scintilla ('Spark') but it was felt this would prove too difficult to pronounce in English. The yacht was accordingly renamed Elettra and was entered into the Italian Registry of Shipping on 27 October 1921 with subsequent ratification under the Italian flag on 21 December. Modifications at La Spezia included increasing the height of the masts in order to rig the various wireless aerials that would be required. It was also arranged that Marconi's private cabin would give directly onto the laboratory.Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 6 On deck and aft of the laboratory was a dining room with space at table for 12-14 diners. Further aft still was a large and well- appointed saloon complete with a piano. The vessel soon became famous and known in Italian as il nave dei miracoli ('the ship of miracles'). While sailing across the Bay of Biscay in April 1920 an interesting 'first' was established - guests danced in the saloon to broadcast music coming from the ballroom of the Savoy Hotel in London. Later, on 15 June, the voice of the famous soprano Nellie Melba was heard at a distance of 2000 miles during a broadcast from the Marconi transmitting station at Chelmsford in England.Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 7 Everything is radio on Marconi's yacht - a \\"personal dance\\" on board the palatial vessel while on the trip to Albany Showing Josephine Young of Riverside, Conn., and J.W. Elwood of New York, LCCN96512883 The luxurious accommodation was deemed necessary to impress distinguished guests - these would later include King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and King George V of England. In September 1920 another guest on board was the Italian poet and nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio. Elettra had put in at the port of Fiume (now Rijeka) in an unofficial attempt by Marconi to persuade D'Annunzio to drop his demands for that city to become an independent state. Marconi allowed him to use the ship's transmitter, whereupon D'Annunzio made an impassioned speech to the world in which he urged Italy to annexe the territory. On 31 March 1930 Benito Mussolini visited the yacht when she was lying off Fiumicino. This was followed with another visit in June 1930 when she was off Ostia. Mussolini, who was greatly interested in long distance wireless telegraphy and telephony, expressed a wish to be put through to London and communication was made via the wireless station in Somerset that was equipped with beam aerials (beam antenna). He had hoped to speak to Sir Basil Blackett but the latter was unavailable and so he conversed for a while with an operator at the station, commenting later on the clarity of the speech. Crew With a crew of some 30, Elettra was able to sail long distances without needing to refuel; in 1922 she first crossed the Atlantic to New York, surviving the effects of a severe storm. An important crew member was the radio officer, Adelmo Landini, who was known as the 'marconista', the Italian term equivalent to 'sparks' in English.The familiar term for a radio officer in the British Merchant Navy. Landini, who sailed with Marconi from 1927-1931, had been a wireless operator decorated for gallantry in the army during the Great War. He was not only a skilled Morse code operator but also a self-taught expert in wireless technology. As such he not only assumed the duties of the yacht's radio officer but also assisted Marconi with his experiments. Indeed Landini later became an experimenter and inventor in his own right, registering seven patents for his inventions. In 1938/39, he registered a patent concerning the bouncing of radio waves off the surface of the moon - a phenomenon that he had first become aware of while serving on Elettra. In 1931 while the vessel was en route from Cannes to Santa Margherita Ligure, Landini lost his balance during bad weather and brushed against a high tension cable. Following this accident he left Elettra and did not return to work with Marconi. Marconi's reflections on the advantages of a seaborne laboratory Without Elettra it would have been impossible to carry out my experiments in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic; I would not have been able to continue and develop my research into short wave transmissions. With my seaborne laboratory – unique in the world – I have been able to realise my dreams. For example, how to beam a radio signal and to use radio for navigational purposes. This yacht has not only made me independent, but also freed me from distractions and the curiosity of others. I have been able to work at any time of the night and day and move around in a way that would have been quite impossible on dry land.  Wireless experiments from the vessel Of particular importance were the experiments conducted from Elettra in the Gulf of Tigullio – communication being established with a coast station in one of the Gualine towers on the Sestri Levante peninsula. In honour of this, the Gulf of Tigullio was renamed the Gulf of Marconi on the official Italian navy chart.Information from the article in the Italian Wikipedia that appears without a citation. Marconi continued to experiment, concentrating his efforts on the short wave spectrum. In April 1923, he sailed from Falmouth to the Cape Verde Islands and monitored signals from the station at Poldhu in England, which was operating on a wavelength of 97 metres with a power of 1 Kw. It was noted that the signals disappeared at a distance of 2594 km but at night-time they could be heard at 4632 km.Goodwin, WD (1995) \\"One Hundred Years of Maritime Radio\\", Brown, Son & Ferguson, Glasgow. p.43 In 1924 thanks to an improved aerial at Poldhu, two-way communication from the yacht was established from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic on a wavelength of 32 metres. The same experiment also proved successful, with solid signals throughout the day, when Elettra was in port at Beirut. Another successful contact was made from the yacht (in the Mediterranean) to Sydney enabling Marconi to speak to the managing director of the Amalgamated Wireless Company. These experiments using beamed transmissions convinced the British government of the viability of shortwave (as opposed to the current use of longwave) and resulted in a contract with Marconi's company for a communications network linking stations in the British Empire with London. In 1926 a two-way communications link was officially inaugurated between Britain and Canada. Elettra was in British waters in September 1925 when, during a run from Dover to Southampton, Marconi demonstrated the use of wireless for direction finding. On a wavelength of 6.09 metres, bearings were taken on a transmitter on the lighthouse at South Foreland. The receiving aerial on the yacht was a 2-foot length of wire suspended at one end of the bridge and reception was possible at a distance of up to 100 miles. In 1929 the wireless equipment aboard Elettra, which had been fitted in 1923, was replaced by technicians from Marconi's company with an updated and improved installation. Early in 1930 wireless telephony contact was made with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) in Sydney and on 26 March of that year, Marconi achieved publicity worldwide when, by pressing a Morse key on his yacht in Genoa harbour, he remotely switched on the lights in Sydney for the opening of the World Exhibition. Further experiments were conducted off the Italian coast in the 1930s on a wavelength of 57 cm using wireless telephony. In 1931 Elettra completed a round-the-world voyage. On 30 July 1934, with a 60 cm transmitting beacon on shore and a receiver in the chartroom, the windows of which had been covered, he successfully navigated the yacht between two buoys off Santa Margherita Ligure. Goodwin, p. 62 A four-way contact was established in November 1936 - the stations concerned being Elettra (at Santa Margherita Ligure), New York and two aircraft flying over that city. Elettra sailed the seas of the world until, with the death of Marconi on 27 July 1937, she was acquired by the Italian Ministry of Communications for the sum of 820,000 lire.Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 16 Fire on board Elettra On 25 November 1936, there was a fire on the yacht while she was lying in the harbour at Civitavecchia near Rome. It was fortunate that Elettra was not at sea at the time. Firemen were soon on the spot and after several hours were able to extinguish the flames. Damage to the yacht was slight. Destruction during service with the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) during World War Two  At the outbreak of the Second World War the ship was moved to Trieste and in September 1943, following the Armistice of Cassibile, was requisitioned by the Germans and armed with five machine guns, one of 15mm and four of 20mm, mounted in twin turrets. Now part of the Kriegsmarine, she was brought into service first with the designation G-107 and then as NA-6. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 18 However, between September 1943 and the end of November of the same year, Professor Mario Picotti obtained permission from the Germans to dismantle and remove all of Marconi's wireless equipment. This was carried away in 19 large packing cases and deposited safely in the vaults of the Castello di san Giusto in Trieste. The equipment remained here until the end of 1947 before coming into the hands of the Milan Museum of Science and Technology where it was reassembled by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The vessel sailed from Trieste on 28 December 1943 for a patrol along the Dalmatian coast. On 21 January 1944 she arrived off Diklo, near Zadar. The following morning she was spotted and attacked by allied fighter-bombers. The captain decided to run her aground before she sank. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 18  Fate of Elettra after World War Two  With the signing of the peace treaty, the wreck became the property of Yugoslavia and it was not until 1959 that authorisation was given for a survey to examine the possibility of recovery and return. The necessary permission was granted thanks to intervention by Josip Broz Tito following efforts by the then Foreign Minister, Antonio Segni, who would later become President of Italy.Information from the article in the Italian Wikipedia that appears without a citation. The ship was returned to Italy in 1962 having been re- floated and towed to the shipyard at San Rocco di Muggia near Trieste. However, the planned restoration stalled and the hulk was still languishing in the bay five years later. Castelli, Cherini, Gellner p. 24 The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications prepared a study for a reconstruction but the high cost resulted in a postponement and eventual cancellation of the project. Locations of salvaged sections of the dismembered yacht With all hope of a restoration lost it was decided that the remains of Elettra would be cut up and parts distributed around Italy to places that had been associated with Marconi and his work. The breaking up of the yacht started in April 1977, the largest section recovered being the bow, which now sits in the middle of a roundabout in the AREA Science Park at Trieste. The locations of this and of other sections, including the whereabouts of Marconi's wireless equipment, are detailed on pages 33-43 of the publication Marconi e lo yacht Elettra'.

","title":"Elettra (ship 1904)"},{"id":"65081129","text":"Pirqoi ben Baboi (), also written Pirqoi ben Babui, was a Babylonian scholar of the Talmud who lived sometime in the 8th-9th century. He is chiefly remembered for a polemical letter he wrote, addressed to all places in Afriqiya and Sfarad, but thought to be directed in particular to the Qeirwān Jewish community in Tunisia concerning the traditions of Eretz Israel. His writings have been called 'one of the most intriguing Babylonian Jewish texts to have survived the vicissitudes of history'. Biography The precise dates of his floruit are unknown, except that context suggests he lived around 800 CE. His unusual name Pirqoi seems to be a Persian personal name, with Jacob Nahum Epstein inferring from this hypothesis that he must have been born and raised in Babylonia. The alternative view, advanced by Louis Ginzberg is that he was a native of Eretz Israel who emigrated and settled in Babylonia to pursue his studies. The latter theory fits well with the fact of his familiarity with Palestinian usages and texts. He was a disciple of Rav(a)Abba/Rabah who had in turn sat at the feet of Yehudai Gaon, with some sources saying Pirquoi ben Baboi studied under both. He is associated with both the Sura and Pumbedita academies. Background After the Muslim conquest of Iraq, Babylonian rabbis retained strong memories of their communal life under the Sasanian Empire. Politically, the entire Middle East had now come under unified Islamic rule but, like some Syrian Christian writers such as John of Fenek, Pirqoi ben Baboi evoked in exaggerated terms the pre- existing geopolitical division as still marking a cultural rift between the tranquil life of Jews from Sasanian times onward and Jewish communities to the west under Byzantine authority, characterized by endemic persecutions. The ostensible difference was deployed to buttress Babylonian Jewry's claims to superiority over those in Palestine/Eretz Israel, whose legal customs were a result of persecution (minhagei shmad). Pirqoi ben Baboi would cite a verse from Daniel 7:5 'and three ribs were between his teeth' as prophetic of the sway which the evil empires of Greece and Rome (Edom) would subsequently exercise, to the detriment of proper Torah traditions, over communities to the west of Babylonia, taking the line to be an allusion to the fate of Harran, Nisibis and Adiabene. The Jewish communities in Babylonia, he falsely asserts by ignoring the evidence of the late Sasanian period, never suffered persecution. Work He became known for his Iggeret, according to Ginsberg the earliest extant halakhic work surviving from the Geonic period, an epistle to the Jews of Kairouan in Tunisia. This epistle, the first known example of its kind for advocating the dissemination of the Babylonian Talmud, dated to around 800/810 came to light from its discovery among the Geniza records. It contains a polemical attack on what he regarded as the ignorant customs prevailing among Palestinian Jews of Eretz Israel (minhagei eretz yisrael) at that time, beliefs and practices which had, he argued, spread to major centres of Talmudic learning in North Africa, such as Kairouan, from which they radiated out in turn further west to Spain. This iggeret, a virulent broadside against the Land of Israel/Palestine, which was held in high reverence in Jewish communities, and the whole Palestinian rabbinical tradition, might have struck its readership as scandalous. Though widely distributed, did not appear to have much effect on the community it addressed, since Palestinian influences remained strong there centuries later, as one can see from Sherira Gaon 's Iggeret to Kairouan and in the work of his son Hai Gaon. However the arguments made are echoed in broader diatribes and defenses of piyyut in much later times. The claim to a superior authority in religious matters was buttressed by the claim that the Babylonian academies, namely the Torah sages according to the Seder Olam Rabbah, departed, with Jeconiah, to Babylon 12 years prior to the Siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586, and only after their safety was secured was permission granted to destroy Jerusalem and its Temple. The exile itself was, he argued, an 'act of charity (tzedakah)' by God. The Babylonian yeshivot conserved the strength (gevurah) of the Jewish contingent of troops (gibborim) who had formed part of the earlier evacuation, so that the Babylonian scholars, heirs to this exile of the strong, were themselves warriors (gibborei) of Torah. In terms of his rhetoric of persuasion, Pirqoi ben Baboi's mode of thought evinces three simple assumptions: * What distinguishes Babylonian Judaism from its Palestinian counterpart is that the former never experienced persecution (shemad), whereas it was continuous with the latter. * The persecutions in Palestine broke the transmission of the Oral Torah there. * Therefore, the authentic Judaic tradition is conserved in Babylon. That in Palestine is unreliable. His driving aspiration was to impose the halakhic hegemony of the Babylonian academies over all Jewish communities, and thereby undermine the diaspora's attachment to Eretz Israel. Only the legal code as laid down in the Babylonian Talmud was a reliable basis for practice of the oral law throughout the world. Any custom (minhag) which disagreed with the Babylonian rabbinical canon he considered a \\"custom of apostasy\\", which he imagined Edom/Rome had imposed on the Jews of Palestine. It has been suspected, in this last regard, that the virulence of his censure stems from anxiety over the rise of the Karaites – some of whose positions had been inflected by Palestinian usage- who refused to accept the oral teachings encoded in Babylonian rabbinical texts. The Karaites, for example, considered fasting on the Sabbath laudable, just as Italian Jews since late antiquity allowed the practice on particular occasions. In the latter instance, this may reflect the persistence of a residue of popular Palestinian traditions of piety notwithstanding strictures against the practice issued by authoritative rabbis. Pirqoi ben Baboi frowned on any such deviation from what was established Babylonian practice. These perceived abuses extended to the scrolls of the Torah produced in Palestine, which, he stated, were written on vellum prepared by Gentiles in disregard for halakhic stipulations on their proper production. A fragment of Pirqoi ben Baboi's appears to contain, in the form of a quotation, the earliest extant reference to Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer, and plays some role in arguments for dating that work. The historical context of Pirqoi's critique In ancient Greece, a distinction developed between súngramma (σύγγραμμα) and hupómnēma (ὑπόμνημα), namely an authorized copy of a book and the private notes made on it. With the rise of Hellenism, this discrimination influenced Palestinian rabbis when they in turn drew a sharp line of demarcation between the Tanakh scriptural corpus, and extra-biblical oral teachings, ascribing greater importance to this Oral Torah than to the written Torah. According to one source, the Pesikta Rabbati, God turned town Moses' request at Sinai that the Oral Torah be written down: he did so to avoid a repetition of what would happen with the Old Testament, i.e. be translated into Greek and allow gentiles other than Jews to proclaim themselves 'children of Israel'. For much of the Geonic period, the Talmud was conserved primarily in oral transmission. In his letter, Pirqoi ben Baboi remonstrated with the Kairouan community arguing that it was not sufficient to cite written texts in laying down Jewish law. The position of Yehudai Gaon was that applied halakhic rulings could not be made simply by citing halakha from the Tanakh, Mishna, or Talmud. The prescriptive authority of a Jewish law could only be vouchsafed if a living master ruled that it was known to be implemented in practice (halakhah le- ma'aseh). Written aide-mémoires from the oral tradition (nushaot), or from a megilat setarim (sequestered scroll), were devoid of cultural authority since they were not authorized, as were girsaot, by a master of the oral law linked to the chain of tradition. Pirqoi ben Baboi's construal of the relevant sugya in the Talmud is, however, arguably unique in inferring from the conditions set for making halakhah le-ma'aseh the idea that the only valid method for transmitting the Oral Torah must be itself oral. The problem with Palestinian rabbis, in his view, was that in eliciting passages inscribed from the Mishna and Talmud, some of them 'hidden' (genuzin), each imposed their personal interpretation upon them. The Babylonian practice exemplified by Yehudai Gaon was that Talmud legal teachings are validated only of they can be corroborated by living masters familiar with non-textual traditions, the chain of oral judgments, consensus and customary usage. The Greek distinction whose impact is at work in these controversies was transmitted in a similar form to Islamic culture, where, after the establishment of the Qur'an text, there arose fierce opposition, particularly in areas best known for having by heart these stories, such as Basra and Kufa, to the inscription of the accompanying oral traditions. Scholars like Ibn Sa'd (784-845) vehemently argued that Muslims ought not to repeat what Islamic jurists conceived to be the theological error in Judaism, of writing down the Mathnā (i.e. the Mishna). Such practices would only invest teachers with an authority comparable to the foundational text of the Qur'an itself. This hostility to the written, as opposed to oral, recording of what Muhammad was remembered as having said, namely the ḥadīth, prevailed under the Umayyad Caliphate until Umar 11 (717-720) ordered that an official compendium (tadwīn) of ḥadīth be made. Human memory was frail, and notes (atraf) had been made, but like nushaot, these were to remain secreted away. Gregor Schoeler. analyzing fulminations impugning the Umayyad dynasty's legitimacy, correlated the genre hostile to the inscription of hadith with the fall of the Umayyads. They had broken a powerful taboo. The scholars frequently vindicated the Abbasid Caliphate which followed, and the new dynasty had empowered rule by Islamic jurists (fuqahā). Extrapolating from this, Talya Fishman wonders whether there is not some broad connection between this phenomenon in Islam and the remonstrations made by Yehudai Gaon and, later, Pirqoi ben Baboi. Jews outside of Eretz Israel called their Palestinian brethren Shami or 'Damascenes', and the Babylonian school's hostility to Palestinian traditions might be embedded in a broader cultural battle, in which the Abbasids found themselves in rivalry with the Syro-Palestinian communities, in Umayyad territories to their west, around the Mediterranean. Prayer Pirqoi ben Baboi was particularly concerned with prayer orthodoxy. He quotes his teacher Yehudai Gaon for an halakhic ban on non-Talmudic blessings, stating that unless a blessing is in the Talmud it may not be uttered, or modified even in a single letter. The Palestinian Jewish creation of piyyut came under intense fire as the geonic scholars strove to exercise their hegemony in terms of a correct halakhically defined liturgy. This remonstrance by the circle of Yehudai Gaon was shrugged off by the community in Palestine with their traditional dismissal: minhag (custom) nullifies halakha (minhag mevattel halakhah: מנהג מבטל הלכה). Like Yehudai Gaon, he was opposed to the recitation of the Shema in the Kedushah. Historically this innovation arose when, Jacob Mann opined, Heraclius, breaking a promise he had made to the Jews, wrested sway over Palestine from the Sassanian Persians and their former Jewish allies, and proscribed recitation of the daily Tefillah and Shema. Since they were allowed only to congregate in their synagogues on the morning of the Sabbath to recite the Amidah and associated piyyutim, the Hazzan or precentor adopted the subterfuge of smuggling the banned prayer in, intoning the first and last lines of the Shema in such away as to slip by the eavesdropping of government officials monitoring the session. Pirqoi ben Baboi repeated his stance of Yehudai Gaon that the raison d'être for such a novel practice had vanished with the Muslim conquest of Palestine, and the overthrow of Byzantine rule. Therefore, it was necessary to remove the Shema from the kedushah of the Shacharit Amidah, since under Arab rule it was now possible to return to the normal prayer practices in place prior to Christian Byzantium rule. Pirqoi ben Baboi nonetheless did not require that the Shema be removed from the Mussaf Kedushah, a widespread Jewish ritual in Babylonia and one that also preserved an innovation made at a time of persecution.

Consisting of a tower reaching in height and a horizontal braking runout, Sky Screamer had an L-shaped appearance. It featured eight uniquely designed gondolas, each holding four riders. The gondolas used one set of wheels to go up the lift and down the drop (4 large wheels at each back corner), but used a different set in the transfer and loading and unloading area of the ride (smaller rollers located on the bottom of the gondola). Gondolas were lifted upward through a shaft in the tower's center by a lift chain. Once at the top, the gondola was disengaged from the lift chain and pushed forward into the drop position. The gondola was released into freefall following the sounding of a loud klaxon (which was audible throughout sections of the park and often lured visitors to the ride). A pair of guide rails ran downward along the outside of the tower before curving into the horizontal braking runout. The freefall drop into the horizontal curve applied a g-force of 4.5 on the riders. In late 1983, 50% more anti-rollback devices were installed. The additional anti-rollbacks were staggered on each side of the lift. These modifications were intended to improve stopping ability in wet conditions and were a response to a non-fatal accident on a similar ride at another park. In 1986, the ride's \\"G-Block\\" was moved farther down the horizontal braking runout. The end of \\"H-Block\\" was extended to the beginning of the station conveyors in 1994.

Most early paleontological research was the by- product of mineral exploration for the country's developing mining industry. The first scientifically described fossil from Thailand was that of the bivalve Posidonomya becheri siamensis from Ban Khuan Dinso in Phatthalung Province, made by F. R. Cowper Reed in 1920. Official cataloging of fossils began two years later, and received contributions by Western paleontologists and geologists. Systematic surveys and studies were later begun by Japanese researchers led by Teiichi Kobayashi, who published their findings on trilobites in Tarutao Island (the oldest fossils found in the country) in 1957. Over the following decades, Japanese and German researchers conducted paleontological research as part of geological surveys throughout the country. Dinosaur fossils were first discovered in the country in 1973, during uranium surveys in Phu Wiang (now in Wiang Kao District) in Khon Kaen Province, initiating a wave of dinosaur research by Thai and French academics and a rise in public interest in the field. Several new dinosaur species have since been described from several sites in the country's Northeast, and paleontology museums have been established. Continued research is undertaken mainly by the DMR and some universities, as well as other public and private institutions.  Thailand's first dinosaur discovery  Distal part of a left femur of a sauropod dinosaur regarded as the first dinosaur discovery of Thailand Beginning in 1970, the US Geological Survey conducted a mineral exploration in the Phu Wiang area of Khon Kaen province and discovered a type of uranium ore, coffinite, in association with copper ores, azurite and malachite. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later participated. Between 1975 and 1980, the Department of Mineral Resources conducted a detailed drilling program and in 1976 Sudham Yaemniyom, a geologist, discovered a piece of bone on a streambed, Huai Pratu Tima, which was later identified as a distal part of the left femur of a sauropod dinosaur,Ingavat, R., Janvier, R., and Taquet, P. (1978) Decouverte en Thailande d'une portion de femur de dinosaure sauropode (Saurischia, Reptilia). C.R. Soc.Geol.France 3: 140-141 regarded as the first dinosaur discovery of Thailand.  Expedition and research  Since 1976, the Department of Mineral Resources, together with the Thai-French Paleontological Project, investigated the dinosaurs in the Phu Wiang mountains. The project found many vertebrae, teeth, and dinosaur footprints mainly from sandstone of the Early Cretaceous Sao Khua Formation (about 130 million years old), including sauropod and theropod, with a wide range of sizes, from a hen up to a large dinosaur with about 15 meters long. These finds led Thai people to visit the dinosaur sites, and Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn visited Site 2 on 3 November 1989. She also revisited the site, viewing Site 3 and the Phu Wiang Dinosaur Museum, with the committees of the Prince Mahidol International Award, of the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation, on 25 October 2008.

The irredentist movement in Cambodia is aimed against the control by Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. Irredentist, official and unofficial Cambodian claims on territories viewed by Cambodians as having been under some form of Cambodian sovereignty, are rhetorically tied back to an accused expansionism.  History  Up until the establishment of the Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian states, the Khmer Empire was the major land power and a dominant force in mainland Southeast Asia. The territory of Cambodia encompassed most of what would be now Thailand, Laos, part of Myanmar and Southern Vietnam; in an extent, it encroached to even mainland Malaysia. However, subsequent problems and turmoils, as well as the rapid advance by the Vietnamese, Laotians and Thais brought Cambodia into its dark age, where Cambodia became a tool of neighboring imperialism. Among all, the Thais and the Vietnamese were seen to have done the most harm to Cambodia, causing significant physical traumas for the people of the nation. In order to survive, Cambodia came under a French protectorate, only to find itself being grouped within Vietnamese-dominated French Indochina, and with the French favoring Vietnamese instead of Cambodians. At the outbreak of the First Indochina War Khmer irredentism began to rise.https://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/myth_nationalism_and_genocide.pdf Nonetheless, it was not officially espoused until 1970 when Lon Nol overthrew the monarchy and replaced it with a Republic, where it became increasingly nationalistic and chauvinist, leading to the persecution and massacres of ethnic Vietnamese and Chams. The Khmer Rouge later inherited these nationalistic sentiments and conducted the infamous Cambodian Genocide.https://shs-encounters-cambodia.ird.fr/content/view/full/226084 Modern irredentism=Mekong Delta The Cambodians hold a significant amount of hostility to Vietnam with regard to their loss of the Mekong Delta to the Vietnamese in history, and the subsequent enforced Vietnamization and conflicts which Vietnam repeatedly occupied the country, French favoritism to the Vietnamese, and the lack of cultural commonalities with Vietnam being part of the Sinosphere while Cambodia belongs to the Indosphere; this often drew Cambodian nationalist sentiment with the desire to reclaim territory from Vietnam. Both Lon Nol and Pol Pot utilized this grievance in order to spread Cambodian irredentism which led to the genocide of ethnic Vietnamese. Currently, Cambodian irredentists still feel strongly attached to the region, and as a result, they believe it is a lost territory which should be returned to Cambodia. The expression of this sentiment has frequently ignited various protests, notably the 2013–2014 Cambodian protests, and Vietnam is frequently blamed for all of the turmoil and problems which occur within Cambodia, partly because Hun Sen is closely affiliated with Vietnam. This sentiment has sometimes driven Cambodia to forge close ties with China, a country which Vietnam has a strong feeling of enmity towards due to the fact that it was ruled by China for over one thousand years. In addition to the Mekong Delta, Cambodian nationalists seek to reclaim Phú Quốc, which Cambodians frequently call \\"Koh Trol\\", based on their belief that it was part of Cambodian territory before it was annexed by Vietnam, and it often attracts a number of Cambodian celebrities. Thailand While tensions with Thailand are now receiving lesser attention, nonetheless many Cambodians have a long standing hostility in regard to Thailand, due to most of Thailand used to be under Khmer control until the rise of Ayutthaya Kingdom, and subsequent conflicts which started the demise of Cambodia as a regional power and repeated Thai occupation of Cambodia.http://sisaket.go.th/ssis/papers/english/Khmerness%20and%20the%20Thai%20%91Other%92%20Violence,%20Discourse%20and%20Symbolism%20in%20the%202003%20Anti- Thai%20Riots%20in%20Cambodia.PDF Therefore, a strong anti-Thai sentiment developed in Cambodia as for the result, with many Cambodians believed that many of Thai cultural acquisition today was the work by Khmers, and that Thailand has been trying to steal Cambodian culture and custom.https://kyotoreview.org/issue-3-nations-and-stories/a-love-hate- relationship/https://www.expatden.com/thai/khmer-influence-in- thai/https://khamerlogue.wordpress.com/tag/siam-stole-khmer-culture-and-land/ Cambodia and Thailand also engaged in border disputes from 2008 to 2011 with regard to Preah Vihear Temple. Eventually, Cambodia acquired the temple following the dispute.https://casebook.icrc.org/case-study/cambodiathailand- border-conflict-around-temple-preah-vihear There is also Cambodian nationalist irredentism against Thailand with regard to Northern Khmer people, where Cambodians still see them part of Cambodian nation, and that northeastern Thailand should have been Cambodian. Laos Cambodian irredentists have objected the existence of Laos as an independent state and believed that Southern Laos should have been Cambodian territory. This has led to some sporadic tensions from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, Cambodia and Laos removed troops from the disputes area surrounding Stung Treng.

The temple was built in the 17th century by Jalim Giri Baba and his family, who belonged to the Goswami community of the village. Its administration was taken over from the descendants of Giri Baba by the gram panchayat () in 1977. Dedicated to the goddess Sikri, who is believed to be an incarnation of Durga, the temple attracts large gatherings of visitors during the biannual festival of Navaratri. During the Chaitra month of Navaratri, marking the beginning of a new year on the Hindu calendar, a large historical fair is organised for nine days. The fair was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic for the first time since 1918. There is a banyan tree on the temple premises from which more than 130 revolutionaries were hanged to death during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.  History  The Shri Mahamaya Devi Temple is located in the Sikri Khurd village on the periphery of Modinagar city, Ghaziabad district, Uttar Pradesh. It has been renovated many times but the exact date of construction of the original structure is unknown. However, according to the local belief, it is more than 400 years old, and before the construction of the temple, Jalim Giri Baba, a hermit mahant from the Goswami community, used to live here in his hut. As per this belief, Giri Baba experienced darśana (holy sight) of the goddess Durga here and she commanded him to build her temple at this location. He revealed his divine experience with the goddess to his family and community members, and the temple was subsequently established.  Hanging of revolutionaries in 1857  During the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the rule of the British East India Company, many revolutionaries took shelter in the basement of the temple. A Company officer, Douglas, had the temple searched and the rebels dragged out of the basement. He then ordered their executions by hanging from the ancient banyan tree situated on the temple premises. More than 130 people were hanged to death and around 30 were shot to death. The tree is still present and pilgrims pay their tribute to it in remembrance of the martyrs.  Administration  The temple was built by the Goswami community of Sikri village and its administration was handled by the descendants of Jalim Giri Baba, who still live in the village. In 1977, the pradhan () of the gram panchayat organised a separate temple management committee, and during that process also evicted the Goswami family and its administration from the temple. Before the takeover, all the offerings in the temple were deposited to the gram panchayat, including earnings from stallage related to the organisation's annual nine-day long fair and funds donated for the Goswami family's income.  Temple deity  The sanctum sanctorum, garbhagriha, of the temple houses the murti of the primary deity of the temple, the goddess Sikri, who is believed to be an incarnation of the goddess Durga. The devotees of Sikri offer chunari, coconut, and prasāda of cardamom in the temple in her reverence. Idols of other Hindu gods and goddesses are also installed in the temple, which is common in most Hindu temples. Animal sacrifice was a common practice in the temple until 1952 when some teachers of the village, including Aditya Goswami, Pandit Hari Dutt Ved, and their colleagues, protested against this ritual and had it banned. An akhand yagya () is held continuously for three days—the sixth, seventh, and eighth days of the Chaitra month—every year at the place that was earlier used for sacrificing the animals, usually goats and roosters. However, live goats and liquor are still offered to the goddess with a belief that it will please her.  Congregation  The temple attracts large numbers of devotees from Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Punjab. The Navaratri festivals in the months of Chaitra and Ashvin (Sharada) witness thousands of visitors attending the temple. Like other places of worship in the country, the temple was closed for visitors and its doors were sealed off by the district administration during the nationwide COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Its doors were reopened on 9 June 2020 in the presence of a tehsildar who was sent as the representative of the Sub- Divisional Magistrate, representatives of gram panchayat, and Ghaziabad Police officials. The temple mahant () Sunil Kumar performed a special puja in the beginning of the door-opening ceremony.  Navaratri fair  A large fair, the Devi Mela (), is organised by the temple administration during the nine days of the Navaratri festival of the Chaitra month. Chaitra marks the beginning of the Hindu new year and coincides with the months of March and April on the Gregorian calendar. The fair is inaugurated on the first day of Chaitra usually by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate by breaking a coconut, which is considered auspicious in Hinduism. The district administration constructs a temporary bus stand for pilgrims at the boundary of the village during the fair, and frequent bus service is operated from there to nearby cities and states. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Uttar Pradesh, the district administration was reluctant to permit the fair in 2020. A special meeting was held, attended by the Member of Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Modinagar Manju Shiwach, tehsildar Umakant Tiwari, and the representatives of gram panchayat on 21 March 2020. It was decided at the meeting that the fair would be cancelled for 2020 with the doors of the temple sealed to the public; however, priests would be allowed to carry on the daily rituals inside the temple. The last time the fair was not organised was during the 1918 flu pandemic in India, when then-mahant of the temple Swami Aditya Goswami decided to close the doors of the temple and postpone the fair to the next year.  Security during the festival  The temple is provided with security by Uttar Pradesh Police during all nine days of the Navratri festival, with senior officials of both police and district civil administration maintaining a continuous presence because of the large gathering that the temple attracts during these days. Sixteen surveillance cameras have been installed on the temple premises. Door-frame and hand-held metal detectors are used and a dog squad of the Ghaziabad police is deployed especially during the Navaratri fair.

Retrieved August 17, 2020. Schulz has taught at Parsons School of Design since 2000. Work and reception Schulz indicates that two foundational interests have structured her art: space and narrative. Influenced by philosophers exploring malleable conceptions of space and time, such as Gaston Bachelard, Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson and Elizabeth Grosz, her work conveys multiple, proliferating views and a cinema-like temporality.Sozanski, Edward J. Review, The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 8, 2009. Retrieved August 21, 2020. She draws on personal history, art and poetry, news events and collective experiences for imagery; her early work was more personally focused, while since the mid-2000s, she has linked the personal with public and geopolitical issues such as the nature of violence and hatred, tragedy, terrorism and war, and the environment. Schulz's drawings evolve intuitively, often beginning with ideas from reading, which she develops in sketchbooks before rendering small sections of an image at length, often without a predetermined plan. Her delicate charcoal drawing technique has been noted by New York Times critic Benjamin Genocchio, among others, for its close observation and painstaking detail, heightened level of finish, and control of the medium's capabilities.Wilson, Beth. \\"Drawn Together,\\" Chronogram, February 2008, p. 40–1. 2008.

Early paintings Charlotte Schulz, With head shorn she listens to the sleeper sleeping away the dream and dreaming the lives of an acquired wisdom, charcoal on paper, 17\\" x 14\\", 2000. Schulz's early oil paintings arose out of the dislocation she felt following her parents' divorce and move to the alien suburban sprawl and tropical life of Florida. These large works explore memories, charged emotions and relationship to place, using a recurrent, intimate metaphor of a house set in suburban landscapes to represent the human psyche. In an effort to break from a single perspective format, Schulz reshaped styles and spatial treatments of the past—drawing on sources from Cezanne, Cubism and Giorgio de Chirico to traditional Chinese landscape painting and the early Renaissance (e.g., Giotto)—to create personal, contemporary statements. They employ subtle shifts between maze-like interiors and suburban scenes to create fictionalized, cinema-like narratives, informed in part by her reading of Bachelard's phenomenological work The Poetics of Space. Curator Henry Geldzahler wrote that multi-view paintings like A Room of My Own suggest the complex ways we experience architecture through \\"an original amalgam of aspects of Futurism and American Surrealism.\\" Other critics compared Schulz's stairways leading nowhere, unexpected doors and dreamlike, tilted rooms—in that work and others, such as Persephone's House With a Chimney (1995)—to the psychological architectures of 18th-century Italian visionary Giovanni Battista Piranesi's fantastical Carceri prison etchings. Early drawings (1999–2005) In the late 1990s, Schulz moved to Boston (and subsequently, Brooklyn). Finding herself in a crowded urban setting, with less workspace, she turned to modest- sized, single-sheet drawings made in charcoal that, while still personal, were also informed by imagery drawn from poets such as Wallace Stevens and Robert Kelly, philosophy and psychology.Charlotte Schulz website. Early Drawings. Retrieved August 21, 2020. She relinquished the need to start with a structuring house image, instead taking an approach that upended seemingly fixed, opposed constructs like inside and outside, influenced by the fluid, non-Cartesian conception of space and events posited in Deleuze's The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque.Nahas, Dominique. \\"Timeless/Timeliness,\\" Timeless/Timeliness: Aljira Emerge 2003, Newark, NJ: Aljira: A Center for Contemporary Art, 2004.Larsen, Mernet. Dark Poets, Baltimore, MD: Maryland Institute College of Art, 2007. These ideas were compatible with her interest in portraying shifts in thought and emotion, mysterious and portentous narratives, and movement in time rather than static scenes; the resulting works, including her \\"Inside the Monad\\" series, synthesize landscape, architecture, interiors, objects and weather elements. Critic Dominique Nahas described such drawings (e.g., With head shorn, she listens to the sleeper sleeping away the dream and dreaming the lives of acquired wisdom, 2002), as delicately detailed, intensely private, charged vignettes and \\"incantatory revelations\\" that \\"suggest the flitting of intertwined memories.\\" Mature drawings (2005– ) Beginning in 2005, Schulz shifted to large-scale, intricate charcoal drawings composed of multiple sheets that she often tore, folded, bent and distressed, reshaping and disrupting the picture plane.Stein, Lynn and Daly Flanagan. 7: Out of this World, Nyack, NY: Rockland Center for the Arts, 2008. These black-and-white works drew on diverse imagery and extensive reading, and increasingly, linked personal experience to collective, often-traumatic experiences, such as 9-11, Hurricane Katrina, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. They employ a careful blending of charcoal and delicate erasure that interweaves vignettes of haunted landscapes and elegant interiors intruded upon by war and natural disasters amid the folded terrain, low relief and untouched voids of the paper.Kozul, Zeljka Himbele. Shift and Flow, Long Island City, NY: Dorsky Gallery, 2011. Charlotte Schulz, Traversing an Open Interior, charcoal and pastel on paper, 47\\" x 39\\" x 1\\", 2017–8. Schulz's surfaces function like screens onto which she projects and layers beliefs, emotions, and potential realities or parallel worlds to form purposefully disjointed narratives that suggest a contemporary psychological index; the language poetry-like titles she composes mirror the juxtaposition of visual elements. A 2010 Village Voice review describes her work as conveying complex moods moving between comfort and fear rather than clearly delineated narratives, and counts it among a \\"renaissance in the realm of the fantastical\\" for realist drawing. Formally, these later drawings explore tensions between real and illusionist space and the sculptural potential of paper, often taking on non-rectangular, object-like configurations that suggest physical, dynamic forces at play. Schulz created the eight-panel drawing The Maximum of All Possible Hate Is Realized and We Cleave to Our Screens as It Unfolds in That Disquieting Way (2005) in response to the 9/11 attacks.Charlotte Schulz website. The Maximum of All Possible Hate 2004-2005. Retrieved August 21, 2020. Its sheets are arranged on the wall like dominoes (or story panels) and depict incongruous imagery: an airplane flying through a room, everyday domestic elements, explosions, scenes of passage and escape, a sheep on a platform. John Parks of Drawing describes it as \\"a potent and thoughtful reflection on how public events intrude on and redefine our private lives, and conversely, how our private lives intrude on and redefine history,\\" also noting its ability to convey connections and correspondences unavailable to a simple linear narrative. In Schulz's shows \\"An Insufficiency in Our Screens\\" (Aldrich Museum, 2007; Mills College, 2008) and \\"The Uneven Intensities of Duration\\" (2010, Smack Mellon; Wake Forest), the softer blending and merging of imagery in her earlier work gave way to razor-sharp detail, maximum contrast, and more dramatic, disruptive folds in her surfaces.Charlotte Schulz website.

These individual and multi-sheet drawings feature abandoned landscapes shot through with billowing darkness and light, dislocated interiors, and unexpected juxtapositions of size (tiny figures, vast spaces), non-sequiturs, symbols and collective memory (e.g., Suspended in the Midst of a Flood the Past Carries Itself into a Current Location and Pressures a Rescue from Geographical Forces, 2010).Trummer, Thomas. \\"Look, look again,\\" Charlotte Schulz: An Insufficiency in Our Screens, Ridgefield, CT: The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, 2008.Sutton, Benjamin. \\"Labryrinths of the Eye,\\" The L Magazine, October 11, 2010.

Her \\"Territory of Significance\\" (2015–6), \\"Groundlessness\\" (2017–8) and \\"Voyage\\" (2018–9) series increasingly suggest maps, both through their irregular, continent-like shapes and mash-ups of deconstructed, varied terrains and settings spilling over and growing out of folds and bends in the paper.Voeller, Meagan. \\"Spatial engagement – 'Poetics of Space' at Dunedin Fine Art Center,\\" Creative Loafing, July 23, 2015.

He joined Su Jun in his rebellion against the Jin dynasty and after his death, continued to serve his son Su Yi. He would die in a last stand in 329 while leading remnants of Su Jun's rebels.  Life  The earliest mention of Han Huang is in 324, who followed Su Jun during Wang Dun's second insurrection against the Jin government. Wang Dun's forces were about to battle Su Jun's army at Qinhuai River during the night. Wang Dun believed that Su Jun and his men were tired due to marching long distances but just as the battle started, Han Huang flanked his troops and routed them.(敦遣峻兄說峻曰：「富貴可坐取，何為自來送死？」峻不從，遂率眾赴京師，頓于司徒故府。道遠行速，軍人疲困。沈充、錢鳳謀曰：「北軍新到，未堪攻戰，擊之必克。若復猶豫，後難犯也」賊於其夜度竹格渚，拔柵將戰，峻率其將韓晃于南塘橫截，大破之。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 In 326, the Later Zhao general Shi Cong (石聰) invaded Jin. The Jin court initially ignored Zu Yue's call for help when Cong attacked Shouchun but panicked when Junqiu (浚遒, in present-day Feidong County, Anhui) and Fuling (阜陵; in present-day Quanjiao County, Anhui) were invaded as well. Wang Dao was made Grand Marshal to stop him, but just before he could take action, Su Jun sent Han Huang to help Zu Yue repel Shi Cong. Han Huang defeated him and Shi Cong fled back to Zhao.(石勒將石聰攻壽陽，不克，遂侵逡遒、阜陵。加司徒王導大司馬、假黃鉞、都督中外征討諸軍事以禦之。歷陽太守蘇峻遣其將韓晃討石聰，走之。) Book of Jin, Volume 7 The following year, Su Jun and Zu Yue would rebel against Jin. Su Jun's first course of action was to capture Jin's food supply at Gushu (姑孰, in present-day Dangtu County, Anhui). Han Huang led Su Jun's other generals with him to capture it, and once they did, they marched to Cihu (慈湖, in present-day Jinjiazhung District, Anhui) where they killed the Prefect of Yuhu (于湖, in present-day Wuhu, Anhui), Tao Fu (陶馥) and General Who Spread Might Sima Liu (司馬流).(峻遣將韓晃、張健等襲姑孰，進逼慈湖，殺于湖令陶馥及振威將軍司馬流。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 Later, Han Huang campaigned against Huan Yi (桓彝, Huan Wen's father) at Wuhu. After pushing him back, Han Huang advanced to Xuancheng, pillaging the area before returning to Su Jun.(辛未，彝進屯蕪湖。韓晃擊破之，因進攻宣城，彝退保廣德，晃大掠諸縣而還。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 93 As loyalist troops began surrounding Su Jun, Su Jun sent Han Huang to Yixing. Han Huang fought with Huan Yi again at Lanshi (蘭石, in present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) through Huan's general Yu Zong (俞縱). Although Han Huang was coming close to annihilating Yu Zong's army, Yu refused to retreat and perished in battle. Han Huang proceed to attack Jing County where Huan Yi had camped. Han Huang killed Huan in battle after Huan's subordinate Jiang Bo (江播) betrayed him.(韓晃又攻宣城，害太守桓彝。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 Han Huang was assaulting Daye (大業, in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) when news of Su Jun's death in battle reached him. The rebels had appointed Su Jun's brother Su Yi (蘇逸) as his successor at Shitou, so Han Huang withdrew from Daye to see Su Yi. The following year, Han Huang joined Su Yi in attacking the governmental complex at Jiankang. Han Huang fought Mao Bao where the two exchanged banter. Han said to Mao, \\"You are said to be a brave man, why not come out and fight?\\" to which Mao replied \\"You are said to be a skillful general, why not come in and fight?\\" Han laughed before eventually withdrawing.(蘇逸、蘇碩、韓晃幷力攻臺城，焚太極東堂及祕閣，毛寶登城，射殺數十人。晃謂寶曰：「君名勇果，何不出鬬？」寶曰：「君名健將，何不入鬬？」晃笑而退。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 94 Su Jun's other brother, Su Shuo (蘇碩) would be killed by Wen Jiao which worried Han Huang and the other commanders as the loyalists approached Shitou. Han Huang led Su Yi and his remaining forces to Qu'a (曲阿, in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) to join Zhang Jian but the passes and gates in Shitou were so narrow that his followers began stampeding on each other, leaving thousands dead. It also gave loyalist troops ample time to catch up with the rebels, and they captured and executed Su Yi, although Han Huang and the others managed to escape, changing their destination to Guzhang. Han Huang would make his last stand at Mount Pingling (平陵山, in present-day Liyang, Jiangsu) when Chi Jian's Army Advisor, Li Hong (李閎) surrounded the remaining rebels. Zhang Jian (張健) and the rest of the rebel leaders were afraid to come down from the mountain. Han Huang personally went out with two quiver of arrows and sat on a chair. Han Huang took aim at the loyalists and killed many of them. It was not until he ran out of arrows that he would be killed. The remaining rebels would perish with him, thus ending Su Jun's rebellion.(健又疑弘徽等不與己同，盡殺之，更以舟軍自延陵向長塘，小大二萬餘口，金銀寶物不可勝數。揚烈將軍王允之與吳興諸軍擊健，大破之，獲男女萬餘口。健復與馬雄、韓晃等輕軍俱走，閎率銳兵追之，及於岩山，攻之甚急。健等不敢下山，惟晃獨出，帶兩步靫箭，卻據胡床，彎弓射之，傷殺甚眾。箭盡，乃斬之。健等遂降，並梟其首。) Book of Jin, Volume 100  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.)

He was the brother of the famed Jin general Zu Ti who marched north to reclaim lost lands from the barbarians. After Ti's death in 321, Zu Yue succeeded him but was said to have lacked his talents. In 327, dissatisfied with his treatment by the Jin court, he joined forces with Su Jun and took over the capital. However, he was defeated by loyalist forces in 329 and fled to Later Zhao, where he and his family would be executed by Shi Le.  Career under the Jin dynasty  Zu Yue hailed from Qiuxian county, Fanyang commandery and was the younger brother of Zu Ti, who he had a friendly relationship with. In his youth, Zu Yue received the title of \\"Xiaolian (孝廉; Filial and Incorrupt)\\" and worked as the Magistrate of Chenggao County. After the Disaster of Yongjia in 311, he would follow his brother south to Sima Rui, serving in a few offices such as the Attendant Officer of the Household Gentlemen and was said to equally famous to Ruan Fu (阮孚) of Chenliu.(祖約，字士少，豫州刺史逖之弟也。初以孝廉為成皋令，與逖甚相友愛。永嘉末，隨逖過江。元帝稱制，引為掾屬，與陳留阮孚齊名。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 Despite his respectful career, he would soon land himself in trouble due to his marital problems at home. Zu Yue had a very jealous wife who was very suspicious of him to the point of fearing her. One night, Zu Yue was suddenly injured by someone, and he suspected that this was his wife's doing. Zu Yue begged Sima Rui to allow him to resign but he did not allow, so Zu instead abandoned his post. The Minister of Justice, Liu Wei (劉隗), wanted to execute him for his neglectance but Sima Rui prevented him from doing so.(後轉從事中郎，典選舉。約妻無男而性妒，約亦不敢違忤。嘗夜寢於外，忽為人所傷，疑其妻所為，約求去職，帝不聽，約便從右司馬營東門私出。司直劉隗劾之曰：「約幸荷殊寵，顯位選曹，銓衡人物，眾所具瞻。當敬以直內，義以方外，杜漸防萌，式遏寇害。而乃變起蕭牆，患生婢妾，身被刑傷，虧其膚髮。群小噂嚃，囂聲遠被，塵穢清化，垢累明時。天恩含垢，猶復慰喻，而約違命輕出，既無明智以保其身，又孤恩廢命，宜加貶黜，以塞眾謗。」帝不之罪。隗重加執據，終不許。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 While Zu Ti won merits in his northern expedition, Zu Yue too benefitted back home with promotions until he reached Palace Attendant. Zu Ti would pass away in 321 and Yue would take over his army as General Who Pacifies The West and Inspector of Yuzhou. His half-brother, Zu Na (祖納) warned Sima Rui that giving his brother that much power would lead to rebellion, but he ignored it as Na was notorious for his jealousy of Yue. Despite that, Zu Yue would find his new-found position difficult to hold, as his lack of ability to impose discipline and awful relations with his brother's generals made him very unpopular among his men.(及逖有功於譙沛，約漸見任遇。逖卒，自侍中代逖為平西將軍、豫州刺史，領逖之眾。約異母兄光祿大夫納密言於帝曰：「約內懷陵上之心，抑而使之可也。今顯侍左右，假其權勢，將為亂階矣。」帝不納。時人亦謂納與約異生，忌其寵貴，故有此言。而約竟無綏馭之才，不為士卒所附。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 Shortly after Zu Ti's death, Later Zhao forces quickly retook lands that they had lost to Zu Ti. Zu Yue could not hold out and lost Xiangcheng, Chengfu (城父, in present-day Bozhou, Anhui) and Chenliu as a result.(祖逖旣卒，後趙屢寇河南，拔襄城、城父，圍譙。豫州刺史祖約不能禦，退屯壽春。後趙遂取陳留，梁、鄭之間復騷然矣。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 91 In 324, Zu Yue would join the loyalist side during Wang Dun's second insurrection against Jin after he was summoned to the capital by Emperor Ming. Zu Yue drove out Wang's Administrator of Huainan Ren Tai (任台) at Shouyang (壽陽, in present-day Lu'an, Anhui).(及王敦舉兵，約歸衛京都，率眾次壽陽，逐敦所署淮南太守任台。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 After the death of Emperor Ming the following year, his brother-in-law Yu Liang would become the paramount leader of Jin with the child emperor Emperor Cheng of Jin under his watch. Zu Yue saw himself as an independent warlord, so he tried to distance himself from the new regime. He hoped to that the government would give him the privilege to hand out offices to his subordinates, much like his other equals, but that did not happen. He also sent multiple petitions for it but they were either rejected or ignored. Even worse, when an imperial edict promoting ministers was declared, he, along with Tao Kan, were left out from the edict, and all this caused Zu to suspect that Yu Liang had a hand in his misfortunes.(約以功封五等侯，進號鎮西將軍，使屯壽陽，為北境籓捍。自以名輩不後郗、卞，而不豫明帝顧命，又望開府，及諸所表請多不見許，遂懷怨望... 先是，太后使蔡謨勞之，約見謨，瞋目攘袂，非毀朝政。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 In 326, Zu Yue would be attacked by Later Zhao forces under Shi Cong (石聰) at Shouchun. Zu sent edicts to Jiankang demanding for help but none came. They only considered action when Shi Cong attacked Junqiu (浚遒, in present-day Feidong County, Anhui) and Fuling (阜陵; in present-day Quanjiao County, Anhui) but it was only through the effort of the warlord, Su Jun, that repelled Shi Cong by sending his general Han Huang. Zu Yue's relationship with the court further deteriorate as plans to make a dyke to prevent further invasions were made. Zu was angered by the fact that the dyke would cut him off from the capital, leaving him isolated in the face of a future invasion.(石聰嘗以眾逼之，約屢表請救，而官軍不至。聰既退，朝議又欲作塗塘以遏胡寇，約謂為棄己，彌懷憤恚。) Book of Jin, Volume 100  Su Jun's Rebellion  The next year, Su Jun rebelled against the Jin dynasty. Su Jun had heard of Zu Yue's grudge with Yu Liang and his government, so invited him to join. Zu Yue was delighted by his offer, and sent nephew Zu Huan and brother-in-law Xu Liu to aid Su Jun in capturing Jiankang. There were attempts to discourage Zu Yue from joining Su Jun by Huan Xuan and his brother's widow but he would not listen.(及蘇峻舉兵，遂推崇約而罪執政，約聞而大喜。從子智及衍並傾險好亂，又贊成其事，於是命逖子沛內史渙，女婿淮南太守許柳以兵會峻。逖妻，柳之姊也，固諫不從。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 When Su Jun took over the capital in 328, Su Jun appointed him Palace Attendant, Grand Commandant, and Prefect of the Masters of Writing. While the rebellion raged on in the south, Later Zhao attacked Zu Yue at Huaishang. One of Zu Yue's general, Chen Guang (陳光), betrayed and attacked him. Zu Yue's Attendant and also his look-alike, Yan Tu (閻禿), pretended to be him while he secretly escaped the city in the night.(穎川人陳光率其屬攻之，約左右閻禿貌類約，光謂為約而擒之，約逾垣護免。光奔于石勒。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 The Jin general, Wen Jiao, issued a call to arms against Su Jun and Zu Yue. Many loyalist rose up against them and gathered around the capital's region. While Wen Jiao was at the Qiezi Rivermouth (茄子浦, in present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), his subordinate Mao Bao went against his orders and successfully attacked a shipment of rice that Su Jun was sending to Zu Yue, leaving Zu and his men starving as a result.(陶侃、溫嶠軍于茄子浦；嶠以南兵習水，蘇峻兵便步，令：「將士有上岸者死！」會峻送米萬斛饋祖約，約遣司馬桓撫等迎之。毛寶帥千人爲嶠前鋒，告其衆曰：「兵法，『軍令有所不從』，豈可視賊可擊，不上岸擊之邪！」乃擅往襲撫，悉獲其米，斬獲萬計，約由是飢乏。嶠表寶爲廬江太守。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 94 Later, Zu Yue sent his generals Zu Huan (祖渙) and Huan Fu (桓撫) to attack Penkou (湓口, in present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi). They managed to defeat Mao Bao at first but he then returned to drive them off. Mao Bao proceeded to attack and capture Zu Yue's camps in Hefei.(約眾潰，奔曆陽。遣兄子渙攻桓宣於皖城，會毛寶援宣，擊渙，敗之。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 With an already sour relation with his generals and his continuous defeats, Zu Yue's generals plotted with Later Zhao to kill him. Shi Cong and Shi Kan (石堪) attacked Zu Yue at Shouchun and his forces scattered, causing him to flee to Liyang.(而約之諸將復陰結於勒，請為內應。勒遣石聰來攻之，約眾潰，奔曆陽。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 Su Jun would be killed in battle late into 328 and was succeeded by his brother Su Yi (蘇逸). The situation for Zu Yue continued to worsen as the loyalist Zhao Yin (趙胤) attacked his base the next year. While Zu Yue's general Gan Miao (甘苗) fought Zhao Yin, he secretly fled to Later Zhao with his families and followers. Gan Miao would surrender to Zhao Yin, thus ending his part in the rebellion.(趙胤復遣將軍甘苗從三焦上曆陽，約懼而夜遁，其將牽騰率眾出降。約以左右數百人奔于石勒。) Book of Jin, Volume 100 The remaining rebels of Su Yi would be destroyed later that year.  Flight to Later Zhao and death  Although Zu Yue was at Later Zhao's doors, its emperor, Shi Le despised his character. His advisor Cheng Xia and general Yao Yizhong shared his sentiment and advised him to kill Zu Yue. Shi Le hosted a banquet for Zu Yue and his followers in 330 and had Cheng Xia invited them, intending to trap him there. At the banquet, Zu Yue began to realise that he was going to die, so he drank heavily. Zu Yue and his followers were then brought to the marketplace to be executed. Before he died, Zu Yue cried while holding his grandsons. The men were executed while the women were distributed among the tribes in Zhao. Only his nephew, Zu Xian (祖羡), survived due to the help of Zu Ti's slave-turned-Later Zhao general Wang An (王安).(勒薄其為人，不見者久之。勒將程遐說勒曰：「天下粗定，當顯明逆順，此漢高祖所以斬丁公也。今忠於事君者莫不顯擢，背叛不臣者無不夷戮，此天下所以歸伏大王也。祖約猶存，臣切惑之。且約大引賓客，又占奪鄉里先人田地，地主多怨。」於是勒乃詐約曰：「祖侯遠來，未得喜歡，可集子弟一時俱會。」至日，勒辭之以疾，令遐請約及其宗室。約知禍及，大飲致醉。既至於市，抱其外孫而泣。遂殺之，並其親屬中外百餘人悉滅之，婦女伎妾班賜諸胡。) Book of Jin, Volume 100  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.)

The cottage is a one-and-a-half-stories with a hipped roof and central chimney. The architecture is an example of early 19th century vernacular style patterned on Irish thatched-roofed cottages. Though the exact date of construction cannot be confirmed, based on evidence from construction techniques, architectural style, and oral history the date for its construction are placed between 1820 and 1840, making it one of the oldest residential structures in St. John's. Two other buildings in St.John's of the same style are Anderson House, built 1804–1805, and Martin McNamara House, exact construction date unknown. These three structures are the best preserved examples of late 18th and early 19th century architecture in St.John's.  History  Mallard Cottage was built by the Mallard Family, an Irish-immigrant family of fisherfolk and farmers, who resided in the property from its construction until the early 1980s. Though the date of construction is unclear there is a transaction shown in the Registry of Deeds dating to 1803 showing an exchange of chattels between a William Mallard, fisherman, and Messrs. Cunningham, Bell, and Co of St. John's.  Restoration and heritage designation  In 1985 the property was purchased by Peg Magnone. After purchasing, the property underwent major restoration and modernization work. At the time of purchase the property did not have electricity, running water, or an indoors bathroom. Great care was taken in the renovation to preserve the historical significance of the property while also making it usable as an antique shop. The cottage was successfully operated as an antiques store from 1985 until it was purchased from Magnone's granddaughter in 2011. After Mallard Cottage was purchased in 2011, work began on converting it into a restaurant, including an extension at the rear to create additional dining area of 30 square metres. In addition to the extension a major structural overhaul was completed due to the advanced state of deterioration in certain parts of the cottage when it was purchased. For their success in restoring the cottage as close as possible to its original condition, the owners were presented with the Southcott Award in 2013. Mallard Cottage was designated a National Historic Site by Parks Canada in fall 1983, a Registered Heritage Structure by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador in December 1986 and a Heritage Building by the City of St. John's in 2006.  Current usage  Since November 2013, Mallard Cottage has been run as a restaurant. Known for their use of local ingredients and culinary inspiration, the restaurant created by chefs Todd Perrin, Kim Doyle and Sommelier Stephen Lee has won many accolades including being ranked the 22nd best restaurant in Canada by Canada's 100 Best in 2018.

Koontz and Cameron Burns. It features a series of horror shorts written and directed by Aaron B. Koontz, Courtney Andujar, Hillary Andujar, Anthony Cousins, Emily Hagins, Chris McInroy, Noah Segan and Baron Vaughn. The film debuted at the Sitges Film Festival in October 2019, and was released exclusively on Shudder on June 18th, 2020.  Plot  The film is presented as an anthology of short horror films, built into a frame narrative which acts as its own horror film. The frame narrative focuses on Chad Buckley, a horror aficionado who runs a struggling video store. He takes on a new hire, much to the chagrin of an obnoxious regular customer named Sam who has been trying to persuade Chad to hire him for years. The shorts are films that are either described to other characters or viewed as one of the video rentals offered at the store.  \\"Rad Chad's Horror Emporium, Horror Hypothesis\\"/Frame narrative/\\"Horror Hypothesis\\"  The film opens with the short \\"Cold Open\\", after which Mike (one of the people featured in the short) is shown describing the short as a horror movie pitch to Chad, who picked him up as a hitchhiker. After dropping off Mike Chad opens his video store, Rad Chad's Horror Emporium, and rejects Sam's latest attempt at employment. Another person, Hawn, applies for the same position and is instantly hired. Sam arrives at the checkout counter with a videotape he wants to rent and describes the opening of the movie, which begin the next segment, \\"One Time In The Woods\\". As the day progresses Chad trains Hawn and a series of events prompts the launch of the other shorts, which make up a large portion of the film. Chad is ultimately betrayed by Hawn, who was actually part of a scientific group running experiments on a serial killer known as the \\"Devil's Lake Impaler\\" under the video store. Imprisoned with several others, Chad identifies the others as horror character stereotypes, the jock, the stoner, the slut, the token black guy and the final girl, Chad realizes he's the know-it-all-horror- guy and they're all in an actual horror movie. When the Impaler inevitably overcomes his captors, Chad chooses to flee with the person he identifies as the final girl and the stoner. While escaping Chad learns that cars cannot start if the killer is within 14 meters of the car and that the Impaler became a serial killer after a group of frat boys killed his friend Jimmy. The remaining group members reunite, at which point Chad realizes that he had misidentified the slut and final girl. Their escape is halted when they discover that security protocol prevents the elevator from allowing them to reach the exit, however they are assisted by the sudden appearance of Joe Bob Briggs, who dies in the process. Chad is then killed by the Impaler, who follows the true final girl and the stoner to the surface. The stoner tricks the Impaler into believing him to be Jimmy and the final girl manages to incapacitate him, however the stoner dies after trying to move the body away so that they can start the getaway car. The final girl flees to a field, where she wakens from a nightmare to discover that the Impaler is in the car with her. She dodges his assault and runs out of the car, where Mike from the Cold Open intercepts her and tosses a cigarette causing the car to explode and presumably kill the Impaler.  \\"Cold Open\\"  Mike Myers is a stock, horror movie background character tasked with facilitating the horrible circumstances other unsuspecting horror characters find themselves in. He fiddles with a loose road sign arrow indicating the location of an insane asylum. The arrow spins in the wrong direction, causing a group of unsuspecting young people on their way to a camp, to instead drive to the insane asylum. Mike vents about his job to his friend Wendy, and in a series of flashbacks, we see Mike at work... planting satanic relics in an attic, fooling a house buying couple into buying a haunted house, and setting up a cursed doll. Mike expresses a desire to be an actual character and not just a cold open. Mike cuts the power to a house where two women are babysitting on Halloween. Instead of leaving like he's supposed to, he sticks around. The women realize he's the one who cut the power so come up with a plan and invite him in. Hannah attacks Mike with his wire cutters, but slips and falls on some candy Mike dropped, impaling herself in the neck. Tess sneaks up behind Mike as he tries removing the cutters from Hannah's neck, and he accidentally stabs Tess with them. Mike puts on a white mask to keep from being sprayed in the face with blood from Tess' wound, then picks up her bloody knife. Wendy shows up as a cop and shoots Mike in the shoulder, believing he is a masked killer.  \\"One Time In The Woods\\"  Trip, Mark, Dawn and Brenda are camping in the woods. Mark steps in some mysterious green goo that he thinks is bug guts. A crazed man shows up warning them to leave and that he is going to kill them. The man falls, starts convulsing and expelling green and orange goo. Dawn and Brenda beat him with sticks, and the man instructs them to use silver as his skin begins to rip from his body, spraying blood all over Dawn and Brenda. Trip puts silver handcuffs on the man as he deforms into a pile of goo, blood and guts, the silver having paused the transformation. Trip puts on a mask, and the goo-man identifies him as the \\"Back Woods Slasher\\". Mark tries throwing an axe at him but misses and instead hits a passing biker in the genitals. Trip bear hugs Mark, causing his guts to spill out, killing him. Dawn and Brenda run into the woods. Brenda accidentally impales herself in the mouth on a tree branch. Trip throws a large rock at her head, exploding it. Dawn runs further into the woods. A man approaches her and asks where the goo-man is. Trip pulls the man's legs off and beats him with them. Trip chases Dawn back to the camp site and slips in some green goo, falling and impaling his face on the back of the axe stuck in the biker's genitals. Goo-man bites Dawn and she transforms into a pile of green goo too.  \\"M.I.S.T.,E.R.\\"  A Husband sits alone at a bar, chatting with the Bartender, who creeps the husband out. The Husband goes to the bathroom and notices a flyer advertising an organization called M.I.S.T.E.R., which stands for Men In Serious Turmoil Establishing Rights. As The Husband ponders the flyer, we flashback to an argument between him and his wife where she complains about his lack of effort with the family and wants him to be a man. The Husband goes to a M.I.S.T.E.R. meeting where the group's leader is giving a pep talk to the men in attendance. In a montage, we cut back and forth between the members complaining about their neutered lives. After the meeting the leader talks with the Husband, encouraging him to join the group and invites him to a get-together happening that night. The Husband goes home and is about to put something in a duffel bag, but we don't see what. He arrives at the get-together that takes place on a football field. The leader snaps his fingers and the lights to the stadium go out. The group transforms into werewolves. The Husband kills each werewolf one by one using different weapons.

She's being stalked by an unseen person who breathes heavily. She notices a lollipop in the shape of a human skull that says \\"Not For Sale\\". She steals the lollipop and leaves the store with Ali. The Store Clerk eyes them suspiciously. Ray and Ali get in the car with their friend Jamie, who drives. The stalker from the store watches them from inside another car. The stalker follows them as they drive to a hotel. The stalker watches them through the window of the room as they start drinking and listening to music. Ray reveals the lollipop she stole. Ali and Ray lick the lollipop. From the stalker's POV we see Jamie look toward the window and close the curtains. Ali feels strange and goes to lay down, putting a towel over her face. After a while, Jamie checks on her and startles her awake, the towel falling to the floor. Ray and Jamie are stunned, as Ali's face has transformed into the same skull like form as the lollipop. Ray's face also transforms into the skull shape. Thinking she can fix the problem, Jamie calls the convenience store, asking for help. The Store Clerk emits an evil, monstrous laugh. Jamie reaches for the lollipop skull and puts it over her face as the stalker reaches for the door handle. Jamie licks the lollipop. She pulls the stalker into the room and they kill him. They dance and have a pillow fight.  \\"The Night He Came Back Again! Part IV: The Final Kill\\"  Daisy and Greg are in bed kissing. Someone watches them from the ajar closet. Suddenly the window is smashed and a Masked Killer climbs through the window. Before the killer can stab Daisy, a group of her friends spring from the closet and subdue the killer with stun batons. We dissolve to the garage, where the killer wakes up, tied to a table, surrounded by Daisy and her friends. Daisy expresses her anger at the killer for killing her friends and boyfriends every year. Someone hands her a knife and she stabs the killer in the chest. The killer wakes up and she stabs him over and over again. Greg tries to demonstrate that the killer is dead, but the killer stabs him in the back of the head with the knife. Next they attach jumper cables to the killer's body and shock him with a car battery. Seth checks his vitals with a stethoscope, but a bolt of electricity from the killer's heart travels up the stethoscope and explodes Seth's head. Next they stuff firecrackers down the killer's mouth. The firecrackers go off, cutting the killer in half. Chloe picks up the killer's lower half, and his legs come to life, wrapping themselves around her, choking her. Will tosses the killer's intestines over the ceiling beam and pulls, causing the legs to lift Chloe into the air, killing her. Will professes his love to Daisy, but the killer watches, taunting them. Daisy grabs a shotgun and tells Will to unmask the killer. Will takes off the killer's mask, revealing an attractive man. Daisy hesitates in shooting him. The killer grabs Will by the throat, choking him. Daisy can't bring herself to shoot him, and Will dies. Daisy finally pulls the trigger, blowing a hole in the killer's head. She calls and rents a wood chipper. She shoves the killer's body into the wood chipper as he reveals that he's her brother. She tries to stop but it's too late. She watches a 4th of July fireworks display. The killer's reformed hand comes out of the pool of blood.  \\"So Much To Do\\"  An unseen person drives wearing black leather gloves. A man is tied with rope and locked in the trunk of the car. The car parks and two mysterious men in all black drag the tied man to a grave site. The tied man wakes up and pleads that he has so much to do. One of the mysterious men removes a glove, revealing a mysterious symbol glowing with light. He burns the symbol into the tied man's forehead and kicks him into the grave. They bury him alive. Later, smoke emerges from the grave and travels across the ground. Franchesca sits alone in her car, parked in a nearby empty field. She is on the phone with a friend, warning her not to spoil a TV show they're discussing. She hasn't caught up and the finale is tonight. The smoke approaches and engulfs the car. Franchesca gets out to investigate. She gets back in her car and the phone signal breaks up. Franchesca is startled by the marked man who is standing in front of her car. The man vaporizes into smoke and her windows break. She breathes in the smoke and the windows reform and fix themselves. Franchesca says she has so much to do, the same line the marked man spoke before being buried. She looks in the rearview mirror and we see the marked man. The marked man comes home and sits down to watch TV. It is the finale of the show Franchesca didn't want spoiled. Franchesca calls out to him and he goes to the mirror, revealing her standing next to him, claiming he has her body. They get into a physical confrontation, and fight over the remote. She hits him so hard he vaporizes and she has her body back. All beaten up, she goes to her car and checks her phone. A text from a friend spoils the end of the show. She drives off and the two mysterious men from earlier follow her.

Koontz revealed his approach to creating a horror anthology. “I’m a big fan of anthology films but knew we had to change the game up a bit,” said Koontz in a statement. “So we gathered this hungry group of diverse, super-talented horror enthusiasts and asked them to subvert these well-known horror tropes while also paying homage to them. In the end, it made for a unique experience that I cannot wait for audiences to discover.\\"  Release  The film was released exclusively on Shudder on June 18th, 2020.  Reception  The film holds an approval rating of 82% at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Some of its contents are more entertaining than others, but genre fans should still find this Scare Package well worth opening.\\" Slashfilm wrote \\"Scare Package is destined to become a midnight crowd favorite, a consistently funny love letter to the genre, made by people who love horror for people to love horror.\\" We Got This Covered remarked that although the film has \\"a few bumps in the road... it’s a horror satire made by horror devotees who want to laugh alongside fans who’ve dedicated entire lives to a genre that’s self-admittedly not without its faults.\\"  References External links * Category:2019 horror films Category:American horror anthology films Category:American comedy horror films Category:Shudder (streaming service) original programming ","title":"Scare Package"},{"id":"65082851","text":"Camponotus ligniperda, the brown-black carpenter ant, is a common species of carpenter ant distributed widely throughout Europe. Found in a variety of woodland habitats, they commonly nest on the ground in dry tree stumps, dead fallen trees, or beneath stones and wooden logs that are partially buried. C. ligniperda is an ecologically dominant species wherever it is found due to both its large size and particularly aggressive nature. Description Camponotus ligniperda is one of if not the largest extant ant species found in Europe, with queens reaching lengths of 16–18 mm (potentially 20 mm when physogastric) followed by 14–15 mm major workers. Intermediate and minor workers measure on average 7–10 mm. Individuals are typically bicolored with a black head and a reddish brown thorax which color bleeds into the legs and anterior segment of the dark colored gaster. Considered a sister species to Camponotus herculeanus, the species can be distinguished by its larger size, brighter color and shinier gaster. Biology=Behavior C. ligniperda is behaviorally similar to C. herculeanus, but differs primarily in its nesting habits as it is considered a more xerothermic species of the two. As both are generally sympatric and share similar habitats, including conifer forests in the northernmost parts of their range to the mixed deciduous woodlands common to central Europe, C. ligniperda deviates in that it is overall less boreal and prefers sunnier, drier areas where it is found. These ants aggressively defend their nests and when alarmed, workers intermittently and rapidly knock on the walls of their nest with their mandibles. When nearby workers sense these knocks, they move closer to the source and become increasingly aggressive towards any disturbance in their immediate vicinity. As aggressive as they may be, the bites from the workers of this species even from the larger majors are not particularly significant to humans. Despite so, these ants are fiercely territorial against other species of ant for which they're sympatric with and the majors can be quite effective in this regard, being capable of decapitating the workers of Formica or of other Camponotus species. Workers are active both during the day and night, foraging for insect prey or for the sweet secretions produced by sap-sucking hemipterans. Seasonal activity peaks during midsummer and declines during the onset of fall. These ants like their relative C. herculeanus are extremely cold tolerant and can enter a lengthy diapause period as long as 4–5 months during the winter. Colonies are slow to grow but when mature can exceed 7,000 workers in population. Mature colonies may also occupy numerous satellite nests over a wide area. Similar to C. herculeanus, C. ligniperda is an occasional pest of structures as it can excavate into and inhabit the wooden frameworks of homes and buildings, much to the dismay of property owners. Treatment usually involves insecticidal spraying of known nests, usage of poison baits or fixing sources of water leaks to prevent the softening of wood that makes it ideal for invasion by these ants. Reproduction C. ligniperda has its nuptial flights from late May to July. These large ants develop slowly with the first workers emerging 1.8 months or more after the first eggs were laid.

The temple is Shimla's second most visited Hanuman temple after Jakhoo temple.  History  The temple was established in 1950 by prominent religious figure Neem Karoli Baba. He got so amazed by the beauty of Shimla that he spent 10–12 days in the forest area. Here while doing Yoga and meditation Baba got some instinct that Hanuman temple should be built on this site. Baba told his wish to his followers and eventually in the year of 1962 the then Lieutenant Governor Raja Bajrang Bahadur Singh and other followers started the construction of the temple. The idols if Lord Rama-Sita- Lakshmana, Lord Shiva and Lord Ganesha were also established in the temple. The temple was inaugurated on 21 June 1966 on the day of Tuesday. Gradually the temple gained a lot of popularity and faith. alt=  Present  At present the locals come here everyday, as well as tourists who visit Shimla. Because it is Lord Hanuman temple, every Tuesday and Saturday a lot of people visit, and on Sundays huge number of people visit the temple. On each Sunday a large Langar is also organised here. In the vicinity of the temple there is also the small temple dedicated to Neem Karoli Baba, which was made few years back. The natural beauty and the lush green forest with enchanting environment attracts a lot of tourists. The view of Shimla city is also seen from the temple. It is believed that whatever is prayed here with the true heart then big Sankat (risks) can be vanished from the life.  Location  The temple is located at an altitude of 1,975 m above sea level on Kalka-Shimla highway. The natural beauty and the lush green forest with enchanting environment attracts a lot of tourists. The view of Shimla city is also seen from the temple. The temple not only casts a spell on visitors with its divinity, but also reels them in with the majestic views it offers.

Conn (1919–2013) was a Scottish bacteriologist known primarily for her work on preventing the spread of typhoid in Edinburgh in the summer of 1970. Life Agnes Kirkland Conn was born on 27 June 1919 in Barrhead, Scotland to James Charles Conn and Margaret Aitken. Her father was a Church of Scotland minister, who in 1926 was translated to Broughty Ferry, and so Nancy attended the High School of Dundee. She earned an MA in Modern History and English in 1940 from the University of St Andrews, and in 1945 graduated M.B.,Ch.B from the Bute Medical School there. She worked at the Central Microbiological Laboratories at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital until December 1972, when she became a consultant and the Deputy Director of the Western Regional Hospital Board in Glasgow. She retired in 1979. She was a Soroptimist and a member of the National Trust for Scotland. She died aged 93 on 20 March 2013. 1970 typhoid outbreak In the summer of 1970, several patients were admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital at Western General with typhoid fever. After interviewing the patients, Conn discovered they had all spent time by the Water of Leith and had drunk the river water. Using Dr. White's brand sanitary towels as water sampling devices, Conn narrowed down the source to a surface water drain in Colinton. Conn, with help from the City of Edinburgh Health Department, took samples from the sewer and surface water drain system. They discovered an improper connection which meant raw sewage was passing straight into the river. After identifying the housing tenement with the connection problem, Conn found that the source of the typhoid bacteria was a 76 year old woman who was completely asymptomatic. Since the phage type of the Salmonella typhi bacterium was a rare, Asiatic form, Conn was able to link the asymptomatic carrier to several other local typhoid cases dating back to 1963. If not for Conn's detective work and the faulty sewer connection, the source patient would never have known she was carrying the bacterium. All of Conn's work took place over two months and no further typhoid cases were admitted to the hospital after the source was discovered. Publications * N.K. Conn et al.

It disappeared in a reorganization of 1910. Location Banana used to be a fishing village in a sheltered cove. A map of the Congo Free State in 1897 shows the town of Banana on the north side of the bay where the Congo River enters the Atlantic Ocean. The Banana District extended a short distance along the north bank of the river to the Boma District. To the north it bordered the Portuguese territory of Cabinda, and the Portuguese territory to the south of the Congo faced it across the river. History The people of Banana were in contact with Europeans for four centuries before the Belgians established their colony. From November 1874 to 12 August 1877 Henry Morton Stanley made his first trans-Africa exploration, crossing the African continent from Zanzibar to Banana. During the expedition he explored Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, and recorded the course of the Congo River from the Luama River to the cataracts downstream from Stanley Pool. When the first members of the International Association of the Congo (Association Internationale du Congo: AIC) came to Banana in 1878 they found the main posts of four factories, two French, one British and one Dutch. The Congo Free State was created at the start of 1885 with Leopold II of Belgium as its absolute ruler. On 17 September 1885 the Congo Free State joined the Universal Postal Union. The next day it was decreed that post offices would be established at Banana, Boma and Vivi. The extent of Banana District was defined on 7 January 1886 as being from the ocean up the north coast of the river to and including Ponta da Lenha. On 19 January 1886 Leopold issued a decree to protect the shore at Banana from erosion, forbidding any work that would tend to damage the banks such as removing sand, earth or stones, or digging holes. On 23 April 1886 he decreed that the seat of the court of first instance of Bas-Congo would be at Banana. At first maritime navigation was concentrated in Banana since Boma was thought to be inaccessible to heavy vessels. Banana was the main port from which goods produced in the colony were exported to Europe, and where export duties were collected. Of the exported products, the most valuable were ivory, palm kernels, palm oil and rubber. During the months of January, February and March 1890, 25 ocean-going vessels arrived at Banana and 30 departed, compared to 8 arrivals and 10 departures for Boma. Later, the government marked the channels with buoys up to Boma and Matadi, and built lighthouses. The Congo Free State founded a naval training school at Banana, and the Boma Red Cross built a sanitarium where sick colonists could recover their health beside the sea. By 1898, the district of Banana had a total of 95 Europeans in 25 houses. The Congo Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 as the Belgian Congo. In 1910 the western districts of Banana, Boma, Matadi and Cataracts were consolidated into one administrative unit, Bas-Congo (Lower Congo).

When the Soviet Union occupied Latvia in 1940, the Latvian Scout Organization was banned. Klētnieks eventually fled Latvia for a displaced persons camp in Germany, where he remained for five years following the end of World War II. In 1950, he settled with his wife and children as refugees in the United States, where he continued to write books in the Latvian language and joined the Boy Scouts of America national staff. The pre-war years Klētnieks was born on December 4, 1905, in Vaive parish, a village in what was then the Cēsis District of Latvia, when that country was still part of Czarist Russia. In 1917, Latvian boys who had been evacuated to Tartu, Estonia, during World War I and were introduced to Scouting there, formed the earliest Boy Scout troops in Latvia upon their return. Among them was Arvīds Brēdermanis, a future foreign service officer with the Latvian government. Klētnieks joined a newly formed Boy Scout troop soon after as a 13-year old. In 1924, he graduated from the Cesis Bērzaine State Secondary School (now the Cēsis State Gymnasium) and then began studies at Latvian University, eventually earning a degree in mathematics in 1942. When Latvia gained its independence from Russia in 1920, the Latvian Scout Organization, Latvijas Skautu Organizācija, was established, led by Kārlis Goppers as president of the movement in the newly independent Baltic republic. Klētnieks began writing articles for the group's Latvian Scout magazine in 1925, soon after his graduation from secondary school. In 1928, he wrote a children's book, Fire in the Great Camp. He went to England in 1929, the birthplace of world Scouting, for Wood Badge advanced training for Scouting leaders at Gilwell Park. Upon his return, he was instrumental in introducing the Rover Scout program to Latvian Scouting. In 1933, he co- authored the Latvian Scout handbook, Vadītājs; rokas grāmata skautu vadītājiem, published in Riga. He also contributed to the Journal of the Latvian Institute of History, published in Riga in 1939. Klētnieks served as national Scout Commissioner and later executive director of the Latvian Scout Organization, alongside Kārlis Goppers as president. Klētnieks' wife served as head of the Latvian Girl Guides until both groups were forcibly disbanded in mid-1940 when Latvia lost its independence. The 1940s and World War II's aftermath=Occupation of Latvia and suppression of Scouting The Cēsis State gymnasium, where Klētnieks attended secondary school In June 1940, the Soviet Union's occupation of Latvia took place. Scouting was suppressed and Klētnieks' Scout handbook was destroyed by communist agents appointed to abolish Scouting. A wave of arrests followed the Soviet takeover. \\"The Soviet repressive authorities regarded all organizations and parties of independent Latvia, including the Boy Scouts, as fascist or counterrevolutionary\\", concluded a University of Latvia study in 2005. The Latvian Scout president, Kārlis Goppers, was executed after a Stalinist show trial and Scouting went underground. Arvīds Brēdermanis was arrested as a spy and imprisoned in a Soviet gulag for fifteen years. With Scouting officially disbanded in Latvia, Klētnieks resumed his studies at Latvian University, earning a degree in mathematics in 1942. Between 1941 and 1944, Nazi Germany occupied Latvia during World War II, forcing Soviet withdrawal. By October 1944, the Red Army had regained control of most of Latvia, including its capital, Riga, and Klētnieks was in a German displaced persons camp. After the war ended, he remained at Camp Kathann near Hersbruck, in the American occupation zone of divided Germany. A former Nazi concentration camp, it was used for Latvian displaced persons in the postwar Latvian diaspora. Klētnieks served as Scout Executive-in-exile for the 4,000 Latvian Scouts there until 1950. While in Germany, he resumed writing, including magazine articles for fellow Latvian exiles and a book, Latviešu skautisma trīsdesmit gadi, 1917-1947 (\\"30 Years of Latvian Scouting, 1917–1947\\"), published in 1947. Also that year, his research into Latvian chronology issues from the 16th to the 20th centuries, Pētījums par chronologijas problēmām Latvijā XVI-XX gadsimta (\\"An examination of the problems of chronology in Latvia from the 16th to the 20th centuries\\"), was published. In the United States Klētnieks and his family went to the United States as refugees in May 1950, sponsored and given shelter by a Boy Scouts of America (BSA) official, E. Urner Goodman, at his Bondville, Vermont, summer home, Innisfree. Goodman was the BSA's National Program Director at the time, as well as the celebrated founder of the Order of the Arrow. While staying with the Goodmans, the Klētnieks family appeared at a Brattleboro, Vermont, church in December 1950, where they spoke of their wartime experiences as exiles and recalled Christmas in Latvia, singing the songs of their homeland to the delight of those who heard them. After Goodman's retirement from the BSA in 1951, Klētnieks remained at Innisfree to help in the running of his host's summer camp for boys. He also served as a local troop's Scoutmaster. In 1954, Klētnieks began working for the Boy Scouts of America, serving as a campmaster in Chicago and later as camping director at the BSA's National Training Center, located at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation in New Jersey. Postwar writings As an émigré to the U.S., Klētnieks continued writing about Latvian history, including a second, expanded edition of his 1947 book, Latviešu skautisma trīsdesmit gadi, 1917-1947, published in 1960. The 414-page illustrated work, 40 Years of Latvian Scouting, 1917-1957, is a comprehensive history of the Scouting movement in Latvia during a turbulent period of two world wars, invasion, oppression, and exile. In the 1950s, he also wrote Ugunskurs (\\"Campfire\\"), a publication for Latvian exiles. Later, he wrote Klintenieši: stāsts trimdas jauniešiem (\\"The Klintins: a story for young people in exile\\") in 1963, about those who used their Scouting skills to survive in the forests of Latvia during the Soviet occupation of 1940–1941. He also wrote another book that year, Senču raksti: latvju raksti bērniem, about Latvian ancestral figures. It was re-published posthumously in Riga in 1990, after Latvia regained its independence from the Soviet Union and the present-day Latvian Scout and Guide Organization, Latvijas Skautu un Gaidu Centrālā Organizācija, was formed. Personal life and death Klētnieks and his wife had three children: two daughters and a son. In the 1960s, they retired to Constantine, Michigan, where Klētnieks was a community leader at Garezers, a lake resort in nearby Three Rivers popular with Latvian-Americans. While building a campfire there, he was stricken by a heart attack and died on August 17, 1968. His grandson and great-grandson became active in American Scouting and, as of 2006, his daughter lived in Riga. Many of his documents and publications covering the Latvian Scout movement prior to 1940 as well as the postwar Latvian diaspora are now preserved at the Latvian State Archives. In 2012, his remains were reburied in Vaive parish, the place of his birth in Latvia.

Nepomuceno (18 December 1881 - 30 December 1974) was a Filipino sculptor and woodcarver known for santo figures and genre sculptures. Background Graciano T. Nepomuceno was born in Trozo area in Binondo, Manila on 18 December 1881. Trozo was one of the more affluent portions of Manila at the time of his birth where many of its residents have better formal education and virtually all are fluent in Castilian Spanish. Nepomuceno initially pursued a career in painting, studying under Miguel Zaragoza at the Liceo de Manila. He switch to sculpting and became an apprentice of Ciriaco Arevalo. Arevalo is a Filipino sculptor who won a gold medal in an exhibition in Spain for his work dubbed as El Baguio. From the late 19th century until the early 1900s, Nepomuceno often collaborated with fellow sculptor and musician, Bonifacio Arévalo. After this period, Nepomuceno became more independent and did works in wood and cement medium which are primarily used as ornaments in building facades. Renowned Filipino architect Arcadio Arellano was a frequent employer of Nepomuceno. He then focused on genre sculptures and later on portraiture. He became known for direct carving in molave wood, among his contemporaries. He was also noted for his santo artworks. His work, a wooden figure of a boy playing sipa, was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Among his reputed works is the figure of St. Francis in Quiapo Church and a sculpture of Filipino nationalist José Rizal. He died on 30 December 1974.

It is considered perhaps \\"the most popular and representative\\" of the series of films that featured Garcés as an upper middle class ladies' man. Plot D'Maurice (Mauricio Garcés) is a fashion designer who pretends to be effeminate in order to fit into the world of haute couture, and taking advantage of that appearance, D'Maurice, a womanizer, seduces all his female clients while making fun of all their husbands, who confidently believe they leave their wives in good hands, such as Rebeca (Claudia Islas), the young and beautiful wife of the rich Don Álvaro, (Carlos López Moctezuma), a parody of the typical nouveau riche in the high society of Mexico. Suspecting the deception, his competitors, Perugino, Antoine and Mao (Enrique Rocha, Hugo Goodman and Carlos Nieto respectively), determined to unmask him, hire a detective (who is also effeminate) and a beautiful woman (Patricia Aspíllaga) to obtain evidence to ruin D'Maurice. Meanwhile, Magda (Irma Lozano), a beautiful waitress, falls in love with the gallantry of D'Maurice, while worrying about his sudden swings from extreme manliness to effeminacy.

His name translates roughly to \\"They Heard His Voice\\" or \\"The Pacificator.\\" Wa-o-wa-wa-na-onk was raised on the Seneca Buffalo Reservation and was educated in Quaker schools on the reservation. He graduated with a medical degree from Geneva Medical College in 1844. He was one of the first Native Americans to earn a medical degree. Wa-o-wa-wa-na-onk also worked as an interpreter on the Cattaraugus Reservation. Some records list him as a chief, or a \\"Grand Sachem,\\" but it was uncertain if he officially held the title. Wa-o-wa-wa-na-onk was a signatory on a fraudulent land treaty executed in 1838 and signed as a chief. He worked with the Quakers to have the treaty reversed, creating another treaty in 1842. On behalf of the Cayuga people in New York, he wrote a letter to the Governor of New York in 1843. In 1846, Wa-o-wa-wa-na-onk spoke to the New York Historical Society about regaining Iroquois land lost through fraud. Wa-o-wa-wa-na-onk petitioned the New York State Legislature in 1853 in order to address the issue of State compensation to the Cayuga's loss of land. He continued to seek the case in 1861 after the state did not appropriate funds for the Cayuga. He often spoke to different groups in New York in order to obtain allies in his cause to maintain the homeland of both the Seneca and Cayuga people. He also urged groups to support women's suffrage.

She is a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute.  Education  Yamini Dalal became interested in chromosome structure and epigenetic gene regulation during her Baccalaureate years at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai where she earned a B.Sc. with a double major in Biochemistry and Life Sciences in 1995. She moved to the United States for her post-graduate work. In 's laboratory at Purdue University, she used classical chromatin biochemistry tools to understand how DNA sequence motifs and linker histones can shape the chromatin structure in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. During this time, she discovered that the regions of the mouse genome contained alternating tracts of stiff and flexible DNA, which allowed in silico prediction of nucleosome positions. These positions could be recapitulated in vitro using just purified histones and DNA, and detected in vivo, at developmentally regulated genes in mice. She also studied how linker histone H1 could influence nucleosome positioning and chromatin folding in vitro and in vivo. For these studies, she received her Ph.D. from Purdue University in 2003. Histone variants were the next logical step in teasing out how intrinsic variability in the chromatin fiber can encode a diversity of biological functions. To study this aspect of chromatin structure, Dalal moved to Seattle to work with Steven Henikoff at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as a postdoctoral research associate from 2003–2007. Using a range of biochemical analyses, she and colleagues uncovered that the Drosophila centromere-specific histone variant makes non-canonical nucleosomes, features of which are reminiscent of the ancestral nucleosomes seen in the archaebacteria.  Career and research  Dalal joined National Institutes of Health in September 2008. She is a senior investigator in the laboratory of receptor biology and gene expression at the National Cancer Institute. She is director of the chromatin structure and epigenetic mechanisms group. She was awarded tenure at NIH in 2018. Dalal's lab has shown that some of these unusual features are conserved in human cells, that centromeric nucleosomes oscillate in structure and in modifications over the cell cycle. Such oscillations are perturbed in human cancers wherein CENP-A is innately mis- regulated and occupies ectopic regions of the human genome linked to instability. Her lab has also worked on dissecting the function of transcription of repetitive loci within human centromeres. We are now expanding our studies to other histone variants in human tumors, and using machine learning approaches to disrupt cancer-specific chromatin interactions.

He set up in business as a grocer, but by about 1818 had begun writing and performing his own songs in private parties and for the proprietors of Vauxhall Gardens. A prolific comic singer and songwriter, he published collections of his songs every year between 1818 and 1831.\\"The Late Mr. Thomas Hudson\\", Illustrated London News, 27 July 1844, p.56 He performed regularly in \\"song and supper rooms\\" such as the Cyder Cellars in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, which opened in the mid-1820s and had a very broad clientele ranging from tradesmen and apprentices to members of parliament; and the Coal Hole, near the Strand.Richard Anthony Baker, British Music Hall: an illustrated history, Pen & Sword, 2014, , pp.13-14 His most popular songs included \\"I Never Says Nothing to Nobody\\" (1825), \\"Barney Brallaghan's Courtship\\" (c.1830), and \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" (1830).

She is also recognized as an important feminist who fought for women's suffrage in Ecuador, for which she was targeted by the authorities.  Life  Born María Lucía Castillo Castillo in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in 1888, she was the daughter of María Blanca Bethsabé Castillo Martiz and the journalist and politician José Abel Castillo, who owned the newspaper El Telégrafo. Castillo began writing poetry at a young age, winning her first recognition, a gold medal for her poem \\"A Colombia,\\" at a Quito literary competition in 1910. In 1912, she married José Roberto Levi Hoffman, a Sephardic Jewish chemist who had immigrated from Germany just a few years prior. Their courtship had begun two years earlier with the conceit that he would teach her German and she would teach him Spanish. Castillo traveled to Paris to study in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the Sorbonne. On her return to Ecuador, she began working for the publication El Telégrafo Literario. She wrote numerous poems, which appeared both in El Telégrafo and in various magazines. As a feminist, Castillo supported the movement for women's right to vote, clashing with the authorities. In 1924, she participated in a demonstration in the streets of Guayaquil alongside fellow suffragettes. When officers on horseback attempted to stop them, she shouted: > \\"Kill us! We came to demand a right, not to beg for it.\\" In June 1933, she funded the magazine Nuevos Horizontes with a group of fellow feminists. It served as the media organ of the Legión Femenina de Educación Popular, an organization that worked to improve the rights of women workers. They also created a radio program, which the presidential candidate José María Velasco Ibarra appeared on in 1934. In 1935, Castillo was a candidate for minister of education, and El Telégrafo supported her candidacy. But women were still broadly excluded from Ecuadorian politics at the time, so she was denied the position. In 1937, her husband became an Ecuadorian citizen as Germany's persecution of the Jews escalated. He later helped persuade the national government to let Jews fleeing Europe migrate to Ecuador. The couple had several children, including the journalist Graciela Levi Castillo. She served as the Ecuadorian delegate to the Inter-American Commission of Women for many years, beginning in 1940. She also joined the Casa de la Cultura centers in Guayas and Pichincha beginning in 1946. Castillo traveled widely, spending long periods in the United States and even working as a foreign correspondent in Germany. She was a member of the National Press Club in Washington. In 1955, Castillo was declared \\"Woman of the Americas\\" by the Unión de Mujeres Americanas. She was also honored by the Ateneo Ecuatoriano in Quito the same year. In 1960, she was recognized by the Unión de Quiteños. In recognition of her poetic work, Casa de la Cultura published her collection Poemas de Ayer y de Hoy in 1962.

She would appear to be a Protestant, but in 1639 she was translating the works of the French writer and bishop Jean- Pierre Camus. Camus was a Catholic at a time when England was divided over this Christian sectarianism. The 1639 work was his romantic stories titled \\"Admirable Events\\" and she dedicated her translation to the wife of Charles I of England's French Catholic wife Henrietta Maria. She translated another work by Camus titled \\"Diotrèphe\\" in 1641. In 1657 DuVerger published the lengthily titled \\"Humble Reflections Upon some Passages of the right Honorable the Lady Marchionesse of Newcastles Olio. Or An Appeale from her mes-informed, to her owne better informed judgement\\". \\"Humble Reflections\\" was written in reply to \\"The World's Olio\\" which had been published by the noted and productive writer Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Jane Collins in the ODNB calls DuVerger's work as \\"fascinating\\" and very unusual as it demonstrates an intellectual debate about religion between two women in the seventeenth century. In 1659 her daughters were getting married in Canada. When they registered their marriages they named their mother as deceased.

On December 12, 2019, the IFL announced a second Germain-owned expansion team in Columbus to replace the recently folded Columbus Destroyers of the Arena Football League. In addition to being granted another franchise, Germain also acquired the sponsorship rights for the IFL as well as the management rights of the league's communications and marketing department. The team held a name-the-team contest and on July 28, 2020, they were named the Wild Dogs. They are announced to play at the Destroyers' former home Nationwide Arena. They will be the fourth known professional arena/indoor franchise to play in Columbus following the Columbus Thunderbolts in 1991 and the two incarnations of the Destroyers (2004–2008 and 2019).

As the sequel to Shadow Warrior 2 (2016), the game is set to be released for Windows in 2021. Gameplay Like its predecessors, the game is a first-person shooter and the player assumes control of Lo Wang, the series protagonist. In the game, Lo Wang has access to a large arsenal of firearms which can be used to defeat enemies. In addition, he also wields a katana , which is limited to close-quarters combat. At closed range, players can also execute an enemy. They can also use the environment to their advantage. As the player progresses in the game, they would receive new weapons and gadgets which aid combat. All of which would be unlocked by the time the player reaches the mid-point of the campaign. The game features more linear levels and a more streamlined upgrade system when compared with Shadow Warrior 2, though it introduced new movement options for Lo Wang, such as giving him the option to wall run, double jump, air dash, and utilize a grappling hook to quickly transverse between platforms and vertical surfaces. Story Set in Neo Feudal Japan, \\"fallen corporate ninja\\" Lo Wang and his sidekick Orochi Zilla are on a quest to track down and defeat an ancient dragon that they have accidentally awakened. Jason Liebrecht returned to provide the voice for Lo Wang. Development Shadow Warrior 3 is currently in development by Polish studio Flying Wild Hog. Game designer Paweł Kowalewski described the game as the \\"upgraded\\" version of the 2013 reboot, adding that the game is \\"over-the-top\\" and that it will make players \\"feel overpowered\\". The new movement options were added as the team \\"wanted players to be able to move freely like a ninja from their favorite animes\\". This also allowed the team to craft combat arenas that are more vertical in design. Many systems in Shadow Warrior 2, including weapon stats, procedural generated maps, and character progression, were streamlined or removed altogether in Shadow Warrior 3, so that players can focus on the action and need not to worry about their combat efficiency. The team drew inspirations from both Japanese and Chinese cultures when they were creating the game's universe. The game's humor also became more mature, with the team saying that they wanted to \\"modernise\\" Lo Wang as a video game character by giving him more backstory. Announced on July 6, 2020, the game is set to be released in 2021 for personal computers.

She was married to the American painter and illustrator Cyrus Cuneo (18 June 187923 July 1916) and their youngest son was the English painter Terence Cuneo RGI FGRA(1 November 19073 January 1996), known for using a mouse as his signature. Early life Tenison was born in Hammersmith, London, on 25 August 1869. She was the second child of her parents, Irish Doctor Edward Tenison Ryan Tenison (c. 183022 December 1904) and his second wife, Frances Sally Testelin (13 March 1842fourth quarter of 1912). Edward's first wife Fanny Hutton died between the birth of their third son Alfred on 25 October 1865 and his baptism on 1 February 1866, leaving three sons, Edward (c.1860), Arthur (born c.1861), Alfred (born c. 1866), who were half brothers to Tenison. Her full brother Adolf Heron , studied at Cambridge, trained as a doctor and settled at Hayle, Cornwall, in 1947. Education and marriage The 1881 census shows Tenison (age 11) as the only child at home with her parents, apparently under the care of Annie Florence Robinson (age 24), a governess. She studied at the Chiswick School of art from 18841886 and then, without the support of her family, at Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope's School of Art in South Kensington. By the time of the 1891 census, the Tenisons had moved to 215 Uxbridge Road, which was to remain the family both for Tenison's parents, and for Tenison's husband and children, Cyrus Cuneo's death in 1916. She then worked as a freelance illustrator, on publications like the Ludgate Magazine. By 1899 she had saved up enough money to go to Paris to study art, and she enrolled in the Académie Colarossi to train under Whistler, where she met Cyrus Cuneo. They returned to London to marry on in the last quarter of 1903. As Cuneo was an American citizen, Tenison ceased to be a British Subject on her marriage under the UK's 1870 Naturalisation Act. She did not automatically gain US citizenship by marriage, as this was subject to her being eligible to naturalization (as determined by emigration officials whenever she landed in the United States, certain races and immoral persons, etc. being excluded). Thus, British women who married aliens from 1870 to 1933, when the law changed could become stateless persons. Tenison may not have been aware of this as she recorded her nationality as English in the 1911 census. After the death of her husband, Tenison applied for naturalisation, and was re-admitted as a British subject on 27 July 1917. The couple had two sons: Desmond, (born on 12 February 1905) who became a mining engineer., and Terence, (1 November 19073 January 1996) who became a noted English painter. Work Both Tenison and her husband worked as illustrators. She was devastated when Cyrus died unexpectedly from blood poisoning in 1916. Tenison left what had been the family home and moved first to 152 Holland Park in Kensington. She was there in 1918 for the Electoral Register and again in 1920. She moved to Dartmoor, then to Cornwall, living first at Halsetown and then in St. Ives, where she bought Down-along House, which she restored, and it became The Copper Kettle (cafe). Her son Terence was prosecuted for dangerous driving in St. Ives in June 1928, and they were already living at Down-along House. Tenison became a member of the St. Ives Society of Artists in 1928 and remained a member until c. 1945. By 1931 The electoral register shows her living with both her sons at 29 Flanders Road in Chiswick. By 1934 all three had moved to 2 Gainsborough Road, Chiswick, which was to remain Tenison's London residence until her death. Tenison continued to paint. She became a member of the Society of Women Artists 1n 1918 and was a frequent exhibitor there. She also exhibited at the Royal Academy. Later life Her son Desmond was living with her at 2 Gainsborough Road in 1949, as was Lucie Newmann. Tenison died on 23 May 1953. She was living at 2 Gainsborough Road, Chiswick, London at the time. Her estate was valued at £10,776 8s. 1d. She did not nominate either of here sons as her executors. Assessment Peppin and Micklethwait said that She was a capable illustrator, often working in full colour or halftone in a style that had much in common with that of her husband.

Career De la Fontaine started his career with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1708 when he was sent to Batavia. In 1710 he was re-employed to the Dutch Cape Colony and arrived at the Cape in March 1710. At the Cape he was appointed assistant and junior merchant and progressed through the ranks to member of the council of policy in 1713 and in 1717, was given the rank of merchant. On the death of governor, Maurits Pasques de Chavonnes on 8 September 1724, De la Fontaine was appointed acting governor. He served in this capacity until 25 February 1727, when the new governor, Pieter Gysbert Noodt, assumed office. De la Fontaine then applied for discharge from the service of the VOC, but his request was rejected, and the company gave him a promotion to senior merchant and increased his salary substantially. When Noodt died in 1729, De la Fontaine again was appointed acting governor on 24 April 1729 and on 8 March 1730 the Lords XVII (Heren XVII) confirmed his appointment as governor and he took the oath on 21 March 1731. During his administration, De la Fontaine endeavoured to expand the Cape settlement into the interior. In July 1734, he travelled to the vicinity of Mossel Bay and although he thought little of the harbour, he claimed the bay for the VOC and proclaimed the Great Brak River as the eastern boundary of Cape. New outposts were also established in 1734, at Riviersonderend , at Rietvlei on the Buffeljags River, and at St Helena Bay. In 1736 De la Fontaine again asked to be released, in part because he wanted to ensure good education for his children. His request was granted and in August 1737 he handed his duties to his successor, Adriaan van Kervel. Personal De la Fontaine was the eldest of the four children of Jacques (Jacob) de la Fontaine and Barbara van der Burgh and was baptized in Amsterdam on 23 April 1684. At the Cape he married Maria Elisabeth de Man on 10 May 1711, who was born and died at the Cape and they had a son and a daughter. In February 1738, De la Fontaine and his family sailed for Holland, where he bought Westerhout, a farmstead at Wijk aan Zee and lived there until his death.

Beginning in mid-2020, the vaccine candidate was undergoing Phase III clinical research. On October 19, preliminary results from the Phase III trial in Brazil showed that CoronaVac appeared to be safe in providing protection against the Covid-19.  Testing  In a Phase II clinical trial completed in July 2020, CoronaVac showed immunogenicity at a low 3μg dose, providing 92.4% seroconversion in adults between age 18–59. In May, CoronaVac began Phase I & II trials in China on adults over the age 60, and in September CoronaVac began Phase I & II trials in China on children between age 3-17. Coronavac could remain stable for up to three years in storage, which might offer some advantage in vaccine distribution to regions where cold-chains are not developed. Latin America Phase III trials In late July 2020, Sinovac began conducting a Phase III vaccine trial to evaluate efficacy and safety on 9,000 volunteer health professionals in six states of Brazil, collaborating with Butantan Institute. On 9 September, governor of São Paulo João Doria said the Phase III trials of CoronaVac had shown promising preliminary results and that it may be available to Brazilians as early as December. On October 19, Butantan Institute said Coronavac proved to be safe after its two doses were applied to 9,000 volunteers, but Butantan director Dimas Covas said data on how effective the vaccine is in protecting people against COVID-19 would not be released until it has been tested on all 15,000 volunteers in expanded trials. Also in early August, a Phase III trial was started in Chile, headed by Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, which was expected to include 3,000 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65. Asia Phase III trials The Governor of West Java Ridwan Kamil participating in phase 3 trial of the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine in Indonesia. In August, Sinovac announced Phase III trials in Bangladesh with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research involving 4,200 volunteers. In October, it was reported the trials were stalled in Bangladesh after Sinovac requested the government to co-finance it. Bangladesh's National Research Ethics Committee member said the request was unusual, and the government \\"may not be in a position to invest money for this purpose\\". The Health Minister has emphasised Bangladesh will get CoronaVac, even if the trial does not go ahead. In August, Sinovac began a Phase III trials in Indonesia with Bio Farma in Bandung involving 1,620 volunteers. In September, the Philippines Department of Health announced five hospitals as possible sites for Phase III trials in the Philippines. In October, the Philippines Food and Drug Administration said Phase III trails could begin in November. On 16 September, Turkey began Phase III trials with 1,200-1,300 health workers to be vaccinated over the next 10 days with a second dose 14 days later. The vaccine trials would later be expanded to volunteers with chronic diseases, with the aim of vaccinating 13,000 people. Regulation and commercialization=Brazil On 23 September, governor João Doria said São Paulo was to start to immunize its population with Coronavac in mid-December. The state has a deal with Sinovac for 60 million doses to be delivered by the end of February, which Doria said is enough to vaccinate the state's entire population. Doria signed a $90 million contract with Sinovac to receive the initial 46 million doses of a potential vaccine, and said the state had a verbal agreement regarding the delivery of the remaining 14 million doses. On 2 October, the São Paulo government filed documents to health regulator Anvisa to register for use of CoronaVac. In early October, Doria said his government had already obtained 6 million CoronaVac doses for potential distribution.  Chile  In October, Chile Health Minister Enrique Paris signed an agreement with Sinovac to provide 20 million doses of Coronavac. The use of the vaccine required approval from a qualified agency, such as the Public Health Institute of Chile or ANVISA in Brazil. The Chilean government hoped ANVISA would approve Coronavac soon so that it could be used in Chile. China A 20,000 square meter production plant in Beijing has been built for manufacturing the Coronavac vaccine, with the facility planned to eventually produce 300 million doses a year, if the vaccine is successful and approved. In late August, CoronaVac was approved for emergency use as part of a program in China to vaccinate high-risk groups such as medical staff. In October, Jiaxing, Zhejiang began offering Coronavac to essential workers and other high-risk groups for 200 yuan ($29.75) per dose, as part of a two-dose regimen. Indonesia Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said a purchased agreement was signed with Sinovac for 50 million doses of the vaccine from November to March 2021. If the Indonesian trials are successful, Bio Farma plans to ramp up production to its maximum capacity of 250 million doses a year. Three million doses would be supplied directly by Sinovac in 2020, with 1.5 million doses to be delivered in the first week of November. Bio Farma confirmed the COVID-19 vaccine will be priced at around Rp 200,000 (US$13.57) per dose once available.

Biography = Early life and education  Moseley was born in 1865 in Union City Michigan, to a prohibitionist father, and a mother who was one of the first white children born on Hawaii. He was the maternal grandson of Hiram Bingham I and Sybil Moseley Bingham. He was a descendant of Myles Standish. He attended Union City High School, graduating in 1880, and attending a year of post graduation studies there before he was admitted to the University of Michigan, where he earned his masters of Arts in 1885. He paid for his education mostly through his own work, with the exception of $150 he was gifted from family.  Career  Members of Joseph Steere's 1887 Scientific Expedition From 1885 to 1887 Moseley taught in Grand Rapids, Michigan. A Female Chalcophaps indica collected by Moseley in 1887. Edwin Moseley was among the members of Joseph Steere's 1887 Scientific Expedition to areas in the Philippines, Hawaii, Japan, and China. Moseley became a teacher at Sandusky High School in Sandusky, Ohio in 1889, where following a tour of European museums in 1890, he founded a natural history museum at the school in January 1891. Between 1901 and 1904 he and 100 of his students surveyed the Sandusky Bay by probing the bed with Augers during the winter, and recording the amount of glacial till unearthed. In 1905 Mosley conducted experiments on school animals including cats, a dog, rabbits, and sheep by feeding them food including Eupatorium rugosum then published and disseminated how it caused Milk sickness in a formal paper presented to the Ohio Academy of Sciences that year, with his work in this area being valued by Charles C. Deam. A 1919 article in the The Journal of Infectious Diseases identified this as the first organized systematic experiment conducted on the issue. In 1914 Moseley became one of the first faculty at Bowling Green Normal College, where he served as head of the Biology Department until retirement in 1936. During his retirement Moseley wrote about a link between solar events and dendrochronology. His work in weather forecasting was recognized by the New York Times. In 1943 Mosley was awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters by Bowling Green State University. On April 28, 1948 in Dayton, Ohio, Moseley became ill; later dying on June 6, 1948 to Coronary thrombosis. His will dedicated his estate, worth between $50,000 and $100,000 at the time of death, to create scholarships for students.  Publications  Moseley wrote Trees, Stars, and Birds, which was published in 1920 and featured illustrations by Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Moseley wrote Other Worlds, a book on Astronomy published by The Appleton Century Company. The book was praised in a 1933 review published by the New York Times for its clear presentation of subject matter. The book was criticized by James Stokley in The Journal of the Franklin Institute for containing a number of inaccuracies known at the time. The book grew out of an earlier article published in Scientific American, which speculated on the possibility of Extraterrestrial life.  Personal life  Moseley abstained from a number of substances, believing alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and opium to be particularly harmful. He also publicly admonished students working in chemistry labs for gaining a chloroform habit. Moseley had a number of frugal habits, such as making tomato soup from ketchup and hot water. He was known to avoid buying new clothes, and frequently wore a single blue suit made of Serge that had received so much wear the fabric had become shiny. During World War II, Moseley served as a local representative of the Russian War Relief agency in Bowling Green, Ohio, and solicited donations for Russian war refugees. Moseley promoted the conservation of Barn Owls.

It is a cultural and intellectual history of Jesus as envisioned by various left-wing radicals in the United States from the mid-nineteenth century to World War I. The book received positive critical reviews.  Content  Among those who were fascinated by the radical Jesus were freethinkers, unionists, socialists, and anarchists, but the concept had little appeal to mainline Protestants, African-Americans, or Catholics. Burns also emphasizes division between Social Gospel and Christian socialists from \\"radical religionists\\" who emphasized Jesus as a human, political figure and rejected his divinity, as well as between those who were genuinely inspired by the story of Jesus versus those who appropriated Jesus to support their causes. Among the figures analyzed by the book are abolitionists Ernest Renan and Frederick Douglass, religious dissenters such as Robert Ingersoll and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. In the second chapter socialist conceptions of Jesus by George Herron and Cyrenus Ward are discussed, as well as religious conflict within the Socialist Party. Theologian Bouck White and his influential The Call of the Carpenter, which depicts Jesus as a revolutionary figure campaigning against Roman imperialism and greed, are discussed in two chapters. The last chapter discusses Eugene Debs, who, Burns argues, draws heavily on the radical Jesus tradition. The actors who created the \\"radical historical Jesus\\" acknowledged that their representation was imagined even while arguing that it was historically correct. Reception Reviewer Janine Drake writes that the book is a \\"giant step forward for the field of working class intellectual history\\", and that Burns \\"deserves the highest praise\\" for \\"crafting a deeply compelling and very readable narrative from scattered biographies, published writings, and newspapers\\". Patricia Appelbaum writes that the book is \\"a valuable contribution to the literature on American constructions of Jesus\\" and praises Burns for choosing an understudied topic. Sean McCloud found the book a \\"solid contribution to American studies, American religious history, and American labor history\\". According to David Mihalyfy, Burns' \\"major argument—that an extra-academic radical historical Jesus strode through the United States around the turn of the twentieth century—is important and simply indisputable.\\" References Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about Jesus Category:English-language books Category:Historical perspectives on Jesus Category:Oxford University Press books ","title":"The Life and Death of the Radical Historical Jesus"},{"id":"65085870","text":"Paul Edwin Bielenberg Sorensen (1891–1983) was a Danish-born Australian landscape gardener and nurseryman.

Early life Paul Sorensen was born on 16 December 1891 at Frederiksberg, a town now part of the urban area of Copenhagen, Denmark, which is the site of two extensive public gardens, Frederiksberg Gardens and Søndermarken. Sorensen was employed at a Copenhagen nursery, Hørsholm Planteskole, at the age of thirteen. He enrolled at the Hørsholm Tekniske Skole to study horticulture. For the last two years of this training, Sorensen was under the direction of Lars Nielsen, a leading horticulturist, who at that time was responsible for the design of much of the open spaces of Copenhagen. During that same period, Sorensen did garden maintenance work at Hvidøre, which at that time was a summer residence owned by King Christian IX's daughters, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom and Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia. After performing national service, he worked in Germany, France, and Switzerland. He was employed by the landscape designers and contractors Mertens Bros. Sorensen was later to state that it was the outbreak of the First World War (although his homeland Denmark was neutral) that motivated him to migrate to Australia, when he saw his French, German, Austrian, and Italian friends in Switzerland being recalled to their homelands for military service. Career in Australia Sorensen arrived in Australia in 1915. He initially found employment as a farmhand in Victoria, prior to getting work at Ormond Plant Farm propagating ferns. He moved to the Blue Mountains and obtained work as a gardener at the Carrington Hotel at Katoomba. He opened a plant nursery, called Sorensen's Nursery, at Katoomba, before moving the business in 1920 to Leura, a nearby mountain village that would become his lifelong home. \\"Leuralla\\" at Leura, N.S.W. Initially maintaining existing gardens, Sorensen was soon planting large gardens for wealthy people who had homes in the Blue Mountains. During the 1920s, he created gardens in the area for the residences \\"Sylvan Mists\\", \\"Gabo\\", \\"La Vista\\" at Wentworth Falls, \\"Dean [or Dene] Park\\", and \\"Cheppen\\". Sorensen assisted Lady Fairfax, the widow of the Sydney newspaper magnate Sir James Oswald Fairfax (1863–1928), with the garden of \\"Sospel\\" at Leura. He also improved an existing garden in Leura, \\"Leuralla\\". Sorensen's garden designs influenced other gardens in the Blue Mountains, such as \\"Benison\\", at Leura. Sorensen redesigned and expanded an existing garden at \\"Mahratta\\" at Wahroonga, in 1925 for its then owner, Gerald Allen of the mercantile firm Samuel Allen & Sons. After 1930, Sorensen also worked for the next owner of \\"Mahratta\\", James Joynton Smith who, as owner of the Carrington Hotel, had given Sorensen his first work in Australia as a gardener. In 1932, he started a garden at \\"Heaton Lodge\\", Mudgee, for the Lonergan family, owners of the town's department store; this was the first garden that he created in an area of relatively low rainfall. \\"Invergowrie\\" viewed from Bundanoon Road, Exeter, N.S.W. - Part of the garden with house in the background. (Sept. 2020) In 1933, Sorensen met Henri van der Velde, a Belgian-born manufacturer and the owner of Feltex Carpets, who had a vision for a garden at \\"Everglades\\", Leura; this garden would become probably Sorensen's best known. During the 1930s, Sorensen worked for seed supplier Anderson & Co in garden design, while keeping his private clients. In 1934, he donated his time, plants and materials to laying out the memorial garden and stone flagging at the War Memorial Hall—now the Country Women's Association Hall—at Leura. Industrialist Sir Cecil Hoskins, who also had a passion for gardens, became a client and lifelong friend. Sorensen designed and planted the garden of Hoskins' newly- built home, \\"Invergowrie\\", at Exeter (1936). \\"Invergowrie\\" was built on land Hoskins had bought from the estate of Arthur Yates in 1929. In making the new garden, Sorensen was able to make use of some mature trees, hedgerows, beds of daffodils, and orchards planted during Yates' ownership, but photographs taken at the time show the area in front of the house was newly-planted and almost all of the large garden was his work. The association with Cecil Hoskins led to other garden projects, mainly in the Illawarra and Southern Highlands; \\"Gleniffer Brae\\", in Wollongong, for Cecil's brother Sidney Hoskins; \\"Green Hills\\" and \\"Hillside\\" executive housing for Australian Iron & Steel; and the Hoskins Memorial Church at Lithgow. He also created the gardens for \\"Redlands\\" at Mittagong. Most of the gardens that Sorensen designed and built were for residences. Noteworthy exceptions were the rooftop garden that he created at Feltex House (an office building) or Henri van der Velde, in 1939, and three garden projects associated with the Hoskins family; the Mount Keira Scout Camp; the garden landscaped surroundings of the Southern Portland Cement Ltd's cement plant, near Berrima; and a Remembrance Drive of memorial tree plantings along the Old Hume Highway south of Berrima. Surviving tree plantings at \\"Gleniffer Brae\\".In 1939, by now doing significant work in the Southern Highlands and Illawarra areas, he set up a second nursery at Berrima, which operated until 1944. At \\"Mahratta\\" in Wahroonga, he redesigned and renovated his earlier garden to suit a new art deco style mansion built there for Thomas Alfred (T.A.) Field, a wealthy grazier and meat merchant, in 1941. Also in the 1940s, he created a cool climate garden for \\"The Braes\\" at Leura. Sorensen became friendly with Lady Gowrie, wife of the Earl of Gowrie, Governor-General of Australia, and he assisted in the creation of a small garden at \\"Yarralumla\\" (Government House, Canberra), in memory of the Gowries' son, Patrick, who died on active service during the Second World War. Two of Sorensen's own sons died in the war and Cecil Hoskins invited Sorensen to erect a memorial to them in the grounds of the Hoskins Memorial Church at Lithgow; he created a simple memorial, using natural rock. After the war, he constructed mainly smaller gardens, for country properties—including \\"Bethune\\" near Orange—and for houses in the Blue Mountains and on the Upper North Shore in Sydney. He returned to \\"Everglades\\"—from 1962 a National Trust of Australia (NSW) property—and expanded the garden. and to \\"Mahratta\\", where he renovated the garden for its new owners—Bank of New South Wales—in 1964. He did work at the country estate of the Field family, Lanyon Homestead, in the A.C.T. Also in the A.C.T. he carried out tree surgery that saved some very old cedar trees at \\"Yarralumla\\". In the late 1960s, he also returned to \\"Invergowrie\\" and restored and extended the garden for its new owners. He also designed and constructed new gardens for \\"Mereworth House\\" at Berrima, in 1965, and \\"Fernhill\\" at Mulgoa in 1969. Such large commissions became rarer; the era of grand residences with extensive parkland gardens was largely over by the 1960s. 261x261px Sorensen kept working until his death in 1983, with his younger son and grandson doing the heavier work. Personal life and death On 27 November 1919, Sorensen married Anna Ernestena Hillenberg.N.S.W. Marriage Certificate Reg. No. 11760/1919 They had three sons, two of whom—Derrick and Neville—died during their service in the Second World War. Sorensen died on 12 September 1983, at his home at Leura. He wanted his ashes returned to Europe and scattered in the North Sea. His younger son, Ib Sorensen, was also a landscape gardener and carried on the business, finally selling the Sorensen's Nursery in 1988. Naturalistic \\"grotto pool\\" at \\"Everglades\\".  Legacy  Sorensen's main legacies are those of his gardens that survive to this day. He is best known for \\"Everglades\\" at Leura but he built over 100 gardens during his career. Unfortunately, some of his gardens have been lost, reduced in size, or neglected. Many of his remaining gardens are at risk from subdivision and other modern urban developments such as road widening. Sorensen's rooftop garden at Feltex House, Sydney, was lost when it was converted to office space in 1954; the original three-storey art deco style building was extended to nine storeys in 1961. A part of his garden \\"Gleniffer Brae\\" is now the Wollongong Botanic Garden, although changes made as a public park have masked much of the original garden's design. At \\"The Braes\\", the removal of large trees and other changes have altered the microclimate and compromised the aesthetics of the garden. \\"Invergowrie\\" retains a large garden by modern standards but due to some sub-division of the land is of reduced extent. A number of his surviving gardens are heritage listed. The garden of the Mount Kiera Scout Camp is one of the best maintained surviving examples of his garden designs but is not heritage listed.\\"Mahratta\\", Wahroonga - Driveway and part of the garden. Sorensen's other legacies are his techniques for creating gardens and his approach to garden design, both of which were influential. He developed techniques for enhancing the sandy soils of the Blue Mountains, so that these soils could support luxuriant gardens. At \\"Gleniffer Brae\\", he transplanted, from the surrounding bushland, several large Illawarra flame trees—reputedly one of the earliest successful transplantings of mature Australian native trees, something still seen as very difficult to do. Sorensen understood the difficulties of creating and maintaining large landscaped gardens in Australia, an extremely dry continent, saying that in Australia the approach should be \\"don't buy land, buy water\\". Sorensen's approach to landscape garden design, although based in the European tradition, was influenced by the Australian landscape. He saw the most important elements of gardens as being trees and larger shrubs. He used mainly exotic plants in his Australian gardens, but his terracing, stone walls, and other features were typically less formal and conventional than those of earlier garden designers.A signature feature was stone walling using local rock that may have been split or broken to shape but not noticeably cut with straight edges. He made use of the surrounding outlooks and natural vegetation and he did use large native trees—such as the Illawarra flame trees and coastal cypress pine at \\"Gleniffer Brae\\"—when and where it suited his design. In the garden of \\"Mahratta\\", he mixed native trees with exotics. At \\"Everglades\\", he created a small waterfall and \\"grotto pool\\" of natural appearance—clearly influenced by the natural watercourses of the Blue Mountains—and the garden has a lookout overlooking Gordon Falls and the Jamison Valley Similarly, at \\"Leuralla\\", the garden overlooks the Jamison Valley. At \\"Gleniffer Brae\\", the garden framed views of nearby Mount Kiera and at Mt Kiera Scout Camp, he made advantage of distant views to the ocean. However, Sorensen planned his gardens so that plantings screened views and other features, which were gradually revealed only by moving through the garden space. Although he planned a garden with its final landscape form in mind, Sorensen anticipated the development of the garden over a long period of time, during which its nature would vary as it matured; the aim was to allow the garden to achieve its own ecological equilibrium, after which only relatively little maintenance would be needed. This notion of planning for continuing change and development, over many years, was a novel and very unusual approach, when Sorensen began his work.

Early life Baker was born on August 6, 1893 on Long Island in Lawrence, New York. He was the son of Stephen Baker (1859–1946) and Mary Dabney (née Payson) Baker (1865–1948), who married in 1890. His father served as president and chairman of the board of the Bank of the Manhattan Company, the earliest predecessor of Chase Bank, and an associate of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. His paternal grandparents were Anna Mary (née Greene) Baker and Stephen Baker, a Republican U.S. Representative from New York during the Civil War who made a fortune as an importer of woolen goods and was a son of Stephen Baker, a merchant who was one of the original stockholders in the Manhattan Company, founded by Aaron Burr in 1799. His maternal grandparents were Francis Payson and Mary (née Dabney) Payson. His uncle was noted author and publisher William Farquhar Payson. Baker graduated from Princeton University in 1915. After leaving Princeton, he joined the Bankers Trust Company as a bank messenger before being assigned to work in the trust department. At the outbreak of World War I, he joined the U.S. Navy as an ensign. He was discharged in January 1919. Career After the war, he joined the Bank of the Manhattan Company where his father was president, becoming an assistant cashier in the Union Square office of the bank in 1919 before being elected a vice president the following year. In 1922, he was elected a director of the Bank and moved to the main office at 40 Wall Street, serving in the Trust department. In 1927, after thirty-four years as president, his father turned the presidency and a considerable stock ownership to the younger Baker who had just turned thirty- four. Within a year of assuming the presidency, Baker acquired the Flushing National Bank, the Bayside National Bank, the Queens-Bellaire Bank, the First National Bank of Whitestone, the Bronx Borough Bank, and the First National Bank of Brooklyn. The acquisitions led to the bank having sixty-one offices throughout New York City. In December 1928, Baker guided the 129-year-old Bank of the Manhattan Company to a joint affiliation with the International Acceptance Bank, Inc., which had been organized in 1921 by Paul Warburg. Each institution retained their corporate identities, but have the Bank of the Manhattan Company shareholders owned the stock of the International Acceptance Bank. In 1932, he was chosen as chairman of the board and served in that role until March 31, 1955 when the Bank of the Manhattan Company merged with the Chase National Bank to form the second-largest commercial banking institution in the country. Baker became president and chairman of the executive committee of the merged institution which started out with deposits in excess of $6.8 billion. He retired on December 31, 1957 but continued as a director of Chase Manhattan until August 11, 1965. In 1953, he was elected president of the St. Luke's Hospital board of trustees. Personal life In 1915, Baker was married to Marianne Lathrop Foote (1894–1992), a daughter of Robert Dumont Foote and Marie Gilmour (née Hopkins) Foote. In 1933, they leased a large duplex apartment at 770 Park Avenue, the Rosario Candela designed luxury apartment building.

It was apparently founded around the time of the ICRC's inception in 1863. The library in its self-description is \\"the leading documentary resource\\" on the ICRC in particular and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) in general, along with the ICRC Archives. It plays a central role for the mandate of the ICRC according to article 4 (g) of its statutes > \\"to work for the understanding and dissemination of knowledge of > international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and to prepare > any development thereof\\".  History = The early period: Ancien Fonds  alt= The ICRC - or rather its predecessor, the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded - was founded in February 1863 in Geneva by five men: businessman-turned-activist Henry Dunant, who had laid out the basic ideas in his much-acclaimed book A Memory of Solferino; lawyer and philanthropist Gustave Moynier; the medical doctors Louis Appia and Théodor Maunoir; and the General Guillaume Henri Dufour. The exact date of the creation of the library is unknown. It is first mentioned in the records of 1875, but > \\"we may suppose that it was born at the same time as the organization, > initially perhaps simply taking the form of a collection of works belonging > to the Committee’s founders.\\" The actual address of the newly founded Red Cross - and thus at least a part of its fledgling library - became Dunant's private residence, the third floor of his family's \\"Maison Diodati\\" in the Old Town at Rue du Puits-Saint-Pierre 4. However, as Dunant's colonial businesses in Algeria collapsed, he declared bankruptcy in 1867 and was pushed out of the ICRC by its president Moynier in the following year. It may be assumed that Dunant's collection of ICRC-related publications was transferred to Moynier's splendid city residence in Rue de l'Athénée No. 8, since he was clearly the driving force behind the creation of a library. In 1871, the ICRC moved into an apartment of a building at Rue de l'Athénée No. 3, just across the street from Moynier's splendid town residence in Rue de l'Athénée No. 8. While it was a very representative address, the office spaces were still rather modest with just three rooms. One of them served both as library and museum. In 1878, Moynier declared that the library should be accessible to all. In the same year he completely reorganized its collections and wrote himself by a hand a new catalog. > \\"The Heritage Collection remains to this day organized according to the > classification system that he set up. Items are shelved first by source, > then by subject, author and date of publication. This classification system > makes it possible to follow the spread of Red Cross action across the world > and the creation of a network of National Societies first in Europe and then > further afield. The largest number of items in the Heritage Collection come > from Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. As well, > the Collection includes publications from China, Cuba, Brazil, the United > States and Mexico, and even one from a short-lived micro-nation, the Free > State of Counani.\\" As the Red Cross movement and the collections of its library expanded, the aging Moynier delegated some administrative tasks like the management of the library upon the recommendation of his nephew and future successor, Gustave Ador, to Paul Des Gouttes, a lawyer, who was appointed the secretary of the Committee in 1898. He was a nephew of Moynier's as well.  Post-World War I  Étienne Clouzot during WWI at the musée Rath, where he also published a news bulletin for the International Prisoners of War Agency Shortly after the end of the First World War, the ICRC moved to its new headquarters at the Promenade du Pin at the edge of the Old Town. The library was accommodated there next to a large vestibule. The responsibility for the library was now taken over by Étienne Clouzot, an archivist palaeographer, who was also a columnist for the liberal daily newspaper Journal de Genève. During WWI he had designed the classification system for the millions of index cards. In 1919 he succeeded Des Gouttes as head of the ICRC Secretariat and in that position gave the library a great boost, especially by establishing a systematic exchange of publications with the national societies of the Red Cross Movement. In June 1933, the ICRC moved its headquarters away from the Old Town and - \\"by a curious turn in history\\" - into the splendid Villa Moynier in the quarter of Sécheron. It had been built in 1848 for the banker Barthélemy Paccard and was then owned by his son-in-law Gustave Moynier, who had stayed in that office for a record-term of 47 years until his death in 1910. Situated in the middle of the large Parc Moynier on the shores of Lake Geneva, the Villa had housed the League of Nations in 1926. The city of Geneva then acquired it and rented it out to the ICRC. A room on the ground floor was reserved for the library next to the museum room and the meeting hall. However, this \\"eccentric\\" location and a lack of staff assigned to it made the library effectively dormant.  Post-World War II  In 1946 the ICRC moved its headquarters from the Villa Moynier to the former Carlton Hotel in the quarter of Pregny. The neoclassical building on a hill above the Palace of Nations was provided to the organisation by the Canton of Geneva through a long-term lease. The library was assigned a \\"modest\\" place. Two years later, in 1948, the new collection, which had been added to the Heritage Collection since 1919, was completely reorganised and catalogued. However, it was only a quarter of a century later, in 1972, that the governing body of the ICRC assigned a more prominent room to the library. At the same time, it raised its status and confirmed the mandate to not only preserve Red Cross publications, but also to comprehensively acquire IHL publications. Ten years later, a thesaurus-based reference system was introduced which allowed users easier access to documents. In 1987, the library moved into the newly constructed building no. 3 (level -2) next to the Carlton. Two years later, a computerised catalogue system was established.  Post-1990  The first computer with internet access was introduced in the reading hall in 1995. Five years later, the library catalogue became accessible through the intranet. Since 2010, the ICRC Library, public archives and audiovisual archives have become part of the same unit, under the umbrella of the ICRC Archives and Information Management service. This administrative reform is part of the efforts to cope with the growing complexity of big data and at the same time the fragmentation of information due to the rapid evolution of digital technologies.  Collections and Holdings  The reading room with a poster of Dunant on the right The heritage collection of the ancien fonds (Signature: AF) comprises almost 4,000 books, brochures, reports, manuals and press cuttings from over forty countries. Some members of the ICRC, first and foremost Gustave Moynier, contributed books from their private holdings to the library. The collection of Paul Des Gouttes was donated after his death in 1943 by his widow, including a copy of Un souvenir de Solférino from the first edition, which Dunant had limited to a total of 100 copies. The library collections are constantly updated with new acquisitions covering IHL and the work of the organization. As of early 2020, the ICRC library counted some 41,000 references in its catalogue. They include: > \\"preparatory documents, reports, records and minutes of Diplomatic > Conferences where the main IHL treaties were adopted; records of Red Cross > and Red Crescent Movement conferences, during which many IHL matters are > discussed; every issue of the International Review of the Red Cross since it > was founded; all ICRC publications; rare documents published in the period > between the founding of ICRC and the end of the First World War and charting > the influence of Dunant’s ideas; and a unique collection of legislation and > case law implementing IHL at domestic level.\\"  Galleries = The Heritage Collection  File:Titre PremierCatalogue BibliothèqueDuComitéDeLaCroixRouge GustaveMoynier.jpg File:ICRC-Library Ancien-Fonds.jpg File:ICRC-Library AncienFonds.jpg File:ICRC-Library HeritageCollection.jpg File:ICRC-Library HeritageCollection 02.jpg File:ICRC- Library HeritageCollection 04.jpg File:ICRC-Library HeritageCollection 01.jpg File:ICRC-Library HeritageCollection 03.jpg File:BibliothèqueDuComitéDeLaCroixRouge PremierCatalogue GustaveMoynier.jpgCover of Moynier's handwritten catalog File:ICRC-Library Catalog-HeritageCollection GustaveMoynier Suisse.jpgList of publications from Switzerland in the catalog File:ICRC-Library HeritageCollection-Catalog- GustaveMoynier.jpgList of Moynier's own publications File:ICRC-Library LouisAppia 1859.jpg1859 book by co-founder Louis Appia File:ICRC-Library HenryDunant UnSouvenurDeSolferino-1stEdition.jpgFirst edition of \\"Un Souvenir de Solferino\\" by Dunant File:ICRC-Library SecoursAuxBlessés1864-LouisAppia RapportSchleswig.jpg1864 report by Appia on the Second Schleswig War as first ICRC delegate ever File:Bibliotheque du CICR - Conférence internationale pour la neutralisation du service de santé militaire en campagne.jpgProceedings of the 1864 conference that led to the First Geneva Convention File:ICRC-Library LivreRouge Counani1903.jpg1903 \\"LIVRE ROUGE\\" by the government of Counani  POW journals from WWI  File:ICRC-Library BulletinPourLesPrisonniersFrançaisEnAllemagne no2 26091914.jpg File:ICRC- Library EchoDuCampDeRennbahnMünster no5 08071916.jpg File:ICRC-Library LeTasDeBlagues CampDeSchneidemühl no28 20091917.jpg File:ICRC-Library LeCanar JournalsDesPrisonniersDe Guerre WWI no19 21101917.jpg File:ICRC-Library Baracke07011917.jpg File:ICRC-Library Baracke08041917.jpg File:ICRC-Library Baracke17121916.jpg File:ICRC-Library LesCampsDuHanovre-No2 25041915.jpg File:ICRC-Library LeFlambeau No18 12111916.jpg File:ICRC-Library LePourEtLeContre-No4 06081916.jpg File:ICRC-Library L-Intermede No74 22061918.jpg File:ICRC-Library L-Intermede No61 0501918.jpg File:ICRC-Library L-Intermede Noel1917.jpg File:ICRC-Library LeMessagerDuPrisonnierDeGuerre No9 Mars1916.jpg File:ICRC-Library DerSonntagsbote No25 1916.jpg File:ICRC-Library TheWoodenCity No11 01121915.jpg  Stamps  File:ICRC-Library ComitéInternationalDeSecoursAuxBlessés-1864-Stamp.jpg File:ICRC-Library IPWA WWI MuseeRath Stamp.jpg File:ICRC-Library-stamp PaulDesGouttes.jpg File:ICRC- Library-stamp BIBL-CICR.jpg File:ICRC-Library-stamp post1945.jpg  Autographs  File:ICRC-Library GustaveMoynier Signature1864.jpgGustave Moynier File:ICRC-Library Signature ReneeMargueriteCramer IPWA.jpgRenée- Marguerite Cramer, the first ever female Committee member File:ICRC-Library RaphaelLemkin-DedicationTo MaxHuber.jpg1945 dedication by Raphael Lemkin, who defined the term Genocide, to ICRC president Max Huber File:ICRC-Library JER- Wood Detour-TheStoryOfOflagIVC-dedication-to-MaxHuber.jpg1946 dedication by JER Wood to Huber \\"whose parcels saved our bacon.\\"  See also  * List of libraries in Switzerland  References  External links  *CROSS-files - blog promoting the contents of ICRC Audiovisual archives, Library collections, General Archives and Agency Archives *@ICRC_library on Twitter *Online Catalog Category:Libraries in Switzerland Category:International humanitarian law ","title":"International Committee of the Red Cross Library"},{"id":"65086114","text":"Trevon Allen (born February 16, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for Starogard Gdański of the Polish Basketball League.

Born in 1855 in Montevideo. He was son of Pere Palay and Antònia Jaurés, a couple from Catalonia who emigrated to Uruguay. They returned in 1858 and established the first cookie factory of Spain in Badalona. Joaquim was put in charge of the business along his brother Emili in 1889 and enjoyed a good period of solds thank to the high demand of the Spanish colonies in America, however with its lost in 1898 the factory had losses and closed at the beginning of the new century. In the political sphere, he was supporter and local representative of the Conservative Party in Badalona. Palay has been considered and introductor of caciquism. During his leadership of the conservatives of Badalona he was the main antagonist of the liberal counterpart, Pere Renom. He acted as mayor of Badalona in two periods, during the second term in 1897 Badalona received the title of city. After this and the second mayoralty of Renom, he was elected again as councilor in 1899. However, he starred violent confrontations with Pere Renom followers. This confrontations had their peak in July 1, when Palay was going to become the new mayor. That day Palay was attacked by a sereno in the entrance of the town hall, and the tension between conservative and liberal supporters explode and they fought in the town square. As a result, were twenty injuries and three deaths. The civil governor decided to suspend the city councilers and the conflict was brought to trial that lasted until 1904, when Palay was found guilty of exciting his followers to attack the liberals. After 1899, the city council was dominated by mayors and councilors followers of Palay, starting a period of chaos in local government that ended with an administrative inspection from the civil governor, who suspended the city council in 1905.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also: list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States.  Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * Fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization. * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars. * Liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel). * Releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post-incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are re-purposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986–2001, 2002–2009, and 2010–2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1977: * On January 2, a gas pipeline ruptured and burned near Nursery, Texas. Some power poles were destroyed, but there were no injuries. * On January 5, in Fairview, New Jersey, a circumferential break on a 6-inch cast iron gas pipe. The released gas then migrated under frozen soil & a sidewalk, into an area under the floor of a building. The gas later was ignited by an unknown source, causing an explosion that killed 1 person, injured 13 others, and destroyed 3 buildings. * In Baltimore, Maryland on January 13, a 4-inch cast iron gas line suffered a circumferential break. The gas migrated under frozen soil and pavement into nearby rowhouses, and was likely ignited by an oil burned motor. One person was killed. * On January 18, an 18-inch steel gas main failed and leaked into an electrical and telephone conduit in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Three explosion followed, destroying 5 buildings, and breaking windows nearby. Improper pipeline construction techniques were the cause of the failure. There were no injuries. * A gas pipeline exploded and burned in Stockton, California on February 4, four days after another gas pipeline fire nearby. There were no injuries. * On May 20, fire broke out at a MAPCO pipeline pumping stations and Terminal in Ogden, Iowa, threatening 4 propane storage tanks for a time. There were no injuries. * In June, a Williams Partners pipeline terminal near Lawrence, Kansas spilled about 33,600 gallons of gasoline. the next spring, a rancher nearby was still having gasoline entering a creek on his property. * An explosion on July 8 at Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Pump Station No. 8 kills one worker, injures 5 others, and destroys the pump station. Over $2 million in damage was done. A US House of Representatives Committee later announced the cause was workers not following the proper procedures, causing crude oil to flow into a pump under repair at the time. * On July 19, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System pipeline was shut down for the 4th time in a month, when it was hit in a valve by a front loader. More than of crude oil was spilled. * A 12-inch propane pipeline ruptured near Ruff Creek, in Greene County, Pennsylvania, from stress corrosion cracking, on July 20. The resulting propane vapor cloud ignited, when a truck that was driven into the cloud stalled, then created a spark, when it was restarted. The two men in the truck were killed, as well as 57 head of cattle, along with destruction of power lines and wooded areas. Subsidence of underground coal mines in the area may have hastened the failure. * A cast iron gas main broke in Cherokee, Alabama on July 30. Gas migrated into a home through a recently back filled sewer line trench, and exploded 5 days later. * In August, a car drove through leaking liquid from a petroleum pipeline in Lakewood, California. The pooled liquid appeared to be mud, but it exploded and burned, injuring a woman in the car. * On August 9, natural gas under 20 psi pressure entered a 6-ounce per square inch gas distribution system in El Paso, Texas, over pressuring 750 gas customer customers. Numerous small fires resulted from this. The cause was an error during gas pipeline replacement. * On August 15, crude oil spilled at Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Pump Station No. 9. There was no fire, but a fire or explosion at that station could have shut down that pipeline, since Pump Station No. 8 was out of service from the previous month's accident there. This was the seventh accident on this pipeline since the start up of the Alaska pipeline on June 20, 1977. The NTSB released three recommendations on September 9, 1977, to correct certain design and operating deficiencies in the pump rooms of each station of the Alyeska system. * A gas transmission pipeline exploded, forcing hundreds to evacuate in Columbus, Indiana on August 26. There was no fire or injuries. * On September 5, 2 brothers in a moving truck drove into a vapor cloud from a leak at a gas compressor plant in New Cuyama, California, igniting the cloud. One was killed immediately, and the other died 11 days later. * On September 10, a pipeline rupture spilled of gasoline into a creek in Toledo, Ohio. Corrosion of the pipeline caused the failure. * A gas line inside a building in San Francisco, California leaked and exploded, injuring 7 and heavily damaging that building. Gas repair crews were working on the line at the time. * On October 12, a bulldozer ruptured a propane pipeline near Albany, Georgia, causing nearby train traffic to be halted. The bulldozer engine was left running, nearly igniting the vapors. * On October 30, a bulldozer hit a gas pipeline in Shreveport, Louisiana. The gas ignited, causing a 100 foot tall flame, injuring 4 people. * A backhoe being used to install a pipeline hit an adjacent 6-inch propane pipeline on November 21 in Hutchinson, Kansas. Fire broke out, but there were no injuries. * Construction workers punctured a 12-inch gas pipeline in Atlanta, Georgia, with an I-beam on December 1. No fire or explosion followed, but thousands of people were evacuated from nearby buildings. * On December 10, a 2-inch plastic gas main cracked and migrated under a paved parking area in Tempe, Arizona. The gas reached a building 35 feet away from the leak, where it was ignited by a cigarette. The explosion and fire that followed killed 2 people, and injured 3 others. Investigations showed the main had been damaged previous, and had been repaired by applying a piece of tape, by a non-gas company person. * A compression coupling joint between a plastic and a steel gas line pulled apart in Lawrence, Kansas on December 15. The gas migrated into 2 buildings, and exploded, killing 2 people, and injuring 3 others.

History The area occupied by the street lay within the walls of Roman Eboracum, but the route was not established until later. The York Civic Trust claims that it emerged in the Anglian period, as a shortcut between the Porta Principalis Dextra and the Porta Praetoria, now St Helen's Square and Bootham Bar. The street was first recorded in the 1150s. There are three main theories of the origin of its name: that \\"Blake\\" comes from the words for \\"white\\" or \\"bleaching\\", or from the Viking name \\"Bleiki\\". The church of St Wilfrid, Blake Street, was first mentioned in the 1140s, and lay in the middle of the western side of the street. It was demolished in 1585, and for religious purposes the street thereafter fell into the parish of St Michael le Belfrey, although the civil parish survived until 1900. The main entrance to St Leonard's Hospital lay opposite the northern end of the street, and by 1215, it owned several properties on the street. A survey of 1230 shows that Whitby Abbey owned several others. During the Georgian period, the street was the departure point for stagecoaches to the north. In 1732, the York Assembly Rooms opened on the west side of the street, and these survive. An open area to their north was created in 1735, and this was sometimes known as \\"Blake's Square\\". In 1827, baths were opened on the street. The street now forms part of the city's central shopping area. It was pedestrianised in 2020. Architecture and layout The northern end of Blake Street, looking north The street runs north from St Helen's Square to the junction of Museum Street, Duncombe Place, and St Leonard's Place. Until the creation of St Helen's Square, in 1745, it started at a junction with Stonegate, while a footpath across the graveyard of St Helen, Stonegate, connected it to Davygate. Other than the Assembly Rooms, the most notable buildings on the west side of the street are 18 Blake Street, built in 1789, while on the east side, numbers 1 to 5 originate from the 16th- century, 11 and 13 Blake Street were both built about 1750, and 15-21 were built by Thomas Haxby in 1773. 23 and 25 Blake Street are both late-18th century.
