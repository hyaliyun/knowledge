Published in four parts between 1917 and 1933, It has been described as Sarat Chandra's 'masterpiece'. The novel takes its title after the name of its protagonist, Srikanta, who lives the life of a wanderer.  Background  In a conversation, Sarat Chandra revealed that the book is partly autobiographical, and his own life experiences provided the basis for the experiences of the protagonist Srikanta; however, he added a caveat: Although not a travelogue, the book is described as involving journeys—both physical and spiritual. On being asked whether he considered Srikanta to be a travelogue, an autobiography, or a novel, Sarat Chandra's reply was: \\"A collection of scattered memories−nothing else.\\" Publication history Spanned in four parts, Srikanta was written over a period of more than sixteen years. The first three parts, except the last three chapters of third part, were serialized in a monthly magazine Bharatbarsha, under the title Srikantar Bhraman Kahini ( The Tale of Srikanta's Wanderings). While the fourth part was serialized in another monthly magazine Bichitra, with a slightly-changed name Srikanta Chaturtha Parba. The first three parts of the novel were published as a book, with the modified title, in 1917, 1918 and 1927 respectively. The fourth was published as a book in 1933 with the short title Srikanta, and was acclaimed as the great work of Sarat Chandra. Plot Set in sometime between late 19th-century to early 20th century, the story occurs in different regions of British India — Bhagalpur, Patna, Rangoon, Sainthia (Birbhum) and Debanandapur (Hooghly). ;Part I While living in his uncle's house, Srikanta, a boy, one day, meets Indranath, a boy of his age, during a football match and from that time, they become close friends. Srikanta accompanies Indranath in his daring adventures. Indranath loves and helps with money an outcast woman named Annadadidi, wife of a bohemian snake-charmer. Srikanta also comes to close to Annadadidi. Meanwhile Annadadidi's husbuand dies of snake-bite leaving her alone, one day she disappears from the scene Indranath also goes away one day and is never seen again. In course of time, Srikanta by chance meets a princely friend of his and goes out on a hunting expedition. There in the prince's tent, he meets Piyari, a nautch (dance) girl, who is none other than his old and dear schoolmate. Her real name is Rajlakshmi. She has not forgotten her old love which grows more intense while meeting Srikanta. After leaving the hunting party, Srikanta, the vagabond that he is, joins a group of roving mendicants. During the travelling Srikanta falls ill, and with some difficulty he sends news of his illness to Piyari at Patna, who hurriedly comes with her stepson to him and takes him to Patna. Srikanta spends some days there in the loving care of Piyari, and one day Srikanta takes leave of Piyari and goes to his native village. ;Part II In the second part, Srikanta's voyage to Rangoon (Burma) and his stay there have been narrated in details. Srikanta gets acquainted with many strange people on board the ship bound for Rangoon, among whom are Abhaya, a young married woman, and her male companion named Rohini. Abhaya was going to Rangoon to live with her husband, but she is treated very inhumanly by her beastly husband and is refused entry into his house. Abhaya and Rohini, who love each other, live together like husband and wife. Srikanta returns to his native village, but is taken ill there. Rajalakshmi comes to him and takes charge of his treatment and nursing. ;Part III Srikanta and Rajalakshmi come to a village in the district of Birbhum. There Rajalakshmi is always busy with her religious practices and discourses. Srikanta is left alone, the rift between them becomes wider. ;Part IV Srikanta thinks of going to Burma again, but by chance he meets his old friend Gahar in his village. Gahar takes him to a Vaishnava Ashram where he meets Kamallata who becomes very intimate with him. At the end, Kamallata leaves the Ashram bidding goodbye to Srikanta. Characters The principle characters of the novel are: * Srikanta — The protagonist * Indranath — Srikanta's adventurous friend * Annadadidi — an outcast woman and wife of a snake-charmer * Rajlakshmi (Pyari Baiji) — a dancer girl in love with Srikanta * Abhaya — A Rangoon-bound woman whose husband is an employee in Srikanta's office * Kamallata — a sprightly Vaishnavi * Gahar — Srikanta's Muslim friend who loves Kamallata * Ratan — witty and faithful servant of Rajlakshmi The book features a large number of female characters− most of them based on women Sarat Chandra had known personally. There is Annada Didi, brought up in a conservative middle-class family, who elopes with a snake charmer. Although her husband is a scoundrel, Annada remains loyal to him, for which she is idolized by the young Srikanta. This character is based on a Muslim woman who lived with her snake charmer husband in a village near Sarat's native village. As a child, Sarat would often visit her with his friend Indranath. Indranath is courageous and daredevil who always inspires Sarat. When Annada's husband died, this woman had sold her earrings to the local grocer with instruction that the money obtained be given to Sarat, and soon after that she had left her village permanently. Another character in the book is Abhaya, who begins a live in relationship with a man in defiance of the existing social norms, after being deserted by her husband. This character is based on a woman Sarat Chandra had known in Rangoon, who lived in a locality inhabited by mechanics and artisans. Her husband would periodically beat this woman, and yet out of a slavish chastity she would not leave him despite there being a man who loved her and who offered to rescue her from her plight. In the book, Sarat Chandra depicts women demanding rights for themselves in their own voice. The protagonist Srikanta has an argument with Abhaya about the propriety of what Abhaya has done; Srikanta argues from the orthodox and traditional point of view, but all his arguments are intelligently demolished by Abhaya. Reception Srikanta was translated into English by Sachchidananda Vatsyayan 'Agyeya' in 1944. It was translated into French by J G Delamain (1930), and into Italian by Ferdinando Belloni-Filippi (1925). In 2006, it was translated into Spanish by Gloria Khisha.

It is an operational component of the Carabineros de Chile. History The earliest recorded instance of a force of guards for the executive residence was during the government of Manuel Bulnes in 1851. The Carabineros became responsible for defense of La Moneda in 1932 and the guard contingent at the palace assumed its current name, the Palace Guard, in 1996. A cordon of the Palace Guard in summer white uniform in 2010 In addition to public duties, the Palace Guard also has practical security responsibilities for the defense of La Moneda. In 2016 Carabineros assigned to the Palace Guard physically detention a group of student protesters who stormed the courtyard of the palace before its gates could be sealed. During the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, a 300-man force of the then-named Presidential Guard, and other carabineros, fortified the perimeter of La Moneda against the Chilean Army. They remained at their posts until 9:00 a.m. the day of the putsch, withdrawing after being informed that Gen. César Mendoza had thrown his support to the newly-declared junta. Female carabineros joined the Palace Guard for the first time in December 2001. The Guard Group, since 2012, also has a full horse guards troop, carrying lances in state ceremonies. The Guard Group reports to the Directorate of Special Services and Border Security of the Carabineros, and a specialized company is assigned to secure the Palace of Cerro Castillo in Viña del Mar. Drill and ceremony A changing of the guard ceremony occurs every 48 hours at 10:00 a.m. During it, two Carabineros mounted units and the Central Band of the Carabineros escort the incoming guard detachment to La Moneda, and the outgoing detachment from it. The current drill for the changing of the guard was instituted in 1936. Both the old and new guard detachments have an infantry company and a cavalry platoon, with two buglers, while the old guard detachment has a drummer attached. Each Monday since its inception the Guard has provided two, ten-man squads, a drummer and a bugler to form a cordon of honor for the entrance of the President of Chile into La Moneda at the start of the work week. If the President is outside the capital, the drill is performed instead for the Vice President. The guard of honor platoon is made up of infantrymen from the Guard's infantry component.

Civic Center Plaza occupies two blocks bounded by McAllister, Larkin, Grove, and Carlton B. Goodlett (the section of Polk between City Hall and the plaza was renamed for Dr. Goodlett in 1999), divided into a north block and south block by the former alignment of Fulton Street. The block north of Fulton is built over a three-story parking garage (completed in 1960); the block south of Fulton lies over a former exhibition space, Brooks Hall (completed in 1958). Design Original design concept sketch from A.L. Warswick, c. 1912 According to the San Francisco Recreation & Parks Department, the size of Civic Center Plaza ranges from . Civic Center Plaza is approximately symmetrical from north to south (across an imaginary east-west line drawn along the former route of Fulton Street). Through the center of the plaza, two aisles of London plane trees flank an east-west pathway leading to City Hall, with formal plantings north and south of the tree aisle. The plaza was reconstructed starting in 1956 to build two underground structures: Brooks Hall and a parking garage. There are two play structures which opened in 1999 and were refurbished in 2017 on the east (Larkin) side of the plaza, one in the northeast corner, and one in the southeast corner. Brooks Hall Brooks Hall, an underground space connected to the basement level of Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, was the main exhibition space for the City of San Francisco from its completion in 1958 until 1981, when the first phase of Moscone Center was completed. Over the course of its history, several notable computer shows held their inaugural events at Brooks Hall, including the West Coast Computer Faire (1977) and Macworld (1985). It is currently used to store materials from the nearby Main Library and other historical artifacts, including the disassembled Exhibition Organ, a pipe organ which was donated to San Francisco for the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition. Parking garage A three-story parking garage was completed under the north block of the plaza in 1960. Access to the garage is provided by ramps on McAllister and Larkin. Overall dimensions of the parking garage are and the floor-to-ceiling clearance ranges from on the uppermost level to on the two lower levels. The structure rests on a concrete slab varying in thickness from thick. The parking structure was designed by Gould and Degenkolb. Playgrounds The playgrounds near Larkin were first installed in 1993 (north) and 1998 (south) as part of the remodeling of City Hall completed in 1999. They were shut down and renovated in 2017 at a cost of $10 million, funded by a grant from the Helen Diller Family Foundation (administered by The Trust for Public Land), and reopened in February 2018, when they were renamed the Helen Diller Civic Center Playgrounds. The remodeled Helen Diller Playgrounds were designed by Andrea Cochran Landscape Architecture and used concepts that drew inspiration from local weather phenomena, including Karl the fog. Artificial grass is installed to cut water use, and the playgrounds are under constant surveillance. History Civic Auditorium and San Francisco City Hall (under construction) in the background, circa 1916. After San Francisco was selected in 1911 to host the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition, numerous civic improvements were proposed, and a commission was set up to judge entries for a City Hall design competition. The jurors on the commission were John Galen Howard, Frederick W. Meyer, and John Reid, Jr. An early design by A. Lacy Warswick, a city architect, called for twin fountains along the north-south centerline of the plaza. Camp Agnos The plaza has had a history as a congregation spot for homeless people, driven in part by its proximity to the Tenderloin District. A tent city in Civic Center Plaza had existed for years prior to 1989. Art Agnos campaigned on a promise to treat the homeless more humanely and won the campaign for Mayor of San Francisco in 1987. After he assumed office, a large influx of homeless people started to move into Civic Center Plaza during the summer of 1989, prompting some to dub the new tent city Camp Agnos. The preceding mayor, Dianne Feinstein, had periodically ordered people to be removed from the plaza; in contrast, Agnos's campaign pledge exposed him to criticism after the homeless were described to be aggressively panhandling visitors. As a compromise, in July of that year, Agnos ordered police to remove tents and makeshift shelters but not the homeless residents. Following the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, some residents of San Francisco were forced to camp outdoors while buildings were inspected; more destitute citizens were forced out of their subsidized single room occupancy hotels and many made their way to Camp Agnos. Agnos again ordered encampments removed in July 1990, but refused to move the homeless people to another site until two permanent shelters could be built, which opened later that year. The long delay in opening shelters and the mayor's seeming acceptance of Camp Agnos contributed to Agnos's defeat in the re- election campaign of 1991. City Hall gilding A similar view from 2014 shows modern high-rises overlooking the Civic Auditorium and Civic Center Plaza. Civic Center Plaza was dedicated as the Joseph L. Alioto Performing Arts Piazza to honor former mayor Joseph Alioto on October 28, 1998. A spokesperson for Mayor Willie Brown stated \\"It will be an area where people can sing opera, recite poetry, do all the things Mayor Alioto was so enamored of\\". Alioto had died earlier in 1998. As part of the initiative started by Mayor Brown to remodel City Hall, a refurbished Civic Center Plaza was unveiled in January 1999, including two new playgrounds; police patrols were deployed under a new policy to roust the homeless, who generally moved two blocks east to UN Plaza. Public concerts were scheduled as part of the effort to change the unsavory reputation of Civic Center Plaza. At the time, it was announced that plans for a permanent remodeling of the plaza were being prepared. Redesign In 2018, city officials started accepting proposals to redesign the plaza.

It is located east of City Hall and is connected to it by the Fulton Mall and Civic Center Plaza. Public transit access is provided by the BART and Muni Metro stops at the Civic Center/UN Plaza station, which has a station entrance within the plaza itself. UN Plaza was designed by a joint venture of firms led by the noted architects Lawrence Halprin, John Carl Warnecke, and Mario Ciampi; Halprin designed the large sunken fountain. The plaza was dedicated in 1975 to commemorate the formation of the United Nations and the signing of the Charter of the United Nations on 26 June 1945. Since its dedication, the plaza was refurbished in 1995 and 2005, and in Spring 2018, three redesign proposals were proposed for public review. Location and history 1916 map of Civic Center. Fulton Street extends east (towards the bottom of this map) from San Francisco City Hall and Civic Center Plaza, between the main library building and planned opera house. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed the old City Hall, the city rebuilt it and other administrative buildings as Civic Center; the key access route to the new Civic Center from Market was along the east–west Fulton Street, which lay parallel to and between McAllister and Grove. East of Van Ness, the rebuilt City Hall (1915) and Civic Center Plaza (1911) take up two city blocks each between McAllister and Grove, so the two-block eastern portion of Fulton began at the intersection with Larkin and terminated at Market. Currently, the western half of Fulton (from Larkin to Hyde) is known as Fulton Mall; the eastern half (Hyde to Market) is UN Plaza. UN Plaza also includes a north–south segment built on the former alignment of Leavenworth, which continues north of McAllister. The Leavenworth and Fulton alignments of UN Plaza meet at a right angle; the United Nations Plaza Fountain and entrance to the transit station are where the two alignments meet. Concept development An east–west pedestrian mall featuring \\"great bands of trees, a grass mall and paved areas accented by lights and banks of flags [to] expand and extend this central park area [Civic Center Plaza] from the City Hall down Fulton Street to Market\\" was first proposed as part of the 1958 Civic Center Development Plan. At the time, a new long-distance subway system was being studied with an alignment along Market Street, which would eventually become the Market Street Subway serving both BART and Muni Metro. In the following 1962 report What to do About Market Street, landscape architect Lawrence Halprin described his initial vision for the proposed pedestrian mall: \\"... when the Hyde–Larkin block [of Fulton] is reconstructed (as proposed in [the 1958 Civic Center Development Plan]), views into the Civic Center should be created. Thus our Civic Center, one of the most beautiful in America, could give tremendous support to Market Street.\\" The proposed pedestrian mall was included in the September 1963 Downtown San Francisco plan prepared by Mario Ciampi for the Department of City Planning. Independently, in 1965, the first concepts for the Civic Center Station Plaza were sketched out in the Market Street Design Report written by Ciampi and John Carl Warnecke. The concepts for a plaza at Seventh, either straddling Market or south of Market, would serve the future underground transit station and connect to both Fulton Mall (to the west) and the Greyhound bus terminal (to the south). Warnecke and Ciampi updated the concepts for the new plaza in the 1967 Market Street Design Plan, which called for \\"a major civic sculpture\\" to dominate \\"the central space and [create] the focus for the activities of the Plaza\\". The commission for that major civic sculpture was realized as a fountain, designed by Halprin and completed in 1975. The architecture firm headed by Halprin joined those led by Ciampi and Warnecke in 1968 to form the Market Street Joint Venture Architects, which were responsible for the overarching Market Street Redevelopment Plan. UN Plaza was designed as part of the Market Street/Civic Center Station portion of that plan. The same architectural joint venture was also responsible for the design of the other two large plazas completed earlier along Market: Hallidie Plaza (1973) next to the station and Embarcadero Plaza (1972) at the eastern end of Market near the Ferry Building. The Market Street Redevelopment Plan was implemented throughout the 1970s, and was substantially complete by 1979, when Joshua Friedwald documented the results for Halprin & Associates. Construction Granite latitude and longitude inlays at UN Plaza (2013) In the original design, UN Plaza features included of brick paving, laid in a herringbone pattern, and of grass lawn. The paving in the southwest part of UN Plaza, near the border with Market Street, is interrupted by a cross formed by granite blocks inlaid with brass which indicate the coordinates of San Francisco used to measure distances to other cities. It is the site of the original City Hall. The pedestrian promenade along the Fulton alignment was lit with 16 light standards and featured 24 wood slat benches along the outer edges along with 192 London plane and black poplar trees. As mentioned above, the focal point was intended to be a large fountain executed in granite slabwork. The design of UN Plaza is credited to the landscape architecture firm of Halprin & Associates, with Don Carter as principal-in-charge, and Angela Danadjieva (who later served as lead designer for Freeway Park in Seattle) as the landscape architect. Several commercial buildings were demolished to make way for the new plaza; only the Orpheum Theater (1925), 1 United Nations Plaza (1932), and the Federal Building (1936) were retained. United Nations Plaza was constructed from January to June 1975, following the reconstruction of Market Street after the cut-and-cover excavation for the Market Street Subway. It was dedicated in 1975 to commemorate the formation of the United Nations and the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations on 26 June 1945. Mayor Joseph Alioto dedicated the first tree on the plaza—to honor the late UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld—on June 26, 1975. RefurbishmentAnniversaries of the United Nations= The plaza's obelisk in 2014 In 1995, for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, a \\"Walk of Great Ideas\\", funded with private donations, was added to the plaza at a cost of . The Walk consisted of eight white granite paving stones inlaid with the preamble to the UN Charter in brass, matching the style of the coordinates cross in the southwest part of the plaza. Additional updates in 1995 included inscribing a list of UN member nations on the light standards, adding the UN emblem to the center of the plaza, engraving the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on an existing tall black granite obelisk, and updating the lighting fixtures. The original luminaires were semi-translucent and square, matching the shape of the columns; the updated fixtures (which remain today) are frosted glass globes. A new round of refurbishment started in March 2005, at a cost of , for the 60th anniversary of the UN. Planned improvements included a new stone monument to commemorate UN World Environment Day 2005, hanging the flags of all 191 member nations, and the inscription of new member nation names on the light standards. In addition, the city began to increase the number of events booked for the plaza to encourage \\"a healthy, vibrant environment that anybody can enjoy.\\" =Civic Center Public Realm Plan= In 2017, the CMG Landscape Architecture firm was hired by the city planning department to redesign UN Plaza along with the adjoining Civic Center Plaza and Fulton Mall. The design goals of the subsequent Civic Center Public Realm Plan were to retain the scale but encourage pedestrian traffic. CMG unveiled three proposals in Spring 2018: # Civic Sanctuary, a design \\"that celebrates History\\" by evoking the Beaux-Arts spirit of the original plan. # Culture Connector, billed as \\"a vision for an inclusive commons that prioritizes Ecology, Wellness, and Variety\\" which includes additional trees to shade a promenade between Market Street and City Hall. # Public Platform, \\"centered on Performance\\" by creating flexible plazas for temporary activities. Current uses and events Heart-of-the-City farmer's market, view east along Fulton/UN Plaza towards Market (2016) Rebecca Solnit, a staff writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, called UN Plaza \\"the spiritual and geographical heart of a considerable territory\\" because it was \\"a place where you know where you stand in the world, in the most practical and metaphysical senses\\" in 2004. Solnit called it a place that \\"just seems to encourage marching and gathering and walking\\", a public space that encouraged citizen participation with an active farmer's market and numerous protests near government offices. Since 1981, the Heart-of-the-City Farmers Market has been held at UN Plaza on Wednesdays and Sundays, which alleviates the food desert that otherwise would exist in Civic Center and the South of Market neighborhoods. rainbow flag above UN Plaza for the 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade The homeless in San Francisco have long occupied the site, dating back to before the construction of UN Plaza. In 2001, as an attempt to combat homelessness, the city removed the plaza's benches overnight. An annual memorial, the Interfaith Homeless Persons Memorial, is held near the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, at UN Plaza to remember the homeless who have died that year. The San Francisco Police Department periodically increase patrols and enforcement in the area, and in 2018 parked a mobile command unit at UN Plaza in response to \\"a number of public complaints about a lot of the behaviors, the drug users, the drug dealers\\" according to SFPD Chief Bill Scott. UN Plaza was designed as a pivot point for parades along Market to continue along Fulton Mall to City Hall. Gay Freedom Day Parades in 1977 (drawing 200,000) and 1978 (350,000) were established along that route and were the largest annual parades in San Francisco, which contributed to the city's reputation as a center for LGBTQ activism and culture. From 1985 to 1995, UN Plaza was the site of the AIDS/ARC (or ARC/AIDS) Vigil, the first civil disobedience protest against the AIDS epidemic; on October 27, 1985, two HIV-positive men, Steve Russell and Frank Bert, chained themselves to the doors of 50 UN Plaza, the regional office for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, to protest the government's inaction on AIDS. The round-the-clock vigil was supported by a camp of volunteers staying in UN Plaza and continued to be held there over the next ten years, until a winter storm destroyed the encampment in December 1995. Fountain The fountain in 2011 The fountain in UN Plaza was designed by Lawrence Halprin in collaboration with Ernest Born and completed in 1975. The granite slabs are intended to symbolize the continents of Earth, and the lowest central block symbolizes a mythical lost continent. The original design called for water to flood and drain from the basin on a two-minute cycle to simulate the ocean's tides. Aerial jets make the fountain's location visible from the street, and also alert spectators to the start of a new flood/drain cycle. Computer- controlled features were intended to detect wind and attenuate pump output accordingly, to avoid splashing passers-by. The fountain never worked as designed and was fenced off as early as 1978. Built at a cost of , the fountain is largely sunken in the surrounding brick plaza, its basin being wide; and it contains 673 granite blocks over a total length of . Several blocks are inscribed; one carries a quotation from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. According to Halprin, the fountain was meant to be \\"a place to walk to, sit down, do theater in\\"; and Halprin \\"claimed to be the first designer to create a space that could actually be used by people.\\" During the design, Halprin applied a concept he dubbed \\"motation\\", meaning how an observer's perception of the environment changes depending on their speed and motion. Shutoff and proposed removal In 1994, the fountain at UN Plaza was proposed to be removed, as it had attracted a significant homeless population, was the site of bird droppings, public bathing, and public urination, and was called \\"out of scale\\", an assertion that was rejected by Halprin, the original designer. Because the fountain is registered with the city as part of its civic art collection, removing the fountain would require extensive reviews and public hearings. An assessment completed in 1995 concluded the fountain was not operating as designed, as only a single pump was still working to supply the jets, and the filtration was completely defunct. In March 2003, the city fenced off the fountain and temporarily shut off its water to alleviate the daily burden of cleaning used needles and human feces from it. That same month, a working group commissioned by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors published a report recommending the fountain be removed. Ultimately, the Board of Supervisors rejected the 2003 proposal to remove the fountain. The renewed calls to remove the fountain were based on many of the same reasons as those from ten years prior; an article in The New York Times published in 2004 called the plaza \\"a public toilet, shower, washing machine, brothel, garbage can and drug market all in one\\". Bollards and chains were added around the fountain during the 2005 renovation to prohibit public entry into the fountain; they have since been removed. A metal fence was erected to block off the fountain again in 2018 and replaced with a white plastic fence by April 2019; that was replaced with a high plywood fence in August in preparation for a project to convert part of the fountain's sump into a storage tank for treated non-potable water that will be used to wash streets in Civic Center and the Tenderloin. A branch of the subterranean Hayes Creek had been discovered to run underneath UN Plaza during the construction of the fountain's sump; seepage had been pumped for use in street-cleaning trucks, but that source was abandoned in the 1980s. Three proposals were advanced in 2018 to redesign the entire Civic Center area, including UN Plaza; of those three, only Civic Sanctuary calls for the restoration of the fountain at UN Plaza. Public Platform would install a new \\"iconic, interactive fountain\\" near the present site. Culture Connector would remove the water features altogether and convert the fountain into a bouldering playground. This prompted Linda Day to publish a blog with the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) to protest its potential destruction. In general, the public did not support retaining the fountain; in 2011, a reader survey of Curbed SF found the United Nations Plaza Fountain was one of the least favorite public art pieces in San Francisco. In February 2019, an updated preliminary concept largely drawn from Public Platform called for a conversion of the fountain into an \\"interactive fountain and garden\\" by partially filling it and adding plantings. A follow-up blog posted by the ASLA welcomed the retention of the fountain and the painstaking public outreach process, but expressed skepticism about when (or if) the plan would be implemented. Critical evaluation When the fountain was unveiled, Allan Temko, the architecture critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, declared it to be \\"pretentious schmaltz\\" that \\"rarely work[s] and merely toss[es] around empty muscatel bottles.\\" At the fountain's 1975 dedication, Andrew Young, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, called it \\"a tribute to the U.N.'s goals of seeking peaceful resolutions to international rivalries\\". In a 2007 retrospective, current Chronicle architecture critic John King said the \\"mannered drama of [Halprin's] plazas along Market Street\\" collectively \\"haven't aged well\\". Landmark status When Civic Center was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), UN Plaza was noted for providing \\"a pedestrian approach to the Civic Center and a clear view from Market Street to City Hall.\\" UN Plaza is eligible on its own design merits for inclusion on the NRHP, and San Francisco also considers it eligible for inclusion on the California Register of Historic Resources for its original design merits, in addition to its historic role in the LGBTQ movement as the site of parades and protests.

Breeding began in 1997 at the Washington State University (WSU) Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center in Wenatchee, Washington, initially overseen by Bruce Barritt and now by Kate Evans. Characteristics Cosmic Crisp combines the features of the existing Honeycrisp and Enterprise apples, namely, it is intended to have the texture and juiciness of the Honeycrisp, and the late-ripening behavior and long storage of the Enterprise. In breeding the variety, the focus was not on the appearance, but on durability and shelf life. Cosmic Crisp is characterized mainly by uniformly colored dark red skin, dense firm flesh, and an improved shelf life. The look of the apple's light lenticels against its wine-red skin reminded focus groups of a galaxy against a night sky, which led to it being named the Cosmic Crisp. It is the first widely- grown apple variety developed in Washington. The apple ripens at the same time as Red Delicious and is expected by the producers of it to replace a large part of the Red Delicious stocks. Cosmic Crisp was made available to consumers in 2019, after 20 years of development. Industry watchers expect Cosmic Crisp production to outpace Pink Lady and Honeycrisp apples in five years. The New York Times described the apple as \\"dramatically dark, richly flavored and explosively crisp and juicy\\", making it \\"the most promising and important apple of the future\\". FoodRepublic.com called it \\"firmer than the Honeycrisp, but not too firm. And it is high in both sugar and acidity, making it far superior to the Red Delicious, Gala and Fuji varieties as well.\\" Northwest Public Radio notes that Washington, which produces 70% of U.S. apples, is betting that the apple will \\"conquer\\" the market. First plantings The variety was first planted for commercial use in spring 2017, with 12 million trees pre-ordered by Washington state orchards. The variety is initially only available to Washington-based growers, and will remain limited to them for at least ten years. Growers pay a royalty for each tree purchased and for each box of apples sold. Interest was so high the trees initially had to be distributed to apple farmers in a lottery held in 2014—WSU had planned to provide 300,000 saplings but were met with requests for 4 million. Within three years, over 13 million Cosmic Crisp trees had been planted. Lawsuits emerged between WSU and a Seattle spinoff that the university claimed distributed over 100,000 trees improperly.'Cosmic Crisp' conflict: Washington State University sues its own spinoff in dispute over 'apple of the future', Taylor Soper, Geekwire, March 2018 WSU owns the Cosmic Crisp patent.

The complex includes the 1921 Dearborn City Hall (originally the Springwells Municipal Building), the 1929 Police and Municipal Courts Building, and an office/auditorium concourse addition constructed in 1981. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History The settlement of Springwells, located around what is now the Dearborn City Hall, was first established along the Michigan Central Railroad line in 1837. Although Springwells was assigned a post office, it was not incorporated as a separate political jurisdiction until 1921, when the Village of Springwells was incorporated. That year the village commissioned architect Marcus Burrowes to construct the Springwells Municipal Building, Construction cost just over $200,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Burrowes envisioned the Municipal Building as the first of a complex of connected structures. Although his plan was never completely realized, additional structures were built in the 1920s to make a municipal complex. With the tax base from the Ford River Rouge Complex and associated workers, Springwells rapidly grew into one of Detroit's largest and most prosperous suburbs, and the government complex grew along with it. A few years later the village was incorporated as a city, and in 1925 Springwells changed its name to Fordson. Also in 1925, the Fire Hall and Garage was constructed adjacent to the Municipal Building; the Fire Alarm Building was also constructed around the same time. In 1929, the City of Fordson consolidated with the nearby Village of Dearborn and Dearborn Township to form the City of Dearborn. In the same year, a Signal Bureau Building was added, along with the Police and Municipal Courts Building. The Dearborn City Hall was the seat of power in Dearborn. The first mayor of the consolidated Dearborn was Henry Ford's cousin Clyde M. Ford, who served from 1929 to 1935. Orville L. Hubbard was mayor from 1942 to 1978. In 1979, three of the smaller buildings in the complex—the Fire Hall and Garage, the Fire Alarm Building, and the Signal Bureau Building—were demolished make room for the 1981 concourse addition. Description The Dearborn City Hall Complex occupies a nearly an entire block along Michigan Avenue near downtown Dearborn. The complex consists of three buildings: the 1921 Dearborn City Hall which faces north on Michigan Avenue, the 1929 Police and Municipal Courts Building which faces west on Maple Street, and the 1981 office, auditorium, and parking structure addition to the southeast, which connects the two other buildings. The site also includes a landscaped public park, a small paved war memorial plaza, and a small surface parking lot. Dearborn City Hall The Dearborn City Hall is a -story symmetric red brick Georgian Revival structure with a limestone base and hipped roof, designed in 1921 by Marcus Burrowes. It is approximately long and deep, with the main entrance located in the center of the main facade. The main elevation is five bays wide, with projecting three- bay wide wings at each end of the building. The windows are irregularly spaced, with double-hung, four-over-four units installed in the basement, divided light units with square heads on the first floor, and round arch divided light units on the second-floor. The roof is covered with clay tile, and a dominant Colonial cupola is located in the center of the building. The interior of the building has a central corridor with terrazzo and marble floors on all four levels. The corridors have a marble wainscot, and each floor is connected with a grand curving marble staircase. Most of the interior space consists of offices and storage rooms, with plastered walls and ceilings. Most of these spaces were remodeled in 1981. Police and Municipal Courts Building The Police and Municipal Courts Building is a symmetrical U-shaped red brick -story Colonial Revival structure, designed in 1929 by architect John Kasurin of the firm Fry and Kasurin. The building measures approximately long by deep. The main facade has a central projecting three-bay limestone entrance section clad in limestone, flanked by five-bay wide portions at each end of the building. The center entrance contains a tall double-door entryway with a large glass light and limestone pediment lintel, with a pair of double-hung windows flanking the entry doors. Four Tuscan limestone pilasters support a projecting limestone entablature above the entry. The windows in the structure are irregularly spaced, and include double-hung three-over-three units in the basement, and square head double- hung eight-over-eight units on the first and second floors. The interior of the building is similar to that of the City Hall, containing a central corridor with terrazzo and marble floors on all levels, with a marble wainscot on the upper floors. A grand curving marble staircase connects the floors in the central lobby. Most of the interior space consists of offices and storage rooms, with plastered walls and ceilings. Most of these spaces were remodeled in 1981. Concourse Addition The Concourse Addition does not contribute to the historic district. The addition is a partially underground cast-in- place concrete structure designed by Rosetti Associates in 1981 to provide a basement-level connection between the other two buildings.

Pahl is notable as the photographer who published the first photographs of Adolf Hitler.  Career  From 1923, Georg Pahl studied under with Heinrich Sanden I (born in 1877), a professional photographer who had founded the company Atlantic Photo in Berlin in 1919 (the company would change its name to Atlantic Photo-Gesellschaft mbH in 1930). On 4 March 1923, Pahl founded his own agency, A-B-C-Aktuelle-Bilder-Centrale, in Berlin-Steglitz. His venture specialised on important political events, public events and daily life in the Weimar Republic and the period of National socialism from 1923 to 1936. From 1919 to 1923, Hitler went essentially unphotographed, as to prevent the police from obtaining images that would help in his identification.Hitler's party, the NSDAP, had been banned in Prussia on 15 November 1922 and as chairman and an Austrian citizen, he faced arrest. Georg Pahl obtained the first images from these early years of the Party, when he recognised and photographed Hitler as he visited the Luna Park in Berlin. Pahl reported that Hitler tried to jump him and seize the camera, but failed, and eventually convinced Pahl to destroy the negative. On 2 September 1923, Pahl managed to photograph Hitler again during the Deutscher Tag parade at Nuremberg, before fleeing before SA stormtroopers; these images were the first published photographs of Hitler. As a consequence to these events, Hitler established ties with Heinrich Hoffmann to control his imagery, and from 1934 Georg Pahl was officially banned from attending events of the NSDAP. In 1944, Pahl was one of the cameramen of Panorama-Farbmonatsschau, a monthly show of colour news. Pahl's works feature prominently in the German Federal Archives.

Ochando was an illustrious and decorated general with a prolific career in politics. As a deputy and a senator, infrastructure projects and improvement of the Spanish military were among his key programs. Early life and career Federico Ochando was born of Andres Maria Sanchez Ochando and Ana Catalina Chumillas on 14 March 1848 in Fuentealbilla, Albacete, Spain. His brother, Andres Ochando y Chumillas, was a lawyer and would serve as Deputy of Casas-Ibáñez from 1893 to 1896. He married Maria Matilda Valera y Canada and they had a son, Roman Angel Emeterio Sanchez Ochando y Chumillas, who was born in 1867. His son would also serve as Deputy of Casas-Ibáñez from 1919 to 1920. In 1864, Ochando entered the Academia de Estado Mayor and was promoted as alférez in 1867. Two years later, he had the rank of staff lieutenant. He first saw action during the Third Carlist War, when he participated in military campaigns against Carlists in Barcelona, Sant Celoni, and Valencia. He then fought opponents of the Spanish Restoration, which placed Alfonso XII of Spain as king. His participation in the March to Cuba during the Ten Years' War earned him the rank of brigadier general in 1878. Deputy and Governor In 1879, he was elected as Deputy of Casas- Ibáñez with 66% of the vote. In 1881, he was elected as deputy in the same district with 69% of the vote, performing better than his first election. Ochando would be one of the most notable personalities from the town of Casas- Ibáñez, who was also a leader of the Liberal Party during his political career. In 1886, he would serve as Deputy of Alcaraz, a town in the same province as Casas-Ibáñez. He was elected in the district with 100% of the vote. He was elected for the third time as Deputy of Casas-Ibáñez in 1891, but there was no record for his vote percentage. In 1893, he was elected for the second time as Deputy of Alcaraz, again with 100% of the vote. However, prior to taking his seat as deputy, he was appointed as the 110th Governor-General of the Philippines, replacing Eulogio Despujol y Dusay on 1 March 1893. The dismissal of Despujol was attributed to the new liberal government, with Práxedes Mateo Sagasta as Prime Minister of Spain. One of the notable acts of Ochando was the change of José Rizal's guard. On 16 May 1893, Ricardo Carnicero was replaced by Juan Sitges as district governor. There were rumors that Ochando gave orders to Sitges for tightening Rizal's security and to shoot the prisoner if he escaped. Soon enough, Ramón Blanco, 1st Marquis of Peña Plata assumed office as the new Governor-General of the Philippines in the same year. Senator Ochando as senator in 1896. After his return to Spain due to illness, he was appointed military governor of Madrid in 1894 and promoted to the rank of lieutenant general in 1895. The following year, he arrived in Cuba as Valeriano Weyler's chief of staff and participated in the Spanish campaign during the Cuban War of Independence. In the same year, he was elected Senator of La Habana. In 1897, he returned to Spain and was appointed Captain General of Aragon. In 1898, he was appointed Captain General of Andalusia. In the same year, he was elected as Senator of Albacete, a position he would serve in until 1902. While serving as senator, he was appointed as Inspector General of the Guardia Civil in 1901. In 1903, he was elected for the fourth time as Deputy of Casas-Ibáñez with 85% of the vote. In the same year, he was appointed Inspector General of the Carabineros. The following year, he was appointed Captain General of Old Castile. In 1905, he was back in the Senate. However, he was not only Senator of Albacete, he was made senator for life (senador vitalicio) by royal decree in 1906. Among his activities as senator include requesting ratings for Ministers of the Crown, and propose increasing the benefits for members of the armed forces. He requested the Spanish Council of State to report on the conflict between the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of War concerning the salary of a regional officer. He proposed to provide a pension for General Diego Ollero y Carmona's widow, Teresa Morales Guerrero Estrella, and General Francisco Rizzo y Ramirez's widow, Dolores Goñi y Zangroniz. He proposed the inclusion of the Bonete Road expansion in the general road plan of Spain. The Bonete Road runs from Albacete to Ayora. Ochando was known for his various infrastructure projects in his district during his service as deputy and senator. Another major project undertaken upon Ochando's initiative was the Baeza-Utiel Line, also known as the Baeza-Albacete Line. Planning for the 366-kilometer long railway connecting Baeza and Utiel began in 1926. He requested the enforcement of the law concerning civilian destination of licensed members of the armed forces. Lastly, he requested financial assistance for the youth to enter military academies. During his entire career in the Senate, he served thrice as Vice President of the Senate of Spain (1901–1902, 1905–1907, 1910–1911). Meanwhile, from 1907 to 1910, he served as Director-general of the Carabineros, as well as Sub-minister (Undersecretary) of War. Death He died on 2 February 1929 in Madrid, Spain. Two days later, the President of the Spanish Senate (Álvaro de Figueroa y Torres) gave a memorial to the late senator. A road, Calle Federico Ochando, was named after him.

It acts as an antagonist at ligand-gated chloride channels, in particular those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA-receptors). Isoxazolines, among the chloride channel modulators, bind to a distinct and unique target site within the insect GABA- gated chloride channels, thereby blocking pre-and post-synaptic transfer of chloride ions across cell membranes. Prolonged afoxolaner-induced hyperexcitation results in uncontrolled activity of the central nervous system and death of insects and acarines.  Marketing  Afoxolaner is the active principle of the veterinary medicinal products NexGard (alone) and Nexgard Spectra (in combination with milbemycin oxime). They are indicated for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations, and the treatment and control of tick infestations in dogs and puppies (8 weeks of age and older, weighing 4 pounds (~1.8 kilograms) of body weight or greater) for one month. These products are administered orally and poisons fleas once they start feeding. The marketing authorization was granted by the European Medicines Agency in February 2014 for NexGard and January 2015 for Nexgard Spectra, after only 14 and 12 months of quality, safety and efficacy assessment performed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP). Therefore, long- term effects are not known.  List of excipients In NexGard and NexGard Spectra: * Maize starch * Soy protein fines * Beef braised flavouring * Povidone (E1201) * Macrogol 400 (reputed laxatives) * Macrogol 4000 (reputed laxatives) * Macrogol 15 hydroxystearate (reputed laxatives) * Glycerol (E422) * Triglycerides, medium-chain Additionally in NexGard Spectra: * Citric acid monohydrate (E330) * Butylated hydroxytoluene (E321)  Safety = Dosage  Afoxolaner is recommended to be administered at a dose of 2.7-7 mg/kg dog's bodyweight.  Toxicity for mammals  According to clinical studies performed prior marketing: * The oral toxicity profile of afoxolaner consists of a diuretic effect (rats only), effects secondary to a reduction in food consumption (rats and rabbits only) and occasional vomiting and/or diarrhoea (dogs, 120 and 200 mg/kg bodyweight (bw)) following high oral doses. No treatment-related effects on vomiting or diarrhoea were noted following oral doses of up to 31.5 mg/kg bw in the pivotal target animal safety study, nor in the EU field trial. * mild gastrointestinal effects (vomiting, diarrhoea), pruritus, lethargy, anorexia, and neurological signs (convulsions, ataxia and muscle tremors) have been reported in less than 0.1% of 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports, most reported adverse reactions being self-limiting and of short duration, * (in combination with milbemycin oxime): vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, anorexia, and pruritus were observed in 0.2 to 1% of 10,000 animals treated and were generally self-limiting and of short duration, * In vitro studies reported that afoxolaner can bind to dopamine and norepinephrine cellular transport receptor systems and the CB1 receptor; inhibition of these catecholaminergic systems and certain types of competitive binding at CB1 receptors may mediate pharmacodynamic effects of diuresis, decreased food consumption, and decreased body weight in animals. According to post-marketing safety experience: * (in combination with milbemycin oxime): erythema and neurological signs (convulsions, ataxia and muscle tremors) have been reported in less than 0.1% of 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports, * The US FDA reports that some drugs in this class (isoxazolines), including afoxalaner, can have adverse neurologic effects on some dogs, such as muscle tremors, ataxia, and seizures. *Extralabel use of afoxolaner in a pet pig has been described without any adverse effects.https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00473/abstract Experimental use in commercial pigs also did not result in any adverse effects.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29914951/  Selectivity insects over mammalians  In vivo studies (repeat-dose toxicology in laboratory animals, target animal safety, field studies) provided by MERIAL, the company that produces afoxolaner-derivative medicines, did not show evidence of neurological or behavioural effects suggestive of GABA-mediated perturbations in mammals. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) therefore concluded that binding to dog, rat or human GABA receptors is expected to be low for afoxolaner. Selectivity for insect over mammalian GABA- receptors has been demonstrated for other isoxazolines. The selectivity might be explained by the number of pharmacological differences that exist between GABA-gated chloride channels of insects and vertebrates.

He was a top level military commander in the Republic of China before his defection to Communist China in 1949. Chen was awarded with the rank of General in 1955. Biography=Early Years Chen as a Republic of China military officer in the 1920s Chen was born into family of farmers in Hunan on 7 April 1903. He went through his education in private institutions and underwent military training in 1924. On 19 November 1924, he was transferred to the Whampoa Military Academy. Upon his graduation and stellar military performance during the Northern Expedition, he rose through the ranks quickly. By 1928, he was a colonel in the National Revolutionary Army. He was the general of the 24th Revolutionary Army (ROC) during the Central Plains War whom led a Pyrrhic victory against Shi Yousan. He was appointed as the 88th Division commander in 1932 and led the Republican Armies against the Communist Party of China's Chinese Red Army in Jiangxi and Fujian during the Encirclement Campaigns. Following his defeat to the Communists in 1934 at Shaxian County, Chen was transferred to the Lushan Military Academy. Upon his graduation and the trust he had over Chiang Kai-shek, he was appointed into the Republican Senate for military affairs and became the Director of the Guomindang Military Department. Sino-Japanese and Chinese Civil War After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Chen was appointed as a Lieutenant-General in the 2nd Army Division (reserve division). Between 1937-1939, he held key positions such as being the commander of the Changsha, Hengyang, Hengyang, Leiyang garrisons. In the winter of 1941, he was appointed as the deputy commander of the 71st ROC Army. In 1946, the 71st Army was transported by US warships to the Northeast in preparation for the anticipated Chinese Civil War. With the start of the Summer Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China by Communist general Lin Biao, Chen's 71st Army was forced to retreat to and rendezvous at Siping, Jilin. Mustering local forces and his own army, he had around 30 thousand man waiting from reinforcements. Between 22 May to 30 June 1947, Chen was able to repel the Chinese Red Army in Northeast China that was led by Li Tianyou. In June, he was able to resist the overwhelming forces under the command of Lin Biao at Siping Street for more than 40 days. For his gallant efforts, he was awarded with the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun and was promoted to the 7th Corps Commander. Although successful in the initial stages of the Siping Campaign, the Communist forces whom surrounded the stronghold managed to break the Nationalist defenses following a 9-month long assault. At the eve of the Huaihai Campaign, Bai Chongxi recommended Chen Mingren to Chiang Kai-shek as the garrison commander of Wuhan. Chen transferred to his Wuhuan office in October 1948 was concurrently the commander of the 29th Nationalist Army. He became the First Corps Commander and the provincial chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China On 4 August 1949, Chen and Cheng Qian defected to the Communists at Changsha. After being encouraged by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to continue his military service, he joined the People's Liberation Army.

From the Museo del Objeto del Objeto collection. The term cosmetic packaging is used for cosmetic containers (primary packaging) and secondary packaging of fragrances and cosmetic products. Cosmetic products are substances intended for human cleansing, beautifying and promoting an enhanced appearance without altering the body's structure or functions. Cosmetic packaging is standardized by an international norm set by the International Organization for Standardization and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the EU or the FDA. Marketers and manufacturers of cosmetic products must be compliant to these regulations to be able to market their cosmetic products in the corresponding areas of jurisdiction. History A cosmetic container, cosmetic box, or cosmetic vessel is found in the historical records, both as an artifact, as relief items in some cultures, and are sometimes referenced in historical or archaeological literature. They are sometimes created in specific styles, shapes, or motifs. The named 'cosmetic vessel' in Ancient Greece is the pyxis. In Ancient Egypt artifacts of hieroglyphically inscribed kohl tubes are found; also kohl vessels, and kohl spoons, which were formed in stylized shapes relevant to Egyptian ideology, including specific hieroglyphs. The use of the cosmetic vessel may extend to trinket items, car-keys, toiletry accessories, for example a nail clipper; as a non-toiletry storage container, it becomes an 'all-purpose' decorated, special-use vessel. Containers are known from many societies, ancient and modern. The Native Americans of the Americas made small containers woven from basketry materials, including pine needles. Ancient Egypt In Ancient Egypt toiletry items began in the Predynastic Period with ivory cosmetic articles; also bone, stone, or pottery. Ivory combs, and kohl spoons were among the first, with many shapes; common themes for shapes became the ankh symbol, ducks, lotus flowers, etc. In the time of the Predynastic and Old Kingdom, bowls were also mechanically drilled, including miniature sizes, and were used in life and also included as grave goods. The bowls were either a type of unguent jar, or a toiletry \\"kohl cosmetic vessel\\". The desert sun or Nile floodwaters during inundation produced a need for facial-eye protection, using 'eyepaint' or eyeliner, when working in the flooded lands; theoretically it was also used by males. The creation of predynastic cosmetic palettes with their eyepaint 'mixing circle', may have been the start of the lineage of the kohl cosmetic artifacts. The famed Narmer Palette, which scholars believe to commemorate the unification of upper and lower Egypt, is believed to be such a cosmetic article, perhaps even for the cosmetics of the king. Description The term cosmetic packaging includes primary and secondary packaging. Primary packaging, also called cosmetic containers, is housing the cosmetic product. It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic containers. An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging. The cosmetic container shall carry the name of the distributor, the ingredients, define storage, nominal content, product identification (e.g., batch number), warning notices, and directions for use. The secondary packaging shall, in addition, carry the address of the distributor and information on the cosmetic's mode of action. The secondary packaging does not need to carry any product identification notice. In cases where the cosmetic product is only wrapped by one single container, this container needs to carry all the information. Purpose of cosmetic packaging There are multiple reasons why care must be put into cosmetic containers. Not only must they protect the product, they need to provide conveniences for vendors and ultimately consumers. The main purpose of a cosmetic container is to protect the product while it is in storage or being transported. The container must be a well thought out solution that protects the product from deterioration and helps preserve its quality. It must be an attractive looking container as part of the marketing of a beauty product. The container must also contain labels that legibly display basic information about the product and the manufacturer. These labels include contact information, ingredients, expiration dates, warnings and instructions. Labels not only identify products and their origins, they help provide consumers with the facts that cannot be confusing or misleading. Ideally, the container is made of durable material to give the product a long shelf life. It must last even longer through consumer use. The frequent opening and closing of the container can take a toll on its condition over time. Ultimately, the container must protect the product to the degree that it remains a safe product for human consumption. In other words, the container must shield the product from dirt, dust and germs. The aesthetics of the container are considered extremely important since cosmetic products are mainly sold on brand image. Since cosmetic products are not considered medicine or survival products, the marketing of cosmetics depends heavily on associating brand awareness with emotion. The container must convey emotions about how the product will improve one's appearance and attitude. Many times cosmetics are repackaged and rebranded to help give them more market visibility. Protection The main purpose of a container is to store the product so that it is not degraded through storage, shipping and handling. Degradation and damage can be caused by various causes. These causes can be categorized into biological, chemical, thermal causes, damage caused by radiation and damage caused by human interaction, by electric sources or by pressure. In addition to protecting the product, packaging also plays a big role marketing cosmetic products. While product quality is a major factor in the product's success, its packaging must be attractive since that's the essence of beauty marketing. Package design must capture the imagination and be associated with enhancing appearance. One of the keys to attractive packaging is the artistic use of colors. Most relevant for the marketer is the outer secondary packaging. However, there are cosmetics which are distributed in one single cosmetic container. Creation of brand awareness Cosmetic packages must not only convey beauty, they must equate to brand awareness. Since the package is what the consumer initially sees, it is very influential in shaping perceptions about the product. Part of building brand awareness for a cosmetic product is associating it with emotion. Since it is not a survival product it is marketed to appeal to the desire to enhance appearance. The packaging must stimulate this emotion. Labelling Labels tell consumers what they need to know about the product, as far as how to use it and where it comes from. Companies must list the ingredients and the function of the product, especially when it is unclear. The label must contain the contact information of the entity responsible for putting the product on the market. Labels also provide product tracking information. The label must be easy to read, particularly for a customer where the product is being displayed. Certain compositions, such as perfumes, can be listed as one ingredient. Secondary packages are what the consumer sees as the outermost package. Primary packages are within the secondary package. Certain information can appear just on secondary packages. The most important information, particularly if the product is prone to misuse, must be displayed on both the primary and secondary packaging. =Information accuracy= One of the most important aspects of regulations on labeling is that the information is accurate. Although the FDA does not have the resources to inspect all cosmetic products on the market, it can issue penalties for various violations involving packaging and labeling. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to make sure that its product is safe for public consumption. =Avoidance of misleading information= None of the information, including name and address, may be misleading. Words can be abbreviated only if it is clear what they represent. All text must be printed clearly on the packaging. Smaller packages in which text is too difficult to read should include tags with legible text. =Listing of ingredients= Ingredients must be listed in a certain order with priority given to ingredients that represent 1% or more of the volume. These ingredients must be listed in descending order, based on weight. This group of ingredients is then followed by those that represent 1% or less of the product and listed in any order. Colorants may also be listed in any order. Packaging in multiple layers Many times cosmetic products are packaged in multiple layers. Whenever it is difficult to detect for the consumer, the number of units should be listed on the outer package, which should contain details about how to use the product and warnings on what to do if it is misused. It is essential that the product is protected from environmental elements such as mould and bacteria. The packaging must be sufficient enough to protect the mechanical, thermal, biological, and chemical properties of the product. It should also be strong enough to withstand human tampering and radiation damage. FDA and EU regulations The FDA oversees cosmetic packaging but does not test products. It leaves testing for safety up to manufacturers. It still provides regulations and can issue recalls when a product is associated with safety hazards. While the FDA does not have many restrictions on ingredients for cosmetic products, it does require that certain chemicals and colorants be listed. As far as EU regulations regarding packaging, manufacturers must be compliant with EC No. 1223/2009. One of these requirements involves the manufacturer issuing a safety report before putting the product on the market. The manufacturer must also disclose any serious undesirable effects (SUE) to the EU. Marketers are required to list nano- materials. The EU's definition of \\"ingredients\\" does not include raw or technical materials used in production that do not end up in the final product. In some cases when durability is an issue, the manufacturer must list an expiration date after the product has been opened. The words \\"best used before\\" are common for identifying the product expiration date. ISO- Standard Standard ISO 22715 provides specifications for the packaging and labeling of all cosmetic products that are sold or distributed at no charge; i.e. free samples. National regulations dictate what products are to be regarded as cosmetics. While ISO 22715 is not legally binding, national regulations regarding cosmetic products can be even stricter than those laid out in ISO 22715. The link between standards and regulations is that a standard often represents the common denominator of national law, as the standardization committee consists of members of most countries. Standards and regulations In addition to cosmetic containers meeting the requirements of ISO, they must also comply with regulations set by the European Union and the United States. Cosmetics products marketed in the EU must comply with the EU-Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cosmetic products. The entity that puts the product on the market, known as the \\"responsible person,\\" must prepare a product safety report for the EU. Manufacturers must notify the EU Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP) when they plan on putting products on the market. Some of the main EU requirements include identifying colorants and nanomaterials and disclosing serious undesirable effects (SUE) to the EU. The main issues to remember about labels on cosmetic containers is that they provide safety guidance, including instructions for use and proper disposal. In the United States, companies must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Although the FDA does exercise authority over the cosmetic industry, it does not allocate sufficient resources to constantly monitor the industry. ISO defines an ingredient as a material that makes up the final product and not necessarily raw materials used in the production of the product. While the FDA does not have strict requirements for ingredients, they must still be listed on the primary container or secondary package. Environmental Aspects The materials used for cosmetic containers are of concern for both protective and sustainable reasons. The container must protect the product from environmental elements and it must also move in the direction of eco-friendly solutions. In other words, the more the container can be recycled, the better for both the environment and cost efficiency. Some of the factors that affect container durability include how the product substance responds to usage, chemical composition and biology. It is essential that the container is able to withstand mold and mildew, as well as contaminants. The container must be made of materials resistant to hot or cold temperatures. It must also protect the product from ultraviolet rays, which can potentially damage the product. The container also cannot absorb product substances. Traditionally, plastic material or glass have been used to house cosmetics. Aluminum has become a popular type of container due to its lightweight yet sturdy quality, flexibility, durability and recyclability. A key factor in what type of material can be used for containers is how compatible the material is with the product. Plastic packaging materials are controversially discussed because of their polluting effects in particular to the marine environment. In 2014, a scientific study estimates the amount of floating plastics in the world's oceans to 5 trillion pieces with an accumulated weight of 250,000 tons.

Early years Roberts was born in the suburb of Taita, Lower Hutt, in Wellington. He was known by the nickname \\"Cocky\\". He was educated at Mount Cook School, Wellington.  Playing career  Roberts played for three clubs in total, during a career which spanned more than a decade. He made his provincial debut for Wellington as a 17-year-old. In 1896, Roberts played in the game for Wellington against the touring Queensland team. This game was won 49–7 and Roberts scored three tries. Roberts was then selected for the national side, in what was named an \\"unofficial\\" test against the Queensland visitors. This game was won 9–0. The next year, he played in the 1897 North against South Island match. He played an outstanding game and it was shock that he was not chosen immediately to tour Australia. However, he was later called into the squad as an injury replacement. He played the last six tour matches and this included scoring three tries in the second fixture against New South Wales. After the tour the team played the Auckland provincial side when they returned to New Zealand. The All Blacks lost 11–10. During the post- match gathering, Roberts and teammate Joe Calnan were suspended from playing any level of rugby for two seasons due to inappropriate behaviour. He never appeared for the national side again but continued playing club and provincial rugby until 1903.

He started out his playing career with the Sturgeons back in 2007 under their junior squad before officially being promoted into the team's professional roster sometime around the 2011-12 CBA season. During his first season as a professional, Zhao would be named a CBA All-Star for the Southern All-Stars team; he has since been named a CBA All-Star multiple times throughout his career. Because of that distinction, Zhao is considered to be a star player for Fujian alongside Wang Zhelin, who was previously drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2016 NBA draft. He had also previously participated in both the 2014 Asian Games and the 2015 FIBA Asia Championship, with the latter event having a national team that had most of its roster be 23 or younger entering the event.http://www.philstar.com/sports/2015/10/06/1507693/future-now-china The team had won the gold medal throughout that time, with Zhao having participation with the team as well. For Zhao's first two seasons with Fujian, he was able to start for every game with the team while also managing to improve on his point production and other major statistics between his first professional season and his second. However, during his third season, his production started to slip up a bit, due in part to him starting in less games with the Sturgeons with an injury he'd display sometime in the 2013-14 CBA season. Zhao's production would continue to slip under his next two seasons, even with him gaining more of a starting role again when compared to this third season in the CBA. He is currently projected to returning as a full-time starter again, with Zhao not only trying to help the team out in gaining more victories in the process, but also get back to the level he was at earlier on to the point of being on the Chinese national team.

His main business interest is as a strategic adviser to Intellicomm Solutions Private Ltd (India). He was the chairman of Wye Valley NHS Trust from June 2014 until October 2016 when he resigned. He was appointed Chair of the Pensions Advisory Service in February 2016. He was formerly Group Chairman of the Metropolitan Housing Partnership, a non-executive director of the schools regulator Ofsted, and a senior civil servant in the Cabinet Office and a board member of the Commission for Health Improvement. He was appointed a CBE in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to Diversity and to Equal Opportunities. Early life and education Museji was born in 1960 in Coventry. Museji is the son of Indian- immigrant Ahmed Suleman Takolia from the village of Jalalpur near Navsari, Gujarat in 1952. Married in 1987 to Noorjehan Ebrahim (divorced 2006) they have 3 children, Nadiya, Firdaus and Zainudeen. Museji lives in Gloucester. Public and Government Service He has served in diverse fields of public policy; advising on national policy developments in education (national reports on Muslim Education in the UK and Muslim Youth for the British Muslim Research Centre) and thereafter as a Secretary of State (Department of Education) appointee to the Board of the schools regulator OFSTED. In the field of health too he was appointed by the Secretary of State at the Department of Health to the board of the first inspector/regulator of the NHS in England – the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI). He also served as a non-executive director on the Board of his local Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and as Chairman of the Wye Valley NHS Trust which was taken out of Special measure under his leadership. Alongside this he served for five years as Chair of the Consumer/Members' Panel of the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) Corporation Pension Scheme delivering annual reports to the Secretary of State on the performance of this new intervention through auto-enrolment of workers. The reports of his Panel laid the foundation for stronger consumer focus and protection in auto enrolment. His growing credentials as a consumers' champion were recognised when Ian Duncan Smith MP, Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) appointed him to Chair of The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS). A position he held for less than a year, resigning after failing to resolve a personal business matter that led to bankruptcy. Museji's community work started with the highly innovative community enterprise in Bristol; the St Paul's based Centre for Employment and Enterprise Development (Charity) Limited. He went on to serve on the Advisory Board of 'The Smart Company' later part of Chime Communications and specialising on giving companies advice on corporate social responsibility where he served alongside Sir. Derek Wanless and Harriet Harman MP. In 1993 he was awarded the prestigious Commonwealth Fund Harkness Fellowship. The NHS: its costs and value Having served on the board of the national regulator of the NHS in England and two local NHS Trust boards Museji identifies the NHS in England as a victim of its own success. He was asked to lead the Wye Valley Trust during tough periods of the NHS. With huge cost pressures facing the NHS he entered the national debate about its cost and value by writing about how the NHS could save money. Faced with turning around a failing hospital, these challenges came into sharp focus. In 2015 writing jointly with the local MP for Hereford Jesse Norman he co-authored an article published by the Centre for Policy Studies \\"How Much Do We Use the NHS?\\" (Ref). In October 2016 shortly after his resignation, Wye Valley NHS Trust was taken out of \\"Special Measures\\" by the Care Quality Commission. Social Housing and community building His Harkness Fellowship had a special focus on American Community Development Corporations (CDCs). This inspired his vision for taking what he had earlier started building with the CEED Charity in Bristol to look to apply a similar model of partnership in the UK. After a period as Special Adviser to the President of the LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corporation) in New York, during which time he was member of a US delegation to No. 10 Downing Street, he moved onto the national stage in the UK when he was appointed Group Chairman of Metropolitan Housing Partnership or MHP in 2003. Muslim Affairs Museji has served as adviser to the Government, including to the Cabinet Secretary as well as to successive Secretaries General of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). He was as listed in the first 'Muslim Power 100' list published in 2007. Museji also advised on the implementation of the fledgling peace process in Northern Ireland (writing plans for and evaluating EU spending on rural communities), on urban planning and employment equity legislation in the Cape Metropolitan area of South Africa and finally, helped the FCO as a delegate on its international public diplomacy missions to Libya and India. In this latter context he has been called upon periodically to offer advice periodically on Muslim affairs in the UK. As a relatively widely travelled liberal Muslim he has garnered broad perspectives and insights on developments both at home and abroad. Expressing concerns about current government policy on British Muslims he has written thought provoking blogs for the UK Huffington Post following the Trojan horse affair in Birmingham, and latterly about the need for more tolerance as intra- ethnic politics from the Indian sub-continent creeps its way into British Asian communities. Business Affairs Since 2009 he was Executive Chairman of Intellicomm Solutions Limited. The business has grown and diversified from IT to travel services in the Indian market where it is operating successfully from Bangalore. He remains a strategic adviser. Between 2010 and 2016 he held various directionships from which he has now resigned, notably Invest Eq Property Management Partners Ltd, Mill House (General Buildings) LLP and Liver Homes (General Buildings) LLP. Museji was petitioned for bankruptcy following failed property investments.

It has smooth greyish bark that is shed in curly strips, linear to narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, long, spindle-shaped flower buds in groups of seven or nine, pale yellow or lemon-coloured flowers and conical, cylindrical or barrel-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus densa is a mallee or a mallet that typically grows to a height of and does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth. pale grey to cream-soloured bark that is shed in curly flakes. Its adult leaves are the same dull greyish green on both sides, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven or nine on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are shaped like a long spindle, long and wide with a horn-shaped operculum abour four times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between January and February or May to September and the flowers are pale yellow or lemon coloured. The fruit is a woody conical, cylindrical or barrel-shaped capsule with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus densa was first formally described in 1991 by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (densa) is a Latin word meaning \\"thick\\", \\"close\\" or \\"compact\\", referring to crown of this species. Brooker and Hopper also described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus densa subsp. densa \\\\- a short-trunked mallet with a dense crown, often to ground level; * Eucalyptus densa subsp. improcera \\\\- a mallee up to tall with slender stems. The subspecies name improcera is a Latin word meaning \\"short\\" or \\"undersized\\", referring to its stature compared to subspecies densa. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt is found on ridges, flats and drainage line areas of the southern Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it grows in clay, loam, sandy or lateritic soils. Subspecies densa is found between Ongerup, Ravensthorpe and Hyden and subspecies improcera in the Ravensthorpe and Jerramungup areas. Conservation status Both subspecies of E. densa are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

It is a meandering river that is fed by numerous named and unnamed becks and streams which flow over sandstone and limestone beds and an alluvia of sand, clay silt and gravel. The beck is known for flooding and in recent times has been a beneficiary of funding and experimental flood protection schemes. History The valley that Pickering Beck inhabits was carved by glacial melt water before the late Devensian period of history. It was initially thought to be a drainage channel for a glacial lake, either by two ice sheets abutting and the waters reaching the same height as the surrounding ice sheets (about above sea level), or as a simple drainage channel for the meltwater when the temperatures rose. Either way, the deep meandering channel has been estimated to have been carved by water flowing at per second (ten times the amount of water discharged by the Thames when it is in flood). The beck's source (Fen Bog) is at the watershed of two becks; this means that water coming off the moors flows either north (Eller Beck) or south (Pickering Beck). The source of the beck is also only west of the source of the River Derwent (Derwent Head), the river that the beck feeds into (via the Costa Beck at Wykeham) and the parent catchment that the beck comes under. The beck has been subject to flooding (particularly flash flooding in summer) since modern times. This is due to the steep sided valley that the waters run off of and into the beck. Because of the above average flooding suffered by Pickering (and elsewhere) in 2007, the town became a pilot in a government project known as Slowing the Flow. Slowing the Flow scheme With the new scheme, 129 Large Woody Debris (LWD) dams (or Leaky Dams) were installed which will allow slower moving water through, but retain fast headwaters attacking the dam head. Elsewhere, 187 heather bale check dams were constructed on the various smaller streams that feed into Pickering Beck to hold more water back. Additionally, a new floodplain was created to the north east of the town in area near to the hamlet of Newbridge known as Low Hunters Bridge. This floodplain and bund storage allows for of floodwater to be retained when the beck is in peak flow or under heavy rain conditions. The original plan was for two bunds that would store of water adjacent to the railway near to Newbridge. Modelling data suggested that a failure of the bunds would endanger public safety and a new scheme was devised that would fall under the Reservoirs Act 1975 making the new bund a Category A reservoir, and a clay bund was installed across the beck at Low Hunters Bridge. The bund extended to and at a height of above the land level. The outflow channel is subsurface to the beck and floodplain and this allows a maximum of per second out of the reservoir. This increased the money needed to be spent from £1.15 million to £3.2 million. Work was started on the scheme in 2014 and the project was officially unveiled by Secretary of State for the Environment Liz Truss in October 2015. In January 2016, Geoffrey Lean, an environmental journalist, wrote an article for The Independent stating that after significant rainfall, the bund had held the waters away from Pickering and saved the town from flooding, unlike York (a bare away). This prompted a response from Jeremy Biggs (director of the Freshwater Habitats Trust) who claimed that the catchment for Pickering was the driest place in Yorkshire over the Christmas and New Year Period for 2015 and 2016. The Meteorological Office data for the area showed a 150% above average rainfall in the area and Mike Potter, a Pickering Councillor, said it was very wet and Pickering was spared. Lean cites Bigg's evidence as skewed, including the fact that he quotes Westerdale weather data as his source. Westerdale is in another catchment area and is north of Pickering where the waters feed into the River Esk rather than Pickering Beck. The argument also continued in the locality where some have called for a flood wall to be installed in the town. The Environment Agency released figures in the Spring of 2016 that showed the defences put in place by the Slowing the Flow scheme had reduced the river peak flow by around 15-20%. Rainfall figures were recorded as being over a 36-hour period in Christmas 2015. However, one of the chairmen of the Slowing the Flow partnership cautioned that the defences would not be enough to prevent flooding on the scale that affected Pickering in 2007, and that an additional of floodplain would be needed. In April 2019, two Eurasian beavers were introduced into Cropton Forest north west of Pickering. The beavers will take part in the slowing the flow scheme and their natural engineering of dams will be assessed over a five-year period. Route The beck begins at Fen Bog (just west of the A169 road) but quite low in the narrow valley where the North Yorkshire Moors railway runs. It largely drains the southern part of Goathland Moor and the Saltersgate areas through Newtondale. It travels south westwards at first being fed by Thack Sike and numerous smaller watercourses spilling off the moorland before turning south at Carter House/North Dale and follows the same route as the railway in the narrow sided valley. It splits into two streams by Pifelhead Wood and goes westwards past Newton Dale Halt on the railway before turning south again at Kidstyke Farm and meanders south in varying degrees past Levisham and Farwath before heading west again into Newbridge and south into Pickering town. The beck flows under Bridge Street (a Grade II listed bridge), The Ropery and Hungate in the town centre before it heads mainly in a southerly direction and flowing into the Costa Beck east of Kirby Misperton. In the majority of the upper reaches (above Pickering), the beck takes a very meandering course through tracts of dense woodland. This is being remedied in some places to allow sunlight onto the beck. The lower reaches of the beck (south of Pickering) flow through a more arable and farmed landscape with crop growing and cattle rearing. Both Ryedale Council and the Environment Agency acknowledge Pickering Beck as being a main river. Hydrology Pickering beck is usually between and high in its normal range. The highest level ever recorded in Pickering was on 26 June 2007 when the river level was at 1:00 am. The town has been flooded on four occasions between 1999 and 2007 with the 2007 floods being most notable for the level of the flooding with an estimated £7 million worth of damages. The normal discharge flow from the beck is measured at per second measured from the gauging station at Ings Bridge which is a crump (triangular) weir. This is an average flow and does not represent flooding statistics as the gauging station is set in a floodplain and becomes ineffective when the river is flooded. Industrial history The builders of the Whitby and Pickering Railway, used the narrow valley at Newtondale that the beck inhabits to run their railway through. At Fen Bog, they had to float the railway on timber and sheep fleeces. Between the source of the Beck and Pickering, the beck flows under the railway six times and the railway shadows the beck all the way into Pickering. The beck was used to power several watermills in the town of Pickering, of which three are still standing; High Mill, Vivers Mill and Low Mill. The weir attached to Low Mill has a drop which is still a barrier to fish migration. Low Mill is now a private residence and has a Grade II listing attached to the building. High Mill was adjacent to the first railway station in Pickering and like Low Mill is now a private residence. The Bone Mill was adjacent to the right hand side of the beck by Southgate. It was demolished and a coal depot was used on the land, which became derelict. A supermarket now occupies the site. Vivers Mill has also been converted into a dwelling and remains Grade II listed. All mills, apart from the Bone Mill, were for corn milling. A trout farm was established beside the beck in 1971 as the cold, clean water was ideal for raising trout. The business built a lake between the two divided sections of the beck just north of Pickering railway station. Due to the owners retirement and a downturn in business, the lake will be tarmaced over to provide a 158 car park as an overflow for the railway business by the end of 2017. Ecology The upper reaches of the beck (above Pickering) are part of an SSSI site and additionally it flows through the North York Moors National Park. Fen Bog is a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Siltation prevention was undertaken on the beck in its lower reaches in 2014. The siltation near to Lendales Farm was due to cattle drinking and crossing the beck which allowed erosion to occur. Remediation works were undertaken to create a crossing point for the cattle without polluting the water. The bedrock of the beck flows mainly over the sandstone and limestone calcareous rocks (of the southern hills of the North York Moors) with loose accumulations of clay, silt, gravel and sand. The very upper reaches (source to Levisham Beck) are sandstone, the Middle portion is Corallian limestone (confluence of Levisham and Pickering Becks to Pickering) and the last section (the mainly agricultural reach south of Pickering) is on Kimmeridge Clay. The beck has wild trout and Grayling and whilst it is maintained and cared for by the Pickering Fisheries Association, there is no supplementary stocking of fish. Dace, chub, pike, minnows and brook lamprey have all been noted in its lower reaches. Access Pickering Fishery Association have the rights to fish on almost all of Pickering Beck. Above the town of Pickering, fly fishing is preferred where the beck is described as an infant stream. Below the town, the beck widens and has pools and riffles and is wider with improved accessibility. Newtondale has many access points, Newton Dale Halt railway station and Fen Bog being notable examples in the very upper reaches of the beck. A stretch of The Tabular Hills Walk runs alongside Levisham Beck (a feeder of Pickering Beck) and crosses Pickering Beck at Farwath.

It has spindly stems with smooth bark, linear to narrow elliptic adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, usually lemon- yellow flowers and conical to cup-shaped fruit. It is most common near Lake King. Description Eucalyptus depauperata is a mallee with spindly stems that typically grows to a height of but can be as tall as , and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth and pale grey to salmon-brown in colour. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are linear to oblong, long and wide on a short petiole. The adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, linear to narrowly elliptic, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are borne in leaf axils on a pendulous, flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are spindle- shaped, long and wide, with a blunt horn-shaped operculum that is two or three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs from September to November and the flowers are lemon-yellow, or sometimes pink-red. The fruits are woody, pendulous, conical to cup-shaped capsules that are long and wide on a pedicel long and contain dark brown flattened-ovoid shaped seeds. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus depauperata was first formally described by the botanists Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in 1992 in the journal Telopea. The type specimen was collected by Hill in 1988 near Lake King. The specific epithet (depauperata) is a mediaeval Latin word meaning \\"made poor\\", referring to the small habit, buds and fruits on this species. This species is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus in the section Bisectae and the subsection Glandulosae. It is closely related to E. eremophila, E. incerata and E. tenera. Distribution and habitat This mallee is found on sandplains and lateritic breakaways in the southern Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia. Its range extends from the southern wheatbelt, with large numbers around Lake King extending south-east to around Munglinup.

Sharda and Meena suddenly decide to leave India and settle down in a communist country, without letting Thakur know. Concerned about them, Thakur hires Jai, a spy, to locate them, and bring them back if possible. Jai agrees and soon arrives in that country, which is ruled by a military general who has not shown his face to anyone. Jai assumes the identity of Shinraaz, goes around trying to locate the two women, and finds Meena, who works as a dancer in a hotel. Jai eventually learns what brought Meena and her mother to this country, and why they both are not willing to return to India.

Soundtrack  The music was composed by the duo Shankar Jaikishan. Hasrat Jaipuri, S. H. Bihari, Indeevar and Kiran Kalyani were the lyricists.  Release and reception  Shatranj was an \\"anti-China movie\\", and theatres screening the film in West Bengal were burnt down by Communist revolutionaries. It was later forcibly removed from exhibition by the Government of that state. In Bathinda, Naxalites tried to blow up the theatre where the film was being screened, but the police successfully removed the bomb before it could do any damage. In a review dated 29 March 1969, the magazine Thought wrote, \\"Watching a game of shatranj, one needs some intelligence and common sense to follow the opponents' moves and countermoves. Watching Shatranj, the film, one has to suspend both intellect and [judgement].\\" The film was commercially successful but, according to Vasan's son Balan, \\"not to the extent expected by the maker\\".

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and nineteen, cream-coloured to pale yellow flowers and cup-shaped to barrel-shaped fruit.foliageflower budsflowersfruit Description Eucalyptus desmondensis is a slender, willowy mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth whitish or pale brown bark, sometimes a drooping crown, and glaucous branchlets. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross- section and egg-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, thick, the same glossy grey-green on both sides. They are lance- shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and nineteen on a flattened, glaucous, unbranched peduncle long. The individual buds are sessile or borne on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oval, non-glaucous, long and wide with a conical operculum that is slightly longer than the floral cup. Flowering mainly occurs between May and November and the flowers are cream-coloured to pale yellow. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to short barrel-shaped capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus desmondensis was first formally described in 1925 by Joseph Maiden and William Blakely from specimens collected by Charles Austin Gardner in 1924. The description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (desmondensis) refers to the locality Desmond, a former mining town near Ravensthorpe. The ending -ensis is a Latin suffix \\"denoting place, locality, or country\\". Distribution and habitat Desmond mallee is found on sandplains and rocky hillsides in a small part of the southern Goldfields- Esperance region of Western Australia centered around the Fitzgerald River National Park where it grows in stony clay, loam or sandy granitic based soils. It is most easily seen along the road between Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun. Conservation status Eucalyptus desmondensis is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. All known populations are on private property or on Crown land and none are in conservation reserves.

It was formed in 1987 by Mark Fleishman and Jennie Reznek who have since been the company's artistic directors. Besides creating original theatre productions, Magnet Theatre is actively engaged in youth development work in the Cape Town area as well as in the Cederberg Municipality. History Magnet Theatre was founded in 1987 to produce Cheap Flights (director: Roz Monat), starring Reznek. It re-emerged in 1991 to produce The Show's Not over 'Til the Fat Lady Sings (director: Mark Fleishman), again starring Reznek. The show toured nationally and internationally for two and a half years.Hutchinson, Yvette. Contemporary Collaborators II: Magnet Theatre. In: The Methuen Drama Guide to Contemporary South African Theatre. Martin Middeke, Peter Paul Schnierer (eds.). London, 2015. In 1994, Magnet Theatre returned to South Africa. For the next few years, the company focused mainly on its professional theatre productions. These included eight collaborations with Cape Town-based Jazzart Dance Theatre between 1994 and 2007 (including Medea, Rain in a Dead Man's Footprints, and Cargo); stage adaptations of Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1994) and Mia Couto's Voices Made Night (2000/01); two performance pieces with Jennie Reznek (1997/2002); and four outdoor productions between 1998 and 2011. In 1998, Magnet Theatre established the Magnet Theatre Educational Trust dedicating itself to training and developing skills for impoverished and marginalised youth. In 2001, Magnet Theatre initiated several youth development projects in addition to its theatre and performance productions. These include the Clanwilliam Arts Project (2001-2018); the Community Groups Intervention in Khayelitsha (2002-2007); the Community Arts Development in Clanwilliam (since 2007, which grew out of the Clanwilliam Arts Project); the Culture Gangs Project (since 2011); and the Farm Schools Project (since 2014). In 2006, Magnet Theatre produced Every Year, Every Day, I Am Walking (director: Mark Fleishman) for the African Festival of Youth and Children's Theatre. The piece about refugees in Africa subsequently toured five continents from 2007-2014 and was published in 2011Every Day, Every Year, I Am Walking. In: Spielplatz 24: Um die Welt.

In 2008, Magnet Theatre initiated a two-year Fulltime Training and Job Creation Programme. Since then, 58 trainees from townships in and around Cape Town have participated in the programme. As part of their training, each group of trainees has created several theatre productions. Among these are pieces in isiXhosa as well as a collaboration with the Cape Town Opera and young singers from the Cape Town Opera Studio (Heart of Redness, 2013). In 2013, Magnet Theatre initiated a creative focus on Early Years performance and training, developing performances for under seven-year-olds. Their first piece, TREE/BOOM/UMTHI (director: Jennie Reznek) toured the Cape Town townships, Italy, Germany, the UK, and the US. Since then Magnet Theatre has produced five new Early Years works that have been performed in crèches and aftercare centres in Cape Town, the Cederberg Municipality, and Okiep. One of the pieces, SCOOP: kitchen play for carers and babes (director: Koleka Putuma), was the first ever South African work for mothers/fathers and babies under the age of 12 months.

He had advised Mayanalla Devi, wife of Chaulukya ruler Karna, to take blessings from a hermit living on an island in the Rann of Kutch. She later gave birth to Jayasimha Siddharaja who named the place where he lived as Zinzuwada after him. The core town is surrounded by 11th century fort built during the rule of Chaulukya dynasty.

The event was launched as the Calgary Cup in 2009 and was initially held in Calgary, Alberta, but the tournament moved to Toronto, Ontario shortly after, returning to Calgary every few years. The Canada Cup is a major Street Fighter tournament, generally being the final event in the annual Capcom Pro Tour. Description Property manager and granite shop owner Lap Chi Duong organizes the Canada Cup fighting game event once a year. The Street Fighter tournament held at the Canada Cup has been a Premier Event of the Capcom Pro Tour since 2015. David \\"Atari\\" Bibona noted in 2014 that the Canada Cup is the biggest gathering of high-level Super Street Fighter II Turbo players, in part due to its international focus, allowing American players to compete with Japanese competitors, where Super Street Fighter II Turbo has a more active scene. Motherboard described the Canada Cup in 2016 as the \\"largest and most prestigious fighting game tournament in the country.\\" Daigo Umehara described the Canada Cup as one of his favorite tournaments to attend. History The Canada Cup started in 2009 as the Calgary Cup, held in Calgary rather than Toronto. The tournament was rebranded as the Canada Cup the following year as top Street Fighter players like Daigo Umehara and Justin Wong flew in to compete in the competition. In 2011, Duong decided to charge Twitch viewers of the tournaments $8.95 USD for commercial-free, high- definition livestreams, which became a running gag among the fighting game community. Duong moved the tournament to Toronto in 2012, though he had difficulty convincing sponsors and finding support. Duong stated in an interview with Motherboard that he had contacted 200 unique sponsors at the time, and only one responded positively: Mad Catz. The Cup moved back to Calgary for one year in 2014, which Duong noted as the first year it did not operate at a loss. 2015 In 2015, the Canada Cup became the final Premier Event of the Capcom Pro Tour season. The winner of its Super Street Fighter IV tournament automatically qualified for the 2015 Capcom Cup. 13 of the top 23 players in the Capcom Pro Tour rankings competed in the competition, and The Daily Dot described the Canada Cup as the \\"deepest tournaments of the season\\". The tournament was eventually won by Tokido, defeating Fuudo in the finale by playing Akuma with a solid ground game. 2016 Canada Cup 2016 hosted 14 tournaments. Duong invited high-level Super Smash Bros. players Armada, Hungrybox, and Mang0 through a publicity stunt, donating a large amount of money to their Twitch streams in order to contact them. The Canada Cup was again the final Street Fighter tournament of the Capcom Pro Tour, and became the first Premier Event in two years to have an American champion: Du \\"NuckleDu\\" Dang. 2017 Canada Cup was the final Street Fighter tournament of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour as well, besides the regional finals. The tournament was attended by players such as Daigo Umehara, Punk, NuckleDu, Yukadon and Problem X. The Canada Cup 2017 Street Fighter tournament was won by Dogura. The event also featured high-level tournaments for Tekken 7, Super Smash Bros. Melee, and Super Smash Bros. 4. A controversy was sparked when competitor Jose Aldape participated in the Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite tournament under two separate names. Aldape was initially eliminated from the tournament after losing during the \\"Battle for the Stones\\" qualifying round, but he reinserted himself in the competition the next day after a friend offered him her spot. Canada Cup organizers decided to replay the pool after a large portion of it had already been completed, and at least one player saw his accomplishments in the pool erased due to the mix-up. 2018 Canada Cup held in October 2018 was part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection Tournament Series, featuring a Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike tournament. The event was held at the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX) in Toronto. Canada Cup organizers said they were experiencing \\"major growing pains\\", and Chi Duong stated that \\"working in a convention space for the first year, it became quickly obvious that the trade off for a bigger production is losing the leniency you enjoy in a hotel conference setting.\\" One competitor found himself unexpectedly completely disqualified for the Ultra Street Fighter IV tournament for arriving ten minutes late, and the scheduled live broadcast of the Street Fighter V finals was abandoned due to delays and scheduling issues. 2019 The Canada Cup was again the final Capcom Pro Tour event in 2019, being held on November 1-3. The event returned to Calgary for the first time in four years, being held in the Deerfoot Inn. For the tenth anniversary of the tournament, Canada Cup 2019 had a $50,000 USD prize pool. Actor Cary Tagawa and voice actors Brian Drummond and Peter Kelamis were present at the event.

The kilns were fired by coal, and until the final years saggars were used.Medley, 117 A characteristic northern type of \\"horseshoe-shaped\\" or mantou kiln was used, named after the Chinese bun it resembles in shape; one of a group excavated at Yaozhou was unusually well- preserved, allowing accurate plans to be made.Medley, 117–118 Towards the end, after saggars were abandoned, a ring was left unglazed in the centre of vessels, which avoided pieces stacked directly in piles from sticking together, but detracts from their appearance.Medley, 117; Osborne, 187; Medley, 115 Bowls are the most common shape, but there are a wide range of others, including pillows, vases and ewers, and human and animal figurines. The shapes are elegant, and in early wares typically left undecorated. Then shallow carving was introduced, probably performed with a sharpened piece of bamboo, as well as incising and combing smaller details.Krahl, Osborne, 187; Medley, 115 Around the end of the Northern Song,Vainker, 114; Medley, 116 the kilns followed Ding ware in introducing the use of moulds for \\"impressed\\" decoration of the interior of the relatively flat shapes like bowls, and many complete moulds have been excavated. Moulds became the norm for these shapes, and were made using a turntable and a bat or paddle to force the clay into the design.Krahl, Osborne, 187; Medley, 115 Unlike Ding ware, where the introduction of moulds added many new motifs,Medley, 114 the Northern Celadon moulded designs were generally similar to the carved, but tended to be more complicated.Medley, 116 Distinguishing between the two techniques can be difficult, but one way is the small veins in leaves, which in carved examples are very often parallel lines made by a comb, which sometimes reach outside the edge of the leaf, but in moulded pieces vary their angles and width, and are neatly contained within the leaf's outline (contrasting examples illustrated).Koh Generally, the carved technique is preferred, as moulded designs tend to be \\"crowded and static\\".Vainker, 113 For vertical shapes such as vases and ewers a style of carving floral patterns in deeper relief was developed; these pieces may be known as Dong ware, though the term \\"has no archaeological foundation\\".Krahl The deeper relief allows similar levels of contrast in the design to the pooling effects on flat surfaces. History A typical Yaozhou design of scrolling foliage, accentuated by pooling of the glaze in the moulded depressions. Compare the carved bowl above. The Yaozhou Kiln complex, at Huangbaozhen just outside Tongchuan, Shaanxi, began production under the Tang dynasty, when it was notable for three-colour sancai earthenwares,Rawson, 231; Gompertz, 104; Map of the excavated areas at Huangbaozhen but produced black wares and other types as well.Vainker, 112 The kiln was some 70 miles from Chang'an (modern Xi'an), capital of the Tang until 904. Although considerably further from Kaifeng, which became the capital of the Song in 960,Kaifeng had also been capital of the local states of the Five Dynasties: as Bian it was the capital of the Later Jin (936–946), Later Han (947–950), and Later Zhou (951–960) of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Yaozhou benefited from the move, as the previous main high-quality celadon Yue ware, from further south, declined.Yutaka Mino, \\"Yue wares\\", section in \\"China, §VIII, 3: Ceramics: Historical development\\", Oxford Art Online; Rawson, 369 Yaozhou ware was considerably influenced by Yue ware, although the green colour was darker, and the designs usually carved, and later moulded, rather than incised as in Yue ware.Gompertz, 106–107; Vainker, 112; but see Medley, 115–116 At the end of the Northern Song in 1125, the remainder of the Imperial court fled south, and the capital of the Southern Song was set up at Hangzhou. The nearby Longquan celadon kilns became the main producer of celadon and Yaozhou and the other Northern Celadons declined accordingly, in both quantity and quality, although celadons continued to be produced at Yaozhou until the Yuan dynasty.Rawson, 369; Gompertz, 125; Valenstein, 95 After the fall of the Northern Song, Yaozhou itself was ruled by the invading Jin dynasty (1115–1234). It was at this time that the poet Lu You (1125–1209), a refugee from the north as a baby, wrote that Yaozhou greenwares \\"are extremely coarse and are used only by restaurants because they are durable\\".Quoted in Vainker, 112 This had not always been the case; in the period 1078 to 1106 there are records of Yaozhou presenting wares to the Northern Song court, perhaps filling in a gap in imperial wares of choice as Ding ware began to decline and Ru ware had not been developed.Vainker, 112 Yaozhou wares do not seem to have been exported in great quantities, unlike some contemporary and earlier wares, but some fragments have been found in Indonesia and Vietnam.Koh Fragments have also been found in the Aljafería, an 11th-century Islamic palace in southern Spain.Archaeological paper in Spanish, 2003, p. 262 Northern Celadon pieces have been excavated from Korean tombs, but none found in Japan. Finds have been made along the Silk Road, and at the Islamic capitals of Fustat near Cairo and Samarra in Iraq.Gompertz, 125 File:Grès chinois Guimet 231104.jpgStatuette of a lion, Yaozhou, Northern Song File:Grès chinois Guimet 231105.jpgBowl with carved design, Northern Song File:Incense Burner (Lu) with Flower Petals LACMA M.57.13.3.jpgIncense burner, 11th century, Henan File:Yaozhou ware mould, China, N.

Two days later, the government responded by bringing to Parliament the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 for first reading in the House of Commons on 26 January 2017. The case is informally referred to as \\"the Miller case\\" or \\"Miller I\\" (to differentiate with Miller's later Brexit- related case against the Government, Miller II). The Supreme Court's decision was given on appeal from the High Court's ruling that the Crown's foreign affairs prerogative, which is exercised by the government led by the Prime Minister, may not be used to nullify rights that Parliament has enacted through primary legislation. The case was seen as having constitutional significance in deciding the scope of the royal prerogative in foreign affairs. The Supreme Court also ruled that devolved legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have no legal right to veto the act. The government's appeal was against the High Court order dated 7 November 2016 that formally declared: \\"The Secretary of State does not have power under the Crown's prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union.\\" The Supreme Court heard the appeal from 5 December 2016 to 8 December 2016, and, by a majority of 8–3, upheld the High Court ruling, finding that authorisation by Parliament was required for the invocation of Article 50. The case was intervened by the Lord Advocate and the Counsel General for Wales for the Scottish and Welsh governments (respectively as the Scottish and Welsh Ministers), and applicants for judicial review in Northern Ireland also had their three separate applications considered together with this case, all of whom argued that the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly all had to consent to the invocation of Article 50. In each case this was unanimously rejected by the court. Facts Following a referendum held on 23 June 2016, in which 51.9% of votes cast were in favour of leaving the EU, the UK government stated its intention to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (the formal procedure for withdrawing) on 29 March 2017. On the Monday following the referendum, three academics (Nick Barber, Dr Tom Hickman and Professor Jeff King) published a blog which argued that an Act of Parliament would be necessary before the Government could give notice to leave the EU. A few days later David, Lord Pannick QC, a columnist for The Times, asked whether an Act of Parliament was needed before notification could lawfully be given of the UK's intention to leave, and cited the arguments of Barber, Hickman and King in agreeing with them that an Act of Parliament was required. The government argued that the use of prerogative powers to enact the referendum result was constitutionally proper and consistent with domestic law whereas the opposing view was that the exercise of prerogative powers would undermine the European Communities Act 1972 and would set aside rights previously established by Parliament. Arguments Gina Miller and other claimants had sought permission to bring an action in the High Court for judicial review on whether the UK government was entitled to notify an intention to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), as amended (the Maastricht and Lisbon Treaties), without a vote or deliberative debate in Parliament. David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, argued that the possibility to trigger Article 50 was based on the royal prerogative and so any consultation of elected members of parliament was unnecessary. Miller contended that, if notification under Article 50 were to be invoked to leave the European Union, it would effectively nullify a series of Acts of Parliament. It was a constitutional principle that Acts of Parliament could not be changed without the consent of Parliament. The Secretary of State did not contend that the Referendum Act 2015 supplied a statutory power for the Crown to give notice under Article 50.R. (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. The Court observed that he was right not to do so, because any argument to that effect would have been untenable as a matter of statutory interpretation of the 2015 Act and stated:  High Court judgment = Background  There was dispute over whether the decision to invoke Article 50 was the prerogative of the government, as the Cameron government argued, or whether it required parliamentary approval. Article 50 states that \\"Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements\\". As Professor Kenneth Armstrong (Professor of EU law at Cambridge University) points out this is a decision solely for domestic law: whether constitutional requirements have been met is a matter solely for the domestic law of member states. The UK's constitutional requirements for the valid invocation of Article 50 was the entire basis of this litigation, even though this was undertaken without explicit reference to that phrase as in Art 50(1) in the judgments. As will be seen below, it was held that the UK constitutional requirements were that an Act of Parliament need be passed in order to bestow the power on the Secretary of State to invoke Article 50, as the European Communities Act 1972 had displaced the Royal prerogative to take the UK outside of the EU treaties. The first of the parties to lodge a complaint in the proceedings against the government's intention to trigger Article 50 without a parliamentary vote was Deir Dos Santos, who launched his action four days after the referendum of 23 June. Miller's claim form was served on 29 July 2016. The law firm Mishcon de Reya announced that it had been retained by a group of clients to challenge the constitutionality of invoking Article 50 without Parliament debating it. In the proceedings, all parties accepted that withdrawal from the European Union would have profound consequences in terms of changing domestic law in each of the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.[2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin). para.4 At the preliminary hearing on 19 July 2016, Sir Brian Leveson, President of the Queen's Bench Division, stated that the court gave leave to Dos Santos to stay his proceedings and join as an interested party in Miller's case, and others, such as a group of unnamed clients who were separately represented, would have the option to be interested parties in the claim or interveners. At the hearing, lawyers for the government confirmed that the government would not issue an Article 50 notification before the end of 2016. In the court proceedings, the government contended that it would be constitutionally impermissible for the court to make a declaration in terms that the government could not lawfully issue notification under Article 50 unless authorised by an Act of Parliament, and stated that the declaration now being opposed would trespass on proceedings in Parliament. SSExEU, paras. 8(3), 62 citing R (Wheeler) v Office of the Prime Minister [2008 EWHC 1409 (Admin), and 64 citing R (Wheeler) v Office of the Prime Minister [2014] EWHC 3815 (Admin). Questions were also raised over the impartiality of Lord Neuberger by Brexit MPs and The Daily Telegraph, as his wife had made a series of tweets criticising Brexit. These allegations were countered by his spokesman, who said that Neuberger's wife's personal views had no effect on Neuberger's ability to interpret the law.  Hearing  At the full hearing in October, before three judges sitting as a divisional court (the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and Lord Justice Sales), it was argued for the lead claimant (Miller) that notification under Article 50 would commit the UK to the removal of rights existing under the European Communities Act 1972 and later ratification acts, and that it is not open to the government, without Parliament's approval, to use the prerogative power to take action affecting rights which Parliament had recognised in that way. An argument put for the \\"expat\\" Interveners at the hearing was that by the 1972 Act, Parliament had conferred a legislative competence on the EU institutions, and in that way had changed the constitutional settlement in the UK. Responding in the opening submissions for the government, the Attorney-General (Jeremy Wright) outlined how the decision had been reached. In support of the contention that when passing the 2015 Act Parliament well knew of the Article 50 procedure for leaving the European Union if that was voted for in the referendum, he said that Parliament had previously dealt with it when the Lisbon Treaty was included in domestic law by the 2008 Act, and he took the court through the legislation dealing with the European Union and its predecessor, namely: *European Communities Act 1972 (before the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties came into force in 1980) *European Assembly Elections Act 1978 *European Communities (Greek Accession) Act 1979 *European Assembly Elections Act 1981 *European Communities (Spanish and Portuguese Accession) Act 1985 *European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986 *European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993Text of European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 *European Union (Accessions) Act 1994 *European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 *European Union (Accessions) Act 2003 *European Union (Accessions) Act 2006 *European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 *Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 *European Union Act 2011 *European Union (Croatian Accession and Irish Protocol) Act 2013 *European Union Referendum Act 2015. In further submissions for the government, the lead claimant's primary argument was said by Treasury Counsel (James Eadie) to be that it is not open to the executive to use the prerogative power in such a way as to affect or change current economic law, principally statute law; but the government contended that the leading case Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel meant that the question about the use of the royal prerogative depended on Parliament's legislative intention. The treaty ratification provisions of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 were in force from 11 November 2010,The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2010. that is, after the Lisbon Treaty, including Article 50, was ratified for UK on 16 July 2008, and had come into force on 1 December 2009. While the Act describes \\"treaty\\" as an agreement between states, or between states and international organisations, which is binding under international law, including amendments to a treaty, and defines \\"ratification\\" as including acts (such as notification that domestic procedures have been completed) which establish as a matter of international law the United Kingdom's consent to be bound by the treaty, ratification of an amendment to a European Union treaty may involve compliance with the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008, and there are further provisions under the European Union Act 2011. The Lord Chief Justice described the statutory procedure as \\"of critical importance\\". The hearing was concluded on 18 October, when the Lord Chief Justice said the judges would take time to consider the matter and give their judgments as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the applications of other parties challenging the government in legal proceedings in Northern Ireland's High Court were dismissed on 28 October, but the court was prepared to grant leave to appeal in respect of four out of the five issues.R (on the application of Agnew and others) v Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.  Judgment  The court's unanimous judgment was delivered and published on 3 November. The decision was against the government's contention that the Crown's prerogative allowed giving Article 50 notice, and the court would later decide on the form of declaration it would make. The court described the passing of the European Communities Act 1972 as the major step of \\"switching on the direct effect of EU law in the national legal systems\\", and reasoned that it is implausible that Parliament's intention was that the Crown should be able to switch it off unilaterally by exercise of its prerogative powers. The judgment stated that the question for the court's decision involved the constitutional law of the United Kingdom: it was whether the Crown's executive government is entitled to use the Crown's prerogative powers to give notice under Article 50 for the United Kingdom to cease to be a member of the European Union.[2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin). The court held that the Government had no power to trigger notification under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), because it would remove a series of rights created by Acts of Parliament. The principle of parliamentary sovereignty required that only Parliament could take away those rights. This is expressed in the Case of Proclamations (1608), the Bill of Rights 1688 section 1, and continually confirmed since in cases including Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate,[1965] AC 75 and R (Jackson) v Attorney General.[2005] UKHL 56, [9] The Crown may not alter the domestic law of the UK or modify rights conferred by Parliament.[2016] EWHC 2768 , [86]-[88] Three categories of rights were :(i) rights that could be replicated by UK law (e.g. 28 days paid holidays under the Working Time Directive 2003), :(ii) rights of UK citizens in other EU member states (e.g. the right to work abroad, or set up a business, under TFEU articles 45 and 49) and :(iii) rights that could not be replicated in UK law (e.g. the right to vote in the EU Parliament or petition the EU Commission to enforce competition law or environmental law standards in the UK).[2016] EWHC 2768 , [58]-[61] While the Secretary of State accepted that category (iii) rights would be nullified, the High Court also ruled that all rights in categories (i) and (ii) would also be jeopardised in their effectiveness.[2016] EWHC 2768 , [63]-[66] The case had come before the court as a \\"rolled up\\" hearing, so that both the application for permission to seek judicial review and the substantive merits of the claim were considered at the hearing. Formally, this meant that permission for full judicial review on the substantive merits was granted.[2016] EWHC 2768 , [110] The High Court order dated 7 November 2016 declared: \\"The Secretary of State does not have power under the Crown's prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union.\\"In the Supreme Court, Written Case for Birnie and others (the \\"Expat Interveners\\") para. 2.  Press reaction  The Sun, The Daily Telegraph, the Daily Express and the Daily Mail on 4 November 2016, the day after the High Court decision The High Court decision was met with mixed views in the daily press. The Daily Telegraph commented that the High Court ruling increased the prospect of an early general election, while the Financial Times and The Guardian reported the case as a \\"blow\\" or a \\"setback\\" to the UK government plans. The financial markets reacted by an increasing exchange rate for the pound sterling against the euro and the dollar, on speculation of a delayed or softer Brexit. Other news media attacked the presiding judges and questioned their impartiality, the Daily Mail calling them \\"enemies of the people\\", and on its website describing one judge as \\"an openly gay ex-Olympic fencer\\". The Guardian reported that MPs condemned newspaper attacks on the judges after their Brexit ruling. Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon condemned personal attacks from newspapers on the judges, describing them as \\"hysterical\\", and called on Lord Chancellor Liz Truss to speak out and protect them. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve described the attacks as \\"entirely unjustified\\", and said that \\"[t]here seems to be a paranoid hysteria around that this is being done [to reverse] the referendum. But it's simply that there has to be a process followed if parliament is to give effect to and express the wish of the electorate.\\" Brendan Cox, widower of Jo Cox, also expressed concern. The General Council of the Bar also called on Truss to condemn the attacks. The oath of office (prescribed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005) obliges a Lord Chancellor to respect the rule of law and defend the independence of the judiciary. On 5 November 2016, Truss issued a statement in which she said: \\"The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality.\\" Her statement was in turn criticised as belated and inadequate. The oath of office for judges obliges them to \\"well and truly serve\\" the Queen and \\"do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages\\" of the realm \\"without fear or favour, affection or ill will\\". The Telegraph, in an editorial on 5 December 2016, expressed its regret that the High Court had heard the application at all, \\"instead of deciding that it was not the business of the judiciary to get involved in what is essentially a political matter\\" and its concern that \\"by upholding the lower court's ruling, the Supreme Court justices could find themselves dictating to Parliament – an inversion of the normal constitutional order, with potential consequences for the notion that Parliament is sovereign and thus supreme\\". The Guardian commented on 5 December 2016 that the unprecedented number of the panel of eleven justices who would be hearing the appeal and deciding the case was recognition of the constitutional significance and political sensitivity of the appeal. Appeal to Supreme Court The case, involving the government's appeal from the High Court of England and Wales and two references from Northern Ireland, was the first ever to be heard en banc by the full court (eleven justices, there being one vacancy). The Court scheduled the four days between 5 and 8 December 2016 for the hearing.Theresa May issues a staunch defence of the free press after media coverage of Brexit ruling The Daily Telegraph, 6 November 2016.Brexit court ruling appeal date set for 5 December BBC, 8 November 2016 Judgment was delivered on 24 January 2017. By a majority of the justices, the Supreme Court, with three dissenting, dismissed the government's appeal from the High Court, finding that an Act of Parliament was required to invoke Article 50. In advance of appeal hearing For the Scottish government, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told the Lord Advocate to apply to join the case. Sturgeon maintained it \\"simply cannot be right\\" for EU rights to be \\"removed by the UK Government on the say-so of a Prime Minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent\\". She argued further that \\"legislation should be required at Westminster and the consent of the Scottish Parliament should be sought before Article 50 is triggered\\".Nicola Sturgeon launches plan to stop Theresa May overturning Brexit legal challenge The Independent, 10 November 2016' On 18 November the Supreme Court announced that the Attorney General for Northern Ireland had made a reference to the court regarding devolution issues relating to that jurisdiction and that the court had granted the applications of four interveners to take part in the appeal, namely: *The Lord Advocate (James Wolffe), Scottish Government *The Counsel General for Wales (Mick Antoniw), Welsh Government *The \\"Expat Interveners\\" – George Birnie and others *The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain.Supreme Court, R. (on the application of Miller & Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union The BBC reported that the Lord Advocate would be addressing the court on Scots law, and the Welsh Counsel General's submissions would be addressing the court on the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty. Speaking on 9 November, Lady Hale, deputy president of the Supreme Court, stated that the issue in the case to be heard on appeal by the Court in December was whether giving Article 50 notification was within the Crown's prerogative powers for the conduct of foreign relations or whether the prerogative cannot be used in a way that undermines an act of the United Kingdom Parliament.The Supreme Court: Guardian of the Constitution?

In the appeal the government argued that, while Parliament's enactment of the European Communities Act 1972 was necessary to prevent the UK breaching the EEC treaties when they came into force on 1 January 1973, the 1972 act was a legal precondition neither for the signature nor for the ratification of the Treaty of Accession, nor for the treaty coming into force in respect of the UK. Intervening for the Scottish government, the Lord Advocate stated as background that the UK \\"acceded to the constitutional order of the Communities\\" when joining on 1 January 1973 and argued that \\"[t]he purported giving of notification under Article 50 TEU by unilateral act of [the UK government] would be unlawful\\" because it would (inter alia) * be contrary to provisions of the Acts of Union of 1706 and 1708; and * circumvent the requirements of established constitutional convention. Before the hearing, the Supreme Court invited the public to view video footage of the entire proceedings, and provided on its website a page headed \\"Article 50 'Brexit' Appeal\\" with multiple links, giving a brief explanation of the issues to be considered and other information, and stating that in addition to live video feeds and 'on demand' catch-up video of each court session, transcripts would be available at the website on a half-daily basis (morning session by 4 pm, afternoon session around 7 pm).Access to the Supreme Court building: Article 50 'Brexit' case, 5–8 December 2016.

The Daily Telegraph commented that ministers had accused the judges of relegating the referendum vote to a footnote, and backing the claim that a vote from the House of Commons and House of Lords was now needed before UK and EU talks began.The Telegraph, Government warns Brexit vote must not be relegated to a 'footnote' ahead of Supreme Court hearing, 9.42 am 3 December. An opinion stated in a BBC website article (3 December 2016) was that there was little expectation of the High Court's ruling being reversed by the Supreme Court. Another BBC webpage summed up the Scottish government's contention, against the UK government's appeal, as arguing that the triggering of Article 50 will affect Scotland in a way that requires the involvement of the Scottish Parliament in the process.  Appeal and references heard together  The Supreme Court listed the appeal as R (on the application of Miller and Dos Santos) (Respondents) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (Appellant) to be heard together with Reference by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland – In the matter of an application by Agnew and others for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland) and Reference by the Court of Appeal (Northern Ireland) – In the matter of an application by Raymond McCord for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland). The daily sessions of the hearing began on Monday 5 December. In the UK government's appeal from the High Court, the UK law officers and others, acting for the Secretary of State as the appellant, were instructed by the Government Legal Department; and the two respondents, Miller and Dos Santos, were represented by barristers and solicitors acting for them separately. Others listed as participating in the hearing were: *Attorney General for Northern Ireland *lawyers acting in NI Reference (Agnew and others) *lawyers acting in NI Reference (SoS Northern Ireland) instructed by Crown Solicitor's Office *lawyers acting in NI Reference (McCord) *1st interested party, Pigney and others *2nd Interested Party, AB and others *1st Intervener, Birnie and others *2nd Intervener, Lord Advocate instructed by Scottish Government Legal Directorate *3rd Intervener, Counsel General of Wales Instructed by Welsh Government Legal Services Department *4th Intervener, TWGB (written submissions only) *5th Intervener, Lawyers of Britain (written submissions only). The Court published a table setting out the time allotted for the hearing of the oral arguments of the parties' advocates in the four days, Monday 5 to Thursday 8 December: *First day, and morning of second day: for the Appellant (Attorney-General, Jeremy Wright; Treasury Counsel, James Eadie; Advocate General for Scotland, Lord Keen of Elie), *Second day, afternoon: for the NI Attorney General (on reference from NI High Court), followed by for Respondent Miller. *Third day: for Respondent Miller (continued), followed by for Respondent Dos Santos, followed by for Applicants Agnew and McCord, followed by for the Scottish government. *Fourth day: for the Scottish government (continued), followed by for the Welsh government, followed by for Interested Parties Graham Pigney and others, followed by for Interested Parties AB, KK, PR and children, followed by for George Birnie and others, followed by for the Appellant in reply. The hearing Before calling on the Attorney General to open the case for the government as Appellant, the Supreme Court President stated the justices were aware of the strong feelings associated with the many wider political questions surrounding the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, but the appeal was concerned with the legal issues, and their duty was to consider those issues impartially and decide according to the law. He mentioned that all the parties involved in the proceedings had been asked whether they wished any of the justices to stand down, and each of them had stated that they had no objection to any of the eleven sitting on the appeal. At the start of the government's oral submissions, the Attorney-General said the claimants had brought High Court proceedings perfectly properly and it was now perfectly proper for the Supreme Court to decide the appeal. The Appellant's submissions, apart from devolution issues to be addressed later by the Advocate General for Scotland, were summed up on the morning of the second day in a series of points: *As Parliament knows today and knew in 1972, the Crown prerogative to make and unmake or withdraw from treaties exists as a key part of the UK constitution. *Parliament has deliberately regulated some parts of those prerogative powers, expressly and in detail, but it has not touched the power to give Article 50 notice. *There is no basis for imposing a hidden legislative presumption on Parliament's intention: the rights in question in this case are created on the international plane, and then recognised by UK law; EU rights on that plane are altered and removed through the Crown's prerogative powers, and that is a \\"significant step along the road to finding the intention in relation to withdrawal\\". *The courts should be wary of going over the line between interpretation of legislation and judicial legislation, in a way which would impose \\"a new control of a most serious kind in a highly controversial and, by Parliament, carefully considered area\\". *The 2015 Act and the referendum emphatically undermine a suggestion that giving Article 50 notice by use of the prerogative power could be other than consistent with the will of Parliament. Following on, the Advocate General for Scotland ended his oral submissions for the Appellant by saying that if an exercise of the royal prerogative to take the UK out of the EU were seen as an abuse of power after the 1972 Act, there could be no such abuse after the Referendum Act 2015 and the result of the referendum was known: \\"It is simply a question of whether it would be proper and appropriate for the executive to exercise the prerogative in particular circumstances, and the circumstances that we have to address are those which exist today in light of the 2015 Act, which is of considerable constitutional importance and the decision made in the referendum, knowing that if Parliament wanted to intervene and limit the exercise of that prerogative right, it is free to do so and has chosen to remain silent.\\" For the Respondent Miller it was argued that the Court should not accept that the legal limits on ministers' powers are to be left to or influenced by political control, or parliamentary control, short of an act of Parliament. For the Respondent Dos Santos it was submitted that the legislature could easily have said what effect the 2015 referendum was if it wanted to tell us, but it has not told us, and the courts should not try and guess what the legislature intended, but instead leave it to the legislature to decide; and that, as there is no parliamentary authorisation for the loss of rights resulting from withdrawal from the EU, whether under the 2015 Act, or any other legislation which has been passed by Parliament, the government's appeal should be dismissed. The Welsh Government submitted that the UK Government's proposed Article 50 notification would be an unlawful dispensation by the Crown of the provisions establishing the competence of the Welsh Assembly. In response to submissions of parties opposing the appeal and questions put by the Justices, it was said for the government that the question before the court was about \\"the present state of the division of responsibility between our pillars of state, legislative, executive, and indeed judicial, and that demands a current answer and not a historic one\\"; and that parliament's legislation was to implement UK treaty obligations, not to control the government's exercise of the royal prerogative on the international plane. Closing the hearing, the Court President said that the appeal raised important constitutional issues, and the Justices would take time to give full consideration to the many arguments presented to them, orally and in writing, and they would do their best to resolve the case as quickly as possible. Judgment The Supreme Court held by eight judges to three that only Parliament could authorise a notification under TEU Article 50 to be given to the European Commission, upholding the High Court.See in the media, However, all judges found unanimously that neither the Sewel Convention, nor the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Good Friday Agreement, legally required the consent of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly to trigger article 50. The majority judgment said the following. Significance After the government's appeal was dismissed, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU formally introduced in Parliament, on 26 January 2017, a bill that, on 16 March, was enacted without amendment as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. The act's long title is To Confer power on the Prime Minister to notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the EU. The act's two sections are to confer on the Prime Minister the power of giving the notice that the Treaty requires to be given when a member state decides to withdraw.

More information here. Mercy Seiradaki (née Money-Coutts; 16 April 1910 – 1 September 1993) was a British archaeologist who worked in Crete in the 1930s, mostly on projects led by John Pendlebury, including excavations at Knossos. She co-authored several reports on the work undertaken with him and published a later key text on the pottery from Karphi in 1960. During the war she worked at Bletchley Park, and then joined the Red Cross. She worked with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Crete in the post-war years and lived in Greece for the rest of her life.  Personal life  Mercy Burdett Money- Coutts was born on 16 April 1910 in Devon into an upper-class family, the only daughter of Hester Frances née Russell and Hugh Burdett Money-Coutts, later Baron Latymer. Unsurprisingly for a girl of her background, she was privately educated at home and presented at court before going to Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford University, and she entered enthusiastically into traditional English field sports. This background developed certain qualities helpful to her later work in archaeology. As well as being well-read and skilled in drawing, she built up physical stamina while deer stalking. When, at the age of 37, she married Michael Seiradakis, a Cretan from an ordinary village background, her parents did not go the wedding, though a conventional announcement appeared in The Times.  Education and work  After graduating in Modern History in 1932 she asked Arthur Evans to accept her as a student helper at Knossos. Evans had led this major project for decades but by this time excavations were directed by John Pendlebury, who became a mentor to Seiradaki. As well as excavating he undertook a major reorganisation of the on-site Stratigraphical Museum, a task in which Seiradaki would take a large part. She was accepted as a student of the British School at Athens at the same time as Edith Eccles who became a friend with whom she worked and travelled. Her endurance and stamina on difficult journeys over mountain tracks were noteworthy. There were several young women archaeologists from the UK and all were determined not to be put off by difficult terrain and challenging routes, and yet Seiradaki stood out for her reluctance even to ride a mule instead of walking. After a winter in Athens studying prehistoric pottery she and Eccles went to Crete to help complete the catalogue of the museum at Knossos. Pendlebury and his wife worked to date one third of a huge collection of sherds assembled in 2000 boxes. Eccles and Seiradaki dated the rest and published the results in instalments. They also went on several expeditions in central Crete, often with Pendlebury, seeking out new sites and checking on some already discovered. This led to Pendlebury's book the Archaeology of Crete in which half of the illustrations were drawn by Seiradaki, particularly the drawings of seal stones and pottery patterns. In 1934 she explored a variety of archaeological sites in the Peloponnese and other parts of mainland Greece, and returned to Crete in 1935. She continued to work in association with Pendlebury: in particular around Lasithi in central Crete. She excavated, helped publish, and also took opportunities to travel with Eccles. Some of her travel was to the Middle East and Egypt to explore links between Minoan and Oriental cultures. Although Arthur Evans' visits to Knossos had become less frequent in the 1930s, he knew enough about her work to give her the role of organising the Knossos section of a London exhibition celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the British School, and of helping with a further display at the Ashmolean. He also used one of her drawings of a hoard of axes to illustrate his last work on the palace at Knossos. When the cave at Trapeza was excavated she was responsible for the pottery and the challenge of dating it. She produced an extensive illustrated and descriptive catalogue of pottery and other smaller finds. About three quarters of the work published about the cave is by Seiradaki. She did similar work for other excavations run by Pendlebury in Lesithi, publishing as M. Money-Coutts. The work at Karphi was fully completed in 1960 when she published Pottery from Karphi under the name Mercy Seiradaki. She was whole-hearted not only about her work but also about life on Crete. She learned modern Greek, got to know the island, its people and culture and was known for her ability to get on with local workers on site. In this way, she can be seen as a pioneer of contemporary approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists. In the early years of the Second World War she worked, probably as a secretary, at Bletchley Park, the secret code breaking establishment. In 1944 she joined the Red Cross and was sent to Egypt. She is presumed to have wanted to return to Crete where some of the men she knew had worked with the Resistance, as did many academics associated with the British School at Athens. She and Eccles managed to travel from Libya to Crete in 1944 when the island was still considered dangerous. After her friend left for Athens she stayed on in Crete working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was awarded the bronze medal of the Greek Red Cross for her courage, and became a local heroine. Through UNRRA she met her husband who received many honours for acts of wartime bravery.  Later life  After marrying and having a son (John Hugh Seiradakis, astronomer) and daughter (Sophia Hester) she lived in Crete until 1962. She continued her Red Cross work, her involvement with archaeology on the island, and offered \\"open house\\" hospitality to English-speaking visitors.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, yellow to yellowish green flowers and cylindrical to hemispherical fruit with a flange near the rim.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus dielsii is a mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. The bark is smooth dark grey bark that reveals fresh brownish and greenish bark when shed. The adult leaves are the same glossy green colour on both sides and lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of seven on a pendulous, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are cylindrical to oval, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been observed in November and January and the flowers are yellow to yellowish green. The fruit is a woody cylindrical to hemispherical capsule with a flange around the rim, giving the fruit a shape resembling a bowler hat. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus dielsii was first formally described by the botanist Charles Austin Gardner in 1926 and the description was published in Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The type specimen was collected by William T. Brown in 1925 near Salmon Gums. The specific epithet (dielsii) honours the German botanist Friedrich Ludwig Emil Diels \\"who travelled all the way to Western Australia and gave so much to the history of the botany of this region\\". Distribution and habitat Cap- fruited mallet is found in shrubland between Lake King, Ravensthorpe and Salmon Gums in the southern Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia where it grows in clay or sandy soils. It can tolerate acidic or basic soils and is both drought and frost tolerant. Conservation status Eucalyptus dielsii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The commercially available plant is sold as seed or tube stock. It is planted as a windbreak and for erosion control as is known to attract birds.

A private residence since 1805, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The former Hathaway's Tavern house stands near the northern city limit of St. Albans, on the east side of North Main Street south of Lakeview Terrace. The building is prominently situated on top of a low knoll near the road, a contrast to both surrounding commercial development to the north and west, and to residential development to the south that is generally set further back from the street on level lots. It is a two-story wood frame structure with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof cornice is decorated with modillions, and the centered front entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and sheltered by a gabled Colonial Revival portico. The interior of the house is a modified Georgian center hall plan, with large central halls that acted as entertainment spaces when the building was used as a tavern, and were altered to accommodate domestic uses upon conversion to a residence. with Silas Hathaway was a wealthy English immigrant who came to the St. Albans area in 1788. He purchased a farm on North Main Street in 1789, and built this tavern in 1793. It has a hand-hewn timber frame, with sawn wood that was shipped via Lake Champlain from a sawmill in Whitehall, New York. He eventually moved to Swanton, where he owned several mills, suffered financial reverses, and died penniless in 1831. Between 1797 and 1801 the tavern was the meeting place for the county court of Franklin County, and it also served for a time as the post office. It was purchased in 1800 by Asa Fuller, who continued to operate the tavern until 1805, when he sold the building to Doctor Julius Hathaway. Hathaway undertook conversion of the building to a residence, and it remained in the hands of his descendants until 1931.

Its sandstone cliffs are home to the endangered Lear's macaw. Location The Serra Branca / Raso da Catarina Environmental Protection Area is in the municipality of Jeremoabo in the northeast of Bahia. It has an area of within the large Raso da Catarina region. It is bounded to the south by the Vaza-Barris River and to the north by the federally-administered Raso da Catarina Ecological Station. Environment The climate is semi-arid, the driest region of Bahia. Average temperatures are . Average annual rainfall is about , falling unpredictably during a few days in the winter. Although there is a shortage of surface water, which is found only in the valleys of the São Francisco and Vaza-Barris rivers, there may be large underground reserves. The whole area is covered by caatinga vegetation, consisting of cacti, palm trees, bromeliads and other xerophytic plants. Common species include the umbuzeiro, angico, aroeira, faveleira, catingueira and pau-de-rato. It is home to the Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari), an endangered species that uses the sandstone cliffs of the Serra Branca as a breeding area. The macaws traditionally nest in two areas, the Toca Velha owned by the Fundação Biodiversitas in Canudos and the privately owned Fazenda Serra Branca in the APA. The main food of this bird is the nut of the Syagrus coronata (licuri palm), which grows in the APA. History The Serra Branca / Raso da Catarina Environmental Protection Area was created by state decree 7.792 of 5 June 2001. To protect the Lear's Macaw the APA formed an ecological corridor in the caatinga biome with the Raso da Catarina Ecological Reserve, which became the Raso da Catarina Ecological Station in 2001. The APA became part of the Caatinga Ecological Corridor, created in May 2006.

The complex includes a 19th-century house, former tavern, and barn, all built by members of the McNeil family, the first operators of the Charlotte-Essex Ferry, whose eastern terminus is just south of the property. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The McNeil property occupies the southwestern part of Wings Point, a westward projection into Lake Champlain that forms the northern boundary of McNeil's Cove, the bay from which the ferry service between Charlotte and Essex, New York runs. Oriented facing south toward the cove are a c. 1800 Federal period wood-frame house and an 1830 Greek Revival tavern, now used as a residence. To the north of the house stands a barn with an estimated construction date of 1850. with John McNeil settled this area in 1787, moving here from Tinmouth, where he had lost property during the American Revolutionary War due to his supposed Loyalist sympathies. He quickly became a prominent local citizen, serving in town offices and the state legislature. He inaugurated the ferry service in 1790; it was the first cross-lake service, and continues to serve as a vital transportation link despite improvements in other transportation options. It was a highly lucrative operation in the first half of the 19th century, and McNeil's son built the tavern in 1830 to serve the passenger trade. Freight business declined on the route due to expanding railroad networks, and the McNeils returned to farming as a primary activity.

The set is classified as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1978.  History  The oil paintings, depicting selected scenes from the Passion of Jesus, are dated approximately from 1485 or 1488 (note: the given ISBN, 377-0-0019-7806-2 seems incorrect) or around 1490. The artist is generally thought to be one Heinrich Lützelmann (or Henri Lutzelmann in French), active in Strasbourg during these times. According to some scholars, he may be identical with the Anonymous master \\"Master of the Drapery Studies\\" (), whose attributed work is recorded in the Alsatian capital during that period. The Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame owns a few slightly earlier paintings by that artist, known in French as Maître des études de draperies. The Strasbourg Passion of Christ was originally painted for the new Magdalene Church, which was completed in 1478. That church was almost entirely destroyed by a fire in 1904. The Passion paintings, however, had been sold by the Magdalene parish to the Saint Peter's parish at some point in the 19th century after the opening of the Neo-Gothic extension and were thus preserved. Most of the ten paintings feature donor portraits complete with coats of arms, on a much smaller scale than the main depicted event. The paintings depict the episodes immediately preceding and following the Crucifixion of Jesus but not actually Jesus hanging from the Cross. In the church, this is represented by an 18th-century crucifix hung above the centre of the set. The dimensions of the nine first paintings of the set are high and wide. The tenth painting, the Descent from the Cross (or Lamentation of Christ) is approximately wide and may not originally have belonged to the same set.

Early life  Hambidge was educated in Cambridge, MA at the Lee School For Girls. She moved to New York, NY in the 1920s to pursue her acting aspirations where she met illustrator and art theorist Jay Hambidge. During a visit to Greece in 1920-1921, Mary Hambidge apprenticed as a weaver at the foot of the Acropolis and continued weaving after her return to New York. Seeking more affordable housing in the late 1920s, she moved to Rabun County in the north Georgia mountains and began meeting spinners and weavers in the area. In 1934, she moved her small weaving operations to an 800-acre property including buildings and pastures on Bettys' Creek Road, which she was later able to purchase with the help of a benefactor, Eleanor Steele Reese. Her enterprise became incorporated in 1944 as the Jay Hambidge Art Foundation.  Career  Mary Hambidge dedicated her life to the theories of \\"dynamic symmetry,\\" developed by Jay Hambidge, a design theory that links human art objects with natural laws of growth and balance. She was also greatly influenced by Greek culture and the Delphic revival of the 1920s and '30s, spearheaded by her friend and mentor, Eva Palmer-Sikelianos. In 1937, Hambidge and Eleanor Steele Reese opened a small crafts store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, Rabun Studios, that sold yardage from the Weavers of Rabun, her weaving enterprise in north Georgia that included extensive farming operations. Over the next 20 years, she would receive international honors and be invited to show her work at the Smithsonian and the Museum of Modern Art.  Legacy  In the last decade of her life, Mary Hambidge focused more on developing a community for artists and craftspeople, which led to the creation of the Hambidge Center, a renowned artist's retreat, in 1973. As one of the first artist communities in the U.S., the Hambidge Center has a distinguished history of supporting individual artists in a residency program. The Center also continues to act as a steward of its extraordinary location in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. In 2017, a 30-minute documentary about Mary Hambidge's life was produced by Atlanta filmmaker Hal Jacobs.

Due to her actions in the civil rights movement, she led to the eventual desegregation and integration of African Americans in the south.  Early life and education  Pauley was born on September 11, 1905, in Wadsworth Ohio. She was born to William Freeborn and Josephine Andrews Freeborn. Pauley's only sibling was her brother William Elbridge Freeborn. In 1908 at the age of three, Pauley moved with her family to Decatur, Georgia in DeKalb County. Pauley attended Decatur High School for her primary education, following onto Agnes Scott College. Pauley graduated in 1927 with a degree of Mathematics. At that time, due to the upbringing in both the Mid-west and the South, Pauley adopted a dual identity growing up.  Activism  Pauley began to work in public service during the Great Depression. She formed a church group with other women that worked to provide food and services to the impoverished citizens of DeKalb County. Her organization raised money to provide lunches to all students in public schools in the county. Pauley continued to work to provide services for those that did not have access to basic care, setting up a medical clinic in Decatur. Pauley was a prominent voice in her community in advocating for racial integration. As president of the League of Women Voters she repealed bylaws that restricted membership to only white women. Pauley gathered support from other politicians and activists in the area, including Martin Luther King Jr. and became the executive director of the Georgia Council on Human relations in 1960 where she continued to work for further integration of schools and began to advocate for community organizations that encouraged participation and cooperation between citizens of differing races. Pauley was then appointed to the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1968 where she worked and advocated for the continued desegregation and protection of schools in Georgia and across the country. Pauley served in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare until 1973 when officially retired.  Legacy  Throughout her activism career, Pauley held many positions which resulted in her having a crucial role in the civil rights movement. These positions include: President of the DeKalb County League of Women Voters, President of the Georgia chapter of the League of Women Voters, Head of Georgia Council on Human Relations, and working as an administrator in Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The culmination of these positions resulted in Frances Freeborn Pauley cementing her legacy as an influential individual in the southern civil rights moment. In every position which she held, Pauley attempted to promote equality and actively attempted to integrate African Americans into the structure of the institution. She was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement in 2015.  Personal life  After Graduation from Agnes Scott College in 1927 with a degree in mathematics, Pauley proceeded to assist in theatrical productions throughout DeKalb County as well as Atlanta, Georgia. Whilst directing a play at St. Philip's Episcopal Church, Frances Freeborn Pauley met a landscape architect by the name of William Crooks Pauley. This encounter resulted in their eventual marriage on May 25, 1930. Frances and William Pauley remained married throughout the extent of their lives and served as the parents to two daughters, Joan Pauley Lamb, and Marylin Pauley Beittel.

A member of the Catawba Tribe in South Carolina, Harris was a recipient of the National Heritage Fellowship for her work. Although ranging centuries, the earliest records of the Catawba pottery tradition that have been obtained date back to 1702. It was this rich history that Harris was responsible for preserving, including during a time period that ranged from the 1930s to the 1960s, when the tradition suffered due to demand. Beginning when she was 9 years old Harris took a keen interest in pottery, learning from both her mother and grandmother. As time passed, Harris found herself especially captivated by the pipe-making tradition, later passing down the art to many apprentices. Harris's legacy in Catawba pottery continues past her death.  Early life  Georgia Harris was born on July 29, 1905, in Lancaster County; a Catawba reservation near Rock Hill, South Carolina. Harris’s grandparents were both talented in craftwork. Her grandmother Martha Jane was known as one of the best Catawba potters of the nineteenth century, while her grandfather, Epp Harris, was an extraordinary pipe maker. Georgia Harris grew up watching her talented family members work at their craft and began to hone her skills based on what she witnessed. At the age of nine Harris formally began learning pottery techniques from her mother. Harris began by experimenting with clay by using the coil method, which entails rolling clay into long coils and then shaping the coils into a larger structure. Just as Catawba potters before her had done, Harris would then fire her pottery in a wood-burning open-pit fire. Despite its labor- intensive nature, Harris continued to use this technique for the rest of her life.  Career  Throughout her career Harris strove to preserve traditional Catawba pottery practices. Rather than succumbing to the temptation of more tourist-friendly forms of creating her work, Harris ensured that she followed the instruction that she learned as a child. She was known for creating a variety of pottery, ranging from the ceremonial wedding jug to smoking pipes. Harris would gather clay from the riverbanks in South Carolina, craft it by hand, and then bake the pottery in a fire pit. Towards the end of her life, Harris began teaching the next generation of Catawba potters the traditional methods that she had used. By effectively instilling the importance of the ancient techniques into her understudies, as her ancestors had done for her, Harris ensured that traditional Catawba pottery would not go extinct after her death.  Legacy  The Catawba Indian community has specialized in hand-built pottery for over four millennia, with one Catawba jar having been permanently placed in the White House Library. Over time this tradition has evolved to meet the needs of the Catawba community, therefore rendering it as a type of visual history of the nation's economic and social experiences. With the onset of The Great Depression, Catawba pottery suffered greatly due to the demand of cheaper, tourist-friendly goods. While this trend continued into the 1960s, Harris refused to compromise the level of her work, and eventually helped to usher in the revival of Catawba pottery that took place in the 1970s. By using a squeeze mold, Harris was specifically responsible for the resurgence of the pipe-making tradition within Catawba pottery. This also allowed her to introduce new shapes into the tradition, therefore allowing her to create new versions of classic pieces such as the snake pot, long-necked pitcher and wedding jug. For her entire life she lived in the Catawba community in South Carolina, perfecting her art and training future artisans as well. Harris continued her work even as she approached the age of 90 and persisted in her creation of new and innovative techniques which served to ensure the future of the tradition. She was a recipient of a 1997 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States. Georgia Harris passed away in Dallas, Georgia on January 30, 1997.

Later, she moved to Lottsburg, Virginia, to open the Holley School for freed slaves. She was an innovative and responsible teacher who devoted her life in educating and delivering ideas of freedom to black children from labor families.  Early life  Putnam was born in 1826 in Massachusetts to a Unitarian physician, who died while Caroline was a small child, and his wife Eliza (Carpenter) Putnam. Of her father's first name, her middle name, or the town of her birth, nothing is known. Eliza Putnam's second marriage to Levi Peet moved the family to southwestern New York.  Education  Putnam enrolled at Oberlin College in 1848, where she met Sallie Holley. Like Holley, who was to become her lifelong companion, Putnam was out of step with Oberlin on evangelical doctrine, eventually embracing Unitarianism. Also at odds with the college's conservative evangelical abolitionism, she followed Holley into the more radical Garrisonian wing of the abolitionist movement. Both women spent their lives in greater female activism and more radical social reform than were endorsed by Oberlin faculty. When Holley graduated in 1851, Putnam left Oberlin without completing her studies. For the next decade she worked for the abolition of slavery, largely in the shadow of Holley, who became a noted abolitionist lecturer. Putnam traveled with Holley, wrote to newspapers about Holley's speaking engagements, and called door-to-door in villages across the North to explain the tenets of Garrisonianism, though she disliked the rootlessness of constant travel and felt that she lacked the tenacity and emotional resilience required by the work.  Career  In the early 1860s, Putnam and her lifelong companion Holley shifted their attention from abolition to aid for the freed slaves. In 1868, Putnam stepped from Holley's shadow, establishing new careers for both of them. Putnam moved to Lottsburg, Virginia, to open a school for freed slaves. She taught, looked after administrative tasks, pioneered innovative means of gaining financial support, and earned southern white acceptance without yielding on racial issues. Holley taught alongside Putnam after 1870 but was never reconciled to the isolation of rural Virginia, so she spent months at a time traveling in the North. Putnam was an innovative, attentive teacher who adapted well to the conditions of southern rural black life. She held classes year-round in order to accommodate the labor demands on black children of different ages; she did not impose strict punctuality on a community without clocks; she and her assistants integrated a wide variety of print sources, objects, and the surrounding fields into the classroom. She remained at her post for forty-five years, teaching the children and grandchildren of the freedmen she had taught when she first ventured into the South. Though she retired in 1903, she remained at the school until her death in Lottsburg, Virginia. Holley had died in 1893. Putnam maintained her larger reform and abolition commitments throughout her decades in the South. She was a strident activist in the struggle to assure the freedmen access to the ballot box in the 1870s, and she served as their advocate and adviser throughout the rise of the Jim Crow laws. She was uncompromising in her demand for racial equality during a time when most Americans turned their backs on African Americans. After Putnam's retirement she encouraged the emergence of the NAACP and also worked for temperance, world peace, and the protection of animals.  The Holley School  In November 1868, Putnam became more directly involved with the freedmen, moving to Lottsburg, Virginia, to establish a freedmen’s school. Though named for Sallie Holley, the school was Caroline Putnam’s. She devised the curriculum, made innovations in pedagogy and policy, raised funds from northern friends, and taught in the school year-around. Holley joined her in 1870, but taught only intermittently. The Holley Graded School was notable for emphasizing a political curriculum and stressed the historical struggle for African-Americans and criticized industrial education unmercifully. As a prolific correspondent, Putnam never wrote for publication.  Retired life  Putnam retired in 1903, after thirty-five years of schoolwork, but she remained in Lottsburg, superintending the school and assisting in the community until her death in 1917. Among the northern white women who assisted in establishing southern African-American education in the 1860s, only Laura M. Towne taught longer; none remained longer in the South. Putnam is interred in Lottsburg, near the school founded.

History Formerly a monastic church known as San Benedetto da Norcia (Benedict of Nursia), the structure was consigned to the confraternity of the Sacro Cuore di Gesù in 1835; they enlarged and restored the church under the designs of the architect Luigi Fontana. The church was finally reconsecrated in 1880. The church was restored and reopened to cult in 2006. The cult of the Holy Heart of Jesus was founded in the 18th century, inspired by the visions of St Maria Margherita Alacoque. In 1729, a confraternity was founded in Rome, aimed at works of piety. Domenico Spinucci (1777-1796), bishop of Tolentino, was intent on creating an altar for the veneration of the Sacro Cuore in every church of his diocese. In 1805, a confraternity, also known as the dei Sacconi, dedicated to this devotion was established in Tolentino. They instituted a ritual procession every Holy Friday, starting in the church of San Vito, similar to those held by medieval flagellants, dressed in sackcloth with hoods for anonymity. The confraternity was suppressed during 1808-1815.Missale Romanum, story of the confraternity. The façade is made of brick with late-Baroque decoration. The interiors were frescoed by Fontana, who also painted the main altarpiece depicting The Apparition of the Holy Heart to Santa Maria Alacoque.

The ultimate origin of the movement is unknown; though British agents suggested the chapatis might contain secret notes, inspections revealed no such messages. The movement first came into attention in February 1857. Reports began pouring from villages of North India that thousands of chapatis were passing from one hand to another. The usual distribution procedure involved a person who would come from the jungle, give the village watchman several chapatis and tell him to make more chapatis, and distribute those to watchmen in the nearby villages. The watchman would then travel with chapatis in his turban, often with little to no knowledge of the chapatis' original source. Indians generally believed this was the work of the British, who themselves were clueless. The Friend of India, an English newspaper published in Srirampur, reported in its 5 March 1857 edition that British officers were left confused and equally scared when chapatis arrived in every police station in the area. The chapatis had travelled far; from Farrukhabad to Gurgaon, from Avadh via Rohilkhand to Delhi. The speed of distribution was particularly disconcerting to the British because it was much swifter than British mail, and several inquiries were made as to the source and meaning of the movement. They yielded the information that the breads were being distributed far more widely than anyone in Agra had yet realized, and that the Indians who received them generally took them as some sort of a sign. Beyond that, however, opinions remained divided. There were reports that lotus flowers and goat flesh were also occasionally distributed with the chapatis.

Bolden began working as a domestic worker at the age of nine. She would eventually utilize her past experiences to form the Domestic Worker's Union in Atlanta, Georgia. Through the Domestic Worker's Union, thousands of women have secured better pay and working conditions throughout the United States.  Early life  Dorothy Lee Bolden was born on October 13, 1923 in Atlanta, Georgia. Bolden was born to Georgia Mae Patterson Bolden and Raymond Bolden. Both of her parents provided for their family, her mother was a housekeeper and her father was a chauffeur. Early education was difficult for Bolden due to poor eyesight. After a fall that damaged her optic nerve at the age of three, she didn’t gain her vision until the age of nine. She started working at the age of nine as a domestic worker and would continue in this work for forty-nine years. Bolden went to E. P. Johnson Elementary School and then David T. Howard High School. However, she only attended ninth grade and then had to stop because she needed to financially support herself. As a young woman, she traveled to Chicago to go to a school for dress designers, but her poor eyesight hindered her education. During World War II, Bolden also worked at Sears and the National Linen Service, where she recognized the early efforts for unionization and labor rights. Martin Luther King Jr. was an early influence in Bolden’s life, who was her neighbor at the time of the Civil Rights Movement.  Career  Bolden was a life-long domestic worker and extremely proud of her profession. She often spoke highly of this labor and was quoted in a supplement to The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution in 1983 as saying \\"A domestic worker is a counselor, a doctor, a nurse. She cares about the family she works for as she cares about her own.\\" But domestic workers \\"have never been recognized as part of the labor force.\\" Bolden became an activist well before the re-emergence of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. In the late 1940s, Bolden refused a request from her boss, a white woman, to stay late and wash the dishes. Her boss alerted local police, who responded by taking her to a county jail for a psychiatric evaluation. In an oral history interview from 1995, Bolden recalled the severity of the incident. \\"They told me I was crazy because I had talked back to a white woman, and called in some psychiatrists to prove it,\\" said Bolden. \\"A white woman’s word was gospel, and two psychiatrists actually thought I was crazy… This was the way you got locked up…This was the system.\\" With the help of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Bolden was able to build relationships with families all over Atlanta. Women were able to open up to Bolden about their experiences as domestic workers. Life for domestic workers was very challenging. During the 1960s, domestic workers endured 13 hour workdays and received as little as $3.50. However, in 1968, Bolden started discussions with other unions about beginning to organize a national union for domestic workers. The union helped improve the wages and working conditions of domestic workers in Atlanta and served as an example for other domestic workers all across the country. Bolden eventually gathered 13,000 women from ten different cities, benefiting from job referrals and organizations. The union helped to increase wages and working conditions for domestic workers. Also members were taught how to work out problems with their employers. Bolden became an icon in Atlanta due to all the help that she gave to domestic workers. The records of this union are kept at the organization's office and in the Southern Labor Archives at Georgia State University. Under her leadership, the National Domestic Worker's Union fundamentally influenced the treatment of domestic workers. Bolden was central to actions that increased Atlanta wages by 33% over two years and won workers' compensation and Social Security rights for all domestic workers. Bolden was also responsible for registering thousands of African Americans to vote. Her work improved the living conditions of many residents throughout Atlanta. Bolden's efforts gained the attention of the Nixon Administration and she was appointed to an advisory committee on social services and welfare.  Personal life  Bolden married her first husband in 1941 but that ended in divorce. Later on, she married Abram Thompson and they had six children together- Frank, Avon Butts, Dorthy Ingram, Altenmiece Knight, Abram and Anthony. To support her family, Bolden had to work in many different jobs including the Greyhound bus station, Linen Supply Company, Sears Roebuck, and Railroad Express. Although Bolden was a domestic worker, she did not accept jobs that did not involve child care. She loved working with children and seeing them develop into young adults. Bolden died in Atlanta on July 14, 2005.

In 2016 she was awarded the Prix Goncourt for her novel Chanson douce. Life Slimani's maternal grandmother Anne Dhobb (née Ruetsch, born 1921) grew up in Alsace. In 1944 she met her future husband Lakhdar Dhobb, a Moroccan colonel in the French Colonial Army, during the liberation of France. After the war she followed him back to Morocco, where they lived in Meknes. Her autobiographical novel was published in 2003; she became the first writer in the family. Her daughter - Slimani's mother - is Béatrice-Najat Dhobb-Slimani, an otolaryngologist, who married the French- educated Moroccan economist Othman Slimani. The couple had three daughters; Leïla Slimani is the middle one. Leïla was born in Rabat on 3 October 1981; she grew up in a liberal, French-speaking household and attended French schools. An important rupture in Slimani's childhood occurred in 1993 when her father was falsely implicated in a finance scandal and fired from his position as president of the CIH Bank (he was later officially exonerated.) Slimani left Morocco at the age of 17 for Paris to study political science and media studies at the Sciences Po and ESCP Europe. After her graduation she temporarily considered a career as an actress, completing an acting course and appearing in supporting roles in two films. She married her husband, a Parisian banker whom she met first in 2005, on 24 April 2008 and started to work as a journalist for the magazine Jeune Afrique in October of that year. The work required much travel. After her son was born in 2011 and she got arrested in Tunisia while reporting on the Arab Spring, she decided to quit her job at Jeune Afrique to pursue freelance work and write a novel instead. The novel, however, was rejected by publishers. In 2013 Slimani took a writing workshop by Jean-Marie Laclavetine, a novelist and editor at Gallimard. He took an interest in Slimani's writing and helped her improve her style; in 2014 Slimani published her first novel Dans le jardin de l’ogre (\\"In the Garden of the Ogre\\") with Gallimard. The novel fared well with French critics and received the La Mamounia literary award in Morocco. Two years later she followed up with the psychological thriller Chanson douce, which won the Prix Goncourt and turned her into a literary star in France, and made her known to international audiences as well. In 2017 her second child, a daughter, was born. In addition to her native Moroccan citizenship, Slimani also holds French citizenship due to her Alsatian heritage.

The novel starts off with the immediate aftermath of the murder, and then recounts the backstory of the parents, a liberal, upper middle class Parisian couple, as well as their nanny, who is economically and psychologically struggling. Slimani named the nanny Louise after Louise Woodward, a British au pair in the US who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter of the toddler in her care. The novel was well received by French critics. It quickly turned into a bestseller, with over 76,000 copies printed within three months even before the book was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 2016. It subsequently became the most read book in France that year with over 450,000 copies printed; by the end of 2017 around 600,000 copies had been sold in France.

Elected to the Charlotte City Council in 1965, he was the first African American to serve on it since the 1890s. He was repeatedly re- elected, serving until 1974. That year he was elected to the State Senate, serving into 1980. He was also active in local business, community and civil rights organizations, establishing a reputation as a moderate. The state of North Carolina had passed measures at the turn of the 20th century to raise barriers to voter registration, and excluded African Americans for decades from the political system. Restrictions had begun to ease in cities such as Charlotte even before national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. Early life and education Alexander was born in Charlotte, North Carolina and was the son of Zechariah Alexander and his wife. His father was a prominent African-American businessman and district manager of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and owner of the Alexander Funeral Home. Frederick's brother Kelly Alexander eventually became a national leader for the NAACP. Alexander graduated from Charlotte's Second Ward High School in 1926. He attended college at Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, a historically black college. Upon his graduation in 1931, Alexander returned to Charlotte to work at his father's funeral home. Political career In addition to working with his father in the family business, Alexander began to get active politically. First he worked to organize voter registration drives among Charlotte's African-American population. The state had passed a new constitution in 1900 that raised barriers to voter registration in order to disenfranchise blacks, whether educated or not. By Alexander's time, some cities such as Charlotte had eased their subjective administration of voter registration, and approved some educated African Americans as voters. During the Great Depression, when some opportunities opened for African Americans, Alexander worked to gain hiring of black city police officers and US mail carriers. He stressed education, advocating business courses in black high schools (the public school system was segregated), and better health care in the community. While the police and postal positions were nominally part of the civil service of the city and federal government, Charlotte had managed to restrict them to whites. The first black policemen were not hired until 1941, when two were selected. They were put in a special category, not covered by the civil service nor allowed to bear arms. By 1948 six additional black officers had been hired, as the Veteran Welfare Association of Charlotte, made up of World War II veterans, had pressed for change; all were treated as regular civil service officers.Donovan X. Ramsey, \\"Before Keith Scott, a Long History of Racist Policing In Charlotte\\", Complex, September 2016; accessed 02 June 2018 In 1948 Alexander was a founding member and served as executive secretary for the Citizens Committee for Political Action in Charlotte. That year it sponsored two African-American candidates for the school board and city council. But in 1932 the city council had changed its method of election for those positions from single-member districts to at-large voting, after a black man was nearly elected to the City Council from a majority-black district. This required each candidate to gain support from a majority of voters. As the city was two-thirds white, most black political candidates were unable to gain enough votes for victory. But Alexander continued his civil rights work, gaining a reputation as a moderate leader. He was a charter member of the Charlotte Mecklenburg Council on Human Relations, was elected to the Southern Regional Council, and served on the United Community Services committee. At the same time, Charlotte was changing. In 1957 the school board decided to proceed with accepting some black students to formerly all-white schools, following the ruling of the US Supreme Court in 1954 that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. Three students persisted despite hostility and hostile demonstrations but leaders of the business community were very distressed about the negative picture portrayed about the city of Charlotte. In 1962, Alexander, representing his family business, became the first African-American member of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. He was appointed to the Mecklenburg County Board of Public Welfare one year later. To take a leadership role, in May 1963 the Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution for businesses to integrate, and voluntary integration was undertaken in the city and Mecklenburg County. Business leaders had decided it was time to make Charlotte a progressive city on racial issues, in order to promote good business. In 1964 Alexander was selected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Mecklenberg County Democratic Party. After passage of the Civil Rights Act that year and the Voting Rights Act the following year, he helped organize voter registration again and other initiatives. In 1965 he ran for and won a seat on the Charlotte City Council, becoming the first African American to serve on the Council since the 1890s. At the time, one-third of the city's population was African American. Dr. Dan L. Morrill, \\"The Civil Rights Revolution In Mecklenburg County\\", from A History Of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, posted online; Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission; accessed 02 June 2018 As a candidate, Alexander stressed \\"his desire not to be considered ‘the Negro candidate,’ but rather as a man who will work for the good of the entire community,” as quoted in The Charlotte Observer. Alexander served for nine years on the council, helping pass several anti-discrimination ordinances. He achieved removal of the fence that separated areas of the segregated Elmwood-Pinewood cemetery, and other improvements to the city cemetery. Built in the 1930s, the city cemeteries had a partition dividing them, which remained even after the city initiated voluntary integration of businesses before passage of the Civil Rights Act. Alexander's initial proposal to City Council to remove the fence resulted in their deciding to have a vote on the issue. In July 1968, the initial vote failed to pass. It was approved on January 6, 1969, when one councilman was absent and Mayor Stan Brookshire cast the decided vote in favor of the proposal. The following day, Alexander oversaw removal of the fence, remarking that when he was elected, \\"the Negro cemetery had no paved streets, was weedgrown and filled with trash... unprotected by fences on the outside.\\" Along with ground maintenance and erection of a perimeter fence, Alexander was instrumental in having Pinewood's streets paved and closing the cemetery's Ninth Street entrance, in order to allow African Americans to enter through the main gate like all other patrons. One historian regarded the removal of the fence as a pivotal moment for Alexander, when he asserted himself as a councilman. His efforts had \\"initiated a symbolic gesture that said not only to black Charlotteans, but whites as well, that the barriers of segregation belong to a bygone era.\\" Some residents had sent letters or otherwise complained of the proposal, citing fears that African Americans would steal funerary decorations from white graves, whites would be subject to assault in an open cemetery, or white ancestors buried there would object.Fred D. Alexander Papers, Special Collections at J. Murrey Atkins Library, University of North Carolina at Charlotte. But the fence was removed and the cemeteries were united. Alexander also gained city council approval to construct a fire station for northwest Charlotte, a majority-African American neighborhood that had been underserved. He gained support to preserve the Thompson Orphanage Chapel. Alexander worked to increase African-American representation in the city by appointments to various committees and governmental boards. On November 22, 1965, the homes of four black leaders in Charlotte were bombed in a terrorist attack: Alexander, his brother Kelly Alexander, Julius Chambers, and Reginald Hawkins, were all targeted, apparently to discourage their civil rights activities. No one was killed by the blasts. The terrorists were never caught, and no group claimed the attack. Alexander was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1974 as a representative of district 22. While senator he served as vice chair of the Higher Education Committee. In 1979 he introduced legislation calling for the second week in February to be designated as Black History Week in North Carolina. He was also part of the NAACP, the North Carolina Good Neighbor Council, Governor's Committee on Law and Order, and was president of the Mint Museum of Art from 1978-1979. On April 13, 1980, Alexander died. He was buried at York Memorial Park in Charlotte.

Indeed, according to the J. Paul Getty Museum, up to 180 surviving drawings \\"have been attributed to this master, comprising one of the most extensive bodies of drawn work of any northern European artist before Albrecht Dürer.\\" Conversely, it has been suggested at least once that both the Master of the Drapery Studies and the Master of the Coburg Roundels may be two separate persons and that their body of work is attributable to a whole circle of artists.  Presumed identity and body of work  A drapery study (Cabinet des estampes et des dessins, Strasbourg) Before they were given to the Master, many of his drawings had been attributed by art historians to the likes of Dürer, Martin Schongauer or even the artist known as Matthias Grünewald, with whom he was at one point, wrongly, identified. The Master of the Drapery Studies was first called the Master of the Coburg Roundels, after two circular drawings from about 1485 kept in the print room of the Coburg Castle in Bavaria. Those works are stylistically related to many drawings and sketches representing \\"folds of clothing such as sleeves, loincloths, or even whole garments\\", from which the Master quickly drew his second notname. The name \\"Master of the Coburg Roundels\\" was first given by Ernst Buchner (1892–1962) in 1927, the name \\"Master of the Drapery Studies\\" was first given by Friedrich Winkler (1888–1965) in 1930. By general consensus (including the proponents of the theory of the \\"circle of artists\\"), the Master of the Drapery Studies/of the Coburg Roundels was active in Strasbourg, Alsace, in the years 1475–1500, or 1470–1497, or 1470–1500. According to scholars such as the German Wilfried Franzen, the Master may be identical with Heinrich Lützelmann, the author of the ten panels of The Passion of Christ, a commission of the St. Magdalene Church in Strasbourg. Lützelmann may have been a student/disciple of Hans Hirtz, an influential painter recorded in Strasbourg from 1421 to 1463 and generally thought to be identical with the \\"Master of the Karlsruhe Passion\\". According to Franzen, the Master of the Drapery Studies is also the author of a second Passion cycle (eight panels) now kept in the Landesmuseum in Mainz. The Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame keeps at least two further paintings attributed to the Master (known in French as Maître des études de draperies or Maître des ronds de Cobourg). The Musée des Beaux-Arts of Dijon owns four panels, the J. Paul Getty Museum owns one, the National Museum in Kraków owns another one, as do the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Lyon, and the Staatliche Kunsthalle in Karlsruhe (a triptych). A large part of the drawings of the Master of the Drapery Studies are related to stained glass windows from the workshop of the Strasbourg-based master Peter Hemmel of Andlau, although it is disputed if they were made as copies after or as preparatory sketches before the fabrication of the windows. Hemmel, incidentally, also designed windows for the same St Magdalene Church (in 1480–1481) for which the Master painted The Passion of Christ (between 1485 and 1490), his largest surviving single work. Several of the drawings of the Master are kept in famous museums such as the Louvre, the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Albertina, and the Unterlinden Museum.

Pont Aberglaslyn is a bridge over the Afon Glaslyn and the surrounding hamlet, located near Beddgelert and Nantmor in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. A well-known beauty spot, according to Peter Bishop it was \\"one of the most visited sites in north Wales\\" at the end of the eighteenth century; an 1883 guidebook wrote that it \\"has occupied the artist's pencil perhaps more than any other\\". Location Pont Aberglaslyn is located near the downstream end of the Aberglaslyn Pass. While the location is rocky with the river running through rapids just upstream, it is not far above sea level. The river was tidal and navigable up to around Pont Aberglaslyn until the early nineteenth century, when the construction of the Cob seawall near Porthmadog prevented the tide from reaching it. Below the bridge is Llyn Glas (Blue Lake), a former harbour site used for loading copper mined nearby. The bridge was formerly on the border between Caernarfonshire on the west side of the river and Merionethshire on the east. It is now the meeting-place of the A498 and A4085. Bridge Engraving showing the falls upstream of Pont Aberglaslyn, once known as a salmon leap The bridge was perhaps built in the 17th century, then extensively rebuilt and widened in 1795-6. It is Grade II listed. As with many older bridges, folklore had claimed that it was constructed by the Devil or by the Romans (described as \\"highly dubious\\" by a National Trust survey); a stone with the marking \\"W M 1656\\" scratched on it was found during reconstruction, providing a terminus ante quem.

She was considered as one of the four women famous for their contributions to modern Chinese literature in the early Republic of China. Life Shi was born in Taiyuan in 1902 in Pingding County, Shanxi Province. From an early age she was exceptional. She would memorise whole books. Her father did not agree that to keep women virtuous you should keep them ignorant and he sent his daughter to school in Taiyuan. She studied in Shanxi's provincial capital until she was 18 when she graduated from the Taiyuan Women's Teaching College. Her education's costs were small as charges were not made for exceptional students.The Life of Shi Pingmei:Some Love Stories Have Tragic Endings, Zuihui Zhang, 19 March 2008, WomenOfchina, Retrieved 3 November 2016 The school had been started by Lü Bicheng. She took an interest in politics and for that reason she moved to Beijing and enrolled at the Women's Teaching College. She actually majored in physical education because there was no course that year for literature. After she left education she had a busy life. She wrote novel poetry and became a popular writer on ideas and Marxism. Her love life was tragic. She was tricked into swearing her undying love to a married man. When she met another man, Gao Junyu, she felt too damaged to accept his proposals and she demanded only friendship. He was from the same province of China and he was a founding member of China's communist party. Gao Junyu was also a devoted communist and he was married. They would meet and Gao Junyu divorced his wife. The only token of love she accepted was an ivory ring which matched one that he wore. He died when she was 23 and for the next three years she went to Taoran Pavilion where he was buried. She also had a now famous friendship with fellow writers Lu Yin and Lu Jingqing.Shi Pingmei (Shih P'ing-mei) 1902–1928 , Renditions.org, Retrieved 3 November 2016 Both of these friends had been very close to her during her life with an intimacy that is similar to heterosexual love. All three of them appear in Lu Yin's book and they act as narrators of Shi Pingmei's fictionalised story. Shi died when she was 26 and was buried next to Gao Junyu in Taoranting Park. The story was highlighted by Zhou Enlai when he was premier of a communist China. He visited their graves and highlighted that love and revolution were not incompatible. Shi died in 1928 and she came to be regarded in the Republic of China as one of the top four most talented Chinese women with Lü Bicheng, Eileen Chang and Xiao Hong. After her death her friend Lu Yin wrote a novel based on her love story named \\"Ivory Rings\\". This story has been retold in a book and a film.

Nakanishi is known for establishing Asian American Studies as a \\"viable and relevant field of scholarship.\\" He was the pioneer of Asian American studies in the United States and was influential in expanding the influence of Asian-American descent.  Early life  Nakanishi was born on August 14, 1949, to two Japanese immigrants in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. He attended a Japanese school up until the 11th grade and was \\"very involved in the Japanese-American community;\\" however due to his multicultural surroundings, he was exposed to many other ways of life. Nakanishi was a bright student and at his high school graduation he was elected boy mayor of Los Angeles. This level of academic and social achievement, permitted Nakanishi to be accepted into Yale University at the age of 16. He was a member of the most diverse class in Yale's history at the time, being one of twenty one minority students.  Collegiate life  As one of the few minority students at Yale, life proved difficult for a young Nakanishi. Even though World War II had been over for 20 years, there was still a great deal of ill will towards those of Japanese descent because of the war and, specifically, the bombings at Pearl Harbor. As a result, Nakanishi was alienated by many of his classmates. This sense of alienation came to a head when, on December 7th (the anniversary of the bombings at Pearl Harbor) of his first year, a group of students trooped into his dorm room and \\"bombed\\" him with water balloons. One student even went so far as to memorize Franklin D. Roosevelt's declaration of war speech and recited it to Nakanishi. Soon after this event, Nakanishi started Yale's Asian American Student Association and co-founded the Amerasia Journal, which is now the preeminent journal of Asian American studies. Don Nakanishi received his Bachelor's degree in Political science from Yale in 1971 and received his P.h.D in Political science from Harvard University in 1978.  Tenure battle  After teaching at UCLA for a number of years, Nakanishi applied for and was denied tenure by UCLA officials in 1987. Nakanishi believed this decision was a result of overt racial discrimination due to his extensive contributions in his field and took his case to court. Many UCLA students protested the school's decision and the ensuing legal battle also drew the attention of the media. The legal battle lasted several years and resulted in Nakanishi receiving his tenured position in 1989. Don Nakanishi was the first Asian American to be granted tenure by a highly accredited university. He set the precedent for others to follow in his footsteps.  Scholarship  Nakanishi co-founded the Amerasia Journal, and wrote more than 100 books, articles, and papers that focused on different social issues that plague society as a whole, not only minorites. Some of his scholarly works are his compilation of a National Pacific Asian American Political Almanac, in which he listed all of the Asian Americans that were involved in American politics, and his book \\"Asian American Politics: Law, Participation, and Policy,\\" which helped to advance the fields of Asian American political and educational research.

Constructed in 1929 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, it is located in Viña del Mar and is a national and municipal historic monument. History Constructed in 1929 during the presidency of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, the Palace of Cerro Castillo was designed by Luis Browne and Manuel Valenzuela in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The project engineer was Fortunato Castro. The palace was built on a hill whose land was attached to the nearby Callao Military Fort and occupancy of the new building began in 1930. Prior to its construction, the nearby Ex Intendencia served as the Chilean president's country and summer residence. An aerial view of the Palace of Cerro Castillo, taken in 2014, showing its proximity to nearby Viña del Mar. Traditionally, the incoming president of Chile spends the night before his or her inauguration in the palace and then returns to it afterwards to sit for a photo portrait with the newly installed cabinet. Though Cerro Castillo was rarely used by dictator Augusto Pinochet, it did serve as the site of the wedding of Pinochet's son, Marco Antonio, and Soledad Olave. The Palace of Cerro Castillo was declared an historic monument by the Viña del Mar municipal council in 2000 and a national historic monument in 2005. Design The palace, which has of floor space, is constructed in three above-ground stories and a basement, which are connected by an internal elevator. It has eight bedrooms, plus other functional and living spaces.

In 2001 she was named a Georgia Woman of Achievement.  Early life  Catherine Evans Whitener was born on August 10, 1880 in Walker County, Georgia to William R. Evans and Nancy A. Nuckolls. She was the second of seven children. She stopped going to school after fifth grade, a common practice for rural Georgia girls in the late nineteenth century. At the age of 12, while on a visit to her cousin, Whitener saw a tufted quilt, and became interested in the unique style. She practiced the technique known as tufting, and mastered the craft at the young age of 15. The very first quilt she made was a gift for her brother's wedding. Her relatives took notice of her craft, and she began to sell her works to them. This became the start of a booming industry.  Career  Whitener's business soon evolved from hand sewn quilts, to machine made carpets. She operated the business from her home and hired women neighbors to help her keep up with demand. By 1900, Whitener was selling her bedspreads for $2.50. Her sales were so successful that other people began joining the industry. As the industry grew, thousands of the hand-tufted bedspreads and carpets were sold, and with the help of her family Whitener opened the Evans Manufacturing Company in 1917. Other women were inspired by Whitener's ingenuity, and soon textile companies were opening all across Georgia.  Legacy  Whitener’s tufting industry eventually expanded to include bath mats, accent rugs, and carpets. Her carpets were especially successful, and her techniques were lasting. Today, over 90 percent of carpets produced in the U.S. today are tufted using Whitener’s early techniques. She never had the chance to make millions off the industry, however, many Georgia men and women did in later days. Dalton, Georgia, prior to the Silicon Valley boom, was the city with the most millionaires per capita in the United States; all part of Whitener’s legacy. Dalton became known as the “Carpet Capital of the World,” and in the 1990s, 90 percent of the world's carpets were being produced in or around this small city.

In 2007, he was sentenced to life in prison for his part in a sex trafficking and forced labor ring.  Career  Harrison graduated from high school in Pensacola, Florida, after which he enlisted in the United States Army and saw action in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. He served as a platoon and motor sergeant, and received an honorable discharge in 1995. He then trained at the WCW Power Plant and later in 1995, debuted in World Championship Wrestling as a jobber. He appeared on WCW Monday Nitro as well as 1997's Starrcade. After WCW folded and was purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment in 2001, Harrison's contract was not picked up, and he subsequently retired from professional wrestling. In 2000, he was a party to a multi-plaintiff lawsuit filed by Sonny Onoo, Bobby Walker and several other former WCW talents against former parent company AOL Time Warner alleging racial discrimination; the suit was settled out of court for which Harrison received a sizeable payout. In 2000, Harrison also appeared in Toughman competitions which broadcast from 1999-2001 on FX show Toughman. In 2000, he was the show's heavyweight champion.  Later life  In 2007, Harrison was convicted on charges related to keeping eight women as sex slaves in two homes he owned in Cartersville, Georgia. During proceedings, for which he served as his own attorney, Harrison contended the women lived in his homes with his wife and child because they wanted to train as professional wrestlers, and that he had helped them quit drugs. Witnesses contended that Harrison played mind games, forced them to have sex with him, and required the women to participate in large sex orgies where they engaged in sexual activity with up to eight men at a single party. The victims contended that Harrison's rigid training regimen, consisting of a wide variety of exercises and household chores, and having to memorize a series of \\"commandments\\" was designed to make them attractive prostitutes, and that he pimped them out to nightclubs, trailer parks and parties until a few of the women went to the police. Failure to complete chores or breaking rules required the women to pay money to Harrison, creating a neverending debt cycle. Upon conviction, Harrison was sentenced to life in prison.

They are generally marked as evidence of passing the tests, either individually or as part of a batch (some tests are destructive), and certified as meeting the standard of manufacture by the authorised testing agency, making them legal for import and sale. When a cylinder is manufactured, its specification, including manufacturer, working pressure, test pressure, date of manufacture, capacity and weight are stamped on the cylinder. Most countries require diving cylinders to be checked on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may be very different from the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment in which they are used. After a cylinder passes the test, the test date, (or the test expiry date in some countries such as Germany), is punched into the shoulder of the cylinder for easy verification at fill time. This is a European requirement. The international standard for the stamp format is ISO 13769, Gas cylinders - Stamp marking. A hydrostatic test involves pressurising the cylinder to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 of the working pressure) and measuring its volume before and after the test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must be permanently removed from service. An inspection may include external and internal inspection for damage, corrosion, and correct colour and markings. The failure criteria vary according to the published standards of the relevant authority, but may include inspection for bulges, overheating, dents, gouges, electrical arc scars, pitting, line corrosion, general corrosion, cracks, thread damage, defacing of permanent markings, and colour coding. Gas filling operators may be required to check the cylinder markings and perform an external visual inspection before filling the cylinder and may refuse to fill non-standard or out-of-test cylinders. This is a European requirement, a requirement of the US DOT, and a South African requirement. Quality assurance during manufacture Standard seamless high pressure aluminium cylinders do not have a limited life.They may be used until they fail test or inspection. Three cylinders from each batch are pulsation hydrostatically tested for 10,000 cycles from 0 to test pressure at 12 cycles per minute. An alternative test approved by the US Department of Transport is 100,000 cycles from 0 to working pressure. For the batch to pass, there must be no leaks or failures. Bursting pressure when new is about 2.5 times working pressure. Intervals between inspections and tests A cylinder is due to be inspected and tested at the first time it is to be filled after the expiry of the interval as specified by the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations, or as specified by national or international standards applicable in the region of use. *In the United States, an annual visual inspection is not required by the USA DOT, though they do require a hydrostatic test every five years. The visual inspection requirement is a diving industry standard based on observations made during a review by the National Underwater Accident Data Center. *In European Union countries a visual inspection is required every 2.5 years, and a hydrostatic test every five years. *In Norway a hydrostatic test (including a visual inspection) is required 3 years after production date, then every 2 years. *In Australia the applicable Australian Standards require that cylinders are hydrostatically tested every twelve months. *In South Africa a hydrostatic test is required every 4 years, and visual inspection every year. Eddy current testing of neck threads must be done according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Procedures for periodic inspections and tests If a cylinder passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains doubtful, further tests can be applied to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure. Identification of cylinder and preparation for testing Before starting work the cylinder must be identified from the labelling and permanent stamp markings , and the ownership and contents verified. Depressurisation and removal of cylinder valve Blowdown silencer for emptying scuba cylinders Before internal inspection the valve must be removed after depressurising and verifying that the valve is open. Cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of the fire hazard. If the valve is blocked or stuck closed it may be necessary to release the pressure by removing the burst disc or drilling into the valve body below the valve seat. These operations require care to avoid injury. External visual inspection Before inspection the cylinder must be clean and free of loose coatings, corrosion products and other materials which may obscure the surface. Foreign materials may be removed by brushing, controlled shot-blasting, water-jet cleaning chemical cleaning or other non-destructive methods. The method used must not remove a significant amount of cylinder material, and steel cylinders may not be heated above 300°C. Aluminium cylinders are even more restricted in the temperatures permitted, which are specified by the manufacturer. The cylinder is inspected for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations and excessive wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, and corrosion damage. The cylinder is also checked for illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. If the cylinder exceeds the rejection criteria for these items it is unsuitable for further service and will be made permanently unserviceable. Typical rejection criteria include: *Bulges *Burns *Cracks *Cuts *Dents *Defaced stamp markings *Gouges *Corrosion **General corrosion **Line corrosion **Pit corrosion (details to be added) Internal visual inspection Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods , the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination to identify any damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should be cleaned by approved method which does not remove a significant amount of wall material. Methods allowed include shot-blasting, water jet cleaning, flailing , steam or hot water jet, rumbling and chemical cleaning . The cylinder must be internally inspected after cleaning. Typical rejection criteria include: *Cracks *Corrosion **General corrosion **Line corrosion **Pit corrosion *Damage to neck threads (details to be added) Supplementary tests When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion. Hardness tests on aluminium cylinders are done on the cylindrical body and must avoid making deep impressions. Cylinder neck inspection While the valve is off, the threads of cylinder and valve must be checked to identify the thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Tap marksMachining marks left by the thread cutter, particularly on taper threads, but also possible on parallel threads. are acceptable and should not be confused with cracks. Other neck surfaces will also be examined to be sure they are free from cracks. In some cases threads may be re-tapped, but if the threads are altered they must be checked with the appropriate thread gauges. The aluminium alloys used for diving cylinders are 6061 and 6351. 6351 alloy is subject to sustained load cracking and cylinders manufactured of this alloy should be periodically eddy current tested according to national legislation and manufacturer's recommendations. 6351 alloy has been superseded for new manufacture, but many old cylinders are still in service, and are still legal and considered safe if they pass the periodic hydrostatic, visual and eddy current tests required by regulation and as specified by the manufacturer. The number of cylinders that have failed catastrophically is in the order of 50 out of some 50 million manufactured. A larger number have failed the eddy current test and visual inspection of neck threads, or have leaked and been removed from service without harm to anyone. Pressure test or ultrasonic examination Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. The results of a correctly performed pressure test are final. Inspection of valve Valves that are to be reused must be inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. The recommended practice for valve inspection and maintenance includes inspection, and where applicable correction of threads, cleaning of components, replacement of excessively worn and damaged parts, packing and safety devices, lubrication as applicable with approved lubricants for the gas service, checks for correct operation and sealing at intended operating pressure. Checks may be done with the valve fitted to the cylinder after inspection and testing, or before the valve is fitted. Gauging of threads may be mandatory to ensure the integrity of parallel threads. If the gauge exceeds the maximum gauge limit for taper threads, re-tapping may be considered at the discretion of the competent person.

If the cylinder is repainted or plastic coated, the temperature must not exceed 300°C for steel cylinders, or the temperature specified by the manufacturer for aluminium cylinders. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted. Fitting of valves should follow the procedures specified in ISO 13341 Transportable gas cylinders - Fitting of valves to gas cylinders. After the tests have been satisfactorily completed, a cylinder passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking will include the registered mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: Identification of the cylinder: * name of current owner; * cylinder serial number; * mass of cylinder; * name of the cylinder manufacturer; * manufacturer's serial number; * cylinder design specification; * cylinder water capacity or size; * date of test during manufacture. Records of the tests and inspections: * type of inspections and tests done; * test pressure; * date of the test; * whether the cylinder passed or failed the inspections and tests (giving reasons for failure); * identification stamp mark of the test station; * identification of tester; * details of any repairs made. Rejection and rendering cylinder unserviceable If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable by crushing, burning a hole in the shoulder, irregular cutting of the neck or cylinder or bursting using a safe method. If the owner does not give permission they become legally responsible for any consequences.

A model with a 900 cm³ engine supplied with Italian. In 1994 Fiat 126 was modified. Some UNO components also used in Cinquecento were used in the model, which was jokingly called production unification among the crew. For example, the doors were unified using the same side mirrors. In December 1996, the Fiat 126 ELX appeared with the module used in Cinquecento, it signaled the toxicity of exhaust gases after exceeding a certain speed by means of the color of LEDs. However, there was no expensive Lambda probe in the exhaust system, used only temporarily to actuate and program the module. Apart from modernizing the existing products, new ones were introduced. In 1994, in Bielsko-Biała, the CKD assembly of the Uno model began, which was soon replaced by a full technological cycle with engines 1.4 dm³, 1.1 dm³ and 1.0 dm³. Innocenti cars with only 1.0 dm³ engine were also installed. This model was supplied to the Innocenti network as Innocenti Mille (1000) to assist with pre-payment order fulfillment in the Brazilian market. Innocenti was a licensed UNO model purchased by Brazil. In 1995, the assembly of the Fiat Punto and Ducato SKDs in Tychy began, which lasted until the beginning of 2000 (from November 1999 it was the Punto II). In June 1997, serial production of the Siena model from Brazil started at the Body Works in Bielsko-Biała, and a few months later Fiat Palio and Palio Weekend (spring 1998). In 1998, the assembly of SKD models of Bravo, Brava, Marea, Marea Weekend and Ducato began in Tychy. It lasted in the beginning of 2000. In this place, the factory in Tychy later produced the assembly lines for Models Palio, UNO and Palio Weekend transferred from Bielsko-Biała. In spring 1998 the Cinquecento was replaced by the Seicento model. Until then, 1,164,478, the so-called \\"CC\\", of which 863,254 were exported. On September 22, 2000, the production of the Fiat 126 was completed in Bielsko-Biała, the last one was over 1000 units with the sticker \\"Maluch Happy End\\". In the period from May to October 2000, the production of the Uno, Siena and Palio Weekend models was moved to Tychy. Thus, the plants in Bielsko-Biała have ceased production of cars, focusing on the production of components (engines, gearboxes). Production of Siena was discontinued in fall 2001, Uno in October 2002, and Palio Weekend in May 2004. The cessation of car production in Bielsko-Biała resulted in the development of the production of car components, engines and gearboxes there. Over time, the Fiat-GM Powertrain company was established to manufacture a modern 1.3 dm³ \\"MultiJet\\" diesel engine. Annually, about 700,000 jobs are created. pieces intended for over a dozen passenger cars and vans from Fiat, GM and Suzuki groups. In April 2003, the factory celebrated the production of the millionth Seicento, and the entire company - the sale of the three millionth car. Production of the Panda model started in May 2003 and went on sale in September of the same year. It won the prestigious title of 2004 European Car of The Year. In June 2005, Seicento was renamed the Fiat 600. In May 2007, the production of Fiat 500 was started, which was awarded the title of 2008 European Car of The Year. The launch of its production resulted in the modernization and automation of the factory, including 384 robots in the welding shop, operated by 500 employees. On 6 September 2007, the millionth Fiat Panda was celebrated in Tychy. In the fall of 2008, production of a new version of the Ford Ka began in a joint venture. It was to be created in the number of up to 120 thousand. units per year, in the course of a few months of 2008 about 19 thousand. pieces. There were also new versions of the models produced so far. The Fiat 500 Abarth made its debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2008. It has been produced since 2008 in Tychy. In 2008, 5,905 units of this version were made, and in 2009, about 8,000. pieces. The initial production capacity of the Fiat 500 was 500 units per day, which translates to around 120,000 tonnes. pieces per year. In 2007, 65,116 units were produced. However, the enormous market interest resulted in a gradual increase in this capacity. The modernization of the plant was progressing. Since March 2008, production has increased to 750 units per day, which translates to around 180,000. pieces per year. Thanks to working on additional days (Saturdays off, shortened holiday break), 195,637 Fiat 500s were produced in 2008. In 2007, the Fiat Auto Poland plant in Tychy joined the prestigious group of \\"World Class Manufacturing\\" companies, ie those that have and use the best and most effective methods of managing the production system on a global scale. This is the result of a long process of refinement since the plant was incorporated into the Fiat Auto structure. The plant in Tychy was, among others the first of the Fiat Auto Group to implement ISO 9001 (quality management standards) and ISO 14001 (environmental management standards) since the mid-1990s. The solutions adopted in the plant in Tychy later became a model for solutions implemented in other factories of the group. A production system was also implemented in it, which contributes to the fact that cars leaving the production line have a low rate of detected production defectsIn the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, this indicator was about 6 defects per 100 cars. For example, the average index in the plants of the concern Toyota, famous for its quality, was then around 5 detected defects per 100 cars. Detected defects are removed before the cars are put on sale. and defects occurring in subsequent years of operation. At the same time, there are critical voices saying that the increase in quality and efficiency comes at the expense of the work atmosphere and the situation of employees. Cars produced by Fiat Auto Poland are exported to 68 countries, including to Japan (4,174 cars were shipped there in 2008), and these exports account for approximately 3% of the value of all transactions of this type nationwide. In the mid 2000–2009 decade, Fiat Auto Poland produced about 300-350 thousand. cars per year. In 2008, a record number of 492,885 cars were produced, including 19,046 second-generation Ford Ka, the production of which was officially launched on September 25, 2008 in Tychy. In 2009, the plant produced a total of about 606 thousand. car pieces. The Fiat 500C convertible made its debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2009. In mid-2010, the production of the Fiat 600 model ceased. The production of the next generation of Fiat Panda was moved from Tychy to the factory in Pomigliano d'Arco near Naples, in exchange for the Lancia Ypsilon model, which had been produced so far in Termini Imerese in Sicily. In mid-2011, the production of Lancia Ypsilon II began in the Tychy plant. In December 2012, the plant announced the need to lay off approximately 1,500 employees, cut production and end production of the Panda. The company's total revenues in 2012 exceeded PLN 14,150 million, sales revenues amounted to over PLN 14,100 million. The plant in Tychy in 2009 was the largest Fiat factory in Europe and the second largest in the world, after the Brazilian factory in Betim. FCA Poland cooperates in the field of projects and research with the former Center for Research and Development of Small-Size Cars - Bosmal.

(1584–1655), born in Marsh Gibbon, Buckinghamshire, was an English Puritan who settled at Lynn, Massachusetts in 1635. He was known for the founding of Southampton, New York with Edward Howell, Edmond Farrington, Edmund Needham, Abraham Pierson the Elder, Thomas Sayre, Josiah Stanborough, George Welbe, Henry Walton, Job Sayre, and Thomas Halsey in 1639/40.  Early life and immigration to New England  Edward Howell was baptized on 26 July 1584 at Marsh Gibbon, Buckinghamshire, England. He was son of Henry Howell, Gent. and Margaret Hawten (Hawtayne) and heir to Westbury Manor. Howell and his family (see below) immigrated to Boston c. 1635, where they first settled at Lynn, Massachusetts, where they were one of the four largest landowners. In 1638, he sold Westbury Manor to Richard Francis. On 14 Mar 1638/39, he took the oath as Freeman in Boston, Massachusetts where he received 500 acres at Lynn.  Founding of Southampton, Long Island, New York  Howell's Water Mill (Water Mill, Southampton, New York) During the winter of 1638/40, a new settlement was projected on Long Island, New York, of which Edward was the leader. The agreement, or term, of this new settlement, which is still in existence in the Southampton Town Clerk's Office, is believed to be in Edward's own handwriting. In 1640 the Howell family removed permanently to Southampton, Long Island, New York, first settling at \\"Old Town\\", and then in 1648, at what is now the current village of Southampton (New York). The original founders, or \\"undertakers\\" as they were then called, of Southampton were: Edward Howell; Edmund Farrington; Josias Stanborouh; George Welbe; Job Sayre; Edmund Needham; Henry Walton; Daniel How; John Cooper; Allen Bread; William Harker; Thomas Halsey; Thomas Newell; John Farrington; Richard Odell; Phiip Kyrtland; Thomas Farrington; and Thomas Terry. He took a leading role in the affairs of Southampton, serving in many capacities there an in Connecticut, of which Southampton became a part following a request made by himself and two others 25 October 1644. He served as magistrate in Southampton until 1653 and Assistant of the Connecticut Colony from 1647 to 1653. The original settlement, called \\"Mecox\\", was a name taken from the Shinnecock Indians for \\"flat or plain country.\\" Howell announced that he would build a mill for the grinding of grain, rye and wheat into flour. The colonists expected him to build a wind mill but Howell instead chose an area of land that allowed for a stream to power the mill (one which empties into the present Mecox Bay). Nearly four hundred years later, Howell's Water Mill still stands in present-day Water Mill where it was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 1983. For one hundred and fifty years, the Howells were the most extensive landowners, the largest taxpayers and held the highest offices.  Family  Edward Howell married (1st) at Odell, Bedfordshire, England Frances Paxton on 7 April 1616 (d. 1630). They had four sons and three daughters: # Henry Howell (bapt. 2 Dec 1618, bur. 29 Aug 1619) # John Howell (bapt. 24 Nov 1622) # Edward Howell (bapt. Sep 1626) # Richard Howell (bapt. 1629, d. aft. 1698) m. Elizabeth Halsey (dau. of Thomas Halsey of Hertfordshire, England & founder of Southampton, New York) # Dorothy Howell # Margaret Howell (bapt. 24 Nov 1622) m. the Rev. John Moore of Southold, Long Island # Margery Howell (bapt. 1 Jun 1628) He married (2nd) Eleanor (before 1632). # Henry Howell # Arthur Howell (bapt. 1632) # Edmund Howell  Death and legacy  Edward Howell died shortly before 6 October 1655 and was buried in the Southend Cemetery, Southampton, Long Island, New York. In 1657, his widow. Eleanor, was granted 20 shillings in compensation for her house being burned by a Native tribe. She next married before 14 March 1663 Thomas Sayre.

It provides a reservoir of water for irrigation and drinking in the arid caatinga environment of the Raso da Catarina. The reservoir covers the ruins of the city of Canudos, scene of the War of Canudos in 1896–97. Location The Cocorobó Dam is in the Raso da Catarina region of the driest part of Bahia. The dam is about from the state capital, Salvador, near the junction of highways BR-116 and BR-225. It is in the municipality of Canudos. The Vaza Barria project, which built the dam, was to irrigate , control floods, support fish farming and supply water to the town of Nova Canudos. The dam is owned by the Departamento Nacional de Obras Contras as Secas (DNOCS). The reservoir submerged the ruined city of Canudos, location of the War of Canudos (1896–97). This was apparently a deliberate effort to erase memories of the suppression of a popular revolt by the republican army in 1896–97. However, the Canudos State Park, created in 1986 to the south of the dam, preserves key sites of the war. The stated purpose of the park is to make it impossible to forget the martyrs led by Antônio Conselheiro. Reservoir The dam impounds the Vaza-Barris River.

She was best known for her contributions to the community as the founder of several charitable outlets in the area and as an activist for women's and civil rights.  Early life  Taylor received a considerable education, graduating from the Beach Institute and Atlanta University, and later attending Hampton Institute and Columbia University. She started her journalistic work as a columnist for a local Savannah newspaper, where she was not afraid to speak out against the tense racial issues of the era. After many years of segregated schooling, the education she received at Atlanta University, a less racially biased institution of the time, was instrumental in her career and set her on the course for social activism. A cousin of Stiles Taylor described the influence the university had on her:  Career  From writer to teacher to social activist, Taylor was a very ambitious and accomplished person. She was a well- known columnist for the Chicago Defender, and one of very few women journalists for that newspaper, and her writing contributions led her to be nationally recognized. She often wrote on controversial topics such as racial segregation. In those columns about racial interactions and political affairs, she often referenced other accomplished writers like Mrs. Corbett Ashby. Taylor also wrote a weekly column, \\"Activities of Women's National Organizations\\", during the war time in order to kept the readers up to date about women's organizations across the country. In addition to race relations, Taylor also spoke our for women's issues by writing in support of sound and equal marriages and the elevation of the negro woman. Beyond her writings, Taylor is lauded for her efforts to make positive social change, including education, civil rights, and public health. In 1917, she founded the Toussaint L'Ouverture Branch of the American Red Cross. Additionally, Taylor served as national leader of the National Association of Colored Women Mary McLeod Bethune's \\"chief aide.\\" Furthermore, she led the Savannah Chapter of the National Association of Colored Women's Club, which provided the means to open a nursing home, a home for girls, and two free health clinics. She joined Mary McLeod Bethune to organize the entire Southeastern Region of the club in 1919, assuming the position of corresponding secretary and president of the Association's Georgia State Federation. Taylor was passionate and active about the wellbeing of people in her community, and the nation as a whole. Earlier in her career, Taylor devoted much time to educating people in Savannah with limited opportunities. She achieved great success in these efforts. She was also the first African American woman to become Savannah's Probation Officer in Juvenile Court. Additionally, she wrote a letter to President Woodrow Wilson in reaction to a lynching. She cared deeply about reconciling racial divides and took her concerns to people of highest authority in an effort to make a change. Taylor's lifelong career of dedication to the social, mental, and physical betterment of all people has led her into national recognition.  Legacy  Taylor inspired many with her willingness to take action towards furthering her social causes during a time when it was somewhat taboo to do so. She had a radical vision of social improvement for her time, saying that the South was \\"on the threshold of a new era,\\" and she dedicated her life towards spurring that on in a vast range of outlets from high school education to club organization. Taylor was an integrationist and advocated an alliance between black women's organizations with other national women's organizations in order eliminate social tension and create a sustainable future. Drawing from her efforts, the Stiles Taylor family remains a prominent figure of charitable works to this day with many of her descendants serving as pastors, teachers, and charity group leaders in the Savannah community. To commemorate a lifetime of service and activism, Taylor was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement in 2014.

Micah Fitzerman-Blue, Noah Harpster, Matt Spicer, Max Winkler, Dan Gregor and Doug Mand serve as co-screenwriters, with an original story written by Gabe Sachs, Jeff Judah, Spicer and Winkler. It stars Adam DeVine, Jeffrey Tambor and Gillian Jacobs. The film was released on Disney+ on August 14, 2020. Plot Theo Moses is an aspiring young magician coping with the death of his father. His mother reveals his acceptance video from the Institute of Magic, a summer camp run by the eccentric Roy Preston; assuming his father applied for him, Theo agrees to attend. Andy Duckerman is a down-on-his-luck former magician with a grudge against the famous Kristina Darkwood, who has a successful solo act on the Las Vegas strip. Preston persuades Andy, his former student, to return to camp as a counselor alongside Darkwood. At camp, the students are split into four different cabins to face each other in the end- of-year Top Hat competition, where one student will win the coveted Golden Wand. Andy is assigned to lead the Hearts cabin, including Theo; allergy-prone Nathan Jenkins; rabbit-obsessed Ruth Brusselbach; Judd Kessler, the less talented son of a famous magician; and antisocial Vera Costa. Darkwood leads the Diamonds, including previous Golden Wand winner and bully Vic d'Antonio, and Janelle Santos, who takes a liking to Theo. The inexperienced Hearts struggle to learn magic, and a frustrated Andy almost quits, but discovers that Theo has a gift for card tricks. Determined to beat Darkwood, Andy helps the Hearts realize their hidden talents: Judd embraces costume design, Ruth has an affinity for birds over bunnies, Nathan can perform impressive mental calculations, and Vera begins to make friends. Helping Theo overcome his stage fright, Andy reveals that he and Darkwood met as campers, and became a couple as well as magic partners; she accepted a television deal behind his back, and her career took off while he fell into obscurity. Darkwood convinces Janelle, whose wealthy parents send her to various camps instead of spending time with her, to give magic a chance. Attempting to humiliate Nathan, Vic is outdone by Theo and seemingly burns Theo's cards – a gift from his father, who introduced him to magic. Distraught, Theo bonds with Andy and his fellow Hearts, as well as Janelle. After the Diamonds check out all the camp's props for themselves, Andy takes the Hearts into town to train with whatever they can find, and the young magicians perform their acts in public. Andy confronts Darkwood, who already reprimanded her team, and she reveals the truth behind their falling out: she tried to negotiate a deal for both of them, which he never gave her a chance to explain. She has booked him a matinee in Vegas for the next day; with Preston's encouragement, Andy accepts, knowing he will miss the Hearts' training but be back in time for the Top Hat competition that night. Preston informs the Hearts that Andy has gone to Vegas, but after his successful matinee, Andy is invited to perform the evening show – at the same time as the competition. The students' families, including Janelle's parents, arrive for the competition. Without Andy there, a nervous Theo is encouraged by Preston, who shows him the supportive video Theo's mother submitted as his application. Andy – having turned down the Vegas show – watches his team perform, and deduces that Preston arranged everything to restore Andy's love for magic. Theo conquers his fears to give the final performance, a heartfelt card trick thanking his family for their support. The Hearts win the Top Hat, and Janelle is awarded the Golden Wand. Andy is hired to be the camp's year-round talent director, and reconciles with Darkwood, who agrees to teach with him if he performs at her Vegas show on occasion. Vic apologizes to Theo and returns his unharmed cards; Judd's father proudly accepts that he is a talented designer, rather than a magician; Ruth finally holds a rabbit while forming a close friendship with Vera; and Janelle and Theo share a kiss. The film ends with a new Institute of Magic video headed by Andy.

Her training school lives on to this day and is now the School of Nursing at Virginia Commonwealth University. In addition, Cabaniss was the founder of the Charter Member and First President of the Virginia State Association of Nurses (now the Virginia Nurses Association). Finally, she was the President and original member of the Virginia State Board of Examiners of Nurse Founder of the Nurses Settlement, forerunner of the Instructive Visiting Nurses Association. Sadie Health Cabaniss was inducted into the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame on July 1, 2002 at the ANA Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Early life and education  Sadie Heath Cabaniss was born in Petersburg, Virginia on October 9, 1865, to parents Charles and Virginia Cabaniss. She graduated from St. Timothy's School (an all-girls high school in Catonsville, Maryland) in 1874. After her high school graduation, she served as a governess and a teacher before attending college. Cabaniss attended Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland.  Career  Throughout her career, Sadie Heath Cabaniss was heavily devoted to the cause of public health and laid the foundation for professional nursing in Virginia. In 1893, Cabaniss first started working as a night supervisor at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Two years later she became the supervisor of the operating room at the Old Dominion Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, which was connected to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV). While there, the faculty asked her to develop a training school for nurses. Cabaniss accepted the offer and ran the school on the Nightingale method of nursing education from 1895 until April 1901. The Nightingale method involves training in a civil hospital by way of an apprenticeship. The school exists to this day and is now known as the School of Nursing at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 1900, she and several students from the Old Dominion nursing school organized the Nurses Settlement of Richmond in response to the sick. This organization provided home services for the ill. This established the first rural visiting nursing service in Virginia in Hanover County. Cabaniss also developed Virginia Nurses Association in 1901. This organization was made up of alumni from existing training schools in Virginia. As president of the organization, she assisted in drafting a measure that ultimately regulated the practice of nursing in the Commonwealth. Her continued devotion to public health led Cabaniss to develop a nurses' settlement in St. Augustine, Florida as well.  Legacy  In 1921, after the death of Sadie Heath Cabaniss, the Graduate Nurses Association of Virginia started to raise $50,000 to honor Cabaniss. And in 1928, the Cabaniss Memorial School of Nursing Education opened at the University of Virginia. The main goal of the Cabaniss Memorial School of Nursing Education was to further prepare well-qualified nurses as supervisors, administrators and teachers. From 1928 to 1967, Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical campus named one of the building \\"Cabaniss Hall\\". The \\"Cabaniss Hall\\" was first served as the Nursing Education Building and then became the dormitory for nursing students. The Nursing Division of the Medical College of Virginia Alumni Association of the Virginia Commonwealth University (MAVAA of VCU) and the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Nursing's Cabaniss Leadership Challenge was established in July 2010 to honor the founding director of the School of Nursing, Sadie Heath Cabaniss. The main goal of this challenge was to raise $4 million for scholarships, professorships, and the chair position if the dean of the School of Nursing.

The character herself was generally well received by critics, though Nintendo's alteration of some of her more revealing outfits between the original Japanese and her Western release in North America and Europe received more of a mixed response, eliciting much discussion about censorship and differences between cultures from journalists. Character design=Conception Lin Lee is from Xenoblade Chronicles X's fictional planet of Mira, a largely undeveloped alien world that the remnants of humanity has crash landed on in efforts to escape the destruction of Earth. She is a thirteen-year-old female child prodigy in the realm of mechanics. She is a part of BLADE, a group working towards colonizing and developing humanity's new planet, specifically working as an Outfitter, the game's equivalent of an engineer for mechanical devices. She specializes in \\"Skells\\" - large humanoid mecha piloted by people housed inside them, something she is enthusiastic about to the point of reading Skell fan fiction. Despite the relatively serious setting and career choice, her character is still known for cracking jokes, specifically recurring allusions to cooking and eating team member Tatsu, an in-game creature of small stature called a \\"Nopon\\" that resembles an animal. As a throwback to the series's prior entry, Xenoblade Chronicles, developers designed her hair clips to be small replicas of the \\"Monado Sword\\", the weapon of the prior game protagonist Shulk. Lin Lee's Japanese voice actress was Mariya Ise. Localization Initial reports claimed that in the western releases of the game, it was made so that the player could not dress her in more of the revealing costumes in the game, such as bikinis, risque shirts, or very short shorts, and some sources have also claimed that Lin's default outfit was radically changed from something more revealing. While the aforementioned outfits were indeed altered for the character, Lin's default outfit remains unaltered from the Japanese version. Some reports also showed her age as being revised up to 15 years old which was dismissed as erroneous by the founder of 8-4, the company contracted to localize Xenoblade Chronicles X. Lin's English voice acting was done by Cassandra Lee Morris. She auditioned and won the role despite the only direction she was originally given was that the video game involved \\"space travel\\". Morris sought to preserve Lin's characteristics as strong female figure in her portrayal, describing her as \\"super smart and very self- reliant... She can cook dinner and also kick your ass.\\" Morris's take on the character did however include using a deeper, older sounding voice for Lin, because it was believed that Western audiences would find the high-pitched Japanese version \\"grating\\". She voiced between 1,600 and 1,800 lines of dialogue for Lin - above average for a video game. Reception Lin's overall character was generally well received by critics. Numerous journalists noted Lin as one of the few standout characters in the game that received notable character development, and praised the humor she introduced into the game, notably the jokes about cooking and eating the character Tatsu. IB Times referred to her as \\"funny, impulsive, and actually rather enjoyable to watch...She's got a lot of fun dialogue, though it's a bit hard to believe that she's 13.\\" Lin's revision in costume design and age from her original portrayal in Xenoblade X's Japanese release to her portrayal in Western releases in North America and Europe elicited much discussion from journalists in regards to censorship and differing cultural values. While her original costume was interpreted as shocking or inappropriate by Western audiences, it was seen much more as normal and mundane in Japan. Western websites had mixed reactions to the changes. Websites like IGN and VG247 decried the changes as censorship. Others were more supportive of the changes. Kyle Nofuente of Tech Times found the changes to be \\"reasonable enough to tone down Lin's sexuality to a level more appropriate for her age\\" but conceded that Nintendo's fanbase may not be as understanding, considering the negative reaction similar changes to Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water. Tatiana Morris of GameZone expressed similar sentiments, stating that, while she was initially surprised at how much of Lin's design had been changed, and would usually be against it, but ultimately felt that the combination of the revealing outfits and Lin being under 18 was enough to warrant the changes in her eyes. Siliconera also felt that her age made the changes \\"understandable\\". Tom Phillips of Eurogamer found Lin's revealing costume choices questionable regardless of her age, referring to it as an \\"eye-opening choice of outfit for an adventurer readying for battle.\\" Journalists noted that many fans had negative reactions to the changes as well, complaining they constituted unnecessary censorship. The debate even inspired a response from Cassandra Morris, Lin's English voice actress, who defended Nintendo's changes to the character, stating: > \\"People are calling it censorship. I really see it as localisation. There > are a lot of cultural differences between Japan and the US and Europe. I, > personally, don’t mind that Lin’s outfits were changed for the US version. > My hope is that players will be able to concentrate on Lin’s abilities and > what she can bring to your game and what she can do for the other members of > her party and not just how she looks. I also think that covering Lin up a > little bit will make parents more comfortable with kids playing the game, so > it also opens the game up for a wider audience.\\" Alexandria Burlacu of Tech Times agreed with the notion, theorizing that some may feel the changes made her more believable and realistic character for Western audiences.

Warren Richard Briggs was the architect for the building, as he had made other courthouses similar to this in the state. At one point the building house county courtrooms, The city of Willimantic government, the local Grand Army of the Republic group, and the Town of Windham government.  Recent history  The police station, the county courthouse, and the city library relocated in 1977. It joined the Main Street Historic District, part of the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The city hall became a town hall for Windham when Willimantic was downgraded to a CDP in 1983.

History The Norwind was the first ferry to sail on the Hull-Rotterdam route for North Sea Ferries in 1965. On 17 December 1965 North Sea ferries started their inaugural ferry service. The ferries Norwave and Norwind sailed on their inaugural sailings from Hull to Rotterdam’s Europoort. With Norwind a schedule was established that is continued to this day. P&O;’s interest was through its subsidiary General Steam Navigation Company, which had a 35 per cent stake in North Sea Ferries. With ships of 4,306 tons and 360 feet long, it wasn't the space for 249 passengers that was unusual it was the ships’ capacity for trucks, trailers, coaches and cars. In 1965 54,000 passengers were carried. Nine years later, demand was growing for North Sea ferries and two new ships, more than twice as large as before, Norland and Norstar were introduced on the Hull- Rotterdam route, therefore replacing Norwind and Norwave. Before they were sold the decision was taken to transfer them to a new route, Hull-Zeebrugge. In 1974 they appeared on this route and therefore, again, starting another important service. In 1987 after 22 years of service the new ferries Norsun and Norsea were introduced on the Hull-Rotterdam route. They replaced Norland and Norstar, moving them down to Hull-Zeebrugge. Norwind and Norwave left UK waters for the Mediterranean that year. Heavily rebuilt, Norwind was sold to Ventouris and renamed Grecia Express. She was deemed to be a total loss following sinking in 1993.

She was one of the first women to receive a degree in geology, obtaining a PhD from Rutgers University. Growing up in a military family exposed to nature and traveling at an early age, Nelson showed an eagerness for geology by devoting her days to learning the various geological processes that encompass the earth, eventually winning a prize for an excellence in geology from Vassar College. She was later hired by Milwaukee-Downer College as part of college's expanding geological and geographical sciences department eventually leaving her position in 1943 to help as a petroleum geologist as part of the war effort. Nelson went on to give many lectures that helped inspire students of all genders towards the field of geography and geology. She died in December 1982 at the age of 69 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin after a long battle with cancer.  Career and education  Katherine Greacen Nelson received her Bachelor of Science from Vassar College in 1934, being acknowledged for her excellence in geology. Four years after graduating from Vassar, Nelson attended Rutgers University and became one of the first women to earn a PhD in geology. Nelson went directly into teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, as well as being the curator at the Thomas A. Greene Memorial Museum. During World War II, Nelson left teaching and began working in petroleum geology and paleontology working for Shell Oil Co. (later transitioning to Hunt Oil Co.) as a way to help out with the war effort. At the end of WWII, she returned to Milwaukee-Downer College to continue teaching in both geology and geography. During her time teaching there she also spent time teaching at the Milwaukee-Downer Seminary and YWCA. In 1954 when the school merged with Lawrence College (under the name UW–Milwaukee), Nelson decided to once again leave Milwaukee-Downer College. In 1956 the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee obtained the Milwaukee-Downer campus. Due to her heavy involvement in both the museum and university, Nelson took the initiative to purchase the Greene Museum from Milwaukee-Downer. She created an active public education program for the less wealthy where more than 20,000 people have benefited from its teachings.Klussendorf, J., Milkulie, D. G., Paull, R. K., & Paull, R. A. (2011). Memorial: Katherine Greacen Nelson (1913-1982). Retrieved February 4, 2019, from http://archives.datapages.com/.../068/068006/pdfs/786.htm In this same year, Nelson was named the first faculty member and chair of the Department of Geological & Geophysical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.  Influence as a female geologist  As the first women to graduate with a PhD in geology from Rutgers University, Nelson made many fundamental contributions in her field. Therefore, she received numerous awards, including the Midwest Federation of Mineralogical & Geological Societies Educator of the Year Award in 1982, while working as a professor at University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. At the time of Nelson's death she was one of the first women ever nominated for the Presidency of Chapter E in the latter society.Mikulic, D. G., & Mikulic, D. G. (2016). Katherine Greacen Nelson: Advocate For The Public Awareness Of Earth Science. KATHERINE GREACEN NELSON: ADVOCATE FOR THE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF EARTH SCIENCE. doi:10.1130/abs/2016nc-275094 In addition, she was the first woman to receive the Neil Milner Award, and to acquire the position president of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, & Letters. Nelson's influences towards education are more significant compared to her research or findings as a geologist. However, they are equally as essential to geology as a whole. As a result, The Nelson Award was created to honour her contributions to education in the field of geology. She was a great advocate for making women as a whole more prevalent in the world of geology.  Community work  Nelson was invested in helping out the general population throughout the entirety of her career. She believed that everyone should gain a basic understanding of their surroundings and appreciate the wonder of geological processes. Nelson accomplished this by putting a great amount of effort and detail into presenting public lectures to inquisitive minds. This also included acting as a tour guide to students when visiting museums and offering information about the field. She became deeply entrenched in the media by writing many newspaper articles as well as giving media interviews. She was devoted to helping geology hobbyists in their range of work by offering her knowledge to everyone. She was influential in the area of preserving glaciers as she explained the importance of Wisconsin's glacial feature to politicians, which would later lead to the establishment of the National Ice Age Scientific Reserve. Throughout all of this, Nelson inspired a new generation of geological interest in students.  Public image  Nelson was a well- respected geologist who was passionate about the sciences and teaching. She is remembered for her work in advocating for earth sciences and was recently recognized by the Geological Society of America as one of the pioneers for woman in geology in the United States of America. The legacy that she left in geology is remarkable but it is her impact in the classroom that really left a mark. She is remembered as a kind, warm, and enthusiastic individual of whom students spoke highly. Nelson did not do any of her work for money, but because of her true passion for understanding and helping others understand the history of the Earth.

The operations of Coventry Corporation Transport passed to West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive in the local government reorganisation of 1974. History On 1 January 1912 Coventry Corporation took over the operations of the Coventry Electric Tramways Company which had until then ran the tramway in the city, a service which had begun in 1895. The purchase price of £220,638 included 13 miles of track, 41 double deck open-top electric tramcars and the depots on Foleshill Road and at Priestley's Bridge on Stoney Stanton Road.Coventry Transport 1884-1940 by A.S.Denton & F.P.Groves published 1985 by the Birmingham Transport Historical Group. A more comprehensive history of the city's tramway system is found at Coventry Corporation Tramways. First buses The first motor bus service began on 30 March 1914 using six locally made Maudslay vehicles. These were open top double deckers with solid tyres, no windscreen and seats for 34 passengers, and each cost £739. The route was from Stoke Heath to the Fire Station in Hales Street. During the first week of operation, £107 4s 4d was taken in fares. A further service to Hearsall Lane started in May but both were short lived as the chassis were requisitioned by the War Office in September that year. After the Great War, bus services resumed in 1919 and a bus garage at Harnall Lane was opened in 1921 adjoining the Priestley's Bridge premises. The tramway system reached its peak of 58 tramcars that same year with 6 services to Bedworth, Bell Green, Stoke, Earlsdon, the Allesley Road and the Railway Station. At the 1925 Commercial Motor Show, Maudslay exhibited one of the first covered top double deckers which the Corporation subsequently purchased. It was not until 1927 however that pneumatic tyres were first fitted to a bus. In 1931, Pool Meadow Bus Station was opened to cater for nine main routes into the city. The following year the first tram route was abandoned and plans were drawn up to gradually replace the whole system. The general manager T R Whitehead retired in 1933 and was replaced by Ronald Fearnley, a post which he held for nearly three decades. He became a pioneer in the transport industry, and worked closely with the Daimler Company in the development of an advanced lightweight all- metal bus with 60 seats yet within the maximum length and weight regulations of the time. The last remaining independently operated services in the city were purchased in 1936, and the department could then complete its coverage of the area with routes to Baginton, Burton Green and Berkswell. World War II The substantial damage caused by the air raid of 14 November 1940 finally led to the tramway system being completely abandoned. It was later reported that the 2700 tons of material salvaged from the tramway track was sufficient to make 180 heavy tanks.Diamond Jubilee of Mechanical Road Transport in Coventry 1884-1944 published in 1944 by the City Development Office. Despite considerable damage to buses and premises, on 16 November, some services were resumed operating from the outer termini to as close to the city centre as conditions permitted. Within a week regular services were almost back to normal, ensuring workers could reach the factories for vital war work. By February 1941 only 73 buses out of the total fleet of 181 were undamagedCoventry Transport 1912-1974 commemorative brochure published 1974 by the City of Coventry Public Transport Committee. and vehicles had to be hired from many other operators around the country. Overnight parking was dispersed to temporary facilities at Highfield Road football ground and the Lythalls Lane greyhound stadium. Supply of new buses was limited during the war and those that were delivered were of government controlled austere construction, the most striking feature being the wooden slat seats. After the war In 1948 restrictions on purchasing new vehicles were relaxed, and the bus fleet was quickly standardised almost entirely on locally-built Daimler double deckers with an open platform at the rear and the diesel engine at the front. The last petrol-engined bus was replaced in 1949. Many of the wartime specification buses were in poor condition and had to be re-bodied, some at the department's Keresley works. Notable exceptions to the Daimler purchasing policy were a London Transport style AEC and a Crossley which had a distinctive mainly cream colour scheme and initially had an automatic gearbox. There was also a batch of nine of the last buses built by the Maudslay company. Services which in the war had finished at 8:30 in the evening were gradually extended to 11:00 pm. 1950 was the peak year of operation; 110 million passengers were carried but the increased ownership of private cars had a progressively adverse effect on public transport. Many of these cars were produced in city factories and it also became increasingly difficult to attract sufficient bus drivers with the wages being paid by such industries. In 1954 a new garage was built at Sandy Lane with covered capacity for 150 buses, half the fleet, and the Foleshill site was closed. Odd and even numbered vehicles were then split between Sandy Lane and Harnall Lane respectively. \\"Monobus\\" era Up until 1965, all vehicles required a crew of two, a driver plus a conductor who took the fares. However, in that year, new rear-engined front-entrance double deckers were purchased and these could be operated by one man. In addition they were built to a newly permitted length of 30 feet and could thus seat a dozen more passengers. Although initially Leyland vehicles were used, the fleet subsequently again became standardised on Daimlers, using their Fleetline chassis. With these new vehicles a distinctive feature of Coventry buses since the 1930s was omitted, the twin side-by-side destination displays. Thereafter the service number and destination displays adopted numerous different layouts. To speed up the process of passengers boarding, in 1968 a batch of vehicles with separate entrance and exit doors entered service, but within a few years the standard reverted to a single-door design. Continuing difficulties in recruiting drivers led the Corporation to try another approach. Although conductresses had been employed since the First World War, it was not until 1970 that the first two women drivers completed their training. It was the department's policy that drivers should first qualify as conductors and that inspectors should have previously been drivers. Subsequently, one of these ladies did became an inspector, a unique achievement. Starting in 1970, new buses were painted in a lighter red and ivory scheme, which was intended to gradually replace the maroon and cream that had been used on previous buses. The department also operated several coaches but for some years these had sported sky blue colours. On 1 April 1974, the entire bus operation was taken over by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) and Coventry Corporation Transport ceased to exist. The fleet at that time comprised 185 front loading double deckers, 116 rear loading double deckers, two single deckers, one coach and one minibus.Coventry Transport 1940-1974 by A.S.Denton & F.P.Groves published 1987 by the Birmingham Transport Historical Group. With the city coat of arms removed from every bus, the familiar maroon and cream paint scheme also began to disappear from the city streets. As buses were due for repainting they gained the blue and cream colours of the Birmingham company. Preserved vehicles A number of former Coventry Transport vehicles have been saved from the scrapyard. EVC 244 is single deck Daimler COG5, new in 1940, with 38 seat body by Park Royal. It passed to Derby Corporation in 1949 as a driver training vehicle. Since 2009 it has undergone an extensive restoration back to its Coventry condition. EKV 966, a 1944 double deck Daimler CWA6 originally with a wartime specification body, was rebuilt after the war and then became a maintenance vehicle in 1959. It is now owned by the Transport Museum and is to be converted back to bus condition. GKV 94 is typical of the first hundred buses purchased after the war. It is a 1950 Daimler CVA6 with AEC engine and 60 seat Metro-Cammell bodywork. It was acquired for preservation in 1968 and is currently undergoing major renovation. GKV 105 from 1949 is one of the minority of single deckers purchased. It is a Daimler CVD6 with 34 seat bodywork by Brush and Daimler engine. Four Daimler CVG6 double deckers typical of the late fifties and early sixties survive. All have Metro-Cammell bodies and Gardner engines. Travel De Courcey runs VWK 239, new in 1958 which has 60 seat bodywork. XVC 290 is a similar bus from 1959 though now shortened and converted to single deck as a tree lopper. 333 CRW and 334 CRW from 1963 are now owned by the Museum and De Courcey respectively. They have 63 seat bodies and are from the last batch of rear platform buses. KWK 23F, a 1968 Daimler rear engined Fleetline which originally had 72 seat bodywork by Eastern Coachworks with separate entrance and exit doors. PDU 125M, another Fleetline was acquired by the Museum, painted in sky blue colours and converted to open top. PDU 135M, a similar 1973 Daimler Fleetline with 74 seat body by East Lancs is typical of the standard monobus design.

Her early career was hindered by prejudice against female performers, but in 1942 she became the first woman to sing on Sudanese radio. Aisha's career continued into the 1960s, and she recorded over 150 songs in total, achieving popularity in both Sudan and Egypt. Early life Aisha was born in present day Kassala, close to the present-day border with Eritrea. Both her parents were immigrants to Sudan from Sokoto, Nigeria, having initially passed through the area as pilgrims and then later decided to settle there. Her mother, Hujra, belonged to the Hausa people, while her father, Musa Ahmad Yahiyya, was a faqīh (religious scholar) of Fulani origin. The oldest of seven children, Aisha was schooled at her father's khalwa (religious school) in Omdurman, where she learned to memorise and recite the Quran. Her later skill in singing has been attributed to her lessons in recitation. Singing career and later life Aisha began to sing professionally at the age of fourteen, and soon achieved a degree of fame as a wedding singer. Her father disapproved of her activities, as female singers were stigmatised in Sudanese society at the time. He attempted to end her career by arranging her marriage, but she subsequently divorced her husband and continued working as a singer. Aisha's career only progressed in the late 1930s, when she was discovered by a representative of an Egyptian record company. She recorded several songs for the company in Cairo, and her music subsequently became popular in Sudanese coffeehouses. Her recordings were done under the name \\"Aisha al-Falatiya\\", a reference to her Fulani ancestry. During World War II, Aisha worked as a troop entertainer, singing for Sudanese soldiers active in the East African and North African Campaigns. In 1942, she became the first female Sudanese singer to perform on radio, singing a selection of her songs for Omdurman Radio (established by the British the previous year). She performed alongside her sister, Jidawwiya, who played the oud and had her own orchestra. The sisters' performance was well-received by the station's listeners, but was condemned by conservative commentators, and several male singers subsequently boycotted the station in protest. At one point, the enduring hostility she faced (both due to her gender and her ethnicity) led her to contemplate moving to Nigeria.Malik, p. 55. Aisha's continued popularity eventually legitimised the presence of women on public radio, and in her later years she even performed duets with male singers. In total, she recorded over 150 songs during her career, mainly for Omdurman Radio, and remained active into the 1960s. She was best known for her love songs (referred to as tom-tom songs, and generally written by male poets),Malik, p. 140. but some of her music was political in nature, and she was known as an advocate of women's rights, workers' rights, anti-colonialism, and Sudanese independence. Aisha lived in Omdurman until her death in 1974, but was also a frequent visitor to Egypt. She was married twice in her life: She got divorced from her first husband, Ibrahim Adbarawi, after two years without having a child. Subsequently, she married Jiddu Kabli with whom she had all her children.

Taxonomy and systematics  The white-throated toucanet was originally described in the genus Pteroglossus. Although not accepted yet by all authorities, the white-throated toucanet was split from the emerald toucanet to form a separate species. The Santa Marta toucanet and the grey- throated toucanet were both formerly considered as a separate species (Aulacorhynchus lautus and Aulacorhynchus griseigularis respectively) until lumped as a subspecies of the white-throated toucanet in 2016. Alternative names for the white-throated toucanet include the Andean toucanet, greyish- throated toucanet, north Andean toucanet, northern Andean toucanet and southern emerald toucanet.  Subspecies  Four subspecies are recognized: * Santa Marta toucanet (A. a. lautus) - Bangs, 1898: Originally described as a separate species. Found in the Santa Marta mountains of northern Colombia * Grey-throated toucanet (A. a. griseigularis) - Chapman, 1915: Originally described as a separate species. Found in northern western Andes and western slope of central Andes (western and central Colombia) * (A. a. phaeolaemus) - Gould, 1874: Originally described as a separate species. Found on western slope of western Andes (western Colombia) * (A. a. albivitta) - (Boissonneau, 1840): Found on eastern slope of Central Andes, Eastern Andes (central, eastern Colombia), western Venezuela, eastern Ecuador Description Like other toucans, the white-throated toucanet is brightly marked and has a large bill. The adult is long and weight can range from . The sexes are alike in appearance, although the female generally is smaller and slightly shorter- billed. It is, as other members of the genus Aulacorhynchus, mainly green. The vent and tail-tip are rufous. The bill is black with yellow to the upper mandible and a white band at the base of the bill. Some white-throated toucanets have a rufous patch near the base of the lower mandible. The throat of the Santa Marta toucanet is pale grey-blue and white or grey-blue in the other subspecies. The eye-ring is very dark, almost appearing blackish from a distance. The legs are dull greyish and the iris is dark.

It stars Laurie Holden and Nicole Muñoz. It was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Leah Reyes is a teenager fascinated with black magic and occult practices. Following the death of Leah's father, her grieving mother decides to move to a remote woodland house for a fresh start, forcing Leah to leave her school friends behind and join her. After a fierce argument with her mother, Leah wishes death on her and performs an occult ritual in the forest from one of her books, to summon the demon Pyewacket to kill her mother. However, Leah bonds with her mother shortly afterwards, and she soon regrets her actions. She begins to notice strange occurrences, including noises coming from the attic and piles of dirt on the floors. One night, Pyewacket appears as a shadowy entity in Leah's bedroom while she sleeps, and drags her into the forest. Waking up the next day covered in blood, Leah turns to her school friends for help, and her best friend Janice agrees to stay at Leah's house overnight to help her lift the curse. However, the following morning Leah and her mother find Janice cowering in the car, too terrified to say what happened to her. Leah contacts paranormalist Rowan Dove, who advises that the only way to stop the demon is to perform the same summoning ritual in the same place, but in reverse. He also warns that Pyewacket is a devious shape-shifter and Leah must not trust anyone until the curse is lifted. Leah returns to the forest and begins the reverse ritual, but stops when she sees her mother lying dead nearby, but also hears her mother calling out for her. In a panic, Leah calls 911, and then her friend Aaron to pick her up. Returning to the house, Leah is confronted by Pyewacket, who first takes the form of Leah's mother, then of a monstrous hag. Leah hides in the attic, and when her mother returns home, Leah is convinced that she is another of Pyewacket's illusions, so that night she douses her mother with gasoline and sets her on fire, believing that she is killing the demon. This in turn sets the house on fire, and when Aaron arrives he finds Leah unconscious outside as the house burns down. Leah is interviewed by a police detective about her mother's death. After playing a recording of Leah's 911 call where she said her mother's body was in the woods, the detective reveals that the only body the police found was a burned one in the ruins of the house. Leah realises Pyewacket tricked her into killing her mother.

Her intimate friend's Shi Pingmei and Lu Jingqing are characters in The Ivory Ring, and Lu Yin and Lu Jingqing act as the narrators of Shi Pingmei's fictionalised story.

The painting is now part of the collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France. This work was made at a time of the life of Van Gogh when he first encountered influences from Impressionists and became aware of light and color, implementing it in his paintings. This painting presages some of his most famous subsequent works, and stands out from other still lifes because of the implementation of mixed techniques and complementary colors.  Description  Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase is an oil painting on canvas measuring 73.5 by 60.5 cm which was painted in Paris in 1887. It depicts a bouquet of golden imperial fritillaries in a copper vase, the shiny patina of which (surrounded by lavender highlights) \\"reflects the color of the flowers as the motted wall stands out with a combination of blue, green and yellow shades\\" with flecks of white like \\"sparkling lights.\\" The \\"moody blues\\" and \\"vibrant golds\\" in the painting can also be appreciated in other of Van Gogh's works such as Starry night and Bedroom at Arles. This painting with its \\"thickly applied paint and convoluted brushstrokes\\" presages Van Gogh´s famous Sunflowers. Color was an important element in his work at the time it was painted, as it expresses the artist´s \\"elevated mood\\" during the period he lived with his brother Theo in Montmartre in Paris (1886-1888). This piece has been described as a \\"riotous celebration of color, texture and light,\\" as it shows how Van Gogh accomplished light and the varied ways in which he applied the paint with \\"dashes in the background, directional brushstrokes on the table, impasto highlights on the metal vase\\". Vincent, as mentioned by the Scottish painter, Archibald Standish Hartrick, was interested in a theory that stated that \\"the eye carried a portion of the last sensation it had enjoyed into the next, so that something of both must be included in every picture made\\". The inspiration for the selection of complementary colors (orange and blue in this painting), came from noticing that \\"when entering a lamplit room out of the night increases the orange effect of the light, and in the contrary case, the blue.\\" As Vincent wrote, he tried to \\"render intense colour and not a grey harmony.\\" Eugène Murer, the Impressionist painter contemporaneous with Van Gogh who owned the Fritillaries in a Copper Vase painting, considered him \\"the greatest colorist of the century after Renoir.\\" Van Gogh was always open minded about trying new painting techniques and even liked to use several in a same work. This painting is an example of this, as it mixes Pointillism in the background as \\"expression of the nature of the central focus of the painting\\" and Impressionism in the brushstrokes of the flowers and vase. Van Gogh applied these techniques inspired by Impressionists and Neo-Impressionists of the time, that would be later used in other pieces, mainly portraits and self- portraits. Signature  Out of 900 works, Van Gogh signed only about 130, Imperial Fritillaries in a Copper Vase among them (upper left corner). This means that he considered it a potential work that could be sold. The signature in the picture reads \\"Vincent\\", as he signed since he arrived to Paris and from then on. It is said that this was because French people could not pronounce his last name. Another theory states that he wanted to get away from the Van Gogh name as his ancestors were more conservative than him. He wanted to be recognized as an individual to be \\"unique\\".  Imperial fritillaries  Imperial fritillaries (Fritillaria imperialis) are bulbs that were grown in France and Germany at the end of the 19th century, nowadays they are generally seen in gardens in Europe during spring (April and May). Because of this it is assumed that Van Gogh painted this work at that time of year. The orange-red flower is also known as the imperial crown or kaiser's crown. Each bulb grows between three and ten flowers, so Van Gogh used one or two bulbs to make the bouquet depicted in this picture.

She is best known for her lifelong efforts to achieve justice, equality, education, and economic opportunity for Latino laborers. At age 58, she died from breast cancer in West Orange, New Jersey. However, she believed that the true source of her illness later in life was related to the damaging pesticides that she had worked with for years.  Early life  Govea Thorbourne was born in 1947 in Porterville, California to Juan and Margaret Govea, who were migrant workers. By the age of two, she had already began working in the fields. At an early age, she began leading boycotts, such as her very successful grape boycott in Canada. Govea Thorbourne graduated valedictorian from Bakersfield High School. She attended college for one year before deciding to join forces with Cesar Chavez in the United Farm Workers Union. Career  Govea Thorbourne began working with the United Farm Workers Union at the age of 19; however, she had been working with other migrant workers at the age of 2. Govea Thorbourne worked with the United Farm Workers and held many positions. Her most notable position was the national director of organizing. She then went on to become a labor educator at Rutgers University and Cornell University. While working for the union, she worked very closely with Cesar Chavez.  Work with the United Farm Workers Union  Govea Thorbourne began working closely with Cesar Chavez for the United Farm Workers (UFW) at age 19, since her father was a Mexican- American community leader and worked closely with Chavez. At age 21, she led boycotts in Canada that led to UFW Union contracts with a California grape company.

At above sea level, its summit is the 12th highest peak of Mexico. Jocotitlán volcano lies in the northern part of the Toluca Valley. It is part of the Eje Neovolcánico, a volcanic belt that traverses south-central Mexico. It is a stratovolcano formed by tephra and solidified lava flows. The volcano lies within the Isidro Fabela state park, a protected area of 3701 ha established in 1975. Jocotitlán was considered holy by the Mazahua and Otomi peoples. The former called it Nguemore (\\"sacred mountain\\"), while the latter called it Gumidi (\\"he who sits facing straight forward\\"). In Pre-Columbian Mexico, the volcano held a sanctuary for Otontecuhtli, the Otomi king of the gods, also known to the Nahua people as fire god Xiuhtecuhtli. The volcano has also held a Catholic chapel since the 1980s. At , it is probably one of the highest chapels in Mexico. Jocotitlán is a potentially active volcano, having erupted at least twice in the last 10,000 years. A series of cinder cones lying just north of the Jocotitlán volcano shows how intense the volcanic activity in the region is. If it erupts, the volcano could pose a serious threat to Greater Toluca and even Greater Mexico City. The volcano can be easily climbed from the town of Jocotitlán. A winding 19 km country lane leads up to the microwave antenna located near the summit.

History  This park is located in the land that used to be part of Santa Anita Ranch. In Santa Anita Ranch they used to cultivate alfalfa to feed cows and horses on the property. Water was supplied by three wells which were regenerated in the rainy seasons by streams running through the land were the park is today. At the end of the 19th century, the cultivation of fruit trees was very popular in the area. The most abundant were the tejocotes (a Mexican fruit). Ash trees also abounded in the region, the same ones that are part of the landscape today. This part of the municipality remained unchanged until 1958, when the president Adolfo López Mateos carried out the necessary expropriations and turn the land to one of the most iconic parks of the municipality. There is a church in the park that is called Church of Our Lord of the Good Handling (Iglesia de Nuestro Señor del Buen Despacho, in Spanish) and it is located in what used to be a small chapel of the 17th century. The origins of the temple are from the 19th century. In 1959 the last reshuffle was made to the church.

The Vortex's wind turbine is not actually a turbine since it does not rotate. It is based on the phenomenon of aeroelastic resonance, harnessing energy from the wind on the emission of Von Karman's vortexes. This process is called Vortex Shedding or Vortex Street Effect, and it is usually a problem for architecture and aeronautics. Thanks to this phenomenon the device is able to oscillate with a little movement which needs no lubricants. This technology under development is more similar in features to solar power than to regular wind power, designed for self- production and distributed energy off the grid on low consumption systems.  Vortex technology  Vortex Bladeless is a vortex induced vibration resonant wind generator, as compared to HAWT (horizontal axis wind turbines) and VAWT (vertical axis wind turbines) that work by rotation. Vortex's innovation comes from its unusual shape and way of harnessing energy by oscillation, where a fiberglass and carbon fiber mast oscillates in the wind taking advantage of the emission of Von Karman's vortexes when a fluid passes through a slender structure. At the bottom of the mast a carbon fiber rod moves an alternator that generates the electricity with no moving parts in contact. Since Vortex devices don't rotate they cannot be technically called \\"turbines\\". This new technology seeks to overcome issues related to traditional wind turbines such as maintenance, amortization, noise, birds and environmental impact, logistics, and visual aspects. According to the company, Vortex generators have a small carbon footprint and use a low amount of raw materials compared to regular wind turbines of the same height. It is expected to have a low centre of gravity that allows for small foundation dimensions and a very low \\"wake turbulence\\", so several Vortex generators can be placed in the same area of a traditional turbine, increasing this way the low energy density that wind power has. However the goal of the company is not to be competitors of current wind industry but to offer a small-wind alternative for the end-consumer market and low-consumption systems, which is a market not really exploited by conventional wind power. Vortex is a vertical, slender and cylinder-shaped device. It is composed of a fixed piece where the device is attached to a base anchoring, and a flexible part which, acting as a cantilever, interacts freely with the fluid in an oscillation movement. It could be divided into two main parts, mast and base. It has no gears or moving parts in contact, so it needs no oils nor lubricants as happens with regular wind turbines. The device's operation barely requires maintenance and operative costs. All these features take them closer to solar power's features and make it perfect for distributed energy. A linear alternator transforms mechanical energy into electricity. It counts with neodymium magnets and its stator is located inside of the mobile part of the device. While converting mechanical energy into electricity, the alternator cushions the induced oscillation movement and simultaneously it is able to modify the natural oscillation frequency of the bladeless turbine's structure, therefore the lock-in range is increased while maintaining the resonance frequency in higher wind speeds. The company patented a mechanism called \\"tuning system\\" for this task, based in magnetic repulsion. Unlike regular wind turbines, this phenomenon is able to modify the apparent elasticity constant of the structure which depends on the oscillation amplitude, allowing it to grow as long as the wind speed grows. In spite of its simplicity, 6 families of registered patents protects the design and technology worldwide.  Bladeless wind devices  Vortex Bladeless is currently working in two future products that are expected to be commercially available for 2021. The specs goals for each model are: *Vortex Nano: 1 meter high and 3W nominal power output. Designed mainly to bring energy to off-grid locations for low consumption systems, working along with solar panels. Stage: pre-production of a first beta series *Vortex Tacoma: 2.75 meters high and 100W nominal power output. Designed mainly for small-scale residential/rural wind power self-generation, working along with solar panels. Stage: prototype, under development *Vortex Atlantis/Grand: Projected but not under development yet. Between 9-13 meters high and around 1kW nominal power output. Designed for residential/rural self-generation and complimentary installation to solar PV over buildings/factories. On Vortex technology, the amount of energy harnessed grows exponentially squared by height and cubed by wind speed. Therefore, bigger Vortex devices would be desirable since the production costs won't grow as much as power generation with height, giving as a result more profitable and efficient devices able to work with higher winds. However, because of their SME condition, the company is currently only working on these small-wind devices.  Story and biography  Vortex Bladeless Ltd. is a wind energy Spanish startup that was formalised in 2012 by David Yáñez, David Suriol and Raúl Martín, but it wasn't until 2014 when they officially founded the company and could be exclusively dedicated to the development of Vortex. The original idea emerged in 2002 when David Yáñez, the inventor, saw a video of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster and led him to the idea that there is a lot of energy contained on the physical principle that collapsed the bridge, and it could be harnessed as a new way of generating energy from wind. His idea was kept in a drawer for years until 2012 when they started to look for investors and funding to start the project. In early 2014, Vortex obtained public funding from CDTI (Center of Development of Industrial Technology) and started to collaborate with BSC (Barcelona SuperComputing Center) and their huge computational resources for the simulations on VIV (Vortex Induced Vibrations), magnetic fields interactions, and FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics) researches needed for their development. The proof of concept was validated and the story of Vortex began winning the South Summit Award 2014 in the category of Energy and Industry. In 2015, the company started collaboration with representatives from MIT and Harvard University. In USA the project reached the company Altair Engineering who offered their advanced simulation software to Vortex for their investigation on this particular fluid dynamics concept. On the other hand, NGOs and other environmental entities like Birdlife have shown great interest in this solution and have offered their collaboration too, since Vortex may have a lower impact on nature and birds in the case of bigger devices are built in the future. Thanks to all the support from these public administration and research centers, in 2015 the company launched in June a successful crowdfunding campaign to fund the first supplying agreements and hiring the engineers needed to take the project to the next level. In late 2016 and after validating the technology on computational simulations and tech demonstrators, the company reached the prototype stage with a geometry that can harness a nice amount of energy from the wind with this principle. On this stage Vortex was able to apply for funding from the Horizon 2020 for research and innovation programme of the European Commission. Being the greatest funding that the company had, Vortex built a big wind tunnel for testing their turbines (the tallest wind tunnel in Spain) and started the development of their patented concept of an oscillating alternator with tuning system. On this phase, the company won the \\"Seal of Excellence\\" of the H2020 programme. All along 2017, the company kept developing their alternator and tuning system. Since this technology is considered as new in many aspects intervening (geometry, movement, energy conversion system), it has been a harder development than the company expected. The collaboration on this stage of the Microgravity Institute of the Technical University of Madrid and the European University of Madrid, alongside CDTI, Altair, Birdlife and BSC were the key to obtain a feasible technology that can harness energy from the wind on this particular way. In this year the company obtained the \\"Innovation SME\\" seal of the Spanish government. In 2018 the company started to plan the industrialisation of their aerogenerators. On this point the company faced many problems due to the lack of feasible industrial processes to mass-produce some of the pieces that use Vortex technology. The geometry and the materials were almost definitive on this stage so the company started a certification process for their current prototypes and obtained the ISO 9001. This certification is a regular process for every wind turbine in the European and American market but the norm is written for blade-based or rotating turbines, so the norm may need to be rewritten in order to certify Vortex devices as wind generators. The goals of the company for the future are to obtain the certification needed to start selling, to set up a feasible method of production and logistics of shipping so they can start commercializing first Vortex turbines for 2020.

In its heart the pipeline performs quality control over the input sequencing reads, clusters the marker gene nucleotide sequences at a requested phylogenetic level (e.g. 97% for species level) into OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or sequence variants and taxonomically annotates them by looking for similar sequences in a reference taxonomic database. The main output from the QIIME pipeline is a feature table, which describes the abundances of each OTU or sequence variant in each sample. Additional tools that are relevant to ecological aspects of the samples being investigated are also provided within the pipeline, including rarefaction, alpha diversity and beta diversity calculations, visualizations such as principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) and much more. QIIME presents a very modular approach and allows multiple methods to be applied in many stages of the analysis. For example, the stage of sequences clustering can be performed using either UCLUST, CD-HIT, BLAST and more. QIIME is under active development since its release in 2010.

Pierce was the youngest in his family born from a former slave on a farm in Baldwyn, Mississippi on March 5, 1892. He began carving at a young age using a pocket knife. He first started carving animals because of his prior life of growing up on a farm. Pierce was honored with the National Heritage Fellowship for his art and influence in the woodcarving community in 1982.  Early life  Elijah Pierce began woodcarving at the age of seven, when his father gave him his first pocketknife. His uncle, Lewis Wallace, taught him how to carve more complex pieces. Pierce would give away his carvings to other children at his school. As a teenager, Pierce decided he did not want to work as a farmer like his father. He began to hang out at the local barbershop, and this is where he found another passion of his. Aside from being a skilled woodcarver, Pierce was also a renowned barber. Many of Pierce's carving were done for his wives. In the 1920s, Pierce made an entire zoo of wood carved animals for his wife, Cornelia. Each animal represented a different story, sometimes referencing the beasts of Genesis, or animals from folktales of his youth. Pierce's favorite work of his own was the Book of Wood, quite literally a large wooden book that Pierce carved into. The book portrayed the story of Jesus. The Book of Wood was the first type of carving Pierce ever made differing from his typical small sculptures. He would go on to make many more carvings similar to the Book of Wood, each with its own story and universal theme.  Accomplishments  Elijah Pierce was honored to participate in exhibitions at galleries such as the Krannert Art Museum, the Phyllis Kind Gallery of New York, the National Museum of American Art, and the Renwick Gallery. In 1973, Pierce won first prize in the International Meeting of Naive Art in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. He was a recipient of a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. That year's fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA. His work is in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum, and in the permanent collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Pierce is generally regarded and commemorated as one of the greatest and most influential woodcarvers from within the past few centuries. The Martin Luther King Jr. Performing and Cultural Arts Complex in Columbus, Ohio named the Elijah Pierce Gallery in his honor. The Columbus Museum of Art has over 300 pieces of his work. Much of Pierce's work and influence was not appreciated until after his death.  Family  Pierce was born to two former slaves. His uncle, Lewis Wallace, taught him how to take his woodcarving to the next level. Pierce married his first wife, Zetta Palm, and had a son with her. Palm died during the birth of their son. In September 1923, Pierce would marry Cornelia Houeston, his second wife. At the age of 61, Houeston died of cancer in 1948. In 1949, Pierce would marry his third and final wife, Estelle Green. Pierce remained distant from his only son.

As a two-year-old in 2009 she won three of her four races including the Grade I Hanshin Juvenile Fillies and won the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Filly. In the following year she won the Oka Sho and Yushun Himba before completing the Triple Crown in the Shuka Sho and winning the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly. In the following spring she won her fifth Grade I race when she defeated the Japanese Horse of the Year Buena Vista in the Victoria Mile. She never won again and was retired after developing a leg problem in September 2012. Apart from her victories she finished third in consecutive runnings of the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup. Background Apapane is a bay mare with a white blaze and white socks on her hind legs bred in Japan by Northern Farm the breeding operation of her owner Makoto Kaneko. Apapane was trained throughout her racing career by Sakae Kunieda and was ridden in most of her starts by Masayoshi Ebina. Her sire, King Kamehameha was one of the best Japanese colts of his generation, beating a field including Heart's Cry and Daiwa Major in the 2004 Japanese Derby. His other winners as a breeding stallion include Lord Kanaloa, Rose Kingdom, Belshazzar (Japan Cup Dirt) and Rulership (Queen Elizabeth II Cup). King Kamehameha was named after a Hawaiian monarch: his daughter Apapane was named after a native Hawaiian bird whose feathers were once used to decorate the capes of the island's nobility. Apapane's dam Salty Bid was an American-bred mare who raced in Japan and won three times as well as finishing second in the Grade III Fairy Stakes. She was a distant female-line descendant of the influential American broodmare Escutcheon. Racing career=2009: two- year-old season On 5 July 2009 Apapane made her first appearance in a contest for previously unraced two-year-olds over 1800 metres at Fukushima Racecourse and finished thord of the sixteen runners behind the colt Lordship. The filly was then off the course for three and a half months before recording her first victory in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse. Two weeks later she won the Akamatsu Sho over the same course and distance in a record time of 1.34.5. On 13 December the filly was stepped up in class to contest the Grade I Hanshin Juvenile Fillies, Japan's most prestigious race for two-year-old fillies over 1600 metres on firm ground at Hanshin Racecourse. Starting at odds of 3.6/1 she won by half a length and three quarters of a length from Animate Bio with the favoured Shimmei Fuji in fifth. In January 2010 Apapane was voted Champion two-year-old filly in the JRA Awards for 2009. 2010: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut Apapane contested the Grade III Tulip Sho over 1600 metres on yielding ground at Hanshin on 6 March and was beaten three quarters of a length into second place by Shoryu Moon. On 11 April, on firmer ground, the filly started favourite for the 70th running of the Grade I Oka Sho, the first leg of Japan's Fillies' Triple Crown over the same course and distance. She raced close behind the leaders as Oken Sakura set the pace but looked unlikely to obtain a clear run until Ebina switched her to the outside to make her challenge in the straight. She overtook Oken Sakura in the closing stages to win by half a length in a new track record time of 1:33.3. A Shin Returns took third ahead of Shoryu Moon whilst Animate Bio finished eighth of the eighteen runners. On 23 May the filly was stepped up in distance and started favourite for the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Grade I Yushun Himba over 2400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse. Oken Sakura, A Shin Returns, Shoryu Moon and Animate Bio were again in the field as well as the Grade II Flora Stakes winner Saint Emilion. On a wet and gloomy day she tracked the leaders before moving to the outside on the final turn. The last 200 metres saw the race develop into a sustained struggle between Apapane and Saint Emilion and with neither filly able to establish an advantage the pair crossed the line together, two lengths clear of the other sixteen runners. After a ten-minute delay during which the racecourse judges scrutinised the photo-finish the result was declared as a dead-heat. After a summer break, Apapane returned in autumn with the third leg of the triple crown, the Shuka Sho as her objective. She prepared for the race with a run in the Grade II Rose Stakes over 1800 metres at Hanshin in September. Racing for the first time in almost four months she finished fourth of the twelve runners behind Animate Bio, Wild Raspberry and A Shin Returns. On 17 October Apapane faced seventeen rivals including Saint Emilion, Animate Bio, Wild Raspberry, A Shin Returns, Shoryu Moon, and Oken Sakura in the Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. She completed the Triple Crown, beating Animate Bio by three quarters of a length. On her final run of the season Apapane was matched against older fillies and mares in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup over 2200 metres at Kyoto on 14 November. She started the 1.7/1 favourite but was beaten into third place by the British filly Snow Fairy. In January 2011 Apapane picked up her second JRA Award as she was named champion three-year-old filly of 2010 with 284 of the 285 votes. 2011: four-year-old season Apapane was matched against male opposition on her first appearance of 2011 and finished fourth behind Silport, Clever Tosho and Danon Yoyo in the Grade II Milers Cup at Hanshin on 17 April. Four weeks later the filly returned to Grade I class and all-female competition for the Victoria Mile over 1600 metres on firm ground at Tokyo and started 3/1 second choice in the betting. She faced several of her old rivals from her three-year-old days including Animate Bio, A Shin Returns, Oken Sakura and Wild Raspberry, but by far her most formidable opponent was the outstanding five-year-old racemare Buena Vista who started the 1/2 favourite. Drawn towards the wide outside of the seventeen runner field she was restrained towards the rear before making a strong late run in the straight. She overtook Lady Alba Rosa and Oken Sakura and then held off the challenge of Buena Vista to win by a neck. In June she started favourite for the Yasuda Kinen but finished sixth behind the three-year-old colt Real Impact, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. After the summer break Apapane returned in the Grade II Fuchu Himba Stakes at Tokyo in October in which she started favourite but finished unplaced behind Italian Red. In November she replicated her 2010 performance in the Queen Eliabeth II Commemorative Cup as she finished third to Snow Fairy. On her final run of the year she was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Mile on 11 December. After racing prominently in the early stages she faded in the straight and finished thirteenth of the fourteen runners behind Able One. 2012: five- year-old season Apapane remained in training as a five-year-old but failed to reproduce her best form and failed to win in three races. She finished seventh in the Grade II Hanshin Himba Stakes, fifth in her attempt to repeat her 2012 success in the Victoria Mile and sixteenth in the Yasuda Kinen. She was being prepared for an autumn campaign when she began to suffer from lameness owing to what was described as \\"superficial digital flexor tendonitis\\".

The Principal Group was a group of interrelated Canadian financial companies that collapsed in 1987, resulting in losses to an estimated 67,000 people. Losses were in recovered in part through provincial governments paying compensation, based on findings as to deficiencies in regulatory oversight.Brian Brennan, Principal Group Collapse: The Man Who Knew\\". Extracted from Boondoggles, Bonanzas, and Other Alberta Stories, Fifth House Publishers, 2003, as reprinted in Business Edge, January 6, 2004. History The Principal Group was primarily three companies: First Investors Corporation, Associated Investors of Canada and Principal Savings and Trust Corporation. First Investors Corporation was established by Donald Cormie in 1954. The company was initially based in Edmonton, Alberta. The company sold investment contracts, which were contracts by which investors remitted monthly amounts to First Investors Corporation, in return for a promised future redemption amount, plus interest. In 1959, First Investors opened offices in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. At the same time, it also opened offices in Washington, Oregon and Colorado as Principal Investors, since the First Investors name was owned in the United States by another party.Now known as Foresters Financial: \\"First Investors Changes Its Brand Name to Foresters Financial\\". News Release, September 21, 2015. retrieved 2016-11-05. Associated Investors of Canada was acquired in 1962. The companies were subject to Alberta Securities Commission regulation and also required licenses to sell investment contracts. Alberta regulatory concerns were expressed as early as 1961, which concerns continued until the demise of the companies some twenty- five years later. These concerns related to excessive valuations of transactions and the general solvency of the companies, among other matters. On June 30, 1987, Alberta Treasurer Dick Johnston cancelled the operating licenses of First Investors Corporation and Associated Investors of Canada. Six weeks later, the Principal Group filed for bankruptcy, owing more than 67,000 investors approximately $468 million ($ billion today).Uncredited, Principal investors getting final payment.
