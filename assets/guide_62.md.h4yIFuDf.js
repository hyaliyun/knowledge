The deer live in a mainly suburban environment and have developed (according to a study) home range areas on the island. Hilton Head white- tailed deer are listed as a \\"species of concern\\" by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service although culling of the deer is regularly approved in order to reduce the population and prevent accidents. The culls caused controversy amongst area residents and wildlife groups. Before culling was approved many of the deer were relocated across the island to spread out the herd. Sea Pines Plantation, a mixed residential and natural area, became a site of controversy when residents complained about the deer eating their shrubbery, and causing property damage. A University of Georgia professor formulated a plan to cut the subspecies population in half, which was met with a lawsuit against the University by local wildlife groups seeking to stop the program. The professor stated that the animals lack a natural predator on the island. On August 27, 1998, an injunction by a local judge temporarily blocked any killing of the population. The South Carolina Legislature designated Sea Pines a state wildlife sanctuary in 1971, but a circuit judge agreed that culling of the deer population was legal in 1999. The South Carolina Supreme Court concurred with the ruling and allowed the culling to proceed so long as it was regulated by the state. Subsequently there has been little opposition to the population reduction program, and after only three years the size of the herd had been reduced by 500. Deer-vehicle collisions were also reduced from 60 per year to 10 per year.

The authors' goal is to help make the plight of women and girl offenders visible because, as the authors argue, in society's neglect of girls and women: \\"we begin to deny our own humanity and the humanity of those we imprison\\". The book highlights how theories and research on crime and delinquency have historically ignored women and girls and that they were forgotten altogether during the second wave of feminism. Women and girls were an afterthought of a system designed for men. The authors explain that more recent research has shown how women's and girls' victimization narrows their choices and provide the background for their entrance into unemployment, prostitution or survival sex, drug use and abuse, homelessness and other criminal acts. The authors explain that girls' pathways to crime are further affected by the gendered nature of society. The authors also discuss the increased rates of women's and girls' imprisonment in the 21st century, and ask: \\"What led these women into criminal behaviour? Are today's women more violent than their counterparts in the past decades? How could such a change in public policy towards women (that led to their increased imprisonment) have happened with so little fanfare?\\" They explain that society must stop punishing girls and women based on myths bolstered by bad information and instead seek recourse in the real causes of their offending. As well, the lack of civil rights guaranteed to youth makes their arrest possible and normal, in the case of girls, even when they are fleeing horrific situations. Chesney-Lind and Pasko explain that the answer to the last question, how could the dramatic increase in the prison population of women, lies in the societal anxiety that surrounds women and girl offenders. Furthermore, because the majority of people are arrested and imprisoned are poor and therefore without a voice and the authors argue to counter these challenges we must focus attention on girls and women offender, engage them as persons, listen to their story and ultimately turn the prisoner into a person. The authors claim that to fix these problems we could choose not to imprison marginalized girls and women, as we often do for white women and girls. They posit this would be unlikely to cause a surge in crime as most women and girls are in need of training, education and support, not punishment. They also suggest society should work to strengthen the bond between women, their communities and their children. The authors support their claims by showing that the increased imprisonment of women is not a result of new crimes and that decreases in the prison population would not only save taxpayers money but could be achieved through policy changes. The authors end the book by explaining that if society can begin to stop relying on imprisonment for women we can begin to consider this approach for men as well. They explain that the majority of male offenders are also marginalized by racism and poverty and furthermore, that they are the brothers, fathers and sons of marginalized women.Chesney-Lind, M. & Pasko, L., (2004). The female offender: Girls, women and crime. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. Article synopsis - \\"What About the Girls: Delinquency and Programming as if Gender Mattered\\". In this article Meda Chesney-Lind discusses some of the problems with programming for girls who come in contact with the criminal justice system. She posits that despite increased arrests of young girls, they are almost always invisible when the delinquency problem is discussed and largely forgotten when programs for delinquents are designed. In this article Chesney-Lind argues: (1) that girls in the justice system and invisible in terms of programming and that their risk factors differ than boys; (2) that programming is often based on a one issue at a time approach which ignores the interrelatedness of girls' problems; (3) that girls are triply marginalized, by their age, race and class, structural inequalities and institutional racism and programs must therefore empower and advocate for meaningful changes and (4) that although statistics show an increase in girls violence, often resulting in more punitive sanctions, this is not the case as girl violence has simply been historically ignored. The claims made by Chesney-Lind are conceptual. Her claims relate to notions and ideas about girls and programming. However, they would not have come about without earlier empirical studies and research from which her claims developed. For example, her claim that girls are triply marginalized and that programming must empower and advocate for meaningful change would not have developed as such without an analysis of the empirical studies that claim girls' violence is increasing. As well, her claim that girls' in the justice system are invisible in terms of programming would not have been possible without the empirical research that showed statistically that girls lack programs designed specifically for them. The evidence, both empirical and conceptual, Chesney-Lind supplies supports her claims. She draws from a wide variety of sources to show that girls are forgotten when programs for delinquents are crafted. As well, her argument that girls are almost always invisible when delinquency is discussed is supported by evidence that shows girls' violence/offending has been historically ignored as well as the development of programs that address issues one at a time. This approach is not conducive to the interrelatedness of girls' problems. Furthermore, focusing on risk factors such as substance and drug abuse would be more suited for boys than girls whose risk factors are more internalizing.Chesney-Lind, M., (2001). What about the girls? Delinquency programming as if gender mattered. Corrections Today. pp. 38-45. Article synopsis - \\"From Invisible to Incorrigible: The Demonization of Marginalized Women and Girls\\". In this article Chesney-Lind and Eliason discuss the ways in which popular culture (media, books, movies etc.) as well as academic discourses have aided in the demonization of adult lesbians and adolescent girls. The authors explore how and why some feminist scholars have either ignored or contributed to the criminalizing of behaviours that are considered non-feminine. The authors argue that a backlash against women's progress has led to the vilification of females who show signs of masculinity and while popular culture often depicts women offenders as masculinised or sexualized white women that the backlash actually affects women of colour, poor women and lesbian/bisexual women. The authors explain that 'bad girls', that is, those girls whom the feminist movement has encouraged to seek, not only equality in the social realm, but also equality in the male world of crime. Girls are viewed as masculinised monsters and it is believed they commit crimes for the same reasons as men. Following this line of reasoning, theories of violence and crime do not need to include gender specific ideology but instead can simply apply male theories to women and girls. However, simply because a few girls and women behave in aggressive, violent, abusive or mean ways does not devalue gender-based theories of crime, aggression and violence. Furthermore, girls, women and even boys and men take in conflicting messages embedded in culture. They grow up in a world that accepts and valorizes male violence. The authors support this claim by explaining that because masculinity is equated with power, girls and women may seek to gain power, control and respect by acting out in violent, masculine ways. However, they often commit horizontal violence, that is, their crimes are not committed against the males who threaten them but instead commit crimes against members of their own group, other marginalized girls, and women. In the case of lesbians, crimes are often against other lesbians or their partner. The authors also argue that the masculinised construction of women and girl offenders serves solely to increase punitive sanctions against these groups and sends a message to all women: if you deviate from the feminine norm you may be arrested and incarcerated. They support this claim by pointing out that most evidence shows that women are not committing more violent acts and instead evidence shows that certain groups of women are being constructed in popular culture as masculine and violent. They highlight this through describing various analyses of the 2003 film Monster. The authors also claim that the media and criminal justice system play an important role in controlling women through the masculinisation and demonization of a few women. This construction casts these groups out of the protective sphere of femininity while the criminal justice system moves in to process and punish them. The authors suggest that female violence does not disprove gender-based theories of violence and that more studies of women and girls violence are needed that do not equate masculinity or femininity as individual attributes. Lastly, Chesney-Lind and Eliason posit that until male and female aggression is understood, not only in the context of patriarchy which oppresses both sexes but also within the social systems of racism, heterosexism and classism, increases in arrest rates, incarceration and the execution of masculinised women will continue.Chesney-Lind, M. & Eliason, M., (2006).

A member of the Canadian League of Composers and an associate of the Canadian Music Centre, she twice won the Canada Council's Lynch-Staunton Award for composition. She has been commissioned to write works for such organizations as the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Electronic Ensemble, The Music Gallery, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the National Ballet of Canada, the Quebec Contemporary Music Society, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and York Winds among others. She is an honorary member of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community and has served on the juries of the SOCAN Awards and the Jules L√©ger Prize for New Chamber Music. In 1988 she donated many of her original manuscripts, papers, and recordings to the library at the University of Calgary. Early life and education Born in Oshawa, Beecroft is the daughter of Julian Beecroft, a musician and inventor who was a pioneer in the development of electronic tape, and actress Eleanor Beecroft (n√©e Chambers). She received her earliest musical education from her parents, both of whom had a significant amount of musical training. Her father had originally intended to pursue a career as a concert pianist and had performed in concerts in his early 20s. His career, however, was cut short when he lost three of his fingers in a tragic woodworking accident. Her parents married in 1931 and their marriage produced four other children besides Norma. They divorced in 1947 when she was 13 years old. In 1950 Beecroft began taking private piano lessons with Aladar Ecsedy, studying with him until she entered The Royal Conservatory of Music (RCMT) in 1952. She attended classes at the RCMT through 1958 where her professors included Gordon Hallett (piano), Weldon Kilburn (piano), and John Weinzweig (music theory and composition). In 1957-1958 she studied the flute privately with Keith Girard and in the summer of 1958 was a pupil at the Berkshire Music Center where she studied composition with Aaron Copland and Lukas Foss. In 1959 Beecroft went to Rome to pursue graduate studies in composition with Goffredo Petrassi at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. She remained in that city through 1962 where she also continued studies in the flute privately with Severino Gazzelloni. In the summers of 1960 and 1961 she attended lectures taught by Bruno Maderna in Darmstadt, Germany and at the Dartington School in England. In 1962 she returned to Canada to pursue courses in electronic music at the University of Toronto with Myron Schaeffer. After completing these studies, she went to New York City to work with Mario Davidovsky at the Columbia- Princeton Electronic Music Center in 1964. Career Beecroft began her career working as a script assistant for television music programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from 1954-1957. From 1956-1957 she served as the president of Canadian Music Associates, the Toronto concert committee of the Canadian League of Composers. She continued to work for the CBC in a variety of capacities, including music consultant (1957‚Äì1959), script assistant (1962‚Äì1963), talent relations officer (1963‚Äì1964), and national program organizer for radio (1964‚Äì1966). From 1966-1969 she was a producer for CBC Radio for such programs as Organists in Recital, RSVP, and From the Age of Elegance. She also hosted and produced the program Music of Today during these years and, after resigning as a producer at CBC in 1969, continued to host and commentate for that program in the 1970s. She also served as the president of Ten Centuries Concerts from 1965-1968. She is among a generation of pioneering professional electronic music composers. From 1967 to 1976 she worked independently in the Electronic Music Studio inside the Edward Johnson Building (UTEMS) of the University of Toronto, Faculty of Music. Because of her reputation as a composer she was one of the first non-students to be able to experiment in the new facility. There she focused on multitrack recording and looping as an extension of existing instrumental or vocal sounds. Her podcast Conversations With Post World War II Pioneers of Electronic Music features some of the fellow composers around that time. During the 1970s, Beecroft was busy working as a freelance radio producer, notably creating numerous documentaries for CBC Radio on Canadian composers like Jean Coulthard, Harry Freedman, Bruce Mather, Barbara Pentland, Harry Somers, Gilles Tremblay, and John Weinzweig among others. She also created documentaries on composers Murray Adaskin and Violet Archer for CJRT-FM. In 1975 she put together 13 broadcast records entitled Music Canada that contained music taken from recordings in the collections at the libraries of Radio Canada International and the Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada. In 1976 she won the Major Armstrong Award for excellence in FM broadcasting for her documentary The Computer in Music. She later produced electronic music scores for William Shakespeare's Macbeth (1982) and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1983) at the Stratford Festival. In 1971 Beecroft co-founded the New Music Concerts (NMC) with composer and flutist Robert Aitken. The NMC was founded with the purpose of providing a performance venue for new music as well as providing performers with opportunities to further master modern performance techniques. Beecroft served as the organization's president through 1989. She was a member of the music faculty at York University from 1984-1987 where she taught classes in electronic music and composition. She has since returned there as a guest lecturer and worked in that capacity at the University of Montreal as well.

The request is a ruse to enable Pym to marry his wealthy American fianc√©e June Farrell (Helen Backlin) while she's still in England and before she has to return home to America. His master plan backfires when he finds himself swept into the election campaign and beaten by the more politically experienced Mr Cleghorn (Tom Macaulay), the Labour Party candidate. After losing the election, his family take the news calmly, but his fianc√©e is mortified, and he must now devise a plan to win her back. When Cleghorn is made a Peer, Viscount Pym stands again for the newly vacant seat, however this time he fights the campaign as a Socialist candidate but is beaten once again, this time by the family butler Beecham (Cecil Parker) - a steadfast Conservative.

Anthony Steel has one of his earliest roles in the film. Critical reception Bosley Crowther in The New York Times noted \\"a somewhat slapdash lot of fooling. It rambles all over the place and is perilously uneven in its humorous attack. But it does offer several stinging sideswipes at the \\"plutocrats, peers and parasites,\\" and kids class distinctions and traditions in a pleasantly good- natured way. In the title role of the butler, Cecil Parker‚Äîhe who played the pompous colonel in the last episode of \\"Quartet\\"‚Äîis delightfully foolish and mannered, but A. E. Matthews as the butler's ranking boss, a beautifully addle-brained old codger, runs away with the show. Mr. Matthews' illustration of the complacence of an impoverished earl may not be wholly consistent but it glistens brightly in spots. David Tomlinson also does nicely as the thoroughly light-weight young lord and Lana Morris, Tom Macaulay and Marjorie Fielding are amusing in other roles.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DEEDD1F3BE23BBC4E51DFB4678382659EDE ReferencesExternal links * Category:1949 films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:1949 romantic comedy films Category:British romantic comedy films Category:British films based on plays Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films scored by Benjamin Frankel Category:1949 comedy films ","title":"The Chiltern Hundreds (film)"},{"id":"26900828","text":"Label of company from 1930 to 1939 Syrena Record was a Polish record company.

Located on a flat two-part bluff, the site was formerly used as pasture until the middle of the 20th century, when it came under cultivation. The resulting plowing brought up enough artifacts to warrant further investigation of the site, and in 1954, archaeologists conducted a test excavation. Among the artifacts discovered during this process were pottery, bones, and stone chips.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 408. Archaeologists believe that the Winegardner Village was once occupied by a Middle or Late Woodland people. It is one of several Woodland period villages in the area, and its position atop a bluff overlooking Little Rush Creek gives it a defensive advantage that has often been cited in archaeological analysis of the site. Artifacts such as broken pottery and fire-burned stones have been seen as evidence that the site was occupied by a dense population.

The vehicle, a black Audi A6 bearing diplomatic license plates, was later identified as being driven by Dr Silviu Ionescu, at the time Charg√© d'Affaires ad interim of the Romanian Embassy in Singapore. At approximately 3 am, the vehicle ran two red lights and hit the pedestrians on a pedestrian crossing, injuring two and killing one. Approximately 40 minutes after the incident, Ionescu reported the vehicle as being stolen. The car was later found abandoned in Sungei Kadut approximately 4 hours after the collisions. Singapore began an investigation into the incident. Romanian authorities also commenced an investigation into the incident on 6 January 2010, and formally indicted Ionescu on charges on 2 February. A Singapore coroner's inquiry held in early March 2010 determined the vehicle had not been stolen and was being driven by Ionescu at the time of the incident. Ionescu, who had left Singapore three days after the incident, declined to return to Singapore for the proceedings. Singapore authorities have used diplomatic law to interview Ionescu's driver, but Romania has declined several requests to extradite Ionescu himself. Ionescu was arrested by Romanian authorities in May 2010. His trial in Romania began in July 2010, and in March 2013, he was sentenced to 3 years' jail after being found guilty of manslaughter, negligent bodily injury and leaving the scene of a crash. Ionescu appealed, with the result arriving in February 2014, with the Court of Appeal upholding his conviction and doubling his sentence from 3 years to 6 years. Incident At approximately 3 am on 15 December 2009, Malaysians Tong Kok Wai, 30, his friend Bong Hwee How, 24, and Singaporean Muhd Haris Abu Talib, 18, were crossing at the pedestrian crossings in Bukit Panjang. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a black Audi A6 with diplomatic license plates run through two red traffic lights before striking the three men. Bong suffered severe head injuries, including post-traumatic amnesia. Tong suffered the most severe of injuries. After three days in hospital, he slipped into a coma and was pronounced brain dead on 18 December 2009. He was taken off life support on 25 December. The abandoned Audi was later recovered by police in the Sungei Kadut neighbourhood. Ionescu had reported the vehicle as stolen approximately 40 minutes after the incident. According to his police statement, Ionescu drove the car to his diplomatic office shortly before 3 am. Shortly thereafter, he noticed the car was missing, at which time he reported it stolen. He then asked his driver, Marius Trusca, to drive him around in search of the car. After 20 minutes of searching, he took a taxi to his private residence. Police reports filed in a Singapore court differ from Ionescu's account. Police say Ionescu's driver was not working the night of the incident and was not called in to look for the vehicle until almost 9 am, rather than 3 am as reported by Ionescu. Three days after the incident, Ionescu left Singapore to return to Romania. Actions by Singaporean agencies On 6 January 2010, the Romanian prosecutor's office opened a criminal investigation and officially requested information about the case from Singaporean authorities. On 28 January 2010, Singapore police revealed they had evidence that Ionescu was the driver in the hit-and-run. His presence, as well as that of his Romanian driver, was requested for the coroner's inquest into Tong's death. Singapore completed a coroner's inquiry into the events on 31 March 2010. Based on the witnesses (one of whom identified Ionescu as the driver at the time of the incident) and evidence presented by police in the coroner's inquiry, it was concluded that Ionescu was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the incident. In response to the allegations, Ionescu said, \\"Honestly, I don't believe in the court of Singapore\\". Actions by Romanian agencies The Romanian Foreign Ministry has distanced itself from Ionescu since he was excused from his diplomatic position, saying his statements carry the weight of any common citizen. The Romanian government has taken action against Ionescu. He was recalled from his post in Singapore with effect from 5 January 2010 and the case had been referred to the Romanian Prosecutor's Office. The Romanian Foreign Ministry also suspended Ionescu from his duties following the Romanian Prosecutor's Office's starting a criminal investigation regarding the incident. Since the coroner's inquiry, a \\"joint technical committee\\" was established between Singapore and Romania, which intends to pursue legal action against Ionescu. Pending such action, Singapore has filed 13 charges against Ionescu and as well as issued an arrest warrant against him. The Romanian government seized a property in Bucharest belonging to Ionescu on 3 February 2010 with the aim of \\"satisfying the claims of the civil parties.\\" Meanwhile, Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for Ionescu in April 2012. Public response The fact that Ionescu could not be brought back to Singapore for trial due to diplomatic immunity and the absence of an extradition treaty between Singapore and Romania has triggered much public outrage in Singapore. There was also outcry in Malaysia as the deceased was a Malaysian who was working in Singapore. The family of the deceased sought help from the Malaysian government, but were turned down as it was considered an internal matter between Singapore and Romania.  Romanian arrest and sentencing  Ionescu was arrested by Romanian authorities in May 2010. On 1 July 2010, the Romanian State Prosecutor charged Ionescu with culpable homicide, grievous bodily harm with intent, deserting the place of an accident and providing false evidence to the police. On 27 March 2013, a Bucharest district court found Ionescu guilty of manslaughter, negligent bodily injury and leaving the scene of an accident, so he was sentenced to 3 years' jail. Ionescu's appeal kept him out of jail and led to the case being brought to the Bucharest's Court of Appeal, with Ionescu twice filing for postponements. On 13 February 2014, the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction and doubled his sentence from 3 years to 6 years, after taking into account the State Prosecution Service's arguments that Ionescu showed no remorse for a grave crime which he continued to deny despite the weight of the evidence against him, and that he had deformed Romania's international reputation. In response, the Singapore government welcomed the decision.  Death of Ionescu  On 9 December 2014, Ionescu died in a Bucharest jail hospital due to cardiorespiratory problems. It was less than a year after his final sentencing.

Santa Marina is a church in C√≥rdoba, Spain. It is one of the so- called \\"Fernandinean Churches,\\" built in C√≥rdoba after Ferdinand III of Castile conquered the city in 1236 CE. The structure combines proto-Gothic, Mud√©jar and, to a lesser degree, late-Romanesque elements. History The church, one of the oldest of the Fernandinean group, was built in the second half of the 13th century on the site of what had previously been a mosque and before that a 7th-century Visigothic church. No trace of these remains today. On 23 June 1880, the church was damaged in a fire, which required a restoration project that lasted two years. Other renovations were carried out in the 19th and 20th centuries; as part of these, the medieval appearance of the building was restored by the removal of the Baroque additions introduced as part of the repairs that followed the 1680 and 1755 earthquakes. The church has been a national monument since 1931. Overview The church has a rectangular, basilica plan, divided into a nave and two aisles, the nave being far higher than the latter. The aisles are separated from the nave by large pointed arches. The facade is characterized by four large, asymmetrical buttresses, ending with pinnacles, and corresponding to the interior separation between nave and aisles. Also present are a main central rose window, smaller circular windows, and alfizes over the ogival arch of the main portal. The facade corresponding to the left aisle features a secondary portal, surmounted by a triangular arch. The apses are polygonal. In the right aisle is the sacristy, built in the 15th century. The left aisle apse was adapted to house a Baroque chapel from 1630. The bell tower dates to the 16th century. The \\"retablo\\" of the Main Chapel houses paintings by Antonio del Castillo and sculptures from the local artist G√≥mez de Sandoval.

(This is also known in the UK as the three canons of credit - capacity, collateral, and character.) To help the underwriter assess the quality of the loan, banks and lenders create guidelines and even computer models that analyze the various aspects of the mortgage and provide recommendations regarding the risks involved. However, it is always up to the underwriter to make the final decision on whether to approve or decline a loan.  Risks for the lender  Risks for the lender are of three forms: interest rate risk, default risk, and prepayment risk. There is a risk to the lender that the rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage may decrease. If this is not matched by correlated decreases in rates on the lender's liabilities, profits will suffer. If a rate on a mortgage contract increases significantly, this is normally favorable to the lender in the absence of correlated increases in rates on liabilities. However, the lender faces the risk that the interest rate increase could be unaffordable to the borrower, forcing the borrower into default, in which case it could be necessary to foreclose on the property (with substantial costs of foreclosure). In addition, the lender faces the risk that the value of the property underlying the mortgage could drop in value to below the outstanding balance on the mortgage; if this event induces the borrower to default due to moral hazard, the lender must not only incur the costs of implementing a foreclosure but also must sell the property at a price that fails to recoup the lender's investment. One additional risk for lenders is prepayment. If market interest rates drop, a borrower could refinance the fixed-rate mortgage, leaving the lender with an amount that now can be invested only at a lower rate of return. This risk can be mitigated by various sorts of prepayment penalties that will make it unprofitable to refinance even if the rates of other lenders decrease.

It first opened in 1927 as 'New Hebrides Training School.' Its educational status varied over the decades. In 1974, the Aore School was upgraded to that of a high school, and was renamed Aore Adventist High School. It was previously Parker Missionary School. In 1994, the school's board changed the name to Aore Adventist Academy. In 2009, the school's enrolment totalled 194 students and 17 teachers. Location Aore Adventist Academy is situated on the southern coast of the island of Aore. Aore is part of the nation of Vanuatu, an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean. It is some east of northern Australia, northeast of New Caledonia, west of Fiji, and southeast of the Solomon Islands, near New Guinea. Vanuatu was known as the New Hebrides before achieving independence. The school buildings are located near the shoreline close to workshops, a hospital (now reassigned to other uses) and a slipway. History=Training school beginnings In 1925, the small island of Aore was chosen as the regional Adventist mission station. A fund raising campaign began. The 8 March 1926 edition of the Australasian Record included the following poem reminding the division's sabbath schools of the project's offering at the end of the month. Adventist mission boat, 1926, Loloma, had its home port at the Aore school. In 1927, the church secured the property on Aore. In the early years of the school, a clear title to the land was difficult to establish. A sawmill was built. The newly acquired regional mission boat, Loloma, located there as well. They used the Loloma to bring the students to the school. Aore soon became the focal point of Adventist work in the New Hebrides. Pastor J. R. James, the mission superintendent, and a party of young New Hebrideans moved in with axes to clear the land and establish a school. Students have followed in increasing numbers, and the educational and spiritual work of this institution has been the heart of the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) Adventist Mission. World War II and after The war came to the New Hebrides. The United States arrived and took control before the Japanese could do so. On the island of Espiritu Santo, 100,000 troops arrived. The native population \\"were astounded at the apparent equality with which black and white military personnel were treated. When they went to work for the Americans, they received respect and wages far in excess to anything they had ever experienced before. The typically generous Americans would also look at the native New Hebridean living conditions and give them clothes and beds, ice boxes and furniture.\\" Two years before, the Australasian Adventist leadership prepared an evacuation plan. In 1942, Aore Training School closed. The non- native workers returned to Australia. Native leaders attended to the church's mission in their absence. They carefully maintained church property and led in the Sabbath services. When the missionaries returned they were impressed with the level of competence these native leaders demonstrated. In 1943, the school reopened. In 1951, the mission council decided to move its headquarters to Sarakata, in Luganville on the adjacent island of Espiritu Santo. This allowed room for the school to expand. The mission headquarters was later relocated to Port Vila in 1983, following the transition to Vanuatu's independence in 1980. 1980, the nation of Vanuatu Vanuatu achieved independence from the condominium rule of the United Kingdom and France in 1980. By this time, the demographics and transportation routes had changed. When compared to the cost of public transportation, the Adventist mission boat, Pacifique, was considered too expensive to operate. Apart from the school, Aore ceased to hold a prominent place in the Vanuatu Adventist mission.

In 1934 her code letters were replaced with the call sign GQMW. Clan Matheson was a cargo ship, and also served as a cadet training ship. In 1924 the Levuana Moth (Levuana iridescens) was a serious pest to coconut palms in Fiji and a biological solution was devised. A similar moth, Artona catoxantha was known to be parasitized by Ptychomyia and Apanteles, so it was decided to use these parasites to eradicate the Levuana Moth. The parasites had to be imported from Singapore to Fiji. Most ships at that time sailed not direct but via Australia, which would have meant putting the parasites into quarantine in Australia. Clan Line operated ships in the area. In July 1924 was sailing from Singapore to Fiji via other ports, and Clan Matheson was also due to sail from Java to Fiji. Clan Mackay took the parasites to Surabaya, Java, where they were transferred to Clan Matheson for onward shipment to Fiji. No Apanteles survived, but the Ptychomia did and their introduction succeeded in eradicating the Levuana Moth within two years. Second World War In the Second World War Clan Matheson sailed in convoys. =OG 3= In October 1939 Clan Matheson carried general cargo from Britain to East Africa. She joined Convoy OG 3, which formed at sea on 17 October 1939 and took her as far as Gibraltar. =OG 22= Clan Matheson was a member of Convoy OG 22, which formed at sea on 18 March 1940 bound for Gibraltar. =HX 228= In February 1943 Clan Matheson loaded sugar and general cargo in North America.

HX 229 left New York on 8 March 1943 bound for Liverpool, and Clan Matheson was meant to sail with the convoy as far as Loch Ewe, but she was unable to maintain speed and put into Halifax, Nova Scotia. Post war In 1948 Clan Matheson was sold to British & South American Steam Navigation Co Ltd, which renamed her Harmodius and appointed Houston Line Ltd to manage her. In 1951 she was sold to the Heron Steamship Co Ltd of London who renamed her Claire T. In 1953 she was sold to the Romney Steamship Co Ltd, serving until 1955 when she was purchased by the MoT and renamed Empire Claire. As part of Operation Sandcastle she was loaded with obsolete war materiel which included confiscated German munitions containing Tabun. Loaded with 16,000 bombs, On 27 July 1955 Empire Claire was towed out of Stranraer and scuttled in the North Atlantic 800 miles northwest of County Donegal, Ireland at .

Chapters existed at Mount Union College, University of Michigan, Monmouth College, Northwestern University, Moore's Hill, Ohio Wesleyan University, University of Virginia, Denison University, Westminster College (Pennsylvania), Western University of Pennsylvania. A national Kappa Phi Lambda convention was held in Philadelphia in 1867. Following that convention, the Denison University chapter became disenchanted with the authoritarianism of the national leadership and joined the Beta Theta Pi. Following dissolution in 1874, the Mount Union College chapter joined Delta Tau Delta, the University of Michigan chapter joined Psi Upsilon, and the Northwestern University chapter joined Sigma Chi. The last known chapter of Kappa Phi Lambda was at Westminster College (Pennsylvania). It operated sub-rosa until 1920, and petitioned Phi Gamma Delta. In 1948, it became the Epsilon Pi chapter of Sigma Nu. Kappa Phi Lambda is considered one of the members of the \\"Jefferson Triad\\" of fraternities founded at Jefferson College, with the other two being Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Kappa Psi.

Closed to rail traffic in 1986, it is now an extension of the Cynwyd Heritage Trail (along the river's right bank) and connects to the Schuylkill River Trail (along the left bank). History The deck of the bridge in 1999, after the rails had already been removed Built by the former Schuylkill Valley Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, it is a large concrete open spandrel arch bridge built in an \\"S curve,\\" earning both the current concrete bridge and its 1883 wrought-iron-truss predecessor the nickname of \\"S-Bridge.\\" The bridge's challenging geometry was executed by T. L. Eyre, a Philadelphia contractor. Another notable feature is the saw-toothed construction joints along a 65-degree skew. In 1976, SEPTA purchased the bridge for its Ivy Ridge Line (now Cynwyd Line). Ten years later, after weather-related expansion and contraction of the bridge, and the shedding of pieces of concrete due to spalling, SEPTA closed the bridge on October 25, 1986, truncating service at Cynwyd and suspended service to three of the line's six stations (Ivy Ridge, Manayunk, and Walnut Hill). Between 1996 and 1999, the bridge was stabilized and refurbished. The effort determined that the internal steel reinforcement was not compromised, as SEPTA had feared. Further investigation by Urban Engineers determined that the bridge was safe and only needed surface work to stop the spalling. SEPTA has not resumed service to Ivy Ridge; in 1996 low ridership led SEPTA to consider discontinuing service to Cynwyd altogether. Manayunk Bridge Trail Walkers on the Manayunk Bridge Trail in October 2015, shortly after the trail opened Between 2008 and June 2010, SEPTA removed all of tracks north of Cynwyd for the Cynwyd Heritage Trailcynwydtrail.org and Ivy Ridge Rail Trail.Ivy Ridge Green On October 30, 2015 the ribbon was cut on the Manayunk Bridge Trail, a conversion of the bridge for use by people walking and bicycling.

Born in Hungary, he became a naturalized Canadian citizen in 1961. An associate of the Canadian Music Centre, he was a founding member of ARRAYMUSIC, an organization which premiered several of his compositions.  Life  Born in Nagytevel, John Fodi moved to Canada with his family in 1951 at the age of 7. His father played both the accordion and concertina and John began performing music at an early age; but it was at the public library in Hamilton, Ontario, that he discovered the resources to develop his understanding of music. Finding the accordion increasingly unsatisfactory as a means of exploring classical music he decided to learn to play the piano. This was the instrument which he would use for both the study and composition of music throughout his life. During this period he composed over 40 pieces which reflected the progress of his studies, in particular his fascination with the music of the baroque period. In 1964, while working as a laboratory technician for Firestone, he began studying music privately with Lorne Betts in the city of Hamilton, Ontario. It was Betts who encouraged and mentored John in the study of contemporary music. In 1966 he entered the music program at the University of Toronto (UT) where he earned a Bachelor of Music in 1970 and a Master of Music in 1972. At UT he founded the Contemporary Music Group in 1967, directing the organization through 1970. During this period he was the recipient of numerous awards including the Canadian League of Composers prize (1968, 1970,) the CAPAC St Clair Lowe Award (1970) and a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (1970). Among his teachers at the UT were John Beckwith (music composition), Gustav Ciamaga(electronic music), and John Weinzweig (composition). He also pursued studies in composition at McGill University (MU) with Istv√°n Anhalt in 1970-1971; during which time he and Mickey Cohen co-founded the New Music Society at MU. In 1973 he participated in the Composers Conference at Johnson State College, Vermont, and the Gaudeamus Music Week in the Netherlands. That same year he represented Canada at the ISCM in Iceland. In 1976 John submitted his string quartet, Concerto a Quattro, directly to the ISCM and it was chosen by the organization for performance in Boston, Massachusetts. From 1972 to 1974 he augmented his income as a composer by working as a copyist for other composers, several publishers, and the Canadian Music Centre. He would continue working as a copyist into the 1990s. In 1973 and 1974 he also taught composition as an \\"artist in the classroom\\" through the Ontario Arts Council's \\"Creative Artists in Schools\\" programme. In 1974 John began working at the Edward Johnson Music Library, University of Toronto, as a library technician. He became a recordings cataloguer and, in 1982, supervisor of the recordings section. In 1990 he earned a Master of Library Science from the University of Toronto.

The bounds are important tools in the design and analysis of certain methods in telecommunication engineering, particularly in coding theory. The bounds were originally published in a 1974 paper by L. R. Welch. Mathematical statement If {x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m} are unit vectors in \\\\mathbb{C}^n, define c_\\\\max = \\\\max_{i eq j} \\\\langle x_i, x_j \\\\rangle, where \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle is the usual inner product on \\\\mathbb{C}^n. Then the following inequalities hold for k=1,2,\\\\dots: : (c_\\\\max)^{2k} \\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{m-1} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{m}{\\\\binom{n+k-1}{k}}-1 \\\\right] Applicability If m\\\\leq n, then the vectors {x_i} can form an orthonormal set in \\\\mathbb{C}^n. In this case, c_\\\\max=0 and the bounds are vacuous. Consequently, interpretation of the bounds is only meaningful if m>n. This will be assumed throughout the remainder of this article. Proof for k = 1 The \\"first Welch bound,\\" corresponding to k=1, is by far the most commonly used in applications. Its proof proceeds in two steps, each of which depends on a more basic mathematical inequality. The first step invokes the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality and begins by considering the m\\\\times m Gram matrix G of the vectors {x_i}; i.e., : G=\\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccc} \\\\langle x_1, x_1 \\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\langle x_1, x_m \\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ \\\\langle x_m, x_1 \\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\langle x_m, x_m \\\\rangle \\\\end{array}\\\\right] The trace of G is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. Because the rank of G is at most n, and it is a positive semidefinite matrix, G has at most n positive eigenvalues with its remaining eigenvalues all equal to zero. Writing the non-zero eigenvalues of G as \\\\lambda_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_r with r\\\\leq n and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the inner product of an r-vector of ones with a vector whose components are these eigenvalues yields : (\\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\;G)^2 = \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^r \\\\lambda_i \\\\right)^2 \\\\leq r \\\\sum_{i=1}^r \\\\lambda_i^2 \\\\leq n \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\lambda_i^2 The square of the Frobenius norm (Hilbert-Schmidt norm) of G satisfies : G^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\langle x_i , x_j \\\\rangle^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\lambda_i^2 Taking this together with the preceding inequality gives : \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\langle x_i , x_j \\\\rangle^2\\\\geq \\\\frac{(\\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\;G)^2}{n} Because each x_i has unit length, the elements on the main diagonal of G are ones, and hence its trace is \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\;G = m. So, : \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\langle x_i , x_j \\\\rangle^2 = m+\\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\langle x_i , x_j \\\\rangle^2 \\\\geq \\\\frac{m^2}{n} or : \\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\langle x_i , x_j \\\\rangle^2 \\\\geq \\\\frac{m(m-n)}{n} The second part of the proof uses an inequality encompassing the simple observation that the average of a set of non-negative numbers can be no greater than the largest number in the set. In mathematical notation, if a_{\\\\ell}\\\\geq 0 for \\\\ell=1,\\\\ldots, L, then : \\\\frac{1}{L}\\\\sum_{\\\\ell=1}^L a_{\\\\ell} \\\\leq \\\\max a_{\\\\ell} The previous expression has m(m-1) non-negative terms in the sum, the largest of which is c_\\\\max^2. So, : (c_\\\\max)^2\\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{m(m-1)}\\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\langle x_i , x_j \\\\rangle^2\\\\geq\\\\frac{m-n}{n(m-1)} or : (c_\\\\max)^2\\\\geq \\\\frac{m-n}{n(m-1)} which is precisely the inequality given by Welch in the case that k=1. Achieving Welch bound equality In certain telecommunications applications, it is desirable to construct sets of vectors that meet the Welch bounds with equality. Several techniques have been introduced to obtain so-called Welch Bound Equality (WBE) sets of vectors for the k = 1 bound. The proof given above shows that two separate mathematical inequalities are incorporated into the Welch bound when k=1. The Cauchy- Schwarz inequality is met with equality when the two vectors involved are collinear. In the way it is used in the above proof, this occurs when all the non-zero eigenvalues of the Gram matrix G are equal, which happens precisely when the vectors {x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m} constitute a tight frame for \\\\mathbb{C}^n. The other inequality in the proof is satisfied with equality if and only if \\\\langle x_i, x_j \\\\rangle is the same for every choice of i eq j. In this case, the vectors are equiangular. So this Welch bound is met with equality if and only if the set of vectors {x_i} is an equiangular tight frame in \\\\mathbb{C}^n.

Each edge of the tetrahedron is a 20 base pair DNA double helix, and each vertex is a three-arm junction. The 4 DNA strands that form the 4 tetrahedral faces are color-coded.300px DNA nanotechnology is the design and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses. In this field, nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning to be used as a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated. The conceptual foundation for DNA nanotechnology was first laid out by Nadrian Seeman in the early 1980s, and the field began to attract widespread interest in the mid-2000s. This use of nucleic acids is enabled by their strict base pairing rules, which cause only portions of strands with complementary base sequences to bind together to form strong, rigid double helix structures. This allows for the rational design of base sequences that will selectively assemble to form complex target structures with precisely controlled nanoscale features. Several assembly methods are used to make these structures, including tile-based structures that assemble from smaller structures, folding structures using the DNA origami method, and dynamically reconfigurable structures using strand displacement methods. The field's name specifically references DNA, but the same principles have been used with other types of nucleic acids as well, leading to the occasional use of the alternative name nucleic acid nanotechnology. Fundamental concepts These four strands associate into a DNA four-arm junction because this structure maximizes the number of correct base pairs, with A matched to T and C matched to G. See this image for a more realistic model of the four-arm junction showing its tertiary structure. This double-crossover (DX) supramolecular complex consists of five DNA single strands that form two double-helical domains, on the top and the bottom in this image. There are two crossover points where the strands cross from one domain into the other.Overview: Properties of nucleic acids Nanotechnology is often defined as the study of materials and devices with features on a scale below 100 nanometers. DNA nanotechnology, specifically, is an example of bottom-up molecular self-assembly, in which molecular components spontaneously organize into stable structures; the particular form of these structures is induced by the physical and chemical properties of the components selected by the designers.Background: In DNA nanotechnology, the component materials are strands of nucleic acids such as DNA; these strands are often synthetic and are almost always used outside the context of a living cell. DNA is well-suited to nanoscale construction because the binding between two nucleic acid strands depends on simple base pairing rules which are well understood, and form the specific nanoscale structure of the nucleic acid double helix. These qualities make the assembly of nucleic acid structures easy to control through nucleic acid design. This property is absent in other materials used in nanotechnology, including proteins, for which protein design is very difficult, and nanoparticles, which lack the capability for specific assembly on their own. The structure of a nucleic acid molecule consists of a sequence of nucleotides distinguished by which nucleobase they contain. In DNA, the four bases present are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will only bind to each other to form a double helix if the two sequences are complementary, meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs, with A only binding to T, and C only to G.Background: Because the formation of correctly matched base pairs is energetically favorable, nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind to each other in the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases. The sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way. In DNA nanotechnology, the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation. While DNA is the dominant material used, structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) have also been constructed.RNA nanotechnology: RNA nanotechnology: Subfields DNA nanotechnology is sometimes divided into two overlapping subfields: structural DNA nanotechnology and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. Structural DNA nanotechnology, sometimes abbreviated as SDN, focuses on synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials that assemble into a static, equilibrium end state. On the other hand, dynamic DNA nanotechnology focuses on complexes with useful non- equilibrium behavior such as the ability to reconfigure based on a chemical or physical stimulus. Some complexes, such as nucleic acid nanomechanical devices, combine features of both the structural and dynamic subfields.Dynamic DNA nanotechnology: The complexes constructed in structural DNA nanotechnology use topologically branched nucleic acid structures containing junctions. (In contrast, most biological DNA exists as an unbranched double helix.) One of the simplest branched structures is a four-arm junction that consists of four individual DNA strands, portions of which are complementary in a specific pattern. Unlike in natural Holliday junctions, each arm in the artificial immobile four-arm junction has a different base sequence, causing the junction point to be fixed at a certain position. Multiple junctions can be combined in the same complex, such as in the widely used double-crossover (DX) structural motif, which contains two parallel double helical domains with individual strands crossing between the domains at two crossover points. Each crossover point is, topologically, a four-arm junction, but is constrained to one orientation, in contrast to the flexible single four-arm junction, providing a rigidity that makes the DX motif suitable as a structural building block for larger DNA complexes. Dynamic DNA nanotechnology uses a mechanism called toehold-mediated strand displacement to allow the nucleic acid complexes to reconfigure in response to the addition of a new nucleic acid strand. In this reaction, the incoming strand binds to a single-stranded toehold region of a double-stranded complex, and then displaces one of the strands bound in the original complex through a branch migration process. The overall effect is that one of the strands in the complex is replaced with another one. In addition, reconfigurable structures and devices can be made using functional nucleic acids such as deoxyribozymes and ribozymes, which can perform chemical reactions, and aptamers, which can bind to specific proteins or small molecules.Dynamic DNA nanotechnology: Structural DNA nanotechnology Structural DNA nanotechnology, sometimes abbreviated as SDN, focuses on synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials where the assembly has a static, equilibrium endpoint. The nucleic acid double helix has a robust, defined three-dimensional geometry that makes it possible to predict and design the structures of more complicated nucleic acid complexes. Many such structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures, and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.Structural DNA nanotechnology: Extended lattices Left, a model of a DNA tile used to make another two-dimensional periodic lattice. Right, an atomic force micrograph of the assembled lattice.Other arrays: Small nucleic acid complexes can be equipped with sticky ends and combined into larger two-dimensional periodic lattices containing a specific tessellated pattern of the individual molecular tiles. The earliest example of this used double-crossover (DX) complexes as the basic tiles, each containing four sticky ends designed with sequences that caused the DX units to combine into periodic two-dimensional flat sheets that are essentially rigid two- dimensional crystals of DNA.DX arrays: DX arrays: Two-dimensional arrays have been made from other motifs as well, including the Holliday junction rhombus lattice,Other arrays: and various DX-based arrays making use of a double- cohesion scheme.Other arrays: Other arrays: The top two images at right show examples of tile-based periodic lattices. Two-dimensional arrays can be made to exhibit aperiodic structures whose assembly implements a specific algorithm, exhibiting one form of DNA computing. The DX tiles can have their sticky end sequences chosen so that they act as Wang tiles, allowing them to perform computation. A DX array whose assembly encodes an XOR operation has been demonstrated; this allows the DNA array to implement a cellular automaton that generates a fractal known as the Sierpinski gasket. The third image at right shows this type of array.Algorithmic self-assembly: Another system has the function of a binary counter, displaying a representation of increasing binary numbers as it grows. These results show that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays.Algorithmic self-assembly: DX arrays have been made to form hollow nanotubes 4‚Äì20 nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube.DNA nanotubes: In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.DNA nanotubes: Forming three-dimensional lattices of DNA was the earliest goal of DNA nanotechnology, but this proved to be one of the most difficult to realize. Success using a motif based on the concept of tensegrity, a balance between tension and compression forces, was finally reported in 2009.Three-dimensional arrays: Discrete structures Researchers have synthesized many three-dimensional DNA complexes that each have the connectivity of a polyhedron, such as a cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex.Overview: The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra.DNA polyhedra: Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA octahedron made from a long single strand designed to fold into the correct conformation,DNA polyhedra: and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in one step, pictured at the top of this article.DNA polyhedra: Nanostructures of arbitrary, non-regular shapes are usually made using the DNA origami method. These structures consist of a long, natural virus strand as a \\"scaffold\\", which is made to fold into the desired shape by computationally designed short \\"staple\\" strands. This method has the advantages of being easy to design, as the base sequence is predetermined by the scaffold strand sequence, and not requiring high strand purity and accurate stoichiometry, as most other DNA nanotechnology methods do. DNA origami was first demonstrated for two-dimensional shapes, such as a smiley face, a coarse map of the Western Hemisphere, and the Mona Lisa painting. Solid three-dimensional structures can be made by using parallel DNA helices arranged in a honeycomb pattern,DNA origami: and structures with two-dimensional faces can be made to fold into a hollow overall three-dimensional shape, akin to a cardboard box. These can be programmed to open and reveal or release a molecular cargo in response to a stimulus, making them potentially useful as programmable molecular cages.DNA boxes: DNA boxes: Templated assembly Nucleic acid structures can be made to incorporate molecules other than nucleic acids, sometimes called heteroelements, including proteins, metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, and fullerenes. This allows the construction of materials and devices with a range of functionalities much greater than is possible with nucleic acids alone. The goal is to use the self-assembly of the nucleic acid structures to template the assembly of the nanoparticles hosted on them, controlling their position and in some cases orientation.Overview: Many of these schemes use a covalent attachment scheme, using oligonucleotides with amide or thiol functional groups as a chemical handle to bind the heteroelements. This covalent binding scheme has been used to arrange gold nanoparticles on a DX-based array,Nanoarchitecture: and to arrange streptavidin protein molecules into specific patterns on a DX array.Nanoarchitecture: A non-covalent hosting scheme using Dervan polyamides on a DX array was used to arrange streptavidin proteins in a specific pattern on a DX array.Nanoarchitecture: Carbon nanotubes have been hosted on DNA arrays in a pattern allowing the assembly to act as a molecular electronic device, a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor.Nanoarchitecture: In addition, there are nucleic acid metallization methods, in which the nucleic acid is replaced by a metal which assumes the general shape of the original nucleic acid structure,Nanoarchitecture: and schemes for using nucleic acid nanostructures as lithography masks, transferring their pattern into a solid surface.Nanoarchitecture: Dynamic DNA nanotechnology Dynamic DNA nanotechnology often makes use of toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions. In this example, the red strand binds to the single stranded toehold region on the green strand (region 1), and then in a branch migration process across region 2, the blue strand is displaced and freed from the complex. Reactions like these are used to dynamically reconfigure or assemble nucleic acid nanostructures. In addition, the red and blue strands can be used as signals in a molecular logic gate. Dynamic DNA nanotechnology focuses on forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities related to their overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, or can be made to form dynamically in the first place. Nanomechanical devices DNA complexes have been made that change their conformation upon some stimulus, making them one form of nanorobotics. These structures are initially formed in the same way as the static structures made in structural DNA nanotechnology, but are designed so that dynamic reconfiguration is possible after the initial assembly. The earliest such device made use of the transition between the B-DNA and Z-DNA forms to respond to a change in buffer conditions by undergoing a twisting motion.DNA machines: This reliance on buffer conditions caused all devices to change state at the same time. Subsequent systems could change states based upon the presence of control strands, allowing multiple devices to be independently operated in solution. Some examples of such systems are a \\"molecular tweezers\\" design that has an open and a closed state,DNA machines: a device that could switch from a paranemic-crossover (PX) conformation to a double-junction (JX2) conformation, undergoing rotational motion in the process,DNA machines: and a two-dimensional array that could dynamically expand and contract in response to control strands.DNA machines: Structures have also been made that dynamically open or close, potentially acting as a molecular cage to release or reveal a functional cargo upon opening.DNA machines: Applications: DNA walkers are a class of nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit directional motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control the motion of the walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence.DNA walkers: DNA walkers: Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously.DNA walkers: DNA walkers: A later system could walk upon a two- dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo.Functional DNA walkers: Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA- templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker.Functional DNA walkers: The synthetic DNA walkers' function is similar to that of the proteins dynein and kinesin. Strand displacement cascades Cascades of strand displacement reactions can be used for either computational or structural purposes. An individual strand displacement reaction involves revealing a new sequence in response to the presence of some initiator strand. Many such reactions can be linked into a cascade where the newly revealed output sequence of one reaction can initiate another strand displacement reaction elsewhere. This in turn allows for the construction of chemical reaction networks with many components, exhibiting complex computational and information processing abilities. These cascades are made energetically favorable through the formation of new base pairs, and the entropy gain from disassembly reactions. Strand displacement cascades allow isothermal operation of the assembly or computational process, in contrast to traditional nucleic acid assembly's requirement for a thermal annealing step, where the temperature is raised and then slowly lowered to ensure proper formation of the desired structure. They can also support catalytic function of the initiator species, where less than one equivalent of the initiator can cause the reaction to go to completion. Strand displacement complexes can be used to make molecular logic gates capable of complex computation.Fuzzy and Boolean logic gates based on DNA: Unlike traditional electronic computers, which use electric current as inputs and outputs, molecular computers use the concentrations of specific chemical species as signals. In the case of nucleic acid strand displacement circuits, the signal is the presence of nucleic acid strands that are released or consumed by binding and unbinding events to other strands in displacement complexes. This approach has been used to make logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT gates.Strand displacement cascades: More recently, a four-bit circuit was demonstrated that can compute the square root of the integers 0‚Äì15, using a system of gates containing 130 DNA strands.Strand displacement cascades: Another use of strand displacement cascades is to make dynamically assembled structures. These use a hairpin structure for the reactants, so that when the input strand binds, the newly revealed sequence is on the same molecule rather than disassembling. This allows new opened hairpins to be added to a growing complex. This approach has been used to make simple structures such as three- and four-arm junctions and dendrimers. Applications DNA nanotechnology provides one of the few ways to form designed, complex structures with precise control over nanoscale features. The field is beginning to see application to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics. The earliest such application envisaged for the field, and one still in development, is in crystallography, where molecules that are difficult to crystallize in isolation could be arranged within a three-dimensional nucleic acid lattice, allowing determination of their structure. Another application is the use of DNA origami rods to replace liquid crystals in residual dipolar coupling experiments in protein NMR spectroscopy; using DNA origami is advantageous because, unlike liquid crystals, they are tolerant of the detergents needed to suspend membrane proteins in solution. DNA walkers have been used as nanoscale assembly lines to move nanoparticles and direct chemical synthesis. Further, DNA origami structures have aided in the biophysical studies of enzyme function and protein folding. DNA nanotechnology is moving toward potential real-world applications. The ability of nucleic acid arrays to arrange other molecules indicates its potential applications in molecular scale electronics. The assembly of a nucleic acid structure could be used to template the assembly of a molecular electronic elements such as molecular wires, providing a method for nanometer-scale control of the placement and overall architecture of the device analogous to a molecular breadboard. DNA nanotechnology has been compared to the concept of programmable matter because of the coupling of computation to its material properties.Applications: In a study conducted by a group of scientists from iNANO and CDNA centers in Aarhus University, researchers were able to construct a small multi-switchable 3D DNA Box Origami. The proposed nanoparticle was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The constructed box was shown to have a unique reclosing mechanism, which enabled it to repeatedly open and close in response to a unique set of DNA or RNA keys. The authors proposed that this \\"DNA device can potentially be used for a broad range of applications such as controlling the function of single molecules, controlled drug delivery, and molecular computing.\\" There are potential applications for DNA nanotechnology in nanomedicine, making use of its ability to perform computation in a biocompatible format to make \\"smart drugs\\" for targeted drug delivery, as well as for diagnostic applications. One such system being investigated uses a hollow DNA box containing proteins that induce apoptosis, or cell death, that will only open when in proximity to a cancer cell.Applications: There has additionally been interest in expressing these artificial structures in engineered living bacterial cells, most likely using the transcribed RNA for the assembly, although it is unknown whether these complex structures are able to efficiently fold or assemble in the cell's cytoplasm. If successful, this could enable directed evolution of nucleic acid nanostructures. Scientists at Oxford University reported the self-assembly of four short strands of synthetic DNA into a cage which can enter cells and survive for at least 48 hours. The fluorescently labeled DNA tetrahedra were found to remain intact in the laboratory cultured human kidney cells despite the attack by cellular enzymes after two days. This experiment showed the potential of drug delivery inside the living cells using the DNA ‚Äòcage‚Äô. A DNA tetrahedron was used to deliver RNA Interference (RNAi) in a mouse model, reported a team of researchers in MIT. Delivery of the interfering RNA for treatment has showed some success using polymer or lipid, but there are limits of safety and imprecise targeting, in addition to short shelf life in the blood stream. The DNA nanostructure created by the team consists of six strands of DNA to form a tetrahedron, with one strand of RNA affixed to each of the six edges. The tetrahedron is further equipped with targeting protein, three folate molecules, which lead the DNA nanoparticles to the abundant folate receptors found on some tumors. The result showed that the gene expression targeted by the RNAi, luciferase, dropped by more than half. This study shows promise in using DNA nanotechnology as an effective tool to deliver treatment using the emerging RNA Interference technology. The DNA tetrahedron was also used in an effort to overcome the phenomena multidrug resistance. Doxorubicin (DOX) was conjugated with the tetrahedron and was loaded into MCF-7 breast cancer cells that contained the P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump. The results of the experiment showed the DOX was not being pumped out and apoptosis of the cancer cells was achieved. The tetrahedron without DOX was loaded into cells to test its biocompatibility, and the structure showed no cytotoxicity itself. The DNA tetrahedron was also used as barcode for profiling the subcellular expression and distribution of proteins in cells for diagnostic purposes. The tetrahedral-nanostructured showed enhanced signal due to higher labeling efficiency and stability. Applications for DNA nanotechnology in nanomedicine also focus on mimicking the structure and function of naturally occurring membrane proteins with designed DNA nanostructures. In 2012, Langecker et al.DNA ion channels: introduced a pore-shaped DNA origami structure that can self-insert into lipid membranes via hydrophobic cholesterol modifications and induce ionic currents across the membrane. This first demonstration of a synthetic DNA ion channel was followed by a variety of pore-inducing designs ranging from a single DNA duplex,DNA ion channels: to small tile-based structures,DNA ion channels: DNA ion channels: DNA ion channels: DNA ion channels: DNA ion channels: and large DNA origami transmembrane porins.DNA ion channels: Similar to naturally occurring protein ion channels, this ensemble of synthetic DNA-made counterparts thereby spans multiple orders of magnitude in conductance. The study of the membrane-inserting single DNA duplex showed that current must also flow on the DNA-lipid interface as no central channel lumen is present in the design that lets ions pass across the lipid bilayer. This indicated that the DNA-induced lipid pore has a toroidal shape, rather than cylindrical, as lipid headgroups reorient to face towards the membrane-inserted part of the DNA. Researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign then demonstrated that such a DNA-induced toroidal pore can facilitate rapid lipid flip-flop between the lipid bilayer leaflets. Utilizing this effect, they designed a synthetic DNA-built enzyme that flips lipids in biological membranes orders of magnitudes faster than naturally occurring proteins called scramblases.DNA scramblase: This development highlights the potential of synthetic DNA nanostructures for personalized drugs and therapeutics. Design DNA nanostructures must be rationally designed so that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.Design: Structural design The first step in designing a nucleic acid nanostructure is to decide how a given structure should be represented by a specific arrangement of nucleic acid strands. This design step determines the secondary structure, or the positions of the base pairs that hold the individual strands together in the desired shape. Several approaches have been demonstrated: *Tile-based structures. This approach breaks the target structure into smaller units with strong binding between the strands contained in each unit, and weaker interactions between the units. It is often used to make periodic lattices, but can also be used to implement algorithmic self-assembly, making them a platform for DNA computing. This was the dominant design strategy used from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, when the DNA origami methodology was developed.Overview: * Folding structures. An alternative to the tile-based approach, folding approaches make the nanostructure from one long strand, which can either have a designed sequence that folds due to its interactions with itself, or it can be folded into the desired shape by using shorter, \\"staple\\" strands. This latter method is called DNA origami, which allows forming nanoscale two- and three- dimensional shapes (see Discrete structures above).DNA origami: * Dynamic assembly. This approach directly controls the kinetics of DNA self-assembly, specifying all of the intermediate steps in the reaction mechanism in addition to the final product. This is done using starting materials which adopt a hairpin structure; these then assemble into the final conformation in a cascade reaction, in a specific order (see Strand displacement cascades below). This approach has the advantage of proceeding isothermally, at a constant temperature. This is in contrast to the thermodynamic approaches, which require a thermal annealing step where a temperature change is required to trigger the assembly and favor proper formation of the desired structure.Kinetic assembly: Sequence design After any of the above approaches are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.Design: Nucleic acid design has similar goals to protein design. In both, the sequence of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design has the advantage of being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.Design: Materials and methods Gel electrophoresis methods, such as this formation assay on a DX complex, are used to ascertain whether the desired structures are forming properly. Each vertical lane contains a series of bands, where each band is characteristic of a particular reaction intermediate. The sequences of the DNA strands making up a target structure are designed computationally, using molecular modeling and thermodynamic modeling software. The nucleic acids themselves are then synthesized using standard oligonucleotide synthesis methods, usually automated in an oligonucleotide synthesizer, and strands of custom sequences are commercially available.Methods: Strands can be purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis if needed,Methods: and precise concentrations determined via any of several nucleic acid quantitation methods using ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy.Methods: The fully formed target structures can be verified using native gel electrophoresis, which gives size and shape information for the nucleic acid complexes. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay can assess whether a structure incorporates all desired strands.Methods: Fluorescent labeling and F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) are sometimes used to characterize the structure of the complexes.Methods: Nucleic acid structures can be directly imaged by atomic force microscopy, which is well suited to extended two-dimensional structures, but less useful for discrete three- dimensional structures because of the microscope tip's interaction with the fragile nucleic acid structure; transmission electron microscopy and cryo- electron microscopy are often used in this case. Extended three-dimensional lattices are analyzed by X-ray crystallography.Methods: Methods: History The woodcut Depth (pictured) by M. C. Escher reportedly inspired Nadrian Seeman to consider using three-dimensional lattices of DNA to orient hard-to- crystallize molecules. This led to the beginning of the field of DNA nanotechnology. The conceptual foundation for DNA nanotechnology was first laid out by Nadrian Seeman in the early 1980s.History: Seeman's original motivation was to create a three-dimensional DNA lattice for orienting other large molecules, which would simplify their crystallographic study by eliminating the difficult process of obtaining pure crystals. This idea had reportedly come to him in late 1980, after realizing the similarity between the woodcut Depth by M. C. Escher and an array of DNA six-arm junctions.Overview: History: See for a statement of the problem, and for the proposed solution. Several natural branched DNA structures were known at the time, including the DNA replication fork and the mobile Holliday junction, but Seeman's insight was that immobile nucleic acid junctions could be created by properly designing the strand sequences to remove symmetry in the assembled molecule, and that these immobile junctions could in principle be combined into rigid crystalline lattices. The first theoretical paper proposing this scheme was published in 1982, and the first experimental demonstration of an immobile DNA junction was published the following year.Overview: In 1991, Seeman's laboratory published a report on the synthesis of a cube made of DNA, the first synthetic three-dimensional nucleic acid nanostructure, for which he received the 1995 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology. This was followed by a DNA truncated octahedron. It soon became clear that these structures, polygonal shapes with flexible junctions as their vertices, were not rigid enough to form extended three-dimensional lattices. Seeman developed the more rigid double-crossover (DX) structural motif, and in 1998, in collaboration with Erik Winfree, published the creation of two-dimensional lattices of DX tiles. These tile-based structures had the advantage that they provided the ability to implement DNA computing, which was demonstrated by Winfree and Paul Rothemund in their 2004 paper on the algorithmic self-assembly of a Sierpinski gasket structure, and for which they shared the 2006 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology. Winfree's key insight was that the DX tiles could be used as Wang tiles, meaning that their assembly could perform computation. The synthesis of a three-dimensional lattice was finally published by Seeman in 2009, nearly thirty years after he had set out to achieve it. New abilities continued to be discovered for designed DNA structures throughout the 2000s. The first DNA nanomachine‚Äîa motif that changes its structure in response to an input‚Äîwas demonstrated in 1999 by Seeman. An improved system, which was the first nucleic acid device to make use of toehold-mediated strand displacement, was demonstrated by Bernard Yurke the following year. The next advance was to translate this into mechanical motion, and in 2004 and 2005, several DNA walker systems were demonstrated by the groups of Seeman, Niles Pierce, Andrew Turberfield, and Chengde Mao.DNA machines: The idea of using DNA arrays to template the assembly of other molecules such as nanoparticles and proteins, first suggested by Bruche Robinson and Seeman in 1987,Nanoarchitecture: was demonstrated in 2002 by Seeman, Kiehl et al.Nanoarchitecture: and subsequently by many other groups. In 2006, Rothemund first demonstrated the DNA origami method for easily and robustly forming folded DNA structures of arbitrary shape. Rothemund had conceived of this method as being conceptually intermediate between Seeman's DX lattices, which used many short strands, and William Shih's DNA octahedron, which consisted mostly of one very long strand. Rothemund's DNA origami contains a long strand which folding is assisted by several short strands. This method allowed forming much larger structures than formerly possible, and which are less technically demanding to design and synthesize.DNA origami: DNA origami was the cover story of Nature on March 15, 2006. Rothemund's research demonstrating two-dimensional DNA origami structures was followed by the demonstration of solid three-dimensional DNA origami by Douglas et al. in 2009, while the labs of J√∏rgen Kjems and Yan demonstrated hollow three-dimensional structures made out of two-dimensional faces.History/applications: DNA nanotechnology was initially met with some skepticism due to the unusual non-biological use of nucleic acids as materials for building structures and doing computation, and the preponderance of proof of principle experiments that extended the abilities of the field but were far from actual applications. Seeman's 1991 paper on the synthesis of the DNA cube was rejected by the journal Science after one reviewer praised its originality while another criticized it for its lack of biological relevance. By the early 2010s the field was considered to have increased its abilities to the point that applications for basic science research were beginning to be realized, and practical applications in medicine and other fields were beginning to be considered feasible.History: The field had grown from very few active laboratories in 2001 to at least 60 in 2010, which increased the talent pool and thus the number of scientific advances in the field during that decade.History: See also * International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering * Comparison of nucleic acid simulation software * Molecular models of DNA * Nanobiotechnology ReferencesFurther reading General: * ‚ÄîAn article written for laypeople by the founder of the field * ‚ÄîA review of results in the period 2001‚Äì2010 * ‚ÄîA more comprehensive review including both old and new results in the field * and .‚ÄîA news article focusing on the history of the field and development of new applications * ‚ÄîA very recent and comprehensive review in the field Specific subfields: * ‚ÄîA review of nucleic acid nanomechanical devices * ‚ÄîA review coming from the viewpoint of secondary structure design * ‚ÄîA minireview specifically focusing on tile-based assembly * ‚ÄîA review of DNA systems making use of strand displacement mechanisms External links * What is Bionanotechnology?‚Äîa video introduction to DNA nanotechnology ","title":"DNA nanotechnology"},{"id":"26901565","text":"Kate Lehrer (born Kate Tom Staples; December 17, 1939) is an American writer, novelist and book reviewer from Washington, D.C., and a panelist on the Diane Rehm Book Club on National Public Radio.

He holds a skull in his right hand. 16th century English. Throckmorton Collection, Coughton Court, Warwickshire. Property of the National Trust Arms of Throckmorton: Gules, on a chevron argent three bars gemelles sable Sir Robert Throckmorton (c. 1513 ‚Äì 12 February 1581), KG, of Coughton Court in Warwickshire, was a Member of Parliament and a distinguished English courtier. His public career was impeded by remaining a Roman Catholic. Origins Born by 1513, Robert Throckmorton was the eldest son and heir of Sir George Throckmorton (died 1552) by Katherine Vaux, daughter of Nicholas Vaux, 1st Baron Vaux of Harrowden (died 1523). He had several notable brothers, in descending seniority: Sir Kenelm Throckmorton, Sir Clement Throckmorton MP, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton (1515‚Äì1571), Thomas, Sir John Throckmorton (1524‚Äì1580), Anthony, and George. Politics Robert Throckmorton may have trained at the Middle Temple, the inn attended by his father. At least three of his younger brothers and his own eldest son trained there, but as the heir to extensive estates, he had little need for a career in justice or government. He was joined with his father in several stewardships from 1527 and was perhaps the servant of Robert Tyrwhitt, a distant relative by marriage of the Throckmortons, who in 1540 took an inventory of Cromwell's goods at Mortlake. He attended the reception of Anne of Cleves. With several of his brothers he took part in the French war of 1544. Three years later he was placed on the Warwickshire bench, and in 1553 appointed High Sheriff of Warwickshire. He was also elected as a knight of the shire (MP) for Warwickshire in 1553 and 1555. Three of his brothers likewise sat for Parliament, Nicholas as knight of the shire for Northamptonshire. Throckmorton's role in the succession crisis of 1553 is unknown, but his standing with Queen Mary is shown by her reputed answer to the news of Edward VI's death sent her by four of his brothers: \\"If Robert had been there she durst have gaged her life and hazarded the hap.\\" In the autumn of 1553, Throckmorton was knighted and appointed constable of Warwick Castle. He continued to sit as MP for the shire until 1558, when he resigned in favour of his eldest son, Thomas. Religion His Catholicism explains his disappearance from the Commons in the new reign, although the most Catholic of his brothers, Anthony Throckmorton, was to sit in the Parliament of 1563. Judged an \\"adversary of true religion\\" in 1564, Throckmorton remained active in Warwickshire until his refusal to subscribe to the Act of Uniformity led to his removal from the commission of the peace. In 1577, the Bishop of Worcester, John Whitgift, listed Throckmorton as a Catholic and reckoned him to be worth 1,000 marks a year in lands and ¬£1,000 in goods. Family Sir Robert Throckmorton's mother, Katherine Vaux, was the daughter of Elizabeth FitzHugh by her second marriage to Sir Nicholas Vaux. Throckmorton continued the family's Catholic tradition. He married his children into leading Catholic families, in generations when increased persecution of the Catholics led to many of his relatives becoming involved in plots against the throne. The sons of his daughters Anne and Muriel, were Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham of Gunpowder Plot fame. and a third daughter, Mary, was married to Edward Arden, who was also convicted of treason and executed for his part in a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth in 1583. Mary Arden kept an excellent record of a woman persecuted for recusancy, documenting the fines and searches made at Coughton Court, that is still in the family archives. A nephew, Francis Throckmorton, was executed in 1584 for acting as a go-between for Mary, Queen of Scots and the Spanish Ambassador in an attempt to invade England and place Mary on the throne. A niece Elizabeth, also known as Bess, the daughter of Sir Nicholas, and a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth, also offended by secretly marrying Sir Walter Raleigh. Death and burial Robert Throckmorton died on 12 February 1581, six days after making a will in which he styled himself as being of Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire, but asked to be buried at Coughton, where an alabaster and marble tomb was accordingly erected to his memory.

The building has a large fa√ßade divided into five modules, decorated by Plateresque reliefs; these include grotesque motifs inspired by Italian Florentine architecture, heraldry symbols, allegories of Justice and Good Government and depictions of mythological or historical characters such as Hercules, Julius Caesar and Charles V.  History  In 1526, following the wedding in Seville of the emperor Carlos V, Holy Roman Emperor, with his cousin Isabella of Portugal, the need was felt to build a building for the city hall that would represent the power and importance of the city at the time. Until then the Council or Cabildo of Seville, like almost all of the civil and ecclesiastical ministries of the city, had its seat in houses of the Corral de los Olmos, today occupied by the Plaza de la Virgen de los Reyes, behind the cathedral. The new building was located on the Plaza de San Francisco, a central commercial square, in front of the Convent of San Francisco and the Real Audiencia de los Grados. Construction of the building began under architect Diego de Ria√±o, who directed the works between 1527 and his death in 1534. He was commissioned to construct a durable stone building, with a fa√ßade facing the Plaza Mayor in front of the convent of San Francisco. He executed what is now the southern section of the City Hall, including the arch that had communicated with the Franciscan monastery and two wings covered with Plateresque reliefs with representations of historical and mythical characters, heraldic symbols and emblems alluding to the founders of the city. Plaza de San Francisco. The reliefs in the upper and right sections were never completed. Plaza Nueva, expanded in the Neoclassical style in 19th century. In the 19th century, after the demolition of the convent of San Francisco, an important expansion, executed by Demetrio de los R√≠os and Balbino Marr√≥n, created a new, Neoclassical fa√ßade oriented to the Plaza Nueva. On the opposite side, facing the Plaza de San Francisco, the north wing of the old building became the south wing of symmetrical tripartite fa√ßade as the building was expanded to the north. Plateresque carving was extended partway across the new fa√ßade in an attempt to match the style of the old building, but it was never completed. Given its status as a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural, it is unlikely to ever be finished due to the restrictions placed on the remodelling of such buildings. The architects also reorganized the interior around two courtyards and a grand staircase.  Building = Exterior  Fa√ßade to the Plaza de San Francisco = The fa√ßade is developed with marked horizontality articulated by a precise architectural composition, distributed in five modules. The structure has two floors, surmounted in places by a third, covered with Plateresque reliefs. These vibrant sculptural carvings include Florentine grotesques; heraldic shields; emblems alluding to justice, harmony and good government; and representations of characters linked to the city, such as Hercules, Julius Caesar (who created the first Cabildo), and the Emperor Charles V (who made Seville one of the capitals of his empire). The carving was carried out by artists from many different places, including Juan de Begines, Diego Guill√©n Ferrant, Hernando de la Teja, Pedro de Pamanes, Pedro de Guadalupe and Toribio de Li√©bana. The arcade that at the time gave way to the convent of San Francisco, and that currently communicates with the Plaza Nueva, was built under the direction of Juan S√°nchez, the successor to Diego de Ria√±o, who supervised the work between 1535 and 1540. = Main fa√ßade to Plaza Nueva = The main fa√ßade facing Plaza Nueva was completed in 1867, executed by Demetrio de los R√≠os and Balbino Marr√≥n.  Interior  Ground floor = On the ground floor are located the following: * Apeadero (access to the building), a rectangular room parallel to the fa√ßade on the Plaza de San Francisco, with hybrid elements between the Gothic and the Plateresque Renaissance. * Antecabildo, with the staircase, which is divided into two sections, one with an almost flat vault and the other covered by a dome, both executed by Juan S√°nchez. * Cabildo bajo or lower chapter house, with a magnificent vault with coffers in which are sculpted images of kings. The hall is covered by a double row of benches; the walls have a frieze with medallions and grotesques. * Chamber of the Court, next to the arch; it does not communicate with the aforementioned sections.

Early years Rojas Tollinchi (birth name: Francisco Antonio Rojas Tollinchi) was one of five siblings born to Pedro Rojas Perez and Flora Maria Tollinchi Battistini in the barrio Algarrobos in Yauco, Puerto Rico. He had to abandon his secondary education at the age of 16, to help his family during his family's financial crisis. He later returned to school and completed his required studies and graduated from high school. In 1934, he married Elena Cummings and together had thirteen children. Rojas Tollinchi worked in various jobs before working for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (AAA), a government agency which controls all the water storage and distribution functions in Puerto Rico. He was the President of the Ponce chapter of the Union of Employees of the AAA and Vice-president of the general Union in the island.\\"JUSTIPRECIACI√ìN DE LA OBRADE FRANCISCO ROJAS TOLLINCHI\\"; by Ada Hilda Mart√≠nez de Alicea; Dept.

Poet From 1962 to 1964, Rojas Tollinchi founded and was the managing director of \\"El Pozo,\\" a monthly newspaper of the Union of Employees of the AAA. Lacking the financial means to publish his work, Rojas Tollinchi used different pen names to publish it in El Pozo. One of his readers, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Men√©ndez, discovered Tollinchi's talent through El Pozo, and provided him with financial aid to publish his work in the \\"Ediciones Yaurinque\\".\\"MLA handbook for writers of research papers (7th ed.)\\" Tollinchi's published works include Fronda Virgen (1940); Cien Sonetos en Cuatro Panfletos (One Hundred Sonnets in Four Pamphlets, 1944); Relicario Sonoro (Shrine of Sound, 1945); Sonetos de la Vida, el Amor y la Muerte (Sonnets of Life, Love and Death, 1955); and Silencio de Dios (Silence of God, 1956). Two of his poems in \\"Relicario Sonoro\\" were dedicated to the heroes of World War II from Yauco. The first Recuerdo Yaucano (Remembrance of a Yaucano) was a homage to Brigadier General Mihiel Gilormini, the Puerto Rican aviator and war hero. The second poem Al Sesenta y Cinco de Infanter√≠a (To the 65th Infantry Regiment) was dedicated to the all-Puerto Rican unit of the same name, whose members included many men from Yauco. Later years and legacy Rojas Tollinchi was general manager of the newspaper La Nueva Reforma (The New Reform). He was also a civic leader and belonged to the League for Struggle for Negro Rights (LSNR). In 1957, he attended the First Congress of Puerto Rican Poets. He was also a collaborator in the publication of the Historical Alum of Yauco. Rojas Tollinchi moved to Ponce in 1959, and lived there until his death in 1965. His hometown, Yauco, honored his memory by naming a street after him. Further reading *American Psychological Association.

Mother of Phocas  Phocas and his family were likely of Thraco-Roman origin.Bury (2009), p. 197 The husband of the elder Domentzia is unknown. She had three known sons: Phocas, ComentiolusMartindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 326 and Domentziolus.

In 607, she married the general Priscus, who served as comes excubitorum, commander of the Excubitors bodyguard. As she was the only known child of the Emperor, the marriage effectively made Priscus an heir presumptive to the throne. Her husband fell into disfavour however when the citizenry of Constantinople began erecting statues in their honour.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 1056 Her marriage took place in the palace of Marina, named after its original owner, a daughter of Arcadius and Aelia Eudoxia. A chariot racing event was arranged to be held in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, in honor of the newlyweds. The leaders of the Blues (V√©netoi) and the Greens (Pr√°sinoi) racing factions (demoi) decided to honor the occasion by erecting statues of the imperial family. Thus they placed images of Phocas, Leontia, Domentzia, and Priscus in the Hippodrome. The images of the reigning imperial couple belonged there by tradition, but the latter two implied that Priscus was the heir or co-emperor of Phocas. Phocas was enraged at the implication and ordered the depictions of his daughter and son-in-law to be destroyed.Bury (2009), p. 202 Phocas further treated the matter as an attempted coup d'√©tat, demanding further investigation of the matter, arresting the demarchs responsible with accusations of treason. While their lives may have been spared due to popular demand, Phocas likely viewed Priscus himself as the culprit, and seems to have started viewing his son-in-law as a potential rival. By alienating Priscus however, Phocas undermined his own hold on the throne. By 608, John of Antioch reports Priscus initiating contact with Heraclius the Elder, the Exarch of Africa, and instigating the revolt that would eventually remove Phocas from power.Bury (2009), pp. 202‚Äì203  References  Sources  * * Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:7th-century Byzantine people Category:6th-century Byzantine women Category:7th-century Byzantine women Category:Daughters of Byzantine emperors ","title":"Domentzia"},{"id":"26901949","text":"American Crossroads is a Super PAC that raises funds from donors to advocate for certain candidates of the Republican Party.

Debate over political activity by Crossroads GPS In the 2010 national election cycle, Crossroads GPS spent millions attacking Democratic Senate candidates, and was the top spender in political advertising in Senate races. In October 2010, Democratic Senator Richard Durbin wrote the IRS asking for it to investigate whether Crossroads GPS had violated its tax status.\\"Durbin Urges IRS to Investigate Spending by Crossroads GPS\\", Senator Richard Durbin press release, Oct 12 2010. Durbin wrote, \\"I write to urge the Internal Revenue Service to examine the purpose and primary activities of several 501 (c)(4) organizations that appear to be in violation of the law,\\" wrote Durbin. \\"[Crossroads GPS] has spent nearly $20 million on television advertising specific to Senate campaigns this year. If this political activity is indeed the primary activity of the organization, it raises serious questions about the organization's compliance with the Internal Revenue Code.\\") Republican senators had previously written to the IRS stating that an investigation into the political activities of tax-exempt groups would amount to a politically motivated tactic that would ‚Äúchill the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.‚ÄùLichtblau, Eric, \\"Republicans See a Political Motive in I.R.S. Audits\\", The New York Times, October 6, 2010. In September 2012, the Sunlight Foundation said that donor anonymity was critical to the fund-raising strategy of Crossroads GPS. Some critics accused non- disclosing political groups like Crossroads GPS of filing for nonprofit status solely to invoke the right to hide their donors. In November 2012, The Washington Post reported that Crossroads GPS failed to register as a non- profit organization in Virginia. The non-profit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed an ethics complaint with the Federal Election Commission and a corresponding letter with the FBI, alleging that Crossroads GPS failed to disclose the identities of contributors who donated $6 million specifically earmarked to fund independent expenditures for Josh Mandel's 2012 Ohio Senate race. Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio dismissed the complaint as \\"frivolous.\\" Activity after the 2010 elections Crossroads GPS demonstrated its interest in participating in non- electoral policy advocacy soon after the 2010 elections when it began running radio advertisements related to tax policy, urging Members of Congress to vote against tax increases.See Politico story which details the $400,000 spent to urge Members of Congress to block tax hikes. An August, 2012 ProPublica analysis of broadcast television political advertising purchases in the 2012 national election cycle, by category, showed that two tax-exempt, non-profit social welfare groups, Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity, combined, outspent all other categories, including political parties, political action committees, super PACs, unions, and trade associations. Other associated organizations American Crossroads shared office space with American Action Network, a group that promotes ‚Äúcenter-right policies.‚Äù\\"American Crossroads Now Targets House Races\\", Politico, September 10, 2010.

The organisation has over 700 members. Many of the members have sustained injuries or illness from working in the mines, and have been declared redundant. And many of the ex-mineworkers have not been compensated for these injuries or paid the pensions they are due. SNEMA is not a political organisation as such, taking a more broad rights-based approach in support of Swaziland's poor, particularly in relation to procuring the unpaid compensation that they believe they are due from the mining industry. In doing this, SNEMA seeks to disseminate its message through mobilisation and civic education. SNEMA is a member of the Swaziland United Democratic Front. SNEMA see the main problems in trying to procure their compensations as being: *Lack of knowledge of rights amongst ex-mine workers. *Lack of access to provident fund money. *Lack of compensation to widows of ex-mine workers. *Lack of care for sick and injured ex-mine workers, many of whom live in the rural areas of Swaziland where medical care facilities are rudimentary at best. *Lack of support from the Swaziland government in accessing medical examinations to prove the illnesses, mainly tuberculosis and silicosis, or in helping addressing the above-mentioned problems. *Lack of support from the South African government and South African mining industry in addressing the above-mentioned problems. *Lack of support from other relevant bodies or organisations in addressing the above-mentioned problems. SNEMA has successfully taken the Swazi Government to court over its unfulfilled promise to provide free primary school education (section 29 (6) of the constitution). The ex-miners argued that the persistent lack of education of their children at primary school level is a complete and unlawful violation of the constitution. The court case followed the refusal of government to respect the ruling of the High Court on the same issue on 16 March 2009, wherein it issued a declaratory judgement pronouncing that the Government of Swaziland has the responsibility to provide free primary school education across all grades in public primary schools in accordance with the Constitution.

Imogen Holst also played an important role in orchestrating the overall work, but she did not write a variation of her own. The variations were written to celebrate the forthcoming coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. (Benjamin Britten also wrote his opera Gloriana in honour of this occasion.) Background At the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July 1952, Benjamin Britten had attended the premiere of La guirlande de Campra, a collaborative work by seven French composers, and this gave him the idea of inviting several English composers to join him in each writing a variation on a theme from the time of the first Queen Elizabeth to honour her modern-day successor.Letters from a life: The selected letters of Benjamin Britten 1913‚Äì1976 Lennox Berkeley, Michael Tippett and William Walton all readily accepted Britten's invitation. Alan Rawsthorne declined outright. Edmund Rubbra initially agreed, but pulled out of the project at the eleventh hour, at which time Arthur Oldham and Humphrey Searle were brought in. The theme was Sellinger's Round or The Beginning of the World, an Irish dance tune, as harmonised for the keyboard by William Byrd, the leading composer from the time of Elizabeth I. It was orchestrated for the occasion by Imogen Holst, but she did not provide a variation of her own. Structure of the work The work was structured as follows: * Theme (anon; harmonised by William Byrd; arranged for string orchestra by Imogen Holst) * Variation 1: Allegro non troppo (Arthur Oldham) * Variation 2: A Lament, Andante espressivo (Michael Tippett) **The variation begins and ends with a transcription of 'Ah Belinda!' from Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, over which a solo violin plays a decorated version of the theme. Tippett's variation later became well known as part of his separate piece, Divertimento on Sellinger's RoundTippett in Focus * Variation 3: Andante (Lennox Berkeley) * Variation 4: Quick and Gay (Benjamin Britten) * Variation 5: Nocturne, Adagio (Humphrey Searle) **Britten considered this the most original of all the variationsClassical Composers.org * Variation 6: Finale, Fuga √† la gigue, Presto giocoso (William Walton) **Walton starts with an inversion of the theme, and concludes with the inversion combined with the original theme.

Among the victims were the President of Poland Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and his wife Maria, the former President of Poland in exile Ryszard Kaczorowski, the chief of the Polish General Staff and other senior Polish military officers, the president of the National Bank of Poland, Polish Government officials, 18 members of the Polish Parliament, senior members of the Polish clergy and relatives of victims of the Katyn massacre. The group was arriving from Warsaw to attend an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of the massacre, which took place not far from Smolensk. The pilots were attempting to land at Smolensk North Airport‚Äîa former military airbase‚Äîin thick fog, with visibility reduced to about . The aircraft descended far below the normal approach path until it struck trees, rolled inverted and crashed into the ground, coming to rest in a wooded area a short distance from the runway. Both the Russian and Polish official investigations found no technical faults with the aircraft, and concluded that the crew failed to conduct the approach in a safe manner in the given weather conditions. The Polish authorities found serious deficiencies in the organization and training of the Air Force unit involved, which was subsequently disbanded. Several high- ranking members of the Polish military resigned, under pressure from politicians and the media. Various conspiracy theories about the crash have since been in circulation, and are promoted by Law and Justice's leaders Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski (twin brother to Polish President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski) and his deputy, Antoni Macierewicz, who claim the crash was a political assassination. Polish and international investigations did not find any evidence supporting this claim. Background=Purpose of the flight The flight's purpose was taking many high-ranking Polish officials to ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, a mass murder of Polish intellectuals, politicians, and military officers by the Soviets during World War II. The site of the massacre is approximately west of Smolensk. The area is fairly remote; Smolensk is the only city nearby and has the only two airports in the area: Smolensk North Airport, where the accident occurred, and Smolensk South Airport. Destination airport Russian servicemen, accompanied by a policeman, twist bulbs into the approach lights of Smolensk North Airport's runway, hours after the crash of the Tu-154 Smolensk North Airport is a former military airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use. At the time of the crash, the airport was not equipped with an ICAO-compliant instrument landing system (ILS), the standard system used in most developed countries. The airport used to have a Russian-made landing system installed, which was decommissioned after civilian operations started. The Polish Tu-154 was modified to use western-style ILS. A non-directional beacon (NDB) was installed at the airport, but such a device is essentially a navigational aid, and can be used only for non-precision approaches, where it can guide the pilot to align with the runway, but offers no vertical guidance on how to descend towards the runway. The airport was equipped also with both a surveillance and landing radar. The lowest approved visibility conditions to land (approach minimums) were cloud base and visibility . The ground visual navigation aids on 10 April 2010 were not effective. According to the Polish report, the radar was unstable and swung within ¬±10%. From the photographic documentation of the Polish committee, it appears that the origin of components of the Smolensk North lighting system was unknown. This was not the Luch-2MU system as the Russians stated. The report from the inspection flight performed on 15 April 2010 stated that the approach lamps, depending on their location and on the altitude of an inbound aircraft, can be shaded by surrounding trees and shrubs when an aircraft is at a distance of 400, 700, and 800 metres from Runway 26. The lamps of the first group (900 m) had their light filters shattered and, of three bulbs installed, only one was serviceable. Aircraft PLF 101, the aircraft involved in the accident, seen at Boryspil International Airport in 2008 The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment of the Polish Air Force (Si≈Çy Powietrzne), tail number 101. Built in 1990 at the Kuybyshev Aviation Plant as msn 90A837, it first flew on 29 June 1990. At the time of the accident, the airframe had accumulated more than 5,150 hours in 4,000 cycles. The service life of the Tu-154M is more than 25 years or 30,000 hours or 15,000 cycles (whichever comes first). All three Soloviev D-30KU-154 engines were within the service limits of 24,000 hours or 11,100 cycles. \\"101\\" was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; the other with a tail number of 102 was a year younger and at the time of the accident it was being overhauled in the Aviakor aviation plant in Samara, Russia. The \\"101\\" aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009, and Alexey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems. The crash happened 138 flight hours after the most recent overhaul. The aircraft used the callsign PLF 101. PLF is the ICAO three-letter designator for the Polish Air Force used to identify the operator of an aircraft by air traffic control.  Crew  The cockpit crew consisted of pilot Captain Arkadiusz Protasiuk, co-pilot Major Robert Grzywna, navigator Lieutenant Artur Ziƒôtek and flight engineer WO2 Andrzej Michalak. Protasiuk had landed at Smolensk three days earlier on 7 April in the same Tu-154; he served as first officer on that flight. Protasiuk had 3,531 flight hours, including 2,906 hours on the Tu-154. Co-pilot Grzywna had 1,909 hours, with 475 of them on the Tu-154. Ziƒôtek had 1,050 hours, only 58 of them on the Tu-154. Michalak had only 329 hours, all on the Tu-154. Flight sequence=Take-off and cruise Map of the origin and destination of the accident flight PLF 101 took off from Warsaw at 9:27 Smolensk time after a delay of 27 minutes. As the aircraft left Warsaw, weather conditions were rapidly deteriorating at Smolensk. A temperature inversion had developed, trapping moisture low in the atmosphere and causing a dense fog to develop. At 9:15 Smolensk time, about an hour and a half before the crash, a Yakovlev Yak-40 jet (flight PLF 031) also belonging to the Polish government and carrying Polish journalists from the President's press pool landed at the airbase without incident, though conditions were rapidly worsening at the time. Shortly thereafter, between 9:20 and 9:39 MSD, a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 (tail number 78817) made two attempts to land, but because of low visibility, it diverted to Vnukovo Airport near Moscow. Upon PLF 101's approach to the base, atmospheric conditions continued to worsen, and the fog continued to thicken, further reducing visibility to . The ground control personnel stated to PLF 101 that there were no conditions for landing. The Captain then requested and was given permission to conduct a \\"trial\\" approach. The controllers instructed the captain as to the landing minimum of , to which the captain replied, \\"Yes, sir!\\" Stress and workload factors Meanwhile, the situation in the cockpit was one of very high stress. As the weather continued to worsen, the crew became increasingly aware of the extreme difficulty they would encounter in landing at Smolensk. The crew may have feared a negative reaction from their passengers should they have to divert to an alternative airfield. The protocol director was present in the cockpit from time to time, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force was present in the cockpit for the final approach phase of the flight, including the crash itself. At one point, the navigator is heard on the CVR saying \\"He'll go crazy\\", a possible reference to the President of Poland, had the crew chosen to divert. There may also have been some friction between the Air Force Commander and the captain, caused by an absence of the latter from condition training. The captain and first officer's decision making may have also been affected by knowledge of a 2008 flight when the President of Poland ordered a change in destination right before departure and again while airborne. The captain and first officer had been the first officer and navigator, respectively, on that flight. Lacking charts or a flight plan for the new destination, the captain of that flight had decided he could not bring the aircraft to the new destination safely. Disobeying the President and a high-ranking Polish Air Force commander on board, the captain flew on to the originally planned destination. The Polish prosecutor's office would later clear that captain of any wrongdoing in relation to that flight, and he was even awarded a silver medal of merit for national defense. However, in the final report issued by MAK (The Interstate Aviation Committee; Russian: –ú–µ–∂–≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç, –ú–ê–ö) ‚Äì a supervising body overseeing the use and management of civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), it was stated he had not been assigned to fly the President since, though Polish sources note he flew the President to New York in September 2008, despite objections from the President. The captain involved in the 2008 incident flew the Polish Prime Minister to Smolensk on 7 April without the President on board, but he was removed from the crew of the 10 April flight which carried the President. Knowledge of the 2008 incident and its repercussions may have weighed on the crew of PLF 101, potentially placing additional pressure on them to complete their flight to the original destination. Complicating the situation was the increased workload on the captain. Normally, one pilot flies the airplane while another crew member handles radio communications. On PLF 101, the responsibility for communication usually rests with the navigator. At Smolensk however the situation was different. As the airport is not usually open for international flights and is not ICAO certified, the air traffic controllers were not required to be fluent in English, the ICAO standard language for ATC communication. As such, all communication between Smolensk ATC and PLF 101 was carried out in Russian. Russian law requires international flights landing at military airports to have a Russian \\"Leaderman\\" (navigator; Russian lidirovshik) on board the flight, who is then responsible for all ATC communication, which is done in Russian. In the middle of March, as part of their request for permission to conduct the flight, Poland asked for \\"Leaderman\\" services and the latest airport data for Smolensk. At the end of March, after apparently receiving no reply to their first request, Poland tendered a second request for permission to fly, but did not request \\"Leaderman\\" services. As a spokesperson for the Air Force Command said: \\"The Russian side has not confirmed readiness to secure the flight leader\\". According to the Final Report, Russia did offer \\"Leaderman\\" services, but Poland refused, stating their crew had satisfactory knowledge of Russian and could conduct the flight without the Leaderman. In reality, the captain was the only member of the crew who could speak adequate Russian. Therefore, upon being handed off (transferred) to Smolensk ATC, the captain took over communication duties from the navigator. In a normal situation, this would dictate that the first officer be the pilot actually flying the airplane, but as the weather was bad the captain, as the most experienced member of the crew, elected to fly the airplane as well. Therefore, the captain was performing two tasks simultaneously which are usually split up, increasing his workload and requiring him to divide his attention. Approach PLF 101 landing at Prague Airport less than two days before the accident Under these stresses, the crew continued their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were tuned to the two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the autopilot was set up to use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, \\"Well, generally it's absolute shit here,\\" and that, \\"(we) were lucky to land at the last moment.\\" The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was , but told PLF 101, \\"you might try...(to make an approach).\\" The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to PLF 101 concerning their distance from the runway and whether or not they were on the glidepath. The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not. The Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) fired its first audible warning \\"terrain ahead!\\" at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, was not in the system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the airplane was approaching an airport. Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by ; as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the additional effect of silencing the warning. The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic pressure altimeters continued to read correctly. As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to , twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the autothrottles commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately higher than specified. Approaching , the navigator began calling out the radar altimeter's reading. This is not standard practice for a non-precision approach, as the radar altimeter does not take into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the pressure altimeter, which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level. Warning signs At , the engines were still at idle power. Power settings for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as \\"N1\\" and \\"N2\\". N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a jet engine on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured as a percentage of maximum N1 or N2 rpm. Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions. The Tu-154 manual indicates that a go-around must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2. This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to \\"spool up\\" in order to produce more thrust. At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to \\"spool up\\" to full power. On PLF 101, the N2 values were not recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32‚Äì33% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51‚Äì52% N1 for the given conditions. As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a go-around at this point, even though they were still above Decision Height (DH). However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not. At , the \\"terrain ahead!\\" warning again sounded on the flight deck. The crew continued the descent. According to MAK's report, at (Decision Height) there was no \\"landing\\" or \\"go-around\\" call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, take control of the airplane, and initiate a go-around. Poland suggests that at this point the captain said \\"Go around\\", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying \\"go around\\". (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued. One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert \\"PULL UP\\" activated and continued to sound for the remainder of the flight. \\"PULL UP\\" only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when \\"PULL UP\\" sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops. However, the crew continued the descent. In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the \\"PULL UP\\" warning might not have sounded at this point. There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as \\"terrain inhibit\\" mode; however, the crew did not utilize it. Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a \\"SINK RATE\\" warning followed by a \\"PULL UP\\" warning. This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2¬∞10'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.) In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly, or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around. (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, \\"landing additionally, 120, 3 m\\"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006. For the next several seconds, the crew continued to call out \\"100 meters\\" as read from the radar altimeter. The aircraft was flying into a valley at this time and actually descended by . The crew began calling out radar altitude every . At radar altitude (where the crew had set their radar altitude bugs), the First Officer called out \\"Go around\\" (this is the \\"confirmation\\" go around call referred to in the Polish comment above). Due to the terrain in the area, the aircraft was actually only above runway level at the time. Simultaneously to this callout, the FDR recorded a brief pull on the control column, likely done by the first officer, as he instinctively started the go-around sequence of actions. According to the investigation, this attempt at a go-around was completely overridden by the auto-pilot, which was still active, and, in any event, it was not completed (protocol requires that the correct sequence of operations during a go-around attempt involves increasing thrust to takeoff mode and disengaging the autopilot, neither action was done at the time). Flight simulator testing by the investigation concluded that had the first officer completed a go-around at this point, the crash would likely have been avoided despite the violation of minimums and the excessive rate of descent. The investigation found that this was the last moment at which a go-around could have been successful. Point of no return As the crew called out \\"50 meters\\", the controller instructed \\"level 101\\", telling the aircraft to terminate descent. At , another controller instructed \\"Check altitude, level.\\" Simultaneously with this final call, the control column was pulled full aft, commanding max pitch up from the aircraft, and the throttles were moved within one second from their flight idle positions to maximum power. The aircraft, due to the valley terrain, was actually below the runway at this time. The Russian investigation surmised that at this moment the flight crew saw the trees through the fog, and instinctively reacted in an attempt to escape their grave predicament. The crew did not disengage the autopilot, but the action of commanding maximum pitch up on the control column overpowered it, causing the pitch channel to disengage. The control column briefly moved to neutral at this point, then moved full aft and remained there for the duration of the flight. According to the Polish report, the command \\"level\\" ordering a change to horizontal flight was issued at a time when the aircraft was at an altitude of about above airfield level. Two seconds before the \\"level\\" command, the aircraft commander made the decision to go around. According to the Polish committee's findings, the command to level should have been issued 10 seconds sooner, when the aircraft was well below the glide path. Soon after, the aircraft began hitting trees. One, a large birch with a trunk wide, ripped off about of the left wing, including the left aileron. The resulting asymmetrical lift caused an uncommanded roll to the left. Within 5 seconds, the aircraft was inverted, hitting the ground with the left wing, followed very shortly after by the nose. The nose impact resulted in forces exceeding 100g, which killed everyone on board instantly. Even without the birch tree and subsequent roll, the excessive angle of attack would have led to an aerodynamic stall approximately two seconds after impact with that tree, which would also have led to a fatal accident. According to the Polish report, safety areas around every aerodrome are mandated by international regulations (including Polish and Russian law) to prevent situations where aircraft or aerodrome operation could be compromised by obstacles in the immediate vicinity. A thorough analysis of terrain reveals that obstacles were present in the safety area, with many trees exceeding the permitted height limit (mostly about ). After the nose hit, the aircraft was violently torn apart by impact forces. The wreckage came to rest upside-down about before the runway threshold and slightly left of its centreline. The largest pieces left were the wing roots (the strongest part of an airplane), the wingtips and the tail section. The tail section came to rest backwards, relative to the direction of flight. A small post-impact fire ensued, but was quickly brought under control by the emergency services and extinguished 18 minutes later. The Governor of Smolensk Oblast, Sergey Antufyev, confirmed that there were no survivors of the crash. Pictures from the scene showed parts of the aircraft charred and strewn through a wooded area. The Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, said that the bodies of those killed in the crash would be brought to Moscow for identification. Kaczy≈Ñski's body was identified in Smolensk and was flown directly to Warsaw on the afternoon of 11 April. Initial investigation As the accident occurred on Russian soil, Russia was tasked by ICAO procedure with primary responsibility for investigation, which it carried out with international cooperation. Poland also set up its own committee to investigate the crash, and prosecutors in both countries began criminal investigations. Interstate Aviation Committee In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) () oversees the use and management of civil aviation. The committee's Air Accident Investigation Commission is responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents occurring in commonwealth member nations. The committee is headquartered in Moscow, Russia. Immediate actions Within hours of the crash, the President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, announced the establishment of a special commission for the investigation of the accident. The commission was to be supervised by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. An Investigation Committee of the Prosecutor General of Russia started a criminal case in accordance with a \\"violation of the safety rules\\" of the Russian Criminal Code. Flight recorders Two flight recorders, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR), were recovered undamaged from the crash site during the afternoon/early evening of 10 April, as was confirmed by Sergey Shoygu, the Russian Minister of Emergency Situations. That evening, it was reported that the CVR recordings confirmed the crew attempted to land against the advice of air traffic controllers. A third flight recorder, a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) designed for maintenance diagnostics, was found on 12 April. The two Flight Management System (FMS) units were also recovered. The investigation was able to obtain information from the electronic memories of the Quick Access Recorder and one of the FMS units, despite the fact that they were not designed to withstand a crash. Since the FMS units are linked together, being able to read the memory of one meant the investigation was able to determine the actions performed by both units. It would later be discovered that the FDR was partially defective and had occasional gaps in its data, but as the QAR managed to survive the crash, by synchronizing the data from the two units, a complete picture of flight data emerged. On the day after the crash, investigators said they had reviewed the flight recorders, and confirmed that there were no technical problems with the Soviet-built aeroplane, ruling out initial theories that the 20-year-old aircraft was at fault. Alexei Gusev, general director of the Aviakor factory, said that the aircraft's three engines had been repaired and technicians had upgraded the plane's avionics at a recent overhaul the previous year. He said that there were no doubts about the plane's airworthiness. Search for human remains Ewa Kopacz, former Polish Minister of Health, claimed before the Sejm that after the crash, ground was dug to a depth of one metre, and even if a tiny piece of human flesh was found, it was genetically tested. However, in the transcript released online by the Sejm, the meaning of her speech was changed: that when a small piece of flesh was found, the ground was dug to a depth of one metre. Moreover, in September 2010, one of the Polish pilgrims to Smolensk found a jaw with teeth and two other bones. Russian cooperation Russia offered full cooperation to Polish prosecutors during the investigation. According to the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) Polish investigators in Russia have been given access to all procedures of Russian investigators. However, Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, said that \\"Poland does not have a lot of things that (we) would like to have\\" and as an example gives lack of documentation of Smolensk airport and regulations about Air Control. Polish investigators do not have the authority to conduct investigative actions by themselves, but they participated on equal terms with their Russian counterparts in the interviews with people involved and other parts of the investigation. Polish officials were to secure all Polish state documents found in the wreckage, as well as electronic devices (portable computers and mobile telephones) belonging to government officials and military officers. In turn Russian investigators received from Poland materials secured after the crash, including those about the technical state of the aircraft and fitness of the pilot. The Polish investigation results were to be based in part on Russian findings, but they are not bound by the results of the Russian investigation. Preliminary results of the investigations were to be released on the Thursday after the crash (including the cockpit voice recordings), but this was postponed until after the weekend when the funeral of the Presidential couple was to take place, then postponed indefinitely until the full analysis was completed. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, both of Soviet design, were analyzed in Russia with the participation of Polish experts. The Quick Access Recorder, designed and produced in Poland, was sent to Poland and analysed there, with the participation of Russian experts. The Flight Management System units, manufactured in the United States, were analyzed there with the participation of the FAA, NTSB, Polish experts, and Russian experts. Airport and pilot communication The airport's traffic control communicated with the pilots in Russian, and one of the controllers claimed the Polish crew had problems communicating in this language. However, according to Tomasz Pietrzak, the former commander of the Polish 36th Special Aviation Regiment, the captain of PLF 101 was fluent in Russian and English. The Captain had landed in Smolensk three days before the crash, when he was part of the crew bringing Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to the 7 April ceremony, and at the time no communication problems with ground control were reported. However, while the captain knew Russian, the rest of the crew did not, in particular the navigator whose task it is to communicate with the ground, thus placing an additional workload on the captain. Previous flights to Smolensk had been accompanied by a Russian navigator, but none was provided for the April 2010 flights, with differing reasons for this given by Polish and Russian sides. The final accident report would later conclude that the captain's knowledge of Russian was \\"satisfactory.\\" The airport, which normally should have been closed due to the severe conditions, was not declared closed as its management feared that this could cause a diplomatic incident. According to the news agency Interfax, the pilot was told that Smolensk North Airport was enveloped in thick fog and strongly advised against landing, but still he decided to continue with the original flight plan and attempt a landing. According to an interview with a flight controller Pavel Plusnin it was suggested to the pilot that he land at an alternative airfield in Moscow or Minsk. According to Plusnin, the pilot said, that he would attempt one approach, and if landing was not possible, he would then divert to another airfield. There was some concern in the press as to whether or not Russian military ATC had the authority to issue military orders to PLF 101, as the aircraft was a military flight. Under Russian law, military flights are under the control of Russian military ATC, and permission or denial for approach and landing must be given by the controller prior to these actions being undertaken by a flight crew. The final accident report determined that, as a foreign military aircraft, Russian controllers did not have the authority to issue military orders to PLF 101, and this had been communicated to the ATC personnel who handled the flight. The \\"trial\\" approach was conducted with the understanding by ATC that all risk for such an approach was to be undertaken by PLF 101 and not ATC. Theft from victims On 6 June 2010, it was reported that payments worth ‚Ç¨1,400 had been made from a credit card found on the body of historian Andrzej Przewo≈∫nik, one of the victims of the crash. Credit cards belonging to the politician Aleksandra Natalli-≈öwiat were also missing, but not used in transactions. On 8 June 2010, ITAR-TASS reported that four soldiers of Unit 06755 had been charged in connection with the theft, after being found in possession of three credit cards used to withdraw a total of 60,345 rubles. A Polish spokesperson said that the first withdrawals using the cards had been made around two hours after the crash. The Polish government admitted that the Russian soldiers involved in the theft were probably conscripts, and that earlier reports blaming members of Russia's OMON forces for the theft had been a mistake. Initial reports An initial report by CIS' Interstate Aviation Committee () revealed that all three engines were operating normally, and that there was no fire or explosion before the aircraft crashed. According to the newspaper Dziennik, Polish flight recorder ATM-QAR registered that precisely at 8:41:02.5 (Polish time) the tail of the aircraft separated. All systems of Tu-154 stopped working at 8:41:04. Fuel temperature was below . Engines when the aircraft was above the road were at 60% of their nominal power (Tu-154 needs about 10 seconds to get 100% of power from engines). They also determined that the aircraft was lower than it should have been. The discrepancy among the time of the crash registered by MARS flight recorders (10:41:05.4), ATM-QAR recorder (10:41:04), and when electricity lines were cut by the crashing aircraft a second or two before the final crash (10:39:35) was never explained. On 19 May 2010, the preliminary report of the investigation into the crash was published. Alexei Morozov, the head of the technical commission of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, stated that the Tupolev Tu-154M had no mechanical faults, and that an air traffic control official at Smolensk North Airport had \\"warned twice that visibility was 400 metres (1,312ft) and that were no conditions for landing\\". The investigation ruled out a terrorist attack, explosion or fire on board the aircraft as the cause of the crash. It was also reported that the voices of two non-crew members were heard in the cockpit during the period leading up to the crash. One of the voices was identified by sources as the Polish Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General Andrzej B≈Çasik. However, according to the findings of the Polish prosecutor's office in January 2013, General B≈Çasik had not stayed in the cockpit and was a regular passenger. The other voice was later identified as the Director of Protocol. According to the Interstate Aviation Committee report from 19 May 2010, the aircraft first hit an tree approximately from the runway. The aircraft was also off by from the extended middle line of the runway. The TAWS alarm \\"Pull up!\\" was first sounded at altitude and then repeated several times before the crash. It was first sounded 18 seconds before hitting the tree and the crew attempted to abort landing 13 seconds later. Due to geographical relief the aircraft was actually below the runway at the time of the first impact. On 26 May 2010, it was reported that pilot error had been identified as the reason for the crash. Edmund Klich, the head of the Polish investigative commission, stated in an interview \\"Pretty much everything is clear right now and nearly all evidence has been gathered\\". \\"The pilots ignored the plane's automatic warnings and attempted an incredibly risky landing,\\" Klich said. According to the report, the crew of the Tupolev Tu-154M failed to respond for 13 seconds when the plane's \\"terrain approaching\\" alarm warned that the aircraft was less than from the ground. The aircraft attempted to pull up after hitting a birch tree, but part of the left wing had been sheared off in the impact. The aircraft then went into a roll before landing on its back and disintegrating five seconds later. Edmund Klich declined to speculate on whether the pilot had been placed under pressure to land, commenting, \\"Psychologists will have to assess the stress levels the pilots were subjected to.\\" On 1 June 2010, Poland's Interior Ministry published a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder of the crashed Tu-154M. The transcript confirmed earlier reports that the aircraft had attempted to land in bad weather against the advice of air traffic control and the plane's terrain awareness warning system. At one point in the recording, Mariusz Kazana, the Director of Diplomatic Protocol in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, enters the cockpit and was told by the pilot \\"Sir, the fog is increasing. At the moment, under these conditions that we have now, we will not manage to land\\" to which Kazana replies \\"Well, then we have a problem.\\" Expert commentators have noted that the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, was referring to the radar altimeter (which gives height above ground) rather than the pressure altimeter (which would provide the height relative to the level of the runway). Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened. The Russian report was published on 12 January 2011, and the Polish report was published on 29 July 2011. Both reports placed the majority of the blame for the accident on the pilots for descending too low without being able to see the ground. The Polish report also placed harsh criticism on the organization of Poland's special aviation regiment and its leaders, as well as finding deficiencies in the performance of the Russian air traffic controllers and in the airport's lighting and approach area. In Polish discourse, there remained wider questions and unease about the potential causes of the crash. This prompted a Warsaw court and a separate military investigation. Some of the unease subsequently fueled conspiracy theories revolving around aspects of the investigation, such as Russia's decision not to return the Polish plane wreckage to Poland. In the aftermath of the accident, Russia published a large number of restricted documents on the Katyn massacre, and declassified and published many more. Additionally, the Russian State Duma issued a declaration blaming Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and other leaders for ordering the Katyn massacre. Subsequent Katyn memorials have been joint Russian/Polish affairs attended by the leaders of both countries. Russian final accident report The MAK completed their investigation on 20 October 2010. A copy of the report was sent to the Polish authorities, who had 60 days to comment, after which the report was published on 12 January 2011. After the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) report's publication, Poland stated that it was created in violation of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation because some requested documents or evidences were not provided by Russia and, according to a Polish lawyer, because Polish comments to the final report were not agreed to nor fully applied. The final report noticed that the captain's electronic altimeter was set higher than the actual position. This change was made after the aircraft began its final approach and soon after the first TAWS warning sounded. All other altimeters on board were set correctly. The investigation also determined that the controller's radar screen was not calibrated correctly and showed the airplane as being closer to the runway than it actually was. Additionally, his radio calls to the crew regarding their distance to the runway were given in advance by an average of . As part of their investigation, MAK conducted an experiment in a Tu-154M simulator to determine how late the crew could have gone around. \\"The experiment confirmed that during approaches in conditions similar to the flight conditions of the T-154M ... with a similar flight profile with vertical speed of descent of 7‚Äì8 m/s ... the aircraft characteristics guaranteed safe go around from the height of 40 m (without taking into consideration the possible obstacles and terrain along the flight path).\\" Taking into consideration the terrain at Smolensk, the investigation determined the last moment a go-around maneuver would have been successful was coincident with the first officer calling \\"Go around\\" and briefly pulling the control column at . Polish comments on the draft of the final report On the same day that the final report was published by MAK, Poland published its comments on the draft of the final report sent to MAK before. Poland stated that their comments were not taken into consideration. MAK did not include them in the report, but published this document on its website among other appendixes. Poland also published a final version of MAK report with changes performed by MAK in reaction for Polish comments highlighted (red color means changes of text, blue means text addition). The main points of Polish comments are: * A list of documents, evidence, and other information requested by Poland but not received from the Russian side (First table in document \\"Lista Wystapien Strony Polskiej o Dokumentacje\\", List of requests from Poland about documentation. Entry \\"Nie otrzymano\\" means \\"Not received\\"). Sample of them: Standards of certification for usage of military airports on the Russian Federation territory, Instructions for flights in Smolensk area. * Poland notes that, according to international agreement between Poland and Russia from 1993, PLF 101 was classified in Poland as a military plane and should be treated as performing a military operation also on the territory of the Russian Federation, especially in non-classified airspace and during approaching a military airport without ICAO certification. During military operations the ATC can give orders to the crew about landing decisions as opposed to civilian flights where the ATC only gives recommendations, but where the final decision about landing is the pilots' responsibility. * Information that result of analysis of CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), performed by Polish Commission for the Investigation of National Aviation Accidents, says that first officer gives command \\"go around\\" at 100 m altitude This analysis has been ignored by MAK's final report. * Request for document confirmation that Commander of the Landing Zone was allowed to work in bad weather conditions. Documents confirm only admission for work at day and night in normal weather conditions. Poland notices also that Commander of the Landing Zone had never before worked at Smolensk and in last 12 months performed this function only 7 times. All that information is in his testimony. There is no documentation which certificate Commander of the Landing Zone on Smolensk airport which is required by Russian Law. * Polish position that ATC gives wrong information for PLF 101 (\\"on course, on glide slope\\") and \\"Level 101\\" was given too late. According to Final Report at this moment plane was up to above runway level and before runway begins. * Differences in approach card described by Final Report and approach card received by Poland before 10 April 2010 with information that Russia sent documents without information about reference system of coordinates in document. Poland assumed that coordinates are expressed using WGS-84 which is worldwide standard. Current standard for reference system used in Russia (according to its own law regulation) is PZ-90 which differ from WGS-84 by less than in any given direction. * Doubts about Smolensk compliance with Russian regulations because there were trees and other obstacles in an area 300 to 900 m long before the runway. The heights of these obstacles are 15m higher than allowed (according to both Russian and ICAO regulations). After the accident, trees in this area were cut. The structure of flight PLF 101 began to be destroyed in that area. * Polish explanation that there is no requirement in Military aviation for aircraft to have insurance (PLF 101 was owned and maintained by the Polish Military) and even civil regulations allows other financial protections besides insurance. In the case of PLF 101, the Polish National Treasury was financially responsible for the aircraft. * Polish explanation that, according to Polish law, Certificate of Airworthiness is required for civilian planes and is not obligatory for military machines ‚Äî instead of this certificate, Polish military planes have to accomplish conditions regulated by \\"Instrukcja s≈Çu≈ºby in≈ºynieryjno-lotniczej Lotnictwa Si≈Ç Zbrojnych RP\\" (Instruction for engineering and aviation service of Aviation Forces in Republic of Poland). Poland also provides list of documents that confirm plane compliance with that document. * Information that Polish side had not received documentation of control flight over Smolensk nor documentation of RSP-6m2 radar system used in ATC. * Doubts about reliability of protocol after control flight which confirmed that light system (LUCZ-2MU) is working properly on Smolensk when MAK Final Report says it did not. Polish specialists were not allowed to be present during control flight. * Doubts about proper work of radar display according to protocol from control flight. * Request for source data to marker location on radar display described in Final Report. Information provided to Poland says that camera recorder in ATC was corrupted and there is no information about any other source data. * Request for information about 13 recorders mounted in ATC, and data recorded (even corrupted) for analysis. MAK states that camera, voice recorders and photo laboratory not worked properly and a lot of information was not saved. * Information that FCOM of Tu-154M in fact does not prescribe using the autopilot during non-precision approach, however this is also not forbidden. * Expressed lack of any document that confirms PLF 101's status under Russian law. * Request for source data and method of calculation of PLF 101's weight. Poland says that original documentation about loading and weight measure was destroyed. * Allegations that documents certifying the medical examination of air controllers had manual corrections and are inconsistent with their testimonies where they confirmed that medical point was closed on 10 April 2010. * Correction of number of specialists‚Äîwith list of their certifications‚Äîthat performed technical support on PLF 101 Polish publication of ATC tapes At an 18 January 2011 press conference, the Polish investigation made public the information contained in ATC recordings, and their analysis of such. They concluded that the \\"on course, on glide path\\" calls given to the pilots were made when the aircraft was actually off course, and furthermore the \\"Level!\\" call was given 11 seconds too late. MAK publication of ATC tapes In response to the Polish claims of publicity MAK published transcripts of ATC recordings on its website. The announcement made on MAK website states that the transcripts are based on a copy of recordings identical to the one which was given to the Polish side during the investigation. The transcripts include: \\"Open microphone\\", phone calls and radio transmissions. The transcripts show that communication between the ATC and PLF101 was done mostly in Russian with only a few English phrases. Causes=MAK report The MAK report found the \\"immediate cause\\" of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport despite being warned multiple times of the poor weather conditions at Smolensk. Another immediate cause was the descent below minimums without visual contact with the ground as well as ignoring numerous TAWS warnings. This led to controlled flight into terrain. Additionally, the MAK report found an \\"immediate cause\\" of the accident was the presence in the cockpit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force, which placed extreme stress and \\"psychological pressure\\" on the Captain to \\"continue descent in conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means.\\" A \\"contributing factor\\" to the accident was a long discussion with the Protocol director and the crew of the Yak-40 regarding the actual weather and the impossibility of landing at Smolensk in such weather conditions. The report found this discussion caused the Captain to experience \\"clash of motives.\\" On one hand he knew that landing in the reported weather conditions was unsafe. On the other hand, he faced strong motivation to land at Smolensk anyway. He expected a strong negative reaction from the President if he chose to divert the airplane and land at an alternate airport. Other \\"contributing factors\\" were a lack of compliance with standard operating procedures, a lack of crew resource management, and a significant gap in bad weather flights by the PIC (he had not flown in weather conditions similar to Smolensk that day in four months). Additional \\"contributing factors\\" were the Navigator calling out radar altitudes without considering the uneven terrain in the area, utilization of the autopilot and autothrottles much lower than minimum descent altitude which did not comply with the Flight Crew Operations Manual for the Tu-154, and the late start of the final descent which caused the crew to maintain a higher than normal vertical speed. A \\"systemic cause\\" of the accident were \\"significant shortcomings in the organization of flight operations, flight crew preparation and arrangement of the VIP flight in the special air regiment.\\" Official Polish government report The Polish Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents (KBWLLP) published its report on 29 July 2011, also available in English and Russian. While the report stated that pilot error was the main cause of the accident, with the crew lacking adequate training in operating in adverse weather conditions, it differed from the Russian report in several aspects. Chief among these differences was a conclusion that the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and furthermore the crew did not want to land and after reaching 100m altitude (measured by radio altimeter) and had decided to go around using the autopilot. However, it was impossible for the autopilot installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a non-precision approach. The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash. Another major difference was a conclusion that Russian air traffic control played a part in the accident by passing incorrect information to the crew regarding the plane's position. ATC gave distance callouts on average in advance, and told the aircraft it was on the correct glidepath when it actually was not. Furthermore, the controllers gave the \\"Level 101\\" command ten seconds after the aircraft passed the altitude where such call was supposed to be given. The Polish report also found three deficiencies regarding the Smolensk airport which contributed to the crash. One was a large number of obstacles (mostly tall trees) in the area before the runway which should have been removed to keep the protected approach airspace clear of obstructions. The second deficiency was with the approach lighting system, which was charted incorrectly and not well maintained. Many bulbs were burned out, several others were missing their lenses, and others were obscured by shrubbery. The third concern was with the airport information received by Poland, which contained incorrect information. In addition to the lighting system not being depicted correctly, the airport's location was charted approximately to the North of its actual position. Due to numerous accusations raised by Law and Justice opposition party who rejected the official report's conclusions, a new commission was created in 2013, headed by Maciej Lasek. Its task was to publish and explain all the technical evidence used in the official report. Lasek commission's produced over a hundred very detailed technical reports, maps, transcripts, photos and videos which were originally published on www.faktysmolensk.gov.pl website. Shortly after the 2015 Polish parliamentary elections the website was shut down and all documents removed by the new government, but were subsequently restored on an independent mirror. Cause of accident according to Polish report: : The immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as a delayed execution of the go-around procedure. Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact. Circumstances contributing to the accident: # Failure to monitor altitude by means of a pressure altimeter during a non-precision approach; # failure by the crew to respond to the PULL UP warning generated by the TAWS; # attempt to execute the go-around maneuver under the control of ABSU (automatic go-around); # Approach Control confirming to the crew the correct position of the airplane in relation to the RWY threshold, glide slope, and course which might have affirmed the crew's belief that the approach was proceeding correctly although the airplane was actually outside the permissible deviation margin; # failure by LZC to inform the crew about descending below the glide slope and delayed issuance of the level-out command; # incorrect training of the Tu-154M flight crews in the 36 Regiment. Conducive circumstances: # incorrect coordination of the crew's work, which placed an excessive burden on the aircraft commander in the final phase of the flight; # insufficient flight preparation of the crew; # the crew's insufficient knowledge of the airplane's systems and their limitations; # inadequate cross-monitoring among the crew members and failure to respond to the mistakes committed; # crew composition inadequate for the task; # ineffective immediate supervision of the 36 Regiment's flight training process by the Air Force Command; # failure by the 36 Regiment to develop procedures governing the crew's actions in the event of: #* failure to meet the established approach criteria; #* using radio altimeter for establishing alarm altitude values for various types of approach; #* distribution of duties in a multi-crew flight. # sporadic performance of flight support duties by LZC over the last 12 months, in particular under difficult WC, and lack of practical experience as LZC at the SMOLENSK NORTH airfield. Notable passengers In addition to Kaczy≈Ñski and his wife Maria, and Ryszard Kaczorowski, the former last President of Poland in exile, on board were the military chiefs of staff (army, air force, navy), the national bank governor, a deputy foreign minister, head army chaplains of the Catholic and Orthodox churches, head of the National Security Bureau, three deputy parliament speakers, Olympic Committee head, the civil rights commissioner Janusz Kochanowski, trade union activist Anna Walentynowicz, and at least two presidential aides and widely known national lawmakers (including core members of the Law and Justice party). Political aftermath In accordance with the Polish Constitution, on the President's death his duties were taken on by the Marshal of the Sejm (speaker of the lower house of the parliament)‚Äîat the time Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski, who thus became Acting President of Poland. Within two weeks he was obliged to announce the date of the popular presidential election, to be held within a further 60 days on a weekend. Kaczy≈Ñski was up for re-election in late September or early October, before the end of his first five-year term. Despite the deaths of the president and numerous officials, the crash was not expected to impair the functions of the Polish government, since no cabinet ministers were aboard the plane. The Polish Armed Forces were dealt a severe blow, however, since all of their senior commanding officers were killed; their duties were automatically taken over by respective deputy commanders, following standard contingency plans for such a situation. The commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre was split up because of the political conflict between the liberal-conservative government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and national-conservative President Kaczy≈Ñski. On 7 April, Tusk, along with government officials and members of his Civic Platform party, went to Katyn on invitation from the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin. The official commemoration, organised by Polish Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites, was scheduled on 10 April. Nevertheless, both ruling coalition and opposition were represented on the plane, with six and nine members of the Sejm, as well as one and two from the Senate, respectively, some of them well known in Poland. Many passengers were actively opposed to Tusk's policies, including: * President Kaczy≈Ñski himself, * President of the National Bank of Poland, S≈Çawomir Skrzypek, * Chief of the Institute of National Remembrance, Janusz Kurtyka, * Polish Ombudsman Janusz Kochanowski, * Jerzy Szmajdzi≈Ñski, the left-wing candidate in the upcoming presidential election. The President of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers and former CIA analyst, S. Eugene Poteat, has written that political violence should not be ruled out under the circumstances of the aircraft crash. The Marshal of the Sejm, Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski, had previously been announced as the Civic Platform's candidate in the presidential election. He suggested that the date of the elections should be decided by the parliamentary opposition, with him acting merely to guarantee that the Constitution is respected. On 17 April, one week after the crash, a memorial service, including a two-minute silence, was held to honour the victims of the crash. It was reported that over 100,000 mourners attended the event, held in Pi≈Çsudski Square; however, up to 1.5 million had been expected. State funeral The funeral service for the presidential couple took place in Saint Mary's Basilica in Krak√≥w on 18 April. The couple were buried in a crypt below Wawel Cathedral, a place traditionally reserved for people considered to be heroes of Polish history. Presidential election The first round of the election to elect President Kaczy≈Ñski's successor was held on 20 June 2010. Since no candidate obtained an absolute majority, a run-off was held on 4 July 2010, between the two highest-polling candidates: the acting president Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski, and the late president's brother Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski. While commentators noted that PiS gained some sympathy votes, it was not seen as a decisive factor in the election. In the second round of the election, Komorowski defeated Kaczy≈Ñski with 53% of the vote. VIP flight reorganisation Following the publication of the Polish Accident report, the 36th Special Aviation Regiment which operated the flight was disbanded, and 13 Polish military officers were dismissed. Most Polish officials were instructed to fly on regular civilian flights. Two Embraer 170s were retained for government VIPs, but were flown by civilian pilots and operated by LOT Polish Airlines. The remaining aircraft from the regiment, including the surviving Tu-154, were sold. Reactions=Poland Crowds on the Royal Route, Warsaw Flowers and candles in front of Lublin town hall In Poland, the public reacted with shock and grief to the disaster. Almost immediately after the news broke, tens of thousands of Poles assembled at the Presidential Palace to lay tributes, including flowers, wreaths, and candles. A week of national mourning was declared in Poland. Poles around the world mourned Kaczy≈Ñski and set up shrines in the week that followed. Many wept openly. Flags flew at half mast in Poland. Sports fixtures, including women's U-17 UEFA Championship elite qualifying phase game Poland versus Republic of Ireland in Ukraine, were postponed. Concerts were cancelled. On 11 April, Kaczy≈Ñski's body was flown to Warsaw on a military plane; tens of thousands of Poles gathered at both the airport tarmac and the streets of the city to pay their respects to the late president as his casket was driven by hearse to the Presidential Palace. Afterwards, the casket was laid in state at the Palace. The casket remained there throughout the week, until Kaczynski and his wife were laid to rest at the Wawel Cathedral a full week after the crash, on 18 April. On 15 April, Polish scouts put a wooden cross in front of the Presidential Palace in Warsaw, at Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie, to commemorate the victims of the crash. The establishing of the cross provoked controversy in Poland, mainly related to questions concerning the separation of church and state. Polish Catholics wanted the cross to permanently remain in front of the palace, while others, including Komorowski, wanted it moved to St. Anne's Church. After a summer of protests over the cross, it was transferred to the church on 16 September. A public noon commemoration ceremony in Warsaw's Pi≈Çsudski Square was attended by more than 100,000 people on 17 April. Sirens sounded and bells tolled around the country. A three-gun salute was fired. People waved the flag of Poland, complete with black ribbons, as the names of the victims were read out from a white stage decorated with a giant cross and photographs of the dead. The crowds bowed their heads. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where flowers and candles were brought by Warsaw residents for the victims of the presidential plane crash On 18 April, the couple's caskets were driven at a slow pace through the streets of Warsaw, passing the city hall and a museum dedicated to the 1944 Warsaw Uprising which Kaczy≈Ñski favoured. The funeral ceremony began at 2 pm local time (12:00 UTC) with a mass held at Krak√≥w's St Mary's Basilica, with thousands attending. Archbishop of Krak√≥w Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz presided over the ceremony, and addressed President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev personally: \\"The sympathy and help we have received from Russian brothers has breathed new life into a hope for closer relations and reconciliation between our two Slavic nations\\". Former president Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski told TVN24 that, \\"It [Katy≈Ñ] is a cursed place. It sends shivers down my spine. First the flower of the Second Polish Republic is murdered in the forests around Smolensk, now the elite of the Third Polish Republic die in this tragic aircraft crash when approaching Smolensk North Airport.\\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that, \\"The contemporary world has not seen such a tragedy\\". Former Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller, who had himself suffered injuries in a helicopter crash while in office, said that Poland's aircraft were known to be in need of replacement, despite the lack of evidence that anything was wrong with the particular airplane; \\"I once said that we will one day meet in a funeral procession, and that is when we will take the decision to replace the aircraft fleet,\\" he said. The crash fuelled anti-Russian sentiment among far right extremists, with Polish nationalists invoking the tragedy during a riot outside the Russian embassy in Warsaw in November 2013.Thousands of protesters converge on Russian embassy in Poland, Agence France-Presse, 12 November 2013 Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in church Dmitry Medvedev addresses the people of Poland. (subtitles in English from official transcript available) Improvised memorial at the Russian crash site United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lays a wreath at the Katyn Cross Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressed their condolences to the acting President and speaker of the parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski. President Medvedev also announced that 12 April 2010 would be a national day of mourning in Russia. Chairman of International Committee of the State Duma Konstantin Kosachev said that \\"Katyn claimed yet more victims\\". Chairman of the State Duma Boris Gryzlov has expressed condolences. Russians and foreigners laid flowers and candles at the Polish embassy in Moscow, and at the Polish consulates-general in Saint Petersburg and Kaliningrad. After the aircraft crash, the state owned Russia Channel broadcast the film Katy≈Ñ for the second time in Russia. The film, which was not distributed in Russia, was first shown in Russia on another state-owned channel, the less popular Kultura Channel on 2 April 2010. The first showing of Katy≈Ñ was a political event, which was followed by a serious discussion of Polish-Russian relations by politicians and public figures, and drew high audience numbers for the smaller channel, with an estimated 100 million Russian viewers. While Polish commentators saw Putin's participation in the ceremony held on 7 April as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers at the site of the crash. Tusk knelt and briefly hid his face in his hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours. On 11 April, holding a bouquet of red roses, Putin was reported to have appeared truly distressed as he escorted Kaczy≈Ñski's body to a Warsaw-bound plane. Later Putin said in a Polish television interview: \\"This is of course first and foremost Poland's tragedy and that of the Polish people, but it is also our tragedy. We mourn with you\\". The Russian response has been noted favourably by Poles, with talk of a thawing in the relationship between Russia and Poland. Witold Waszczykowski, deputy head of Poland's National Security Bureau, told Reuters, \\"We did not expect this gentle, kind approach, this personal involvement from Putin. Naturally it will have a positive impact on the relationship between our countries.\\" Jerzy Bahr, the Polish ambassador to Russia also stated, \\"We can sense Russian solidarity at every step of the way.\\" As part of this thawing of relations, on 28 April 18 days after the crash, Russia's state Archive publicly published a number of previously secret files on the Katyn massacre on their website. The files were declassified in the early 1990s, but before their publication they were only available to specialized researchers. The strongest admission was yet to come. On 26 November 2010, the Russian State Duma passed a resolution admitting that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin personally approved the Katyn massacre. The Soviets had long claimed Nazi Germany were the ones responsible. Although this stance changed in 1990 when Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the Soviet NKVD secret police carried out the massacre, the November 2010 resolution was the first time the Russian government admitted direct involvement by Stalin. In an interview with Rzeczpospolita, Andrei Illarionov, Vladimir Putin's former advisor, noted, \\"... contrary to the promises, the investigation of this crash is neither transparent nor dynamic.\\" and added, \\"... the Polish side does not have full and free access to documents and evidence.\\" Illarionov was also one of the signatories of an open letter written by Russian dissidents, which voiced concerns about the conduct of the investigation. According to the letter, \\"rapprochement with the current Russian authorities is more important for the Polish government than determining the truth about the plane crash.\\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk responded that his government would obtain flight data from the Russian investigators before making its own judgment and revealing it to the public. International At least 96 countries, 13 international organizations and several other entities expressed their reaction on behalf of the incident. An official mourning was proclaimed in 18 countries other than Poland. Condolence books were opened in many public locations such as the Polish centre in Hammersmith, where Prince Charles signed their condolence book. Countries with official mourning Twenty-three countries observed a varying number of days of official mourning; Brazil: 3, Bulgaria: 1, Canada: 1, Cape Verde: 1, Croatia: 1, Czech Republic: 2, Estonia: 1, Germany: 1, Georgia: 1, Hungary: 1, Latvia: 1, Lithuania: 4, Maldives: 2, Moldova: 1, Montenegro: 1, Poland: 9, Romania: 1, translate Russia: 1, Serbia: 1, Slovakia: 1, Spain: 1, Turkey: 1, Ukraine: 1. Victims of the airplane crash were also commemorated by minute of silence before several football matches throughout Europe, including El Cl√°sico Real Madrid C.F. ‚Äì FC Barcelona in Spain; or FC Ban√≠k Ostrava ‚Äì 1. FC Slov√°cko and Prague derby AC Sparta Prague ‚Äì SK Slavia Praha in the Czech Republic. Some concern arose that Kaczy≈Ñski's funeral would have to be delayed as a consequence of volcanic ash emanating from Iceland and the resulting air travel disruption in Europe. Only one airport in the country was open, and several international dignitaries were unable to attend. The funeral nonetheless went ahead as scheduled. NATO was reportedly concerned over the possible compromise of many of its secret codes and communications procedures to the Russian government. Many of the Polish government and military officials on the aircraft apparently carried secret NATO communication key codes and devices which were recovered by the Russians after the crash. In 2018 PACE issued resolution #2246 which calls Russian Federation to hand over the wreckage of the plane.  Polish parliamentary committee investigation  In July 2010, a group of Polish MPs, mostly from the Law and Justice party, formed the \\"Parliamentary Committee for the investigation of the Tu-154M crash in Smolensk\\", chaired by the party's deputy leader Antoni Macierewicz. Later in November, Macierewicz called for the United States to lead an independent international commission on the accident. Some US Republican congressmen supported this idea but the U.S. has never acted upon it. In March 2015 the Polish committee published a report in which it claimed that two separate explosions took place on board the Tupolev in the last few seconds of its flight, bringing the aircraft down; a third explosion allegedly occurred after the impact with the ground. The committee's conclusions were partly based on a paper by Dr. Wies≈Çaw Binienda of the University of Akron, in which the author presented computer simulations that claimed to prove that the impact with the birch tree could not have severed the plane's wing. The paper, however, was self-published and not peer- reviewed. According to group's scientists ‚Äì Binienda, Kazimierz Nowaczyk from the University of Maryland and Gregory Szuladzi≈Ñski ‚Äì the direct cause of the crash was not a collision with an obstacle, but two explosions in the last phase of the flight: first on the left, by which the plane lost part of the left wing, then another inside the hull. Alleged contradictions, errors and manipulations in the official reports has been pointed out. Binienda also claimed that the cut wingtip couldn't fly over 100 m from the tree, the hull couldn't be torn to the outside by a collision with the ground, there should be a crater in the ground as a result of the crash if the plane wasn't torn in the air before. Szuladzinski's report stated that: any landing (or fall) in a wooded area, no matter how adverse, and at what angle, could not in any way result in such fragmentation, which has been documented. Nowaczyk analyzed data from FMS and TAWS system and came to the conclusions that the plane flew over the tree and was torn at a height over 30 m above the ground. Wac≈Çaw Berczy≈Ñski, constructor of Boeing pointed to the pulled out rivets of the sheeting and claimed that it could be caused only by an internal explosion. Every year since October 2012, an independent (financed by its participants) Smolensk Conference was organised in Warsaw and was attended by scientists and researchers from Polish and foreign universities to provide a forum intended to introduce and discuss independent studies related to the catastrophe. The last (fourth) of these meetings was convened in November 2015 and its proceedings (with summaries and abstracts in several languages) were published in 2016 (with a letter from the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda). The Scientific Committee of the Conferences was chaired by Professor Kazimierz Flaga. The Advisory Committee included 114 academics. , Russia is still in possession of the wreckage and black boxes of the Tupolev, having refused various requests made by the Polish government to return the items.  Claims of explosives traces  On 30 October 2012, Polish magazine Rzeczpospolita reported that traces of explosives had been detected by investigators in the wreckage of the Tupolev, on the wings and in the cabin. The claims were denied by Polish prosecutors‚Äîwho pointed out that a number of common substances could as well have produced the observed readings‚Äîand were later withdrawn by the magazine itself. Rzeczpospolita's editor-in-chief and three other staff, including the reporter of the initial claim, resigned from their jobs. The author of the article in question, Cezary Gmyz, maintained that what he wrote was confirmed by four independent sources. In November 2015, a court in Poland ruled in favour of the sacked journalists, stating that the information published in the article correctly reflected the state of knowledge at the time of publication. In 2017, it was announced that the British Ministry of Defence was engaged by the Polish Government to examine the wreckage of the aircraft for traces of explosives. The work will be done by scientists based at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory at Fort Halstead, Kent. , no results from the analysis were published. New Polish investigation Following Law and Justice's victory at the 2015 Polish parliamentary elections, the new conservative government appointed the chair of the Polish Parliamentary Committee of Investigation, Antoni Macierewicz, as defence minister, and the question of the Smolensk crash was brought back into the government's agenda. New foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski announced that Poland would sue Russia in a human rights court over Moscow's withholding of the wreckage. The Consul of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly designated a special investigation rapporteur who will carry out an inquiry on whether holding back the wreckage and other evidence material by the Russians is justified. On 25 November 2015, government spokeswoman El≈ºbieta Witek called for former Prime Minister Donald Tusk to be put on trial for his handling of the 2010 air disaster. Adam Lipi≈Ñski, from the Prime Minister's Chancellery, accused Tusk of negligence and weakness in handling the investigation and the restitution of the wreckage. Deputy Minister of Culture Jaros≈Çaw Sellin stated his absolute conviction that there were explosions on board the Tupolev and that the real causes of the presidential plane crash has not yet been established. In November 2015, the government shut down the faktysmolensk.gov.pl website, which had been set up by state authorities under Tusk's cabinet to explain in simple terms the findings of the official investigations. No reason was given for the website closure. An independent mirror was created shortly after. Polish President Andrzej Duda, from the Law and Justice party, wrote a letter to the participants of the 4th Smolensk Conference that took place on 14 November 2015 in Warsaw, describing the official Russian and Polish accident reports as 'simply hypotheses' in contrast with evidence, and stating that the investigation on the crash is not complete. In February 2016, Macierewicz announced the official reopening of the investigation, declaring that the previous inquiries were \\"riddled with mistakes\\" and reaffirming his belief that the aircraft disintegrated mid-air immediately before impacting the ground. As part of the renewed investigation, the remains of the deceased Polish president were exhumed on 14 November 2016. In January 2018, the Polish government subcommittee re-investigating the accident claimed that a number of explosions had occurred aboard the airliner. In February 2018, the commission presented their preliminary findings, repeating the earlier claims. The head of the previous commission, Maciej Lasek, dismissed the claims as \\"illusions\\" and \\"propaganda\\". In April 2018, the commission headed by Antoni Macierewicz published a report which said that the plane was destroyed in the air by an explosion, and that Russian air traffic controllers at the Smolensk air base had misled the pilots about the plane's location during its approach to the runway.  Conspiracy theories  Soon after the crash, Artur G√≥rski, a Polish MP from the Law and Justice party, claimed that the Smolensk air traffic controllers were ordered to prevent the plane from landing, so that the president could not attend the Katy≈Ñ ceremony, resulting in the crash. G√≥rski later apologized for his remarks. Conspiracy theories have been in circulation since the day of the accident, claiming in general that the crash was in fact a political assassination, an act of war against Poland or an elaborate coup attempt, possibly orchestrated by Russia. The range of such theories has been described by some international media as \\"dizzying\\"; from the idea that the fog around the airport had been artificially produced, to victims' bodies being doctored in fake autopsies, to the idea that explosives were planted on board the plane. Law and Justice's leader Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski and the head of the parliamentary committee of investigation Antoni Macierewicz have been described as long time supporters of the assassination theory, and have repeatedly accused the then prime minister Donald Tusk of being involved in a cover-up. Macierewicz repeated these accusations as newly appointed minister of defence in 2016, causing a significant controversy in Polish, Russian and international media. Opinion polls in 2012 and 2013 found that one-third of Poles think it is possible that the Smolensk crash was an assassination. All of the evidence allegedly supporting alternative theories is discussed in the 2013 report of Maciej Lasek commission. For example, the bomb explosion theory is not supported by the fact that the plane's debris are concentrated in a relatively small 160x50 m area, and no parts of the plane's interior were found before the first ground contact. However, the bomb theory does have some support: British air accident investigator Frank Taylor, who was involved in the investigation into the losses of Pan Am Flight 103 and British Airtours Flight 28M, challenged the official report. He claimed that the Russian authorities came up with their theory that the aircraft collided with the tree, and then made the evidence fit that theory. He claimed that there were explosions on board the aircraft, including in its wing, immediately before it reached the tree. Russia dismissed his claims. In popular culture The National Geographic TV series Mayday (also called Air Crash Investigation or Air Emergency) dramatized the accident in a 2013 episode titled Death of the President.

The School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh are acting as the parent organisation for this project. Other key funders which provided match funding are SICSA and WYLLN. There is a growing list of sponsors and partners for this project which now includes NCR Corporation, Blonde Digital, brightsolid, Harvey Nash, British Computer Society, nti Leeds, Carbon Imagineering, Kilo 75, Codeworks, Digital 20/20 and the WEA (Workers' Educational Association) Scotland. The Speaker Series was launched in Dundee Contemporary Arts by Silicon Valley Entrepreneur Shanna Telllerman CEO of Wildpockets a spin out company from Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center. In late 2009, Girl Geek Scotland won funding from Informatic Ventures in Edinburgh, to develop three intensive residential workshops for 2010 on the subjects of 'Creativity into business', 'Developing a Funding Strategy' and 'Negotiation Strategies and Techniques'. The Workshops are for women in pre-start-up business; start-up businesses and existing businesses in the technology sector in Scotland. The Enterprise Workshops took place over three weekends in September, October and November in 2010 and helped approximately 30 female entrepreneurs progress or develop their enterprise concepts and start-up businesses. Girl Geek Scotland went dark during 2011‚Äì2012 while many of the volunteer organisers needed to focus on their main projects. But in Spring 2013, the GGS organisers were awarded funding for more events 2013‚Äì2014. The biggest was a special summer double event called \\"Conversations with Silicon Valley\\" that welcomed four inspirational female sector leaders from Silicon Valley to take part in a dinner panel, chaired by Suzanne Doyle-Morris. The guests were Heidi Roizen, Wendy Lea, Ann Winblad, and Karen White; followed by the \\"Summer Start-Up Party\\" for the local tech and start-up community.

The Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative tournament\\") is an annual tournament where an established CMLL veteran teams up with a Novato or rookie in a tag team tournament, although at times the Novato is not so much a rookie, but either a wrestler who has been given a new ring character or has never participated in the Gran Alternativa before. The format of the tournament was changed for the 2010 tournament, traditionally it featured 8 tag teams and a one night tournament, but in 2010 it featured 16 teams, split over three CMLL Super Viernes shows. H√©ctor Garza and P√≥lvora won the tournament, defeating Volador Jr. and Delta in the finals. History Starting in 1994 the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) created a special tournament concept where they would team up a novato, or rookie, with a veteran for a single-elimination tag team tournament. The tournament was called El Torneo Gran Alternativa, or \\"The Great Alternative Tournament\\" and became a recurring event on the CMLL calendar. CMLL did not hold a Gran Alternativa tournament in 1997 and 2000 held on each year from 2001 through 2010. The 2010 Gran Alternativa tournament was the 16th overall Gran Alternativa tournament. All tournaments have been held in Arena M√©xico. Background The tournament featured 15 professional wrestling matches under elimination rules, which means that you are eliminated if you lose a match. The teams were created specifically for the tournament, with no teams having worked together on a regular basis before, and in the past has not wrestled as a regular team after the Gran Alternativa is over. The tournament incorporated pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either villains (referred to as Rudos in Mexico) or good guys (T√©cnicos in Mexico) as they competed in wrestling matches with pre- determined outcomes. Tournament=Block A On April 7, 2010 CMLL announced the Novato participants for Block A of the 2010 Gran Alternativa tournament, featuring three wrestlers that had been involved in the 2009 torneo Gran Alternativa, ending a two-year practice that stated that you could not wrestle as a novato in the tournament if you had participated in a previous year's tournament. The returning novatos are Rey Cometa, P√≥lvora and Camorra. The five first time novatos were announced as Sensei, Diamante, Cancerbero, Inquisidor and Disturbio. When the full card for the April 16, 2010 CMLL Super Viernes show the full teams for Block A were announced as Diamante & La Sombra, Blue Panther and Rey Cometa, H√©ctor Garza and P√≥lvora, La M√°scara and Sensei, Atlantis and Inquisidor, El Terrible and Disturbio, Mephisto and Cancerbero and finally Rey Bucanero and Semental who replaced Camorra. Block A was won by H√©ctor Garza and P√≥lvora. ;Block A Block B Block B of the 2010 tournament took place on April 23, 2010, and the announced teams were: Delta (Novato) and Volador Jr., Guerrero Maya Jr. (Novato) and Valiente, √Ångel Azteca Jr. (Novato) and Shocker, Pegasso (Novato) and Toscano, Raziel (Novato) and Averno, Durango Kid (Novato) and El Texano Jr., Puma King (Novato) and √öltimo Guerrero and the team of Tiger Kid (Novato) and El Felino. Of note in Block B is the fact that Raziel has been a professional wrestler since 1996 but changed from the character Caligula to Raziel in late 2009 and thus is being billed as a Novato by CMLL. Block B also features Tiger Kid teaming up with his uncle El Felino, the only two wrestlers to have any sort of relationship going into the tournament. Block B was won by Delta and Volador Jr. ;Block B Finals The finals was contested under \\"best two out of three falls\\" rules and took place on the April 30, 2010 Super Viernes. P√≥lvora and H√©ctor Garza defeated Delta and Volador Jr. two falls to one, in 23:46 to win the 2010 Gran Alternativa.

Founded in 1938 as Zenit Ekaterinburg, the club had its name changed to Uralmash Ekaterinburg in 1960, like other teams from the city such as FC Ural. Four years later Uralmash reached the Soviet Top Division. In 1973 and 1974 it attained two 3rd spots, the club's best results in the Soviet era. After Uralmash was merged into OMZ the club was bought in 2000 by the newly formed company UMMC, adopting its current name. UMMC Ekaterinburg rapidly rose into the championship's elite, winning in 2002 its first national championship. The following year it won the Euroleague in its debut season, becoming the first Russian team to win the top European trophy. The team also defended its national title, making it a double. UMMC wasn't able to win the championship in the following five seasons with the rise of VBM-SGAU Samara and Spartak Moscow Region. In 2009 it began a new successful period, winning three doubles in a row. With five titles UMMC is the most successful active team in the championship.

He was the first keeper of the Wallace Collection at Hertford House, writing its first catalogue, and held that post from 1900 until his retirement in 1911 whereupon he was knighted for his service. Phillips was considered one of the most eminent critics in Victorian Britain, and his numerous scholarly and art history books were widely read. Biography The second son of Robert Abraham Phillips and Helen Levy, Claude Phillips was born at Gloster Villa, Regent's Park, London on 29 January 1846.

(pg. 454) Phillips eventually left the legal profession and became a music critic for the Daily Telegraph in the late 1880s. From 1885 to 1896, he was the English correspondent for the Gazette des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Among other Victorian era publications he wrote for included the Manchester Guardian, the Magazine of Art, the Academy and The Art Journal.Quinn, Richard Harold. Charles Ricketts and the Dial. Vol. 2. Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1977. Phillips became a widely known scholar in the field and later wrote several works on Joshua Reynolds, Antoine Watteau and Titian. One of his best known books was The Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1894). After a particularly well-received article on Rodin, he became a full-time art critic for the Daily TelegraphFehlbaum, Valerie. Ella Hepworth Dixon: The Story of a Modern Woman. Aldershot, UK and Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate Publishing, 2005. (pg. 16) in 1897. That same year, Phillips was appointed the first keeper of the Wallace Collection and spent the next three years preparing its catalogue prior to its opening at Hertford House in 1900. He held that post until his retirement 14 years later. In 1914 he was included in a caricature by Edmund Dulac which was part of the Wallace Collection. The humorous painting is called \\"Le Legende de Joseph\\". Phillips was succeeded by Dugald Sutherland MacColl, and received a knighthood for his service shortly afterwards. Phillips died on 9 August 1924 at the age of 78. A collection of his essays, Emotion in Art (1925), was published posthumously the following year.

Motorcycle Outreach was inspired by Riders for Health and applies the best practices from that organisation's success to countries outside the African continent. Motorcycle Outreach (MoR) supports an established project in East Nusa Tenggara in Indonesia. Health for All (HfA) provides primary healthcare transport for a catchment area of over fifty thousand people living in over fifty villages. Healthcare delivery by motorcycle has significantly improved the general health of the population in the areas served. Significance Effective healthcare delivery is the missing link in many health initiatives in the developing world. Trained health workers, perishable vaccines and improved facilities are of little use without reliable transport. The traditional solution of one-off contributions of vehicles delivers very little real value without informed vehicle choice, spare parts distribution and a budget for a servicing schedule. In contrast, the addition of reliable transport to an existing healthcare system has a disproportionate positive effect. This is reflected in the statement that as little as US$10 positively benefits 10,000 people by enabling regular village visits. Motorcycle Outreach highlights this gap and works to fill it both through support of an established project in Indonesia and promoting the solution as a way to improve aid delivery. Need In the 2007 Indonesian Health Survey women were asked whether they have problems seeking medical advice or treatment for themselves. The most often cited problem is getting money for treatment (25 percent). Other concerns include distance to health facility (15 percent), having to take transport (13 percent), and concern that no female worker is available (11 percent). Reliable transport enabling regular village healthcare visits helps to address each of these issues. History Motorcycle Outreach was set up by Simon Milward in 2002 to fund Health for All which he had founded in Indonesia. It was officially constituted as a UK Charity and Ltd company in late 2005, with its Directors drawn from the late Simon Milward's family and close friends. The official Charity was launched in November 2005, with a series of events, the most notable being a BMW Motorrad supported motorcycle ride to The Gambia, West Africa by David French and Craig Carey- Clinch. As of 2010, MoR continued to support HfA in Flores, Indonesia. The UK offices are based in London.

Its first half is new material, while its second half is a compilation of tracks from previous albums. It is also the only record they made for Blue Note, a jazz label, which was then owned and controlled by their current label at the time, United Artists Records, so it was not a matter of changing labels or going outside of contract. And it is their first album to put an emphasis on instrumental jazz-based music, although some tracks have vocals. This album was apparently Blue Notes first Platinum Disc selling album. A single from the album was issued, also on Blue Note: \\"L.A. Sunshine\\" backed with \\"Slowly We Walk Together\\"; both are edited versions. The Album was released as re-issue in UK, on Island Records, as Platinum Funk and as a single album with tracks as Side 1 - War is Coming War is Coming, I got you, L.A.Sunshine (Shortened to 8.40 from original 11.52) Side 2 River Niger, Slowly We Walk Together, Platinum Jazz Packaging The album was packaged as a companion disc to War's Greatest Hits album, and like that album, sports a cover showing a picture of the record itself, in the form of a platinum disc award (while the Greatest Hits cover showed a gold disc; but the actual records within both covers were on regular black vinyl). The cover was printed using metallic silver ink. Cover design concept is credited to Lee Oskar. The record labels on the cover resemble the actual record's labels, but are not an exact match, as the front cover label lists all tracks from sides one and two, and the back cover lists sides three and four, which is not done on the actual labels. (Note that the cover illustration shown here is from a reissue on MCA Records - whose successor Universal Music Group now owns Blue Note - as issued in Canada, and the cover's label design has been modified to replace the Blue Note logo with MCA. Furthermore, the records within this edition have labels that do not match the blue labels on the cover, the records having MCA's regular rainbow-on-black design. For CD reissue, the cover was further modified to show a logo for Avenue Records.) There are some other trivial inaccuracies in the picture: the records have no centre hole, the photo of the record has been mirror reversed (as seen from the run-out groove), and the matrix number (which is the actual album's matrix, and not mirror reversed) is inscribed over top of the run-out groove, which is never done (at least not deliberately) on actual records. Contents The idea for the album began when the group briefly considered adding a second compilation disc of instrumental music to their Greatest Hits album, to demonstrate their wide range of musical styles. Blue Note expressed an interest in releasing an album of this type, which was feasible since War was in the process of switching from United Artists Records to MCA (allowing the group to record a one-off album for another label between contracts), as well as the fact that Blue Note was distributed by United Artists, and a licensing deal between the two labels for reissue of material from previous United Artists albums was possible. Unable to decide whether to stay with the compilation idea, or record a new album for Blue Note, the group decided to do both, and make it a double album. Six new tracks were recorded for disc one, but a wrinkle occurred at the last minute when United Artists decided it was willing to license their older recordings to the album only if they appeared in edited form. The list of songs to be licensed had already been decided, and their editing would have made the second disc much shorter than the first, so the order of songs was altered. The result was that the new material covers all of sides one and two, and the first track on side three, while the rest is a compilation of tracks from previous albums. Had the original sequence and full length songs been used, the two discs would have had total timings of 46:55 and 47:41 respectively. After trimming nearly 15 minutes from the reissued tracks, the album's total time was 79:36. CD issues feature an edited version of \\"L.A. Sunshine\\" lasting 9:52.

He died in the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, when a plane transporting a number of Polish notables, including the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, crashed en route to a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Katy≈Ñ massacre. Analysts have said that Skrzypek's death is unlikely to change the path of monetary policy in Poland. Born in Katowice, Skrzypek graduated from the Silesian University of Technology before taking an MBA from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, further post-graduate degrees at Cracow University of Economics, the University of Silesia, Georgetown University and at IESE Business School at the University of Navarra. It was on 10 January 2007 that Skrzypek was appointed to the role of President of the NBP, with a vote of 239 Sejm deputies in favor, 202 against and one abstaining. He replaced Leszek Balcerowicz. His choice by President Kaczynski was controversial; opposition parties and others criticised his comparative lack of experience. Prior to this position, he had been acting President of the managing board of PKO BP, Poland's largest bank. He had also held positions in the Supreme Chamber of Control (NIK), serving as Deputy President of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management and working at Polish State Railways (PKP). He acted as a deputy to the Mayor of Warsaw between 2002 and 2005, responsible, inter alia, for \\"financial policy, investment projects and corporate governance\\". From May 2000 to June 2001, he was a member of a group of advisors at one division of PZU, a Polish insurance company. Piotr Wiesiolek was named as Skrzypek's acting successor, though Skrzypek's sudden death on the 10 April 2010 may still cause short term problems for the bank; permanent Presidents of the Bank are usually nominated by Presidents of Poland, but Lech Kaczynski also died in the crash. After Skrzypek's death, the Wall Street Journal reported how the management committee of the central bank had recently \\"come into open conflict with six members of the Council [of Ministers] after a council majority voted to change the rules dictating how the bank's net profit was calculated\\". On 16 April 2010, Skrzypek was posthumously awarded the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta.

On February 27, 1860, six Canossian Sisters from Venice and Padua began their journey to Hong Kong arriving there on April 12, 1860. From there the sisters went to Macau and then to Southeast Asia. Today they count eighteen provinces with approximately 2,700 Sisters in more than 336 communities and in 32 countries around the world. Their primary works of charity include education, catechesis, and care of the sick. The General House is in Rome. (FDCC is the Italian abbreviation of \\"Figlie Della Carit√† Canossiane\\"). ENCA or Enlace Canossiano America (Canossian Network in America) is the union of the three Canossian Provinces in America: Brazil, Argentina and North America.

In the United States the Canossian Daughters of Charity run a retreat center, the Canossian Spirituality Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Sisters in Macau spread out to other countries in Southeast Asia towards the end of the 19th century. In 1894 mainly Italian and Portuguese-speaking Sisters arrived at the Portuguese Mission at St. Joseph's Church in Singapore (then part of the Straits Settlements) and expanded to Malaya, both of which were part of the British Empire. As of 2008 the Sisters are the largest religious orders in the Archdiocese of Singapore and operate 3 mainstream schools - St Anthony's Canossian Primary & Secondary School & Canossa Catholic Primary School; 2 pre- schools/kindergartens, 1 special school for the deaf and 2 homes for the Aged Sick providing palliative care.

They are present in Italy, Brazil, Kenya, Tanzania, India and the Philippines. (FdCC means \\"Figli della Carit√† Canossiani\\").

In mid-1947 he went to England to gain more expertise in the field. He worked mostly at the Middlesex Thoracic Unit, Harefield, London with Vernon Thompson, and at the North East Regional Thoracic Unit, Shotley Bridge, Newcastle upon Tyne with George Mason. In August 1949 Windsor returned to St Vincent's as an assistant staff surgeon. In 1950 he was given an honorary appointment as Thoracic Surgeon. At St Vincent's, Windsor created by 1950 a specialist department of thoracic surgery. With the help of his two prot√©g√©s, Victor Chang and Mark Shanahan, Windsor was the Australian pioneer of cardiac valvular surgery in 1951; surgery employing hypothermia in 1954; cardiac valve replacement in 1963; coronary artery grafting in 1969, and, most notably Australias first heart transplant in 1968. The patient, Richard Pye, only survived for six weeks. The surgery was not the problem, but inadequacy of immunosuppression techniques at the time. The next transplant at St Vincent's was not performed until 1974. By that time control of organ rejection had improved greatly.  Retirement  Windsor retired from St Vincent's Public Hospital and from operative surgery in October 1979.  Private life  Windsor married Imelda Mary Burfitt, a secretary, on 29 August 1942 at St John's College, Camperdown. They met while she was a student at Sancta Sophia College, University of Sydney. They had five sons and a daughter. Windsor died on 20 March 1987 at Darlinghurst. He is buried in the Catholic section of Botany Cemetery in Matraville, New South Wales.

The 464th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 23, 2010. In the episode, Moe discovers his talent for judging in competitions and is invited to appear on the show American Idol. Meanwhile, Homer drives Marge crazy when he starts spending too much time at home, and Lisa tries to comfort Santa's Little Helper. The episode was written by Allen Glazier and Dan Greaney and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode also features references to Lost and its series finale, Tiger Woods, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. \\"Judge Me Tender\\" has received mixed reviews from critics with many criticizing the short and unfunny cameos of the American Idol judges except for Simon Cowell. They especially criticized Ellen DeGeneres since she had experience as a voice artist in an animated film called (Finding Nemo). The episode went down 14% from the previous week's episode due to the competition of airing against the Lost clip show, according to Nielsen Media Research. Plot Homer and Bart participate at an \\"Ugliest Dog\\" contest in Springfield\\", entering Santa's Little Helper. At the contest, Moe feels neglected because nobody wants to let him sit next to them (Agnes Skinner even sets the chair next to her on fire). Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much to the delight of the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a place to sit. During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) as the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of the judges on American Idol, since several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled. Moe flies to Los Angeles and becomes a prot√©g√© of Simon Cowell, who then explains all the details of his job, but before his first show, Cowell shows several clips of people (including Mr. Burns) who think the judgments of Moe are very offensive and became angry with him (with even the usually innocent and good-natured Ralph talking so boldly about Moe that most of his words have to be censored). Cowell warns him to not \\"become the mean judge, like I did\\", since he himself does not have many friends. He tries to be more positive, but when Cowell mocks his judgment of a contestant, he realizes that Cowell tricked him; angered, Moe threatens Cowell's life on air, but is apprehended by security and expelled from the building. Meanwhile, Homer feels bored after Moe closed his bar to judge competitions and decides to spend time with Marge. After his presence at the house becomes too annoying, Marge decides to help him to find a new bar, but when this fails (due to the obnoxious customers), Grampa advises Marge to put Homer in a round of golf, where he will become too distracted to even bother her again. However, before the game begins, Marge meets an elderly man who tells her that he got addicted to golf and barely saw his family again. Marge then realises that she was going too far and stops Homer from playing, and they both end up having makeup sex. In the end, in the reopening of his tavern, Moe explains that he was put on trial and, as punishment for his sociopathic behavior, he is not only banned from California, but is also forbidden from ever judging anything again anywhere in the country (he cannot even express his opinion on how much beer a person should drink before driving). But fortunately for Moe, he is also forbidden from watching the Fox network, something that he acknowledges as being a blessing in disguise, as this leads to an increase of the customers in his bar, including Rupert Murdoch, who asks him to put on The Jay Leno Show. Production Simon Cowell guest starred in his second appearance on the show after \\"Smart and Smarter\\". \\"Judge Me Tender\\" was written by Allen Glazier and Dan Greaney and directed by Steven Dean Moore, his third directing credit that season after \\"Oh Brother, Where Bart Thou?\\" and \\"Stealing First Base\\". The episode features guest stars Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, Ellen DeGeneres, Kara DioGuardi and Ryan Seacrest, making it Cowell's second guest appearance on The Simpsons after \\"Smart and Smarter\\" in 2004. Rupert Murdoch also stars as himself in the episode‚Äîhis second guest star appearance, with the first being \\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\\" in 1999.

Specifically, this class of binding proteins are built upon a diversified library of the 10th FN3 domain of human fibronectin. Monobodies are a simple and robust alternative to antibodies for creating target-binding proteins. The hybrid term monobody was coined in 1998 by the Koide group who published the first paper demonstrating the monobody concept using the tenth FN3 domain of human fibronectin. Monobodies are generated from combinatorial libraries in which portions of the FN3 scaffold are diversified using molecular display and directed evolution technologies such as phage display, mRNA display and yeast surface display. A large number of monobodies that have high affinity and high specificity to their respective targets have been reported. Monobodies belong to the class of molecules collectively called antibody mimics (or antibody mimetics) and alternative scaffolds that aim to overcome shortcomings of natural antibody molecules. A major advantage of monobodies over conventional antibodies is that monobodies can readily be used as genetically encoded intracellular inhibitors, that is you can express a monobody inhibitor in a cell of choice by simply transfecting the cell with a monobody expression vector. This is because of the characteristics of the underlying FN3 scaffold: small (~90 residues), stable, easy to produce, and its lack of disulfide bonds that makes it possible to produce functional monobodies regardless of the redox potential of the cellular environment, including the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and nucleus. In contrast, most antibodies and antibody fragments depend on disulfide bonds formation and they must be produced under an oxidizing environment. The monobody technology has been adopted in the biotechnology industry, most notably by Adnexus, a biotechnology company which has been part of Bristol-Myers Squibb since 2007 under the name of Adnectins (originally as Trinectins by its predecessor, Phylos). An example is pegdinetanib (Angiocept), an antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), which has entered Phase II clinical trials investigating the treatment of glioblastoma in October 2007. Structure The native FN3 scaffold consists of 94 amino acids and has a molecular mass of about 10 kDa, fifteen times smaller than an IgG type antibody and comparable to the size of a single variable domain of an antibody. They are based on the structure of human fibronectin, more specifically on its tenth extracellular type III domain. This domain has a structure similar to antibody variable domains, with seven beta sheets forming a beta-sandwich and three exposed loops on each side corresponding to the three complementarity-determining regions. Monobodies lack binding sites for metal ions and the central disulfide bond. Monobody library designs Monobodies with high affinity and specificity for different target molecules can be generated from combinatorial libraries in which portions of the FN3 scaffold are diversified. There are two distinct designs of monobody libraries that have been successful. The first type modifies some or all of the loops BC (between the second and third beta sheets), DE (between the fourth and fifth beta sheets) and FG (between the sixth and seventh sheets). This design creates diversified positions on a convex surface that is suitable for targeting concave surfaces such as enzyme active sites. The second type modifies positions in some or all of the C, D, F and G (or the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 7th) strands in addition to the CD and FG loops. This design creates a flatter, slightly concave surface that is suitable for targeting surfaces typically involved in protein-protein interactions.

Sabbatucci's mother was a first cousin of Fitzroy player Frank Curcio. Playing career After a year with Fitzroy in reserve grade Sabbatucci moved to St Kilda for the 1954 VFL season, playing five matches in his first season. His first VFL game was against Melbourne and he kicked 3 goals. Vin won the Best & Fairest for St Kilda Reserves in 1954. ‚ÄòThe Argus‚Äô newspaper described Vin as a ‚Äònuggety rover‚Äô and in another match report referred to his ‚Äòhard work‚Äô around the packs. Vin played a total of 6 VFL matches and kicked 9 goals. Returning for the 1955 VFL season he played only one match, ending his VFL career at the age of 20. His last match for St Kilda was against South Melbourne in 1955 In June 1955 Vin crossed to Camberwell in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). Professional Running Career While Vin made his mark in VFL and VFA football, he was also regarded as an outstanding professional runner and, in later years, a running coach. Sabbatucci took to professional running in 1950's in an effort to increase his speed for football. Sabbatucci first ‚Äòmade the news‚Äô in pro-running in December 1956 when he won the Talbot Gift (off 8 yards) in 12.3 seconds. He also won the Talbot Sprint (75 yards) on that day. Further to this Sabbatucci won the Northcote gift in 1962 in a time of 12.3 seconds. Over the next twenty years, Vin became a celebrity in the sport of professional foot racing, training and running himself, claiming race victories and running in multiple finals, most notable being a finalist in the Bendigo gift 4 times, but unfortunately not claiming a win in any of the 4 final appearances. Vin was recognised as a leading coach and trained many of Melbourne‚Äôs best professional runners including Evan Armstrong, who won the Bendigo Gift (1977) and Brian Parker, who won that event in 1971. Vin also trained Prahran Gift winners Rod Butters (1982) and Bill Liston (1984). In 1977-78, Vin won the Australian Professional Runners and Trainers Association most celebrated award of the ‚ÄòTrainer of the Year‚Äô. Vin competed throughout Victoria and interstate, claiming more race victories.

Over 60 were built, serving with the Yugoslav Royal Air Force (YAF) until the fall of Yugoslavia in 1941. After that, some PVTs were used by the newly formed Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, sometimes as ground attack aircraft. Design and development The Prva Srpska Fabrika Aeroplana ≈Ωivojin Rogo≈æarski was the first Serbian aircraft manufacturer in Yugoslavia, founded in 1924. In about 1933 its team of Rudolf Fizir, Sima Milutinoviƒá, Kosta Sivƒçev and Adem Bi≈°ƒçeviƒá designed the PVT, a training aircraft with tandem open cockpits in an oval wooden monocoque fuselage. Its wooden, canvas covered wings were swept and parasol mounted well above the fuselage with pairs of lift struts to the lower fuselage and a central inverted V cabane. They carried long narrow chord ailerons, with prominent spades well clear of the upper surfaces. The PVT was powered by a 420 hp (313 kW) 7-cylinder radial Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7K radial engine, housed with its cylinder heads exposed and driving a two-bladed propeller. The fixed, divided type undercarriage had on each side a main shock absorber leg, its upper end attached to a steel pyramid protruding from the mid-fuselage keeping the leg closer to the vertical whilst providing a wide track. Each wheel was connected to the lower fuselage with a swinging V-strut. A simple tail skid completed the undercarriage. The horizontal tail and fixed fin were both canvas covered wooden structures, though the moving surfaces, also canvas covered, had metal frames. The tailplane was strut braced to the fuselage from below and wire braced above to the fin. It carried elevators which were spade assisted like the ailerons but also horn balanced. The unbalanced rudder was broad and rounded. Operational history The PVT prototype probably first flew in 1934. An initial production batch of 20 aircraft was delivered to the YAF during 1936.Aeroflight: Rogosarski PVT Another 40 were delivered during 1938-9, of which the last 10 had fixed 7.7 mm (0.303 in) forward firing machine guns fitted and were powered by a licence built version of the Gn√¥me- Rh√¥ne 7K engine, the IAM K7. More PVTs were under construction at the time of the Italo-German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. Fifteen PVTs captured by the Germans as a result were presented to the newly formed Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia. Later some of these were fitted with bomb racks and used as attack aircraft until 1945. A few PVTs, designated PVT-H, (the H from hidro) were configured as seaplanes on standard Edo (EDO Float Model 38) floats mounted on N-shaped struts. During 1938 and 1939, four PVT-H aircraft were delivered to the Yugoslav Royal Navy.

The term serves as an umbrella term for a variety of processes such as frost shattering, frost wedging and cryofracturing. The process may act on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from minutes to years and from dislodging mineral grains to fracturing boulders. It is most pronounced in high-altitude and high-latitude areas and is especially associated with alpine, periglacial, subpolar maritime and polar climates, but may occur anywhere at sub-freezing temperatures (between -3 and -8 ¬∞C) if water is present. Ice segregation Certain frost-susceptible soils expand or heave upon freezing as a result of water migrating via capillary action to grow ice lenses near the freezing front. This same phenomenon occurs within pore spaces of rocks. The ice accumulations grow larger as they attract liquid water from the surrounding pores. The ice crystal growth weakens the rocks which, in time, break up. It is caused by the expansion of ice when water freezes, putting considerable stress on the walls of containment. This is actually a very common process in all humid, temperate areas where there is exposed rock, especially porous rocks like sandstone. Sand can often be found just under the faces of exposed sandstone where individual grains have been popped off, one by one. This process is often termed frost spalling. In fact, this is often the most important weathering process for exposed rock in many areas. Similar processes can act on asphalt pavements, contributing to various forms of cracking and other distresses, which, when combined with traffic and the intrusion of water, accelerate rutting, the formation of potholes, and other forms of pavement roughness. Volumetric expansion The traditional explanation for frost weathering was volumetric expansion of freezing water. When water freezes to ice, its volume increases by nine percent. Under specific circumstances, this expansion is able to displace or fracture rock. At a temperature of -22 ¬∞C, ice growth is known to be able to generate pressures of up to 207MPa, more than enough to fracture any rock. For frost weathering to occur by volumetric expansion, the rock must have almost no air that can be compressed to compensate for the expansion of ice, which means it has to be water-saturated and frozen quickly from all sides so that the water does not migrate away and the pressure is exerted on the rock. These conditions are considered unusual, restricting it to a process of importance within a few centimeters of a rock's surface and on larger existing water- filled joints in a process called ice wedging. Not all volumetric expansion is caused by the pressure of the freezing water; it can be caused by stresses in water that remains unfrozen. When ice growth induces stresses in the pore water that breaks the rock, the result is called hydrofracture. Hydrofracturing is favoured by large interconnected pores or large hydraulic gradients in the rock. If there are small pores, a very quick freezing of water in parts of the rock may expel water, and if the water is expelled faster than it can migrate, pressure may rise, fracturing the rock. Since research in physical weathering begun around 1900, volumetric expansion was, until the 1980s, held to be the predominant process behind frost weathering. This view was challenged in 1985 and 1986 publications by Walder and Hallet. Nowadays researchers such as Matsuoka and Murton consider the \\"conditions necessary for frost weathering by volumetric expansion\\" as unusual. However the bulk of recent literature demonstrates that that ice segregation is capable of providing quantitative models for common phenomena while the traditional, simplistic volumetric expansion does not.\\"Periglacial weathering and headwall erosion in cirque glacier bergschrunds\\"; Johnny W.

It served to protect Dutch interests in the Baltic Sea, ended the Dutch intervention in the Swedish siege of Danzig, and renewed a fragile peace between the Dutch Republic and Sweden. Within the former, there was opposition to the treaty demanding elucidations, which were agreed upon only on 29 November (OS) / 9 December 1659 in the Convention of Helsing√∂r. Earlier in 1659, in the Concert of The Hague, England, France, and the Dutch Republic had agreed to include the treaty of Elbing in their common agenda regarding the Second Northern War. Background Coenraad van Beuningen During the Second Northern War, Charles X Gustav of Sweden aimed at establishing a Swedish dominion in Royal Prussia, part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and subdued most of the province in a campaign of December 1655.Press (1991), p. 401. The Dutch Republic heavily relied on grain imports from the Baltic Sea region, much of it was bought from Royal Prussia's chief city Danzig (Gdansk).Rowen (2003), p. 85.Trade with the Baltic Sea area was the backbone (\\"mother trade\\") of Dutch economy. Imports included grain, tar, wood, pitch and ash, exports included herring, salt, wine, dairy products and textiles. The imported goods were stapled in Amsterdam and in part re-exported, yet the Baltic grain was essential not only for commerce but also for feeding the Dutch population. The primary Dutch grain sources were Poland, Prussia and Livonia, Dutch-Baltic trade peaked around 1650. The port cities of the time were heavily influenced by Dutch culture and home to Dutch settlers. Frijhoff & Spies (2004), p. 134. When Swedish forces began raising a siege of Danzig in early January 1656, the key figures of contemporary Dutch politics, Johan de Witt and Coenraad van Beuningen, saw the Dutch trade in the Baltic endangered and feared an alliance of a strengthened Sweden with their rival Maritime Power, England. Van Beuningen, at that time residing in Copenhagen at the court of Sweden's adversary and Dutch ally Frederick III of Denmark, proposed declaring war on Sweden. De Witt favoured a more moderate approach, fearing follow-up declarations of war on the Dutch Republic by England and France. De Witt instead proposed aiding Danzig directly by dispatching a relief force, and in July gained consent for sending in a fleet and a landing force by the States-General of the NetherlandsRowen (2003), pp. 85-86. due to diplomatic efforts of Holland's diplomats in The Hague.Troebst (1997), p. 439. In late July, forty-two Dutch and nine Danish vessels arrived in Danzig,Rowen (2003), p. 86.Just a few years before, in the course of the First Anglo‚ÄìDutch War (1652‚Äì54), the Dutch Republic had raised a navy consisting of dedicated warships. Before, the Dutch fleet only consisted of armed merchant vessels. Frijhoff & Spies (2004), p. 133. carrying 10,000 soldiers and 2,000 guns. The army made landfall and a Dutch commander took over Danzig's defense. Christer Bonde, Sweden's ambassador in London, alerted Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell who sent letters to Sweden and the Dutch Republic urging for a peaceful settlement.Fallon (1989), p. 165. Terms Johan de Witt The treaty was concluded on 11 September 1656,Pieken (1994), p. 92. which was 1 SeptemberKirby (1990), p. 188. on the Julian calendar then used in the Baltic area. Two earlier Dutch-Swedish trade agreements of 1640 and 1645 were confirmed. Sweden assured Dutch merchants free passage to Danzig as well as free trade and navigation in the Baltic Sea. The port dues in trade cities like Danzig and Pillau (now Baltiysk) were not to be raised.Van der Bijl (1995), p. 140. Sweden further promised to respect Danzig's neutrality in the Second Northern War,Postma (2007), p. 33; Rowen (2003), p. 86; Van der Bijl (1995), p. 140. and granted the Dutch Republic the status of a \\"most favoured nation.\\"Kirby (1990), p. 188; Rowen (2003), p. 86. Sweden and the Dutch Republic assured mutual friendship.Postma (2007), p. 33. Implementation The treaty met with opposition by several Dutch towns and Denmark. The Dutch opposition against the treaty was led by Van Beuningen, who refused to ratify it and looked forward to confront Sweden on the Danish side, while De Witt stood by the treaty and his strategy to aid Denmark and be conciliatory with Sweden at the same time. De Witt proposed 'elucidation' of the treaty rather than abandoning it, and the States-General accepted. Charles X Gustav of Sweden In 1657, Frederick III of Denmark declared war on Sweden, but his invasion was repelled by Charles X Gustav who subsequently took all of Denmark except for the capital city Copenhagen.Rowen (2003), p. 87. With the consent of De Witt, who thought that a balance of the Danish and Swedish powers would serve Dutch interests best, and despite the protest of part of the Dutch elites, Dutch auxiliaries were deployed to relieve the Swedish siege of Copenhagen.Rowen (2003), pp. 87‚Äì88. De Witt realized that the intervention on the Danish side bore the risk of provoking England, who was then allied to France.Rowen (2003), p. 88. Accordingly, the relief forces were advised to avoid any encounters with the English navy, and De Witt furthered negotiations with English and French diplomats to agree on a common stance regarding the Second Northern War. An agreement was reached in The Hague, drafted by English envoy Downing, which encompassed the treaty of Elbing along with its elucidations. The agreement was endangered when after the abdication of Richard Cromwell, Downing was instructed to remove the passages regarding Elbing, yet in May 1659 the new English government approved the original draft. The agreement, ratified on 21 May,Frijhoff & Spies (2004), p. 134. became known as Concert of The Hague.Frijhoff & Spies (2004), p. 134; Rowen (2003), p. 88. On 29 November (OS) / 9 December 1659, all Dutch parties and Sweden had settled for the elucidations of the treaty of Elbing, which was then accepted by all parties in the Convention of Helsing√∂r, concluded in Helsing√∏r (Helsing√∂r, Elsinore).

He previously played for the Canterbury Bulldogs and Wests Tigers in the National Rugby League. Taupau has also played for the World All Stars. Background Taupau was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He is of Samoan descent. Taupau moved to Sydney, Australia as a 10-year-old. He played junior rugby league for the Padstow Panthers and Greenacre Tigers. Taupau attended Endeavour Sports High School and represented the Australia Schoolboys team in 2008. Playing career=2010 In Round 5, Taupau made his first grade debut against the New Zealand Warriors off the interchange bench in the Bulldogs 30-24 loss at ANZ Stadium, in what was his only appearance of the season. Taupau was selected in the Samoan train on squad and the Junior Kiwis, and captained the Junior Kiwis. 2011 Taupau played 3 first grade games in 2011. He spent most of the year playing in the NSW Cup, and was named in the New South Wales Residents. Tapau playing for the Canterbury Bulldogs 2012 In Round 23 against the Brisbane Broncos, Taupau scored his first NRL career try in the 22-14 win at ANZ Stadium. He finished the season with 6 appearances, all victories. 2013 Taupau played as a starting prop for the first 7 rounds of the season in a period when James Graham was suspended. On 20 April, he made his international d√©but for Samoa against Tonga in the Pacific Rugby League International at Penrith Stadium, playing off the interchange bench in Samoa's 36-4 loss. On 16 June, it was announced that the club had granted Taupau a release to join the Wests Tigers from the 2014 season on a 3-year contract. He finished the season with 11 appearances. 2014 In February, Taupau was selected in the Wests Tigers inaugural Auckland Nines squad. In Round 1 against the St George Illawarra Dragons, he made his debut for the Wests Tigers in the Tigers 44-24 loss at ANZ Stadium, scoring a try in the match. Taupau's good form for the Tigers lead to him being selected to debut for the New Zealand national rugby league team in the May 2014 Anzac Test at SFS. He debuted off the interchange bench in the Kiwis 30-18 loss. Taupau was one of just two players to play in every Wests Tigers game for the season as well as scoring 3 tries, and was the club's second best for metres gained with the ball. At the end of the year, Taupau played in all four of the Kiwis games as they won the 2014 Rugby League Four Nations. In the final against Australia in the Kiwis 22-18 win, Taupau left the ground with a suspected neck injury, but had already made three tackle breaks, three offloads, and was described as \\"the toast of the team.\\" The New Zealand Herald said, \\"Time and again Taupau threw himself into the Australian line to see would-be defenders reeling.\\" 2015 Under new coach Jason Taylor, Taupau began the season playing as the team's starting lock. On 3 May, Taupau was selected for New Zealand in the 2015 Anzac Test, playing off interchange bench and gained the most metres amongst the New Zealand pack and had the most offloads of any forward for either side in the Kiwis 26-12 win. After receiving a crusher tackle during the game, Taupau made a throat-slitting gesture towards Australian opponent Sam Thaiday. Australian player Corey Parker said, \\"that's not a good look for the game, gee whiz. If you were a young kid looking in the stands watching that, I don't know what you're going to think.\\" Parker did admit, \\"I think it would be fair to say 12 months ago you might not have known too much about Marty Taupau, but certainly you do now.\\" Tapau playing for the Kiwis In Round 14 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the Tigers shock upset 34-6 win at ANZ Stadium, Taupau scored his first career double. He was said to be, \\"huge for the Tigers, scoring two brutally powerful tries while providing much- needed aggression and power through the middle of the field.\\" Finishing the season with 21 appearances and scoring 4 tries, Taupau would have completed his 2nd consecutive season without missing a game were it not for a 3-match suspension for a high shot on James Maloney, for which he was \\"widely panned\\". On 30 October, Taupau signed a 4-year contract with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles starting in 2016, after being granted a release from the final year of his Tigers contract. The manner in which Taupau's signing was announced was a bungled affair. As Taupau was in England with the Kiwis on their tour of Great Britain, an e-mail that outlined the contract was supposed to be sent from a UK based solicitor to Manly CEO Joe Kelly. However, in an embarrassing foul up the e-mail was accidentally sent to the G-mail account of Canadian theatre critic J. Kelly Nestruck who then announced Taupau's 4-year deal with the Sea Eagles on his Twitter page. Taupau would go on to play in all 3 matches against England in the Kiwis 2-1 Baskerville Shield series loss. 2016 On 13 February, Taupau played for the World All Stars in the 2016 All Stars match. Initially selected on the interchange bench, the late withdrawal of Chris Lawrence saw him starting in the second row in the 12-8 win. In Round 1, Taupau made his club debut for Manly against the Bulldogs, starting at lock in the 28-6 loss at Brookvale Oval. In Round 2 against his former club the Wests Tigers, Taupau scored his first try for the Sea Eagles in the 36-22 loss at Leichhardt Oval. On 6 May, Taupau played for the Kiwis against Australia, playing off the interchange bench in the 18-0 loss. 2017 In July 2017 Taupau enrolled in a Bachelor of Business degree after developing an interest in marketing and economics and attends lectures at the UTS (University of Technology Sydney) Ultimo campus one night per week after finishing his training with the Sea Eagles at Narrabeen. He has stated on record that he would prefer to be at university studying something than being in the gym lifting weights. 2018 Taupau made 24 appearances for Manly in 2018 as the club endured one of its toughest ever seasons narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon by 2 competition points. There were speculations that Taupau was departing the club following the conclusion of the year to join the Sydney Roosters but the move did not eventuate. 2019 Taupau made 25 appearances for Manly in the 2019 NRL season as the club qualified for the finals after finishing in sixth place. Taupau played in the club's elimination final victory over Cronulla and also featured in Manly's elimination final loss against South Sydney. On 10 December, Taupau signed a contract extension with Manly to remain at the club until the end of the 2022 season.

Working elaborate surfaces of wood and cardboard with varnish and other materials, he has created a very personal medium and artistic language. From an initially playful expressionism, his style has developed toward abstract expressionism and straightforward abstraction, and, more recently, a sort of minimalism in which an intimate dialogue between soul and memory, the spiritual and the sensual, poetry and dream-life can take place. His works have been exhibited throughout the world and are held by numerous important institutions, including the National Museum Reina Sof√≠a, the Galician Centre for Contemporary Art, the Madrid Museum of Contemporary Art and the Marugame Hirai Museum of Japan, as well as by many private collectors and foundations. Lamazares in Berlin, 2005 Biography=Early years: painting and poetry (Galicia, 1954‚Äì1977) Pieces from the series Sue√±o e colorao and Titania e BraoLamazares was born on January 2, 1954, in Maceira, a village in Lal√≠n (Pontevedra, Spain), whose rural environment left a deep impact on his imagery and creative process. Much of his early schooling (1963‚Äì1969) took place at the Franciscan seminary of Herb√≥n where he devoted himself to the study of literature, mostly Latin and Greek classics. In the late 1960s he began writing poetry and developed friendships with the writer √Ålvaro Cunqueiro and the painters Laxeiro and Manuel Pesqueira, who would become formative influences. As his creative vocation began to shift from poetry toward painting, he undertook lengthy travels throughout Europe (1972) to study in person work by the masters he revered, including, Paul Klee, Rembrandt and Joan Mir√≥, to whom would be added Antoni T√†pies, Manuel Millares, Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon, as well as Medieval art and the Art of Oceania. At the conclusion of his travels he stayed briefly in Barcelona, where he took a job as a construction worker, studying the works in its museums, particularly the collections of Romanesque art at the Mar√©s Museum and the National Art Museum of Catalonia in his free time. In Madrid, where he next alighted, he resumed contact with his maestro, Laxeiro, and got to know the poet Carlos Oroza, whose friendship would remain essential for him: the dialogue between painting and poetry is a constant in all of his work. In 1973, at the age of only 19, Lamazares had already begun exhibiting his paintings in group and solo shows. In 1975 he began his compulsory military service in the Navy, in Ferrol. On September 27 of that year he learned the startling news of the final executions by the Francoist government, following the Burgos Trial; one of the executed culprits was his friend Humberto Baena, a 24-year-old from Pontevedra. The news sank Lamazares into a deep depression, resulting in a period of psychiatric institutionalization. It was during this time that he would write his collection of poems, Adibal. From expressionism and Arte Povera to bifacial painting (Madrid-New York, 1978‚Äì1989) Mauro, from Gracias vagabundas, in the National Gallery of JordanIn 1978 Lamazares moved to Madrid, where he formed a close friendship with the painter Alfonso Fraile, as well as with the gallerist Juana Mord√≥, the art critic and poet Santiago Am√≥n and the neurologist Alberto Portera, the link to a large group of artists ‚Äìwriters, filmmakers, musicians and painters‚Äì who would meet on weekends at his country house in Mataborricos, where Lamazares would mount an open-air exhibition of his work in 1979. That same year he would meet Joan Mir√≥, and travel through Provence to acquaint himself with the landscape of Van Gogh, Picasso, C√©zanne or Matisse. The 1980s were a time of intense creative activity and broad diffusion of his work: by the age of 30, Lamazares had already carved out a space in the panorama of Spanish as well as international art. His paintings of the time show playful and dreamlike figures depicted in an expressionistic mode, intensely chromatic and powerfully original. He exhibited at Juana Mord√≥'s gallery in Madrid, at Elisabeth Frank's in Belgium and at the Sala Gaspar in Barcelona. Soon he moved to New York City, where he would remain for two years on a Fulbright Scholarship. There, his painting, which he exhibited at the Bruno Fachetti Gallery, developed in a direction at once purer and more material. For a period he divided his time between New York and Salamanca. In 1988 he traveled through Anatolia ‚Äìvisiting the temple of Didyma as a tribute to H√∂lderlin's Hyperion‚Äì and Istanbul, where he was deeply impressed by the Byzantine churches. Imagery reflecting his experience, articulated by the arrangement of wood in the paintings, can be seen in the work exhibited at Galer√≠a Miguel Marcos. In 1990 he began preparing a new series of works, designed to be looked at from both sides, which he calls bifrontes (bifacials). Sculptural painting and large formats (Paris-Madrid, 1990‚Äì2003) Ant√≥n Lamazares in his studioIn 1990 and 1991, Lamazares came to Paris on a stipend from the Cit√© des Arts, and in 1991 he opened a large studio in Madrid, where he began to work on the series Gracias vagabundas (Wandering Graces) and Desaz√≥n de vagabundos (The Anxiety of Vagabonds). In 1993 he met T√†pies and published an extensive interview with him subsequent to T√†pies having been awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale. Invited by the Galician Centre for Contemporary Art, he spent May to November 1996 in Galicia painting the series Gracias do lugar: Eidos de Rosal√≠a, Eidos de Bama (The place's charm: Rosal√≠a's fields, Bama‚Äôs fields). From June to November 1997 he worked outdoors in Santa Baia de Matalobos on B√©s de Santa Baia. That same year he became acquainted with the sculptor Jorge Oteiza, a lengthy conversation with whom is filmed by Chus Guti√©rrez. In 1998, in Madrid, he painted the series Titania e Brao, a tribute to the Castilian summer, and subsequently Pol en Adel√°n. During this time, he also created numerous graphic works, including a suite of etchings to accompany five texts by Gustavo Mart√≠n Garzo in the artist's book El Canto de la Cabeza (Galer√≠a Sen, Madrid) and the lithographs that accompany Itinerarium by Egeria (Rai√±a Lupa, Paris), a work that was nominated as book of the year by Le Monde Diplomatique. In 2001 he mounted a grand-scale exhibition at the Seaport of A Coru√±a, under the title Un saco de pan duro (A Bag of Hard Bread). His work was chosen for international promotion, along with that of other Spanish artists such as Antonio Saura, Mart√≠n Chirino, Joan Hern√°ndez Pijuan, Millares, Pablo Serrano, Oteiza and T√†pies by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under its program Spanish Art for the Outside World. Around this time Lamazares traveled to Florence and Assisi to examine works of Renaissance art as well as to gain familiarity with the milieu of Saint Francis, to whom he would dedicate his new series, Follente Bemil. From abstraction to poetic minimalism (Berlin, since 2004) Exhibition of Domus Omnia in Santiago de CompostelaIn 2004, Lamazares moved to Berlin where he has been living ever since. Following the death of his father he began the series E fai fr√≠o no lume (It‚Äôs Cold in the Fire). He was the subject of large exhibitions in Slovenia and in the Museum (Church) Kiscelli in Budapest (Hungary). Exhibition by Lamazares in New York, 2009Subsequently he devoted himself to the series Domus Omnia, and collaborated in the creation of two further artist's books by Oroza: Deseo sin tr√°mite (Aguatinta, Vigo) with a serigraph and Un sentimiento ingr√°vido recorre el ambiente (Rai√±a Lupa, Paris) to which he contributed five lithographs. In 2008 he exhibited Horizonte sin due√±o (Unowned Horizon) in the National Gallery of Jordan (Amman) and an anthology of his graphic work in the Cervantes Institute of Damascus (Syria), where the poet Taher Riyad dedicated the collection of poems Cantos de Lamazares to him. In 2009 he exhibited his work at the Queen Sof√≠a Spanish Institute in New York, as well as in Ourense (Spain), at the Cultural Centre of the Delegation. He also participated in a traveling exhibition dedicated to the poet Vicente Aleixandre and received the Laxeiro Prize honoring his life's work and its international renown. In 2010 he exhibited his work at the University Church, in Santiago de Compostela, and in Tui, where the documentary Horizonte sin due√±o, was screened at its international film festival Play-Doc. The film, directed by the siblings Nayra and Javier Sanz (Rinoceronte Films), presents a journey through the universe of painting, poetry and nature from the perspective of Ant√≥n Lamazares. On May 20, 2010, the University of Santiago de Compostela awarded him its Insignia de Oro (Golden Shield). This was the first time in six centuries that this honor was conferred upon an artist. On June 28, 2010, during a ceremony held at the Igrexa de San Domingos de Bonaval, the Xunta de Galicia, conferred upon him the Medalla Castelao, acknowledging \\"the perfection, the symbolism and the transcendency of the works\\" as a reflection of the devotion to and faith \\"in the culture, the history and the essence of a people.\\" See also *Abstract art *Expressionism *Minimalism *Contemporary art References=NotesBibliography *AM√ìN, Santiago, \\"La pintura de Lamazares y la luz crepuscular\\", Lamazares 1978-1986, A Coru√±a, Dur√°n, 1986. *CALVO SERRALLER, Francisco, \\"La musa en cueros\\", Madrid, Montenegro, 1986; \\"Casa de la pintura\\", Domus Omnia, Madrid, √Ålvaro Alc√°zar, 2007. *CASTRO, Fernando, \\"Fragmentos de un texto que no pude escribir\\", Ant√≥n Lamazares.

He exhibits his paintings in the United States and Europe. Many of Field's best-known artworks utilize the visual language of collage to bring a broad range of disparate images into a narrative scheme. His early work incorporated found objects and made use of popular imagery, referencing the transition period between Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art when artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Larry Rivers used both lyrical brush strokes and popular imagery in their work. Later, Field's paintings developed a more personal symbolism in which certain characters or objects appear more frequently. His current work is deeply symbolic and often contains references to classical mythology in addition to extensive personal symbolism. Field lives and maintains a studio in North Adams, Massachusetts. Life and work In 1973 Joshua Field was born in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts. He spent his formative years in St. Petersburg, Florida where he attended Gibbs High School and enrolled in the Pinellas County Center for the Arts, a competitive four-year magnet program for the arts that accepts students through portfolio and on-site skills review . This formed Field's classical foundation but also introduced him to the Proto-Pop period in American Art, a time when abstract expressionism clashed with the introduction of the found objects and assimilated commercial imagery of the pop movement. Florida's gulf coast is a haven for the proto-pop elite, including Robert Rauschenberg and James Rosenquist. Field later attended the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore where he expanded his education. At MICA, he focused on assemblage/collage and poetry, and was mentored by Joe Cardarelli, a renowned beat poet and friend of Allen Ginsberg, Andrei Codrescu, Anselm Hollo and Robert Creeley. Field connected readily with poetry as alternative narrative structures and an ideal analogue for narrative symbolic imagery. In 1996, Field moved back to the Berkshires. He currently maintains a studio in North Adams, Massachusetts, home to the largest contemporary art museum on the east coast, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. He has exhibited nationally and internationally, from Chelsea in New York City to Berlin, Germany. Field is known for poetically driven narrative paintings that are iconic, psychological and subversive. Arrays of archetypal imagery culled from both the collective consciousness and the realm of the intensely personal portray both sociological issues and mythic individual dramas.

He was an ardent follower of B. R. Ambedkar and was pioneer of the practice of exchanging the greeting Jai Bhim amongst the Dalits. He was also a prominent labour leader in the Central Province and was the general secretary of the Independent Labour Party in the province. Hardas was also the first MLA to be elected from Nagpur Kamptee constituency in 1937.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/filmmaker-nagdeve-wins- directors-award-at-dalit-film-fest-in-new-york/articleshow/68261785.cms Life Hardas born in a Mahar family at Kamthi on 6 January 1904. His father, Laxmanrao Nagrale, was a clerk in the Railway Department. He passed his matriculation from Patwardhan High School, Nagpur. He also studied Sanskrit with Swami Brahmanand of the Arya Samaj at Nagpur. Consistent with the social customs of that time, in 1920, aged 16, he married Sahubai. Social reformer At the age of 17, Hardas founded a weekly publication titled Maharatha, distributed from Nagpur with a view to spreading social awareness among the Dalits. He tried to organise the Mahar community by founding the Mahar Samaj organisation in 1922. He also formed one Mahar Samaj Pathak, a voluntary corps group, to bring together the disorganised Mahar youth to protect the Dalits against atrocities. He opened a Mahila Ashram in order to imparting training to Dalit women in daily activities. Also, in order to avoid exploitation of beedi workers, he started the beedi work on cooperative basis, which became very successful in the area. Hardas was a strong opponent of irrational and superstitious customs. He was strongly opposed to the sub-caste barriers amongst the depressed classes. He arranged annual community dinners that crossed these lines on the death anniversary of Chokhamela, a 14th-century saint from the Mahar community. He was against idol worship. He organised a meeting of his brethren in 1927 at Ramtek under the presidency of Kisan Faguji Bansod. At this meeting, Hardas exhorted his people to start idol worship at the temple of Ramtek and stop bathing in the dirty Ambada tank there. However, he sent a group of his followers under the leadership of Shankar Mukunda Bele to participate in the Kalaram Temple Entry Satyagraha led by B. R. Ambedkar on 2 March 1930. He argued that this was against inequality and not to worship idols. Hardas was also a strong advocate of education for Dalits. He himself had completed matriculation, which was then a rare thing for Dalits. He started night schools at Kamthi in 1927 at the behest of the Mahar community. There were 86 boys and 22 girls learning in his school at a time. He also started one Sant Chokhamela Library at Kamthi around the same time. Hardas was a prolific writer and mostly used his writing skills for creating social awareness in the depressed classes. He penned a book Mandal Mahatme in 1924 to create awareness amongst the people against the evils in society. He distributed free copies of this book among the people. This book created a significant impact on the people and the Dalit people in the area stopped watching and enjoying plays based on Hindu gods. He also wrote a play Veer Balak (Brave Child) and staged it to create a new wave of awareness among the people. He wrote and published Songs of the Market and Songs of the Hearth. His articles were also published in Weekly Janta, which was edited by Ambedkar. Political career Hardas met Dr. B. R. Ambedkar in 1928 for the first time. Though he started his social activities long back, his political career get a push with this meeting. In the same year,Dr. B. R. Ambedkar requested him to give his witness in front of Simon Commission. Later in year 1930-31, with regards to the Second Round Table Conference, when question arose about the real leadership of untouchables, Hardas sent a telegram to Ramsay MacDonald, the then prime minister of the United Kingdom, that Dr. B. R. Ambedkar is the real leader of untouchables and not Mahatma Gandhi. He also created an opinion about this in different parts of the country and sent a total of 32 telegrams to McDonald by various untouchable leaders. Like B. R. Ambedkar, Hardas wanted greater participation of the depressed classes in the legislative assemblies. He appealed the governor of Central Provinces and Berar to nominate members among the depressed classes to the legislative council, district local boards, and municipalities. He was among the main organisers of the Conference of the Depressed Classes at Nagpur on 8 August 1930 presided over by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. This conference passed the resolution to have separate electorates for the depressed classes. This conference formed All India Depressed Classes Federation and Hardas was elected as a joint secretary of the federation. The second conference of All India Depressed Classes was held at Kamthi on 7 May 1932 and Hardas was the president of its reception committee. At this meeting, he was elected as a secretary of the national body of the federation. Hardas became secretary of CP and Berar branch of Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1936. He fought the assembly elections in 1937 from Nagpur-Kamthi constituency and won., pp. 48-49, gives an interesting account of how Hardas won the election against a wealthy Indian National Congress candidate from the constituency. Hardas was forced, with the help of local goons, to take back his candidacy. In 1938, he was also nominated as the president of the CP and Berar branch of ILP. In 1939, he fell sick with tuberculosis and died on 12 January 1939. Legacy Hardas left a significant impact on the depressed classes even after his death. Moon notes that \\"Just as a comet appears, bringing light throughout the sky, and then vanishing in instant, so it happened with Hardas.\\" The greeting phrase Jai Bhim coined by him has become a general term of greeting amongst the Dalits in India. It is also a formal greeting phrase of Bahujan Samaj Party, a Dalit prominent and National Level party in India. Film depiction In 2016, producer Dhananjay Galani made a film titled Bole India Jai Bhim which portrayed the life and work of Hardas.

Chinese migrants to Pakistan have developed a distinct Pakistani-style Chinese cuisine. History Chinese cuisine in areas which today make up Pakistan has a history going back to restaurants established in the 1930s. One of these, the ABC Chinese Restaurant in Karachi, was once patronised by Zhou Enlai, and continued operating until 1988. Chinese restaurants are very popular amongst families as opposed to fast food and continental cuisine which is more favoured by the youth. Pakistani Chinese food resembles Cantonese cuisine with its liberal use of chicken stock-based sauces seasoned with soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, monosodium glutamate and oyster sauce, but very rarely any fresh herbs. It is also a common practice in restaurants to serve Chinese dishes in sizzling platters. Vegetables used in Chinese cuisine are mostly cabbage, capsicum and onion, since broccoli or bok choy are not native vegetables. The extent of the popularity of Chinese food can be estimated from the fact that Chinese variations of local dishes have become quite popular like Chinese samosa, Chinese broast, and Chinese pulao. Some newly opened restaurants like Ginsoy have been prospering in the city of Karachi. The food offered at Chinese restaurants in Karachi is a blend of Chinese cooking with Pakistani style influences.From Shanghai to Karachi: Living the Chinese dream, in the eyes of a diplomat More recently in Islamabad, the Phoenix restaurant has become well- known. Their clientele includes ex-president Pervez Musharraf and ex-prime minister Shaukat Aziz; Musharraf is said to enjoy their prawns, Peking duck, stir-fried beef, and garlic lamb chops.ÁåéËÆØÂÜõÊÉÖÁΩë: ‰∏≠È§êÈ¶ÜÂú®Â∑¥Âü∫ÊñØÂù¶ÂèóÈùíÁùêChina Central Television: Á©ÜÊ≤ôÊãâÂ§´Â∏∏Ëøõ‰∏≠È§êÈ¶ÜÁî®È§ê ‰πê‰∏∫ÊôÆÈÄöÈ£üÂÆ¢‰π∞Âçï Chicken Manchurian, one of the most popular Pakistani Chinese dishes, is an Indo-Chinese dish that normally consists of chicken with occasional vegetables in a spicy sauce.

Dishes pulao Amongst some of the most popular Pakistani-Chinese dishes are: * Chicken Manchurian - the most popular dish with pieces of stir fried chicken served in a red ketchup based sauce. It is normally served with egg or chicken fried rice. * Chicken with Lime - stir fried chicken served in a sizzling lemon and/or lime sauce. * Sweet and Sour Chicken or Prawns - meat, capsicum, onions and pineapple chunks with a red sweet and sour sauce. * Chinese rice - Basmati is the most common form of rice used. The most famous rice recipes are egg and chicken fried rice. * Chicken Honey Wings - Chicken wings dipped in a coating of sweet honey paste. * Chinese soup - Chicken corn soup and hot and sour soup are ubiquitous in restaurants, homes, and on TV. These are served with staples such as vinegar (sirka) and chili pepper. * Noodles - Chicken chowmein and chopsuey are popular. Their method of cooking employs hearty use of soy sauce, ajino moto, vinegar and chili sauce with vegetables, boneless chicken and/or Keema (minced meat).

C. Treves was elected as the first president of the RCSL, Podg√≥recki as the vice-president and Evan as the Secretary.http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro.htm The RCSL aimed at \\"opening up a broader range of opportunities for the participation of individual members in the activities of the Association in the field of sociology of law\\".The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf. The RCSL was initially formed as a largely informal forum to encourage and facilitate exchanges between sociologists of law from different countries. A board was created in 1968, formal by-laws were adopted in 1973, and regular election were organised once every fourth year.The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf. The RCSL also holds annual meetings, occasionally together with other similar associations such as the Law and Society Associations or the Socio-Legal Studies Association.See the editoria by Johannes Feest, on the 40th anniversary of RCSL in RCSL Newsletter, Summer Issue 2002. The annual meetings are often devoted to specific theoretical and methodological themes, but space is reserved for organising sessions on general topics. The selection of themes and the call for papers are the responsibility of the RCSL board and is carried out in cooperation with the local organising committee. The RCSL board encourages countries not represented by its board members to participate and to submit suggestions for organising its annual meetings. Since the late 1960s, RCSL has supported the formation of permanent working groups, which focus on various research areas such as comparative studies of legal professions, social and legal systems, comparative legal cultures, gender, law and politics, law and urban space, and family and human rights, in order to promote research in these areas. On 23 December 1988, the RCSL signed an agreement with government of the Basque Country creating the International Institute for the Sociology of Law in O√±ati which is located in the province of Guip√∫zcoa in the Basque Country in the north of Spain.See RCSL, 30 Years for the Sociology of Law, O√±ati, IISL, 1991.The University of O√±ati which houses the International Institute for the Sociology of Law. Since its establishment in 1962, the RCSL has contributed to the development of the sociology of law by systematically promoting social scientific research about law, legal institutions and legal systems.

A World-Wide Documentary Enquiry, Milano, Giuffr√©, 1990. Masayuki Murayama (Japan) is currently the president of the RCSL. Previous presidents include Vittorio Olgiati (Italy), Anne Boigeol (France), Lawrence Friedman (Stanford, USA), Johannes Feest (Bremen, Germany), Rogelio Perez Perdomo (IESA, Caracas, Venezuela), Mavis Maclean (Oxford, UK), Vincenzo Ferrari (Degli Studi Milano, Italy), Jean van Houtte (Belgian), Jan Glastra Van Loon (the Netherlands), and Renato Treves (Italy). Adam Podg√≥recki Prize In honour and memory of the lifetime achievements of Adam Podg√≥recki and his place in the history of RCSL, the board of RCSL established the annual RCSL Adam Podg√≥recki Prize at its meeting in 2004.

She is best known as a late night news presenter in various Philippine television news programs in different television networks. She became GMA Network's first female news presenter and pioneered its Public Affairs department during her term as GMA News executive. She later transferred to ABC-5 (eventually as TV5, now 5) to head its operations. When she left the company after five years, she led ABS-CBN's public service campaign against child abuse under the network's Bantay Bata social welfare program. Eventually, she became the anchor of ABS-CBN's late news program The World Tonight where she replaced Loren Legarda. Monz√≥n-Palma has received several awards including University of the Philippines Gawad Plaridel in 2017. Early life Monz√≥n-Palma was born Manila to Andres Monz√≥n and Priscilla Mapa and they lived in Malate district of Manila. She has five brothers and a sister. She studied at Malate Catholic School for her elementary and high school education. She went to college at Saint Scholastica's College and took up Bachelor of Arts in Education. She also cross-enrolled to De La Salle College for her other subjects. Career=Early radio and television programs During her freshman years at Saint Scholastica's College, Monz√≥n- Palma was already doing anchoring works for The Manila Times' radio station DZMT hosting the radio program Times Tower Revue. She later transferred to another radio station, DZHP, and teamed up with other known broadcast journalists such as Bong Lapira and Jos√© Mari U. V√©lez. Eventually, during Martial Law in the Philippines as declared by Ferdinand Marcos in the early 1970s, she became a weather news presenter and children's television show host at the government run television station, then named National Media Production Center. GMA Network and PTV-4 In 1976, she transferred to GMA Network to become its first female news presenter at age 25. She first anchored News at Seven, then The 11:30 Report and later GMA Headline News. She was also one of the former hosts of the longest-running public service program Kapwa Ko Mahal Ko, which she left the program a year later. Monz√≥n-Palma was one of the personalities who went to Channel 4 (then named as Maharlika Broadcasting System), the Philippine government's television station that was then captured by forces linked to the People Power Revolution. After the People Power Revolution, then President Corazon Aquino assigned Monz√≥n-Palma and Jos√© Mari V√©lez to manage Channel 4, which was renamed to People's Television Network (PTV-4). After a few months, she returned to GMA and anchored the late night news with Velez. She eventually became the senior vice president for GMA News and Public Affairs and pioneered its public affairs department. Monz√≥n-Palma left GMA Network in 1992 after a mistake she made during a news broadcast. She erroneously reported in live television that Maureen Hultman, a shooting victim, already died but in fact, Hultman was still in a comatose state. Days after the incident, she did not go to work and she eventually resigned, taking responsibility for the inaccurate report. She also apologized to the Hultmans for the error she committed. ABC and ABS-CBN After one-month hiatus, Monz√≥n-Palma moved to the reopened ABC-5 (later renamed to TV5, now 5) and became its chief operating officer. As its executive, she was no longer involved in the daily newsroom routine but she still presented The Big News with Eric Eloriaga and Kathy Tanco Ong as her co-anchors. She stayed for five years on ABC-5 and then, took a break in the limelight in May 1997. In October of that same year, she was tapped by Gina Lopez of ABS-CBN to become the program director of Bantay Bata 163, the public service campaign of ABS-CBN Foundation, Inc. (later to be known as ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya Foundation) against child abuse. When then The World Tonight news anchor Loren Legarda decided to run for a seat in the Philippine Senate, Monz√≥n-Palma was asked by ABS-CBN to take Legarda's place. She agreed while still doing her work at Bantay Bata. In 1999, when most programs in English steadily came to an end on free television, The World Tonight was moved to ABS-CBN News Channel and Monz√≥n-Palma continued to be its news presenter together with co-anchor Angelo Castro Jr. Monz√≥n-Palma also hosted Talkback, a current affairs television program. She also did radio at ABS-CBN's AM radio station, DZMM, through her radio program Paksa, which discusses subjects such as women, labor rights, welfare of children, and the \\"militant poor\\". She became program director of Sagip Kapamilya after handling Bantay Bata. She would later gave up her duties in Sagip Kapamilya but still continued her work as broadcast journalist in ABS-CBN.  Other ventures  Aside from being a media practitioner and executive, she is also the director of the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR), a private non-profit and non-stock company. During her early life as a news reporter, Monzon-Palma was involved with civic organizations such as the Quezon City Red Cross and the Citizens Traffic Action.Paras-Sison, Carla and Christelle Belmonte.

The genus Ephestia is closely related to Cadra and might be its senior synonym. Several of these moths are variously assigned to one or the other genus, in particular in non-entomological sources. Cadra and Ephestia belong to the huge snout moth subfamily Phycitinae, and therein to the tribe Phycitini. Cadra species can usually be recognized by their reduced forewing venation: veins 4, 7 and 9 are missing, making for a total of nine veins in the forewing. Some members of this genus are significant pests of dry plant produce, such as seeds and nuts.

C. Bagchi was one of the most notable Sino -Indologists of the 20th century. He was the third Upacharya (Vice-Chancellor) of Visva-Bharati University. Early life and education He was born on 18 November 1898, the eldest son of Shri Harinath Bagchi and Smt Tarangini Devi in present-day Bangladesh in Magura District. He was to lose his mother in his early childhood. He did his schooling in Srikole, Magura District‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÄ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶≤ ‡¶á‡¶â‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶® in present Bangladesh. Dr Bagchi was a brilliant student and a favourite of his teachers and Head Master who expected great things of him. In 1914, he appeared for the Matriculation examination. He graduated from Krishnagar Government College in 1918 with honours in Sanskrit. He stood first in his college and received the prestigious Mohini Mohan Roy award. Although he showed promise in Mathematics, he took Sanskrit, the classical language of India, because of his desire to study ancient Indian history. He joined Calcutta University for his post- graduation studies in Ancient History and Culture, obtaining a First Class M.A. in 1920. He was awarded a Gold Medal in the Religion Section and overall had stood first in the University. Academic career and contributions After his post-graduation from Calcutta University, he immediately joined the University as a Lecturer after being called by Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee who told him to \\"Join from tomorrow\\" (In Bengali, as noted in his personal diary). The period from 1921 onwards was highly significant for Prabodh Chandra Bagchi in fulfilling his dream to become a true Orientalist. He realised the need for reconstructing ancient history and the multifaceted Indian cultural history more scientifically on a broader Asiatic perspective. With this lofty dream in mind, he started learning Chinese and Japanese from Professor Kimura and Professor Masuda of Calcutta University and German from Professor Taraporewala. Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, the Vice-Chancellor deputed Prabodh Chandra to learn Chinese and Tibetan from Sylvain L√©vi, the Professor of Sanskrit and Indian Civilization in the Sorbonne University, Paris who was in Santiniketan on an invitation from Rabindranath Tagore. It was also from Sylvain L√©vi and the great poet Rabindranath that Prabodh Chandra imbibed a new approach to research on the Indian cultural history which renewed his endeavour to learn various foreign languages to have access to the original source materials. Instead of fragmented specialised studies he realised that ancient Indian history and culture should be viewed in its entirety so that many obscure areas would be brought into light. In 1922, young Prabodh reached the first milestone of his career, when he accompanied Sylvain L√©vi and Madame L√©vi to Nepal. His painstaking work in exploring original manuscripts and the Tibetan and Chinese manuscripts of old Sanskrit texts which were lost in their originals but preserved in their translations at the Royal Durbar Library of Nepal resulted in his invaluable findings in the domain of Indological research. Among his findings the palm leaf manuscripts of Kaula-Jnana- Nirnaya and Sammoho Tantra need special mention as they throw light on mysticism, influence of Sakti-ism on later Buddhism and emergence of new religious creeds. In 1922, Prabodh reached another milestone when he was awarded Rashbehari Ghosh Travelling Fellowship for one year. He travelled to Indo- China, Cambodia, Cochin-China and Japan. He got the opportunity to work with Sylvain L√©vi, Louis Finot, the founder of Ecole de Pali in Phnom Penh, George Groslier who established a renowned museum in Phnom Penh, National Museum of Cambodia, Henry Marshal, the head of Ecole Francaise d' extreme orient in Hanoi and Henri Permentier exponent of Khmer art and culture. Prabodh Chandra was enriched with their exploratory survey of the archaeological remains of Angkor Vat. He stayed in Hanoi and was fortunate to attend Chinese classes conducted by Prof. Auroussean. He visited Japan and benefited extensively from his stay at the Monastery of Koyasen. During the period between 1923 and 1926 Prabodh Chandra was in France on a government scholarship for higher studies. He worked * on Sanskrit Buddhist literature with Sylvain L√©vi, * on the ancient remains of Indian civilisation in Central Asia with Paul Pelliot, * on Buddhist literature in China with Henri Maspero, * on the ancient Pali texts with Jules Bloch and * on Avestan gathas with Antoine Meillet. He was awarded the highest degree of Docteur es Letters (State Doctorate) by the Paris University. Prabodh Chandra Bagchi served the department of Ancient History and Culture of Calcutta University during the period between 1926 and 1944. He contributed immensely to the enhancement of the research studies on Humanities with his innumerable writings based on his own findings. In 1929 and 1930 he was sent to Nepal again to carry on his research from the Chinese and Tibetan manuscripts on Tantrik Buddhism(Vajrayana), Buddhist Siddhacharyas and Charyagiti(Charyapada) and Dohakosa (Dohakosa of Tillopada and Sarahapada). In 1931, he along with Professors Suniti Kumar Chatterjee and Sukumar Sen formed an informal Study Circle at the Calcutta University for various deliberations on the discipline of historical linguistics which was known as the science of comparative philology. Subsequently in the year 1938 this Philological Society merged with the Indian Linguistic Society with Dr. Sukumar Sen as its Secretary and Dr. Bagchi as its Treasurer. Prabodh Chandra's residence at Ballygunge Place, Kolkata became a hub of cultural and intellectual activities. Parichayagosthi, an association of eminent literary persons like Hiran Kumar Sanyal, Bishnu Dey, Sudhin Datta and others had their gatherings at Prabodh's residence. Sarojini Naidu attended this gathering, Pramatha Nath Chowdhury was a frequent visitor and was extremely fond of Prabodh Chandra Bagchi. He presided over a number of conferences like Howrah Teachers' Conference and Divya Memorial Conference at Rangpur in 1937, Brihattara Banga Sahitya Sammelan(Greater Bengali Literary Conference) held in Guwahati, Assam and at Rangoon, Burma in 1939, Indian History Congress at Aligarh, All India Oriental Conference ( section of Pali and Buddhism) in Nagpur in 1946. Prabodh Chandra, who already established himself as an exponent in Sinology joined Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan as Director of Research Studies under the Chinese Cultural Studies Scheme on a special grant from the Chinese Government in the year 1945. He was still on deputation from Calcutta University. In the meantime, the government of India created a Chair Professorship at Peking University to promote Sino-Indian understanding and cultural ties and Prabodh Chandra was selected for this prestigious post for a period of two years. He fulfilled his new assignment successfully and his house at 41\\\\M Legation Street in Peking became a hub of Indo-Chinese cultural activities. An international conference (23‚Äì24 November 2008) was held in Beijing to commemorate the 110th birth anniversary of Professors Prabodh Chandra Bagchi and Tan Yunshan by remembering their scholarly contribution to Sino-Indian studies. At this international Conference which was inaugurated by Mrs.Nirupama Rao, then the Ambassador to China. A book on the collection of articles written by Prabodh Chandra was also released (India and China: Interactions through Buddhism and Diplomacy). On his return from China he resumed his work at Visva Bharati and took charge of Vidya Bhavana, the department of higher studies. In recognition of his valuable contributions to Oriental Studies he was awarded the Honorary Diploma by Ecole Francaise d' Extreme Orient. Between 1949 and 1951 P.C.Bagchi delivered a series of lectures at Jadavpur, Calcutta University as its Hemchandra Basu Mallik Professor. These highly illuminating lectures were on * the nomadic movements in early Central Asia * the history of the relations between Tokharistan and Eastern Iran * the history of the early states in the oases of Chinese Turkestan * the uses of the Indian scripts and languages in Central Asia These lectures were compiled into a book entitled \\"India and Central Asia\\" and published by Jadavpur, National Council of Education in 1955. To quote Professor B.N.Mukherjee, an eminent Orientalist evaluating this book and Bagchi's profound scholarship in the Centenary Volume \\"...he (Bagchi) was the first competent Indian scholar to delve into the past of Central Asia. He will always adorn a niche in the facade of Indo-Central Asian scholarship.\\"In 1952 he was sent to China as a delegate of the first Indian cultural delegation from independent India, led by Smt. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. Visva Bharati and his untimely death Bagchi had been involved with Visva-Bharati University since 1945 and had taken charge of Vidya Bhavana, the department of higher studies. He was appointed Vice ‚Äì Chancellor (Upacharya) of Visva Bharati University in April 1954. As a recognition of his contribution to academics Bagchi, became the first full Vice-Chancellor from outside the Tagore family. This was short-lived tenure as he died on 19 January 1956 after a heart attack. Pandit Nehru speaking at the convocation at the Visva Bharati. Dr PC Bagchi, Vice-Chancellor is seated in the left lower side of the picture. Despite his brief term of office, he proved to be an able administrator. The all round growth of Visva Bharati in keeping with the ideals of its founder, the great poet Rabindranath Tagore became his main thrust. He expanded spheres of activities in all the departments and introduced the three years' degree course in the graduation level with many other related changes in the curricula. To make Visva Bharati a centre of studies of Eastern Humanities he reorganised the Department of Indology and created higher posts of professorship in the Indo-Tibetan and Japanese Departments. The encouragement given to research by him despite institutional financial constraints was highly commendable. He personally used to guide the research students and make arrangements for their publication. He used to edit personally the Quarterly journals like Sino-Indian Studies, Visva Bharati Annals and Sahitya Prakashika. He introduced many new technical subjects like Applied Mechanics, Metal work etc. in the curricula of Siksha Shatra, the nucleus of Sriniketan. To quote Prabodh Chandra:\\" Through sustained contacts with Sriniketan I have now arrived at the firm conclusion that without Sriniketan, Santiniketan is incomplete. If Sriniketan is kept aloof from Santiniketan then we could not live up to the ideals of Gurudeva.\\" Bagchi kept up his prolific academic work during his tenure as Vice-Chancellor. In 1954, P.C.Bagchi delivered a series of scholarly lectures in memory of Adhar Chandra Mukherjee at the Calcutta University on the obscure field of India and South East Asia. In the same year P.C.Bagchi was invited by the Government of India to lead a cultural delegation to China which he declined due to his preoccupation with the administrative work of Visva-Bharati. Even whilst carrying out his administrative duties as Vice-Chancellor and despite his failing health, Bagchi carried out his research work late into the night. Many unfinished works were found on his study table after his sudden death. Out of these, only She-Kia-Fang-Che was posthumously published by the Visva-Bharati University in 1959. This treatise, translated from old Chinese into English for the first time by P.C.Bagchi, was written by Tao-Siuan, a disciple of the famous Chinese monk and pilgrim Xuanzang (Hiuen-Tsang) who lived between A.D.596 and 667. This book is of immense value as one of the major sources of our knowledge about the ancient geography, prevailing Buddhism and the travel account of Xuanzang. To quote Professor B. N. Mukherjee \\"Though published without any critical introduction or notes, obviously due to the translator's sudden and unexpected demise in course of the preparation of the publication, the translation may be included among Professor Bagchi's greatest contribution to the study of Central Asia.\\" Centenary Volume India and Asia. Prabodh Chandra's sudden demise was a great shock for Visva Bharati and the educational fraternity. Visva Bharati wrote in its news: \\"Dr.Bagchi's earthly pilgrimage is over. His name and fame now belong to history. Although this is an irreparable loss, we shall be proud to recollect that he was our own...A man of letters, he will certainly live more than his years.\\" The Ministry of Education, Government of India resolved: \\"This meeting...the Ministry of Education in the Government of India places on record its deep sense of loss at the untimely and sudden passing away of Dr.P.C.Bagchi, Vice-Chancellor, Visva Bharati, Santiniketan. Dr. Bagchi's death is a loss not only to Visva Bharati with which he was connected over a period of years, but to the cause of scholarship throughout the country. In him the nation has lost a distinguished scholar, Indologist, Sinologist and a worker who strived steadfastly for the ideals of Satyam, Shivam and Sundaram, which have been the motto of the university since its inception.\\" What stood out in his scholarship was his holistic approach to his research and indeed, to his life. Personal life In 1921, he married Panna Rani Devi, the daughter of Rai Saheb Taraknath Moitra and Hemangini Devi from Pabna. She was a great pillar of support, sharing in every aspect of his scholarly life and, running the family when he was away on his long foreign travels, exploratory field trips or lost in his remarkable library of rare and invaluable books into which he would delve for hours or when he was busy typing out his observations, the staccato from his Remington type writer a familiar sound in the household. She was known for her hospitality and tender nature and was very popular with his colleagues, students and friends. They had a son (Pratip) and five daughters (Chitra, Krishna,Gopa, Ratna, Indrani). He had five grandsons (Deepak Sinha, Ashok Sinha, Devdatta Mukutmoni, Dipankar Mukutmoni and Shiladitya Sinha) and two granddaughters (Sujata (Bulu) Sanyal and Sudeshna Sinha). Prabodh Chandra Bagchi was a man of sensitivity which is evident from his love for animals, music, aesthetics and refined life style. His compassion for the have-nots knew no bounds. He used to contribute a considerable amount every month from his own salary as scholarships to the needy yet deserving students. Bagchi the patriot Whilst at Paris, the young Bagchi also made his mark as an effective organiser He was one of the founders of \\"Association des Etudiante Hindous de France (Association of Indian Students of France). Forever sympathetic, he was loved by all Indian students and whenever required, he was ready to extend his helping hand. The well known scientist, Satyendra Nath Bose personally benefited from an introductory letter to Madame Marie Curie by Prof. Sylvain L√©vi at the request of Bagchi. Satyendra Nath Bose has given an illuminating account of the significant role played by the young Bagchi, a man of 'exemplary integrity' in a chapter in his Bengali compilation of essays. This organisation under the guidance of Prabodh Chandra gave shelter to the Indian freedom fighters who were branded as anti-government by the British authorities. The Association was involved in revolutionary activities with its branches in various European cities and its headquarters at 17, Rue de Sommerard in Paris. Even early in his life, during his post-graduate studies, he was actively associated with the Anushilan Samity, an organisation to trigger nationalistic activities. This was founded in Dacca by Barrister P. Mitra on whom Vivekananda made an indelible impact. Later on, this organisation was transferred to Calcutta. Some eminent students Dr Bagchi left behind a rich legacy through several of his students who went on to gain pre-eminence in their field. Some are listed here: * Pratap Chandra Chunder- a prominent educationist, he became Union Minister of Education in the Morarji Desai Ministry * Prof Dilip Kumar Biswas, former president of The Asiatic Society * Prof Biswanath Bannerjee, former president of The Asiatic Society * Emeritus Prof Kalyan Kumar Sarkar, Windsor University, Ontario, Canada * Prof Narayan Sen, noted Sinologist * Prof Biswadeb Mukherjee noted Sinologist specialising in Chinese Buddhism Centenary year commemoration Dr Bagchi's immense contribution to his field was highlighted with Centenary Celebrations at * Visva-Bharati University ‚Äì a souvenir edited by Prof. Dilip Kumar Ganguly was published * Ancient Indian History Department, Calcutta University * Indian Museum, Kolkata ‚Äì a book titled Tribute to PC Bagchi: Prabodhochandradaya was published edited by Prof Shyamal Kanti Chakravarty * The Asiatic Society, Kolkata ‚Äì a book titled Contributions of PC Bagchi on IndoTibetology edited by Prof Haraprasad Ray (, ), * National Library of India, Kolkata with an excellent exhibition * Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi, Kolkata ‚Äì Prabodh Chandra Bagchi a biography written by Ratna Sinha, Prof Kalyan Kumar Sarkar, Prof Suniti Pathak, Prof Haraprasad Ray and, Prof BN Mukherjee was published alongside Prabandha Samgraha (a collection of essays) by Probodhchandra Bagchi ()edited by Prof Jyoti Bhusan Chaki. *India and Asia: PC Bagchi Centenary Volume edited by Prof BN Mukherjee, published by Progressive Publishers in 2009 () Works He published a large number of books in English, French and Bengali.

Marang Centre was inaugurated as an academic centre in October 2005, following substantial sponsorship from the Standard Bank of South Africa, which continues to be the major sponsor of the centre. The centre occupies part of the Education Campus, formerly the campus of the Johannesburg College of Education in the Parktown section of Johannesburg next to the School of Medical and Health Sciences. Marang means light, sunbeam and illumination in Setswana, one of the official languages of South Africa. The Marang Centre is organised into research and development thrusts as shown below. These thrusts are the driving forces behind Marang's innovative and unique pre-service and in-service mathematics and science teacher education and preparation programmes. In addition to South African undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate future science and mathematics teachers, would-be teachers and teacher educators come from Southern African Development Community (SADC) member nations such as Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi', Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and other African countries.

Subsequent directors are Prof. Jill Adler, Prof. Marissa Rollnick, Prof. Anthony Lelliott and Prof. Craig Pournara (current). Notable Programs=BSc Honours in Mathematics & Science EducationMSc in Mathematics & Science Education=Organization of Research Thrusts=Effective Teaching of Mathematics & ScienceMathematics Literacy The Mathematical Literacy thrust was established in 2005 - just prior to the introduction of Mathematical Literacy as a new subject in the post-compulsory phase in 2006. Mathematical Literacy is focused on developing the skills and competences needed to deal with the mathematical aspects of everyday life - as a citizen and a worker. The thrust focuses on research and teacher development in Mathematical Literacy, alongside building post-graduate research attention in this area. Several research publicationsVenkatakrishnan, H. & Graven, M. (2006) Mathematical Literacy in South Africa and Functional Mathematics in England: A consideration of overlaps and contrasts, Pythagoras, 64, 14-28.Venkat, H.

Charlotte, N.C.: Information Age Publishing . have been produced since the thrust's launch and thrust participants have contributed to national policy debates around the new subject, taking a critical advocacy position. Subject Matters for Teaching Mathematics & Science This thrust has both research and development aims, and complementary foci across the mathematics and science projects. The research aims are to contribute to scientific knowledge on the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô and ‚Äòhow‚Äô of mathematics and science knowledge for teaching through substantive, ongoing research. This thrust focuses on pedagogic content knowledge and aims to carry out investigations into how subject experts, current and future educators, develop their Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), and ways of capturing and portraying their use of PCK through case studies. The idea is to explore a number of issues such as models that are useful for describing and analysing teachers‚Äô PCK, the resources and artifacts that educators employ, and the extent to which disciplinary knowledge is context bound. In the research thrust we will carry out interventions to find out if an awareness of PCK will assist educators in preparing to teach unfamiliar content areas, such as those proposed for the new South African (2005 National Curriculum Statement) curriculum. The development aims are to improve mathematics and science teachers‚Äô competence in teaching science by enhancing their flexibility with their content knowledge. Teaching Math & Science in Multilingual Classroom The aim is to deepen the knowledge base of mathematics education research, policy and practice in the area of language and mathematics learning and teaching by developing appropriate/relevant pedagogies for teaching and learning mathematics in multilingual contexts. More specifically the idea is to develop best practices in multilingual classrooms that pay attention to how learners‚Äô language facilities are drawn on and strengthened in mathematics. The thrust focuses on the relationship between language and mathematics. The work of the thrust has implications for mathematics teaching, teacher education and policy. Science Awareness, Informal Learning & Schools (SAILS) The main research aim is to provide baseline knowledge about how science informal learning institutions in South Africa can be best utilized to promote science awareness and learning. The development aims are to develop teachers in order for them to use learning opportunities outside the classroom as effectively as possible. In addition, science awareness in the general public will be developed by running events of interest such as ‚ÄòStar Parties‚Äô, piloting ‚ÄòCaf√© Scientifique‚Äô and other activities. Furthermore, the thrust develops teachers‚Äô knowledge in areas that deal with relevant issues of science technology and society such as climate change and biotechnology with the hope that they will impart scientific awareness among their school learners. Primary MathematicsTechnology in the Teaching & Learning of Mathematics This thrust promotes the use of technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The thrust provides opportunities for in-service teachers to deepen and broaden their knowledge of key mathematical concepts, as well as reflect on and implement applications of technology to their teaching of mathematics. For research, the thrust aims at investigating technology-based tasks that promote mathematical learning among in-service teachers and their students.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The German American Heritage Center was incorporated in 1994, and the board of directors purchased the Standard Hotel on the Davenport riverfront in 1995. The building was built by John Brus and opened in 1862 as the Germania House, a gasthaus (guest house), for immigrants. In 1876 it was bought by John Frederick Miller and renamed the Miller Hotel. He was a German immigrant who had been a manufacturer in the city since the 1850s. Miller also operated the restaurant, billiard room and saloon in the hotel until 1889. The hotel was used at this time by Scott County farmers when they came to Davenport. with The hotel's name was changed several times in the 20th-century. It became the Arcade Hotel around 1906, the Henry Blessing Boarding House around 1917, and the Standard Hotel from 1924 to 1995. The retail space on the main floor was occupied by various tenants over the years. In 1983, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1996. In 2009, extensive renovations to the center were completed with enhanced multimedia and exhibit spaces. Architecture The building is a fine example of high Victorian commercial architecture in Davenport. Of particular merit is the metal cornice that was apparently added by John Miller, whose name appears on it. The original storefronts had been removed and were restored in the 2009 renovation. The easternmost bay, where the hotel's main entrance was located, is more decorative than the other six and is below the cornice arch.

The game was released on February 22, 2011 in North America and on February 25, 2011 in Europe. The game is distinguished by its sense of style and crass humor as well as excessive violence and profanity, rewarding players with points for performing increasingly ludicrous and creative kills. Bulletstorm does not have any competitive multiplayer modes, preferring instead to include cooperative online play as well as score attack modes. Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics who praised the game's voice acting, characters, graphics, action, soundtrack, humor and storyline, but has amassed a great deal of controversy following its release. Bulletstorm was a commercial failure for both Epic Games and Electronic Arts. A remastered version, Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition published by Gearbox Software, was released on April 7, 2017 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A Nintendo Switch version, with all previous DLC included, titled Bulletstorm: Duke of Switch Edition was released on August 30, 2019. Plot Bulletstorm takes place in the 26th century, where the universe is run by the Confederation of Planets. Grayson Hunt (Steven Blum) is the leader of Dead Echo, a black ops team under command of Star General Earl Sarrano (Anthony De Longis). Following Sarrano's orders and assassinating alleged criminals, Dead Echo kills a man known as Bryce Novak. Immediately after, they discover Novak was a civilian reporter, documenting civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo. Realizing they have been tricked by Sarrano, Grayson and his team desert and become space pirates on the run from Sarrano's forces. Ten years later, Grayson commands a ship with his old teammates, Ishi Sato (Andrew Kishino), Rell Julian (Chris Cox), and Dr. Whit Oliver (Robin Atkin Downes). He spots Sarrano's battlecruiser, the Ulysses near the planet of Stygia. In a drunken rage, he attacks and rams the Ulysses. The ships collide and crash land on the surface of Stygia, fatally wounding Ishi. To save Ishi, Grayson and Rell leave the ship to find an energy cell for the ship's medical equipment. On the planet, a former popular tropical-like resort, the population and wildlife have mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous bandits, respectively. Grayson reaches one of the Ulysses escape pods, and retrieves the pod's energy cell, and a device called an \\"instinct leash.\\" The leash provides him with strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills. Grayson and Rell return with the energy cell, and Doc begins replacing several of Ishi's body parts with cybernetics, including an AI processor for parts of his brain. In the middle of the operation, the bandits attack their ship, killing Doc, Rell, and leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg. Grayson and Ishi decide to work together to get off the planet, despite Ishi's disapproval of Grayson's thirst for revenge. Throughout the game, the AI processor in Ishi's brain takes over several times, fueled by his anger at Grayson's selfish and reckless actions which killed their teammates and put them in danger. The instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod, where they find Trishka (Jennifer Hale), a Final Echo soldier. She agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi under the condition that they rescue Sarrano. As they battle through the ravaged city, Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a training ground. The instinct leash is a means of ranking the user. Only by scoring kills can the soldier get more ammunition and supplies to survive. Upon learning that Trishka was Novak's daughter, Grayson tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her father's death, but lies about his involvement. The three fight their way to Sarrano's escape pod, which landed on a skyscraper. Trishka accuses Sarrano of her father's death, but he pushes her off the building. Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi of an armed \\"DNA bomb\\" on the Ulysses that will wipe out all life on the planet. He urges them to disarm it as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. As they travel to the Ulysses, Sarrano explains that prison convicts were used as the labor force to maintain the planet. They rebelled when toxic byproducts, created by the planet's solar radiation shields, were dumped in the underground prison. The convicts destroyed the shields, exposing the entire population to mutating radiation. Aboard the Ulysses, Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi into arming what was actually an inert bomb, and leaves. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by Trishka, who survived the fall. The three race to Sarrano's rescue ship and get on board. They fight through Sarrano's elite troops and eventually confront him. Trishka demands to know who killed her father, and Sarrano reveals Grayson's squad carried out the order. As the heroes argue, Sarrano hijacks Ishi's computer systems and forces Ishi to turn on his friends. Grayson manages to break Sarrano's control, and Ishi sacrifices himself to save his teammate. Enraged, Grayson impales Sarrano on the debris sticking out of the wall. Sarrano, still alive, ejects Grayson and Trishka out of the rescue ship. Grayson and Trishka race back to the Ulysses and board an unused escape pod. They launch it into low orbit, then the explosion of the DNA bomb propels the pod into space. Inside the pod, the two talk about Grayson's revenge, the loss of his team, and Sarrano's escape. Trishka asks Grayson what he is going to do about Sarrano escaping, and the screen fades to black. In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that Sarrano was revived as a cyborg. Ishi also survives and is now taken over by the AI processor. Gameplay Screenshot of the \\"skillshot\\" system As a first-person shooter, Bulletstorm focuses on combat. There are a variety of fictional firearms available, each with distinct behavior, from a pistol to a cannon that shoots a bolas weighted by grenades. Each weapon has an \\"alternate fire\\" mode which uses \\"charges\\"; for example, the assault rifle's \\"charge shot\\" is a single volley of bullets that destroy almost everything in its path. Much of the story and gameplay puts focus on the \\"energy leash\\", a rope of energy projected from a device on Grayson's left hand. The leash allows him to pull enemies towards him, activate certain devices and traps, and slam down a ball of energy that launches all nearby enemies into the air. The player can also kick enemies or run and slide into them. If an enemy is launched into the air from the whip or by being kicked/slid into, he goes into slow motion, allowing players to perform skillshots. \\"Skillshot\\" is one of the game's unique features in which it rewards the player for killing opponents in the most creative and destructive ways possible. Points are rewarded by various actions, such as killing enemies in midair, making use of environmental hazards or utilizing a weapon's distinct feature. The more complicated or unusual the skillshot, the more points players acquire. Points are used as currency at \\"dropkits\\" scattered across the planet to purchase firearms, ammunition and upgrades. The dropkits include a shop, a skillshot checklist, and gameplay statistics. The player can carry up to three firearms, the assault rifle is the default one and is always carried. Bulletstorm uses a recharging health system, in which damage to the player is reflected by the screen turning red, and the player quickly returns to full health when not taking damage. Development Development began in June 2007. In 2008, Electronic Arts announced that it would be publishing a new IP from independent game developer Epic Games. A trademark for the name \\"Bulletstorm\\" was revealed when game developer People Can Fly filed a trademark for the name in December 2009. Epic Games designer Cliff Bleszinski was originally scheduled to announce the game alongside Gears of War 3 during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on April 8, 2010. However, his appearance was delayed to April 12, 2010 after his slot was taken by pop singer Justin Bieber. Soon after Bleszinski announced on social networking website Twitter that he would be announcing two games on the show on April 12, 2010. However, the game was revealed before the scheduled appearance when gaming magazine Game Informer released its May 2010 issue which revealed the game on its cover. On December 17, 2010, two months prior to its release, Epic Games announced that there would be a limited edition for Bulletstorm exclusively for Xbox 360 known as the Epic Edition. The Epic Edition includes bonus in- game content for Bulletstorm when playing online, including 25,000 experience points, visual upgrades for the leash, Peace Maker Carbine, boots and armor as well as access to the multiplayer beta of Gears of War 3. On January 14, 2011, Electronic Arts announced that a demo of the game would be available on January 25, 2011 for the Xbox 360 and on January 26, 2011 for the PlayStation 3. No demo was announced to be planned for the PC, which was described as odd by some reviewers, especially for an unproven video game franchise. It was remarked that Mark Rein, vice president and co-founder of Epic Games, previously described Bulletstorm as \\"a full-blown, oh-my-god amazing PC game\\". Following this announcement, Cliff Bleszinski, producer for the game, wrote a tweet on January 14, 2011 about how the demo was only for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which was considered by game reviewers as a way of making fun of PC players. Both Mark Rein and the official developer blog later stated that a PC demo would still happen. The PC demo was finally released on April 4 on Steam and Games for Windows ‚Äì Live, and featured the same level as the console versions. On January 30, 2011, Destructoid discovered that the Electronic Arts disclosure page for the game announced that a permanent internet connection was required to play. Adrian Chmielarz, a designer at People Can Fly, denied it on his Twitter page. Remastered version Materials provided by Microsoft to the press ahead of the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 in June of that year included images that were claimed by the press of Bulletstorm with improved graphics, though Microsoft declined to comment, nor was any announcement of the game made at that time. The remastered version was revealed during The Game Awards 2016 in December. Entitled the \\"Full Clip Edition\\" and being published by Gearbox Publishing, the remastered version was released on April 7, 2017 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It increased texture resolution and included support for 4K resolutions on Windows and PlayStation 4 Pro, and included additional content created by People Can Fly. This includes the Overkill Campaign Mode, which starts the players with access to all the game's weapons, and six new Echo maps. Those who pre-ordered the game received access to the Duke Nukem's Bulletstorm Tour downloadable content, allowing players to play as Duke Nukem with new voice lines recorded by Jon St. John. Gearbox' Randy Pitchford explained that the remastered version was not a free update for those that already owned the game on Windows, as the license was still held with Electronic Arts and they only secured the rights to help People Can Fly create the remaster, in addition to issues in transitioning from the discontinued Games for Windows Live platform. Marketing In January 2011, a viral video for Bulletstorm was released, parodying the Halo 3 \\"Believe\\" diorama. Television advertisements were aired on major networks such as Spike TV and Adult Swim. This was followed up in February with the release of Duty Calls, a free downloadable PC game that parodies the Call of Duty series, as well as general first-person shooter clich√©s. Film director John Stalberg, Jr. was hired to shoot two short films and four 30 second commercial spots that aired on the game's launch program on G4 network. The short films star R. Lee Ermey and comedian Brian Posehn. Downloadable content=Gun Sonata On February 22, 2011, Electronic Arts announced Gun Sonata, the first downloadable content (DLC) for Bulletstorm. The DLC was released on April 14, 2011 on PlayStation Store and Xbox Live Marketplace, and on May 19, 2011 on Games for Windows Marketplace. The content includes three \\"Anarchy\\" maps, two \\"Echo\\" missions and two \\"Leash\\" colors and adds five achievements/trophies (on Games for Windows ‚Äì Live/Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, respectively). Blood Symphony Blood Symphony was released on June 10, 2011 on Games for Windows Marketplace and Xbox Live Marketplace, and in July 2011 on the PlayStation Store. The content includes two \\"Echoes\\" maps, three \\"Anarchy\\" maps, a new mode called \\"The Ultimate Echoes\\" and five additional achievements/trophies. Reception=Critical Bulletstorm received positive reviews from critics. The game scored 9.1/10 from Computer and Video Games, 8/10 from IGN, 9/10 from Eurogamer, 9.25/10 from Game Informer, and 8/10 from Jeuxvideo.fr. Game Informers Tim Turi gave Bulletstorm a 9.25/10, praising the game's degree of character control, which he compared to Mirror's Edge. He also praised the game's darkly humorous storyline, calling it a \\"goofy sci-fi romp that doesn't deserve to have its cut-scenes skipped\\", and also liked Bulletstorms complex Skillshot-based combat and weapons system, praising them as very creative. However, he criticized the game's lack of multiplayer maps and the final hours of the campaign, calling it \\"stale\\". Eurogamer synthesis of the game was that it was \\"an astonishingly clever game folded up inside an exquisitely stupid one\\". However, several reviewers criticized the game design. For example, 1UP.com and The Escapist judged that the plot was overly serious considering the focus put by the designers on the gameplay, \\"dragging the game down.\\" Others considered that the multiplayer part of the game was limited and \\"gets tiresome\\". NoFrag found the plot fairly conventional and the dialogues not really funny, and the end of the solo campaign \\"sugary\\" contrary to the developers which said that the game was not taking itself too seriously. The game was also using too many quick time and scripted events for their liking, often breaking the flow of the gameplay. Sales Bulletstorm was the seventh selling title in February 2011 with over 285.6K copies sold. The game sold one million copies. As of July 25, 2011, Epic Games declared that they had failed to turn a profit on the game. However, Sebastian Wojciechowski, the CEO of People Can Fly following their split from Epic, considered that the game sold well, and it was never going to be considered as successful or profitable as Epic's Gears of War series at the time. While the final sales numbers were disappointing to both EA and Epic Games, the game has garnered a cult following in the years after its release. The HD rerelease of the game was considered far more successful in terms of sales. A sequel was planned but was later cancelled. Accolades The Full Clip Edition won the award for \\"Best Remaster\\" in Game Informers 2017 Shooter of the Year Awards. Fox News controversy On February 8, 2011, the game came under scrutiny by Fox News through an article on their website by John Brandon and later on February 20, 2011 through their televised broadcast and another article. Alongside the panel of Fox News was psychologist Carole Lieberman, who claimed \\"The increase in rapes can be attributed in large part to the playing out of [sexual] scenes in video games.\\" To support this claim, Lieberman referred to eight sources, one of them being Bulletstorm. Gaming blog Rock, Paper, Shotgun analysed Lieberman's claims, and found only one of eight sources she provided had anything to do with the subject at hand.

It was shot in Technicolor by RKO Radio Pictures. The film was completed in 1949, but was not released until 1952. The Three Musketeers' offsprings of Aramis, Porthos, D'Artagnan and Claire, the daughter of Athos, are reunited by the ageing Queen Anne to halt the villainy of her treacherous nephew, the Duc de Lavalle.http://www.allmovie.com/work/at- swords-point-3194 Plot The sons (and a daughter) of the original Four Musketeers ride to the rescue of besieged Queen Anne in 1648 France. D'Artagnan and his companions are alerted that the terminally ill Queen (Gladys Cooper) is being pressured by the evil Duc de Lavalle (Robert Douglas) into agreeing to a marriage with Princess Henriette (Nancy Gates). Too old (or dead) to respond, their sons (and one daughter) race to Court to help.

Eagle Lion also announced they would make a film called Sons of the Musketeers which concerned MGM who were making a version of The Three Musketeers. Eventually the project went to RKO where it was set up as a vehicle for Cornel Wilde. Lewis Allen was announced as director on 15 November 1949. Filming started 14 December 1949. MGM had some difficulties depicting Cardinal Richelieu in The Three Musketeers so the filmmakers decided to not show Cardinal Mazarin, even though he was in the original script. Notes * Porthos in At Sword's Point is played by Moroni Olsen, who played that character in his younger days in the 1935 film of the original 1844 Alexander Dumas novel, The Three Musketeers while Alan Hale Jr. plays the son of Porthos. His father, Alan Hale, Sr., appeared in The Man in the Iron Mask (1939) as an aging Porthos. * In another Three Musketeers movie, The Fifth Musketeer (1979), which retells the story of The Man in the Iron Mask, two of the young Musketeers from At Sword's Point reappear in the roles of their own fathers: Cornel Wilde stars as D'Artagnan and Alan Hale Jr. as Porthos.

Every team which participated in tournament has home, away and goalkeeper World Cup official kits featuring manufacturer logos and national emblems and the rest has those used in qualifications. In the European version, the squads are in accordance with official 1998 FIFA World Cup squads as well. Teams that did not qualify have line-ups from the qualifiers (in the North American version, all teams have lineups from the qualifiers). However the players' names are misspelled due to the lack of a FIFPro license, though they have their actual numbers, appearance, age, height, weight and abilities. In the European version, the game has more sponsors other than Reebok, such as Apple and Continental AG, which appear in adboards. The Japanese version was an officially licensed World Cup product and included accurate player names, though stylised with Japanese text. Game modes International Superstar Soccer 98 featured 6 different game modes: *Open Game: a friendly match against the computer or another player with choices of stadium, weather and time of day, as well as match handicaps (player condition, goalkeeper strength and number of players on the field, from 7 to 11).

Despite the deep penetration of Icelandic institutions by people personally connected with the deregulation of Iceland's banks and the associated banking boom, 'fortunately, and perhaps amazingly [...], there was little evidence in the final report [...] of a whitewash.

He was one of the senior Byzantine military leaders during the opening stages of the Byzantine‚ÄìSassanid War of 602‚Äì628. His defeats opened the way for the fall of Mesopotamia and Armenia and the invasion of Anatolia by the Persians. In 610, Phocas was overthrown by Heraclius, and Domentziolus was captured but escaped serious harm. Biography=Background The exact parentage of Domentziolus is unclear: Phocas had two known brothers, Comentiolus and another also named Domentziolus,. who has sometimes been suggested as the younger Domentziolus's father.cf. . Shortly after the accession of Phocas, in 603, the younger Domentziolus was raised to the titles of vir gloriosissimus, patricius and curopalates.. General in the East solidus of Emperor Phocas (r. 602‚Äì610). Domentziolus, however, is better known as a general in the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602‚Äì628. Phocas's elevation to the throne had been recognized by neither the Sassanid Persian shah Khosrau II, nor by Narses, the Byzantine governor of the province of Mesopotamia. The two had allied against Phocas, with Narses gathering his forces in Edessa, while waiting for Sassanid reinforcements.; . In 604, Phocas appointed Domentziolus as magister militum per Orientem and sent him against the Persians. His predecessors Germanus and Leontius had both been defeated, the former killed in battle and the latter recalled and imprisoned by Phocas.... According to the Life of St. Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus fell into a Persian ambush but was able to escape. In 604/605, he also surrounded Narses and his troops, and persuaded him to surrender on guarantees of his personal safety. Phocas, nonetheless, had Narses executed by burning him alive. At about the same time, Dara, an important Byzantine city in Mesopotamia, fell to the Persians. Khosrau was encouraged to cease simply raiding the Byzantine provinces, instead attempting to conquer them. In 607, he launched concurrent invasions on Mesopotamia and Armenia.. With the Byzantine forces at the Persian front having already suffered heavy casualties in previous confrontations, Domentziolus was unable to oppose the Sassanid raids during 605. There was also little chance of further reinforcements. Phocas had concluded peace treaties with the Lombards and Avars in an attempt to secure control of his provinces in the Italian Peninsula and the Balkans. He had already stripped the Balkans of most of their military forces, reassigning them to the Persian front. But this policy had backfired with the undermanned Balkans facing a Slavic invasion, notably endangering Thessalonica. While one Persian force, under Shahrbaraz, was able to secure control of Amida, Domentziolus concentrated his efforts on a second one under Shahin Vahmanzadegan. He was heavily defeated in the vicinity of Theodosiopolis (modern Erzurum), and the Persians were able to recover most of Persarmenia, which had been ceded to Byzantium in 591. In 608, Shahrbaraz and Shahin continued their respective efforts to conquer Mesopotamia and Armenia. By 609, the Sassanid conquest of Mesopotamia and Armenia was mostly complete. Shahin next led an invasion of Cappadocia. Domentziolus's forces were bypassed, while another kinsman of Phocas, called Sergius, attempted to face the invaders and was killed in combat. Sergius was possibly magister militum per Armeniam. Shahin managed to capture Caesarea Mazaca (modern Kayseri), the main city of the area. His forces were then able to make raids \\"all the way to Chalcedon\\" in Bithynia, in the vicinity of Constantinople.. Downfall of the regime Meanwhile, another front had opened. The Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder had revolted against Phocas. The situation in 609‚Äì610 was quickly becoming dire for Domentziolus and all Phocas loyalists. Their defense against the Sassanids had failed. There were Persian forces in Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria and the Anatolian provinces. Rebel Byzantine forces held Africa and Egypt. Slavs were occupying northern Illyricum. In Thessalonica and various towns of Anatolia and Syria, the Blues and Greens were settling their differences with open conflict. In areas of Syria, the Jews were revolting and lynching Christians. Even in Constantinople, the crowds taunted Phocas for his love of liquor, implying alcoholism.. In 610, Shahrbaraz was approaching Antioch. But the Persian front was not the immediate threat: the rebels of Africa were. Having secured control of Egypt, they proceeded to invade Syria and Cyprus while a large fleet under Heraclius the Younger, a son of the exarch, set sail for Constantinople. Supporters from Sicily, Crete and Thessalonica were joining his campaign. The rebels reached Constantinople in October 610. The only forces available to Phocas to defend the city were the Excubitors of his bodyguard and the irregular forces of the Blues and Greens, the city's racing factions. Priscus, the commander of the Excubitors, chose the moment to reveal his allegiance to Heraclius, having apparently secretly conspired for some time. The Greens also changed sides. Constantinople fell with relative ease.. Heraclius the Younger became the new Byzantine emperor. Phocas was executed, along with several of his kinsmen and loyalists. Domentziolus too was sentenced to death, but was pardoned and released after the intercession of Theodore of Syceon.. Nothing further is known of him after that. Family According to the hagiography of Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus was married to a lady named Irene, and had three sons. Elizabeth Dawes summarizes the tale given as following: \\"Domnitziolus, patrician and curopalates, asks Theodore to visit him in Arcadianae. His wife Eirene has no children: the saint blesses her and promises her three children - and they will be boys. All the male and female slaves of the household are brought to Theodore for his blessing. A slave girl had long been ill, troubled by a hidden demon. He beats on her breast and the demon declares itself. Then the Saint laying her on the ground Put his foot on her neck, turned his eyes to the east and uttered a silent prayer. At the end of his prayer he recited aloud the doxology of the Holy Trinity. For some time the slave girl remained speechless and then was completely cured. Later Eirene gave birth to three sons, as the Saint had prophesied. The conception of her first son immediately followed the Saint's prayer. Emperor and Patriarch say farewell to Theodore and he returns to his monastery.\\" Since Theodore died by 613, the tale would have to occur prior to this date..

The story was first published in 1893, The Niagara Book (Buffalo: Underhill and Nichols), pp. 93‚Äì109. Adam (based on Twain himself) describes how Eve (modeled after his wife Livy) gets introduced into the Garden of Eden, and how he has to deal with \\"this new creature with the long hair.\\"Page 3, facsimile of the original 1st edition The piece gives a humorous account of Genesis. It begins with the introduction of Eve, described as an annoying creature with a penchant for naming things, which Adam could do without. It moves on to detail Eve eating the apple and finding Cain, a perplexing creature which Adam can not figure out. He devotes his ironically scientific mind to demystifying Cain's species, thinking it a fish, then a kangaroo, then a bear. Eventually he figures out it is a human, like himself. The work is humorous and ironic, and gives a new spin on Genesis: few people have considered what life must have been like for Adam, who is discovering everything anew; the work does not consider God's role at all; and eventually, despite his initial deep annoyance with Eve, Adam finds himself in love with her.

Born either in Waipatu or Pakowhai near Hastings, he was the son of Henare Tomoana, the principal chief of the Heretaunga region and Member of Parliament for the Eastern MƒÅori electorate. He was educated at Te Aute College and was a member of the Young MƒÅori Party, an association of alumni from the college that dominated the MƒÅori political landscape in the early 20th century. Tomoana was in favour of MƒÅori enlistment in the First World War, and was a major fundraiser and organiser of recruitment drives for the New Zealand (MƒÅori) Pioneer Battalion. Between 1921 and 1932 he was an editor of the MƒÅori newspaper Te Toa Takitini, an Anglican periodical providing MƒÅori commentary on current events and MƒÅori history. Tomoana's musical compositions include E Pari RƒÅ and I Runga O Nga Puke. He was an Anglican lay reader, and at the time of his death was widely acknowledged as an authority on MƒÅori history and culture. Tomoana suffered a stroke and died on 15 April 1946. He was succeeded as the principal NgƒÅti Kahungunu chief of the Heretaunga region by his eldest son, Taanga Tomoana. Personal life Portrait of Tomoana c. 1905 In his youth, Tomoana received both a MƒÅori and a European education. He attended Te Aute College and, at his father's insistence, received military training in Porangahau from an uncle, Ihaia Hutana. During his time at Te Aute, Tomoana became a close friend and confidante of ƒÄpirana Ngata; they remained close all their lives. Despite having a club foot, Tomoana became a skilled sportsman, and represented Hawke's Bay and Gisborne in tennis, rugby, cricket, and golf. As a coach, he went on several international tours with sports teams from Te Aute College. Tomoana's first wife was Pani Potangaroa, whom he divorced in 1912 as they had failed to produce any children. The following year he began a courtship with Kuini Ripeka Raerena, who later became his second wife. The courtship was the subject of Tomoana's lyrical composition Pokarekare Ana. They had eight children and one adopted son. Lyrical compositions=Pokarekare Ana On 27 March 1913, Paraire Tomoana married Kuini Ripeka Raerena. According to the history recounted by their descendants, Tomoana wrote the lyrics to Pokarekare Ana as a letter to Kuini, and adopted the tune from an unknown origin. At Te Poho-o-Rawiri Marae, near Gisborne, he sang the song to Kuini and proposed marriage. The lyrics were first published in 1921, with the tune scored in waltz time. Most contemporary arrangements of the song use a 4/4 time signature, but performances by Tomoana's descendants still use the original arrangement. The origin of the tune is subject to debate; in the song's first publication in 1921, Tomoana wrote that \\"it emanated from the North of Auckland\\", and was later popularised by MƒÅori soldiers who were training near Auckland before embarking for the war in Europe. The question of the tune's origin has never been settled. Some descendants of ƒÄpirana Ngata have claimed that he was the true composer of the song's lyrics, but this was not supported by any claim made by Ngata himself. First World War As part of his involvement in the Young MƒÅori Party, Tomoana was committed to fundraising and recruiting MƒÅori for the First and Second World Wars. He became a prolific composer of MƒÅori action songs, many of which remain popular today. In 1915 he composed I Runga O NgƒÅ Puke, which was first performed in Wellington as the Second Maori Contingent departed New Zealand for the Gallipoli Campaign. In 1917 he collaborated with ƒÄpirana Ngata to compose Te Ope Tuatahi, the recruitment song for the New Zealand (MƒÅori) Pioneer Battalion. E Pari RƒÅ In 1918 Tomoana wrote the lyrics for E Pari RƒÅ, a lament to a MƒÅori soldier killed in the war. The origin of the tune that he adopted for E Pari RƒÅ has been attributed to a German waltz called the Blue Eye's Waltz. Two stories are attributed to the origin of the lyrics; according to some sources they were composed by Tomoana for Maku-i-te-Rangi Ellison, whose son Whakatomo Ellison had been killed in the war. According to Tomoana's eldest son Taanga Tomoana, the song was written at the request of Ngahiwi Petiha, a cousin of Tomoana's wife, who was convalescing from wounds in a hospital in England. The song became popular after the war, and was adopted by the Royal New Zealand Navy as its official slow march. It is still played by military bands of the New Zealand Defence Force, in particular by the band of the 7th Wellington and Hawke's Bay Battalion of the New Zealand Army. Composed as an action song, Tomoana originally wrote the score in a 6/8 time signature, however in contemporary performances it is often performed as a slow lullaby in 3/4. Contemporary MƒÅori performances often include a slow verse in 3/4 followed by a verse in double time, in which actions and poi may be used.

Three teenagers (two of whom had been known to Heather) were arrested two weeks after the discovery of her body; each of the three would later be tried and subsequently convicted of Heather's murder. One of the perpetrators would be sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole; a second individual would be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment plus 99 years for conspiracy to commit murder, while the third individual was sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole after 40 years. Conflicting testimony delivered at two of the perpetrators' separate trials leads to ongoing speculation as to which of the trio actually shot and killed Heather. Early life Heather Rose Rich (January 19, 1980October 3, 1996) was the third of four children and only daughter born to Gail and Duane Rich. Heather was an avid horse rider and a talented musician, and has been described by her family as \\"a naive girl with a big heart.\\" An academically successful sophomore who was popular with her peers at Waurika High School, she had a notably excitable personality. According to one of her friends, despite her fa√ßade of ebullience, Heather was a \\"very troubled\\" teenager, and she began to exhibit troublesome behavior both at home and at school in the late summer and early fall of 1996. Her classmate and former boyfriend, 17-year-old Randy Wood, would state this emotional behavior largely stemmed from Heather's restlessness at the fact Waurika held few amenities to entertain the town's youth. On September 27, she and another girl had been temporarily suspended from Waurika High School and the Waurika Eagles cheerleading team for their being noticeably drunk upon the sidelines of a school cheerleading performance. The duration of this suspension was just three days, and she was expecting to be a potential candidate to be the sophomore class homecoming queen of Waurika High School on October 11. October 2, 1996 At approximately 11 p.m. on the evening of October 2, 1996, Heather left her home without her parents' knowledge to meet a 17-year- old Waurika High School senior named Joshua Bagwell in a trailer parked at the rear of the home of Bagwell's grandfather. Bagwell had already been drinking heavily with his friends, 19-year-old Curtis Gambill and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Wood. One of the trio had earlier telephoned Heather to suggest she join them at Bagwell's trailer that evening.Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime p. 183 Shortly after Heather arrived at the trailer, both Wood and Gambill left Heather and Bagwell alone for approximately one hour, believing that as this was their first date, the two wished to be left alone. When Wood and Gambill returned to the trailer approximately one hour later, both Bagwell and Heather were naked, and a bottle of gin had been half consumed. Heather was extremely drunk, later being described as largely insensible; Bagwell would later claim the two had engaged in consensual sex. According to Wood's later trial testimony, the three youths, themselves intoxicated, began goading each other to sexually assault Heather while she was naked and largely insensible. Wood then proceeded to sexually assault Heather (digitally penetrating her) before Gambill himself engaged in unconsensual sex with the semi-conscious girl. Shortly after Gambill had engaged in sex with Heather, she partially roused out of her semi-conscious state and began moaning, screaming and crying. Murder Reportedly fearing the girl would later accuse the trio of rape, Gambill then decided to kill Heather and, with a measure of force, successfully persuaded Bagwell and Wood to assist him in the commission of this act. According to Wood, Gambill pointed his shotgun at him and ordered him to dress Heather before he and Bagwell carried her into Bagwell's grandfather's pickup truck. Bagwell then began to drive in a seemingly aimless manner around southern Oklahoma for in excess of an hour as Gambill repeatedly exclaimed they would have to kill her before driving to desolate property his grandparents owned as a potential murder location. Gambill vetoed Bagwell's choice of a murder location, stating this location could easily be traced to the trio. Gambill then chose to drive the truck; driving towards a cement bridge upon a rural road in Belknap Creek, Texas. At this location, Gambill retrieved his shotgun from the vehicle as he ordered Bagwell and Wood to \\"get her out and put her on the side (of the road).\\" Bagwell and Wood then carried Heather towards the bridge, where Gambill proceeded to shoot her several times in the head and torso with the shotgun as she lay upon the ground. Wood would later claim that he had sat inside the pickup truck as Gambill approached Heather with the shotgun in his hand; he had then covered his face with his hands before hearing \\"the first shot ... then I heard a bunch more.\\" He then climbed from the truck to observe Gambill appearing \\"dazed at what he'd done.\\" Joshua Bagwell then took one of Heather's shoelaces and used this item to secure a rock to weight her body. Heather's body was then thrown over the guard rail into the creek below before the trio attempted to conceal the extensive bloodstains at the precise murder scene by kicking and throwing soil across the ground. Discovering that their daughter's bed had not been slept in and that all her possessions were untouched, yet that her bedroom window was open, Gail and Duane Rich reported Heather missing to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department the following day.Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime p. 179 Despite the fact Heather had not taken any of her personal possessions with her, when police learned from Gail that Heather had recently argued with her mother over a $300 phone bill for which she (Heather) had largely been responsible for the accrual, investigators initially assumed Heather had likely temporarily ran away from her household to stay with friends, and would likely return home within hours. Aghast, Gail responded: \\"When your daughter is missing, you can stay at home!\\" She and her family then began making their own inquiries around Waurika for information as to Heather's whereabouts. They would subsequently hire a private investigator to assist in the search for their daughter.Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime p. 180 Autopsy Heather's body was discovered partially submerged in the Red River by a rancher and his daughter on October 10. Due to a combination of decomposition and the sheer number of shotgun wounds she had received, including the fact she had been shot once in the back of the head, her face and body were largely unrecognizable. Thus initially, her body was tentatively identified by her father via his recognizing a gold signet ring Heather had received as a present for her 16th birthday. Her body would later be officially identified via dental records.Time to Kill. pressreader.com July 5, 2018 The autopsy of Heather's body revealed she had been shot nine times with an M-9 Winchester shotgun, with pellets from the buckshot rounds fired also hitting her body in several locations. One of these shots had been fired into the back of her head, with the remaining eight rounds being fired into her lower back, waist, pelvis and buttocks. In conjunction with the pattern of the bloodstains discovered at the preliminary crime scene, the trajectory of the shotgun wounds indicated Heather had most likely been shot as she lay face down, with her death being almost instantaneous. Funeral The funeral of Heather Rich was conducted on Monday, October 14, 1996 at the Praise Assembly of God Church in Comanche County. She was laid to rest in Fletcher Cemetery. As her murderer or murderers had neither been apprehended or convicted at the time of the service and with her family strongly suspecting her murderer(s) had not been strangers to her, Heather's family forbade any individual outside her immediate family from touching her coffin throughout the service, with her mother stating that prior to the service, she had promised her only daughter that \\"whoever did this to her would never touch her again.\\" Perpetrators=Curtis Allen Gambill Curtis Gambill was a high-school dropout. He was born on February 24, 1977, and at the time of Heather's murder, he was living with his 64-year- old grandmother in Terral, Oklahoma. Gambill was known to possess a short temper, and to exhibit sadistic features, being known to have regularly forced boys to fight each other in his presence upon the threat that if they did not do so, they would otherwise have to fight him.Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime p. 184 He had previously escaped from every youth detention center in which he had been incarcerated, and had been briefly committed to a psychiatric hospital at age 17. In addition, he had been convicted of feloniously carrying a firearm in February 1996; receiving a five-year suspended sentence. In the week prior to Heather's disappearance, Gambill was notably depressed due to his best friend, 20-year-old Dennis Goss, having committed suicide on 25 September. Just days prior to October 2, he and his close friend Joshua Bagwell had attended Goss's funeral. Joshua Luke Bagwell Joshua Bagwell was born on December 21, 1978. His parents were among the wealthiest landowners in southern Oklahoma, although as his parents' employment led them to be largely absent from home, he had lived with his grandparents since the age of 16. Bagwell was a senior at Waurika High School, and by October 1996, had been the recipient of six new cars. He was variously described as being a snobbish and pampered youth, although he was considered somewhat of an outcast among his peers.Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime pp. 183-184 He and Gambill had formed a mutual friendship, in part due to their shared interests in firearms, drinking, camping, and fishing. Occasionally, the pair traveled to the environs of Belknap Creek for camping and fishing trips.Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime pp. 184-185 Undisciplined at home, Bagwell had once been arrested for driving while intoxicated, and had demanded a lawyer while resisting arrest. Both Randy Wood and Heather Rich had been impressed by Bagwell's affluent means; the latter commenting on more than one occasion that she had flirted with Bagwell until she had secured a seat in his white Dodge Stealth for the forthcoming Waurika homecoming parade. On the night of October 2, Heather had sneaked from her parents' home to meet Bagwell for what was supposed to be their first date. Randy Lee Wood Randy Wood was born on July 7, 1979. He and his single- parent mother had frequently relocated throughout Oklahoma during his childhood‚Äîfrequently resulting in him having to attend numerous different schools. By 1996, Wood lived with his mother in a largely dilapidated house, and his family was known as one of the poorest in Waurika. Wood began smoking cannabis in the third grade, often stealing the money or the narcotic itself from his mother. Despite his personal disadvantages, Wood endeavored to better himself among his peers, and by 1996, was the captain of the Waurika High School football team, having earned the respect of the entire team. He and Heather had dated for approximately five months, during which they had regularly attended church together and conversed on the phone, although their relationship, despite being an intimate one, had never resulted in sexual intercourse, and the two were frequently mistaken as simply being friends. Having heard a rumor Heather had skinny-dipped at a party, Wood chose to end their relationship, although the two remained close friends. One week after Heather's body was found at Belknap Creek, Randy Wood was crowned homecoming king of Waurika High School. Investigation and arrests A total of 14 investigators were assigned to investigate Heather's murder. The investigation was assisted by the FBI in the event federal kidnapping charges could be brought against the perpetrator or perpetrators should Heather have been transported across state lines against her will. Initially encountering a wall of silence from much of Waurika's youth as to Heather's potential whereabouts, by the second week of the inquiry, investigators focused more closely on a potential lead provided by Heather's best friend on the cheerleading squad that Heather may have left her home to attend a party at the home of a classmate of theirs named Joshua Luke Bagwell. Upon informal questioning, Bagwell initially claimed he and a friend of his named Randy Wood (both of whom had earlier been questioned by Gail Rich as to her daughter's whereabouts) had not seen Heather on October 2 as they had been playing dominoes and drinking whisky and beer in his trailer until approximately 6:00 a.m. the following day. Wood would corroborate this statement. Having discovered that the buckshot rounds fired from the Winchester shotgun which killed Heather were of a distinct brand, investigators soon learned that only one store in Waurika had stocked this brand. Conversing with the owners of the store, these investigators discovered that just days prior to the murder, 20 rounds had been purchased by one Joshua Bagwell. The owner of this store was also able to positively identify Bagwell from an assembled police lineup. Furthermore, an employee of this store was adamant that at the time Bagwell had made this purchase, he had been in the company of another young male. Further discovering that Bagwell had spent much of his time in recent months in the company of a 19-year-old high school dropout named Curtis Allen Gambill, and had regularly hunted in his company, Curtis Gambill was arrested on October 24. He was questioned for a total of eight hours, and agreed to submit to a polygraph test pertaining to his potential culpability in Heather's murder. Gambill failed this polygraph test, and subsequently agreed to allow investigators to subject the shotgun he owned to ballistic fingerprinting to determine whether this firearm had been used to murder Heather Rich. Discovering the results of the ballistic analysis of his shotgun indicated the firearm had been the one used to murder Heather Rich, and that the weapon was capable of firing nine rounds before requiring reloading, Gambill confessed to being a participant in Heather's murder, also naming Bagwell and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Lee Wood, as participants in the murder. According to Gambill, Wood had been the instigator of the crime, and the actual murderer, with himself and Bagwell acting upon his (Wood's) instructions. Wood's actual motive, Gambill claimed, had been sexual jealousy due to the fact Heather had engaged in sex with Bagwell and not himself. Bagwell and Wood were also arrested on October 24. Bagwell refused to admit any culpability in Heather's murder; invoking his right to silence and refusing to submit to a polygraph test. Shortly thereafter, his family hired a team of high-profile lawyers to defend him.Texas Monthly On... Texas True Crime p. 187 By contrast, Randy Wood willingly agreed to provide a written statement in which he confessed to his being a participant in the murder, although he was adamant Curtis Gambill had been the instigator of the entire crime, and the individual who had shot and killed Heather, adding that Joshua Bagwell had been a knowing and willing participant. Wood further claimed not to have actually believed Gambill was serious in his vocal intentions to murder Heather until Gambill had parked the pickup upon the Belknap Creek bridge. He also agreed to submit to a polygraph test to verify his version of events‚Äîthe results of which fully corroborated his written statement. Initially, all three individuals were charged with the kidnapping of Heather and denied bail in Oklahoma. All would subsequently be formally charged with first-degree murder in Montague County, Texas on October 25. The trials of all three defendants were held in Texas. Owing to the law of Texas, all three individuals were tried as adults. Trials=Gambill Curtis Gambill was brought to trial on October 15, 1997. He was tried in Fort Worth. Shortly after his trial had begun, Gambill accepted a plea bargain offered by Montague County district attorney Tim Cole, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to Heather's murder‚Äîadmitting to being the individual who had physically taken her life‚Äîin exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty. He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment with a potential possibility of parole after 30 years. As part of his plea bargain, Gambill also agreed to testify against Bagwell at his upcoming trial. Montague County courthouse. Both Bagwell and Wood were tried at this location in 1998. Bagwell Joshua Bagwell was brought to trial in February 1998. Prior to and at his trial, he refused to admit any culpability in her murder; claiming that his intercourse with Heather after Gambill and Wood had initially left the two alone in his trailer had been consensual; that he had later left his trailer prior to Gambill and Wood actually discussing killing Heather; and that he had ultimately believed the trio were simply driving Heather around in an effort to sober her up before returning her home. Furthermore, he stated that he was unaware of any actual plan to murder her. At Bagwell's trial, Gambill reneged upon his own previous agreement with prosecutors; changing his story and reverting to his initial claims upon arrest. This testimony largely suited the portrayal of Bagwell by the defense; minimizing Bagwell's role in the murder and corroborating his own claims that Wood had committed Heather's murder. Randy Wood had initially accepted a similar plea bargain to that previously offered to Gambill in exchange for his testimony at Bagwell's then- forthcoming trial. However, the evening before he was due to give evidence, Wood‚Äîagainst the vehement advice of his defense attorney‚Äîchanged his mind and rejected the plea bargain, insisting he wished to testify against Bagwell without any preconditions despite being informed by his lawyer that he risked either a longer prison sentence or a potential death penalty if convicted. On the third day of testimony, Wood testified under oath that Gambill had largely orchestrated the murder, had shot and killed Heather, and that Bagwell had been a full, knowing participant in the act. The day after Wood delivered his testimony, Bagwell testified before the jury. He insisted he had not been present in his trailer when Wood and Gambill had discussed murdering Heather, and blamed Wood for her actual shooting. Bagwell added his conjecture that Wood's motivation for this act had been that he had been angry at Heather for earlier refusing to engage in intercourse with him (Wood). Bagwell finally claimed not to have been physically close to the actual crime scene at the time Heather had actually been murdered, but had walked away to urinate. He solely admitted to a limited role in refusing to disclose acknowledgement of the murder after the event. Despite this testimony, when questioned as to his witnessing the actual shooting of Heather Rich, Bagwell contradicted himself in his reply, claiming he had witnessed \\"Curtis‚Äîsorry I mean Randy‚Äîlowering the gun.\\" Joshua Bagwell was convicted of capital murder on February 14, 1998 and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. He was sentenced to a mandatory life term. He would later be sentenced to an additional sentence of 99 years for conspiracy to commit capital murder on February 17. Wood Randy Wood was tried for capital murder later in 1998. Against the advice of his attorney, Pat Morris, Wood declined another plea bargain offered prior to his trial; choosing to plead not guilty to Heather's murder, stating that although he was aware of the law of Texas, he had neither intended for Heather to be killed, and that he had not physically taken her life himself. Wood was found guilty of capital murder on August 25, 1998. As the State did not seek the death penalty in his trial, he was automatically sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood will first become eligible for parole in 2036. Aftermath * Randy Wood requested to meet with Heather's parents prior to his own trial, to explain his actions on the night of their daughter's murder, the moral and legal reasoning behind his course of action regarding his testimony at the trial of Joshua Bagwell, and the legal vulnerability this had subjected himself to. Heather's parents agreed to this endeavor. In an televised interview, Wood stressed his regret regarding his actions in the early morning hours of October 3, 1996. Having asked for their forgiveness but stating upfront he did not expect to receive it, Gail Rich responded by stating she and her husband had forgiven him for the hurt he had caused them, but they could not forgive him for his role in their daughter's murder, adding, \\"Only Heather can do that.\\" * In 1999, Wood filed an appeal against his conviction with the Second Court of Appeals of Texas. In this appeal, he did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented at his trial, but contended that his attorney had been ineffective in his service; failing to request an initial instruction upon the potential lesser-included offense of murder, an erroneous introduction of the guilty or innocence plea phase of his trial, and his attorney's failing to raise objection at this stage. This appeal was overruled on October 14, 1999. * Joshua Bagwell also appealed his sentencing; his appeal was filed with the Second Court of Appeals of Texas in November 2000, arguing that because Heather had been unconscious when taken to the Belknap Creek bridge, she could not move, and if unable to move, she therefore had no movements to restrain, and restraint of the victim is an integral component of kidnapping. As such, Bagwell contended, because the Texas Penal Code defines capital murder as \\"a level of murder that requires a kidnapping component\\", he could not be guilty of the level of murder for which he was convicted. This appeal was rejected on January 31, 2001. * In January 2002, Curtis Gambill and Joshua Bagwell were transferred from state prison to the Montague County jail in order that Gambill could be additionally tried for conspiracy to commit murder. On January 16, he (Gambill) was additionally convicted and sentenced to a second, cumulative, term of life imprisonment. He had earlier waived his legal right to a trial by jury. * Curtis Gambill, Joshua Bagwell and two other inmates briefly escaped from the Montague County Jail in which all four were held in January 2002. All four escapees were arrested nine days later in Ardmore, Oklahoma. The four individuals had held a member of public hostage at an Oklahoma gas station, but surrendered to authorities after several hours. * In 2009, a cousin of Randy Wood named Denise Horner initiated a campaign for a commutation of Wood's potential life sentencing. This campaign was endorsed and supported by the prosecutor at Wood's trial, Tim Cole, who was reportedly regretful that he had not tried Wood for the lesser charge of conspiracy to commit murder. Nonetheless, when Cole approached Montague County district attorney in 2010, he was reluctant to consider the proposal. He would later confirm his decision to Denise Horner in 2011, stating that following his consultations with the Sheriff and District Judge, it had been \\"my understanding from them that they are also unwilling to recommend a reduction of sentence.\\" * In 2016, Randy Wood married a woman from New Zealand. The two had initially corresponded as friends, although they gradually formed a relationship after she traveled to Texas to meet him face- to-face. This woman‚Äîwho wishes to remain anonymous‚Äîmoved to Texas in 2018 in order to be closer to Wood. One of the motivations for her decision to relocate to Texas is her commitment to campaign for those under the age of 18 not to be tried as adults within the state. Although Wood's wife has stated that she hopes he will be released long before his initial parole eligibility date, she has stated she is committed to remain with him. * All three perpetrators of Heather's murder remain incarcerated and all serve their sentences in different Texas prisons. Curtis Gambill is currently incarcerated at the John M. Wynne Unit in northern Huntsville; Joshua Bagwell is incarcerated at the Barry Telford Unit in New Boston; and Randy Wood is incarcerated at the James V.

Biography Yehuda Bacon was born into a Hasidic (Orthodox Jewish) family. In the fall of 1942, at the age of 13, Bacon was deported with his family from Ostrava to the Ghetto Theresienstadt, where he shared a room with George Brady. In Theresienstadt he played in the children's opera Brundib√°r. In December 1943, he was deported to the concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, where he and other imprisoned children were used to bedazzle the International Committee of the Red Cross in the so-called \\"family camp\\". In fact, the \\"Birkenau Boys\\" were used for transport work in the entire complex of Auschwitz II-Birkenau. In June 1944, Bacon saw his father murdered in the gas chambers. At this time, his mother and his sister Hanna were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp, where they died a few weeks before its liberation. On January 18, 1945 Bacon was sent on the camp's death march, which lasted three days and led him through the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp to its subcamp Gunskirchen. In March, Bacon was sent on another death march to a subcamp of Mauthausen, Gunskirchen, in the woods. As he reports, there was no food, water or clothing. On May 5, 1945 Bacon was liberated by the US Army. Before the SS guards left the camp, they poisoned the rest of the food. Many inmates had died from the effects of high food supply, which their bodies could not absorb anymore. Bacon and his friend Wolfie Adler (who later became an Israeli rabbi and published a book about his experiences) left the camp. US soldiers brought them to a hospital in the Austrian town Steyr. After his recovery, Bacon returned to Prague hoping to reunite with his mother and sisters. He lived in an orphanage not far from Prague in ≈†ti≈ô√≠n, which was established by the Czech educator and humanist P≈ôemysl Pitter. The writer H.G. Adler was also a teacher there. Through Pitter and Adler, he found a way to live after the liberation. In 1946, Bacon immigrated to Palestine with the help of Youth Aliyah. There he studied at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design. In 1959, he became a professor of graphic art and drawing at Bezalel.\\"Concentration camp,\\" Yehuda Bacon Yehuda Bacon lives with his wife Leah Bacon in Jerusalem. He has two sons and a daughter by a former marriage to Josephine Bacon.  Art career  Reproduction of Bacon painting, Yad Vashem, Jerusalem After liberation, Bacon decided to become an artist to process his experiences and try to describe what he lived through.Yehuda Bacon, Holocaust Survivor and Artist As a survivor he feels a responsibility to tell his story and to make future generations aware of their responsibility in the present and future. He was among the first survivors of the Shoah to set foot again on German soil. Bacon's drawings show details and sequences of what he saw in the concentration camps and scenes he drew as a teenager shortly after the liberation. His drawings served as evidence in trials against Nazi criminals (including the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem and the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials) and were used in the litigation against Holocaust denier David Irving, who challenges the existence of gas chambers in Auschwitz. His art is a kind of asynergistic interaction: on the one hand, Bacon processes the experiences of his childhood and youth in the concentration camps, on the other he is searching for a way of understanding through his art. Bacon was early part of interfaith dialogues and Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in the 1950s. His art is shown in several museums and collections around the world, among the Israel Museum and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the United States Congress in Washington D.C., in the homes of Theodore Roosevelt, John D. Rockefeller, Martin Buber and Chaim Weizmann as well as in London.

It was under his leadership that the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue was first published. When he retired in 1974, he had been managing editor of the magazine for 704 issues, then a record among magazines published by Time, Inc., SI's parent company.  Early life and family  Andr√© Laguerre was born June 7, 1915, in England to Frenchman L√©on James Laguerre and his English wife, Dorothy. He was the oldest of three children; he had a younger brother, Leon and a younger sister, Odette. His father was in the French diplomatic corps, and the family moved frequently during his early years. Before the age of ten, Andre had lived in England, France and Syria. In the summer of 1927, his father took a post at the French Consulate General in San Francisco. The family lived in the upper-class neighborhood of Sea Cliff, and Andre attended a number of private schools, including the Santa Monica School and St. Ignatius College Preparatory. While in San Francisco, he became a fan of American sports, especially baseball, and also had his first job in journalism, as a copyboy for the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1929, he was sent back to England for school. He graduated in 1931, having earned an Oxford Certificate, but he declined to matriculate at Oxford University, instead preferring to pursue a career as a journalist. He enrolled in a correspondence course, and took a job at a book store to support himself.MacCambridge (1997), pp. 75-79  Early career and military service  He worked hard for many years as a freelance journalist, and began to be noticed for his writing. He wrote for both English language and French language publications. In 1938, he covered the Munich Agreement for the French daily Paris-Soir. When World War II broke out, he enlisted in the French Army as a corporal. His first assignment was on patrol on the Maginot Line. He later served as a liaison to the British forces at Arras, and remained with them until the Battle of Arras forced their retreat. He stayed with the British forces until the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, where he was one of the last to be evacuated. His evacuation ship was sunk by a mine, and he was rescued by a British destroyer, bleeding heavily from a neck wound. Laguerre credited his rescue to his ease with the English language (his rescuers took him for British). He criticised his rescuers in later years for refusing to help Frenchmen who were around him; many of them drowned.MacCambridge (1997) p. 80 After his rescue and recovery from his injuries, days after Charles de Gaulle's famous June 18th Speech, he was given the option of being discharged from his duties, or to join the Free French forces. He chose the latter. He was assigned as a sentry guarding Charles de Gaulle's headquarters. While at that post, he wrote a letter to de Gaulle suggesting techniques to improve the morale of Free French troops. De Gaulle took immediate notice, making him assistant to the chief press attach√®. Within a few months, de Gaulle moved Laguerre into the chief position himself, making him his primary press liaison. He followed de Gaulle on his travels to North Africa in 1943 to inspect Free French forces there, and to Washington, D.C., to visit with American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1944. He stayed on de Gaulle's staff for a while after the war, but after interviewing with Henry Luce, the head of Time, Inc., he left de Gaulle's service to accept a job writing for Time magazine.MacCambridge (1997), pp. 80-81  Time  Laguerre began his Time career in 1946 as one of the magazine's European correspondents. Working mainly out of the Time Paris bureau, he hobnobbed with Paris's top citizens; he was a frequent dinner guest of Albert Camus. He also maintained his connection to sports, first acquired in his youth in San Francisco, by moonlighting as a sports reporter for the Paris-based English-language International Herald Tribune, writing a horse racing column under the pseudonym \\"Eddie Snow\\".MacCambridge (1997), p. 81 Meanwhile, Laguerre was attracting the attention of Time, Inc.'s top brass. In 1948, he was promoted to Paris bureau chief and, in December 1950, he was brought to New York City by Time founder Henry Luce for a special one-year assignment to work out of the main Time offices. He returned to Europe in 1951 to serve as London bureau chief. In 1955, after the sudden death of the Paris bureau chief, he was given that position back, and for a time he held both posts simultaneously. While Time bureau chief of London and Paris, he also spent some time writing about his favorite subject, sports, for the magazine, for which he covered the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. In early 1956, he accepted a temporary assignment to head a contingent of writers to cover the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy for Time, Inc.'s fledgling Sports Illustrated, started two years earlier by Luce. His first article for the magazine was a piece on the dominance of the Soviet Union in their first Winter Olympics. Three months later, Luce installed him as assistant managing editor of Sports Illustrated.MacCambridge (1997), pp. 82-85 On June 7, 1955, Laguerre married Princess Nathalie Alexandria Kotchoubey de Beauharnais, a Russian princess and descendant of both Catherine the Great and Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. The couple had met in 1943 while Andr√© was working for General de Gaulle, and Nathalie was a reporter for Time. They had two daughters, Mich√®le Anne Laguerre and Claudine H√©l√®ne Laguerre.  Sports Illustrated  As assistant managing editor, his first major assignment was to head the team of reporters and photographers covering the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Among those traveling with Laguerre were Roger Bannister, the former British track and field star and first man in history to run a competition mile in under four minutes, and Roy Terrell, who would eventually succeed Laguerre as managing editor of Sports Illustrated.  Managing editor  Laguerre was promoted to managing editor of Sports Illustrated in May 1960, after four years as assistant managing editor. His time at the magazine was instrumental in saving what was, when he took over, a financially insolvent publication. He would serve as managing editor for fourteen years, leading the magazine for a total of 704 issues, then a record among Time, Inc. managing editors. During his tenure, the circulation grew from 900,000 to 2,250,000 issues, and the advertising budget grew from $11.9 million to $72.2 million. He altered the look and feel of the magazine, changing its focus from a lifestyle magazine that focused on leisure sports, to one that covered the major American team sports, at a time when television vastly altered the way in which such sports were covered. As such, he kept Sports Illustrated at the head of the growth of interest in these sports. He also placed a heavy emphasis on the use of color photography and late deadline, to keep the magazine up to date and visually appealing. He hired and encouraged writers who were masters at prose, emphasizing writing over sportswriting, and the crop of writers he brought to the magazine, including Frank Deford, Dan Jenkins, Budd Schulberg, and Gil Rogin, helped change the way people wrote about sports. Laguerre had been very guarded about his personal life among his coworkers. Deford, who worked closely with him for many years, and who looked up to him as a mentor, said of him, \\"Laguerre was a fascinating paradox: He was almost constitutionally withdrawn, but among the friends he chose, he was magnetic.\\" One publisher called him \\"A powerful personality\\" while another called him \\"A close-mouthed, self-contained man who seemed forbidding to some ... despite his reserve, [his] personality was pervading, dominating; he exuded strength and leadership.\\" Among his more curious and enduring innovations was the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. The winter months, between the college bowl season and the start of Major League Baseball's spring training, was a slow time for sports journalism. At the time, winter team sports like basketball and ice hockey were regional niche sports, and there was little to write about. Laguerre had instituted an annual February issue titled \\"Fun in the Sun\\", where he sent his staff to an exotic locale to write about and photograph it for his readers. In 1964, he asked Jule Campbell, then a fashion reporter for Sports Illustrated, to \\"go to some beautiful place and put a pretty girl on the cover\\" of that year's \\"Fun in the Sun\\" issue. That year's issue featured only five pages of girls in swimsuits, and still predominantly featured travel writing, including articles about snorkeling and fish-watching. With the help of that year's \\"Fun in the Sun\\" issue, 1964 became the first year that Sports Illustrated would turn a profit. Though originally only planned as a one-off event, Laguerre was convinced by Sports Illustrated art director Dick Gangel to bring back the swimsuits in 1965, only \\"a lot sexier\\". Laguerre once again assigned Jule Campbell to scout models and locations. The 1965 issue contained an article entitled \\"The Nudity Cult\\" and de-emphasized the travelogue-like writing of previous \\"Fun in the Sun\\" issues from which it evolved. Since then, the Swimsuit Issue has become the biggest selling issue of the magazine, and a major cross-over publication for the fashion and modeling worlds as well. Laguerre's tenure as managing editor had a profound effect on the other 51 issues of the year as well. During the magazine's first several years, prior to Laguerre's arrival, the magazine did not place major American team sports at the forefront. As an example, during 1955 and 1956, the magazine's first two years, it featured as many articles on fishing as on professional football, 23 articles. By 1965‚Äì1966, five years into Laguerre's term, the magazine published only eight articles on fishing, while it published over 60 articles on pro football.MacCambridge (1997), pp 124 Besides changing the types of sports being covered, the manner in which they were covered changed as well. Under earlier managing editors, the magazine's writing and editorial staff was organized by department. Thus, there was a fashion department, a travel department, and a sports department, which covered all sports. Laguerre reorganized the magazine, giving each sport its own separate department, so there would be a dedicated staff of writers in the baseball department, and a different boxing department, and another for pro football, and so on. Laguerre also encouraged serious investigative journalism, and did not shy away from controversial issues. In 1961, writer Ray Cave broke a story on point shaving in college basketball. In 1968, under Laguerre's direction, and under secrecy from his superiors, the magazine ran a five-part series on the experience of black athletes in America.MacCambridge (1997), pp 104, 115, 160 Laguerre's later years showed less success as the magazine became an industry leader. In 1968, its coverage of the Mexico City Olympics was heavily criticized, having been \\"scooped\\" on most stories by both Time and Life magazines. A 1969 book by Jack Olsen, titled The Girls in the Office, embarrassed Time Inc. over its treatment of its female employees, including those at Sports Illustrated. In 1970, 23 women on staff at Sports Illustrated signed a petition demanding equal treatment. Laguerre relented, promoting Pat Ryan to senior editor, and paying her the same as the men in her same position. By 1973, Laguerre's leadership was under a direct challenge from within his staff and from his superiors. A January 1973 story in New York Magazine was highly critical of the degrading quality of the writing and of the stagnating corporate culture at Sports Illustrated. By September of that year, Laguerre was asked to step down as managing editor. He was offered an executive position in corporate offices which he refused and his resignation was complete by February 1, 1974.MacCambridge (1997), pp 165‚Äì166, 172‚Äì176, 193  Later career and death  After retiring as managing editor, he remained with Sports Illustrated in order to head a group looking into publishing international editions of the magazine. He was offered the job as managing editor of Playboy, and, insulted by the low $45,000 salary Hugh Hefner offered him, he turned the job down. In 1975, he founded a bi-monthly horse-racing magazine, Classic, which he headed until shortly before his death of a heart attack in New York on January 18, 1979, at the age of sixty-three.

Formerly the chapel to Capernwray Hall, it is now an independent Evangelical chapel. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The chapel was built by Mr and Mrs George Marton between 1835 and 1840 as a private chapel for Capernwray Hall. George Marton was Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire and in addition to Capernwray Hall, owned Borwick Hall, Borwick railway station, and a number of farms. It was designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe and at that stage consisted of a simple rectangle. The chapel could seat 100 people, and the gallery formed the family pew. In 1856 E. G. Paley, Sharpe's successor, added the tower, chancel and west window. During the Second World War, the boarders from Ripley St Thomas School, Lancaster, were evacuated to Capernwray Hall and used the chapel for worship. After the war, in 1946, Major W. Ian Thomas and his wife bought the hall and the chapel for the use of Capernwray Missionary Fellowship of Torchbearers. By 1962 it had become too small for the numbers using it and it was converted into a dormitory by adding a false ceiling and dormer windows to make an upper floor. Having been disused for a time, the Evangelical Fellowship were given the use of the chapel by Mrs Thomas. Architecture Capernwray Chapel is constructed in sandstone rubble with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave, a two-bay chancel at a lower level and a southwest tower over the porch. The windows on the north and south walls are all lancets, at the east end is a three-light lancet window and at the west end is a five-light window. There is a doorway in the north chancel wall. The tower has five stages with clasping buttresses. In the lowest stage is a west doorway above which is a lancet window. The bell openings consist of louvred three-light lancets. At the top of the tower is a pyramidal roof with a weather vane. Gargoyles protrude from the gutters and on the gables are cross finials.

Ricketts House, and Ganoga) is a Georgian-style house made of sandstone, built in 1852 or 1855 on the shore of Ganoga Lake in Colley Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It was home to several generations of the Ricketts family, including R. Bruce Ricketts and William Reynolds Ricketts. Originally built as a hunting lodge, it was also a tavern and post office, and served as part of a hotel for much of the 19th century. After 1903 the house served as the Ricketts family's summer home; they kept it even as they sold over to the state of Pennsylvania from 1920 to 1950. The house was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in 1936 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1983. A group of investors bought the lake, surrounding land, and house in 1957 and developed them privately for housing and recreation. The house became the Ganoga Lake Association's clubhouse, and is not open to the public. The original mansion is an L-shaped structure, two-and-a-half stories high, with stone walls thick. It was built in a clearing surrounded by old-growth forest with a view to the lake to the east. In 1913 a -story wing was added to the north side of the house and the original structure was renovated. The house has seven rooms, four porches, and its original hardware and woodwork. Dormers and some windows were added in the renovation, and electrical wiring and modern plumbing have been added since. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion \\"is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture\\". Location The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion is on the southwest shore of Ganoga Lake in Colley Township in the southeastern part of Sullivan County. The mansion and lake are on a part of the Allegheny Plateau known as North Mountain; the plateau formed about 300 to 250 million years ago in the Alleghenian orogeny. Rocks‚Äîgray sandstone with conglomerates and some siltstone‚Äîof the Mississippian Pocono Formation more than 340 million years old, underlie the house and lake.Braun, Inners, pp. 1‚Äì13. The lake is in a shallow valley, deep, which is impounded by glacial till up to thick at the southeast end, where Kitchen Creek exits.Braun, p. 12. The earliest recorded inhabitants of the region were the Susquehannocks, who left or died out by 1675. The land then came under the control of the Iroquois, who sold it to the British in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.Wallace, pp. 99‚Äì108, 159. The land on which the house was later built was first part of Northumberland County, then became part of Lycoming County in 1795. The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between 1822 and 1827; it connected the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The lake was then known as Long Pond, and the Long Pond Tavern, just north of where the house was later built, was a lunch stop for the stagecoach on the turnpike.Ricketts, pp. 2‚Äì6.Petrillo, pp. 40‚Äì43. Sullivan County was formed from Lycoming County in 1847, and two years later Colley Township was formed from Cherry Township. History alt=Black and white aerial view of a narrow lake in wooded hills Lodge and tavern Brothers Clemuel Ricketts (1794‚Äì1858) and Elijah G. Ricketts (1803‚Äì1877) were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor while on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of Ganoga Lake in 1850, and wanted their own hunting preserve. They bought the lake, Long Pond Tavern, and of surrounding land in the early 1850s and soon began building a stone house between the turnpike and the lake shore to replace the log tavern. According to William Reynolds Ricketts' HABS history of the house, Petrillo's history of the region Ghost Towns of North Mountain, and the house's NRHP nomination form, the Ricketts brothers bought the lake and surrounding land in 1851, began building the stone house that year, and finished it in 1852. The year 1852 is also carved in stone on the front (west side) of the house, which faced the highway.See this photograph of the date 1852 carved on the front of the house. However, according to Tomasak's The Life and Times of Robert Bruce Ricketts, the brothers purchased the lake, tavern, and land on April 13, 1853, for $550 (approximately $ in ), and had the house built from 1854 to 1855.Tomasak, p. 38. According to Ricketts family tradition, Gad Seward built the mansion. While it was originally known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness, the official name was the Stone House. The house served as the brothers' lodge and as a tavern for travelers on the turnpike. Clemuel was named postmaster of a new post office at the lake on October 3, 1853, and received a tavern license from Sullivan County on August 7, 1854. When Clemuel died in 1858, Elijah bought his share of the house and land. The post office closed April 12, 1860.Ricketts, pp. 2‚Äì6.Petrillo, pp. 40‚Äì43.Tomasak, pp. 38‚Äì40. Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts (1839‚Äì1918), for whom the nearby Ricketts Glen State Park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. B. Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and purchased the stone house, lake, and some of the land around it from his father on September 25, 1869, for $3,969.81 (approximately $ in ); eventually he controlled or owned more than , including the lake and the park's glens and waterfalls.Petrillo, pp. 40, 77. From 1872 to 1875 Ricketts and his partners operated a sawmill southeast of his house. In 1872 Ricketts used lumber from the mill to build a three-story wooden addition about north of the stone house, with a verandah connecting the two. The addition cost $45,000 (approximately $ in ), and was known as the Ark for its resemblance to Noah's Ark. That same year Ricketts put new white birch floors in the stone house, which are still there as of 2008.Tomasak, pp. 83, 323. Hotel The North Mountain House hotel in the early 1870s; a verandah connected the wooden Ark (left) and stone house (right). The Ark and stone house together formed the North Mountain House hotel, which opened in 1873, and was managed by Ricketts' brother Frank until 1898. Many of the guests, who came from Wilkes-Barre, Philadelphia, New York City, and other places, were Ricketts' friends and relations. The hotel was open year-round; in summer, guests frequently arrived after school let out in June and stayed until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock, later known as the \\"Father of Forestry\\" in Pennsylvania. By 1874 Ricketts had renamed Long Pond as Highland Lake,Tomasak, p. 98. and by 1875 had named the highest waterfall on Kitchen Creek as Ganoga Falls.Bachelder, pp. 186‚Äì189.Tomasak, p. 85. That year the North Mountain House hotel was featured in John B. Bachelder's travel guide Popular resorts, and how to reach them, which praised its location in a virgin forest, the lake and nearby waterfalls, and opportunities for hunting, fishing, and hiking.Bachelder, pp. 184‚Äì192. In 1881, Ricketts renamed Highland Lake as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew suggested the name Ganoga, an Iroquoian word which he said meant \\"water on the mountain\\" in the Seneca language. 1875 woodcut by John B. Bachelder of hotel guests at the North Mountain House The house and hotel were on the east side of the old turnpike; a field on the other side of the road had a small herd of milk cows and a vegetable garden to provide for the guests' needs. The field also had a rifle range and a nine-hole golf course. Guests could enjoy tennis and croquet, and a lawn stretched from the house east to the lake, which offered boating and bathing. There was an outlook point southwest of the house, and Ricketts built a observation tower at the highest point on North Mountain, south. After the first tower collapsed, he built a replacement, and named the site Grand View.Tomasak, pp. 100, 323, 327. Ricketts was a lumberman who made his fortune clearcutting nearly all his land, but no logging was allowed within of the lake,Petrillo, pp. 50‚Äì55. and the glens and their waterfalls in the state park were \\"saved from the lumberman's axe through the foresight of the Ricketts family\\". One hemlock tree cut near the lake to clear land for a building in 1893 was in diameter and 532 years old. The North Mountain House hotel was threatened by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss of much of the surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. Changing tastes may have also played a role in the decline in popularity; the hotel had over 150 guests in August 1878, but only about 70 guests in August 1894.Tomasak, pp. 88, 323, 326, 328‚Äì329. The rear of the house with the two-story porch on the inside of the L; the wing added in 1913 is at far right. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the lumber town of Ricketts northeast of the lake. Beginning in 1893, a branch line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad ran from Ricketts to a log station at the north end of the lake; a boardwalk and coach service brought guests from the station to the hotel. There was daily passenger service to Wilkes-Barre and Towanda, and the line also served freight trains hauling ice from the lake for use in refrigeration from 1895.Tomasak, pp. 324, 328‚Äì329. The North Mountain House was long known for its rustic charms; it was heated with open fireplaces, decorated with animal skins and hatracks made of antlers, and had two live black bears on chains in the field across the road from the house. In 1895 and 1900 the stone house was refurbished, and telephone service, acetylene lighting, and steam heat were added.Tomasak, pp. 313‚Äì314, 324, 327‚Äì328. In 1900 The Sullivan Review newspaper recalled its former state and wrote of the changes: \\"We hardly call that an improvement. ... When the North Mountain House is lighted by gas, heated by a modern furnace, etc., its great charm is gone.\\"The Sullivan Review, November 1, 1900, quoted in Tomasak, p. 328. House The wooden addition to the stone house was torn down in either 1897 or 1903, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in November 1903, and passenger train service ended at that time. The sawmills at Ricketts closed when the timber was exhausted in 1913, and the ice company closed in 1915.Petrillo, pp. 1, 50, 53, 55 The stone house remained the Ricketts' summer home. Ricketts proposed moving the highway from his front yard in 1904; the Pennsylvania General Assembly approved this in 1908, after he paid for the construction of the new highway, east of the house. Thomas Henry Atherton of Wilkes-Barre was the architect for a new wing that was added to the stone house in 1913, as well as renovations to the original structure. Ricketts died in 1918 at the stone house; his wife died a few days after and they are buried in the small Ricketts family cemetery near the north end of the lake.Tomasak, p. 313. As part of Ricketts' will, the stone house and its outbuildings were valued at $12,000 in 1918 (approximately $ in ).Tomasak, p. 398. View from the northeast of the 1913 wing with its wrap-around kitchen porch; the original house is at left. R. B. Ricketts and his wife had three children; their son William Reynolds Ricketts (1869‚Äì1956) lived in the house after his parents' deaths. Beginning in 1920, the Ricketts heirs began selling land to the state of Pennsylvania, but still owned over surrounding the house, Ganoga Lake, and the glens with their waterfalls. The stone house was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in 1936 as the William R. Ricketts House. Atherton, the architect for the 1913 addition, helped prepare the HABS architectural drawings, which gave the house's name as \\"Ganoga\\". William Reynolds Ricketts' history for the HABS refers to it as the stone house.Tomasak, p. 332. The area was approved as a national park site in the 1930s; a 1935 article in The New York Times reported that the federal government planned to purchase in the area, mentioning the waterfalls and the Ricketts estate and house, which it called \\"the oldest stone hotel in Pennsylvania\\". The National Park Service operated a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at \\"Ricketts Glynn\\" (sic), but budget problems and World War II brought an end to national plans for development. In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began buying the glens and their waterfalls from the heirs for $82,000 (approximately $ in ) and opened Ricketts Glen State Park in 1944; from 1920 to 1950 the state bought more than from the Ricketts family for the park and Pennsylvania State Game Lands.Petrillo, p. 69. William Reynolds Ricketts died in 1956 and the lake and surrounding land were sold in October 1957 for $109,000 (approximately $ in ). The Department of Forests and Waters (predecessor of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources) bid on the including the house and lake, but were outbid by a group of private investors. These \\"formed the Lake Ganoga Association in September 1959 to regulate and preserve the recreation and residential facilities at Lake Ganoga\\".Petrillo, pp. 68‚Äì70. The association built a road around the lake, cleared some land at its southern end, and its members built about 50 houses on the lake shore. In 1983 the stone house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion;McDonald, pp. 1‚Äì6. it serves as the association's headquarters and clubhouse, and is used for association meetings, weddings, and picnics.Tomasak, pp. 376‚Äì377. As part of a private development, the house and lake are not open to the public: \\"To all outsiders that have no property around the lake, the lake and grounds are off limits.\\"Tomasak, p. 376. Architecture HABS alt=Black and white architectural diagram of an L-shaped building and a wing at top left. Clemuel Ricketts, the architect of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from the colonial period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year. The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion lies west of Ganoga Lake, on what the HABS map described as a \\"clearing completely surrounded by primeval forest\\", with a view to the lake. The house was originally on the east side of the turnpike and faced it, but when what became Pennsylvania Route 487 was built in 1907, the course of the highway was changed so that it now runs on the other (east) side of the lake. Since then, the house is on a private road from the highway. The original house built in the 1850s is L-shaped. According to the architectural drawings made for the HABS, the bottom of the L is north‚Äìsouth by east‚Äìwest. In 1935 the ground floor of this part of the house included the main door and entrance hall, living room, parlor, library, and stairs. The main entrance is on the west side, which has a porch wide by deep, supported by pairs of square pillars with stairs on the north, south, and west sides. The top of the L is north‚Äìsouth by east‚Äìwest, and in 1935 the ground floor of the top of the L had the dining room, gun room, \\"brush up room\\", toilet, stairs, and a passage to the 1913 addition. The inside corner of the L has a two-story covered porch along the south side, and an open terrace on the east side's ground floor. In 1935 the second story of the original house had four bedrooms and a bathroom in the lower part of the L and two bedrooms and a bath in the upper part, as well as two staircases and hallways. Federal style main door with a fanlight and sidelights, and sandstone walls alt=A green door in a white frame with a semi-circular window above with spider-web like rays. On either side of the door are windows with elaborate frameworks, along with two black lanterns, and stone walls. A rocking chair is at right. The mansion's stone walls are thick; the individual building stones are \\"field sandstone about 17 inches square, of various thicknesses\\" (17 inches is 43 cm). There is a basement below the original house. The lower part of the L is five bays by two bays; the original double-hung sash windows in each bay of the 1850s house have six panes of glass per sash. All the original windows have shutters, these are paneled on the first floor and louvered on the second. The main door is in the Federal style with a large fanlight above the door and sidelights on either side. The attic in the 1850s part of the house is not finished, and the gable roof has \\"boxed cornices with returns\\". In 1897 or 1903 a formal garden was added north of the stone house, on the site of the razed wooden structure where most of the hotel guests had stayed. In 1913 a two-and-half story wing was added on the north side of the original house, which was renovated; Thomas Henry Atherton was the architect. The new wing is north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest, with a large enclosed one-story porch on the north and east sides. In 1935 the addition had the kitchen, pantry, storage and refrigeration rooms, and a \\"maid's dining room\\" on the first floor, two bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor, and two servant rooms and a bath in the finished attic. The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers were added to the old house in the 1913 renovation (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows on the first floor of the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms. The NRHP nomination form lists two other structures on the property: a utility building made of brick and covered in stucco east of the house, and a large barn to the southwest. Since the house's 1913 renovation, the only changes have been the installation of electrical wiring and modernization of the plumbing. The original hardware and woodwork are still present inside the house. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion \\"is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture\\" which \\"represents the manifestations of one man's architectural dream preserved within the wilderness for over a century\\". Notes :a. All sources agree that the North Mountain House hotel closed in 1903, but differ on the date that the wooden addition used for the hotel was torn down. William Reynold's Ricketts' history for the HABS and Petrillo's book both report it was razed in 1897, while McDonald's NRHP nomination form and Tomasak's book give the year as 1903. :b. According to Tomasak's book, this utility building served as William Reynolds Ricketts library, and was where he worked on his stamp collection. Later, it served as the office from which the Ganoga Lake Association sold lots around the lake. Follow these links for photographs of the utility building and of the barn.

It ran from July 20, 2010 to October 28, 2010, involving four driverless vehicles driving with virtually no human intervention on an almost trip from Parma, Italy to Shanghai, China.\\"Without driver or map, vans go from Italy to China\\", Elaine Kurtenbac, AP.COM \\"Driverless van crosses from Europe to Asia\\", Jo Ling Kent, CNN.COM Overview The 2010 World Expo's theme was ‚Äúbetter cities, better life‚Äù; therefore issues related to sustainable mobility were central to the Expo and this challenge of reaching Shanghai with driverless vehicles provided a clear demonstration of future vehicles; it is considered one of the main milestones in Robotics. VisLab, thanks to a project partially funded by ERC -the European Research Council- showed that one day it will be possible to move goods between two continents with non-polluting vehicles powered by green energy and with virtually no human intervention. Goods were packed in Parma and taken to Shanghai on driverless vehicles for the first time in history. The idea The aim was to test and stress the current technology in a unique event: non-polluting and non-oil based autonomous vehicles in real traffic conditions on an extreme journey between two continents, the final outcome being a huge dataset with a very large variety of situations to be further used to refine the onboard perception system. Technical details The trip traversed remote areas in Russia, Kazakhstan, and China, for which no map was available; due to the length of the trip it was also impossible to check and test the route in advance. Therefore, VisLab defined the following behavior. The first vehicle drove autonomously in selected sections of the trip, conducting experimental tests on sensing, decision, and control subsystems, and continuously collecting data. Human interventions were needed on a regular basis to define the route and intervene in critical situations. The second vehicle automatically followed the route defined by the leader vehicle by following it either visually or thanks to GPS waypoints sent by the leader vehicle, therefore requiring no human intervention (100% autonomous). This is regarded as a readily exploitable vehicle, able to move on predefined routes. During the trip, demonstrations were scheduled in specific hot spots, showing autonomous vehicles following given routes, negotiating traffic, avoiding obstacles, and stopping when required. The first demonstration was held in Rome at the EUR district on October 29, 2009, when Rome's Major, Gianni Alemanno, officially presented the VIAC challenge. The last demonstration was given exactly one year later, on Oct 28, 2010, in Shanghai, China, during a parade at the World Expo, organized by the European Pavilion. Although the vehicles were electric and had solar panels on the roof, propulsion was not powered by the solar panels but by the original vehicle's batteries which were charged at power outlets or, when no power outlet was available, by generators. The solar panels powered the autonomous driving system (sensors, processing engines, actuators, radios, GPS,..). Worldwide Milestone and Data Analysis The VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge is considered a unique milestone in vehicular robotics, just like the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 and the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007. The vehicles collected about 50 terabytes of data to be used in the future for further processing off-line. Organization and Logistics The logistics were managed by Overland Network, which provided 4 RVs (motor homes) and 3 additional trucks as a support. The expedition was therefore formed by 4 autonomous vehicles, 4 RVs, 3 trucks, and occupied about 20 people for three months. A satellite link broadcast live data and video streaming for the whole duration of the trip (except in China) so that everybody on the Internet was able to witness the progress of the experiment.

Friday, 28 June 2019 History The service was first launched in 1999 by David Elms, who came up with the idea after having what he described as a \\"bad encounter\\" with a call girl. The Erotic Review website was acquired by Treehouse Park in 2004. On April 6, 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act; following this and the FBI shutting down Backpage and other websites promoting or facilitating in prostitution, The Erotic Review blocked access to its site from the United States until December 2019, though it could still be accessed in the United States via a VPN. On July 25, 2018, The Erotic Review was mentioned in a superseding indictment filed by the government against Backpage.com. The superseding indictment alleges that Backpage and The Erotic Review had a reciprocal link agreement, where both parties allowed ads to be posted on their sites. The indictment alleges that Backpage paid ‚Äútens of thousands‚Äù of dollars to The Erotic Review for this agreement. On December 19, 2019 The Erotic Review again opened access to the United States without needing VPN, restoring previously hidden USA escort reviews and allowing new USA escort reviews to be posted. Content and readership A 2008 River Front Times article features Elms commenting that the average site-user was \\"between 35 and 55 years old with a median income of $80,000\\". The Erotic Review hosts reviews for over 90 cities around the world. The site offers both a free and paid membership. Free members can access site features such as the discussion boards and a limited search function. Paid members have additional features such as the ability to access complete reviews and a search page that allows the user to search based on various criteria such as physical attributes. Criticism The site has been met with criticism, most of which centered upon its founder. Some critics have claimed that Elms has accepted bribes to promote certain agencies or call girls and has pressured others into providing sexual favors. Others have made claims of Elms threatening them with bodily harm for criticizing the site or refusing to provide sexual services. Elms denied the claims.

He taught at the school Trondhjems Fagskole, was a board member of the Norwegian Association of Professional Photographers from 1913, and became an honorary member in 1937.

A right-hand batsman and a wicketkeeper, Sidwell made 392 appearances for Leicestershire County Cricket Club between 1913 and 1933. His 551 catches and 127 stumpings were a county record until beaten by Roger Tolchard, and his keeping skill made him a rival of incumbent national keeper Herbert Strudwick though Sidwell was never selected for England. Two of his three centuries came in the 1928 season where he hit 1,153 runs, and he batted in both the lower and top order. Career Sidwell first played for Leicestershire in 1913, debuting on 12 July against Warwickshire. Batting at number nine, he made seven runs before taking two catches and a stumping as William Shipman routed the opposition without Leicestershire having to bat again. Sidwell made four more appearances for his county that season. The following year he was taken on the staff and appeared in the full 22 matches, scoring 315 runs, taking 34 catches and making six stumpings. His career was then interrupted by the First World War, the outbreak of which in August 1914 led to the early termination of the 1914 County Championship, and no further first-class cricket was played for the duration of the war. The County Championship resumed in 1919, when he played 15 games, taking 27 more catches and five more stumpings, followed by 34 catches and 10 stumpings in 1920. He would become a regular on the team list for the rest of his career. Sent in on one occasion during 1921 as a nightwatchman, Sidwell survived until morning. However while travelling to the ground - The Oval in Surrey - for the next day's play, he became lost on the London Underground and was given out while mid-transit. The resulting disagreement between the cricket administrative body and Surrey's captain Percy Fender created a minor media stir. Though he never made an international appearance, Sidwell played for the Rest of England and the North of England in 1922 and 1923 respectively, and appeared in a first-class England XI in 1929. He enjoyed a benefit season with his club in 1926, where he played 28 matches, scoring 892 runs at 22.30 (with his only other century), taking 36 and performing nine stumpings. Two years later in 1928 he hit 1,153 runs - a career best - including the two centuries and five half-centuries. He retired after the 1931 season, but reappeared in 1933 when Percy Corrall, his replacement as Leicestershire wicketkeeper, was injured, making 13 appearances. Between 1914 and 1931 he only missed six matches. He went on to play club cricket until 1957.

Its popularity increased because a major character in Goethe's Faust (1808) has this name. In German, the Gretchenfrage (question by Gretchen), derived from Faust, is an idiom for a direct question that aims at the core of a problem and that should reveal the intentions and mindset of the questioned. The question is usually inconvenient to the questioned since he or she shall confess to something crucial he or she was intentionally or unintentionally vague about before. In German-speaking countries, Gretchen is not a common stand-alone given name but rather a colloquial diminutive form of Grete (Greta), which itself is a short form Margarete.

The stories contained span the course of his career, from \\"Advice to Young Girls\\" in 1865 to the titular tale in 1904. Although Twain had ample time to refine his short stories between their original publication date and this collection, there is little evidence to suggest he took an active interest in doing so. \\"A Burlesque Biography\\" contains only a few minor technical revisions which make it different from the 1871 version found in Mark Twain's \\"(Burlesque) Autobiography and First Romance\\". \\"Advice to Little Girls\\" shows slight revision from its earlier publication in The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County. \\"A History of and Guide to Uniform Editions of Mark Twain's Works\\" by Barbara Schmidt Publication history In September 1906, Harper and Brothers created another collection of previously published short stories and essays by Mark Twain. They compiled two separate versions of this collection: a trade print issued in red cloth binding with gold cornstalks and an ongoing series for subscription book buyers who had first purchased their sets from American Publishing Company in 1899. By 1906, the American Publishing Company sets contained material that had not yet been incorporated in any of Harper's previous uniform series of books with red cloth bindings. With the publication of The $30,000 Bequest and Other Stories, Harper had the opportunity to even the offerings. Twain did not want either collection to contain duplicate material and ultimately approved Frederick Leigh's plan for the new volume's contents. \\"A History of and Guide to Uniform Editions of Mark Twain's Works\\" by Barbara Schmidt In order to accommodate the purchasers of American Publishing Company's uniform editions (issued from 1899‚Äì1903), Harper and Brothers bound Volume 24 to match the previous bindings of the earlier editions. Each volume for previous American Publishing Company customers contained the following statement: \\"This edition is printed by Harper & Brothers, the exclusive publishers of Mark Twain's works, as an accommodation to purchasers of earlier volumes with a view to making their sets uniform\\". It was up to the former buyers of the American Publishing uniform editions to continue adding volumes to their sets. However, a number of buyers stopped collecting the books.

Favela Santa Marta (, Saint Martha's favela) is a favela located in the Botafogo and Laranjeiras part of the Morro Dona Marta (, Dame Martha's Hill), that is also divided with the neighborhoods of Flamengo, Cosme Velho and Silvestre, in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It has about 8000 residents, with 500 wooden houses, 2000 brick houses, 4 kindergartens, 3 bakeries, 2 sports fields, 1 block of a samba school, 3 military units and 1 small market. The favela is one of the steepest in the city. Recently, the favela has been undergoing a process of urbanization. Several popular houses were built with sewage, water piping and installation of electrical cables. One of the most important works done in recent years in Dona Marta was the construction of a cable car that facilitates the transport of residents to higher areas of the hill. Another major change in Dona Marta was the occupation of military force. On November 28, 2008 the control of Dona Marta was turned to civil police forces when Rio's first Pacifying Police Unit was established there. Between 2008 and 2015, the military operation was considered a success in combating trafficking and reducing local violence. However, the UPP project left the community without the consolidation of an independent local peace structure, and thus vilolence returned even more destructive. The vacuum of power added to the harmed military armament created a scenario of 2 shootings between gangs per week. Rio de Janeiro'S government decided to re-intervene in the community dynamics, but the pacification policing was replaced by confrontation policing, with emphasis on the use of the units of the Special Operations Shock battalions (BOPE). Trafficking settled in parts of the community defending themselves with pistols and rifles, similar to other areas in RJ. Entrepreneurs have left the community, and social projects are in decline. The change in the police brought problems to the residents, as they would repress cultural artistic movements, street events and even the local commerce and day-care centers to function normally. This is reflected in the visits of tourists to the hill. In the post- installation period of the UPP, there were 2,000 per month. Currently, they do not reach 200, according to tour guides. . Dona Marta was the setting for international events as part of the clip of \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" by Michael Jackson and appearances in Bike Downhill MTB of Redbull and the film Fast Five.

Turntable anti-skating is a feature used in phonograph turntables to prevent skating of the tonearm. Due to the offset between the cartridge's axis (which is approximately tangential to the disc) and the tonearm's pivot, the force applied (through friction) by the rotating disc to the cartridge tends to draw the tonearm toward the center of the record and distort the balance of the sound and of the wear suffered by the stylus and the vinyl groove. To prevent this, an appropriately-sized opposing force (a rotational torque) is applied at the tonearm. This is accomplished in various ways by dedicated mechanisms, depending on the tonearm's manufacturer, and ranging from a small counterweight adjustable by a knob, to adjustable spring or magnetic mechanisms, usually calibrated in grams of force. Note that while the angular velocity is, ideally, constant, the peripheral velocity of the moving groove against the stylus is not, varying for instance from approximately 50 cm/s down to 15 cm/s from start to finish of a 33 rpm, 12\\" (30.48cm) record. The angle of skew of the stylus cartridge with respect to a chord of the circular record (and groove) while the tonearm rests on the record is also variable. Thus, any opposing force applied to the tonearm to counteract skating, if not variable during the playing of the record, is fixed, and at best an average value, only really perfectly in balance with the skating force at just one unique radius from the center of the disk. Yet, anti-skating schemes perform a useful function in minimizing asymmetric wear of styli and grooves, although not eliminating it entirely. Linear-tracking turntables were invented in part to eliminate the possibility of skating.

He was also the first to establish a horticultural training school in India.  Life and work  Carte-de-visite from Krumbiegel's English period Krumbiegel was born in Lohmen near Dresden, and his early studies were in Wilsdruff and Dresden after which he trained in horticulture in Pillnitz. In 1884 he worked in Schwerin and from 1885 to 1887 he worked as a landscape gardener in Hamburg. In 1888, he moved to England, designing flower beds at Hyde Park and became a staff at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew. He then took up a position in 1893 with the princely state of Baroda as Curator of the botanical gardens after the retirement of J.M. Henry (1841-1937). He also worked with the Government Botanical Gardens at Ootacamund and was responsible for redesign of the architecture. In 1907 he took a better offer from Krishnaraja Wodeyar, the ruler of Mysore to serve him and he succeeded John Cameron at the Lal Bagh Gardens as an economic botanist and superintendent. He introduced numerous plants and was involved in the design of the Brindavan Gardens which revived the Mughal style of gardening. He was also involved with the Mysore Horticultural Society that was started in 1912. Although outside his key work area, he was often involved in architectural design. The Dewan of Mysore appointed him as an architectural consultant despite protests from the British Resident in Mysore. During the Second World War, Germans in India were declared as enemies and Krumbiegel was, along with other Germans, held at an internment camp in Bangalore.Letter from Chief Secretary to H.

The term also refers to the subsequent political scandal the article caused in Socialist Republic of Serbia, a constituent federal unit of SFR Yugoslavia. Written using what on surface appears to be light humorous tone, the article viciously went after prominent Serbian intellectual and communist veteran of Spanish Civil War and World War II Gojko Nikoli≈° by tendentiously bringing up and value judging various aspects of his career and personal life in an effort to defame him. The article also mentions another prominent intellectual Pavle Saviƒá, however, in contrast to the strong denouncement of Nikoli≈° throughout the piece, Saviƒá is only slightly ridiculed. All this was done in somewhat veiled manner as their actual names were never mentioned in the article. Both Nikoli≈° and Saviƒá were prominent Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) members at the time. In the years since, information came out that State Security (SDB) and political leadership of SR Serbia at the time were very much involved in creating the article and planting it in the high-circulation newspaper amid the political fallout caused by leaked SANU Memorandum excerpts that ended up in the Serbian press during September 1986. Since the immediate writer of \\"Vojko i Savle\\" was never discovered with certainty, the issue led to a lot of speculation and accusations over the years. The entire shady episode and the scandal it caused is today regarded as one of the most obvious examples of political elites and security apparatus using the press as a political instrument during the final years of socialist Yugoslavia.Politika falsifikata; Vreme, 23 January 1999 Background At the time when the article got published, the relations between SANU and Serbian political leadership were already strained for quite some time, mostly over the controversial SANU Memorandum that was leaked to the press in September 1986. Because of the Memorandum, the political leadership of SR Serbia was under pressure from the political leaders of other Yugoslav constituent republics, mostly SR Croatia and SR Slovenia, to deliver a strong public denouncement of the controversial document. Complicating matters even further was the simmering behind-the-scenes personal political battle between SR Serbia's top two political authorities at the time ‚Äî experienced Ivan Stamboliƒá (president of SR Serbia's presidency) and surging Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá (at the time president of SR Serbia's Communist League's Central Committee) ‚Äì as well as their seemingly different reactions to SANU Memorandum and to growing Serbian nationalism in general. As the biggest political authority in Serbia at the time, Stamboliƒá condemned the Memorandum immediately (meaning that such a stance became official Serbian policy), while Milo≈°eviƒá kept silent and avoided doing the same for a long time. He was eventually pressured by Stamboliƒá into condemning the Memorandum, and Milo≈°eviƒá finally did it during summer 1987 in a public speech at Bela Crkva as part of memorial festivities for July 7 holiday.Dusan Stupar;ƒÜirilica, 14 February 2011 In the decades since, information came out that Serbian State Security (which kept extensive files on each individual involved in public life) played an integral part in the entire \\"Vojko i Savle\\" episode by providing personal information on Nikoli≈° and Saviƒá to Serbian political leadership that later ordered the piece to be written using that info. As Milo≈°eviƒá vs. Stamboliƒá political battle intensified throughout 1987 and eventually had its finale played out in September 1987 at the now infamous 8th Sitting of SR Serbia's Communist League, Milo≈°eviƒá tried to get people from State Security to accuse Stamboliƒá and his political ally Dragi≈°a Pavloviƒá of being behind the entire sordid episode because he wanted to show that they used the media in order to defame SANU membership. The name of the actual individual who wrote the piece never came out because none of the parties involved were willing to talk about it. Article On Sunday, 18 January 1987, Politika daily newspaper (under editor-in-chief ≈Ωika Minoviƒá at the time) published a humorous piece (humoreska) headlined \\"Vojko i Savle\\". Though using jovial tone, it strongly denounces the seemingly fictional retiree named \\"Vojko Nikoliƒá\\" by maliciously discussing his personal life, specifically going after his spouse, living arrangements, financial wealth, current love life, and past romantic liaisons. Another fictional retiree named \\"Savle Paviƒá\\" is also mentioned in the piece, but the extent of his denouncement is not as strong. The article mainly focuses on \\"Vojko\\", decorated Yugoslav Partisan participant of the People's Liberation Struggle during World War II, implying that despite today coming off as a retiree of modest means, he in fact owns multiple lavish seaside properties along with an account in a Swiss bank. The article then turns to \\"Vojko\\"'s past diplomatic service in an unnamed southern Asian country where he married a woman named \\"Argo\\" whom he met during the long boat ride on the way there. Stopping just short of stating it explicitly, the article then implies that \\"Argo\\" is a foreign spy and that during his diplomatic service \\"Vojko\\" had a habit of losing suitcases full of papers containing important information. Although supposedly talking about fictional characters, anyone who followed public life in Serbia at the time could easily deduce that the pseudo-satirical piece is actually referring to Academician Gojko Nikoli≈° who was a World War II veteran for which he received the gallantry medal of Yugoslav people's hero; he was also former Yugoslav ambassador to India during the early 1950s where he met his future wife - a Frenchwoman named Margot. Similarly, it is obvious from information provided that the character of \\"Savle\\" is SANU president Pavle Saviƒá. The article's writer was signed as \\"M. ≈†arenac\\", however it was soon discovered that no such person exists on Politika's staff nor does such person exist among the citizens of Belgrade.Kriza prva: skaredna humoreska; Republika, Immediate reaction=Politika journalists Joining the negative public response that \\"Vojko i Savle\\" caused, 67 Politika journalists came out with a petition calling the article's inclusion in the paper \\"an egregious editorial blunder\\" while urging editor-in-chief Minoviƒá to \\"reveal the name of the article's author as well as to, together with his editorial staff, take personal responsibility for allowing such an unseemly and distasteful text into the paper\\".Sunovrat;Republika, 1997 Soon after that, those Politika journalists got support from 47 more colleagues employed at other Politika AD publications. ≈Ωika Minoviƒá The pressure on Minoviƒá grew both from within and from the outside as the print media wrote extensively and extremely critically about the scandal. As a result, the scandal became a topic of discussion at Politika's internal Party-initiated meeting (worker meetings under the Communist Party auspices were regularly held in Yugoslav state-owned or self-managed companies). Faced with a barrage of heavy criticism at the meeting, Minoviƒá promised to publicly apologize to both Nikoli≈° and Saviƒá, which was one of the meeting's conclusions. However, instead of his apology, the next day 14 February 1987, Politika published the following text - conceptualized as an \\"Explanation\\", it read: Such an apology that wasn't, satisfied no one. Serbian Journalists' Association Reacting to Minoviƒá's \\"Explanation\\", the Serbian Journalists' Association (UNS), headed by Jug Grizelj (at that time also the editor-in-chief of NIN, another one of Politika AD's publications), summoned its internal body, sud ƒçasti (court of honour), at which it concluded that Politika editorial board should carry out an internal investigation and establish specific and personal responsibility for the individuals that allowed the text to appear. Politika's board, for its part, ignored that recommendation, choosing to defer to its already published \\"Explanation\\" thus refusing to individualize the responsibility for what itself referred to as \\"an oversight\\". Gojko Nikoli≈° At this point 75-year-old Gojko Nikoli≈° decided to react publicly by writing an open letter to Politika's editor-in-chief ≈Ωika Minoviƒá. Minoviƒá refused to publish the letter in Politika, but in late April 1987 it appeared in weekly magazine Mladost and after that in most of the Yugoslav print media outlets. Writing in accusatory tone, Nikoli≈° states: Investigation On 4 June 1987, the Politika organization formed a commission tasked with finding out who wrote the controversial article and how it found its way into the paper. Following an investigation that lasted twenty days, the commission concluded that it is not possible to ascertain precisely who had written the text \\"Vojko i Savle\\" and how, or on whose orders, it had reached Politika.from the article \\"Politika in the Storm of Nationalism\\" by Aleksandar Nenadoviƒá, originally published in Republika, then reprinted in the book The Road to War in Serbia: Trauma and Catharsis, edited by Neboj≈°a Popov, Central European University Press, Budapest-New York, 2000, P. 540 Still, the commission's final report contained a conclusion that neither the editor-in-chief ≈Ωika Minoviƒá nor his close associates had \\"respected elementary editorial obligations\\", which \\"in the case of the editor-in-chief meant that he allowed his newspaper to be edited from outside\\".\\"Report on the Case of Vojko and Savle\\", NIN, 29 September 1987 In 1988, the Communist League's City of Belgrade Committee, now under new pro-Milo≈°eviƒá leadership following his power takeover in Serbia at the 8th Session conducted its own investigation regarding the \\"Vojko i Savle\\" scandal. The internal document written by its analytical service names top politicians Nikola Ljubiƒçiƒá, Du≈°an ƒåkrebiƒá, and Petar Stamboliƒá (together with his nephew Ivan Stamboliƒá) as the originators of the idea to write the article, which they thought up in fall 1986 soon after the SANU Memorandum excerpts appeared in the press. The document further claims their motivation to do so was smearing SANU by defaming its prominent member Gojko Nikoli≈°. The document goes on to mention that after the president of Serbian presidency Stamboliƒá accepted the idea, he got his close personal friend and political ally Dragi≈°a Pavloviƒá, the president of Communist League's Belgrade Committee to prepare some compromising material on Nikoli≈°. Pavloviƒá got his material from Du≈°an Stupar, the head of city of Belgrade UDBA branch, commissioning novelist Milenko Vuƒçetiƒá to produce a rough draft of the text. Vuƒçetiƒá's text was later honed by Vidosav Stevanoviƒá and then delivered to Politika by the executive secretary for information at the Communist League's Belgrade city committee Radmilo Kljajiƒá (also a journalist and former Politika staffer).Sudbina jedne humoreske Recent reaction=≈Ωika Minoviƒá In fall 2007, ≈Ωika Minoviƒá's book titled Gojko i Pavle - istorija izvesnih i neoƒçekivanih uzroka Osme sednice (Gojko and Pavle: History of Predictable and Unpredictable Causes of the Eight Sitting) got published.Gojko i Pavle Though many expected Minoviƒá to finally disclose the name(s) of the author(s) of \\"Vojko i Savle\\" as well as to possibly fill the public in on other unknown details surrounding the scandal, the 500-page book actually contains very little concrete information and mostly concentrates on Minoviƒá's own supposed opposition to Milo≈°eviƒá's regime. Written in general and evasive style, the book has been criticized as \\"Minoviƒá's unconvincing and unsuccessful attempt at distancing himself from Milo≈°eviƒá's politics after the fact\\" and \\"being more intent on whitewashing his own biography than providing an insider account about the people behind one of the biggest political and cultural scandals of the 20th century's final decades\\".Nova tumaƒçenja sluƒçaja humoreske ‚ÄûVojko i Savle‚Äú objavljene u Politici pre 23 godine: ≈Ωika protiv ≈Ωike;Danas, 2008 Insajder On October 2, 2008, in B92 television's Insajder programme, Du≈°an Stupar, chief of State Security branch for the city of Belgrade from 1984 until 1987, claimed that writer Vidosav Stevanoviƒá wrote the piece using the information on Nikoli≈° and Saviƒá that the State Security provided to Serbian political leadership. Stupar went on to add that as a reward for the job well done, his political sponsors in this endeavour arranged for Stevanoviƒá to receive the NIN Prize. When contacted by the programme, Stevanoviƒá didn't want to appear on-camera, but issued a statement denying Stupar's claims and also announced his intention to sue Stupar for libel and defamation of character.Insajder; B92 Though his name was mentioned numerous times before as the writer of \\"Vojko i Savle\\", this was the first time Stevanoviƒá decided to start a legal proceeding against the individual making that claim. In September 2009, the Second Municipal Court in Belgrade ruled in plaintiff Stevanoviƒá's favour, ordering defendant Stupar to pay RSD300,000 (~‚Ç¨3,000) in damages.Stevanoviƒá nije napisao humoresku \\"Vojko i Savle\\";RFE/RL, 25 September 2011 ƒÜirilica During February 2011, Stupar again talked about the \\"Vojko i Savle\\" scandal - this time on Milomir Mariƒá's ƒÜirilica talk show on Happy TV. Stupar reiterated that the details from Nikoli≈°' and Saviƒá's personal lives were supplied by the Security Service in response to a request that came from the political circles. This time Stupar went further, revealing that it was general Nikola Ljubiƒçiƒá who initiated the idea for a defamatory piece on Nikoli≈° and Saviƒá to be written and published in Politika. Stupar went on to add he was told this by Dragi≈°a Pavloviƒá and Ivan Stamboliƒá.ƒÜirilica;Happy TV, May 2011 References Category:Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Category:20th-century scandals Category:1987 in Yugoslavia Category:1987 documents Category:Magazine articles ","title":"Vojko i Savle"},{"id":"26905146","text":"The Tamil National Liberation Alliance (TNLA) was a Sri Lankan political alliance representing the Sri Lankan Tamil ethnic minority in the country.

Biography Germanus is possibly the same as the dux of Phoenice, who was chosen by the army as its leader during the mutiny at Monocarton in Easter 588, in place of Priscus. Although Germanus restored discipline and led the army to a victory against the Persians, he was tried and found guilty by a subsequent tribunal. Sentenced to death, he was quickly pardoned and received rewards from Emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602).; . In 602, shortly before the outbreak of the revolt against Emperor Maurice that brought Phocas to power, Germanus was placed in command of the strategically important fortress of Dara in Mesopotamia.. In early 603, he received Lilius, the envoy Phocas had sent to announce his accession to the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590‚Äì628). At this time, Germanus was reportedly attacked and wounded by one of his soldiers, but soon recovered.. In late 603, Narses, the Byzantine commander-in-chief of the eastern armies, rebelled against Phocas. He failed to secure the support of most of the army, and Germanus was ordered to besiege him at his base at Edessa. Narses, however, had sought and obtained the support of Khosrau II, who was eager to regain lost territory and avenge the murder of Emperor Maurice, who had helped him regain his throne in 591.. Khosrau therefore sent a Persian army into Mesopotamia. Germanus met the Persians in battle near the city of Constantina, but was defeated and heavily wounded, dying a few days after in Constantina..

It was a single-engined, low-wing monoplane that was designed as a catapult-launched reconnaissance aircraft to operate from warships of the French Navy. Two flew in 1940, and a third aircraft was built to a modified design in 1941, but no production followed. Development and design The Dewoitine HD.730 was designed by Emile Dewoitine's team at the Soci√©t√© nationale des constructions a√©ronautiques du Midi (SNCAM), which was formed in 1937 when Dewoitine's Soci√©t√© A√©ronautique Fran√ßaise was nationalised, in order to meet a French Navy requirement for a light catapult-launched observation aircraft, with two prototypes ordered in 1938. It was a low-wing monoplane of all-metal stressed-skin construction. It was fitted with an inverted gull-wing, which folded immediately outboard of the twin floats to aid storage on board ship, and it had twin tail fins. The two-man crew or pilot and observer sat in tandem under an enclosed canopy. The observer was armed with a single flexibly mounted machine gun, and a fixed machine gun was operated by the pilot. It was powered by a single 164 kW (220 hp) Renault 6Q inverted six-cylinder air-cooled piston engine driving a two-blade propeller.Green 1962, pp. 18‚Äì19. The first prototype flew in February 1940, with the second following in May. Testing showed that it was underpowered, and it was proposed that the planned 40 production aircraft would be use a 261 kW (350 hp) B√©arn 6D. These plans were stopped by the French surrender in June 1940, with the two prototypes being stored.Green 1962, p.19. Despite the Armistice, development continued, with a significantly revised third prototype being built by the Soci√©t√© nationale des constructions a√©ronautiques du Sud- Est (SNCASE) at Marignane, the HD.731.01. This was powered by a B√©arn 6D and was smaller than the HD.730, with a wingspan of 10.21 m (33 ft 6 in) compared with 12.60 m (41 ft 4 in) for the HD.730. In order to avoid Axis controls on the production of military aircraft, it was officially described as a commercial liaison aircraft for use in France's overseas colonies, but despite this, it was still fitted with folding wings. It made its maiden flight on 11 March 1941,Parmentier, B. \\"Dewoitine HD-731 - Hydravion d'observation\\". Aviafrance - Un si√®cle d'aviation fran√ßaise. Retrieved 10 April 2010. but testing revealed that its wings were too small and the HD.731 was abandoned. SNACSE meanwhile resumed work on the HD.730, refitting the second prototype with a B√©arn 6D, testing starting again in July 1941 and continuing until being prohibited by the Italian Control commission in December.Green 1962, pp. 19‚Äì20. Work on the HD.730 restarted again after the German retreat from the south of France, with the second prototype being fitted with a single fin and rudder, flying again on 21 July 1945. While testing was successful, the French Navy now had no need for a catapult floatplane, as catapults had been removed from its ships, and although consideration was given to using the type as a trainer, the SCAN 20 was selected instead and the HD-730 was abandoned.Green 1962, pp. 20‚Äì22.

Five were tropical storms and three were hurricanes, with winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) or greater. The first storm was a tropical storm which formed near the Turks & Caicos Islands on August 1\\\\. It traveled parallel to the US east coast to make landfall in New Brunswick on August 5\\\\. The second storm of the season formed as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on September 14\\\\. It developed into a Category 1 hurricane which first struck Louisiana on September 18, then Florida the next day before dissipating in the Atlantic on September 21\\\\. Hurricane Three was a Category 1 hurricane that existed between September 16 and 22 without making landfall. Hurricane Four was the strongest and most destructive storm of the season and impacted both Venezuela and Florida. Most notably, Hurricane Four caused 84 fatalities in the United States. Tropical Storm Five existed between September 24 and September 29 in which period it traveled from north of Hispaniola to a point off the south-east coast of the United States. Tropical Storm Six existed for a few days in mid-October without making landfall. Tropical Storm Seven formed in the western Gulf of Mexico, tracked parallel to the US Gulf coast and crossed the Florida peninsula between October 24 and October 28\\\\. The last storm of the season was known to have existed for two days in November. It dissipated off the Newfoundland coast on November 29\\\\. Systems=Tropical Storm One A tropical storm was first observed to the north of Turks and Caicos Islands on August 1\\\\. It tracked along the eastern edge of the Bahamas, before paralleling the east coast of the United States. By August 2, the tropical storm was nearly a hurricane, though records show that winds never exceeded 70 mph (113 km/h). It gradually weakened as it headed generally north. The storm finally made landfall in New Brunswick as a 60 mph (96 km/h) tropical storm on August 5.Later it dissipated as it emerged into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Hurricane Two A tropical storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 14\\\\. On September 16 it reached peak intensity as an 80 mph (129 km/h) hurricane while it was within 120 miles (193 km) of the Texas coast. Although heavy rain and high tides were seen all along the Texas coast, the hurricane veered eastward, so avoiding a landfall in Texas. However, on September 18 it made landfall in Louisiana while at the same strength. On September 19 the hurricane made another landfall at Fort Walton Beach, Florida. It quickly weakened back to a tropical storm while still in the state of Florida. It emerged into the Atlantic on September 20\\\\. The storm dissipated about 200 miles south of North Carolina on September 21. Hurricane Three A Category 1 hurricane was first discovered on September 16 in the mid-North Atlantic. It moved generally to the northwest for a few days then passed safely to the northeast of Bermuda between September 18 and 19th. It weakened to a tropical storm as it was moving toward Atlantic Canada. It dissipated while just offshore of southern Newfoundland. The storm is known to have reached hurricane strength from ship reports, most notably from the Harley John, and wind reports from St. Paul Island, Canada Hurricane Four On September 21, a tropical storm was first observed east of the Leeward Islands. It moved west at a low latitude, hugging the coast of South America while strengthening. It crossed over northern Venezuela on the September 23, becoming one of just a few tropical systems to hit that country. The island of Cura√ßao was devastated. The hurricane turned northward, weakening to a minimal Category 1 storm. It crossed the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, where it strengthened to a 115 mph (185 km/h) major hurricane just before landfall at Panama City Beach, Florida, on October 3\\\\. It caused a storm tide of at St. Marks, Florida. The storm became extratropical over the Carolinas on October 4. The storm caused heavy rain and flooding throughout North Carolina. Numerous ships were wrecked along the United States Atlantic coast. Overall, the hurricane was responsible for 84 deaths. Tropical Storm Five On September 24 a tropical storm was discovered north of Hispaniola. It tracked through the Bahamas over the next few days. After passing the Bahamas, it moved parallel to the southeastern coast of the United States.The storm reached peak intensity on September 28\\\\. It apparently dissipated on September 29. Tropical Storm Six A tropical storm was discovered roughly halfway between Bermuda and the Cape Verde Islands on October 13\\\\. It headed generally northward and did not strengthen. It became extratropical to the southeast of Cape Race on October 16\\\\. This extratropical storm lasted until October 18. Tropical Storm Seven A tropical storm was first discovered on October 24 in the Gulf of Mexico. It paralleled the states of the Gulf Coast for a few days before ultimately making landfall near Cedar Key, Florida, as a tropical storm. The storm later strengthened slightly but dissipated on October 28. Tropical Storm Eight A tropical storm was discovered in the vicinity of the Bahamas on November 28\\\\.

Brock has taught sociology and women's studies at Ryerson Polytechnic University, Wilfrid Laurier University, and Trent University. She completed her M.A. at Carleton University in 1984 and her Ph.D. at the University of Toronto in 1990. She is currently an associate professor (Arts) at York University and she teaches Crime and Criminological Theory; Social Regulation; Gender and Sexualities; Historical Sociology.  Overview of research  Brock has written mostly about prostitution in Canada. She sees prostitution as an occupation rather than a crime because women are using their bodies as commodities. However, she explains how the laws against bawdy houses make sure that prostitution goes back to the streets where it has been criminalized. It is on the streets where prostitutes are seen as immoral and are prosecuted. If sex workers were able to do their work in a secure, less criminalized area they would not be visible and therefore would not be seen as immoral and in turn prosecuted much less. She does definitely make the distinction between adult sex work and that of juvenile sex work because adults can consent to the activity and many use it as a source of employment however most of the time juveniles are exploited by older people in a position of power. Brock explains that societies panic surrounding sex and morality has enabled Canada to still criminalized sex work and prostitution.  Major works  Brock, Deborah. 1998. Making Work, Making Trouble: Prostitution as a Social Problem. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. Making work making trouble looks at how prostitution was made to be a social problem and a moral panic. Brock wonders why sex work is seen as a problem and for whom is it a problem. Chapter two focuses on how the murder of a young boy started a moral panic and the media made prostitution seem as though it was a big social problem. The government then got into it and started to shut places down and arrest people. Prostitution was used as a scapegoat for the young boy's death. Chapter three focuses on the problems with how to regulate street prostitution because of the definitions of who is a prostitute, what is a public place, what is solicitation, etc. The media and different groups start to make a big deal out of a small issues and soon everybody wants more police and more jails which leads to more criminal records which forces women to sell their bodies because they cannot get another job. Basically moral and discriminatory bias is punishing the most disadvantaged women - those who work the streets- while doing nothing to understand why they are there in the first place. Chapter four looks at the creation of the special committee on pornography and Prostitution (The Fraser Committee), its mandates, its goals and its recommendations. Chapter five looks at bill C-49 which attempted to restrict the communication for the purpose of prostitution. Restricting the communication for the purpose of prostitution did not work to get the sex workers of the street even though there were a huge number of arrest. Chapter five also looks at how the rights of the upper and the middle class take priority over the rights of the sex workers in the way that the middle and upper class feel threatened and uncomfortable with the prostitutes but the rights of the prostitutes are not taken into account. Chapter six looks at the report of the Committee on Sexual offences against children and Youth (The Badgley Report) and its recommendations. Its purpose was to \\"enquire into the incidence and prevalence in Canada of sexual offences against children and youth and to recommend improvements in laws for the protection of young persons from sexual abuse and exploitation\\"(Brock, 1998, p. 102). Chapter seven focuses on how the Badgley report built on a social problem of youth prostitution and victimization but it did not look at why the youth engaged in prostitution in the first place. The media and therefore the public saw youth prostitution as a new social problem but it has been happening for years. Chapter seven also looks at the legislation put in place to \\"protect\\" youth in prostitution and other resources that attempt to help youth prostitutes and/or runaways. Finally Chapter eight explains that criminalizing prostitution is not going to make it stop. Proving safe places for prostitution to take place would better serve everybody affected. Many prostitutes are murdered each year by their customers and many youth turn to survival sex, a form of prostitution. Women in the sex trade need more tools and support to protect themselves. The legislation and moral panic will not stop the sex trade despite what lawmakers may think. Brock, Deborah. 2000. \\"Victim, Nuisance, Fallen Woman, Outlaw, Worker?: Making the Identity, Prostitute in Canadian Criminal Law.\\" In D. Chunn and D. Lacombe (Ed.) Law as a Gendering Practice. Ontario.: Oxford University Press. In this chapter Deborah Brock looks at how some people see prostitution as women who are victimized by patriarchy, others see prostitution as women who will not be confined by the moral rules of sexuality. Other people see prostitutes as workers, some of which work is less favorable conditions than others but they are still workers. She examines how prostitution is often seen as symbolic of patriarchal oppression however many women use their bodies as a source of income. Sex workers are not able to participate in the discussions about the issues that directly affect them. They do not have a voice in the legislation being put forth to regulate their jobs and they do not have a say in the solutions that could decrease prostitution. She examines how laws have been in place to govern sex work since 1839 and is either seen as a public nuisance or a morality problem. The law continues to distinguish between good women and bad women and sex workers are often the scapegoat for other incidents or problems in the area.  Contributions to feminist criminology  Deborah Brock has contributed to feminist criminology through her work in understanding the root causes of prostitution and sex work. She contributes by explaining that prostitution, for the most part, is a choice made by the women as a way of supporting themselves. Sex work is sometimes the only option for women to support themselves because they are, many times, only given access to jobs that provide very low wages, are in the services sector and have little chance of advancement (Brock, 1998,p. 14-15). She notes that prostitution is seen as immoral however it is the oldest occupation in the world. She attempts to understand why prostitutes are labeled by their job rather than by who they really are. She tries to demystify why some women must turn to prostitution in order to support themselves. She also explains that the laws to stop prostitution do not work and mainly come from the moral panic that the media creates (Brock, 1998, p. 138). Her major contribution of feminist criminology is in how moral panics about prostitution create laws that do not work in fixing the problem.

It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on April 22, 2010, in celebration of Earth Day. The series follows the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob and Patrick protest the construction of a highway that would destroy Jellyfish Fields. The episode was written by Aaron Springer, Steven Banks, and Derek Iversen, and the animation was directed by Andrew Overtoom and Tom Yasumi. Upon release, the episode met positive reviews. On March 16, 2010, the episode became available on DVD. Plot summary Early one day, SpongeBob and Patrick become the first visitors to a new section of Jellyfish Fields. As they wander in the area, they discover a sign that states that a \\"super highway\\" will be built through Jellyfish Fields. Believing that the highway will pollute and ultimately destroy Jellyfish Fields(some jellyfish will die from moving or from a dirty environment or from the fact that this is a home destroyed), SpongeBob resolves to prevent the highway's creation. SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs for assistance, but he supports the highway, believing it can bring more customers to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob then shows Mr. Krabs the highway's blueprint, which shows that the highway with concrete columns will run over the Krusty Krab and end directly at the Chum Bucket, revealing that Plankton is responsible for the highway's development. Mr. Krabs thus decides to support SpongeBob. They both go to the Chum Bucket and ask Plankton to not develop the highway, but he states that, already, the whole rest of the town has unanimously voted to build the highway. Refusing to give up, SpongeBob and Patrick peacefully petition to stop the highway. Nobody listens to them, however, and they are quickly exiled for their actions. Shortly after arriving there, they see a parade meant to commemorate the groundbreaking of the highway. It is rapidly built and, as SpongeBob predicted, it turns Jellyfish Fields into a wasteland. A few days later, the Krusty Krab's business quickly dwindles due to the highway. Believing that no one will come to the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs decides to finally give Plankton the Krabby Patty formula. Mere seconds before he does, however, the jellyfish from Jellyfish Fields invade Bikini Bottom and start attacking civilians. Seeing this as an opportunity to demolish the highway, SpongeBob makes an appeal to the people, who agree to destroy it. Everybody in Bikini Bottom turns against Plankton and destroys the pavement and the columns of the highway (Plankton, who thinks his highway is unremovable, tries to save it but gets run over). Jellyfish Fields is restored instantly to its natural state. Production \\"SpongeBob's Last Stand\\" was written by Aaron Springer, Steven Banks, and Derek Iversen. Springer also served as storyboard director. Animation direction by Andrew Overtoom and Tom Yasumi, the episode was part of Nickelodeon's 2010 Earth Day celebration.

According to Nickelodeon, \\"[kids will] learn about the environment through different levels at different Bikini Bottom locales.\\" Nickelodeon officially announced the episode on a press release on April 5, 2010. According to the network, \\"SpongeBob and Patrick learn the 'Shelly Super Highway' is coming to Bikini Bottom - right through Jellyfish Fields! They must find a way to galvanize their neighbors, or it could be the end for Jellyfish Fields forever.\\" It was promoted as SpongeBob's campaign to save the jellyfish. Writer Banks told that the episode never set out to teach environmental lessons. He said \\"When you entertain someone and make it funny, sometimes you can get a message across [...] Not that we're out here to send messages everywhere.\\" The episode featured two musical numbers, including \\"Give Jellyfish Fields a Chance\\", a salute to the 1960s protest songs with similarities to John Lennon's \\"Give Peace a Chance\\".

Print Historical overview=Early manufacturing process During the late 19th and early 20th Century, the production of wooden roofing shingles was an extremely dangerous process in which the shingle weaver hand-fed pieces of raw wood onto an automated saw. Despite the danger of the profession, the industry was a large one throughout Washington and Oregon, and by 1893 Washington state alone had 150 mills which converted Western Red Cedar into shingles and shakes for the roofing and siding of American homes. The craft of shingle making demanded a high skill level and considerable manual dexterity.Harvey O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle: A Memoir. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964; pg. 30.

If the singing blade rips 50 rough > shingles off the block every minute, the sawyer must reach over to its teeth > 50 times in 60 seconds; if the automatic carriage feeds the odorous wood 60 > times into the hungry teeth, 60 times he must reach over, turn the shingle, > trim its edge on the gleaming saw in front of him, cut the narrow strip > containing the knot hole with two quick movements of his right hand, and > toss the completed board down the chute to the packers, meanwhile keeping > eyes and ears open for the sound that asks him to feed a new block into the > untiring teeth. Hour after hour the shingle weaver's hands and arms, plain, > unarmored flesh and blood, are staked against the screeching steel that > cares not what it severs. Hour after hour the steel sings its crescendo note > as it bites into the wood, the sawdust cloud thickens, the wet sponge under > the sawyer's nose fills with fine particles. > > \\"If 'cedar asthma,' the shingle weaver's occupational disease, does not get > him, the steel will. Sooner or later he reaches over a little too far, the > whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into the air, and a finger, a hand, > or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute.\\"Sunset magazine, > quoted in O'Connor, Revolution in Seattle, page 30. Unionization efforts The first attempt to unionize shingle weavers came in Michigan in 1886. This union lasted only a few years, due in large measure to the industry moving westward to the new state of Washington, which entered the United States as the 42nd state in November 1889.Philip C. Emerson, \\"The International Shingle Weavers of America: An Historical Essay, Seattle General Strike Project, University of Washington, 1999. In the Pacific Northwest, shingle weavers began to unionize as early as 1890, when the shingle weavers of the Puget Sound area of Western Washington banded together to establish the West Coast Shingle Weavers‚Äô Union. In short order, locals of the union were established in Ballard, Tacoma, Snohomish, Arlington, Chehalis, and Sedro- Wooley. This first foray into craft unionism proved to be short-lived, however, as an ill-timed strike crushed by an economic downturn in 1893 effectively put an end to the organizing effort. In 1901 a more successful attempt at unionization of the shingle makers' trade was made with the establishment of the International Shingle Weavers of America. In January 1903 a newspaper called The Shingle Weaver was established in Ballard as the official journal of the new union. The paper later moved to Everett, Washington and finally to Seattle during the course of its decade of publication before changing its name to The Timber Worker in February 1913.A few surviving copies of The Shingle Weaver (1903-1913) are available on microfilm from the University of Washington in Seattle and the University of Illinois in Urbana. For a bibliographic record, see http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90099723/holdings/ In 1915, a wage cut for shingle weavers in the mills of Everett, Washington began a process of events which led to a strike the following year by the radical union the Industrial Workers of the World and its suppression by force and violence. On November 5, 1916, events culminated in a pitched gun battle known to history as the \\"Everett massacre,\\" in which 5 strikers and 2 so-called \\"citizen deputies\\" were killed and approximately 45 others wounded.

It was originally titled \\"The Lost Sweetheart\\" and written during Jul‚ÄìAug 1898, but only published in late 1912.Howard G. Baetzhold, \\"Found: Mark Twain's \\"Lost Sweetheart\\",\\" American Literature, . The main character (believed to represent Twain) has several dreams throughout his life about the same woman.Dale W. Simpson, \\"Mark Twain and Artistic Inspiration in \\"My Platonic Sweetheart\\",\\" Mark Twain Journal, . The narrative depicts five of these dreams, and in each dream the main character and the woman take on different names. The woman's appearance (hair and eye color) also changes in each dream. However, the characters' ages in the dreams remain the same, he is seventeen and she is fifteen, and the two characters never fail to recognize each other. Summary In the first dream, the main character's name is George and the woman's name is Alice. The dream takes place in a Missourian village. Alice has blonde hair and blue eyes. George describes their affection as being like \\"a natural process.\\" They stroll along a country road after exiting a village, and enter an empty log house. Alice soon vanishes after passing through a door, and George follows suit only to find himself standing amidst a cemetery. The log house vanishes and darkness ensues. The main character abruptly awakens, realizes he's in Philadelphia and is actually nineteen years old. In the second dream, the main character's name is Jack and the woman's name is Helen. Jack meets Helen in a forest near Mississippi. Helen has black hair and dark brown eyes. Jack carries Helen over a shallow stream and continues to carry her for miles on end, because he is \\"without some sense of fatigue or need of rest.\\" They arrive at a plantation house, Helen's home, and Jack meets Helen's parents. Helen falls asleep and everything becomes pitch black. Then, Jack finds himself standing on a frozen lake. The main character wakes up in grief and is sitting at his workplace, a newspaper office in San Francisco. He is twenty nine years old and has been asleep for less than two minutes. In the third dream, the main character's name is Robert and the woman's name is Agnes. The dream takes place in San Francisco and in Iao Valley in the Hawaiian Islands. The main character describes how a \\"dream-language\\" exists that \\"shaves meanings finer and closer than do the world's daytime dictionaries.\\" For example, \\"'Rax oha tal'\\" translates to \\"'When you receive this it will remind you that I long to see your face and touch your hand, for the comfort of it and the peace.'\\" Agnes passes away in Robert's arms as she is hit by an arrow. The dream ends and the main character is crossing Bond Street in New York with a friend as snow is falling. In the fourth dream, the main character refers to the woman as Agnes again, but he is unnamed. They chat in a large house in Athens as Socrates passes by. Suddenly, the main character awakens and finds himself in his New York home. In the fifth dream, the main character and the woman are unnamed. The dream takes place in India and Windsor Castle, England. By the end of their conversation they conclude that \\"England is the most beautiful of all the countries...because it is so marginal.\\" Once again, the woman disappears. The main character wakes up from his dream and is going on sixty three years old. The main character concludes that dreams are \\"deep and strong and sharp and real\\" while reality is a \\"vague and dull-tinted artificial world.\\" Reception Dale W. Simpson from Missouri Southern State College suggests that the main character represents Mark Twain, as he says this work \\"may be interpreted as an important self-portrait of the artist,\\" by evidence of Twain's notebook and autobiography. In addition, Simpson asserts that the woman in the narrative does not refer to Laura M. Wright (who allegedly had a brief love affair with Twain), but that the female character is a symbol of innocence, which serves as the \\"artistic inspiration\\" that is \\"representative of his art.\\" It is said that Twain's \\"concern with the fading of his creative powers must have stirred him to write [this narrative].\\" On the contrary, Howard G. Baetzhold of Butler University examines the relationship between Wright and Twain and argues that the woman in the narrative refers to Laura M. Wright, and that she is a source of inspiration for some of Twain's works. Ron Powers of Smithsonian Magazine agrees with Baetzhold saying, \\"scholar Howard Baetzhold has pieced together overwhelming evidence that the figure in the dream is Laura.\\"Ron Powers, \\"Mark Twain in Love,\\" Smithsonian Magazine, accessed November 13, 2014, http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/mark- twain-in-love-14530235/?no-ist.

Retrieved April 2010 United Kingdom from its foundation in 1909 until 2008, when it closed as middle school functions in the town were transferred to Cramlington Learning Village. History= Construction  The original building was constructed in 1909Cramlington's Green Heritage, Cramilington History Society. Retrieved 2010 for the sum of ¬£10,000, which was considered a significant price at the time. The former stone school, which had been used since 1853, became a parish hall. It was officially opened on 13 September 1909 by Sir Francis Blake, 1st Baronet, of Tillmouth Park, who was then the Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland. According to the Wansbeck Telegraph, \\"Several hundred people assembled at Cramlington village to witness the opening...there was a rendering of Ye Mariners of England by the children... and a photographic view of the group [was] taken.\\" Parkside in the snow in early 2010. It was certified as a secondary modern school, and thus children who did not make the grading requirement on the 11-Plus went there.  First World War  On 17 November 1914, the school was occupied by the British Army for use during the First World War, and thus a half-timetable was put in place. No lights were allowed in the school due to the threat of Zeppelin raids, one of which occurred on 2 April 1916 over Cramlington.  Between the Wars  During the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918, teaching staff were reduced to one member of staff and average attendance to 55% due to the outbreak. One pupil died in early 1919 from the disease. The first few years did not go well, with a focus on inspections which recorded an outbreak of scarlet fever in November 1915. The following month, the temperature was recorded at inside the school. The Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII visited the school in 1921. During the 1926 general strike, it was noted by an inspector that many children had inadequate footwear due to the poverty caused by their parents suffering ten days away from work. During the Second World War, the teaching staff was reduced to only two male teachers due to conscription. In the first week of September 1939, part of the school was taken over as a military hospital and air raid shelters were built on the school fields.  After World War Two  Following the Education Act 1944, the school reopened fully on 9 April 1945 as Cramlington Modern School. In 1977, it was considered significant to record in the logs that the school was renting a video recorder for the first time.  Closure  The school was closed on 21 July 2008 and its pupils transferred to Cramlington Learning Village, ending a 99-year history of education at the same site. The schools records were forwarded to the National Archives for safe keeping.Northumberland Collections Service: 2008 Accessions ‚Äì Parkside Middle School, Records. Retrieved April 2010  Buildings and site  The school was located on a site to the north of the Village Road, behind the Blagdon Arms and Primitive Methodist Chapel. In addition to the original two- floor building, the Main Hall, gymnasium, and a number of other classrooms were later added to the west and south of the main block, enclosing a paved area known as the quadrangle. Covered walkways between the newer buildings and the original block were later enclosed with outer walls to protect the children from the weather. In the early 1990s, a Year 5 block was constructed to the far west of the site, replacing huts that had stood on the playing fields for the previous few decades. Playing fields and a tennis court with wire net fence around the perimeter occupied the land between the school buildings and the B1326 Northumbrian Road. The school's main playing field was located to the east of the main site, across the cycle track. Air raid shelters once occupied the side of the field nearest the cycle track. The caretaker's house stood immediately to the north of the Blagdon Arms pub. The buildings were demolished during the Summer of 2014, in preparation for the redevelopment of the site into a housing estate of 34 homes by builder Taylor Wimpey between 2014 and 2016.

It is located in the parish of Church Stretton, 2¬Ω miles southwest of the market town of Church Stretton. A historic settlement, it is situated on a foothill of the Long Mynd at around 240m above sea level. As of 2010, there are around 12 dwellings in the hamlet. Three lanes lead out from the hamlet: one to the A49 road, one mile southeast at Marshbrook; another lane leads to the hamlet of Hamperley, which is also in Church Stretton parish; and Little Stretton is one mile to the northeast. History and features The place name is from Welsh mynydd meaning 'hill' and Old English tun meaning 'settlement', 'town'. The hamlet has largely retained its Anglo-Saxon layout, with a patchwork of plots and haphazard narrow lanes. There are remains of a motte, which dates from either Anglo- Saxon or Norman times. It was a township and Royal manor,British History Online Church Stretton held by King Edward prior to the Norman conquest. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book.Raven, Michael, 2005, A Guide to Shropshire (third edition), page 133 Today the hamlet consists of farms and cottages and is agricultural in character. It is designated a conservation areaShropshire Council Minton Conservation Area: map and there are 5 Listed buildings in the hamlet ‚Äì Long Mynd House, Ivanhoe, Manor Farmhouse, Well Cottage, and Minton House.British Listed Buildings Church Stretton parish: map There is an outdoors activity centre located on the lane between Minton and Hamperley, the Longmynd Adventure Camp, with overnight accommodation and camping ground.Longmynd Adventure Camp Minton Hill and Batch Minton Hill is to the northwest of the hamlet and rises to 453m. A bridleway leads up to its summit (and continues beyond onto the Long Mynd) from the hamlet of Minton. Another walking route up to the Long Mynd is via the Minton Batch, where a bridleway leads up from the lane to Hamperley.Geograph Minton Batch Famous residents The Oscar-nominated actor, Pete Postlethwaite, lived at Yew Tree Cottage in Minton for many years before moving to the village of More near Bishop's Castle. \\"I do love Shropshire,\\" he was quoted as saying. \\"Whenever I get home, my shoulders drop by two inches. The only reason I‚Äôve been able to do the things I‚Äôve done is because I have my family and Shropshire to come home to. They‚Äôve made everything else possible.\\" The Minton surname The Shropshire surname of Minton originates from the name of the hamlet although resources seem to disagree as to its earliest occurrence. Some point to Jordan de Minton, who was mentioned in the Pipe Rolls of Northumberland in 1169. However, the Rev R W Eyton in his book, 'The Antiquities of Shropshire' identifies Walter de Miniton (later Walter de Muneton) as the first tenant of Minton or Muneton as the site was then known. Subsequent Mintons of note include Thomas Minton (English potter), John Minton (British artist), Yvonne Minton (Australian opera singer), Mary Minton (novelist) and Sherman Minton (US Democratic senator). Popular culture Film: The titular character of the movie, 'Big Stan' starring Rob Schneider was named Stan Minton.Big Stan The characters of Conrad and Wilma Minton (played by Lew Ayres and Herta Ware) also appeared in the episode, 'Old Flames' in 1980s crime drama, 'Cagney and Lacey'. Literature: A series of children's books called, 'Minton Goes...' has been written by Anna Fienberg and Kim Gamble. A character called Sophia Minton also appeared in Agatha Christie's book, 'N or M?'. The fictional airfield of RAF Minton featured in 'The Shepherd' by Frederick ForsythThe Shepherd while the village of Little Minton was invented by Enid Blyton for her book, 'The Mystery of the Secret Room'. The fictional town of Minton, New England also provided the setting for the 1860 novel, 'The Ebony Idol' by G M Flanders.The Ebony Idol See also *Listed buildings in Church Stretton References Category:Church Stretton Category:Villages in Shropshire ","title":"Minton, Shropshire"},{"id":"26905723","text":"\\"Concerning the Jews\\" is an 1899 short essay by Mark Twain. Twain had lived in Austria during 1896, and opined that the Habsburg empire used Jews as scapegoats to maintain unity in their immensely diverse empire. In 1898 he published the article \\"Stirring Times in Austria\\". Twain's account generated several letters, and one poignant response in particular from an American Jewish lawyer who asked Twain: \\"Tell me, therefore, from your vantage-point of cold view, what in your mind is the cause. Can American Jews do anything to correct it either in America or abroad? Will it ever come to an end? Will a Jew be permitted to live honestly, decently, and peaceably like the rest of mankind? What has become of the golden rule?\\"page 2 of the facsimile of the 1934 reprint In response, Twain penned \\"Concerning the Jews,\\" which Harper‚Äôs also published in 1899. The essay included the statement that Jews did not do their part in terms of fighting in America's armed forces: \\"He is a frequent and faithful and capable officer in the civil service, but he is charged with an unpatriotic disinclination to stand by the flag as a soldier ‚Äì like the Christian Quaker.\\" However, when War Department figures revealed that Jewish Americans were actually represented in the nation's military in a larger percentage than their share of the population, Twain issued a retraction and an apology,Tom Tugend, \\"Little known museum tells story of Jews in the American military,\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), March 17, 2008., from Internet Archive entitled Postscript ‚Äì The Jew as Soldier.

It was interpreted by Romans as a sign of the deification of recently assassinated dictator, Julius Caesar (100‚Äì44 BC).Grant, Michael (1970), The Roman Forum, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson; Photos by Werner Forman, p. 94. It was perhaps the most famous comet of antiquity. Based on two sketchy reports from China (May 30) and Rome (July 23), an infinite number of orbit determinations can fit the observations, but a retrograde orbit is inferred based on available notes.The Comet of 44 B.C. and Caesar's Funeral Games (John T. Ramsey, A. Lewis Licht) pg 125 The comet approached Earth both inbound in mid-May and outbound in early August.Cometography Vol 1 pg 22 by Gary W. Kronk It came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on May 25, ‚àí43 at a solar distance of about . At perihelion the comet had a solar elongation of 11 degrees and is hypothesized to have had an apparent magnitude of around ‚àí3 as the Chinese report is not consistent with daytime visibility during May.See Ramsey pg 122-123: (Comet absolute magnitude H1 of 3.3) + 2.5 * (n of 4) * log (Sun distance of 0.220 AU) + 5 * log (Earth distance of 1.09 AU) = perihelion apparent magnitude of ‚àí3.1. Between June 10 and July 20 the comet would have dimmed from magnitude +1 to around magnitude +5. Around July 20, ‚àí43, the comet underwent an estimated 9 magnitude outburst in apparent magnitudeThe Comet of 44 B.C. and Caesar's Funeral Games (John T. Ramsey, A. Lewis Licht) pg 123 and had a solar elongation of 88 degrees in the morning sky. At magnitude ‚àí4 it would have been as impressive as Venus. As a result of the cometary outburst in late July, Caesar's Comet is one of only five comets known to have had a negative absolute magnitude (for a comet, this refers to the apparent magnitude if the comet had been observed at a distance of 1 AU from both the Earth and the Sun) and may have been the brightest daylight comet in recorded history.Flare-up on July 23‚Äì25, 44 BC (Rome): ‚àí4.0 (Richter model) and ‚àí9.0 (41P/Tuttle-Giacobini- Kres√°k model); absolute magnitude on May 26, 44 BC (China): ‚àí3.3 (Richter) and ‚àí4.4 (41P/TGK); calculated in Ramsey and Licht, Op. cit., p. 236. In the absence of accurate contemporary observations (or later observations confirming an orbit that predicts the earlier appearance), calculation of the comet's orbit is problematic and a parabolic orbit is conventionally assumed. (In the 1800s a possible match was speculated which would give it a period of about 575 years. This has not been confirmed because the later observations are similarly insufficiently accurate.) The parabolic orbital solution estimates that the comet would now be more than from the Sun. At that distance, the Sun provides less light than the full Moon provides to Earth. History Caesar's Comet was known to ancient writers as the Sidus Iulium (\\"Julian Star\\") or Caesaris astrum (\\"Star of Julius CaesarCaesar\\"). The bright, daylight-visible comet appeared suddenly during the festival known as the Ludi Victoriae Caesaris ‚Äì for which the 44 BC iteration was long considered to have been held in the month of September (a conclusion drawn by Edmund Halley). The dating has recently been revised to a July occurrence in the same year, some four months after the assassination of Julius Caesar, as well as Caesar's own birth month. According to Suetonius, as celebrations were getting underway, \\"a comet shone for seven successive days, rising about the eleventh hour, and was believed to be the soul of Caesar.\\"Suetonius, Divus Julius; 88 The Twelve Caesars The Comet became a powerful symbol in the political propaganda that launched the career of Caesar's great-nephew (and adoptive son) Augustus. The Temple of Divus Iulius (Temple of the Deified Julius) was built (42 BC) and dedicated (29 BC) by Augustus for purposes of fostering a \\"cult of the comet\\". (It was also known as the \\"Temple of the Comet Star\\".Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, 2.93‚Äì94.) At the back of the temple a huge image of Caesar was erected and, according to Ovid, a flaming comet was affixed to its forehead: > To make that soul a star that burns forever > Above the Forum and the gates of Rome.Ovid, Metamorphoses; XV, 840. On Roman coinage Coin minted by Augustus (c. 19‚Äì18 BC); Obverse: CAESAR AVGVSTVS, laureate head right/Reverse: DIVVS IVLIV[S], with comet (star) of eight rays, tail upward. Tracing the coinage from 44 BC through the developing rule of Augustus reveals the changing relationship of Julius Caesar to the Sidus Iulium. Robert Gurval notes that the shifting status of Caesar's comet in the coinage follows a definite pattern. Representations of the deified Julius Caesar as a star appeared relatively quickly, occurring within several years of his death. About twenty years passed, however, before the star completed its transformation into a comet. Starting in 44 BC, a money maker named P. Sepullius Macer created coins with the front displaying Julius Caesar crowned with a wreath and a star behind his head. On the back, Venus, the patron goddess of the Julian family, holds a starred scepter. Gurval maintains that this coin was minted about the time of Caesar's assassination and thus probably would not have originally referred to his deification. As it circulated, however, it would have brought that idea to mind because of Caesar's new cult. Kenneth Scott's older work The Sidus Iulium and the Apotheosis of Caesar contests this by assuming that the comet did indeed spark this series because of similarity to other coins he produced. A series of Roman aurei and denarii minted after this cult began show Mark Antony and a star, which most likely represents his position as Caesar's priest. In later coins likely originating near the end of Octavian's war with Sextus Pompey, the star supplants Caesar's name and face entirely, clearly representing his divinity. One of the clearest and earliest correlations of Caesar to a comet occurred during the Secular Games of 17 BC when money maker M. Sanquinius fashioned coins whose reverse sports a comet over the head of a wreathed man whom classicists and numismatists speculate is either a youthful Caesar, the Genius of the Secular Games, the Julian family, or Aeneas‚Äô son Iulus. These coins strengthened the link between Julius Caesar and Augustus since Augustus associated himself with the Julians. Another set of Spanish coins displays an eight-rayed comet with the words DIVVS IVLIVS, meaning Divine Julius. In literature The poet Virgil writes in his ninth eclogue that the star of Caesar has appeared to gladden the fields. Virgil later writes of the period following Julius Caesar‚Äôs assassination, \\"Never did fearsome comets so often blaze.\\"Georgic 1.487‚Äì488 qtd. In Ramsey and Licht, Op. cit Gurval points out that this passage in no way links a comet to Caesar's divine status, but rather links comets to his death. It is Ovid, however, who makes the final assertion of the comet's role in Julius Caesar's deification. Ovid describes the deification of Caesar in Metamorphoses (8 AD): > Then Jupiter, the Father, spoke...\\"Take up Caesar‚Äôs spirit from his murdered > corpse, and change it into a star, so that the deified Julius may always > look down from his high temple on our Capitol and forum.\\" He had barely > finished, when gentle Venus stood in the midst of the Senate, seen by no > one, and took up the newly freed spirit of her Caesar from his body, and > preventing it from vanishing into the air, carried it towards the glorious > stars. As she carried it, she felt it glow and take fire, and loosed it from > her breast: it climbed higher than the moon, and drawing behind it a fiery > tail, shone as a star.Ovid, Metamorphoses; XV; 745‚Äì842. It has been argued recently that the idea of Augustus's use of the comet for his political aims largely stems from this passage. In Shakespeare‚Äôs Julius Caesar (1599), Caesar's wife remarks on the fateful morning of her husband's murder: \\"When beggars die there are no comets seen. The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\\" Modern scholarship In 1997, two scholars at the University of Illinois at Chicago ‚Äì John T. Ramsey (a classicist) and A. Lewis Licht (a physicist) ‚Äì published a bookRamsey and Licht, Op. cit. comparing astronomical/astrological evidence from both Han China and Rome. Their analysis, based on historical eyewitness accounts, Chinese astronomical records, astrological literature from later antiquity and ice cores from Greenland glaciers, yielded a range of orbital parameters for the hypothetical object. They settled on a perihelion point of 0.22 AU for the object which was apparently visible with a tail from the Chinese capital Chang'an (in late May) and as a star-like object from Rome (in late July): * May 18, 44 BC (China) * July 23‚Äì25, 44 BC (Rome) * Apparent magnitude: ‚àí4.0The Comet of 44 B.C. and Caesar's Funeral Games (John T. Ramsey, A. Lewis Licht) pg 121 A few scholars, such as Robert Gurval of UCLA and Brian G. Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, leave the comet's very existence as an open question. Marsden notes in his foreword to Ramsey and Licht's book, \\"Given the circumstance of a single reporter two decades after the event, I should be remiss if I were not to consider this [i.e., the comet's non-existence] as a serious possibility.\\"Marsden, Brian G., \\"Forward\\"; In: Ramsey and Licht, Op. cit.

He lived and worked at the transition time between 3rd and 4th Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period.Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson, London 2004, , p. 52 & 61.  Identity = Family  Netjeraperef was most possibly a son of king (pharaoh) Snefru. However, this suggestion is disputed, because the elite title \\"son of the king\\" was often merely an honorary title during the Old Kingdom, given to rightful officials of extraordinary ranks. \\"Real\\" princes bore the title \\"bodily son of the king\\".  Titles  As a high-ranking official and priest, Netjeraperef held many bureaucratic and priestly titles: * Son of the King (Egyptian: Sa-nesw). * Overseer of the phyles of Lower Egypt (Egyptian: Imy-ra-zau-Shemaw). * Overseer of the commissioners (Egyptian: Imy-ra-wpwt). * Chief of the nomes (Egyptian: Heqa-sepawt). * God's servant of the pyramid Snefru, the blessed, appears (Egyptian: Hem-netjer-Kha-khenty-Snefru).  Career  It is noteworthy to mention, that the first three titles Imy-ra- shemaw, Imy-ra-wpwt and Heqa-sepawt are common titles for officials of Lower Egypt. Thus, Netjeraperef held office in northern territories.Juan Carlos Moreno Garc√≠a: Ancient Egyptian Administration (= Handbook of Oriental Studies-series). BRILL, Leiden 2013, , p. 145 & 170. Possible contemporary office partners of Netjeraperef may have been Khabawsokar, Metjen, Pehernefer and Akhetaa. These are likewise known for their unusually richly decorated tomb chapels and for their accurately reported careers. However, it is not proven that these officials were related to each other in any way.Peter J√°nosi: Die Gr√§berwelt der Pyramidenzeit (= Zaberns Bildb√§nde zur Arch√§ologie- series). von Zabern, Mainz 2006, , p. 45-47.William Stevenson Smith, William Kelly Simpson: The art and architecture of ancient Egypt (= The Pelican history of art, vol. 14), 2nd edition. Penguin Books, New York 1981, , p. 63‚Äì67.  Tomb  Netjeraperef was buried in mastaba I/1 at Dahshur, which was excavated by the German Archaeological Institut, Cairo.Nicole Alexanian: Dahschur. Bd. II: Das Grab des Prinzen Netjer-aperef: die Mastaba II/1 in Dahschur (= Arch√§ologische Ver√∂ffentlichungen, Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut, Abteilung Kairo. Bd. 56). von Zabern, Mainz 1999, . The tomb was made of mudbricks and measured once around 35.10m x 18.90m. The inner structure comprised a stairway with a few steps leading into a straight corridor. The corridor in turn led into a hallway stretching left and right, forming a T-shaped chamber arrangement. It is noteworthy to mention that the terrain of Dahshur provided a rather soft and loose ground, a circumstance that forbade any deeper underground chamber building and thus forced the tomb builders to create chambers inside the mastaba and over ground level. A similar case happened during the construction of the Bent Pyramid, when the walls and ceilings of chambers under ground level started to form cracks. At the central chamber of Netjeraperef's tomb, an altar was placed in an offering chapel. A special feature of Netjeraperef's offering chapel are the two stelae (once set each left and right of the altar), of which one is nearly completely preserved. This arrangement was a clear copy of Sneferu's stele sanctuaries at his pyramids at Meidum and Dahshur. The stelae both once bore the names and titles of Netjeraperef. One of the stelae, however, was stolen during restoration work in Middle Kingdom period and re-used as a door frame for Sneferu's valley temple at Meidum.Miroslav Verner: The Pyramids: The Mystery, Culture, and Science of Egypt's Great Monuments.

On five specified days of the Aztec calendar they descended to earth and haunted crossroads, hoping to steal children whom they had not been able to have themselves. The Cantares Mexicanos is an important collection of lyric poetry transcribed from N√°huatl into Roman letters around 1550 CE, about 30 years after the fall of Tenochtitlan. In his 1985 edition of these poems, John Bierhorst interprets the poems as \\"ghost songs\\" that were intended to summon the spirits of dead Aztec warriors back to earth to help their descendants under Spanish rule. If the songs were successful the ghosts would descend from heaven fully armed and ready to fight, demanding payment in human sacrifice. This interpretation is, however, controversial. Maya beliefs The traditional Maya live in the continual presence of the \\"(grand)fathers and (grand)mothers\\", the usually anonymous, bilateral ancestors, who, in the highlands, are often conceived of as inhabiting specific mountains, where they expect the offerings of their descendants. In the past, too, the ancestors had an important role to play, with the difference that, among the nobility, genealogical memory and patrilineal descent were much more emphasized. Thus, the Popol Vuh lists three genealogies of upper lords descended from three ancestors and their wives. These first male ancestors - ritually defined as \\"bloodletters and sacrificers\\" - had received their private deities in a legendary land of origins called \\"The Seven Caves and Seven Canyons\\" (Nahua Chicomoztoc), and on their disappearance, left a sacred bundle. In Chiapas, at the time of the Spanish conquest, lineage ancestors were believed to have emerged from the roots of a ceiba tree. Comparable beliefs still exist amongst the Tz'utujiles.Robert S. Carlson, and Martin Prechtel, 'The Flowering of the Dead: An Interpretation of Highland Maya Culture'. Man 26-1 (1991): 22-42. Day of the Dead Day of the Dead at a Mexican cemetery. The Day of the Dead (), is a holiday celebrated in Mexico and by Latin Americans living in the United States and Canada. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died. The celebration occurs on November 2 in connection with the Catholic holidays of All Saints' Day (November 1) and All Souls' Day (November 2). Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars honoring the deceased using sugar skulls, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts. Due to occurring shortly after Halloween, the Day of the Dead is sometimes thought to be a similar holiday, although the two actually have little in common. The Day of the Dead is a time of celebration, where partying is common. The Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico can be traced back to the indigenous cultures. Rituals celebrating the deaths of ancestors have been observed by these civilizations perhaps for as long as 2500‚Äì3000 years. The festival that became the modern Day of the Dead fell in the ninth month of the Aztec calendar, about the beginning of August, and was celebrated for an entire month. The festivities were dedicated to the god. known as the \\"Lady of the Dead,\\" corresponding to the modern Catrina. People go to cemeteries to communicate with the souls of the departed who are paying a holiday visit home. The descendants build private altars, containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so that the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. In most regions of Mexico, November 1 honors children and infants, whereas deceased adults are honored on November 2. This is indicated by generally referring to November 1 mainly as \\"D√≠a de los Inocentes\\" (Day of the Innocents) but also as \\"D√≠a de los Angelitos\\" (Day of the Little Angels) and November 2 as \\"D√≠a de los Muertos\\" or \\"D√≠a de los Difuntos\\" (Day of the Dead). Modern ghost legends=La Llorona From a film La Llorona. \\"La Llorona\\" is Spanish for \\"The Crying Woman\\" and is a popular legend in Spanish-speaking cultures in the colonies of the Americas, with many versions extant. The basic story is that La Llorona was a beautiful woman who killed her children to be with the man that she loved and was subsequently rejected by him. He might have been the children's father who had left their mother for another woman, or he might have been a man she loved but who was uninterested in a relationship with a woman with children, and whom she thought she could win if the children were out of the way. She drowned the children and then, after being rejected anyway, killed herself. She is doomed to wander, vainly searching for her children for all eternity. Her constant weeping is the reason for her name. In some cases, according to the tale, she will kidnap wandering children or children who misbehave. La Planchada \\"La Planchada\\" is Spanish for \\"the ironed lady\\". Contrary to what people may assume because of the legend's title, La Planchada was not a woman who was crushed, rather it is similar to La Llorona. Legend says it was a nurse who was attracted to a doctor and he rejected her, or a disgruntled nurse, or a nurse who killed her patient. Many variations of how she was created exist, but one consistent theme is that her ghost appears in many hospitals, though mainly in the metropolitan areas, especially in Mexico City. Many hospitals such as Hospital Ju√°rez claim she appears there in her old 1930s/60s nurse uniform, which is perfectly ironed (hence the name \\"La Planchada\\") and heals patients in the emergency sections. Just as there are claims about how she was turned into a ghost, there are many others in which eyewitnesses claim she appears. Some say she emits a sort of glow. Others say she looks like a normal nurse. Others say she floats, while others say she walks normally, but her steps are never heard. This happens at night and the next morning patients feel better and are taken to another room for further recovery. When asked why they feel better, patients say that \\"a nurse came in and healed me\\", but no one in the hospital was either guarding the room or no nurse came at the time the incident happened. Vanishing hitchhiker In the Mexican version of the Vanishing hitchhiker urban legend, the hitchhiker is a beautiful woman, who chats with a stranger in a taxi. When she leaves as a normal person she leaves her address. When the person tries to reach the woman at her home, he is informed the woman is dead and that it is also the anniversary of her death. Cemetery hauntings Often there are ghost legends associated with the older cemeteries. For example, the Pante√≥n de Bel√©n (also Santa Paula Cemetery), a historical cemetery located in Guadalajara, Mexico, is the site of legends and night tours. The cemetery was opened in 1848 and it was formally closed in 1896. Legends that are part of the local folklore include the Vampire, The Pirate, The Lovers, The Monk, The Child afraid of the Dark, The Story of Jos√© Cuervo, The Nun and many more. In the arts Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories is a book of short stories published in 1991 by San Antonio-based Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros. The title story is a modern version of the legend of La Llorona. Hasta el viento tiene miedo (Even the Wind has Fear or Even the Wind is Scared) is a 1968 Mexican horror film, written and directed by Carlos Enrique Taboada. The film is about a ghost that seeks revenge in a school for girls. A remake was released for the Halloween season of 2007 with Martha Higareda as the protagonist. Kilometer 31 (Kil√≥metro 31 or km 31) is a 2007 Mexican horror film, written and directed by Rigoberto Casta√±eda.EyeForFilm.co.uk interview with director Rigoberto Casta√±eda about KM31 and Blackout.

A 2009 profile of Cauchetier in Aperture magazine declared that his photographs \\"are themselves central works of the New Wave.\\" Self-taught, Cauchetier began taking pictures while serving in the press corps of the French Air Force in Indochina; his unit did not have the budget for a photographer and he bought his own Rolleiflex camera. He remained in the region after his service ended, taking pictures of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. In 1957, he met director Marcel Camus, who was in Cambodia to shoot the film Mort en fraude (Fugitive in Saigon), and was hired as the set photographer. Upon Cauchetier's return to France, he failed to find work as a photojournalist, and was instead hired to take pictures for photo-romans, a kind of photographic graphic novel, by publisher Hubert Serra. Through Serra, Cauchetier became acquainted with Jean-Luc Godard, then working as a film critic and hoping to become a filmmaker himself. Godard hired Cauchetier as the set photographer for his debut film, √Ä bout de souffle (1960), a breakthrough both for Godard and for French cinema.

Biographer Carl Strikwerda, states: :Louise Tilly has been one of the leaders in the growth of scholarship on women's history, the history of the family, and social history in the late 20th century, helping to create an interdisciplinary approach to the study of social change that combines anthropology, sociology, economics, and demography with traditional archival and historical research. Her central contributions have been in demonstrating the historical importance of women's labor, showing the crucial effects of demographic change on the work of women and children, and documenting the interrelations between economic developments and family life. Beyond these concerns, she has also contributed to the study of food riots, collective action, social movements, and social welfare.Carl Strikwerda, \\"Tilly, Louise A.\\" in Education At a young age, Tilly was influenced to study history by a fourth grade teacher. She acquired a bachelor's degree in history from Rutgers University (with honors) in 1952, followed by a master's degree from Boston University in 1955, and a Ph.D. at the University of Toronto in 1974. Career An author, editor, contributing author, and editor of nine books and fifty scholarly articles, Louise A. Tilly examined the history from \\"ordinary people\\" and how they effect holistic social change. For example, in Tilly's last book Politics and Class in Milan, 1881‚Äì1901, she examined the duality of the working class and the rise of the socialist movement in Milan, Italy. Additionally, Tilly's research looked to find how industrialization, the formation of class, and welfare states effected gender and family structures throughout the world. Louise A. Tilly, a recipient of notable grants such as the Rockefeller Foundation Population Policy, was also an evaluator of grants and fellowships for the National Science Foundation. Tilly taught as a professor at Michigan State University and the University of Michigan throughout the 1970s and 1980s. While at the University of Michigan, Tilly served as the director of the women's studies department during the same time period. Additionally, Tilly served as president of the American Historical Association in 1993. She later occupied the Michael E. Gellert Professor of History and Sociology, at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, where she was also the chair on the Committee on Historical Studies. Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the \\"family wage economy\\" of early industrialization, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the \\"family consumer economy,\\" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, Women, work, and family (1987). Family Louise Tilly's spouse was author and Professor Charles Tilly (1929‚Äì2008). Together they contributed ample research toward historical and sociological scholarship. The couple had four children: Christopher, Kit, Laura, and Sarah. Her brother-in-law was the economic historian Richard H. Tilly. Bibliography * * * Charles Tilly / Louise Tilly / Richard H.

Based in La Rochelle, Amel is known for its production of ocean-going sailboats. History Yacht designer Henri Amel founded Chantiers Amel in 1965. During World War II, Amel noticed that the floating caissons used by invading Allied naval forces in France relied on polyester resin construction, which he would ultimately adopt in the production of his boats. Amel's first boat, the Super Mistral 23, was built in Marseille after he took over a failing shipyard. The boat itself was a success, but the business failed. In 1963, Amel began building boats in the shipyard of another builder at La Rochelle. He split off on his own, founding Chantiers Amel in 1965. A fire burned his new shipyard to the ground in 1967, but it was rebuilt and a success by 1973. Amel was blind for an extended period of his career. At the time of his death in 2005, Amel donated 12,000 of his 13,000 shares in Chantier Amel to the company's employees. Boats The shipyard produces blue-water cruising fiberglass ketches which included a popular 16 metre series branded Meltem, Mango, Super Maramu, and Amel 54, as well as smaller sloop and ketch series branded Kirk, Fango, Euros, Sharki, and Maramu. All discontinued series were designed by Henri Amel. For many years, Chantiers Amel was known for its practice of only producing a single model at a time. Since around 2010, the company has been producing the Amel 64 flagship and the Amel 55. The design for both boats was done by Jean Berret & Olivier Racoupeau.http://www.lexpress.fr/tendances/salon-nautique-la-carte-de-l- elegance-a-la-francaise_1305302.htmlhttp://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/videos/new- amel-55-review-test/ ReferencesExternal links * *Chantiers Amel (archive) * Category:French boat builders ","title":"Amel Yachts"},{"id":"26906274","text":"Natio Hungarica (Latin for \\"Hungarian nation\\") may refer to: *The Latin phrase ' (\\"Hungarian Nation\\") was a medieval and early modern era geographic, institutional and juridico-political category in Kingdom of Hungary without any ethnic connotation.http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/transy/transy05.htm The medieval \\"Natio Hungarica\\" consisted only the members of the Hungarian Parliament, which was composed of the nobility, Roman Catholic clergy, and a limited number of enfranchised burghers (regardless of their real ethnicity and mother tongue). The same term was extended later to denominate the whole elite with the corporate political rights of parliamentary representation in the early modern period ‚Äî the Roman Catholic prelates, all magnates, and all nobles. The other important - and more numerous - component of Natio Hungarica was the noble members of the county assemblies in the county seats, Kingdom of Hungary had 72 counties. The noble assemblies of the counties elected most of the envoys (members) of the parliament. Those who had no direct participation in the political life on national [parliamentary] or local [counties] level (like the common people of the cities, towns, or the peasantry of the villages) were not considered part of the Natio Hungarica. This medieval convention was also adopted officially in the Treaty of Szatm√°r of 1711 and the Pragmatic Sanction of 1723; remained until 1848, when the privileges of the Hungarian nobility was abolished; and thereafter acquired a sense of ethnic nationalism.John M.

It was also issued as a follow up single to \\"Pay the Devil\\" in the U.S. and was expected to be \\"chart bound\\" on the Hot 100, but it did not chart. The band broke up a few months after its release, with their label dropping them due to failed expectations. They remained disbanded until a 1986 reunion. Overview and reviews Round Trip was their third album, and it was produced by Jack Douglas. The album was generally critically panned at the time of its release, however, some critics have subsequently been more positive. Steve \\"Spaz\\" Schnee of Allmusic called it \\"brilliant\\" and stated that it was better than the previous two albums. Darren Robbins of the pop culture review website The Zeitgeisty Report has called the album a \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"possibly the most underrated album of all-time\\". Critic David Fricke of Rolling Stone gave a generally positive review, commenting: The New York Times was less generous. The Times, while calling the album \\"well-crafted\\" said that \\"with its careful harmonies, psychedelic sound effects and jazzy touches, [the album] tries to conceal the utter fatuity of its songs under studio cosmetics,\\" and took the album as proof that The Knack was a \\"one-hit wonder.\\" The song \\"Boys Go Crazy\\" was included in the 1992 EMI Music compilation album My Sharona.

According to Tomas O Flannghaile it was \\"the first journal devoted to the living Irish language\\". It has been described by the historian Donnchadh √ì Corr√°in as \\"the first important bilingual Irish periodical\\". An early manifestation of the Gaelic revival, it was established with the help of Douglas Hyde, and first published in 1882, by the Gaelic Union, and from 1893 by Conradh na Gaeilge. After some initial irregularities, the journal was published monthly until 1909. From 1894 the frontcover got a new logo, where the Irish name of the publication features more dominantly. Its first editor was David Comyn, followed by John Fleming, Eoghan O'Growney and from November 1894 Eoin MacNeill. MacNeill was succeeded by Seosamh Laoide in 1899. From 1902 to 1909 the editor was Tadhg √ì Donnchadha. The first 48 issues were numbered consecutively, with Volume 1 consisting of numbers 1-12, Volume 2 numbers 13-24 and so on. From Volume 5 in 1894 the numbering was 1-12 for each Volume. The Gaelic Journal was bilingual, with texts in Irish and English. There were also occasionally texts published in other languages, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and French. The content spanned many genres; folktales, literary texts, poetry, historical studies, fiction and drama, as well as articles on topics both academic and controversial. There was also a series of \\"Simple lessons in Irish\\", adapted from the series originally created by O'Growney for the Weekly Freeman. In an article that appeared under the title \\"Our Position\\" in the third number of the Gaelic Journal in January 1883, the causes and agencies that made the Gaelic Journal a reality are mentioned, as > (1) a growing taste among the reading portion of our people for things > national, and a juster idea of the value of such things as we can still call > our own; (2) the labours of devoted Irish scholars during the last fifty > years‚Äîas O'Donovan, O'Curry, Davis, Petrie, Todd, Archbishop MacHale, Canon > Bourke, S. H. O'Grady, John Fleming, Hennessy and Whitley Stokes‚Äîsome of > whom, happily, we have still amongst us; (3) the labours of continental > scholars in the general field of Indo-European philology, and more > particularly those of Pictet, Zeuss, Ebel, Gaidoz, de Jubainville, and > others in the special field of Celtic philology; (4) the labours of learned > bodies like the Royal Irish Academy, the Celtic Society, even those of the > Irish Archaeological Society, but more especially those of the Ossianic > Society; (5) the establishment of the \\"Society for the Preservation of the > Irish Language;\\" and (6) above all the formation of the Gaelic Union, for no > other society or body had ever thought or would ever think of so practical a > means of cultivating the language‚Äîor indeed, of cultivating the living > language at all. The causes that had \\"operated against the rise of a vernacular Irish press\\" are described as \\"beyond the scope and province of this journal to discuss,\\" before it is added that \\"but as they are obvious, there is all the less need to refer to them here\\".

The UDD called for Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and hold elections earlier than the end of term elections scheduled in 2012. The UDD demanded that the government stand down, but negotiations to set an election date failed. The protests escalated into prolonged violent confrontations between the protesters and the military, and attempts to negotiate a ceasefire failed. More than 80 civilians and six soldiers were killed, and more than 2,100 injured by the time the military violently put down the protest on 19 May. Overview Popular opposition to Abhisit Vejjajiva's government rose throughout 2009, due to the controversial 2008 \\"judicial coup\\" that banned the Palang Prachachon Party and \\"silent coup\\" that allowed the Democrats to form a coalition government.Manager ASTV, ‚Äú‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏¥‚Äù ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î‡πÉ‡∏à‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏£‡∏Å ‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏•‡∏∂‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏°‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏¢‡∏¥‡∏á ‡πÇ‡∏¢‡∏á‡∏ó‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Æ‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏≤, 1 May 2009 In February 2010, Abhisit tightened security in anticipation of the Supreme Court's ruling to seize former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's bank accounts, frozen since the 2006 military coup. The UDD did not protest, but announced protests on 14 March in Bangkok to call for new elections. Abhisit further tightened security. Censorship was heightened, and radio, TV stations and websites sympathetic to the UDD were closed. Estimates of the number of protesters on 14 March ranged from 50,000 (by the government) to 300,000 (by the UDD). At the beginning, protests were mostly peaceful, and initially centred at Phan Fa Lilat Bridge. Many protesters came from outside Bangkok, including from numerous provinces in the North and Northeast. After initial UDD unilateral demands for an early election were unsuccessful, dozens of M79 grenade attacks occurred far from Phan Fa, but there were no injuries and no arrests. In April, protesters shifted to Ratchaprasong intersection. A state of emergency was declared in Bangkok on 8 April, banning political assemblies of more than five persons. On 10 April, troops unsuccessfully cracked down at Phan Fa, resulting in 24 deaths, including a Japanese journalist and five soldiers, and more than 800 injuries. The Thai media called the crackdown \\"Cruel April\\" ().‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á, ‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πá‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á: ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏≠‡∏û‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡πå ‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÇ‡∏´‡∏î , 23 ‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏©‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏ô 2553. Further negotiations failed to set an election date. On 22 April, grenade attacks suspected to have been launched from Chulalongkorn Hospital killed one and wounded 86. UDD members invaded Chulalongkorn Hospital in an unsuccessful search for the attackers, drawing widespread condemnation from the Thai press, as the protests started to become substantially more siege-like, with barricades and armed guards creating a UDD fortress in the Ratchaprasong vicinity. Forensics expert Pornthip Rojanasunand later indicated that the hospital might or might not have been the origin of the grenade attacks. No arrests were made for either the grenade attack or the invasion of hospital.PRD, DSI: Origin of Silom grenade attacks yet to be concluded: National News Bureau of Thailand , 5 May 2010. A UDD proposal for elections in three months was rejected by Abhisit. On 28 April, the military and protesters clashed in northern Bangkok, wounding at least 16 protesters and killing one soldier. The UDD moved out of Phan Fa and consolidated at Ratchaprasong. On 3 May, Abhisit announced a reconciliation road map and elections on 14 November. The roadmap was tentatively accepted by the UDD, but after they included additional conditions, the government cancelled negotiations. By mid-May, the Ratchaprasong protest site camp was surrounded by armoured vehicles and snipers were positioned in case they were needed.CSM, Thai PM preps snipers, police to seal off Red-Shirt protest site, 13 May 2010 On the evening of 13 May, General Khattiya Sawasdiphol (\\"Seh Daeng\\"), security advisor to the protesters and leader of the armed \\"Ronin\\" guards known as the black shirts, was shot in the head by a sniper's bullet while he was giving an interview to press. It is unclear who fired the shot; speculation was it was ordered either by the army, by Thaksin to keep him quiet, or was simply a stray bullet. Thereafter, a state of emergency was expanded to 17 provinces and the military cracked down, dubbed by the Thai media as \\"savage May\\" (). An additional 41 civilians were killed (including one Italian journalist) and more than 250 were injured by 20:30, including soldiers.‡∏®‡∏π‡∏ô‡∏¢‡πå‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå‡∏â‡∏∏‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏â‡∏¥‡∏ô ‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£, ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ï‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏° ‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏ä.‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏ò‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏•‡∏ô‡πå, ‡∏û‡∏§‡∏©‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏≠‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏´‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏£‡πÇ‡∏ó‡∏©‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏• , 2 June 2010 One military death was attributed to friendly fire.TNN, ‡∏¢‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏®‡πÇ‡∏¢‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏ö‡∏ß‡∏µ‡πÇ‡∏Å‡πâ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏•‡∏°‡πÇ‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏î‡∏±‡∏ö1‡πÄ‡∏à‡πá‡∏ö1 , 17 May 2010 The government claimed that the civilians killed were either armed terrorists or were shot by terrorists, and insisted that some civilians were shot by terrorists disguised in army uniforms.Bangkok Post The military declared the area a \\"free-fire zone\\", in which anybody, be they protester, resident, tourist or journalist would be shot on sight, with medics banned from entering.The Nation, Medics banned from entering 'red zones' , 16 May 2010Brisbane Times, 16 dead, more likely as Thai authorities ramp up protest crack down, 15 May 2010 On 14 May, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon encouraged protesters and the government to reopen talks.United Nations, Ban calls on opposing sides in Thailand to avert bloodshed, resume talks, 14 May 2010 On 16 May, UDD leaders said again they were ready for talks as long as the military pulled back, but the government demanded the unconditional dispersal of the protesters.

He noted that if using the NTC to enforce the media crackdown was illegal, the government would try to pass a special law that would make such a crackdown legal.Matichon, ‡πÇ‡∏Ü‡∏©‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏£‡πå‡∏Ñ ‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏î \\"‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏¥‡∏ì\\" ‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ü‡∏≤‡∏£‡πå‡∏°‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Ç ‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏π‡∏Å‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏û‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏á ‡∏à‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏ä.‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ä‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏î‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô , 8 February 2010 The NTC acting secretary-general was a member of the government-appointed Situation Monitoring Committee in the run up to Thaksin's February court verdict. The first and last page of the Thaksin verdict signed by the nine supreme court judges The government claimed to foreign diplomats that the National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) would \\"spark violence\\" and \\"intensify its agitation and step up protests in Bangkok and around the country in order to disrupt the work of the government and the judiciary\\" in the period leading up to 26 February. On that date, the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions was scheduled to deliver its verdict on whether to seize former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's baht ) in assets that the military junta had frozen years earlier. Abhisit's father, a director of CP Foods, announced that he was spending 300,000 baht (US$9,300) a month to provide supplementary security for the premier. At noon of 1 February, bags of human excrement and fermented fish, were thrown at Abhisit's house. Abhisit linked the incident to Thaksin's assets seizure trial. The Deputy Prime Minister, Suthep Thaugsuban, (in charge of security), blamed the UDD for the incident. The perpetrator was arrested; he confessed and claimed that he threw the bags because he was fed up with police indifference to his complaints of people smoking cigarettes near his house. On the evening of 15 February, police and soldiers established scores of checkpoints and organised special patrols in inner Bangkok as reports from government security agencies continued to play up fears of anti-government rallies. Abhisit's government expected major UDD-led unrest immediately following the announcement of the Supreme Court's 26 February verdict. However, the UDD said they did not protest against the verdict. Instead they announced that they would hold a one million person protest in Bangkok on 14 March to call for elections. Rumours and suspicions that the protest was financed by Thaksin, as he had been found guilty, were widespread both in the media and among the population. The protesters arrived in Bangkok in smaller numbers than announced, wearing Thaksin face designs on their red tee shirts, flags, and banners. Estimates of the overall cost of the protest, given the number of protesters and the estimated sum that Thaksin had dedicated to it, led observers to guess that it could not last longer than two months. Although the number of protesters decreased from around 150,000 on the first weekend to no more than 5,000 on 19 May at the Ratchaprasong intersection, the two month estimates of duration of the protest proved to be accurate. Events leading up to 14 March protests Democrat Party of Thailand, Suthep Thaugsuban: relieved of security portfolio on 16 April 2010 Days prior to the planned protest on 14 March, checkpoints were set up to inspect caravans of protesters journeying to Bangkok. Police were given orders to detain any protester with weapons. Suthep Thaugsuban warned members of Cabinet that they and their families might become targets of UDD attacks. He denied the existence of a so- called blacklist \\"with 212 names of Thaksin's close relatives and associates, UDD leaders and activists, politicians from the opposition Pheu Thai Party, and even monks who appeared sympathetic to the Red Shirt cause\\". Suthep however admitted that the government had at least 10 key leaders of the Red Shirts under surveillance. Suthep accused the Pheu Thai Party of hiring people to participate in the protests. Prompong Nopparit, a spokesman of the Pheu Thai Party, denied the allegation and requested evidence that backed the accusation. Nopparit called on the prime minister to dissolve the House as demanded by the protesters. In anticipation of the protests, the government set up a tactical operations centre‚Äîcalled the Centre for the Administration of Peace and Order (also known as )‚Äîat the 11th Infantry Regiment in Bangkhen under the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC). In northeast Thailand, supporters of Abhisit's government issued threats against protesters to deter them from travelling to the Bangkok and provincial governors were ordered to obstruct the movement of people. Abhisit informed the Democrat Party-led Bangkok Metropolitan Administration that he had intelligence of planned bomb attacks at two locations and grenade attacks in 30‚Äì40 locations in Bangkok. He claimed that the protesters would include 2,000 \\"well-trained hardliners\\". He also claimed to have received intelligence that there was a terrorist threat of sabotage to take place on 14 March, but did not give details of the nature of the plot. When questioned about the matter, army spokesman Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said the army had no such intelligence.The Nation, Sabotage threat: PM , 7 March 2010 The UDD denied Abhisit's allegations and challenged him to reveal any evidence backing his claims. Suthep claimed that the UDD protesters planned to \\"besiege government offices and residences of important figures\\".

UDD leader Nattawut Saikua voiced suspicion that the army had staged the theft to pin blame on the UDD for any violence. A government raid on a car component factory found parts that could potentially be used to launch M79 grenades. Democrat Party spokesman Buranaj Smutharaks claimed that this showed that \\"there are violent elements\\" among the UDD. Government spokesperson Panitan later admitted that there was no evidence of a link between the parts and the UDD. On 9 March, the government issued an Internal Security Act (ISA) for the period 11 to 23 March.Dow Jones, Thai Cabinet Approves Imposition Of Internal Security Act, 9 March 2010 A 50,000-strong security force was deployed in Bangkok.

On 16 March, UDD protesters announced that they collect 10 cubic centimetres of blood from volunteers and symbolically pouring the blood at Government House and other sites in Bangkok. Peaceful rally in Bangkok, 20 March 2010 Negotiations between the protesters and the government failed to resolve the situation. The protesters insisted that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call fresh elections. The government refused to do so before it had amended the constitution. An estimated 100,000 demonstrators turned out on 20 March to parade 46 kilometres through Bangkok in a 10 kilometre-long convoy. This demonstration was peaceful, and aimed at gaining the support of local residents. As usual, the majority of the crowd were UDD Red Shirt activists who travelled from northern provinces to demonstrate, but there also appeared to be some local support lining the streets. However, critics claimed that demonstrators had been bribed by the organisation's leadership and that this was a common practice that characterised the polarity of class divisions within the UDD.The Diplomat Thailand's Blood Red Protest , 21 March 2010 On 27 March, protesters marched to seven locations in Bangkok where troops were stationed, convincing the troops to withdraw. Suthep Thaugsuban called the withdrawal a temporary \\"adjustment\\" and insisted that they would return to their positions later. Protesters expanded their protest to Ratchaprasong intersection, a major Bangkok commercial zone, in imitation of the People's Alliance for Democracy's (PAD) large-scale 2006 protests. The government claimed that the protests were illegal and attempted to evict the protesters without a court order, as the Civil Court had ruled that the prime minister is already empowered to do so. Abhisit's government alleged that the Red Shirt protesters were \\"rented\\". Shortly after the demonstrations in mid-March, state spokesman Thepthai scoffed at the apparent support for the UDD, claiming that each protester was given between 2,000 and 3,000 baht for participating. Bystanders, he alleged, were given 500 baht each. Thai English-language newspapers had claimed that protesters from rural areas had been paid to travel to Bangkok, just as previous Yellow Shirt protest organisers had also compensated protesters. There were dozens of bombings in Bangkok during the weeks of the protest, with nobody claiming responsibility and no arrests made. No one was killed in the bombings. In two separate incidents, a car was driven into a group of protesters, causing injury to people. One of the incidents occurred at Ratchaprasong intersection the other at Silom Road. April violence UDD protesters, 9 April 2010 On 3 April protesters occupied the shopping district of Ratchaprasong. The government declared a state of emergency on the evening of 8 April. The state of emergency permitted the military to detain people it considered a threat to national security, censor the media, and forbid gatherings of more than five persons. Troops barricaded the uplink station for the Thaicom satellite to prevent it from airing People Channel, a TV station operated and initiated by the UDD that had been broadcasting freely for a year, urging listeners to join the UDD and voicing anti-government sentiments. Protesters surrounded the station on the afternoon of 9 April. Tear gas was fired into the crowd, prompting the protesters to storm the station and the troops to withdraw. After negotiations, security forces allowed the station to resume broadcasting and protesters left the uplink station. The government again blocked the station's broadcasts soon after protesters left the scene.Business Week, Thai Protesters Vow to Fight as Government Again Blacks Out TV , 10 April 2010 On the afternoon and evening of 10 April, violent clashes occurred when government troops unsuccessfully tried to take back control of the Phan Fa Bridge protest site. Shots and tear gas grenades were fired near the Makhawan Bridge close to the United Nations Bangkok Headquarters Building during the afternoon as troops unsuccessfully attempted to take back the protest area. The troops retreated to the Ministry of Education after several hours. Later that evening, the violence escalated on Khao San Road and at the Khok Wua Intersection, with automatic fire, explosions, and tear gas being used. The violence died down by the early morning, with the temporary result being that the military was not able to seize the protest site. According to the Erawan Bangkok Emergency Medical Service Center, 25 people were killed in the clashes. The dead included Japanese cameraman Hiro Muramoto, 10 protesters, nine civilians and five uniformed soldiers. The Center noted more than 800 people injured. Autopsies revealed that 9 of the 10 dead protesters died of gunshots. The military reported that the soldiers killed died from cerebral edema after being hit on the head by thrown rocks. Following the clashes government troops withdrew. The military initially claimed that it used rubber bullets and tear gas in the clash, while firing live rounds only into the air. However, video footage from the international media showed soldiers firing assault rifles in fully automatic fire mode in the direction of protesters. Protest leaders claimed that a number of protesters were hit by army snipers from nearby buildings. The military later admitted that troops fired live rounds directly at protesters, allegedly shooting only single rounds to protect injured troops retreating from the clashes. Protesters allegedly used rocks, sticks, petrol bombs, but the military reported attacks involving also guns and grenades. Doctored video footage also purported to show people of an unknown affiliation but in support of the protesters (often referred to as \\"Black Shirts\\") firing weapons from the tops of buildings. At the height of the clash, it is reported that the Thai Army was met by \\"Black Shirts\\", a trained militia armed with M16s, AK-47s, and M-79 grenade launchers, which came in support of Red Shirt protesters. Thai Army commander Colonel Romklao Thuwatham was killed by a grenade attack (filmed by Reuter's journalist Hiro Muramoto, who died later that night from a bullet wound), which also wounded several top Army officers. That event induced an army retreat, leaving weapons and vehicles behind. Protesters seized a large quantity of military equipment left behind by retreating troops, including nine M16 assault rifles, 25 Tavor TAR-21 assault rifles, six .50 calibre machine guns, 116 riot shields, 105 batons and 80 suits of body armour. Troops also abandoned six armored personnel carriers and three high-mobility multi-purpose vehicles. Ammunition also went missing, including 580 rubber bullets, 600 .50 calibre rounds, and 8,182 M16 rifle rounds. 11 April: candles commemorating the casualties suffered by the protesters on 10 April Protesters remained unwilling to end their protest, and they vowed to continue their rally until the prime minister dissolved the House of Representatives and scheduled elections. One Red Shirt leader said that after Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolves the parliament, he must leave the country as soon as possible. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said the government has no plans to back down either. \\"The government will continue the operation to take back the roads from the protesters because their occupation is unlawful,\\" he said. Reactions to clashes On 12 April 2010, the Election Commission of Thailand called for the dissolution of Abhisit's Democrat Party. Meanwhile, Thai troops advanced on protesters in the early morning firing live ammunition. Protesters were repeatedly dispersed and driven back, but kept regrouping behind burning barricades, and threw numerous objects at the soldiers. By daybreak, the soldiers continued to charge the protesters, while being pelted with petrol bombs. Anti-government protesters said on 14 April 2010, they would all congregate at a single site in a Bangkok shopping district, preparing for a \\"final battle\\" with the authorities. On 16 April, Thai security service officers entered the SC Park Hotel to arrest the protest leaders whom the Deputy Prime Minister, Suthep Thaugsuban, called \\"terrorists\\". One of the opposition leaders, Arisman Pongruangrong, escaped by a rope from a window of the hotel as forces laid siege to the hotel. He said \\"[They] wanted to kill me. The policeman tried to kill me.\\" Although government officials admitted the raid was unsuccessful there were rumours that this was the start of a wider crackdown. Suthep said, \\"Innocent people should leave the protests because the authorities have to take decisive measures against terrorists.\\" On 16 April, Prime Minister Abhisit relieved Suthep from his security responsibilities and replaced him with the Commander of the Royal Thai Army, General Anupong Paochinda. In the subsequent week, several M-79 grenades were fired at government buildings, although no injuries were reported. Protesters, meanwhile, built barricades with sharpened bamboo in the Ratchaprasong tourist district. On 21 April anti-government protesters stopped a train carrying military vehicles in northeastern Thailand. Protesters, fearing the equipment was being moved to Bangkok, attacked the train in Khon Kaen, about 280 miles north of Bangkok. They demanded that 10 Red Shirt members accompany the train on its journey to ensure it did not reach Bangkok. Fritz Yee, a Filipino member of the Red Shirts, commented that the situation was becoming more and more uncontrollable among the Red Shirts and said while we \\"do not condone but we cannot control. There's no more control in the followers.\\" Explosions and pro-government rallies in Bangkok On the days leading up to 22 April, pro-government (\\"no color\\" or \\"multicolor shirts\\") rallies appeared in Bangkok alongside anti-government demonstrations for the first time. Some of the demonstrators were clearly pro- government, while others were just citizens weary of the disruption in their lives caused by the Red Shirts. On Wednesday, 21 April, the two groups clashed near the start of Silom Road. On 22 April, the two groups clashed again. According to BBC reporter Alastair Leithead, a small group of people \\"walked through police lines and started throwing bottles and stones towards barricades manned by Red Shirt protesters.\\" The Red Shirts responded by launching fireworks into the air. Pro-government protesters urged the military to attack, shouting \\"Fight, fight!\\" The police did not respond to the exchange. Anti-Thaksin Yellow Shirt protesters threatened \\"to step into the conflict and push out the Red Shirts themselves if the army doesn't take firmer action\\" against the Red Shirt protesters, who are being encouraged by Thaksin Shinawatra from abroad. Early on 22 April, the army warned Red Shirt protesters that their chances to cease and desist were \\"running out\\". Ten thousand troops were moved to central Bangkok. The military threatened to \\"use tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, if necessary\\", to combat the UDD protesters. \\"If we move in, we will attempt to arrest the leaders,\\" said army spokesman Colonel Sunsern Kaewkumnerd. \\"The government will be very decisive but in the beginning of the operation there may be chaos.\\" UDD leaders remained defiant, saying it was up to General Anupong Paochinda \\"whether to kill people or to stop the killing.\\" On the evening of 22 April, around 20:00, a series of explosions in Bangkok alleged by the government to have been the work of Red Shirt protesters killed one person and injured 86 more, including at least four foreigners. The explosions were caused by at least five M-79 grenades. Three of the grenades exploded at the Sala Daeng BTS station, one near the Dusit Thani Hotel, and one near a bank. It was the first time during the protests that a grenade attack occurred in a densely populated area and the first time that serious injuries occurred, although dozens of grenade attacks had occurred since the protest started. The government did not blame the Red Shirt movement for the attack, but rather unspecified \\"terrorists\\". Suthep stated, \\"the M79 launcher had a 400-metre shooting range and it was clear that it was shot from behind the King Rama VI Monument where the Red Shirts are rallying\\". Red Shirt leaders denied responsibility for the attacks. Following the blasts, Abhisit called an emergency meeting with security chiefs to assess the worsening crisis. Thaugsuban said the government had no immediate plans to crack down on the protester encampment because there are a large number of women and children at the site. A multi-agency investigation into the 10 and 22 April violence was announced. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the situation \\"a moment requiring restraint on all sides\\". Early on 23 April, riot police went to the edge of the protesters' barrier and demanded it be dismantled. After a short standoff, both sides backed away from the barrier. Ceasefire offer Barricades, Rama 4 and Silom Roads On 23 April, Red Shirt leader Veera Musikapong offered to end the protests if the government agreed to dissolve parliament within 30 days and hold elections within days. \\"If the government accepts and is open to the talks, we are ready to disperse to restore peace in the country,\\" he said. He further implied that protest sites must not be attacked during any potential negotiations, and that an independent inquiry into the recent violence must be conducted. The offer marked a change from the protesters previous demand that parliament be dissolved immediately. After talking with the opposition, Abhisit rejected their offer saying \\"Because they use violence and intimidation I cannot accept this [offer]\\". \\"The 30-day ultimatum is not an issue,\\" he added. \\"The dissolution [of parliament] must be done for the benefit of the entire country, not just for the Red Shirts, and it must be done at the right time.\\" Abhisit promised to clear up the situation when he gave his weekly address on 25 April. On 26 April 2010, the Election Commission's request to dissolve the Democrat Party was forwarded to the Constitutional Court. The move prompted King Bhumibol Adulyadej to break his silence on the protests, telling the group of newly appointed judges of courts of justice to show steadfastness and to carry out their duties \\"strictly and honestly.\\" Conflict resumes A soldier was killed and 18 protesters wounded in clashes between security forces and UDD members on Wednesday, 28 April. The clashes had started when troops and riot police blocked UDD protesters from going to Talad Thai to campaign for the anti-government rally. Protesters had attempted to advance on the security forces, but were repelled by troops and police officers using tear gas and rubber bullets. Security forces then began to push forward, and drive protesters back down the highway using live ammunition, and fighting resumed after a temporary calm. After several hours, security forces regained control of the area, and dispersed the protest. The soldier who died was shot in the head, apparently by accidental friendly fire, during a tense confrontation. It was the 27th fatality since UDD supporters set up their protest camp on the streets of Bangkok. On 30 April, more than 200 Red Shirt protesters forced their way into Chulalongkorn Hospital, which was close to the main protest camp, searching for soldiers they claimed were hiding there. No soldiers were found in an hour of searching, during which time nurses were threatened and many patients frightened. The next day, some 600 patients were evacuated to hospitals far from the protest site. UDD leader Weng Tojirakarn, himself a medical doctor, apologised for the assault on the hospital, calling it \\"inappropriate\\" and \\"unreasonable\\". Reuters described the incident as \\"a clumsy storming of a hospital that raised questions over whether the movement is losing direction\\". On 2 May, Abhisit said that his government was preparing to end the standoff. A special cabinet meeting ruled out declaring martial law, but authorised to upgrade the police force in Bangkok. Abhist told reporters, \\"We are sending a clear signal that we've given a lot of time for people to leave Ratchaprasong ... we are now in the process of cutting off support and seal the area off before we actively move in.\\" He declined to be more specific about when troops would move in. \\"We continue to exercise restraint and patience ... but the public patience is running out and the government has to ... uphold the law [for] the majority of Thai society,\\" he added. By 2 May, as many as 100,000 people had lost their jobs, gone bankrupt, or both, as a result of the protests shutting down Bangkok. The government is planning on providing special assistance for those affected. The actions taken by the Red Shirts were described by an Abu Dhabi newspaper, The National, as more than mere protesting, but even as \\"insurrection\\". However, the number of protesters was decreasing and rumours spread that the protesters were financed by former PM Thaksin to get his conviction revoked. Election proposal On 3 May, Abhisit proposed to dissolve parliament in September and hold an election on 14 November if the protesters were willing to stand down. The following day Red Shirt leaders expressed qualified support for the plan, but wanted more information about when parliament would be dissolved. On the morning of 8 May, two policemen were killed and several bystanders were injured by a drive-by shooting near the Silom financial district. Red Shirt leader Weng Tojirakarn denied any involvement: \\"We are very sorry and we want to condemn the ones who were behind the attacks.\\" Protesters demanded that Thailand's deputy prime minister be arrested for causing the deaths of 25 protesters when troops were used against protests on 10 April. The protesters refused to end the rally, and on 13 May, the offer of an election was withdrawn. May violence Wounded protester carried away from Rama 4 Road to safety, 15 May 2010 A Type 85 AFV prepares to assault the Red Shirt barricade at Sala Daeng intersection, 19 May 2010 Burning fire engine, Chiang Mai, 19 May 2010 On Friday, 14 May, Thai police and army units to surround and cut off the protesters main camp, meeting heavy resistance from the Red Shirts resulting in the deaths of two people with dozens more injured, including Thai Army Major General Khattiya Sawasdipol, better known as Seh Daeng ('Commander Red'), a self-described key military adviser to the Red Shirts who was suspended from duty in the Thai army. A backer and part of the protesters' more radical wing, he had accused Red Shirt leaders of not being hard line enough. He was hit in the head by a sniper's bullet and died a few days later on 17 May. One of the Red Shirt leaders, Nattawut Saikua, accused Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of starting a civil war. This came as there were reports of a policeman opening fire on soldiers near a police station in Bangkok, showing that there may have been divisions within the security services themselves. Both the British and US embassies in Bangkok were closed for security reasons. Just before 15:00 GMT on 14 May, Sky News reported that the death toll from the latest fighting had risen to five, with 46 others wounded. People in Bangkok claimed that the area has descended into a war zone as the two sides battled for control. During the clashes, France 24 journalist Nelson Rand was \\"gravely wounded\\" by bullets from an army assault rifle, although who actually used the weapon is unknown. On Friday night, several grenade explosions were heard from a nearby shopping centre and municipal railway station in the upscale shopping area. As of 18:00, 14 May, the BBC reported that seven people had died and over 100 were wounded in the latest violence in Bangkok. Canada announced the temporary closure of its embassy. According to The Telegraph, as of 21:40 GMT, 14 May, at least 16 people had been killed, none of whom were members of the security services. There were several incidents of police officers joining with the Red Shirts and exchanging fire with the army, prompting fears that a civil war was imminent. The number of injured was thought to be 157, with that number predicted to rise significantly as fighting continued. By 02:20 GMT on 15 May, the death toll reached 16, with more than 157 injured. Street battles continued, with no end in sight. Total casualties since 12 May amounted to 24 killed, with 187 injured on the night of 14‚Äì15 May alone. One of the dead was a sergeant of the Royal Thai Air Force, who was killed by friendly fire. Protest leaders once again warned of civil war if the army attempted to storm their camp. Several areas of the city near the protesters were designated as \\"live fire zones\\" by the military, and protesters entering these zones were to be shot on sight. Due to food and water shortages as a result of the army blockade, it was estimated the protesters would only be able to hold out for a few more days, and after that have to start plundering local shops. On 16 May, the death-toll rose to 33, with the number of wounded rising to 230. Reporters in the vicinity of the violence had to cancel live broadcasts due to the threat of sniper attacks from military forces in the area. The government urged the very young and very old to leave the camp by Monday afternoon, prompting fears of an army crackdown. They also started telling the public that the foreign media, such as CNN, BBC, Reuters, and others, could not be trusted as they are biased. On 17 May Thai Army Major General Khattiya Sawasdiphol, who was shot in the head by a sniper on 13 May, died. On 17 May, Thai military helicopters dropped leaflets on the Red Shirt's main encampment, urging them to leave. The Red Shirts responded by firing homemade rockets at the helicopters. The encampment was completely surrounded, and the Thai government gave Red Shirts a deadline of 15:00 to withdraw. Clashes continued, with Thai troops firing directly towards or at any movement around the protest perimeter with live ammunition, and protesters also using potentially lethal tactics, according to a Canadian journalist. Red Shirts shot fireworks at the army, and used a broom handle to rapidly fire firecrackers. At least two Red Shirt protesters were shot by army snipers. According to medical officials, the casualty toll stood at 35 dead, and 242 wounded. By the end of the day, the casualty toll had risen to 37 dead and 266 wounded. Sporadic clashes continued on 18 May, but these skirmishes were less intense than previous confrontations. The death toll rose to 39 as the day progressed, and it was thought that a military crackdown was imminent as troops and armoured personnel carriers (APC)s gathered around the protest site urging residents and protesters to leave. The army moved in soon afterwards, backed by armoured personnel carriers and smashed through the protesters main barricades. Two Red Shirts were shot and wounded during the opening stages of this operation as other Red Shirts set alight the kerosene-soaked barricades to deter advancing soldiers and obscure their view. On 19 May, the army launched an all out assault using APCs and defeated Red Shirts defences, leaving at least five dead, including an Italian journalist and two soldiers were seriously wounded in a grenade attack. The protest leaders surrendered to police in a bid to avoid further bloodshed. Fighting between Red Shirts and the army continued in many parts of the city. Red Shirts set fire to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, banks, at least two shopping centres (including Central World at the Red Shirt's main protest site), a TV station, a cinema which burned to the ground, and hotels had to build barricades to protect themselves. The total number of burnt buildings was 35. The total death toll since 14 May is believed to stand at 44. Thaksin, from his refuge in Montenegro, denied influencing the Red Shirt movement. There were reports of clashes in Thailand's northern provinces after the surrender was announced, resulting in a town hall being burned by Red Shirts in Udon Thani Province. Since 14 May, 51 people were killed in clashes, 12 of whom died during the army crackdown and subsequent fighting in Bangkok. The casualty count as of 22 May stood at 85 dead and 1,378 injured. Death of Fabio Polenghi Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban claimed that Italian photographer Fabio Polenghi was killed by a grenade launched from a terrorist M79 and died side by side with a soldier. Numerous other reports, including one by the International Federation of Journalists, noted that Polenghi was shot.International Federation of Journalists, Condemns Killing of Second Journalist in Thailand, 20 May 2010Matichon, ‡∏™‡∏´‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏Ø‡πÅ‡∏ñ‡∏•‡∏á‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ì‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏ú‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏°. ‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏≥‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏¢‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á ‡∏™‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏ä‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏á‡πâ‡∏≤ , 20 May 2010 Autopsy results showed that Polenghi died from a high velocity bullet that entered his heart and caused damage to his lungs and liver.Thai Rath, ‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ï‡∏∏‡∏à‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏• , 26 May 2010Nation News Channel, ‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏ó‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏π‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏µ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏®‡∏û‡∏ä‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô , 20 May 2010 A reporter from Der Spiegel who was with Polenghi noted that he was photographing from the protesters' side and was running from advancing soldiers.Spiegel Online, The Day the Thai Army Moved In, 24 May 2010 The Italian Embassy pursued its own investigations. Investigations A government-ordered independent investigation exonerated the military and security forces of all blame in the killings.

According to US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, \\"...the TRCT's final report seems to give a balanced treatment to both sides involved in the political violence two years ago‚Äîalleging that both the UDD and government security forces, including the military, were responsible for escalating the situation.\\" 19 September 2010 rally Protest at Ratchaprasong intersection The Red Shirts organised mass rallies across Thailand to mark the ousting of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin by a military coup four years earlier, and to mark the final day of the military crackdown on their protests four months ago which left 91 people dead. The peaceful gathering at Ratchaprasong intersection, an area in downtown Bangkok which was occupied by the Red Shirts between 3 April 2010 and 19 May 2010, the day that the Thai military ended the protests and on which day the protesters set fire to many buildings across Thailand including CentralWorld in Bangkok, attracted approximately 10,000 demonstrators. 2011 Protests continued, as both the Red Shirt UDD and the Yellow Shirt PAD scheduled protests for mid-February 2011. CAPO (Center for the Administration of Peace and Order), first established in August 2009, was re- established to supervise imposition of Chapter 2 of the Internal Security Act (ISA) in seven districts of Bangkok, from 9 to 23 February, to control rallies planned by the PAD and the UDD; the local reaction to the Cambodian‚ÄìThai border dispute forms a background to the revival of the CAPO. These protests continued in Bangkok and other cities until July, at times drawing hundreds of thousands of people, but rarely involving violence or conflict otherwise. Continuing protests in early-2011 drew condemnation from the Ratchaprasong Square Trade Association, which claimed that the protests breached the constitution by infringing upon the rights of others, whereby the ongoing gatherings closed streets in the Ratchaprasong area. Since the July 2011 election, political gatherings in public abated.

The club currently fields Men's teams in Midwest Divisions III & IV and a Women's team in the Midwest Division II. They play their home games at Dayton Rugby Grounds. As well as a number of players also coaching at various levels, there are also a few club members who have gone on to continue their involvement in the sport by becoming referees. History=Men's Squad Rugby first came to Dayton, Ohio in the fall of 1969 when a group of University of Dayton students, led by Bob Borgerding, played their first rugby match. The University of Dayton continues to play rugby to this day, fielding both a Men's and a Women's squad. Club rugby came onto the scene in 1973 with the founding of the Dayton Triangles RFC, named for the first champion of the National Football League, the Dayton Triangles. This name was soon changed to the Miami Valley Rugby Football Club (RFC), later changing its name to Dayton RFC. At the same time, Wright State University RFC spun off the Gem City RFC. Unfortunately, Wright State‚Äôs squad folded soon after Gem City RFC was established, Wright State was able to reestablish its club later. At the same time the Wittenberg University RFC and Wright-Patt Jets RFC developed from the Dayton RFC. In the early 1980s, the Dayton RFC and Gem City RFC merged to form the Dayton Argylls RFC. This arrangement lasted until the early 1990s, when the Dayton Argylls RFC and the Wright-Patt Jets RFC merged. The current squad logo, which gives the squad its nickname of Flying Pigs, is a winged wild boar, which was chosen as a merger of the Argylls‚Äô boar logo and the Wright Patt Jets' jet aircraft logo. Over the years, rugby squads in the Dayton area have been very successful. In fifteens competition, the Wright Patt. Jets were Military National Champions. The Argylls, in their final season, placed third in the Midwest Division II Championship. The Flying Pigs qualified for the Midwest Division II Championships in both 1994, 1995, and 2011, placing second in 1994. Dayton has had success in rugby sevens as well, qualifying for the national championship in 1984 and 1985. In 2016 Dayton added a second team, and currently compete in Midwest Divisions III & IV. Women's Squad The first women's squad was started in 1979 and lasted into the next decade. The Women's squad was reformed in 1999 by Lola Akinmade. The squad has been very successful, winning the Midwest Division II Women‚Äôs Championship and finishing third in the nation in 2002. During part of its existence, the squad was merged with the women's squad of the Cincinnati Kelts; after a few years as the joint Cincinnati-Dayton Women's squad the team split in 2006 to rejoin their respective city clubs. Venues The club has lived up to its current name over the years, using many different venues around the Greater Dayton area. Before the team secured the use of green space for the permanent placement of at Eastwood, in 2007, venues they have used have included Dayton's Carillon Park and Centerville's Leonard E. Stubbs Memorial Park. In January 2012, the independent Five Rivers Youth Rugby Foundation, (FRYRF), was formed in Dayton. Led by Chris Schreel and Frank Harris, FRYRF purchased the Fenner Fields baseball complex in north Dayton, renaming the facility as Dayton Rugby Grounds (DRG). The rugby community of the Dayton Area worked to turn the seven baseball diamonds into rugby pitches. Much of the work was carried out by volunteers from the club, which has established a Use Agreement with FRYRF to use DRG as their home pitch and beginning Fall of 2013. In 2013, DRG finish leveling their second pitch and began use in the Fall of 2015.

Inmates included John White Webster. Notorious for its overcrowding, the facility closed in 1851, when inmates were installed in the nearby, newly built Charles Street Jail, also in the West End. History Detail of 1829 map of Boston, showing Leverett St. Jail in the West End inmate labor) at the Leverett St. House of Correction, 1825 (Columbian Centinel) Begun around 1819, the \\"new gaol in Leverett-street\\" opened in 1822. Prior to that time, many had recognized the previous town jail (since the 1630s located off Court Street) as inadequate. In 1823, \\"on inspecting the common jails of the city, in Leverett Street, it was found that, of the two stone prisons there situated, one was amply sufficient for all the usual exigencies of the courts of justice. It was determined, therefore, to convert the other into a house of correction, and employ the inmates in the adjoining jail-yard in hammering stone and like materials.\\" Thus \\"there were two separate prisons within the same enclosure.\\" Architecture Architecturally, \\"the Leverett Street jail was considered very secure, walls and floors being composed of large blocks of hewn stone clamped together with iron, while between the courses loose cannon- balls were laid in cavities hollowed out for the purpose.\\" Inmates Don Pedro Gibert and his pirate associates on trial in Boston in 1834 were held in the Leverett Street jail.For more on the trial, see: In 1835 abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison was held in the jail temporarily for his own protection when a mob turned against him. Others held in the prison included, for instance, people in custody after police raids on Ann Street. One night in 1851, \\"165 persons of all ages, sexes, nations and colors ... were marched off in pairs to the Leverett Street Jail ... for the various crimes of piping, fiddling, dancing, drinking, and all their attendant vices.\\" Executions took place at the jail. In 1831, \\"Joseph Gadett and Thomas Colinett [were hanged] ... for piracy,\\" and in 1834 Henry Joseph also. In 1850, Dr. Webster of the highly publicized George Parkman murder case was executed. Conditions in the prison The conditions in the jail were widely criticized. Prisoners lived crowded together, regardless of the mildness (e.g. minor debt) or severity of their crime. \\"The new, costly, and elegant prison ... is so constructed as not to admit of a proper separation of its inmates.\\" By 1831, \\"the true character of this place is beginning to be understood:\\" > The crowded night rooms; the 1,000 debtors annually, and the 1,000 criminals > and vagrants; the men and the women; the old men and black boys; the idiots, > the lunatics and the drunkards; all confined in two buildings at night, and > on the Sabbath, in which there can be no separation, and no effectual > supervision or restraint, to prevent gambling and falsehood, profane > swearing and lascivious conversation, wrath, strife, backbiting and revenge. In 1833 the city built a new House of Correction in South Boston, designed on the Auburn system (an improvement at the time). After 1833 \\"as the city and county lock-up the Leverett Street Jail held inmates who were awaiting trial and also those who had been sentenced to the [South Boston] House of Correction and were waiting for transport there. \\" \\"De Beaumont and de Tocqueville declared the House of Correction in South Boston to be a model for similar establishments, and the county jail in Leverett Street just the opposite.\\" In other words, conditions improved for inmates in the new South Boston prison, but remained objectionable for inmates remaining at Leverett Street. By around 1843, > it will cause sorrow and pain to the citizens of Boston that ... we still > have a jail, on Leverett Street, which has been presented as a nuisance by > the grand jury; which has had proceedings instituted against it, year after > year, by the city government ... and yet there is not final action for its > removal or change. In 1851 \\"it was finally replaced by a new jail on Charles > Street known as the Charles Street Jail.\\" The old jail building on Leverett > Street stood until at least 1856.

History Construction of the building began in 1546, as a legacy of Don Fadrique Enr√≠quez de Ribera, who had died in 1539. It was designed by Mart√≠n de Gainza, who directed the construction until his death in 1556. Two years later, Hern√°n Ruiz II took over the works, and the building was inaugurated, although still incomplete, in 1558. The building is on a rectangular plan, originally intended to be built around 10 courtyards, of which only nine were constructed and only eight survive as of the early 21st century. The most distinctive element of the building is its church, situated in the central courtyard of the left side. It is built on a Latin cross plan and is broadly in the style of the Spanish Renaissance. Its distinguished main altarpiece was designed by Diego L√≥pez Bueno with paintings by Alonso V√°zquez based on designs by Asensio de Maeda. The church is taller than the rest of the building. Its interior is now the site of the plenary sessions of the Andalusian parliament. The building functioned as a hospital until 1972. After being abandoned for several years, in 1986 plans were drawn up to convert it to the seat of the parliament of the autonomous community of Andalusia.

The aim was to create an air link between Egypt, Mandate Palestine and British Mandate of Mesopotamia (Iraq), which were under British control following the end of World War I. The western end of the route was the airfield at Heliopolis, on the outskirts of Cairo. The eastern end was at Hinaidi airfield, just south of Baghdad. It was intended the route would eventually extend to India. In 1921 A L Holt was involved with creating the track across the Syrian desert from Baghdad to the eastern edge of the basalt desert in Jordan, which was to act as a guide track for the pilots of the Cairo ‚Äì Baghdad air route.The Baghdad Air Mail Wing Commander Roderick Hill, 1929 reprinted in 2005 by Nonsuch Books, 23-4 The route was opened on 23 June 1921 and the first mail was carried on 28 July 1921. The aircraft used were RAF Vickers Vernons, twin-engined biplanes were capable of carrying up to seven passengers and mail, but, for longer endurance, usually carried a smaller load. Initially the price of mail was 1 shilling an ounce, but as the route became established this was reduced to 3d (old pence). Imperial Airways de Havilland Hercules G-EBMW was used on the route The route was 866 miles long and comprised two sections. The Western third (326 miles) was mostly over the well populated coastal plains between the Nile and the Dead Sea, where there were plenty of landmarks by which to steer. The Eastern section (540 miles) was over the Jordanian and Iraqi deserts, uninhabited except for nomadic tribes and with few landmarks. A visible track over this part of the route was laid across the ground by the wheels of an armoured car driven for this purpose, or by a plough pulled by a Fordson tractor, depending upon the nature of the terrain. 26 emergency landing grounds were made in the desert, several of which included spare tanks of fuel. In 1926 Imperial Airways took over the route from the RAF. Using three-engined de Havilland Hercules aircraft of greater range than the Vernons, the route was extended first to Basra and then to India, as part of an air passenger service.

The Dispensary is one of the most finely decorated buildings of Stone Town and a symbol of the multi-cultural architecture and heritage of the city. Its wooden carved balconies, with stained glass decorations, are of Indian influence; the main structure is built with traditional Zanzibari coral rag and limestone, but covered with stucco adornments of European neo-classical taste.Zanzibar Stone Town Projects: Conservation Works in the Former Old Dispensary, Aga Khan Trust for Culture The inside of the building is just as sophisticated, with a covered courtyard and carved bridges connecting the floors. The Dispensary is one of Stone Town's major tourist attractions. It has a small museum about the history of Zanzibar. History The inner courtyard The construction of the Old Dispensary was commissioned in 1887 by Tharia Topan, a wealthy Ismaili Indian, to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Topan's intent was for the building to be used as a charitable hospital for the poor. When he died in 1891, the building was not finished.

That same year, as a consequence of a family quarrel, the building was sold off to a new owner, who finally brought it to completion in 1894.Stone Town Cultural Centre In 1900 the building was bought by another prominent Indian merchant living in Zanzibar, Haji Nasser Nurmohamed,Tharia Topan who decided that the ground floor would be used as a dispensary, while the upper floors were partitioned into apartments. In 1964, following the Zanzibar Revolution (whereby most Zanzibari Indians, including those who lived in the dispensary, fled abroad), the building was requisitioned by the government, and later fell into disuse and decay. In 1990, as a part of a general plan for the renovation of the historical buildings of Stone Town, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture obtained from the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar the permission to restore the Dispensary.

The Line The railway was built by the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway in 1856, with the principal aim of carrying iron ore from the Forest of Dean to furnaces near Nantyglo. It was authorised under an Act of Parliament dated 20 August 1853, to operate from a junction with the Newport, Abergavenny & Hereford Railway, near Pontypool, to Coleford, Gloucestershire, with a branch to serve the gas works at Monmouth. Diverging at Little Mill Junction, north west of Pontypool Road railway station, the line ran to Monmouth Troy railway station. The from Little Mill Junction to Usk were opened on 2 June 1856, the line was worked by the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway. The onwards to Monmouth Troy opened on 12 October 1857 when the company worked its line with engines hired from the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway. alt=A rusty plate girder bridge crosses the river, supported by a single stone pier Of the several stations on the line only Usk and Monmouth Troy had two platforms. The station site at Usk was cramped between the River Usk and the Tunnel, so the goods yard stood away on the western side of the river. From 1940 to 1946, the Little Mill Junction to Glascoed section of the line further west was heavily used to carry shift workers from the Eastern Valleys to the Royal Ordnance Factories' munitions production site's three platform station. Otherwise, passenger traffic was always light, although some attempts were made to revive ailing fortunes with the addition of an evening train from Monmouth and the opening of a halt at Elm Bridge in the 1930s. The line was closed to passengers on 30 May 1955. A centenary special train was run on 12 October 1957. Usk tunnel View of the Western portal of Usk Tunnel in 2008 The tunnel adjacent to the station was cut through the hill immediately to the east of the station. The tunnel was carved through sandstone, from which several fossils were preserved in the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff. Both tunnel portals are masonry. The eastern one is supported by substantial buttresses. Whilst the roof is bricked-lined, the walls and occasional refuges are a mixture of brick and stone. The profile of the tunnel varies, notably in the centre marked by a pair of strengthening rings. It is reputed that King Edward VIII slept overnight in the tunnel aboard the Royal Train, possibly on the night of 18 November 1936. The tunnel is now officially part of a footpath - it is broad, relatively straight and the floor has been raised with infill to ease passage. It is possible to navigate the tunnel without artificial light.

Binz 2006 page 97 The joint devotion to the hearts was first formalized in the 17th century by Saint Jean Eudes who organized the scriptural, theological and liturgical sources relating to the devotions and obtained the approbation of the Church, shortly before the purported visions of Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque. He wrote the Mass and Office proper to the feasts, composed various prayers and rosaries and wrote the first book on the topic.Praying with the saints by Woodeene Koenig-Bricker 2001 page 134 In the 18th and 19th centuries, northern and central France became fertile ground for the growth of devotions to the hearts of Jesus and Mary, both jointly and individually with Catherine Labour√©'s Miraculous Medal depicting the Heart of Jesus thorn-crowned and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword.Butler's lives of the saints, Volume 12 by Alban Butler, Kathleen Jones, 2000 page 245 The devotions, and the associated prayers, continued into the 20th century, e.g. in prayers by Saint Maximillian Kolbe which built on the Montfortean theme of \\"Jesus through Mary\\" and the reported messages of Our Lady of F√°tima which stated that the Heart of Jesus wishes to be honored together with the Heart of Mary.The children of Fatima: Blessed Francisco & Blessed Jacinta Marto by Leo Madigan 2003 OSV Press page 248 Various popes have supported the individual and joint devotions to the hearts through the centuries. In the 1956 encyclical Haurietis aquas, Pope Pius XII encouraged the joint devotion to the hearts. In the 1979 encyclical Redemptor hominis Pope John Paul II explained the theme of unity of Mary's Immaculate Heart with the Sacred Heart. In his Angelus address on September 15, 1985 Pope John Paul II coined the term The Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at F√°tima, Portugal.Proceedings of the International Theological Symposium on the Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, September 1986, Fatima, Portugal History The Hearts of Jesus and Mary are mentioned explicitly only briefly in the New Testament. Luke 2:19 states: \\"Mary kept all these things pondering them in her heart\\", and Luke 2:51: \\"His Mother kept all these things carefully in Her Heart\\". John 7:38 refers to the heart of Jesus: \\"From His Heart will flow rivers of living water.\\" From the 2nd century onward, according to Pope Pius XII, saints and Church Fathers occasionally referred to the two Hearts. Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus on its own dates back to the 11th century and was addressed by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and Saint Gertrude the Great in the 12th and 13th centuries. Saint Bonaventure referred to the Heart of Jesus and the Heart of Mary throughout his writings during the 13th century, but the most poignant passage is in the devotional work The Mystical Vine, a description of the Passion of Christ. The joint devotion to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary formally started in the 17th century. Saint Jean Eudes (1601‚Äì1680) established the Society of the Heart of the Mother Most Admirable, which resembled the Third Order of Saint Francis and dedicated the seminary chapels of Caen and Coutances to the Sacred Hearts. Although Jean Eudes always associated the two Sacred Hearts, he began his devotional teachings with the Heart of Mary, and then extended it to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.Life Of The Venerable John Eudes by Charles De Montzey, Cousens Press 2008, page 215 Eudes was partly influenced by the writings of Saint Francis de Sales on the perfections of the Heart of Mary as the model of love for God.Mary's Immaculate Heart by John F. Murphy 2007 page 24 Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie co-founded the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary with Peter Coudrin in 1800. Jean Eudes organized the scriptural, theological and liturgical sources relating to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and promoted them with the approbation of the Church. The feast of the Holy Heart of Mary was celebrated for the first time in 1648, and that of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1670. The Mass and Office proper to these feasts were composed by Saint Jean Eudes in 1668, briefly preceding Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque in establishing the devotion to the Sacred Hearts. He composed various prayers and rosaries to the Sacred Hearts. His book \\"Le C≈ìur Admirable de la Tr√®s Sainte M√®re de Dieu\\" is the first book ever written on the devotion to the Sacred Hearts.From Trent to Vatican II: historical and theological investigations by Raymond F. Bulman, Frederick J. Parrella 2006 page 182 The Miraculous Medal (1830) depicts the two Hearts together below a cross. In December 1673 Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque reported a vision of Christ in which Jesus showed her the Sacred Heart.Life of Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque of the Sacred Heart by Albert Barry 2008 page 72 After her death in 1690, the devotion was promoted by the Jesuits. Devotion to the two Hearts continued to spread in France. On Christmas Eve in 1800, amid the French Revolution, knowing they could face the guillotine for their actions, Peter Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie established the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary with a mission to spread the message of God's love manifested through the Hearts of Jesus and Mary and through the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Future members of the congregation included Saint Damien de Veuster of Molokai. By the beginning of the 19th century the devotion to the Immaculate Heart was sufficiently widespread in Europe for Pope Pius VII to allow a feast to honor it in 1805.Saints and feasts of the liturgical year by Joseph N. Tylenda 2003 page 118 Since the 19th century there has been a steady increase in Roman Catholic devotion to the Heart of Mary, and devotional images of the Virgin Mary pointing to Her sinlessly glowing Heart have become widespread.Baker, Kenneth. Fundamentals of Catholicism: God, Trinity, Creation, Christ, Mary, 1983 p. 382 Many images of the Immaculate Heart of Mary still show it as pierced or wounded and, in some cases, as bleeding.Michael Freze, 1989, They Bore the Wounds of Christ, OSV Publishing page 33 Other orders and devotions continued thereafter; for example, the Order of the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary was founded in 1866 by Father Victor Braun. Pope Pius XII consecrated the human race to the Immaculate Heart on December 8, 1942. In 1944 he extended the feast to the universal Church and set its date of celebration on August 22. Because August 22 is now the feast of the Queenship of Mary, the feast of the Immaculate heart is celebrated the day after the Sacred Heart. Joint devotions and prayers A modern devotional representation of the two hearts. Catholic devotions view the Heart of Jesus as the source of God's love and charity and the Heart of Mary as flowing with compassion. Devotions to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary are linked in historical, theological and spiritual ways. Terms such as the Holy Heart, Agonizing Heart and Compassionate Heart have also been used in devotions.Mary's Immaculate Heart by John F. Murphy 2007 pages 59-60Heart of the Redeemer by Timothy Terrance O'Donnell, 1992 page 272 The object of the devotion to the Heart of Mary is her physical Heart that burned so intensely with love for God. Because of the inherently close relationship of Mary and Jesus in the Catholic teachings on salvation, the Heart of Mary is associated with the Heart of Jesus. The Sacred Heart is viewed as the source of God's boundless love and charity, while the devotion to the Immaculate Heart stresses the nature of Mary's love and concern for all who call upon her.An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies by Orlando O. Esp√≠n, James B. Nickoloff page 610 The two Hearts are linked by devotions, prayers and feasts. The Catholic Feast of the Immaculate Heart, which is on a Saturday, is celebrated the day after the Feast of the Sacred Heart which always falls on a Friday, 19 days after Pentecost.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 94, 135 Catholic devotional guides encourage the faithful to honor them together in celebration of God's generous love.Clean of Heart by Rosemarie Scott 2006 page 53 The link and the relationship between the Hearts of Jesus and Mary is also manifested in various Catholic prayers. The conclusion to the private devotional, theLitany of the Sacred Heart of Mary is an example: > O most merciful God, Who, for the salvation of sinners and the refuge of the > miserable, wast pleased that the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary > should be most like in charity and pity to the Divine Heart of Thy Son Jesus > Christ; grant that we, who commemorate this most sweet and loving Heart, may > by the merits and intercession of the same Blessed Virgin merit to be found > according to the Heart of Jesus. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.The > Catholic's vade-mecum: a select manual of prayers for daily use London 1851, > Published by Burns and Lambert ASIN B002JPK7N4 page 337 Prayers to the Agonizing Heart of Jesus also relate it to the Heart of Mary: * Agonizing Heart of Jesus, Beloved of the Father, Living Temple of the Holy Spirit, delight of the Immaculate Heart of Mary - I adore Thee and I love Thee, have pity on the dying.Lyonnard, Jean. Perpetual Intercession to the Agonizing Heart of Jesus by Jean Lyonnard 2009 p. 77 * Mary conceived without sin, pray for us, who trust in Thee. Praised be the Agonizing Heart of Jesus! Praised be the Compassionate Heart of Mary! The Eucharist in a Monstrance. A third devotional element often associated with the Hearts of Jesus and Mary is the Body and Blood of Christ represented in the Eucharist. The view of the sacraments as gifts to the Church positions the Hearts as the primary channel of Christ's boundless love and Mary's endless compassion.Heart of the Redeemer by Timothy Terrance O'Donnell, 1992 page 275 The Morning offering specifically refers to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in offering reparation for sins to the Sacred Heart of Jesus:Hearts on fire: praying with Jesuits by Michael Harter 2005 page 13Handbook of Prayers 2006 by James Soc√≠as page 42 :O Jesus through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, :I offer You my prayers, works, joys, sufferings of this day, :in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world. :I offer them for all the intentions of Your Sacred Heart: :the salvation of souls, the reparation for sin, the reunion of Christians; :and in particular for the intentions of the Holy Father this month. :Amen. Saints and the Blessed Since the 17th century, the devotions to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, individually and jointly, have been promoted and encouraged by a number of saints and the blessed. While Saint Jean Eudes was the main force in formalizing and promoting the joint devotion to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the efforts of other saints prepared the environment in which the devotion could flourish. Pope Leo XIII gave Jean Eudes the title of \\"Author of the Liturgical Worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Holy Heart of Mary\\" and both popes Leo XIII and Pius X called Eudes the \\"father, teacher and first apostle\\" of devotions to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary.Roman Catholic worship: Trent to today by James F. White 2003 page 34 Saint Jacinta Marto, 1917. In the 18th and 19th centuries, northern and central France became fertile ground for the growth of devotions to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Louis Grignion de Montfort was a fervent preacher.In Prayer With Mary the Mother of Jesus by Jean Lafrance 1988 page 310 In 1830 in Paris, Saint Catherine Labour√© reported a vision in which she saw the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Heart of Jesus thorn-crowned and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword. The devotions, and the associated prayers, continued into the 20th century. The Immaculata prayer by Saint Maximillian Kolbe builds on the Montfortean theme of \\"Jesus through Mary\\". It ends as follows: \\"For wherever You enter You obtain the grace of conversion and growth in holiness, since it is through Your hands that all graces come to us from the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Allow me to praise You, O Sacred Virgin, Give me strength against Your enemies. Amen.\\" The three children who reported the messages of Our Lady of F√°tima emphasized the links between the two Hearts and stated that the Heart of Jesus wishes to be honored together with the Heart of Mary.Youngest Prophet by Christopher Rengers 1998 page 38 In 1920, shortly before her death at age 9, Saint Jacinta Marto, one of the three children of the Our Lady of F√°tima apparitions reportedly discussed the Hearts of Jesus and Mary with a then 12-year-old cousin L√∫cia dos Santos, another one of the three children, and said: > When you are to say this, don't go and hide. Tell everybody that God grants > us graces through the Immaculate Heart of Mary; that people are to ask Her > for them; and that the Heart of Jesus wants the Immaculate Heart of Mary to > be venerated at His side. Tell them also to pray to the Immaculate Heart of > Mary for peace, since God entrusted it to Her. L√∫cia dos Santos later became a nun called Sister L√∫cia of Jesus and of the Immaculate Heart.Saint Companions for Each Day by A. J. M. & J. K. Mousolfe 2002 pages 74-75 Popes Southampton, NY Throughout the centuries, the Catholic Church and several popes have supported the individual devotions to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, as well as the joint devotion. Even before the beginning of private revelations of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, John Eudes had obtained from the ecclesiastical authorities permission to celebrate the Feast of the Heart of Mary in 1648. In 1765, devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was formally approved. In 1799 Pope Pius VI permitted a Feast of the Heart of Mary in Palermo, Sicily and in 1805 Pope Pius VII extended it throughout the world. In 1855, an Office and Mass in honor of the Most Pure Heart of Mary was permitted for the universal Church. Pope Pius IX extended the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus to the entire Catholic Church in 1858. Pope Pius XII instituted the Feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the universal Church in 1945. In the 1956 encyclical Haurietis aquas, he stated: \\"In order that favors in great abundance may flow on all Christians, nay, on the whole human race, from the devotion to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus, let the faithful see to it that to this devotion the Immaculate Heart of the Mother of God is closely joined.\\"Haurietis aquas on the Vatican web site In the 1979 encyclical Redemptor hominis (item 22), Pope John Paul II explained the theme of unity of Mary's Immaculate Heart with the Sacred Heart.: \\"We can say that the mystery of the Redemption took shape beneath the heart of the Virgin of Nazareth when she pronounced her \\"fiat\\". From then on, under the special influence of the Holy Spirit, this heart, the heart of both a virgin and a mother, has always followed the work of her Son and has gone out to all those whom Christ has embraced and continues to embrace with inexhaustible love.\\"Redemptor hominis at the Vatican web site Pope John Paul II stated that: \\"devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary has been an important part of the sensus fidei of the People of God\\". In his Angelus address on September 15, 1985, Pope John Paul II coined the term The Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at F√°tima, Portugal.Pope John Paul II 1986 Speech at the Vatican WebsiteVatican website: Pope John Paul II Angelus address of September 15, 1985 (Spanish and Italian) He often invoked the Sacred and Immaculate Hearts together and at the beginning of the 21st century encouraged all nations to \\"consecrate themselves to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary\\".Pope John Paul II: Jubilee in the World: 2000 at the Vatican WebsiteArthur Calkins, The Alliance of the Two Hearts and Consecration, Miles Immaculatae XXXI (July/December 1995) 389-407.

The team's principal sponsor is a Danish global healthcare company, Novo Nordisk. The team is also sponsored by bicycle maker Colnago.http://www.teamnovonordisk.com/colnago-partnership-announcement/  Pro Cycling Team  Team Novo Nordisk is the first professional cycling team to be comprised completely of riders living with type 1 diabetes.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/team-novo-nordisk-worlds- first-120000732.html All riders and several of the team's staff, including Phil Southerland and VP of Marketing Matt Vogel, are living with diabetes.  Elite Program  In addition to the world's first all-diabetes pro cycling team, Team Novo Nordisk is home to a program of endurance athletes living with diabetes. Women's Team The Team Novo Nordisk Women's Team includes an international mix of national, collegiate and USA circuit champions, Olympic hopefuls and riders of all levels competing in top criteriums, road and track events. Mountain Bike/Cyclocross The Team Novo Nordisk Mountain Bike/Cyclocross Team competes in mountain bike events such as, downhill, cross country and endurance, as well as cyclocross events throughout the U.S. Running/Triathlon Team Novo Nordisk runners include Marathoners, Ultra runners and Olympic hopefuls. The triathletes compete in events such as France's Long Course World Championships and the Ironman World Championship in Kona. Type 2 All members of the Team Novo Nordisk T2 Team are living with type 2 diabetes. The T2 athletes utilize cycling and running, along with proper diet and diabetes management, as a means of staying healthy and active. The athletes range in age from early 30s to over 70. History Team support car in 2019 Tour of Slovenia 2005 In 2005, Phil Southerland and Joe Eldridge founded the team, then known as Team Type 1, to provide inspiration for people living with diabetes and \\"an opportunity to compete at the sport's highest levels\\". 2006‚Äì07 In 2006, Phil Southerland and Joe Eldridge assembled a group of eight cyclists with type 1 diabetes to take on the grueling 3,000 mile Race Across America to raise diabetes awareness. The team went on to win the event in 2007, 2009 and 2010 and quickly became a magnet for endurance athletes with diabetes. 2008 Team Novo Nordisk turned professional in 2008 after success in amateur races. In 2010 it had a UCI Continental licence but became a Professional Continental team in 2011, with a view to competing in the Giro d'Italia in 2011 and the Tour de France in 2012. The team had originally aimed to achieve the Professional Contintental level for the 2010 season but decided against applying for an upgraded licence because of fears that it might preclude the team from competing in events outside the responsibility of the International Cycling Union and a lack of knowledge by the team's management of the scale of investment that would be required to compete at the higher level. 2009 In 2009, Team Novo Nordisk won the Race Across America, having entered a team of cyclists who all had type 1 diabetes. The team has also competed in a number of major professional events, such as the Tour of California and the Tour de Langkawi, and picked up two stage wins in the 2010 Tour du Maroc. 2010 Team Novo Nordisk has competed in a number of major professional events, such as the Tour of California and the Tour de Langkawi and picked up two stage wins in the 2010 Tour du Maroc. In 2010, the team's calendar featured a number of international races, including the Tour de Bretagne Cycliste, the Tour de Taiwan, the Tour of Ireland and the Tour of Japan. The team's main goal for the 2010 season was the Tour of California, an eight-stage race held in May in which Thomas Rabou won the King of the Mountains competition. 2011‚Äì12 Team Novo Nordisk expanded for the 2011 season, its first as a Professional Continental team, 2013 List of UCI Professional Continental and Continental teams, with signings including former Tour de France yellow jersey-wearer Rubens Bertogliati and Russian Alexander Efimkin, who went on to win the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey in May. The team unsuccessfully sought a wildcard entry to the 2011 Giro d'Italia. 2013 In 2013, Team Novo Nordisk became the first-ever professional cycling team to feature an all-diabetes roster. The team continued to race on the International Cycling Union (UCI) Professional Continental tour, and competed in major professional races, including the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, Tour de Beauce, Post Danmark Rundt (Tour of Denmark) and USA Pro Cycling Challenge. 2014 In January 2014, the Pro Men's team began its second season as Team Novo Nordisk in Argentina's Tour de San Luis, and raced over 150 days throughout the year. The team showed marked improvement in its second season, earning top ten finishes at Amgen Tour of California and USA Pro Challenge. 2015 In February 2015, Team Novo Nordisk earned its first-ever win with New Zealander Scott Ambrose taking stage 2 of Le Tour de Filipinas, and the team made its debut at Dubai Tour, earning two top tens at the race.

Also known as refuge chamber, refuge bay, or refuge alternative. Refuge chambers come in all types and models; suitable for a range of different industries including metalliferous mining, coal, tunnelling and petrochemical facilities. In emergencies, when evacuation is no-longer safe or practical, the rescue chamber is designed to provide a safe and secure ‚Äògo-to‚Äô area for personnel to gather and await extraction. Essentially, rescue chambers are sealed environments built to sustain life in an emergency or hazardous event such as a truck fire or toxic gas release. They provide a secure area with shelter, water, and breathable air, for people to remain until they are rescued or the hazard subsides. Refuge chambers need to be sealed to prevent the ingress of toxins such as smoke contaminating the breathable air within the chamber. The sealed area has a closed circuit breathing apparatus; where carbon dioxide and other toxins are removed, oxygen is added, and temperature and humidity are maintained, all while protecting occupants from the external threat. The capacity and duration can vary depending on the chamber build. Communication equipment is also available. The chambers are required to be located in close proximity to worker areas.Guarino, Mark (2010), Could rescue chambers have saved West Virginia miners?, The Christian Science Monitor  Hard Rock Mine Refuge Chamber  Guidelines and Legislation for Rescue Chambers in Hard Rock Mines Some examples of refuge chamber legislation can be view below: * Government of Western Australia, Department of Mines and Petroleum, 2013, ‚ÄúRefuge Chambers In Underground Mines ‚ÄìGuideline‚Äù http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/Safety/Refuge-chambers-in-underground-7896.aspx * Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile/ BCN, 2013, ‚ÄúAprueba Reglamento De Seguridad Minera‚Äù https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=221064&r;=1 * Workplace Safety North, Mines & Aggregates Safety & Health Association, 1998, ‚ÄúGuidelines for Mine Rescue Refuge Stations‚Äù https://www.workplacesafetynorth.ca/sites/default/files/Guidelines%20for%20Mine%20Rescue%20Refuge%20Stations.pdf * Ministry of Labor and Social Security, 2017, Refuge Chambers Installed In Underground Mine Workplaces http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr  Coal Mine Refuge Chamber  The rescue chambers in a typical coal mine provide 96 hours of air, food and water.

The DLDI Patch fixes this, as explained below. Without DLDI, libfat receives encrypted commands from the flashcart, and cannot act accordingly, so it sends an error to the homebrew explaining that it cannot understand the commands, which then presents this information to the flashcart, and the user, in the form of a black screen. With the correct DLDI patch applied to the homebrew,http://hive.ndshb.com/ the DLDI patch acts as an interface between the flashcart/user and the homebrew. It unencrypts the flashcart's specific read/write commands and converts them into a libfat-specific programming language, which libfat can understand and present the homebrew with information which can then be passed onto the flashcart/user.

He was killed in Sumatra while taking part in a diplomatic mission there on behalf of the Portuguese Empire. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1900 as Blessed Denis of the Nativity, O.C.D. (also Dionysius). Life Berthelot was born in Honfleur, in the Calvados Department of Normandy, the second son of Pierre Berthelot, a ship's captain and master surgeon, and Fleurie (n√©e Morin).Gu√©nin, p. 250 His contemporaries described him as \\"a handsome, stocky man, blond and fair-skinned, an adventuresome and high-spirited person, with an inquisitive and active mind\\". The younger Berthelot's first sea voyage was at the age of twelve, and when he was 19 years old, he embarked on a vessel called L'Esp√©rance, bound for the Far East. The ship was captured by a Dutch vessel in competition for the spice trade. It was at this time that Berthelot made a religious conversion. He managed to escape and sought refuge with the Portuguese in Malacca. In service with the Portuguese, Berthelot was knighted for bravery and earned an appointment as pilot-in-chief and cosmographer to the king of Portugal. He gained some fame as a cartographer, and his map of the archipelago of Sumatra is still preserved in the British Museum.Rohrbach Though a career with the Portuguese navy was available to him, he chose to join the Discalced Carmelite Order in Goa in 1635, taking the name of Denis of the Nativity.Gu√©nin, p. 251 He was ordained on 24 August 1638, and straightaway was sent by his superiors on a diplomatic mission to the Sultan of Aceh, accompanying Francisco de Sousa de Castro, an ambassador of the Viceroy in Goa. Castro had requested his presence, both for spiritual guidance for the group as well as for Father Denis' piloting skills and his knowledge of the region from his service aboard the L'Esp√©rance. Once in Aceh, all the members of the mission were seized and arrested, at the instigation of the Dutch authorities in Jakarta. The members of the mission were then tortured. Refusing to deny their faith, they were martyred one by one. Father Denis and his companion, Brother Redemptus of the Cross, were led to a desolate spot on the seashore, where Redemptus was shot with arrows, then his throat was slit Father Denis, a crucifix in his hands, received a fatal blow to the head from a scimitar. Of the sixty-some members of the diplomatic mission, only Castro, the ambassador, survived. He was held captive for three years, until his family paid a large ransom for his life. Veneration Denis of the Nativity was beatified on 10 June 1900 by Pope Leo XIII, together with his companion, Redemptus of the Cross. Their feast day in the Calendar of Saints of the Order is celebrated on the 29 November.

It is known from the Early Permian Tambach Formation (the lowermost unit of the Upper Rotliegend) near the town of Tambach-Dietharz in Thuringia, Germany. Tambachia is the first trematopid to have been discovered outside the United States. Discovery The holotype specimen of Tambachia trogallas, known as MNG 7722, has been found from an outcrop of the Tambach Formation at the Bromacker locality in the Thuringian Forest of central Germany. It consists of a skull and much of the postcranial skeleton. The only major portion of the skeleton that is missing is the presacral vertebral column. The Bromacker locality is a sandstone quarry that is well known for tetrapod trackways and articulated skeletons of terrestrial and semiterrestrial amphibians and reptiles. MNG 7722 was found in red-bed fluvial deposits consisting of well consolidated mudstones in flat-bedded channel fills. Although it is difficult to determine the maturity of MNG 7722, it is thought to be an early adult. Poor ossification of the carpals, tarsals, and endochondral portion of the braincase suggest that MNG 7722 represents an early stage of development, while the pitted skull roof, with tightly closed sutures between bones, indicates a mature individual. The name Tambachia refers to the Tambach Formation. The specific name of T. trogallas is derived from the Greek trogo, meaning munch or nibble, and allas, meaning sausage. The name refers to the Thuringian bratwurst that was frequently eaten in the Bromacker Quarry by the authors who described the species. Description The skull of MNG 7722 is severely crushed dorsoventrally, making it hard to determine the shape of the skull in lateral view. It is in length, which is small for a trematopid. The orbits, or eye sockets, are centrally placed so that the preorbital length of the skull is equal to that of the postorbital length. They make up around 30% of the skull length. The skull table seems to extend posteriorly past the level of the jaw articulation in Tambachia, which is unique among trematopids. However, this is likely to have been the result of crushing of the skull, which displaced the skull table. Tambachia, like other trematopids, likely possessed a salt gland similar to those seen in modern reptiles. The subdivision of the external naris into anterior and posterior portions is evidence of the presence of salt glands. The anterior portion is sub-circular and is thought to be the true narial opening. The posterior portion likely held the salt gland. The expansion of the posterior portion may not be an accommodation for the salt gland, but rather a means of coping with cranial stresses during feeding. The postcranial skeleton is well known in Tambachia, given the completeness of the holotype specimen. The relatively short tail, preserved only as a faint impression in MNG 7722, is long. The limbs are short, with four digits on the manus, or hand, and five digits on the pes, or foot. It is possible that the manus possessed five digits, since Acheloma, another closely related trematopid, has been described as having five distal carpals. In the pes of the holotype specimen, there are only four digits preserved. However, since the third preserved digit is the longest, it likely represents the fourth digit, with the first digit absent due to imperfect preservation. The terminal phalanges of Tambachia were narrow, and would have been the core supports of claws. Classification In the original description of Tambachia, Sumida et al. (1998) concluded that Anconastes was the closest relative of Tambachia. Characteristics that supported this relationship included the absence of an internarial fenestra (which is also seen in dissorophids, but was interpreted as a convergent trait), the reduction of the suborbital process of the lacrimal, and a contribution to the ventral orbital rim (the rim of the eye socket) by the maxilla rather than the palatine. Below is a cladogram modified from Sumida et al. (1998) showing the proposed relationships of Tambachia and other trematopids: In their description of Fedexia, Berman et al. (2010) placed Fedexia as the sister taxon of the clade containing Tambachia and Anconastes. Tambachia, Anconastes, and Fedexia all possess a shallow and broadly concave occipital margin. In other trematopids, the margin is biconcave. Below is a cladogram modified from Berman et al.

He was a meteorologist at the Ishigaki Weather Station, Ishigaki, Okinawa Prefecture. Initially, when weather forecasting was in its infancy, he had been badly criticized by local people when his forecast of a typhoon was incorrect. Nevertheless, his work as a meteorologist was better understood by locals later in his career, which endeared him to people. Other names Takuji was also known as Á≥∏Êï∞Âéü‰∏ª‰∫∫Ë¢ãÈ¢®Ëçò‰∏ª‰∫∫,Ëù∂‰ªô„ÄÅËù∂ÁøÅ. He was also called \\"Â§©ÊñáÂ±ã„ÅÆÂæ°‰∏ªÂâç\\" (tenbunyah no ushumai), meaning master of the weather observatory, or \\"nahbera no ushumai\\" (literal: master of sponge cucumber). Life Takuji was born on October 17, 1869, to a family of samurai in Sendai, a city in the Miyagi Prefecture. He discontinued high school and became a trainee at the Central Meteorological Station (now the Japan Meteorological Agency). He also worked at the weather stations of Nemuro and Sapporo. Takuji was stationed at the Ishigaki Weather Observatory (now Ishigaki Weather Station) in the Yaeyama Islands 1899 when he married. In 1900, he became the second director of the observatory, and had remained in Ishigaki until his death. While he was stationed at the observatory in Ishigaki, Takuji studied various unrelated fields including society, traditions, and natural sciences related to Ishigaki. He became the director of Yaeyama Library, which later became the Yaeyama branch of the Okinawa Prefectural Library. He started the first kindergarten on the island, and took part in a venture enterprise of culturing black pearls in Kabira Bay with Mikimoto K≈çkichi. One of Takuji's weaknesses was language. He only spoke a Sendai dialect, and up until his death, conversation with local people was very difficult. In 1932, Takuji retired from the Ishigaki Observatory but remained as a part-time worker. Then living in Tonoshiro, Ishigaki, he named his house \\"Fukurokaze Soh\\". He died there on May 2, 1937, at the age of 69. In 2001, Takuji was made an honorary citizen of Ishigaki. Achievements Takuji proposed that all buildings in typhoon-prone Ishigaki Island be built in concrete, including his observatory. This became a reality in 1915, and now almost all buildings in Ishigaki are erected in concrete. He observed every typhoon which hit Ishigaki Island, and during one storm in 1914, a small stone hit his right eye and he lost his sight in that eye. Takuji has been famous for his studies in the fields of biology. With the help of scholars such as Yasushi Nawa and Matsutoshi Matsumura, many new species were discovered, including several species called Iwasaki in Japanese. As for insects, Takuji discovered and named Iwasaki Ootoge Kamemushi, Iwasaki Kamemushi, Iwasaki Kusazemi, Iwasaki Kinsuji Kamikiri, Iwasaki Konoha, Iwasaki Shirocho, Iwasaki Zemi, Iwasaki Himeharuzemi, Iwasaki Herikamemushi, and Iwasaki Kusazemi. He also bred butterflies such as \\"Oogomadara\\" and Konoha Cho, and observed their behaviour. The Japanese name \\"Oogomadara\\" means \\"paper kite\\" or the \\"rice paper butterfly\\", Idea leuconoe, and is known especially for its presence in butterfly greenhouses and live butterfly expositions. The paper kite butterfly has its origins in Southeast Asia. Snakes named in honor of Takuji include Iwasaki Sedaka Hebi (Pareas iwasakii )Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Iwasaki\\", p. 131). and Iwasaki Wamon Beni Hebi (Calliophis macclellandi iwasakii ). He bred the poisonous Sakishima habu (Trimeresurus elegans) and devised ways to cope with the snake. Takuji had collected a number of folklore and local songs, and tried to introduce the culture of Ishigaki Island through Yanagita Kunio and Orikuchi Shinobu.

One third of the council was up for election and the Liberal Democrats gained overall control of the council from the Labour party. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrat 31 *Labour 25 *Conservative 2 *Green 2 Campaign Before the election Labour ran the council with 32 seats compared to 25 for the Liberal Democrats who were the main opposition party on the council. However the 1999 election had seen the Liberal Democrats win more votes than Labour, 42.5% compared to 38%, and they were confident of at least depriving Labour of a majority on the council in the election. Issues in the election included crime, education, employment, health and litter. Unemployment was down at around 5%, but still above the national average and was much higher in some of the inner city areas. In the week before the election Labour suffered a blow when a councillor, Margaret Kelly, defected to the Green party. She had been a Labour member for 30 years, but said that the national Labour government was not what she had fought for in opposition. Election result The results saw the Liberal Democrats gain control of the council from the Labour party. Labour, who had run the council for the previous 20 years, suffered a number of losses including the council leader John Battye in Failsworth East ward. Battye, who had been leader of the council for the previous 15 years, was defeated by 1,605 votes by a 23-year- old Liberal Democrat candidate Charles Glover in the most high-profile contest in the election. The swing to the Liberal Democrats was over 8% since 1996, enabling them to gain control of the council for the first time. They now had an overall majority of 2, after they gained seats in Coldhurst, Hollinwood, Royton North and Royton South in addition to Failsworth East. The Liberal Democrats also regained a seat in Crompton, where the independent Liberal Democrat councillor, Michael Hambley, stood down at the election. Meanwhile, the Conservatives doubled the number of seats they held on the council to 2, after gaining a seat in Chadderton North from Labour. The national Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy described the results in Oldham as a \\"fantastic result, showing the inroads that Liberal Democrats were making into Labour's heartlands\\". However the local Labour Member of Parliament Phil Woolas said that the election was down to local issues and had \\"nothing to do with the national political situation\\". Following the election there were allegations of vote rigging in the election. After a police investigation, 11 people were convicted of election fraud in July 2001. They were convicted after police found evidence of voters using dead people's names to vote and impersonating other voters. The offences had taken place in the wards of the Coldhurst, St Mary's and Werneth and those convicted were both Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters. Another defendant, Liberal Democrat councillor Mohib Uddin, who had been elected in Coldhurst, was acquitted.

Following the Fourth Crusade, he established himself as an independent ruler before submitting to the Empire of Nicaea. Older historians, such as George Finlay and William Miller had identified his city with Amisos or Samsun on the Black Sea coast, and thought Sabas had his base there; however in a 1935 article, G. de Jerphanion proved that his center of power was Sampson on the coast of the Aegean Sea.A. A. Vasiliev, \\"The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1222)\\", Speculum, 11 (1936), p. 24 Biography The origin of Asidenos is unknown. In 1204, like other powerful magnates (e.g. Theodore Mangaphas or Leo Sgouros), he used the power vacuum created by the fall of the Byzantine imperial capital of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade, to seize control of Sampson and the lower valley of the Maeander River... In late 1205 or early 1206, however, he was forced to recognize the sovereignty of the major Anatolian Byzantine successor realm, the Empire of Nicaea headed by Theodore I Laskaris (r. 1204‚Äì1222). Asidenos submitted peacefully and maintained his local influence, possibly acting as the region's governor. His relations with the Nicaean ruler became close, and Asidenos apparently married into the Laskarid dynasty, for in 1214 he is addressed by Theodore I as sympetheros (\\"relative-in-law\\"), and he is recorded as holding the title of sebastokrator, at the time usually restricted to the Byzantine emperor's brothers. Asidenos is mentioned again in 1216, in a document from a monastery in Mount Latmos. Nothing is known of him thereafter.

The firm was founded in 2005 and invests in fixed income, energy, quantitative and event- driven strategies. The firm was actively involved in the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market during the 2006‚Äì2007 period. In some articles critical of Magnetar Capital, the firm's arbitrage strategy for CDOs is described as the \\"Magnetar trade\\".The Magnetar Trade: How One Hedge Fund Helped Keep the Bubble Going , by Jesse Eisinger and Jake Bernstein, ProPublica, April 9, 2010 The company has additional offices in New York City, London, England, Houston, Texas, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2006‚Äì2007, Magnetar Capital \\"facilitated the creation of a few of the worst-performing collateralized debt obligations\\", many named after stars or constellations. While the CDOs Magnetar Capital helped create led to losses on Wall Street, the company profited as a result of its hedged investment strategy; Magnetar Capital had protected itself against losses on CDOs by purchasing credit default swaps. As of 2010, 23 of the CDOs Magnetar Capital invested in had become \\"nearly worthless\\". \\"The Inside Job. Act One: Eat My Shorts\\" (Episode 405), This American Life. (2010-04-09), Alex Blumberg, Jake Bernstein, Jesse EisingerThe \\"nearly worthless\\" comment is at 36:40 into the This American Life \\"Inside Job\\" audio story Despite investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into several deals in which Magnetar Capital invested, there was no enforcement action filed against the firm.  History  Magnetar Capital was founded in 2005 by Alec Litowitz (formerly of Citadel LLC) and Ross Laser (formerly of Glenwood Capital Partners). Based in Evanston, Illinois, the firm started with $1.8 billion in capital, making it one of the largest hedge fund launches at the time. Early on, Magnetar Capital's multi-strategy fund invested in event-driven investments and the firm doubled in size to nearly $4 billion by the end of 2006. The firm launched into other areas, among them private investments in public equity, reinsurance, and traditional asset management, but turned its focus to fixed income. In 2005, Magnetar began investing in the North American energy sector.  2006‚Äì2007 involvement with CDOs  Magnetar Capital was actively involved in the collateralized debt obligation markets during the 2006‚Äì2007 period, when it invested in the equity of about $30 billion worth of CDOs. As a proposed means to hedge CDO investments, Goldman Sachs sent Magnetar Capital marketing information regarding \\"short bets\\" against the housing market via an asset-backed securities index (ABX). Banks Bundled Bad Debt, Bet Against It and Won by Gretchen Morgenson and Louise Story, 23 December 2009, New York Times Partner David Snyderman told Derivatives Week at the time that Magnetar Capital was \\"excited about the opportunities in the mortgage derivatives market\\". CDO investments are divided into risk-based tranches: the highest risk slices offer the highest yield, whereas the safer pieces have lower yields. With what some observers have referred to as the \\"Magnetar Trade\\", Magnetar Capital took long positions in the highest risk slices of synthetic collateralized debt obligations and hedged those positions by placing short bets on safer slices called mezzanine tranches via credit default swaps, which act similarly to an insurance policy. This allowed Magnetar Capital to receive payments while the housing market ran smoothly and hedged its downside risk. As a result, it lost money on the riskiest slices it bought, but made much more from the hedges when the market collapsed in 2007. According to mortgage analysts, Magnetar Capital would have benefitted from its Magnetar Trade regardless of whether the subprime market collapsed. ProPublicas coverage of the CDO industry, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2011, made a number of allegations regarding Magnetar Capital's CDO investments, including that Magnetar Capital's trades in the CDO market helped worsen the financial crisis by helping to structure CDOs the company was planning to short (bet against). Other claims made by the ProPublica series include: Magnetar Capital tried to influence CDO managers to buy riskier bonds to increase the likelihood of those CDOs failing; CDOs that Magnetar Capital invested in \\"defaulted\\" at a much higher rate than similar CDOs; and the CDO market would have \\"cooled off\\" in late 2005 had Magnetar Capital not entered the market, resulting in a less severe financial crisis. ProPublica did note that in its view, while Magnetar Capital's CDOs might have prolonged and exacerbated the financial crisis, the firm did not cause the crisis or the housing bubble. Janet Tavakoli, a financial industry consultant, wrote in her 2008 book, \\"Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations\\", that Magnetar Capital's Constellation CDOs \\"seemed designed to fail\\".Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations, Second Edition, Janet Tavakoli, publisher John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2008, Constellation CDOs: pgs 413-415 Contrary to the allegations, Magnetar Capital maintains that it did not control asset selection for the CDOs in which it invested and that the firm did not place an overall bet against the housing market. The firm said its investments were market neutral and would have made money whether the housing market went up or down. According to the Financial Times, \\"Magnetar argues that it was not shorting the subprime market but was arbitraging between different layers of CDOs, taking advantage of the fact that it could get a yield of 20 per cent on the equity and then hedge that by shorting the mezzanine layers\\".  2010 lawsuits  In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against JP Morgan Chase for a deal in 2007 that involved securities picked by Magnetar Capital. JP Morgan settled the lawsuit for $153.6 million in 2011. Separately, in 2012, The Wall Street Journal reported that the government sought to see if Magnetar \\"had such a strong influence in designing any of the deals that in effect it took over the role of collateral manager\\".The Magnetar Fallout: Who‚Äôs Been Charged, Has Settled, or is Now Being Investigated? by Cora Currier, ProPublica, July 19, 2012 Particularly, the regulator spent more than a year examining whether Magnetar Capital had any influence over asset selection of a $1.5 billion CDO created by Merrill Lynch called Norma CDO I, but the SEC took no action against the firm. In 2010, Intesa Sanpaolo named Magnetar Capital, and others, in its lawsuit against Credit Agricole, alleging fraud related to the CDO Pyxis ABS CDO 2006-1. The suit alleged that a Credit Agricole unit concealed Magnetar's role in the collateralized debt obligation. The case was dismissed, as the court ruled Intesa failed to file the suit in a timely manner.  Parody Prize  In 2010, Magnetar Capital‚Äôs directors, among others, won the Ig Nobel Prize in Economics for \\"creating and promoting new ways to invest money‚Äîways that maximize financial gain and minimize financial risk for the world economy, or for a portion thereof.\\"  Diversification into other asset classes  Following the financial crisis, the firm pivoted into quantitative trading and exploring new investments, including films, commercial jets, and real estate. In January 2013, the firm became the largest homeowner in Huber Heights, Ohio, by buying a portfolio of almost 2,000 rental homes from the family of the town's original developer. It rents these homes as part of its investment strategy. Magnetar Capital also invests in European real estate. The firm entered the film financing business in 2013, when it provided most of the funding for a $400 million co-financing deal that provided 20th Century Fox with money to fund a slate of films over a five-year period. In 2014, Magnetar Capital introduced two new energy funds, Magnetar Solar Holdings and Magnetar Solar Opportunities Fund. Magnetar Solar (UK) owned 25 solar farms with approximately 300 megawatts of generation capacity. In 2016, Magnetar Capital owned about 344 megawatts of the UK's solar production. The firm sold its UK solar portfolio to Rockfire Capital in 2018.  Mergers and acquisitions  The New York City-based Blackstone Group's hedge fund unit, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, through its Strategic Capital Holdings Fund, bought a minority stake of Magnetar in 2015. Financials of the deal were not disclosed; Magnetar said the deal would help it expand, and management remained in place following the deal. Magnetar Capital bought a majority stake in auto lender First Citizen, of Dublin, Ireland, in 2017. As of 2018, energy continues to be an investment interest of the company, including a stake in Double Eagle Energy Holdings III Permian in Texas.

Jos√© Mar√≠a Sobral, who is considered in Argentina the father of the Argentine Antarctica and a national hero, began exploration at the end of 1901. In 1903, the Argentine Navy corvette ARA Uruguay commanded by Captain de Corbeta (Lieutenant commander) Juli√°n Ir√≠zar successfully rescued the Swedish expedition team of Otto Nordenskj√∂ld. In 1904 the Argentine permanent presence in Antarctica began with the opening of Orcadas Base on Laurie Island. Argentina was the only nation to have an Antarctic base for 40 years until the British built a base on the same islands. On April 1, 1940, the first radio communication by radio hams was made between Orcadas Base (LSX) and Buenos Aires (LU 7 ET). On February 7, 1942, an amphibious Stearman aircraft embarked on the ARA 1 de Mayo cargo ship made the first Argentine flight over Antarctica. On December 13, 1947 an Argentine Naval Aviation Douglas DC-4 piloted by Comodoro Gregorio Portillo flew over the Antarctic Circle in a 15 hours and 30 minutes flight. IAA On 17 April 1951, Hern√°n Pujato founds the Instituto Antartico Argentino, by Decree N¬∫ 7338. In 1953 the San Mart√≠n Base started operations, and Jubany base opened two years later. In 1958 the United States handed over the Ellsworth Station located in the Weddell Sea. In 1965 the Argentine military conducted a land military manoeuvre known as Operaci√≥n 90 in order to reach the South Pole. In the winter of 1968 at the request by the British embassy in Buenos Aires, an Argentine Navy Douglas DC-4 successfully delivered medical supplies to the British base EFE where one of its members, James K. Portwirie, was through a medical emergency. However, after a few days, Portwirie's situation worsened, making a rescue necessary. An Argentine Air Force aircraft attempted to reach the base but crashed without casualties. On August 9, in the middle of the Antarctic winter, the Argentine Navy icebreaker ARA General San Mart√≠n was sent to rescue Portwirie. The operation was successful, gaining the thanks of the British Antarctic Survey: ‚Äò‚Äòan internal campaign like this was never attempted before in Antarctic History‚Äò‚Äò..

It is famous as a gathering place for a generation of influential New York photographers, including W. Eugene Smith, Arthur Tress, Mary Ellen Mark, Les Krims, Judy Dater, Lisette Model and Lee Witkin. It was also one of the first institutions to engage in teaching photography in socially marginalized communities such as prisons, mental institutions and drug rehabilitation programs. The Foundation was founded by photographer Maggie Sherwood in 1970 after she bought an old houseboat, painted it purple and offered it as a gallery and photo center for many of her friends. Within a few years she added a classroom and darkrooms. The houseboat was originally moored at the 79th Street Boat Basin, but in later years it traveled up and down the Hudson River. Photography critic A. D. Coleman described it as \\"moored at the literal edge of Manahattan, marginal by definition, it served a key role as the medium of photography itself moved from the periphery to the center of cultural discourse and creative activity.\\" The Foundation continued to be an influential center for photography in New York until two years after Sherwood's death in 1984. In 2009 the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art at the State University of New York at New Paltz mounted a retrospective exhibition about the Floating Foundation, its influences and the photographers who were part of what happened there. The catalog of the exhibition, Taking a Different Tack: Maggie Sherwood and the Floating Foundation of Photography , includes many images of the photographers who met there and the houseboat itself.

It was actually located on a narrow finger-shaped peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides, that jutted into Lake Hopatcong. The park began as a bathing beach and soon started adding amusements in the 1910s when a connection was constructed via a trolley by the Morris County Traction Company. Later, during the 1920s, it was expanded by the owner, Louis Kraus, and ultimately included some 20 rides including a wooden roller coaster, an airplane swing, bumper cars, picnic areas, a Skee-Ball arcade, dance hall, and a cafeteria. It was located on the beach, and had a diving tower and boat docks. Its carousel for many years was a famous Illions Monarch II Supreme which was later sold to Circus World in Florida. Bertrand Island Amusement Park operated for over 70 years, but finally was closed in 1983, due to the competition from larger theme parks and Lake Hopatcong's evolution to an all-year-round community. In 2001, the area was developed into townhouses.[1] A narrated history of Bertrand Island Park with video footage and many photographs was completed by the Lake Hopatcong Historical Museum.

Initially the two Pullman cars were hauled by mules but in 1881 the Sultan ordered an 0-4-0 tank locomotive from the English locomotive builders Bagnall. The railway saw service until the Sultan died in 1888 when the track and locomotive were scrapped. Fifteen years later (In 1905) the American Company Arnold Cheyney built a seven-mile line from Zanzibar Town to the village of Bububu. It was notorious for its ability to set fire to property and the surrounding countryside but it ran for twenty-five years until it closed in 1930. The Bububu Railway plied six or seven times a day to Zanzibar Town. The service was extremely popular and largely used by the native population. A special first-class coach was run for the benefit of those passengers from steamers who wish to obtain a glimpse of the island. The railway traversed some of the narrowest streets of the city, and it was a constant source of wonderment how passers-by escaped being run over. Europeans resident in Zanzibar regard the railway with an amused tolerance.http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/781 During the railway construction the Americans undertook the task of installing electrical power lines along the track. Wherever the rails were placed, metal poles were installed and power lines strung overhead. By 1906, long before even London obtained them, Stone Town had electric street lights. In 1911, the railway was sold to the Government, and by 1922 the passenger service ceased. As roads improved and motor vehicles on the island increased, its popularity diminished. With the improvement of the port the railway was used for the haulage of stone which was used to reclaim the seafront. Today much of the old track bed has been built on however train enthusiasts can still see the remains of the railway‚Äôs bridges and embankments close to the main road to Bububu.

From 1950 until his death he was director of the Rabbinical Seminary in Budapest.  Biography  Scheiber was born in Budapest into a rabbinical family on both his maternal and paternal sides. He was ordained at the Seminary in 1938 as a student of Bern√°t Heller. After studies in London, Oxford and Cambridge, where he discovered many genizah fragments while analyzing medieval Hebrew manuscripts, he served as rabbi in Dunaf√∂ldv√°r from 1941 to 1944. In 1945, he became a professor at the rabbinical seminary and was its director from 1950 until his death. This institution retained its international fame throughout the Communist era, when it was the only place in the Eastern bloc where rabbis would be graduated for serving in Hungary and abroad. Furthermore, Scheiber joined the faculty of the University of Szeged in 1949, teaching oriental folklore. He considered it his mission to explore the Hungarian Jewish past and perpetuate its memory, as well as to publish the contributions of great Hungarian-Jewish scholars, including the works of Wilhelm Bacher, Fauna und Mineralien der Juden by Immanuel L√∂w (1969) and the diary (Tagebuch) of Ign√°c Goldziher (1978). In 1957, he published a facsimile of the so-called Kaufmann Haggadah, called after David Kaufmann, MS 422 of the Kaufmann Collection in the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Indonesia. Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia and Oceania, consisting of 17,508 islands. With a population of around 230 million people, it is the world's fourth most populated country. History The Indonesia Post Administration was formally established on 27 September 1945, but the history of Indonesian stamps began on 1 April 1864 with the release of the first Dutch East Indies stamp. The history of Indonesian stamps can be divided into five broad periods: * The Dutch East Josh Twigger * The Japanese Occupation * The War of Independence * The Beginning of Independence * The New Order and present Dutch East Indies First Dutch Indies stamp issued on 1 April 1864 The first postage stamp in the Dutch East Indies was printed in Utrecht, the Netherlands, on 1 April 1864. The stamp showed a picture of King Willem III of the Netherlands and had a face value of ten cents. It was designed by T W Kaiser. Until 1920, stamp designs only showed pictures of the King and Queen and were primarily shown using typographic design. In 1921, a new series known as the and was specially printed to serve as additional postage for sending sea mail in waterproof iron chests. Stamps issued in later years began to show the culture and geography of the Indonesian archipelago. During the Dutch East Indies period, the stamps were printed in the Netherlands by the firm of Joh.

Japanese Occupation A stamp issued during the Japanese occupation, 1943. The Japanese Military Government did not immediately issue new stamps. The quickest solution was to overprint the many remaining Dutch Colonial Stamps. Definitive stamps began to be issued in 1943 and showed a traditional house, a dancer, a temple and a view of rice field. Some were designed by Dick Ruhl, and some by Basuki Abdullah, one of Indonesia‚Äôs most famous painters. War of Independence 1948 Revolutionary series. Dutch East Indies stamps and stamps from the Japanese Occupation were stored in the headquarters of Post Telegraph and Telephone (PTT) and in other post offices. The Stamps continued to be used after they were overprinted with words like \\"Repoeblik Indonesia\\", \\"Rep. Indonesia\\", \\"Rep. Indonesia PTT\\", \\"NRI\\" and \\"RI\\" by Indonesian nationalists. After the proclamation of Indonesia‚Äôs independence, stamp showing a furious bull was issued to commemorate independence in 1946. It was printed in Yogyakarta using a simple technique in one and two colors. Most stamps were printed and overprinted in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Pematangsiantar, Padang, Palembang, and Aceh. Indonesian nationalists, at this time, tried to seek international support and recognition. One such effort got underway in 1948 with the printing of stamps of Revolutionary series by the Staats Druckerei, or State Printer, in Vienna, Austria and by the American E. W. Wright Banknote Co. of Philadelphia, printed using the photoengraving and steel engraving methods.https://web.archive.org/web/20180303060803/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/asia/indonesia/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. Independence  A 1950 stamp marking the inauguration of the United States of Indonesia. Netherlands formally transferred sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies to the United States of Indonesia on 27 December 1949. In 1954, the first modern printer named Pertjetakan Kebajoran opened in Indonesia, entering a chapter of in-country stamp printing. Local designers appeared, such as Amat bin Dupri, Kurnia & Kok and Junalies. During this period, the government ordered the stamp design and production to Pertjetakan Kebajoran. New order 1960 definitive series showing agricultural products. 1962 Asian Games issue. Around the time of its First Five Year Plan, the government issued stamps with many different themes. The general themes drew from national growth and development and related to social activities, art, culture and tourism. These themes can be organized into the following classifications: * Agriculture * Industry * Transportation and Communication * Trade, Cooperation and Business * Worker and Human Rights * Population and Family Planning * Social Welfare * Women, Children and Public Health * Young Generation and Sports * Education and Information * Culture and Tourism * Politics, Law, National Security and Foreign Relations * Rural Development and Environment * Science and Technology * Religion Stamps were printed in PERURI (The Indonesian Government Security Printing and Mint Corp.), a merger of two state companies, PN Pertjetakan Kebajoran and PN Artha Djaja (The State Mint).

While mirages are the best known atmospheric refraction phenomena, looming and similar refraction phenomena do not produce mirages. Mirages show an extra image or images of the miraged object, while looming, towering, stooping, and sinking do not. No inverted image is present in those phenomena either. Depending on atmospheric conditions, the objects can appear to be elevated or lowered, stretched or stooped. These phenomena can occur together, changing the appearance of different parts of the objects in different ways. Sometimes these phenomena can occur together with a true mirage. Looming Looming of the Canadian coast as seen from left Looming is the most noticeable and most often observed of these refraction phenomena. It is an abnormally large refraction of the object that increases the apparent elevation of the distant objects and sometimes allows an observer to see objects that are located below the horizon under normal conditions. One of the most famous looming observations was made by William Latham in 1798, who wrote: Thomas Jefferson noted the phenomenon of looming in his book Notes on the State of Virginia: He was unable to explain this phenomenon and did not think refraction could account from the perceived changes of shape of the object in question. Other famous observations that were called \\"mirages\\" may actually be referring to looming. One of those was described in Scientific American on August 25, 1894 as \\"a remarkable mirage seen by the citizens of Buffalo, New York\\". Such looming‚Äîsometimes with apparent magnification of opposite shores‚Äîhave been reported over the Great Lakes. Canadian shorelines have been observed from Rochester, New York, across Lake Ontario, and from Cleveland across Lake Erie. The landforms over distant, normally beyond the horizon, were sometimes perceived as away. Looming is most commonly seen in the polar regions. Looming was sometimes responsible for the errors made by polar explorers; for example, Charles Wilkes charted the coast of Antarctica, where later only water was found. The larger the size of the sphere (the planet where an observer is located) the less curved the horizon is. William Jackson Humphreys' calculations showed that an observer could see all the way around a planet nearly six times larger in radius than the Earth, with the same atmosphere as the Earth, because of looming. Sinking Sinking is the opposite of looming. In sinking, stationary objects that are normally seen above the horizon appear to be lowered, or may even disappear below the horizon. In looming, the curvature of the rays is increasing, while sinking produces the opposite effect. In general, looming is more noticeable than sinking because objects that appear to grow stand out more than those that appear to shrink. Towering and stooping Towering and stooping are more complex forms of atmospheric refraction than looming and sinking. While looming and sinking change the apparent elevation of an object, towering and stooping change the apparent shape of the object itself. With towering, objects appear stretched; with stooping, objects seem to be shortened. The apparent stretching and shortening of the objects are not symmetrical and depends on the thermal profile of the atmosphere. The curvature of the rays changes more rapidly in some places because the thermal profile is curved. Image example and explanation Fata Morgana of the Farallon Islands These three images were taken from the same place on different days under different atmospheric conditions. The top frame shows looming. The island shape is not distorted, but is elevated. The middle frame shows looming with towering. The lowest frame is a 5-image superior mirage of the islands. The uppermost image is stooped severely. As the image shows, the different refraction phenomena are not independent from each other and may occur together as a combination, depending on atmospheric conditions.

In February 808, a group of secular and ecclesiastic officials, who were dissatisfied with Nikephoros's rule, formed a conspiracy and acclaimed Arsaber as emperor.... Nikephoros, however, discovered the plot and arrested the participants, who were beaten, had their properties confiscated, and were ultimately exiled. Arsaber himself was tonsured and exiled to a monastery in Bithynia. Arsaber's daughter, Theodosia, had been married to the future Emperor Leo V the Armenian (r. 813‚Äì820).

Because rhenium is a rare element, relatively few applications exist, but the area has been a rich source of concepts and a few useful catalysts. General features Re exists in ten known oxidation states from ‚àí3 to +7 except ‚àí2, and all but Re(‚àí3) are represented by organorhenium compounds. Most are prepared from salts of perrhenate and related binary oxides.O. Glemser \\"Ammonium Perrhenate\\" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G.

A noteworthy feature of organorhenium chemistry is the coexistence of oxide and organic ligands in the same coordination sphere. Carbonyl compounds Dirhenium decacarbonyl is a common entry point to other rhenium carbonyls. The general patterns are similar to the related manganese carbonyls. It is possible to reduce this dimer with sodium amalgam to Na[Re(CO)5] with rhenium in the formal oxidation state ‚àí1.

The electron poor 4-trifluoromethylphenylrhenium trioxide (4-CF3C6H4ReO3) is likewise relatively stable. MTO and other organylrhenium trioxides catalyze oxidation reactions with hydrogen peroxide as well as olefin metathesis in the presence of a Lewis acid activator.
