However, the document is now seen as outdated, representing Modernist views opposed to reconstruction. Reconstruction is now cautiously accepted by UNESCO in exceptional circumstances if it seeks to reflect a pattern of use or cultural practice that sustains cultural value, and is based on complete documentation without reliance on conjecture. The change in attitude can be marked by the reconstruction in 2015 of the Sufi mausoleums at the Timbuktu World Heritage Site in Mali after their destruction in 2012.Cameron, ChristinaReconstruction: changing attitudes, UNESCO Historic background=Athens Charter The development of new conservation and restoration techniques have threatened the historic buildings in a general sense. In 1931, the International Museum Office organized a meeting of specialists about the conservation of historic buildings. The conference resulted with the Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments. This consisted of a manifesto of seven points: * to establish organizations for restoration advice * to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism * to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites * to rebury excavations which were not to be restored. * to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work. * to place historical sites under custodial protection. * to protect the area surrounding historic sites. The Athens Charter proposed the idea of a common world heritage, the importance of the setting of monuments, and the principle of the integration of new materials. The Charter had very progressive suggestions for its period, influencing the creation of conservation institutions, as well as the eventual Venice Charter. First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings With the concern that listing and safeguarding historic buildings was not enough, in 1957 architectural specialists arranged a congress in Paris called The First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings. At its conclusion, the congress published seven recommendations: # the countries which still lack a central organization for the protection of historic buildings provide for the establishment of such an authority, # the creation of an international assembly of architects and specialists of historic buildings should be considered, # a specialized professional training of all categories of personnel should be promoted so as to secure highly qualified workmanship and that remuneration should be commensurate with such qualifications, # the hygrometric problems relating to historic buildings should be discussed in a symposium, # contemporary artists should be requested to contribute to the decoration of monuments, # close cooperation should be established among architects and archeologists, # architects and town-planners cooperate so as to secure integration of historic buildings into town planning. The Congress agreed to have its second meeting in Venice and Piero Gazzola, who was to serve as the chairman of the Venice Charter, was invited to hold the Venice Congress. Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings In 1964, at the Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, 13 resolutions were adopted of which the first was the Venice Charter and the second was creation of ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites). The Venice Charter consisted of seven main titles and sixteen articles. The concept of historic monuments and sites was interpreted as the common heritage, therefore safeguarding them for the future generations with authenticity was defined as the common responsibility. The following text is the original 1964 text agreed on by the representatives of the participating nations mentioned at the end of the Charter. Venice Charter Text=Definitions Article 1. The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found the evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a historic event. This applies not only to great works of art but also to more modest works of the past which have acquired cultural significance with the passing of time. Article 2. The conservation and restoration of monuments must have recourse to all the sciences and techniques which can contribute to the study and safeguarding of the architectural heritage. Aim Article 3. The intention in conserving and restoring monuments is to safeguard them no less as works of art than as historical evidence. Conservation Article 4. It is essential to the conservation of monuments that they be maintained on a permanent basis. Article 5. The conservation of monuments is always facilitated by making use of them for some socially useful purpose. Such use is therefore desirable but it must not change the lay-out or decoration of the building. It is within these limits only that modifications demanded by a change of function should be envisaged and may be permitted. Article 6. The conservation of a monument implies preserving a setting which is not out of scale. Wherever the traditional setting exists, it must be kept. No new construction, demolition or modification which would alter the relations of mass and color must be allowed. Article 7. A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance. Article 8. Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed from it if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation. Restoration Article 9. The process of restoration is a highly specialized operation. Its aim is to preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents. It must stop at the point where conjecture begins, and in this case moreover any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and must bear a contemporary stamp. The restoration in any case must be preceded and followed by an archaeological and historical study of the monument. Article 10. Where traditional techniques prove inadequate, the consolidation of a monument can be achieved by the use of any modern technique for conservation and construction, the efficacy of which has been shown by scientific data and proved by experience. Article 11. The valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected, since unity of style is not the aim of a restoration. When a building includes the superimposed work of different periods, the revealing of the underlying state can only be justified in exceptional circumstances and when what is removed is of little interest and the material which is brought to light is of great historical, archaeological or aesthetic value, and its state of preservation good enough to justify the action. Evaluation of the importance of the elements involved and the decision as to what may be destroyed cannot rest solely on the individual in charge of the work. Article 12. Replacements of missing parts must integrate harmoniously with the whole, but at the same time must be distinguishable from the original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic evidence. Article 13. Additions cannot be allowed except in so far as they do not detract from the interesting parts of the building, its traditional setting, the balance of its composition and its relation with its surroundings. Historic Sites Article 14. The sites of monuments must be the object of special care in order to safeguard their integrity and ensure that they are cleared and presented in a seemly manner. The work of conservation and restoration carried out in such places should be inspired by the principles set forth in the foregoing articles. Excavations Article 15. Excavations should be carried out in accordance with scientific standards and the recommendation defining international principles to be applied in the case of archaeological excavation adopted by UNESCO in 1956. Ruins must be maintained and measures necessary for the permanent conservation and protection of architectural features and of objects discovered must be taken. Furthermore, every means must be taken to facilitate the understanding of the monument and to reveal it without ever distorting its meaning. All reconstruction work should however be ruled out \\"a priori.\\" Only anastylosis, that is to say, the reassembling of existing but dismembered parts can be permitted. The material used for integration should always be recognizable and its use should be the least that will ensure the conservation of a monument and the reinstatement of its form. Publication Article 16. In all works of preservation, restoration or excavation, there should always be precise documentation in the form of analytical and critical reports, illustrated with drawings and photographs. Every stage of the work of clearing, consolidation, rearrangement and integration, as well as technical and formal features identified during the course of the work, should be included. This record should be placed in the archives of a public institution and made available to research workers. It is recommended that the report should be published. The Committee The following persons took part in the work of the Committee for drafting the International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments: *Piero Gazzola (Italy), Chairman *Raymond M. Lemaire (Belgium), Reporter *Jose Bassegoda-Nonell (Spain) *Luis Benavente (Portugal) *Djurdje Boskovic (Yugoslavia) *Hiroshi Daifuku (UNESCO) *P.L de Vrieze (Netherlands) *Harald Langberg (Denmark) *Mario Matteucci (Italy) *Jean Merlet (France) *Carlos Flores Marini (Mexico) *Roberto Pane (Italy) *S.C.J. Pavel (Czechoslovakia) *Paul Philippot (ICCROM) *Victor Pimentel (Peru) *Harold Plenderleith (United Kingdom & ICCROM) *Deoclecio Redig de Campos (Vatican) *Jean Sonnier (France) *Francois Sorlin (France) *Eustathios Stikas (Greece) *Mrs. Gertrud Tripp (Austria) *Jan Zachwatowicz (Poland) *Mustafa S. Zbiss (Tunisia)  Outcome  The Venice Charter is the most influential document on conservation since 1964. However the following aspects are not covered in the Venice Charter: * The concept of site which also applies to historic landscapes and gardens * The concept of reversibility in restoration * The social and financial issues In the years after the publishing, the purpose of the charter a number of symposiums took place in order to improve common understandings and awareness of it by those involved in the conservation and restoration works of the historic buildings. How it was applied in different countries varied according to their social, economic and cultural conditions, as well as the technical qualifications of those applying it. Translation mistakes and misunderstandings of the Charter also led to differences in its application. Criticism The Venice Charter and its subsequent interpretations have attracted criticism, especially by those who perceive it was built upon the Modernist biases of its creators. Professor of architecture Samir Youn√©s has written: \\"The Charter‚Äôs abhorrence of restoration and reconstruction ‚Äì with its implicit fear of \\"false history\\" ‚Äì reflects the Modernist theory of historical determinism, rather than the idea of a living architectural tradition. Major advances over the last 40 years in traditional design fluency and building crafts skills have undercut and outmoded many of the assumptions implicit in the Venice Charter. As a result, many now believe that visual harmony, aesthetic balance and the essential character of a place are of greater importance than abstract Modernist theories.\\"Hardy, Matthew (Ed.) The Venice Charter Revisited: Modernism, Conservation and Tradition in the 21st Century, foreword by HRH The Prince of Wales, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; 2008 Issue is taken particularly with the words in Article 9: \\"Any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and must bear a contemporary stamp.\\" This declaration has had a major impact on the management of historic buildings globally. In the U.S., for example, it shaped the Secretary of the Interior‚Äôs Standard #9 so it stated \\"...new work shall be differentiated from the old\\". It has been commonly interpreted to mean that interventions and additions have to be in Modernist styles, rather than being discreetly indicated by such devices as dated cornerstones and descriptive plaques. Many popular reconstructions now considered intrinsic to their locations, such as the 1912 rebuilding of the Campanile di San Marco in Venice, would violate the Venice Charter‚Äôs dictum: ‚ÄúAll reconstruction work should however be ruled out \\"a priori\\". Because of concern over the damage being to historic settings by the Venice Charter's misapplication, in 2006 another conference was held in Venice under the auspices of INTBAU (the International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture & Urbanism). Its principal objective was to provide a theoretical framework that would enable new buildings and additions to be in greater harmony with their historic surroundings. Critics of the Venice Charter point to the 2005 Charleston Charter as providing preferred guidelines for dealing with historic areas. It states: ‚ÄúNew construction in historic settings, including alterations and additions to existing buildings, should not arbitrarily impose contrasting materials, scales, or design vocabularies, but clarify and extend the character of the place, seeking always continuity and wholeness in the built environment.‚Äù Revisions Beginning with the World Heritage Convention (1972), some of the limited explanations in the Venice Charter were revised. The understanding of cultural heritage, which was expressed as historic monuments, was categorized as monuments, groups of buildings and sites. Later on The Nara Document on Authenticity (1992) carried out the responsibility to clarify the authenticity related issues which were expressed in the articles 6 and 7 of the Venice Charter. In the Naples ICOMOS meeting on 7 November 1995; the question ‚ÄòShould there be a review of the Venice Charter?‚Äô was discussed with participation of Raymound Lemaire, the reporter of the Venice Charter in 1964. Thirty years after the Venice Charter, Lemaire declared that: \\"Charters are fashionable. They are considered to contribute to directing action. However they never contain more than the minimum on which the majority has agreed. Only exceptionally do they cover the whole of the issue which concerns them. This is the case with the Venice Charter.\\" He further stated his opinions about the present understanding of monuments and their restoration. He pointed out the necessity of a new document, or an effective adaptation, with consideration of the need \\"to be addressed with caution and wisdom, with respect for all cultures and above all with ethical and intellectual discipline.\\" The Venice Charter has itself become an historic document. While some of its guidelines are considered to have proven their worth by both its supporters and critics, there are now plans for it to be rewritten.

The neighborhood is part of Brooklyn Community Board 16 and was founded in 1890. The ZIP code for the neighborhood is 11233. Ocean Hill's boundaries start from Broadway and the neighborhood of Bushwick in the north, Ralph Avenue and the neighborhoods of Bedford- Stuyvesant proper and Crown Heights to the west, East New York Avenue and the neighborhood of Brownsville to the south, and Van Sinderen Avenue and the neighborhood of East New York to the east. History Ocean Hill was named because it was slightly hilly. Ocean Hill was subdivided from the larger community of Stuyvesant Heights. From the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s Ocean Hill was an Italian enclave. By the late 1960s Ocean Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant proper together formed the largest African American community in the United States. In 1968, the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school district experienced a major teachers' strike. At that time, the New York City Board of Education controlled the entire school system. In response to complaints from parents in poor minority neighborhoods that schools were failing their students, the Ford Foundation helped fund an experimental program in the district that gave control to local educators and families. The program started off smoothly, but it ended as a fiery chapter in city history. Charging that Board of Education employees were seeking to sabotage the decentralization effort, black district leaders exiled 13 teachers and six administrators‚Äîmost of them Jewish‚Äîto other districts. As the United Federation of Teachers protested the transfers, the two sides traded harsh accusations of racism and anti-Semitism. Teachers declared a months' long strike that shuttered most of the city‚Äôs schools. The conflict finally ended when the Board of Education agreed to set up local school boards throughout the city.Weisman, Steven R. \\"A City at War\\", The New York Times, March 1, 1997. Accessed July 6, 2016. In 1977, a major blackout devastated New York City. The neighborhood experienced arson and ransacking. Many apartment buildings were badly burned and abandoned for many years like the ones in the South Bronx. Finally in the 1990s Ocean Hill experienced a revitalization as many abandoned buildings and lots were renovated.  Gentrification  Ocean Hill is in the process of gentrification. An increasing number of people of various ethnicities are moving into the area due to slightly lower rent prices in Brownsville and eastern Crown Heights. Many abandoned buildings and brownstones have been rehabilitated. Prospect Plaza Houses, once a notorious housing project unit, has been closed by the New York City Housing Authority and is in the process of being rebuilt under the federally funded HOPE VI program. There are attempts to overhaul the area to resemble Fort Greene- Clinton Hill due to the low rents and massive retail space. Brownstones, tenement and regular houses in the area are among the lowest in Brooklyn, ranging from $300,000 to $600,000. Many residents of Ocean Hill consider themselves residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Due to gentrification, many real estate developers and the community board use the name Bedford- Stuyvesant/Ocean Hill or just Bedford-Stuyvesant, to avoid the neighborhood being confused with neighboring Brownsville to the southeast.  Broadway Junction  Ocean Hill, itself a sub-neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, also contains the sub-sub-neighborhood of Broadway Junction, defined by Broadway to the north, Atlantic Avenue to the south, Rockaway Avenue to the west, and Van Sinderen Avenue to the east., p. 141. The area is mostly zoned for light commercial and industrial use, but there is some residential development in the area which consists of two- to three-story residences. Broadway Junction is split roughly in half by the Atlantic Avenue/LIRR viaduct, with few connections between the two parts of the neighborhood. This disconnect, combined with small blocks and relatively underused streets, parcels, and public spaces, has led to the subsection's characterization as a blighted area, and as such, it is largely ignored by neighboring communities. There are plans to add mixed-use areas in Broadway Junction, as well as rezone the area for residential, commercial, and industrial developments, as well as improve transit connectivity in the area. A plan put forth by the New York City Department of Transportation would make Broadway Junction into a transportation hub, with residential integration with Ocean Hill on the west and mixed-use industrial and commercial properties on the east. Broadway Junction was originally known as Jamaica Pass, a name that became famous in 1776 as the route the British Army marched from southern Kings County to attack Brooklyn during the Battle of Long Island.Schecter, Barnet. The Battle for New York - The City at the Heart of the American Revolution. Walker & Company. New York. 2002. The current name refers to the current Broadway Junction subway station, which once connected to the LIRR and the Fulton Street El as well. Nearby is the Cemetery of the Evergreens, and Highland Park. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Ocean Hill was 31,935, an increase of 1,868 (6.2%) from the 30,067 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

From the 1960s to early 2000s, Ocean Hill and neighboring Brownsville experienced a high crime rate, but by 2019, the crime rates reached an all-time low. Transportation Ocean Hill is served by the of the New York City Subway, on the BMT Canarsie Line, BMT Jamaica Line, and IND Fulton Street Line, which all meet at Broadway Junction.

Notable members and collaborators were Sperone Speroni, Benedetto Varchi, Pietro Aretino, Girolamo Preti Luigi Alamanni, Ugolino Martelli, Alessandro Piccolomini, and Angelo Beolco (el Ruzante). Some of the Academy's activities were conducted in Greek and Latin. However, the vulgar Venetian and Tuscan languages became prevalent after Speroni, a staunch defender of the vernacular, presided over the academy in 1542. In this period the Academy promoted lectures (Lezioni) on vernacular poetry, such as on Bembo's sonnets Piansi e cantai l'aspra guerra and Verdeggi all'Apennin la fronte, e 'l petto, by Martelli, and on Forteguerri's sonnet Ora ten va superbo, or corre altero, by Piccolomini.

Although their line up has changed many times over the years, The Scruffs, centered around Burns, have continued to release records up through the 2010s.SXSW.comThe AquarianYahoo.com History=Formation and early years (1974‚Äì1976) Formed in 1974 by singer/songwriter and guitarist Stephen Burns, who would cut classes at the University of Memphis to rehearse and record, the group spent a two-year period in which it would write music and rehearse in a warehouse at Shoe Studio and then record at Ardent Studios when it had enough songs. Rick Branyan left the band in 1976, and Andy Tanus, Ken Woodley, and Van Duren were brought into the studio to play bass, with Bill Godley ultimately filling the role until Branyan's return a year later. Burns' high school friend, Tommy Hoehn, who led the power pop group Prix, was brought in for backing vocals. During this period, the band recorded many of the songs (most penned by Burns or Burns co-writing with David Branyan) that would later appear on its first album. The songs from this period were collected and released more than twenty years later on the anthology Angst: The Early Recordings 1974-1976. Big Star producer Jim Dickinson, who was working on Big Star's Third/Sister Lovers at Ardent when The Scruffs began recording there, and who heard The Scruffs' demos in their earliest stages, recalled that people on the local scene expected The Scruffs to take the radio by storm. Dickinson said of these early recordings, \\"If there's going to be a Scruffs history, that's it . . . . It really does represent, if not the end, then the beginning of the end of something in Memphis music. After that, nobody even tried to do that again.\\" Wanna Meet the Scruffs? and initial breakup In early 1977, the Scruffs released their first single, \\"Break the Ice,\\" on Power Play records. The record received local airplay in Memphis. The Scruffs then returned to Ardent to re-record a selection of their material and, later in 1977, released the new recordings as their first LP, Wanna Meet the Scruffs?. Those critics who heard the album were unanimous in their praise. Village Voice rock critic Robert Christgau wrote: The album, however, received only local airplay and little more. In August 1978, the group began recording a follow-up album. After completing six songs, the band moved to New York City and played at CBGB and Max's Kansas City. In 1979, Rick Branyan moved back to Memphis, and was replaced by Steve Wood. Several months later, Dave Branyan quit mid- performance and was replaced by a local guitarist, Steve O'Rourke. In October 1979, the group recorded the rest of the follow-up album at Ardent Studios in Memphis. Returning to New York, the band opened for acts as disparate as Chuck Berry, Johnny Thunders, and Peter Noone. Although they received major label interest, they were unable to secure a record deal for their second album. That album, Teenage Gurls, would finally be released almost twenty years later. As one critic would write of the album, \\"the band is in great form throughout, sounding tighter and fuller than on the debut, and there are more than a few excellent songs here, especially 'Alice, Please Don't Go,' 'Danger,' and 'Go Faster.'\\" By 1981, having only released the single Shakin‚Äô from the album, the group disbanded. 1980s After the group's initial break-up, many of the members pursued other careers. Rick Branyan became a Latin teacher at a local private high school in Memphis. David Branyan pursued a solo career recording again at Ardent Studios, before attending Columbia and Yale universities. Burns returned to Memphis from New York in 1982, and continued to record sporadically as The Scruffs with various musicians throughout the rest of the 1980s while finishing his liberal arts degree at the University of Memphis and obtaining a second degree in business and accounting. These recordings were eventually released as The Scruffs' third album, MidTown. Noting the influence of Memphis's seminal power pop group, Robert Christgau wrote of the album, \\"it's Memphis, it's the '80s, and darn it, Big Star lives ('Machiavellian Eyes,' 'Judy [She Put the Devil in Me]').\\" 1990s-2000s Burns took a hiatus from recording, during which time he worked in his father's insurance business and married and divorced. Burns then regrouped with a new lineup of musicians and, in 1997, released the album Signs & Symbols under the group name \\"Messenger 45.\\" The album was re-released with a different track order in 2013 as The Scruffs' album Back from the Grave, and is considered the group's fourth studio album chronologically. Writing in AllMusic, critic Mark Deming observed that the album \\"marked a creative departure for Burns,\\" finding him \\"writing lusher and more complex music . . . . But Burns' fondness for British-influenced pop hasn't left him, and if [the album] is a very different kettle of fish from the classic Wanna Meet the Scruffs?, it suggests that he still believes a nice melody and a good hook are the keys to the universe -- and who knows, he may well be right.\\" In the late 1990s, Big Star co-founder Alex Chilton convinced Burns to follow him to Glasgow, Scotland, where Big Star and The Scruffs themselves had been proclaimed a major influence by Scottish bands constituting what the press had dubbed \\"The Bellshill Sound.\\" Burns reformed The Scruffs in Glasgow with local musicians Bobby Kildea, Stevie Jackson and Stuart Murdoch of Belle and Sebastian renown, Zachary Ware, guitarist with The Proclaimers, Francis MacDonald of Teenage Fanclub and BMX Bandits fame, and Wil O‚ÄôBrien, guitarist for Los Angeles based power pop bands The Andersons!, and Receiver. The group began recording at CaVa Studios in Glasgow. The new material was mixed at Ardent in Memphis. It was released in 2002 as The Scruffs' fifth album, Love, The Scruffs, initially only in Japan, where The Scruffs enjoyed a loyal following. Two tours in Japan followed over the next two years. In 2003, The Scruffs released their sixth album, Swingin' Singles. Although now principally living back in the United States, Burns continued to work in, variously, Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as Memphis. Although The Scruffs primarily toured in Europe and Japan, the group played its first concert in Memphis in over 20 years in 2006 while working on a new album at Ardent. At the end of 2006, The Scruffs released their seventh album, Pop Manifesto, to many favorable reviews. One critic wrote that \\"Burns is still writing terrific songs with glorious melodies and superb hooks, which is the real link between this music and his past,\\" calling the album \\"a fine and well-crafted visit to smart pop heaven that proves Stephen Burns isn't running out of interesting ideas.\\" David Bash ranked the album at number 5 on his top 125 albums of 2007 list. 2010s-  In 2009, The Scruffs began recording songs for their eighth studio album, first in Glasgow and later in Memphis. Conquest was released in January 2010 to, once more, many favorable reviews. In his AllMusic review, critic William Ruhlman wrote that \\"Burns retains his talent for catchy melodies and his lyrical fascination with young women . . . while as a record-maker he evokes mid-‚Äò60s Beach Boys and Beatles, along with mid-‚Äò70s Electric Light Orchestra.\\" Encouraged by the response to Conquest, The Scruffs reconvened in Edinburgh in early 2010 to commence rehearsals for another album, recording the material at Ardent in November 2010. The Scruffs' principal line up for these recordings was Burns (guitar, vocals, producer), Adam Hill (guitars, backing vocals, additional bass), Bobby Kildea (bass, backing vocals, percussion) and Mark Rodgers (drums, percussion), with the Vest Brothers (also from Memphis) providing backing vocals and guitar. Peter Buck of R.E.M. also made a guest appearance on one song. Mastered at Abbey Road Studios in London, England, Kill! Kill!, The Scruffs' ninth studio album, was released in February 2011. One critic described it as \\"a McCartney-esque pop tour de force that sounds fresh and surprisingly fierce coming from a band in its 36th year of existence,\\" stating that it showed why Burns \\"might be the most vital remaining member of the now somewhat legendary Memphis power-pop scene of the 1970s.\\" Discography=Studio albums *Wanna Meet the Scruffs? ‚Äì (Power Play Records, 1977) HLPP-5050 *TeenAge Gurls ‚Äì (recorded 1978-1979; Northern Heights Records, 1998) NHM-40214 *MidTown ‚Äì (recorded 1982-1989; Northern Heights Records, 1998) NHM-40216 *Back from the Grave ‚Äì (Northern Heights Records, 1997) NHM-40220 *Love, The Scruffs ‚Äì (Nippon Crown Co., Ltd.

It is named after the English physician, William James West (1793‚Äì1848), who first described it in an article published in The Lancet in 1841. The original case actually described his own son, James Edwin West (1840‚Äì1860). Other names for it are \\"generalized flexion epilepsy\\", \\"infantile epileptic encephalopathy\\", \\"infantile myoclonic encephalopathy\\", \\"jackknife convulsions\\", \\"massive myoclonia\\" and \\"Salaam spasms\\". The term \\"infantile spasms\\" can be used to describe the specific seizure manifestation in the syndrome, but is also used as a synonym for the syndrome itself. West syndrome in modern usage is the triad of infantile spasms, a pathognomonic EEG pattern (called hypsarrhythmia), and developmental regression ‚Äì although the international definition requires only two out of these three elements. The syndrome is age-related, generally occurring between the third and the twelfth month, generally manifesting around the fifth month. There are various causes. The syndrome is often caused by an organic brain dysfunction whose origins may be prenatal, perinatal (caused during birth) or postnatal. Signs and symptoms The epileptic seizures which can be observed in infants with West syndrome fall into three categories, collectively known as infantile spasms. Typically, the following triad of attack types appears; while the three types usually appear simultaneously, they also can occur independently of each other: * Lightning attacks: Sudden, severe myoclonic convulsions of the entire body or several parts of the body in split seconds, and the legs in particular are bent (flexor muscle convulsions here are generally more severe than extensor ones). *Nodding attacks: Convulsions of the throat and neck flexor muscles, during which the chin is fitfully jerked towards the breast or the head is drawn inward. *Salaam or jackknife attacks: a flexor spasm with rapid bending of the head and torso forward and simultaneous raising and bending of the arms while partially drawing the hands together in front of the chest and/or flailing. If one imagined this act in slow motion, it would appear similar to the Muslim ceremonial greeting (Salaam), from which this type of attack derives its name. Cause It is still unknown which bio-chemical mechanisms lead to the occurrence of West syndrome. It is conjectured that it is a malfunction of neurotransmitter function, or more precisely, a malfunction in the regulation of the GABA transmission process. Another possibility being researched is a hyper-production of the Corticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH). It is possible that more than one factor is involved. Both hypotheses are supported by the effect of certain medications used to treat West syndrome. Cases of epilepsy have been historically divided into three different groups: symptomatic, cryptogenic, and unknown. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) recommended in 2011 to abandon these termshttp://www.ilae.org/Visitors/Centre/ctf/documents/NewConcepts- Classification_2011_000.pdfhttp://www.ilae.org/Visitors/Centre/ctf/CTFoverview.cfm for reasons of clarity and instead try to place individual cases into one of the following 3 groups: genetic, structural/metabolic, and unknown. The new terms are more immediately clear in their meaning, except that the structural and metabolic group includes cases that have a genetic component that does not always directly lead to the condition. Only the genetic grouping has a known direct genetic cause. \\"Unknown\\" cases may be of unknown genetic, structural, metabolic, or other unknown cause. The old terminology was defined by the ILAE as follows: * symptomatic: the epilepsy is the consequence of a known or suspected disorder of the central nervous system. * cryptogenic: this refers to a disorder whose cause is hidden or occult. Cryptogenic epilepsies are presumed to be symptomatic. * idiopathic: there is no underlying cause other than a possible hereditary predisposition. The remainder of this section will refer to the older terminology. Symptomatic If a cause presents itself, the syndrome is referred to as symptomatic West syndrome, as the attacks manifest as a symptom of another problem. Almost any cause of brain damage could be associated, and these are divided into prenatal, perinatal, and post- natal. The following is a partial list: *In around one third of the children, there is evidence of a profound organic disorder of the brain. This includes: **microcephaly **cortical dysplasia **cerebral atrophy **lissencephaly **bacterial meningitis **phakomatoses (e.g. tuberous sclerosis) **Aicardi syndrome **cephalhematoma and **vascular malformation. *Furthermore, other causes increasingly being named in the literature are: **Incontinentia pigmenti **Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome **Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) **Sturge- Weber syndrome **neurometabolic diseases **congential infections (e.g. Cytomegalovirus) **hypoglycemia **brain damage due to asphyxiation or hypoxia (lack of oxygen, e.g. during birth), periventricular leukomalacia, cephalhematoma, cerebrovascular accident or brain damage of various types as well as that caused by premature birth. =Down syndrome= West syndrome appears in 1% to 5% of infants with Down syndrome. This form of epilepsy is relatively difficult to treat in children who do not have the chromosomal abnormalities involved in Down syndrome. However, in children with Down syndrome, the syndrome is often far more mild, and the children often react better to medication. The German Down Syndrom InfoCenter noted in 2003 that what was normally a serious epilepsy was in such cases often a relatively benign one. EEG records for children with Down syndrome are often more symmetrical with fewer unusual findings. Although not all children can become entirely free from attacks with medication, children with Down syndrome are less likely to go on to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or other forms of epilepsy than those without additional hereditary material on the 21st chromosome. The reason why it is easier to treat children with Down syndrome is not known. If, however, a child with Down syndrome has seizures that are difficult to control, the child should be assessed for autistic spectrum disorder.Goldberg-Stern et al., 2001 & Eisermann et al. 2003 in: American Journal of Medical Genetics part C, 2006, S. 163: Neurobehavioral disorders in children, adolescents and young adults with down syndrome Cryptogenic When a direct cause cannot be determined but the child has other neurological disorder, the case is referred to as cryptogenic West syndrome. The cryptogenic group is often considered idiopathic while referred to as \\"cryptogenic\\". Sometimes multiple children within the same family develop West syndrome. In this case, it is also referred to as cryptogenic, in which genetic and sometimes hereditary influences play a role. There are known cases in which West syndrome appears in successive generations in boys; this has to do with X-chromosomal heredity. Genetic Mutations in several genes have been associated with West syndrome. These include the Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) and cyclin dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) genes.Bahi-Buisson N, Bienvenu T (2012) CDKL5-related disorders: from clinical description to molecular genetics. Mol Syndromol 2(3-5):137-152 The ARX gene in particular seems to be responsible for at least some of the X linked cases.Sherr EH (2003) The ARX story (epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, and cerebral malformations): one gene leads to many phenotypes. Curr Opin Pediatr 15(6):567-571 Variants in the KCNT1 gene (also known as SLACK potassium ion channel gene) can result in West syndrome https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525917/ Idiopathic Occasionally the syndrome is referred to as idiopathic West syndrome, when a cause cannot be determined. Important diagnostic criteria are: *Regular development until the onset of the attacks or before the beginning of the therapy *no pathological findings in neurological or neuroradiological studies *no evidence of a trigger for the spasms Those are becoming rare due to modern medicine. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be made by EEG. In case of epileptic spasms, EEG shows typical hypsarrhythmia patterns. Treatment As of 2017, data on optimal treatment was limited. Therapies with hormones is the standard of care, namely adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), or oral corticosteroids such as prednisone. Vigabatrin is also a common consideration, though there is a risk of visual field loss with long term use. The high cost of ACTH leads doctors to avoid it in the US; higher dose prednisone appears to generate equivalent outcomes. As of 2017 data from clinical trials of the ketogenic diet for treating infantile spams was inconsistent; most trials were as a second-line therapy after failure of drug treatment, and as of 2017 it had not been explored as a first line treatment in an adequately designed clinical trial. Epilepsy surgery is recommended in patients with seizures arising from a restricted region. Prognosis It is not possible to make a generalised prognosis for development due to the variability of causes, as mentioned above, the differing types of symptoms and cause. Each case must be considered individually. The prognosis for children with idiopathic West syndrome are mostly more positive than for those with the cryptogenic or symptomatic forms. Idiopathic cases are less likely to show signs of developmental problems before the attacks begin, the attacks can often be treated more easily and effectively and there is a lower relapse rate. Children with this form of the syndrome are less likely to go on to develop other forms of epilepsy; around two in every five children develop at the same rate as healthy children. In other cases, however, treatment of West syndrome is relatively difficult and the results of therapy often dissatisfying; for children with symptomatic and cryptogenic West syndrome, the prognosis is generally not positive, especially when they prove resistant to therapy. Statistically, 5 out of every 100 children with West syndrome do not survive beyond five years of age, in some cases due to the cause of the syndrome, in others for reasons related to their medication. Only less than half of all children can become entirely free from attacks with the help of medication. Statistics show that treatment produces a satisfactory result in around three out of ten cases, with only one in every 25 children's cognitive and motoric development developing more or less normally. A large proportion (up to 90%) of children suffer severe physical and cognitive impairments, even when treatment for the attacks is successful. This is not usually because of the epileptic fits, but rather because of the causes behind them (cerebral anomalies or their location or degree of severity). Severe, frequent attacks can (further) damage the brain. Permanent damage often associated with West syndrome in the literature include cognitive disabilities, learning difficulties and behavioural problems, cerebral palsy (up to 5 out of 10 children), psychological disorders and often autism (in around 3 out of 10 children). Once more, the cause of each individual case of West syndrome must be considered when debating cause and effect. As many as 6 out of 10 children with West syndrome suffer from epilepsy later in life. Sometimes West syndrome turns into a focal or other generalised epilepsy. Around half of all children develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Epidemiology Incidence is around 1:3200 to 1:3500 of live births. Statistically, boys are more likely to be affected than girls at a ratio of around 3:2. In 9 out of every 10 children affected, the spasms appear for the first time between the third and the twelfth month of age. In rarer cases, spasms may occur in the first two months or during the second to fourth year of age. History West syndrome was named after the English doctor and surgeon William James West (1793‚Äì1848), who lived in Tonbridge. In 1841 he observed this type of epilepsy in his own son, James E West, who was approximately four months old at the time. He published his observations from a scientific perspective in an article in The Lancet. He named the seizures \\"Salaam Tics\\" at the time.

The same year, she married George Walsh whom she had met on the set of Intolerance. The marriage lasted until their divorce in 1924. A regular player for the rest of the silent era, Owen appeared in films such as Maurice Tourneur's Victory in 1919 where she was photographed to great effect by Tourneur's cameraman, Rene Guissart. Victory, long lost, was recently found in 35mm print in Europe and can be seen on DVD. In 1920, she appeared in The Gift Supreme with Lon Chaney, who appeared with her in Victory.

He was one of the most notable representatives of Serbian Baroque literature along with Zaharije Orfelin, Pavle Julinac, Vasilije III Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, Simeon Konƒçareviƒá, Simeon Pi≈°ƒçeviƒá, and others (although he worked in the first half of 18th century, as Baroque trends in Serbian literature emerged in the late 17th century). Rajiƒá was the forerunner to modern Serbian historiography, and has been compared to the importance of Nikolay Karamzin to Russian historiography. Biography Rajiƒá was born on September 21, 1726, in Sremski Karlovci. Jovan received his elementary education in his native town, in the school of Deacon Petar Rajkov, a more zealous than learned successor of his own imported Russian teachers, notably Emanuel Kozaƒçinski. It was through Rajkov that young Jovan Rajiƒá would learn Serbian historiography, which belonged to the latter group. He attended Novi Sad's Petrovaradinska ro≈ædestveno-bogorodiƒçina ≈°kola latinsko-slovenska, the Latino-Slavonic School of Our Lady for young theologians, founded by Visarion Pavloviƒá and where Russian-born academic Emanuel Kozaƒçinski first began teaching in 1731. He also attended the first Serbian chant school, founded by Metropolitan Mojsije Petroviƒá in 1721, where he learned \\"psalm chants\\" in Serbian and in Greek. In 1744 he moved to Kom√°rom where he attended a Jesuit gymnasium for four years. Fearing to be converted, he became a student of Protestant lyc√©e in Sopron in 1748. He graduated in 1752 and he was ostensibly headed for the church. But his tastes lead him in a different direction for the time being; not content with a knowledge of books only, he wished to know the world and people better. During a period of almost ten years, he seized every opportunity for profitable travel whenever he could. He travelled on foot from Hungary to Russian Empire ‚Äì a distance of 800 miles -‚Äî where he enrolled as a student of the prestigious Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. He remained in Kiev until 1756 studying theology and liberal arts. He immediately formed a friendship with his professors, many of whom were disciples of Feofan Prokopovich, the great reformer of the Russian Orthodox Church and one of the founders of the Russian Academy of Sciences. After graduating from the Kiev academy he travelled to Moscow and Smolensk. For the next few months, he led an unsettled life, attracting attention everywhere by his talents and boldness of his teaching. On his way home he also visited Poland and various parts of Hungary. In 1757 he returned to his native Sremski Karlovci and sought a teaching position at a seminary called Pokrovo-Bogorodiƒçina ≈°kola, which was denied. Dejected and hurt, he decided to go back to Imperial Russia. He arrived in 1757 back in Kiev where he stayed only for a short time. That same year he travelled to Poland, Wallachia, Moldavia before taking a ship across the Black Sea to Constantinople, and from there to Mount Athos, where he spent a few months at the Serbian Monastery of Hilandar, doing research in the library. It wasn't until late 1759 that he became a professor of geography and rhetoric in Pokrovo-Bogorodiƒçina ≈°kola in Sremski Karlovci. Entering a conflict with high representatives of Serbian Orthodox Church in Sremski Karlovci, he moved to Temesvar, modern-day Romania. Life at the episcopal residence was luxurious. Though Rajiƒá resisted the evils attendant on such luxury‚Äîloose morals, drunkenness, intrigue‚Äîhe did acquire a vice which was to embitter the rest of his days, avarice. But more important, he found time in Temesvar to work on his History. After a turbulent year and a half, Rajiƒá left for Novi Sad at the invitation of the Serbian Bishop of Baƒçka, Mojsije Putnik. He was inaugurated rector of the institution of higher learning, Duhovna kolegija, by Metropolitan Pavle Nenadoviƒá of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci in 1767. There he stayed for more than four years as both rector and professor of theology. His lectures, in which he endeavoured to show that Orthodox theology is in complete harmony with reason, were received with eager interest by the younger generation of thinkers. His unshakable faith in Reason awakened and inspired his students and thus prepared succeeding generations to traverse paths which were closed to Orfelin and to his Serbian contemporaries. In 1772 he went to Kovilj monastery where, at the age of 46, Rajiƒá became a monk and soon after he was elevated to the monastic rank of archimandrite, and made abbot of the same monastery. He spent the rest of his life in the monastery writing books, mostly with religious and theological themes. In a fruitful lifetime which spanned the last three-quarters of the eighteenth century, Rajiƒá brought Rationalism to its zenith among Serbs in Serbian lands. He died in the Serbian Kovilj monastery on December 22, 1801. Works Jovan Rajiƒá's The History of Various Slavic Peoples, especially of Bulgars, Croats and Serbs, Museum of Vuk and Dositej He wrote in Serbian, Russian, Latin, German, Hungarian and Old Bulgarian. He was one of the best educated Serbian ecclesiastical scholars who knew theology and history better than most in his day. He translated the works of Feofan Prokopovich, Peter Mohyla, Platon Levshin, Lazar Baranovych, Metropolitan Gedeon of Kiev, and various German and Hungarian authors. He wrote the history of the Serbian Orthodox Church and a Serbian catechesis for children which was first published in Vienna in 1774 and was consequently reprinted many times over for the next 89 years. He is best remembered for his history books. All of Rajiƒá's research work came from Russian and Serbian sources, particularly ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá's then unpublished, 2,000-page manuscript. He was a most liberal-minded man, both in politics and religion, an enthusiastic supporter of popular education and a most inspiring teacher and speaker. Rajiƒá was always stating that the business of the Eastern Orthodox Church as a whole is not polemic but irenic, operating toward peace, moderation and conciliation. He took great interest in the struggle of the Serbs for independence. His claim on posterity, however, lies not on his irenical writings alone but in the quality of his literary translations and other writings, exhibited at its best in the four-volume work, published in Vienna and Moscow, \\"Istorija raznih slavenskih narodov, naipaƒçe Bolgar, Horvatov i Serbov (1794-1795)\\" (The History of various Slavic peoples, particularly the Bulgarians, Croats and Serbs). The Istorija, including the 1795 edition in Moscow that sealed its authority, was bound to the medieval religious historiographical tradition and was influenced by not only Brankoviƒá's work but also the Russian editions of Caesar Baronius's \\"Annales Ecclesiastici\\", Mavro Orbin's \\"Il regno de gli Slavi\\" (The Realm of the Slavs), and Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange's \\"Illyricum vetus et nuovum\\" (1746) (Illyrium: Old and New). Rajiƒá's work is divided into four volumes, each sub-divided in three parts dealing respectively with the history of Bulgarians, Croats and Serbs. His intention was to reconstruct the history of the south Slavic peoples as if they were a single entity. He placed at the centre of his research the people and the new historical sensibility that must serve them. The past was re-evaluated from two main perspectives: to preserve Slav history from falling into oblivion; and to save it from a memory imbued with personal events bound to the tradition of dynastic claims. From the preface it can be inferred that Rajiƒá saw history as the basis for other sciences. Also, Rajiƒá paid attention to the Habsburg dynasty and considered them defenders of the Serbs against Turkish oppression. Yet, at the same time, he cautioned them against the Habsburg's attempts of Germanization and conversion to Uniate Catholicism.

It was founded in 1149 or 1150 by Ulrich von Tarasp and other nobles. It has maintained a long tradition of education and, at 1,340 m, it is Europe‚Äôs highest abbey. It retains a Baroque style with Romanesque elements, and has some well-maintained frescos. History The history of the foundation goes back to Charlemagne, who established the St. John Benedictine monastery between 780 and 786 in M√ºstair further up in the valley. Sometime after 880, the Benedictine monastery was dissolved and re-established as a convent for both sexes. About two hundred years later there was a reorganization, when Eberhard of Tarasp built the monastery of Schuls in the Inn valley in the Engadin for the male portion of the community, while nuns remained at Taufers in the Adige valley. After the monastery at Schuls had been rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131, Ulrich von Tarasp called monks from the German monastery of Ottobeuren to revive it; the additional numbers made it possible to raise the community from a priory to an abbey. In 1149 or 1150 the community was re-settled on the hill near the village of Burgeis, under the name of Marienberg. About one hundred years after its foundation the abbey suffered from serious conflict. It was sacked twice by nobles under Abbot Konrad III (1271‚Äì98) and in 1304 Abbot Hermann was killed by Ulrich of Matsch. The Black Death killed all but four members of the abbey including Abbot Wyho and Goswin, a lay brother, who later became a priest and chronicled the history of the monastery. This chronicle is divided into three books, the first of which details the story of the foundation and donations to the abbey. The second book of the chronicle is a history of the abbots, and the third recites the privileges conferred by popes and princes. It gives an account, without regard for order or chronology, of the founders, fortunes, benefactors and oppressors of the monastery. Goswin later became a prior of the abbey and court chaplain to Duke Leopold III of Austria. In 1418 Marienberg was burned down and was later rebuilt. After a period of decline in the sixteenth century, several German monks helped to restore and expand the abbey. Abbot Mathias Lang (1615‚Äì40), from Weingarten Abbey, reformed it, and in 1634 Marienberg joined the Benedictine Congregation of Swabia. Lang's successor, Jacob Grafinger (1640‚Äì53), enlarged the library, and made the younger members finish their education at schools of repute. In 1656 the abbey was again burned down. Abbot Johann Baptist Murr (1705‚Äì32) in 1724 founded a humanistic high school in Meran which is still administered by the monks of Marienberg. Abbot Placidus Zobel (1782-1815) compiled a chronicle of the abbots. In 1807 Marienberg was dissolved by the Bavarian government, but was restored by Emperor Francis II in 1816. Today the monks specialise in adult education: weekend courses and longer retreats are held at the abbey. The abbey itself is available for tours.

The prison was originally built to hold between 500 and 550 prisoners in cells that measured 12 x 7 feet, (365 cm x 213 cm) It was the first prison in Ireland to be built according to \\"The Separate System\\", intended to separate prisoners from each other with no communication between them. Later, especially in the early 1970s, as many as three prisoners were placed in each cell. The first 106 inmates, who were forced to walk from Carrickfergus Prison in chains, arrived in 1846. These inmates, who were men, women and children, completed the changeover of the two prisons. Children from impoverished working-class families were often imprisoned at the gaol in the early years for offences such as stealing food or clothing. Thirteen-year-old Patrick Magee, who had been sentenced to three months in prison, hanged himself in his cell in 1858. Women inmates were kept in the prison block house until the early 1900s. Ulster suffragettes, among them Dorothy Evans and Madge Muir, were imprisoned in the gaol during 1914. Executions When originally designed by Lanyon, the prison did not contain a gallows and the executions were carried out in public view until 1901, when an execution chamber was constructed within the prison walls and used until the last of the hangings in 1961. Seventeen prisoners were executed in the prison, the last being Robert McGladdery who was hanged in 1961 for the murder of Pearl Gamble. The condemned would live in a cell, large enough for two guards to live in as well. The bodies of the executed were buried inside the prison in unconsecrated ground, against the back wall beside the prison hospital. The execution of Tom Williams, a nineteen-year-old member of the IRA, took place on 2 September 1942; he was hanged for the slaying of an RUC officer. The hangman in charge was Thomas Pierrepoint, the gaol's most regular hangman, who carried out six executions in the gaol between 1928 and 1942. Williams was one of two executed prisoners whose remains were disinterred and buried elsewhere.  Escapes and later history  Despite being known as Europe's Alcatraz, there were a number of successful escape attempts at the Gaol. The first recorded escape was in 1866. During its 150-year history the gaol had many prisoners pass through its doors. Some of the more well known prisoners included √âamon de Valera, Martin McGuinness, Michael Stone and Bobby Sands. On 24 November 1991, during the last stages of the Troubles, the Loyalist wing of the prison became the target of a Provisional IRA bomb that killed a UVF and a UDA prisoner. The gaol closed its doors as a prison in 1996 and it was empty for many years. A restoration project was announced in August 2010. In November 2012, the prison opened as a tourist attraction and conference centre and now hosts concerts. The museum welcomed a visit by Queen Elizabeth II in 2014.

He is also a notable inventor, businessman, and social activist. Much of the recording equipment used by Boston had either been built or modified by Scholz himself. Scholz is known for taking his time to perfect Boston's albums; Boston's last three studio albums have been released in 8-year intervals. Scholz has been the only member of Boston to remain for the entire run. Gary Pihl Gary Pihl has been the guitarist for Boston since the departure of Barry Goudreau. He remained with the group for three albums: Third Stage, Walk On and Corporate America, and continues to tour with the band. He was also heavily involved in Scholz Research & Development and the development of the Rockman line of guitar amplifiers. Prior to Boston, he played with Sammy Hagar and with several other bands. Tommy DeCarlo Tommy DeCarlo was a long time Boston fan who sang on stage at the Brad Delp Tribute concert. With a vocal style very reminiscent of Delp, DeCarlo then posted several Boston songs on his website (featuring his vocals). He has been the lead vocalist for the band since 2008. Curly Smith Curly Smith was the drummer in Boston from 1994-1997. He played drums on the Walk On tour and the 2012 and 2014 summer tours. Tracy Ferrie Tracy Ferrie has been touring with the band since 2012, playing bass and providing backing vocals. Brad Delp Bradley E. \\"Brad\\" Delp (June 12, 1951 in Danvers, Massachusetts ‚Äì March 9, 2007 Lead singer of band Boston dies International Herald Tribune, 9 March 2007. Retrieved on 10 March 2007. in Atkinson, New Hampshire) was the lead vocalist of Boston from 1976 up until his death by suicide. He also contributed backup vocals, guitar, harmonica, and keyboards on several Boston albums. While on hiatus from the band, he played in a Beatles tribute band called Beatlejuice. He cited The Beatles as his greatest musical influence. He was also lead vocalist for the Return to Zero and Delp-Goudreau, along with former Boston member Barry Goudreau. Delp sings on all Boston albums except for Walk On. Sib Hashian Sib Hashian (August 17, 1949 in Boston, Massachusetts - March 22, 2017 en route to Nassau, Bahamas) was the drummer for Boston on the group's first two studio albums and also provided drums for a few tracks on Third Stage. Hashian left the band in the early 1980s. Fran Sheehan Fran Sheehan was brought in to play bass shortly after the band signed a recording contract in 1975. He left the group midway through the Third Stage sessions (he received a songwriting credit for \\"Cool the Engines\\"). Barry Goudreau Barry Goudreau (born November 29, 1951) was one of the original guitarists of Boston until he left in 1981. Since leaving, Goudreau has teamed up with several Boston members on various projects, including the band Orion the Hunter, Return to Zero, Delp-Goudreau, Ernie and the Automatics and various tours, appearances and EPs. Jim Masdea Jim Masdea was the original drummer for Boston. He was replaced by Sib Hashian in 1976, just before the band released its debut album. However, he had been heavily involved in arranging the songs for the debut album, receiving an arranger credit, and did play drums on one song, \\"Rock and Roll Band.\\" He returned to the lineup for the Third Stage album and tour. Masdea received the sole writing credit for the Third Stage instrumental song \\"A New World.\\" David Sikes David Sikes was invited to audition for Boston by the band's guitarist Gary Pihl. Sikes began as the bass player for Boston for the Third Stage tour in 1987. Sikes played on four tours (87, 88, 95 and 97) with Boston from 1987-1997 and is credited with co-writing five songs on the Walk On album released in 1994, \\"He was an asset in the recording of the album Walk On,\\" says Boston's founding member Tom Scholz. Sikes also sings lead vocals on the song \\"Tell Me\\", the opening track of the band's 1996 Greatest Hits album. Sikes also played bass for the bands Aldo Nova and Guiffria, previous to joining Boston. Sikes retired from the music business after the 97 tour and now resides in the San Francisco bay area with his wife and two sons. Doug Huffman Doug Huffman was the second drummer for Boston on the Third Stage tour. He was allegedly fired by Tom Scholz for sharing demos from the Walk On sessions. Fran Cosmo Fran Cosmo was featured as the sole lead vocalist on the platinum Boston album Walk On and one of the lead vocalists on the Corporate America. He also sang and played guitar on the tours associated with these albums. He was also the lead singer of Orion The Hunter, a group founded by former Boston lead guitarist Barry Goudreau. Anthony Cosmo Anthony Cosmo is Fran Cosmo's son. He wrote and performed several songs on the album Corporate America and the follow-up tour. He and his father were later sued by Scholz for improper use of the Boston name after they departed in 2006. The suit was settled out of court. Anthony Citrinite Anthony Citrinite performed at the New Year's 2001 performance at the Fiesta Bowl. Was briefly a member in 2001-2002. Tom Hambridge Tom Hambridge briefly replaced Anthony Citrinite on drums in 2002, before being replaced by Jeff Neal.

In the 1890s, two groups were formed in literary criticism, one by the critics gathered around the literary journal Delo, and the other led by Ljubomir Nediƒá. He was the first to apply aesthetic criteria to literature in his theoretical and critical contributions to the periodical Srpski pregled, the Serbian Review. Biography Ljubomir Nediƒá was born in Belgrade, Serbia, on 24 April 1858. His philosophical work was neglected by the historians of Serbian philosophy from the moment the Nazi- occupied the country in 1941 and suppressed after the end of World War II by the communists who took power. It wasn't until the break-up of Communist Yugoslavia in the 1990s that interest in his work re-kindled. Nediƒá was educated chiefly in Belgrade, Jena and Leipzig where he studied medicine, attending lectures on anatomy and psychology and visiting hospitals. After some contemplation, he abandoned medicine in favor of philosophy, logic, and psychology. Ljubomir Nediƒá was a student of the world-renowned Wilhelm Wundt, \\"the father of experimental psychology\\". Nediƒá's doctoral thesis, defended in 1884, was on contemporary British logic, primarily that of Sir William Hamilton. In 1885 he was made a doctor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig in recognition of Die Lehre von der Quantification des Pradikats in der neuern englische Logik (The Doctrine Concerning the Quantified Predicate in Recent English Philosophy) his year-long research paper written in London. After ten years spent abroad studying at Jena, Leipzig, and London universities, he completed his doctorate under Wundt, and obtained a professorship at Belgrade's Grandes √©coles (Velika ≈†kola), where he acquired great influence by the dignity of his personal character. In Belgrade, in 1889 he wrote and published O sofizmima (On Sophisms), which brought him more recognition. During the following years, he published works on Plato and Socrates, as well as a history of philosophy. The strain of the 14 years of continuous work undermined his health and he was compelled to retire from his professorship at the Grande √âcole (which became accredited as the University of Belgrade in 1905) in 1899. After his retirement, he further developed his philosophical position, a speculative eclecticism through which he endeavored to reconcile metaphysical idealism with the naturalistic and mechanical standpoint of science. In 1890, two groups were formed in literary criticism: one led by Nediƒá, and the other by the critics gathered around the literary journal Delo. Nediƒá was the first to apply in the 1890s aesthetic criteria to literature in his theoretical and critical contributions to the periodical Srpski pregled, of which he was the editor. In 1901 Nediƒá published his second book \\"Noviji srpski pisci\\", as an introduction included the chapter \\"O knji≈æevnoi kritiki\\". By then, he was already established as a Serbian new literary critic. Thought Ljubomir Nediƒá's significance in the history of Serbian thought depends on his position as the philosopher of the great scientific movement of the second half of the nineteenth century, and of the friendship and admiration with which he was regarded by Wundt, and all of his contemporaries, disciples of Hamilton, and Spencer. Nediƒá was also influenced by the philosophical writings of Eufrosin Poteca. His part in philosophy and logic was that of a historian and commentator, for which he was especially qualified by his clarity of exposition; his point of view is one of the main Hegelian traits. Moreover, a synthesist who believes and practices synthetic methods or principles. His Die Lehre von der Quantification des Pradikats in der neueren englische Logik (Leipzig, 1885) is perhaps the most accredited modern work of its kind before the start of the 20th century. He made valuable contributions to the study of modern literary criticism, along with Svetozar Markoviƒá, Jovan Skerliƒá, Bogdan Popoviƒá, Pavle Popoviƒá, Slobodan Jovanoviƒá, and Branko Lazareviƒá. His work was quoted in Johann Eduard Erdmann's Logic and Metaphysics (1892) and Wilhelm Wundt's Textbook of Logic (1893) even before the start of the 20th century. He died at Belgrade on 29 July 1902. His Work The last years of his life were devoted chiefly as a literary critic. He aimed sharp criticism at the utilitarian theory of art espoused by the late Svetozar Markoviƒá, who accentuated the social role of literature in Realism. Quite the opposite, Nediƒá emphasized the aesthetic side of the lyric poem, using Vojislav Iliƒá's work as examples. In 1893 he founded and edited Srpski pregled, a literary review, for which he also acted as a literary and dramatic critic, and the influence of his individuality soon made itself noticed. His books in literary criticism are still being reprinted, Iz novije srpske lirike (1893), Noviji srpski pisci (1901), and Kritiƒçke studije (1910). As an academic critic educated abroad, Ljubomir Nediƒá and Bogdan Popoviƒá are responsible for the development of Serbian Modernism in prose, verse and art.

Typically the term is used for 17th century harpsichord compositions that are written without rhythm or metre indications, although various composers of the Classical music era were composing small preludes for woodwind instruments using non-measured notation well into the 19th century. The form resurfaced in the aleatory music of the 20th century, where various other aspects of performance are also left to free interpretation. Unmeasured preludes for lute The first unmeasured preludes appeared during the Renaissance era. They were short improvised compositions for lute, usually performed as an introduction to another piece of music or to test the instrument. Later unmeasured lute preludes retained the improvisatory character of the genre but became more complex and lengthy. Unmeasured preludes flourished into full-fledged compositions by the middle of the 17th century. However the development of lute music had already stopped by that time and the last surviving unmeasured lute preludes date from the end of the same century. Important lute composers who contributed to the development of the unmeasured prelude include Pierre Gaultier, Ren√© Mesangeau and Germain Pinel. Unmeasured preludes for harpsichord A sample of Louis Couperin's unique notation for unmeasured preludes. Unmeasured preludes for harpsichord started appearing around 1650. Louis Couperin is usually credited as the first composer to embrace the genre. Couperin wrote unmeasured preludes using long groups of whole notes, and these groups were connected by long curves. This kind of notation is found in Couperin's unmeasured preludes and was also done by √âlisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre. Another important contribution to the development of the genre was made by Nicolas Leb√®gue, who used diverse note values in his unmeasured preludes. The first ever published unmeasured preludes appeared in Leb√®gue's Le pieces de clavessin in 1677. The unmeasured harpsichord prelude became a typical French genre, used by many famous composers including Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jean-Henri d'Anglebert, Louis Marchand and √âlisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre. Unmeasured preludes were also present in the works of German composers who were influenced by French style. Of these, Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer was one of the first to use unmeasured preludes in harpsichord suites. One instance of unmeasured prelude by Giovanni Battista Draghi is an example of the genre in English harpsichord music. Fran√ßois Couperin's didactic L'art de toucher le clavecin (1716) contained eight preludes that, while unmeasured and improvisatory in nature, were measured for teaching purposes. These pieces, along with several preludes from Nicolas Siret's Second Livre de Pieces de Clavecin (1719), were among the last unmeasured harpsichord preludes written.

Owned by Evanov Radio Group, it broadcasts a contemporary hit radio format with a focus on the area's LGBT community. Launching on April 16, 2007, it was the first radio station in Canada targeted specifically to an LGBT audience, and the first commercial, terrestrial radio station in the world to target such an audience.PROUD FM makes history. Toronto Star, April 15, 2007. It is one of six stations in Toronto that reports to Nielsen BDS' Canadian Top 40 airplay panel.BDS monitored radio panel update Originally broadcasting from Toronto's Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, CIRR's studios are currently located on Dundas Street West in the Eatonville neighbourhood of Toronto, while its transmitter is located atop the Sheraton Centre on Queen Street West in downtown Toronto across from Toronto City Hall. History= Application and launch  The application was filed by Rainbow Media Group, a partnership between Evanov Radio Group and other private investors, in 2005, and was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on April 5, 2006. The company planned a format featuring a mix of popular and classic music (with daytime focused primarily towards current and classic hits, and evenings featuring more specialty rhythmic, dance, and world music), with spoken word programming oriented towards Toronto's LGBT community (including at least 7 hours of news programming, and 21 hours of talk/information programming per-week). The station also promised to fund a $5,000 annual scholarship to journalism, art or music students at Humber College and Carleton University, and a $30,000 stage showcase for musical artists at Toronto's Pride Week celebrations. Programming would be partially overseen by a community advisory committee.CRTC Decision 2006-128 The company first applied for this licence in 2000, but was denied in favour of Milestone Radio's CFXJ, Canada's first urban music station. Several interventions opposing the application, as well as National Post columnist Lorne Gunter,\\"Radio Free Canada\\" , National Post, April 10, 2006, reprinted by Friends of Canadian Broadcasting noted that the CRTC had not issued an open call for other applications, alleging that the application was given special treatment by the CRTC for \\"politically correct\\" reasons ‚Äî notably, Gunter directly linked the station's approval to the CRTC's denial in 2003 of a licence for a Roman Catholic radio station in Toronto, alleging religious discrimination. In the licence approval, the CRTC noted that because the proposed 103.9 frequency is second-adjacent to Evanov's own CIDC, and Evanov would therefore have to give its consent to accept a zone of radio frequency interference to its signal, the company would effectively have held a veto over any competing application for the frequency. The Catholic station, conversely, was one of eight applicants for a single frequency, 101.3, which was awarded to the multicultural station CJSA-FM. Pink Triangle Press, the publisher of the city's LGBT newspaper Xtra!, was originally a partner in the application. The company pulled out in December 2005, alleging that Evanov was using the application as a backdoor into the Toronto market ‚Äî where reception of the company's existing rhythmic contemporary station, CIDC/Orangeville is unreliable ‚Äî and intended to eventually drop the LGBT programming and convert the station to a mainstream format or rebroadcaster of CIDC. Evanov stated a commitment to serving LGBT audiences, but refused Pink Triangle's request to have the commitment reiterated in a legally binding contract.\\"Radio partners split\\", Xtra!, January 5, 2006.

In the station's early years, some listeners noted that even in the Church and Wellesley Village itself, the station's signal was sometimes drowned out by CBL-FM's rebroadcaster in Peterborough or by CKDK-FM from Woodstock.\\"Toronto's Proud FM plans to get a little louder\\" . Xtra!, March 26, 2010. In 2010, the station applied to the CRTC to increase its signal from 50 watts to 128 watts, with an ERP of 250 watts, which received CRTC approval on June 9, 2010.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-357 However, the station still broadcast from a transmitter location near Yonge and Eglinton in the Midtown region, rather than from a downtown location like most other radio stations in the city, and its signal later deteriorated even further as condominium development increased in the area.\\"Proud FM faces signal trouble\\". Toronto Star, September 7, 2012. CIRR has since relocated its transmitter to the top of the Sheraton Centre on Queen Street. In September 2011, Evanov applied to the CRTC to move CIRR to 88.1 MHz, formerly held by CKLN-FM, and to increase its transmitter power. The CRTC issued a Broadcast Notice of Consultation inviting other interested parties to apply for the frequency as well;Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2011-625 28 September 2011 by the deadline in December 2011, 27 applications had been received. Proud FM did not win the license, however, which instead was awarded to Rock 95 Broadcasting for the indie rock-formatted CIND-FM. CIRR-FM was the first commercially licensed LGBT-oriented radio station in Canada and the world. Evanov Communications was granted a license in November 2011 for a second LGBT-oriented station, a French language signal in the Montreal, Quebec market.\\"Making waves: Montreal broadcasters in flux\\". The Gazette, August 11, 2012. The station, CHRF, which was originally proposed to have launched in 2013 at the 990 AM frequency, would not begin broadcasting until February 2, 2015, after a series of delays that also included a frequency change to 980 AM.\\"Radio Fiert√© requests frequency change, one-year extension to launch,\\" from Fagstein.com, 7/25/2013 However, the format was not successful, resulting in CHRF dropping the Radio Fiert√© format on December 1, 2015 after just 10 months, switching to an adult standards format, and later shutting down in 2020 due to continued low ratings. In 2018, Evanov filed an application to swap CIRR and CIDC's frequencies and power, with a proposal to convert CIDC to a low-power station on 103.9 that would specifically serve its city of license Orangeville, and CIRR to a full-power station on 103.5 that would assume CIDC's existing CHR format, and move the existing LGBT community programming to an HD Radio subchannel. The CRTC denied the application in January 2020, citing technical restrictions, and past attempts by Evanov to relocate CIDC in a manner that would neglect its city of license, and undermine the CRTC's competitive licensing process. Programming On September 13, 2006, Evanov announced that the station's morning program would be hosted by Ken Kostick and Mary Jo Eustace, the former co-hosts of the television cooking show What's for Dinner?.\\"Gay, lesbian-targeted station hits Toronto radio dial\\".

Where it is being pursued A standardized form of Romani is used in Serbia. In Serbia's autonomous province of Vojvodina, Romani is one of the officially recognized minority languages ‚Äì having its own radio stations and news broadcasts. In Romania, the country with the largest identifiable Romani population, there is now a unified system for teaching the Romani language for all dialects spoken in the country. This is primarily a result of the work of Gheorghe SarƒÉu, who made Romani textbooks for teaching Romani children. Language standardization is presently also being pursued in the revival of the Romani language among various groups ‚Äì in Spain, Great Britain and elsewhere ‚Äì which have ceased to speak the language. In these cases, a specific dialect is not revived, but rather a standardized form derived from many dialects is developed. The Spanish politician Juan de Dios Ram√≠rez Heredia promotes Roman√≤-Kal√≤, a variant of Standard Romani with the extant Cal√≥ words inserted back,Uni√≥n Roman√≠ imparte el primer curso de roman√≤-kal√≤, 29 December 2006. aiming to both the Gitano tradition and communication with other Romani people. Standardization approaches Despite various efforts towards \\"universal\\" standardization, the overall trend in Romani literacy is towards regional codification, with some degree of international orientation, in the choice of some graphemes as well as vocabulary. This international orientation allows Romani readers to appreciate texts composed in other countries. At the same time, this pluralistic approach to codification is representative of the dispersion of Romani communities, and the lack of a central governmental authority. 'Linguistic pluralism' of this kind has been embraced as a policy by the European Roma and Traveller Forum (the elected Romani representation at the Council of Europe) in a statement on its website. It has also received the support of various leading linguists investigating Romani, such as the late Milena H√ºbschmannov√°, Dieter W. Halwachs, and Yaron Matras. The RomLex online Romani dictionary acknowledges pluralism by incorporating dialect variants, albeit in a consistent and unified spelling system. In SarƒÉu's standardization Gheorghe SarƒÉu's standardized Romani, based largely on Eastern European Romani dialects is a purified, mildly prescriptive language, choosing vocabulary and grammatical elements traced back to the old language crystallized in Anatolia. The pronunciation is most similar to that of the dialects from the first stratum. When there are more variants in the dialects, the variant that most closely resembles the oldest forms is chosen. For example, byav instead of abyav, abyau, akana instead of akanak, shunav instead of ashunav or ashunau, etc. An effort is also made to derive new words from the vocabulary already in use, i.e., xuryavno (airplane), vortorin (slide rule), palpaledikhipnasko (retrospectively), pashnavni (adjective). There is an ever-changing set of borrowings from Romanian as well, including such terms as vremea (weather, time), primariya (town hall), frishka (cream), sf√Ønto (saint, holy). Neologisms taken from Hindi include bijli (bulb, electricity), misal (example), chitro (drawing, design), lekhipen (writing) and from English (printisarel, prezidento).

This‚Äîfirst of the two Canadian film magazines entitled Take One‚Äîgave due attention to the newly emerging Canadian film scene, but was international in scope. Description It was inexpensive (initially 25 cents a copy), and aimed to publish bi- monthly‚Äîa goal which it rarely achieved. The magazine attracted some of the best film journalists of the time (including Time magazine reviewer Jay Cocks, James Monaco [author of the standard textbook, How to Read a Film], Alanna Nash, and the Montreal cartoonists Terry Mosher and Vittorio Fiorucci) -- and often filmmakers themselves (including Brian DePalma and Richard Dreyfuss, who met Lebensold while he was filming The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz in and around Montreal). Symansky and Roston having left after an issue or two, Lebensold carried on alone as Editor and Publisher. Joe Medjuck (later to become a producer in Hollywood working with Ivan Reitman) was another McGill Film Society alumnus who became involved with the magazine‚Äîinitially as a Toronto \\"correspondent\\", and then as co-Editor/Publisher. For most of its life under Lebensold's editorship, the magazine was designed by Montreal graphic artist Gerry l'Orange. This, first, Take One continued briefly to publish after the departure (about 1977) of founder Peter Lebensold, under the editorship of Phyllis Platt (later a Vice President of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and television-program producer) but folded shortly afterwards, in 1979, after 81 issues. Reflecting the magazine's broad cinematic scope, notable issues of this Take One included a special on Alfred Hitchcock (with contributions from photographer Philippe Halsman, director Peter Bogdanovich, actress Ingrid Bergman and many others) ... and issues that featured long cover essays by Alanna Nash on filmmaker D.W. Griffith (1974) and actress Jean Muir (1977.) Take One: Film & Television in Canada Published subsequently (in Toronto, and with no connection to the above), Take One: Film & Television in Canada (1992-2006) (, ) is a former magazine which was published in Canada. Although it shares the name with the original Take One, Take One: Film and Television in Canada was a separate publication with no connection to its predecessor. Description And unlike the original, its focus was entirely Canadian. When its founder, Wyndham Wise ‚Äì a student of Joe Medjuck when Medjuck taught film studies at Innis College, University of Toronto in the early 1970s ‚Äì launched the magazine in the fall of 1992, he called Joe in Los Angeles to ask permission to use the name. Medjuck gave permission, but said it would ‚Äòconfuse librarians.‚Äô He was right. With no government or institutional support, at first Take One: Film and Television in Canada was published irregularly. When it did eventually receive support from the Ontario Arts Council and Canada Council, it went quarterly in 1996 and for a brief period in the early 2000s it was published five times a year. It folded in the spring of 2006 after 52 issues and three special issues. The magazine was published by a non-profit organization, the Canadian Independent Film & Television Publishing Association, and Wyndham Wise served as the publisher and editor-in-chief. Over the span of its publishing history, contributing editors included Marc Glassman, Tom McSorley, Maurie Alioff and Cynthia Amsden. It built a reputation as Canada‚Äôs finest and most influential film magazine, offering criticism, articles, reviews and interviews and, most notably, significant contributions to the discourse on Canada cinema. Issue No. 12, Summer 1996 was devoted to 100 Years of Canadian Cinema and included a major essay by Geoff Pevere: ‚ÄúGhostbusting: 100 Years of Canadian Cinema or Why My Canada Includes The Terminator‚Äù; No. 22, Winter 1998 included Wyndham Wise‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúCanadian Cinema from Boom to Bust: The Tax-Shelter Years‚Äù; and issue No. 28, Summer 2000 contained Cameron Bailey‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Secret History of the Toronto New Wave.‚Äù In 2001 (which coined the phrase the Toronto New Wave), the University of Toronto Press published Take One‚Äôs Essential Guide to Canadian Film, the most comprehensive book of its kind since Peter Morris‚Äôs The Film Companion (1984). In 2006, the magazine ceased publication and the Take One digital archives were transferred to Northern Stars.

Location In the view of modern researchers, the ancient builders of Dzibilchalt√∫n may have chosen the site of the city to be as close as possible to the coastal salt-producing region (about away), while still being located on a reasonably fertile and habitable terrain. The region between Dzibilchalt√∫n and the sea coast is less suitable for human habitation, being either mangrove swamps or bare rock.  Overview  The site has been continuously occupied for thousands of years, although it has expanded and contracted from mid-sized city to small town more than once in its long history. It is about 30 minutes north of M√©rida, and about the same distance south of the location of the impact site of the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs.  Architecture  The most famous structure is the Temple of the Seven Dolls, so named because of seven small effigies found at the site when the temple was discovered under the ruins of a later temple pyramid by archaeologists in the 1950s. On the vernal equinox, the site is crowded by visitors observing the sunrise through the temple's doorways, but there is no archaeological feature marking the observation spot; the relationship of the orientation with the equinoxes is thus highly unlikely. The temple is connected to the rest of the site by a sacbe, or \\"white road,\\" so-called because they were originally coated with white limestone, built over stone- and-rubble fill.  Surroundings  The other major feature of Dzibilchalt√∫n is its cenote, Cenote Xlakah, located around the center of the city's ruins. It is thought that the availability of this source of clean drinking water influenced the builders' choice of the location. Archaeological findings retrieved from the cenote by divers indicate that it was the center of a religious cult. These days the cenote is used as a swimming hole by local residents and tourists year round. In this Cenote, just like the one found in Chichen Itza, a large number of archaeological pieces like carved bones and wooden objects, but mainly vases, have been found. Valuable information about the ancient Mayans who lived near the cenote was found here. Dzibilchalt√∫n also contains the ruin of a 16th-century Spanish church built at the site after the conquest. The Dzibilchaltun archeological site also includes a visitor center with maps, restrooms and gift shops. The renovated museum housing Mayan artifacts located at the site has re-opened. The museum is closed on Mondays.

The \\"Sassi\\" have been described by Fodor's as \\"one of the most unique landscapes in Europe\\".Fodor's Southern Italy, Fodor's Travel, 22 march 2011 Along with the park of the Rupestrian Churches, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. History View from the Canyon (Gravina) The Sassi originate from a prehistoric troglodyte settlement and are suspected to be among the first human settlements in Italy. There is evidence that people were living here as early as the year 7000 BC. The Sassi are houses dug into the calcarenitic rock itself, which is characteristic of Basilicata and Apulia, locally called \\"tufo\\" although it is not volcanic tuff or tufa. The streets in some parts of the Sassi often run on top of other houses. The ancient town grew up on one slope of the ravine created by a river that is now a small stream. The ravine is known locally as \\"la Gravina\\". The term sasso derives from Latin saxum, meaning a hill, rock or great stone. In the 1950s, the government of Italy forcefully relocated most of the population of the Sassi to areas of the developing modern city. Beset by extreme poverty and riddled with malaria, the unhealthy living conditions were considered inhuman and an affront to the modern new Italian Republic of Alcide De Gasperi.Dennis Marks, speaking on the series Appian Way, BBC Radio 3 However, people continued to live in the Sassi, and according to the English Fodor's guide: Until the late 1980s this was considered an area of poverty, since many of these houses were, and in some cases still are, uninhabitable. The current local administration, however, has become more tourism-oriented, and it has promoted the regeneration of the Sassi with the aid of the European Union, the government, UNESCO. Today there are many thriving businesses, pubs, and hotels there, as described in an April 2015 article in The New Yorker. Geography The \\"Sassi\\" grew in the area of Murgia Plateau, extended between Apulia and Basilicata. Along with the \\"Civita\\" and the \\"Piano\\", the two Sassi form Matera's Old Town. Culture Sassi with snow (December 2007) The Sassi are visually reminiscent of ancient sites in and around Jerusalem, and for this reason they have been used in many Christian-themed films, including The Gospel According to St. Matthew (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1964), The Passion of the Christ (Mel Gibson, 2004), The Nativity Story (Catherine Hardwicke, 2006) and Ben-Hur (Timur Bekmambetov, 2016).

The recording features both studio and live tracks, which are interspersed with one another throughout the album. It is perhaps the group's most popular live album, because Lotus did not receive a U.S. domestic release until 1991. It displays a mix between the fusion of Latin and blues-rock styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the much more experimental and spiritual jazz fusion sound that characterized the band's mid-1970s work. The live material was recorded during the supporting tour for the Amigos album. A cover version of the Zombies' mid-1960s hit song \\"She's Not There\\" was released as a single and peaked at #27. The song was the first Santana recording to hit the Top 40 of the Billboard charts since \\"No One to Depend On\\" reached #36 in 1972. The album reached #10 on the Billboard charts and was eventually certified platinum, neither of which occurred again until the star-studded Supernatural in 1999.

He specialized in elasmobranchs and published many books and articles about shark and ray biology. In 1982, he published a thorough taxonomy on sharks of the genus Carcharhinus, where he identified the smoothtooth blacktip shark as a new species. He is the species authority for several types of sharks, including the New Zealand lanternshark. Garrick was a zoology professor at Victoria University of Wellington, appointed to a personal chair in 1971. He had a primary interest in the taxonomy of sharks and rays, and carried out the first exploratory deep-sea sampling using specially adapted cone nets, baited traps, and longlines, regularly to depths greater than 2000 m. Many new and rare species were obtained by use of these innovative techniques. He was responsible for the notable discovery of the first New Zealand specimens of orange roughy in 1957 (which subsequently formed the basis of a multimillion-dollar fishery).

Competitive career Kilkenny was named after the area in which he was bred ‚Äì County Kilkenny, Ireland. His breeder was William Dempsey of Ballyhale. Kilkenny was first ridden by an Irish rider, Tommy Brennan, with whom he competed at the 1964 Badminton Horse Trials and in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In 1965, he turned briefly to show jumping, becoming a member of the Irish Show Jumping Team and competing at the Rotterdam CSI, jumping 6'7\\" in a puissance class. He was ridden again in the 1966 Badminton Horse Trials and then at the 1966 Eventing World Championship at Burghley, where he won team gold. Wofford saw the horse running at the World Championships and was impressed by his bravery. His mother purchased Kilkenny that winter, and gave Wofford the ride. Under Wofford, Kilkenny continued to have great success, first winning the 1967 USET Nationals, before earning the team gold at the Pan-American Games and finishing 4th individually. In 1968, the pair competed at Badminton for a third time, placing 13th. A few months later they finished 8th at the Canadian Championships, before shipping off to the 1968 Olympics. The Olympics was a success, earning a team silver medal for the Americans. However, a broken caulk in the show jumping resulted in a fall, and disappointedly dropped the pair from second individually down to sixth. The pair continued finishing well, placing 3rd at the 1969 USET Championships, and winning the bronze medal at the 1970 World Championships in Puncheston. In 1971, Kilkenny finished third at the Canadian Chanmpionships, and finished his competitive career at the 1972 Olympic Games, with a team silver medal. Following his third Olympics, Kilkenny was retired at Ledyard, and carried Wofford out fox hunting for 6 years.

Other publications  Al-Ahari has published more than twenty books on Islam and American Muslim history through the Chicago-based Magribine Press. Most of these texts are reprints of early American Muslim texts rather than his original writings. His work through Magribine press is important due to the preservation of scholarly editions of early American Mslim texts. His works on Muhammad Alexander Russell Webb and Five Classic Muslim Slave Narratives have been used in Muslim book clubs (at the Light of Islam Bookstore in Houston, Texas, and other places), and as supplementary texts and textbooks in several university-level classes on Islam in America. DePaul University's archives in Chicago house his papers. His original writings have been translated into Arabic, Bosnian, Albanian, and Turkish. In the 1980s Muhammed started to write about the history of Islam in America, with several articles in the California-based Muslim periodical Minaret. In the late 1980s while in South Carolina he started Magribine Press, which published a catalogue of Arabic Slave Narratives written in America and the single-issue periodical Meditations from the Bilali Muhammad Research Society. When Muhammed returned to Chicago in 1990, he attended the American Islamic College for two additional years and restarted his Magribine Press with an edited edition of Muhammed Alexander Rusell Webb's Islam in America (1993), an edited edition of Shaykh Daoud's al-Islam, the True Faith of Humanity (2003), and his translation of the Fiqh text called the Ben Ali Diary or the Bilali Document, written by Bilali Muhammad of Sapelo Island, Georgia.Dr. Ronald Judy (1993). (Dis)forming the American Canon: African-Arabic slave narratives, p. 323, documents Muhammed al-Ahari's translation of Arabic slave narratives and his work on the Bilali Muhammad text. The second edition of Allan Austin's African Muslims in Antebellum America: Ttransatlantic Stories and Spiritual Struggles (1997) includes translations from Muhammed al-Ahari and thanks Muhammed for locating five manuscripts that were not in the first edition. In 2005 Muhammed continued his work of reprinting edited, annotated editions of early American Muslim texts with the 100 Seeds of Beirut ‚Äî The Neglected Poetic Utterances of Warren Tartaglia (Walid al-Taha), and the collected writings of Shaykh Kamil Avdich -- A Heritage of East and West (2006). Since then Muhammed has reprinted over 20 texts of early America Muslim writers and has published his own original works that includes a study of Bosnian American and other Ottoman Diaspora newspapers, a study of Freemasonry and Islam, and a forthcoming history of Islam in America.

This is a collection of five slave narratives that are either out of print or difficult to find. The presentation of Africa, Islam and slavery in the American slave Narratives of Muslim slaves in the Americas is a topic that is often overlooked in discussing the genre of slave narratives and the birth of African-American literature. In fact the first biography was that of a former Maryland slave, Job Ben Solomon, published in 1730 in Britain. By reexamining these often overlooked narratives we can get insight into African Islam, the turmoil of integration into a foreign culture, life in Africa, and life as a slave in the Americas. The primary sources include: the narrative of Job ben Solomon, the two autobiographical pieces of Muhammad Said of Bornu, the Arabic autobiography of 'Umar ibn Said, the Jamaican narrative of Abu Bakr Said, a discussion of coverage on Bilali Muhammad's excerpts from the Risalah of Abi Zaid, Theodore Dwight's articles on the teaching methods of the Serachule teacher slave Lamen Kebe, and a letter describing Salih Bilali.

Overview The basis of ferroics is to understand the large changes in physical characteristics that occur over a very narrow temperature range. The changes in physical characteristics occur when phase transitions take place around some critical temperature value, normally denoted by T_c. Above this critical temperature, the crystal is in a nonferroic state and does not exhibit the physical characteristic of interest. Upon cooling the material down below T_c it undergoes a spontaneous phase transition. Such a phase transition typically results in only a small deviation from the nonferroic crystal structure, but in altering the shape of the unit cell the point symmetry of the material is reduced. This breaking of symmetry is physically what allows the formation of the ferroic phase. In ferroelectrics, upon lowering the temperature below T_c, a spontaneous dipole moment is induced along an axis of the unit cell. Although individual dipole moments can sometimes be small, the effect of 10^{24} unit cells gives rise to an electric field that over the bulk substance that is not insignificant. An important point about ferroelectrics is that they cannot exist in a centrosymmetric crystal. A centrosymmetric crystal is one where a lattice point \\\\left (x,y,z \\\\right ) can be mapped onto a lattice point \\\\left ( -x,-y,-z \\\\right ). Ferromagnets is a term that most people are familiar with, and, as with ferroelastics, the spontaneous magnetization of a ferromagnet can be attributed to a breaking of point symmetry in switching from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. In this case, T_c is normally known as the Curie Temperature. In ferroelastic crystals, in going from the nonferroic (or prototypic phase) to the ferroic phase, a spontaneous strain is induced. An example of a ferroelastic phase transition is when the crystal structure spontaneously changes from a tetragonal structure (a square prism shape) to a monoclinic structure (a general parallelepiped). Here the shapes of the unit cell before and after the phase transition are different, and hence a strain is induced within the bulk. In recent years a new class of ferroic materials has been attracting increased interest. These multiferroics exhibit more than one ferroic property simultaneously in a single phase.

It used to be the city's Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) station, and served as the headquarters of CPR from 1889 to 1996. It is bordered by Avenue des Canadiens-de-Montr√©al to the north, Peel Street to the east, Saint Antoine Street to the south and the Bell Centre to the west. Windsor Station was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1975, and was designated a Heritage Railway Station in 1990, and a provincial historic monument in 2009. The walls are gray limestone from a quarry in Montreal. Outside, the columns reach up to wide. History Windsor Station circa 1900 In 1887, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) began to build a railway station in Montreal, which would serve as its headquarters, three years after the completion of the Dalhousie Station in 1884. The Windsor Station project was entrusted to New York City architect Bruce Price, who chose a Romanesque Revival style for the building. Price had to submit four versions of his plans to satisfy the treasurer of CPR, before the project was accepted. It was constructed at a cost of $300,000 CAD, and the first trains departed February 4, 1889.The Railway Hotels and the Development of the Chateau Style in Canada. Harold D. Kalman, Morriss Publishing, Victoria BC, 1968. It was known as the Windsor Street Station, named for the street on which it was located, Windsor Street (today Peel Street). It was expanded for the first time from 1900 to 1903, and again from 1910 to 1913 by Canadian architects. The third expansion, in 1916, included a fifteen-storey tower which dramatically altered Montreal's skyline. The project was entrusted to the firm of brothers Edward and William Maxwell. Windsor Station formed an integral component of Dominion Square as a diffuser of passenger traffic and as a central terminus for other modes of transportation. The building skirted Windsor Street (today Peel Street) and Osborne Street (today Avenue des Canadiens-de-Montr√©al) between Donegani (located halfway between Osborne Street and Saint Antoine Street). The building had four floors up to Osborne Street and five floors at street-level on Donegani Street because of the slope of the terrain. Delaware and Hudson's Montreal Limited at Windsor Station on August 27, 1970 In July 1970, CPR announced its plans to demolish Windsor Station and build a 60-storey office building on the site. The building, which was going to cost C$250 million, was to be designed by the same architects as New York City's World Trade Center. After several delays the project was abandoned. Via Rail was created in 1978 and took over the responsibility for operating intercity passenger trains of both Canadian National CN and CPR. During Via's first months there was no operational change for CPR or CN trains, as they used their respective crews, routes, equipment and stations. However, by the summer of 1979, the integration process began, and most of Via's former CP trains that used Windsor Station were consolidated at CN's Central Station, including CP's former transcontinental passenger services such as The Atlantic Limited and The Canadian, both of which were also renamed to be bilingually appropriate. Via Dayliners (Budd Rail Diesel Cars) operating between Windsor Station and St. Sacrement station in Quebec City via the CP route north of the St. Lawrence River continued to use Windsor Station until 1984. Amtrak's daily Montreal-New York City train (the Adirondack) continued to use Windsor Station until 1986. Both the dayliners and the Adirondack were switched to Central Station. Local services to Ottawa via Montebello and to Mont-Laurier, both of which had been transferred from CPR to Via, continued to use Windsor Station until they were cancelled in 1981. Entrance to Windsor Station in 2008 After intercity passenger service was removed, Windsor Station continued to be a commuter rail terminal for the STCUM's (now the RTM's) Montr√©al/Dorion-Rigaud suburban train (now Vaudreuil-Hudson line). In 1999, service to Blainville (now Saint-J√©r√¥me line) was added, and in 2001, service to Delson (now Candiac line). In 1993, construction began on the Molson Centre (now Bell Centre), a hockey arena to replace the Montreal Forum. The arena site was located immediately west of Windsor Station on the trackage which served the station platforms, resulting in the historic station being severed from the rail network. The Molson Centre opened its doors on March 16, 1996, and the new Lucien-L'Allier Station was opened at the western end of the arena structure to replace the now-closed suburban train terminal at Windsor Station. Until 2001, the new train station was called Terminus Windsor, but this was changed to reduce confusion with the original station building and to indicate a link to the Lucien-L'Allier metro (subway) station which is below the station building. It is still possible to walk through the Bell Centre to connect with Windsor Station and the Lucien L'Allier metro station. Windsor Station, and now Lucien-L'Allier Station (known in French as 'Terminus Lucien-L'Allier'), are at the eastern end of CPR's Westmount Subdivision. It served as CP's downtown west end train terminus. Its counterpart downtown east end terminus was Place Viger. Windsor Station also housed the headquarters of CPR and its parent company Canadian Pacific Limited until after a corporate restructuring in the mid-1990s, the railway abandoned or sold most of its trackage east of Montreal, and it focused its activities in Western Canada. In 1996, CP moved its headquarters to Gulf Canada Square in Calgary. Windsor Station's main concourse as a party venue, August 2017 Today Public park, with Wikipedians Since 1993, the structure is no longer connected to the rail network. It was sold by CP to Cadillac Fairview in 2009 (thus removing it from the jurisdiction of the Heritage Railway Stations Act; consequently, it was classified as a provincial heritage site that same year). Also located in the station is the Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration. The rest of Windsor Station has been redeveloped into an office complex and houses some restaurants and caf√©s. The interior concourse, which is open to the public, can be rented for private and public events. The lower floor is part of the R√âSO and connects the Bonaventure metro station with the Lucien-L'Allier commuter rail station as well as the Bell Centre. The 13 terminal tracks running into Windsor Station and the overhead canopy have been removed, and replaced by a public square.

It was released in 1978 and marks the start of the phase of Santana's career where he moved away from the fusion of Latin, jazz, rock and blues that marked his previous records and began to move towards an album-oriented rock direction.

Tallulah Gorge State Park is a Georgia state park adjacent to Tallulah Falls, Georgia, along the county line between Rabun and Habersham Counties. The park surrounds Tallulah Gorge, a deep gorge formed by the action of the Tallulah River, which runs along the floor of the gorge. The major attractions of the gorge are the six waterfalls known as the Tallulah Falls, which cause the river to drop 500 feet over one mile (150 m over 1.6 km).Georgia State Parks ‚Äì Histories. Georgia State Parks. Retrieved 18 October 2011. History Although Tallulah Gorge State Park was not established until 1993 under Georgia governor Zell Miller as a result of cooperation with Georgia Power, there were discussions as early as 1905 regarding the establishment of a park at Tallulah Gorge. Tourism intensified in 1882 with the completion of a railroad later called the Tallulah Falls Railroad which brought thousands of people a week to the area. Additionally, when Georgia Power began building a series of hydroelectric dams along the original course of the Tallulah River, efforts to establish a park intensified. Helen Dortch Longstreet, widow of Confederate General James Longstreet, led an unsuccessful campaign in 1911 to have Tallulah Gorge protected by the state. Area Tallulah Gorge is bounded upstream by a hydroelectric dam operated by Georgia Power. Normally, the river flows much lower than the historical flow. Large releases of water are typically scheduled for kayaking and whitewater rafting on the first two weekends of April and the first three weekends of November. Additional aesthetic water releases are scheduled for weekends in the spring and fall to allow visitors to see what the natural flow of the river would look like in the gorge.Tallulah Gorge State Park.

The name Carty is likely to have originated from the Irish name √ì C√°rthaigh or O'Coraic. It took its current form 'Carty' during later historical events when many Gaelic Irish names were Anglicised. The names Carthy and McCarty may sometimes have derived from the name Carty. Carty is pronounced , whereas Carthy is pronounced . It has been speculated that some Irish immigrants to America and/or their descendants added 'Mc', changing their names to McCarty in the incorrect belief that they were returning the name back to its original form. The Irish is in Connacht and Ulster, and in Munster. The Carty name originates from the south of the island of Ireland Wexford and could have been a subclan of the much larger Mac / Mc Carthyclan, and a member of the Clan Eoghanachta. It has been recorded that the Carty clan was a scattered sept or clan in pre Norman Ireland which may have resulted from an event such as having come off the wrong end of a tribal dispute. Carty settlements can be found across Ireland sometimes in locations that were easy to defend such as Sligo's Coney Island which hosts the remains of a small Carty settlement (Carty's Town & Carty's beach). Carty is a common name today in the Irish counties of: Wexford, Cork, Sligo, Galway and Roscommon. It is common in Longford under the spelling of Carthy until the last thirty years. Carty is recorded amongst the Irish travelling (tinker) community. There may also be an English version of the name Carty which could be derived from the English name Cartwright. Nicholas Le Poer Trench, 9th Earl of Clancarty, 8th Marquess of Heusden (born 1 May 1952) is an Irish peer, as well a nobleman in the Dutch nobility. He served as an elected Crossbench member of the British House of Lords.  Cartys outside Ireland  In Montserrat, Carty is a common name, due to the Irish settlers on the Island, and some of the African slaves taking the name, which was a common occurrence at the time. The same is true in Anguilla, there are still European descendants on the island as well as those of African descent. In 1873, Paul Carty emigrated with his family from Sligo, Ireland to Canada in order to take up the position of Chief Inspector of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. Cartyville is named after his son Michael H. Carty who went on to become a famous Newfoundland lawyer and politician.  Cartys in County Down in Elizabethan times  According to an Elizabethan map of the 1500s, Carty was an important name in the Ards peninsula in Down in the 1500s.

The party was founded by supermarket tycoon Francisco Javier Err√°zuriz to support his candidacy in the 1989 presidential elections. The charismatic Err√°zuriz claimed that he was the only true centrist candidate, although his political ideology was slightly center-right. Err√°zuriz won 15.05% of the vote, but achieved little politically except to take votes from the right-wing candidate, Hern√°n B√ºchi. The UCC then joined the right-wing alliance Union for Progress (Uni√≥n por el Progreso, later the Alliance for Chile). Due to disagreements between the UCC and the National Renewal, one of the members of the Union for Progress, the UCC broke with the alliance on 1995 and presented their own candidate, Arturo Frei, for the 1999 presidential elections. Frei fared disastrously, gaining only 0.35% of the vote, the lowest percentage of any candidate since the end of the Pinochet r√©gime. On January 3, 2000, Senator Err√°zuriz retook control of the UCC from Alejandro Garc√≠a and Agust√≠n Benapres after they gave their support for Joaqu√≠n Lav√≠n in the 2000 runoff election. Many accused Err√°zuriz of wanting to be in charge of the party when it had formally given its support to Lav√≠n so that he would be rewarded with a post in the Lav√≠n government. Err√°zuriz, the only UCC member of Parliament, soon saw himself embroiled in various court cases. His term ended on 2000 and he decided to end his career in politics due to the court cases against him, the investigation into some of his companies, and the fact that three of them were bankrupt.

It was developed by Office Create and published by Taito, Majesco Entertainment, and 505 Games. It was awarded IGN's \\"Best Of E3\\" award for 2006. It is the start of the Cooking Mama series, with 4 more main series titles on DS and Nintendo 3DS, two spin offs on Wii, and a spin off on 3DS. It also spins off into the Gardening Mama series. For later titles in the series, the publishers and Office Create joined together to form Cooking Mama Limited, which was made exclusively to develop the Cooking Mama series. Gameplay In Cooking Mama, the player is tasked with cooking various meals using the device's touch screen. Following the instructions of the titular \\"Mama\\", the player uses the stylus or their finger to perform different kitchen tasks, including chopping vegetables, slicing meat, flipping food in pans, and arranging the final items on the plate. The version of the game for iOS also takes advantage of the accelerometer in its devices with some similar gameplay to Cooking Mama: Cook Off. Each of these tasks is performed by completing a mini-game which usually lasts less than 10 seconds. The gameplay structure consists of the player progressing through a series of short minigames. The game features a total of 96 different dishes. Each minigame represents a different activity in the meal preparation, such as mixing, frying, or chopping the provided ingredients. The minigame mechanics themselves range from quickly drawing parallel lines in order to chop items, to a rhythm game where ingredients are added to a skillet or the heat is adjusted at precisely the right time. In many cases, players must look at the top screen of the DS for guidance on what to do next and then perform the task on the bottom screen. If the player makes a serious blunder or time expires without sufficient progress being made, that step in the cooking process is considered a failure. When this happens, a graphic of an angry \\"Mama\\" with flames erupting from her eyes is displayed, along with the caption \\"Don't worry, Mama will fix it!\\". Completing a dish can require playing one minigame, or as many as a dozen. The player's performance is rated when each dish is finished, based on the average result of each minigame. Depending on the final score, the game may award the player a bronze, silver or gold medal. The highest medal earned for each dish is recorded and displayed next to each item on the selection screen. A screenshot of the \\"Let's Cook\\" mode, where a player is cutting a tomato for a dish Game modes=Let's Cook The main game mode where players cook dishes. Players initially start with just a few simple recipes to choose from, with additional recipes unlocked as the earlier ones are mastered. Each recipe requires players to play through a short, timed minigame for each ingredient or group of ingredients. For example, to make a sandwich, the player would first be required to chop a cucumber into slices before the time limit elapses. When cooking a recipe which has previously been mastered, the player sometimes has the option to change the dish being made \\"on the fly\\" between two minigames. If completed, this new recipe is then unlocked for future play. A player also has a choice to practice a recipe. Let's Combine In this mode, players can take the recipes which have been unlocked and combine them to make something new. For example, the \\"Fried Eggs\\" recipe can be combined with the \\"Rice\\" recipe to make an entree. Use Skill In this mode, players put their minigaming ingredients, peeling, stewing, tearing, and more to the test. The player is ranked at the end of each task. Reception The DS version received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four sevens, for a total of 28 out of 40. 411Mania gave it a score of 7.5 out of 10, saying that \\"At $19.99 this makes yet another quality and affordable title for the Nintendo DS library.\\" Detroit Free Press also gave it a score of three stars out of four, calling it \\"a game best played in small bursts. It's perfect for waiting in line or during road trips.\\" However, The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a score of three stars out of five and said it was \\"A lot of fun but unlikely to satisfy your gaming appetite.\\" The original Cooking Mama sold more than 500,000 copies in the United States as of August 15, 2007, and sold more than 1 million copies in PAL regions. It received a \\"Double Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. As of January 30, 2008, the Cooking Mama series sold more than 2.6 million copies worldwide. Majesco also credited it, among other games, for an increase in revenue in early 2007. By May 2009, over four million copies of the series were sold in North America. Miley Cyrus was found to be a huge fan of the game, and even gained a large number of fans due to how much she enjoys it. Criticism The animal welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) created a Flash game titled Cooking Mama: Mama Kills Animals intended to both criticize the video game's use of meat-based recipes and to encourage veganism. The creators of Cooking Mama responded to PETA in a press release stating that \\"I would never put rat in my ratatouille\\", and indicated that not all of Mama's recipes are meat-based. PETA stated that they were happy with the release of Gardening Mama, a spin-off of the series.

It was the directorial debut of screenwriter Tom Schulman. In 1998 the film won the Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Film's Silver Raven award. Plot Tommy Spinelli (Joe Pesci) is a wiseguy hired by Benny and Rico, a pair of dimwitted hit men, to transport a duffel bag full of severed heads across the United States to a crime boss (as proof of the deaths). While on a commercial flight, his bag is accidentally switched with that of Charlie Pritchett (Andy Comeau), a friendly, talkative, young American tourist who is going to Mexico to see his girlfriend Laurie (Kristy Swanson) and her parents (George Hamilton and Dyan Cannon). The film revolves around Spinelli harassing Charlie's friends Ernie (David Spade) and Steve (Todd Louiso) for information, while Charlie and Laurie attempt to get rid of their rather unfortunate luggage. After Charlie meets with Laurie and her parents at the airport with the wrong bag, they go to their rooms at the resort in Acapulco, Mexico. Soon, Annette, Laurie's mom, mistakenly thinks that Charlie might be a serial killer on the run once she sees a head in his bag while hiding a gift for him inside the bag. Her husband thinks it's all a delusion brought on by her alcoholism. At first, Charlie and Laurie tried to bury the heads in the desert, but a group of thugs steals their car. Then Charlie comes up with an idea that he will give back the heads without anyone noticing, by pretending he forgot to turn in his report back at his college. In turn, everyone packs up for the airport. At the airport, Charlie accidentally puts a severed head in Dick's carry-on bag, causing him to get arrested. They never leave Acapulco since they have to come up with a new plan to save Dick. Meanwhile, Tommy, Ernie, and Steve start to look for replacement heads, after Charlie tells Tommy he lost one. They start to look in a cryonics lab, where they store bodies and severed heads, much to Tommy's approval. After getting the replacement heads, Tommy and the others get on a plane and head to Mexico. Tommy threatens Charlie that if he loses more heads, he'll replace them with Charlie's friends and family. After hearing of the airport incident, Benny and Rico decide to collect the heads for themselves. When Fern, Dick's mother, arrives in Mexico, Tommy takes her and the others hostage as he helps Charlie find more heads. They find out that a coyote took one of the heads from the stolen car. Tommy also realizes that Benny and Rico are going to kill him if he doesn't get the heads across the border in time. Charlie comes up with a plan to save both their lives. The film ends when Charlie and Laurie take a severed head to the airport to prove her father's innocence. Benny and Rico try to intervene, but end up getting arrested. It is revealed that Tommy and Charlie set them up. Charlie thanks him for his help, as Tommy departs to Hawaii. Steve goes insane and starts running around the airport, telling security guards that a severed head is his \\"best friend\\". Charlie and Laurie get married, with her mother and father present, Steve is in a straitjacket, Ernie is a brain surgeon, Fern is also present after being thrown out of a moving van when she started to bad-mouth Tommy, and Tommy is enjoying his retirement.

Nicholas Fargnoli, Michael Patrick Gillespie. James Joyce A to Z. Oxford University Press, 1995. Page 60. and published in his 1914 collection Dubliners. Plot summary The story begins with an unconscious man who has fallen down the stairs in a pub after heavy drinking. A friend of his, Mr. Power, finds him, reveals him to be named Tom Kernan, and takes him home to his wife. Kernan is a salesman who once possessed an easy charm and manner but has since descended into alcoholism. An injury to his tongue sustained during the fall keeps Kernan in bed. Two days later, he is visited by his friends Power, M‚ÄôCoy, and Cunningham. The friends have concocted a plan to get Kernan to attend a Catholic retreat with them. The four discuss many matters and finally settle upon religion. The friends mention going to a confessional retreat at a Jesuit church and invite Kernan along. He does not respond to the idea at first. The conversation shows a superficial understanding of faith, and the friends make many comical errors about the church. The scene shifts to the Jesuit church in Gardiner Street where all are listening to a priest‚Äôs shallow, businesslike sermonizing.  Analysis  Kernan's gin-drinking in the novel \\"Ulysses\\" (which is set on 16 June 1904) indicates the failure of his friends' plan.

Tests selected and desired test results vary with the intended use or discharge location. Tests measure physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the waste water. Tests will determine the quality of this wastewater. Physical characteristics=Temperature Aquatic organisms cannot survive outside of specific temperature ranges. Irrigation runoff and water cooling of power stations may elevate temperatures above the acceptable range for some species. Elevated temperature can also cause an algae bloom which reduces oxygen levels. (See thermal pollution.) Temperature may be measured with a calibrated thermometer.Franson, Mary Ann Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater 14th edition (1975) APHA, AWWA & WPCF Solids Solid material in wastewater may be dissolved, suspended, or settled. Total dissolved solids or TDS (sometimes called filterable residue) is measured as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of filtered water is evaporated. The mass of dried solids remaining on the filter is called total suspended solids (TSS) or nonfiltrable residue. Settleable solids are measured as the visible volume accumulated at the bottom of an Imhoff cone after water has settled for one hour. Turbidity is a measure of the light scattering ability of suspended matter in the water. Salinity measures water density or conductivity changes caused by dissolved materials. Chemical characteristics Virtually any chemical may be found in water, but routine testing is commonly limited to a few chemical elements of unique significance. Hydrogen Water ionizes into hydronium (H3O) cations and hydroxyl (OH) anions. The concentration of ionized hydrogen (as protonated water) is expressed as pH. Oxygen Most aquatic habitats are occupied by fish or other animals requiring certain minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations to survive. Dissolved oxygen concentrations may be measured directly in wastewater, but the amount of oxygen potentially required by other chemicals in the wastewater is termed as oxygen demand. Dissolved or suspended oxidizable organic material in wastewater will be used as a food source. Finely divided material is readily available to microorganisms whose populations will increase to digest the amount of food available. Digestion of this food requires oxygen, so the oxygen content of the water will ultimately be decreased by the amount required to digest the dissolved or suspended food. Oxygen concentrations may fall below the minimum required by aquatic animals if the rate of oxygen utilization exceeds replacement by atmospheric oxygen.Goldman, Charles R. & Horne, Alexander J. Limnology (1983) McGraw-Hill p.111 Basically, the reaction for biochemical oxidation may be written as: :Oxidizable material + bacteria + nutrient + O2 ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ H2O + oxidized inorganics such as NO3‚àí or SO42‚àí Oxygen consumption by reducing chemicals such as sulfides and nitrites is typified as follows: :S2‚àí \\\\+ 2 O2 ‚Üí SO42‚àí :NO2‚àí \\\\+ ¬Ω O2 ‚Üí NO3‚àí Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrient, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above). Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Oxidizable chemicals (such as reducing chemicals) introduced into a natural water will similarly initiate chemical reactions (such as shown above). Those chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen- depletion effect of a waste contaminant. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of pollution effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants plus the oxygen demand of non-biodegradable oxidizable pollutants. The so-called 5-day BOD measures the amount of oxygen consumed by biochemical oxidation of waste contaminants in a 5-day period. The total amount of oxygen consumed when the biochemical reaction is allowed to proceed to completion is called the Ultimate BOD. Because the Ultimate BOD is so time consuming, the 5-day BOD has been almost universally adopted as a measure of relative pollution effect. There are also many different COD tests of which the 4-hour COD is probably the most common. There is no generalized correlation between the 5-day BOD and the ultimate BOD. Similarly there is no generalized correlation between BOD and COD. It is possible to develop such correlations for specific waste contaminants in a specific wastewater stream but such correlations cannot be generalized for use with any other waste contaminants or wastewater streams. This is because the composition of any wastewater stream is different. As an example an effluent consisting of a solution of simple sugars that might discharge from a confectionery factory is likely to have organic components that degrade very quickly. In such a case, the 5 day BOD and the ultimate BOD would be very similar since there would be very little organic material left after 5 days. However a final effluent of a sewage treatment works serving a large industrialised area might have a discharge where the ultimate BOD was much greater than the 5 day BOD because much of the easily degraded material would have been removed in the sewage treatment process and many industrial processes discharge difficult to degrade organic molecules. The laboratory test procedures for the determining the above oxygen demands are detailed in many standard texts. American versions include the \\"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater.\\"Clescerl, Leonore S.(Editor), Greenberg, Arnold E.(Editor), Eaton, Andrew D. (Editor). Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (20th ed.) American Public Health Association, Washington, DC. . This publication is also available on CD-ROM and online by subscription. Nitrogen Nitrogen is an important nutrient for plant and animal growth. Atmospheric nitrogen is less biologically available than dissolved nitrogen in the form of ammonia and nitrates. Availability of dissolved nitrogen may contribute to algal blooms. Ammonia and organic forms of nitrogen are often measured as Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, and analysis for inorganic forms of nitrogen may be performed for more accurate estimates of total nitrogen content. Phosphates ;Total Phosphorus and Phosphate, PO Phosphates enter the water ways through both non-point sources and point sources. Non-point source (NPS) pollution refers to water pollution from diffuse sources. Nonpoint source pollution can be contrasted with point source pollution, where discharges occur to a body of water at a single location. The non-point sources of phosphates include: natural decomposition of rocks and minerals, storm water runoff, agricultural runoff, erosion and sedimentation, atmospheric deposition, and direct input by animals/wildlife; whereas: point sources may include: waste water treatment plants and permitted industrial discharges. In general, the non-point source pollution typically is significantly higher than the point sources of pollution. Therefore, the key to sound management is to limit the input from both point and non-point sources of phosphate. High concentration of phosphate in water bodies is an indication of pollution and largely responsible for eutrophication.MacCutheon et al., 1983 Phosphates are not toxic to people or animals unless they are present in very high levels. Digestive problems could occur from extremely high levels of phosphate. The following criteria for total phosphorus were recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. # No more than 0.1 mg/L for streams which do not empty into reservoirs, # No more than 0.05 mg/L for streams discharging into reservoirs, and # No more than 0.025 mg/L for reservoirs.US EPA (1984) Phosphorus is normally low (< 1 mg/l) in clean potable water sources and usually not regulated;Nduka et al., 2008World Health Organization (1984) Chlorine Chlorine has been widely used for bleaching, as a disinfectant, and for biofouling prevention in water cooling systems. Remaining concentrations of oxidizing hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions may be measured as chlorine residual to estimate effectiveness of disinfection or to demonstrate safety for discharge to aquatic ecosystems. Biological characteristics Water may be tested by a bioassay comparing survival of an aquatic test species in the wastewater in comparison to water from some other source. Water may also be evaluated to determine the approximate biological population of the wastewater. Pathogenic micro-organisms using water as a means of moving from one host to another may be present in sewage. Coliform index measures the population of an organism commonly found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals as an indicator of the possible presence of other intestinal pathogens. Aquatic toxicology tests are used to provide qualitative and quantitative data on adverse effects on aquatic organisms from a toxicant. Testing types include acute (short-term exposure), chronic (life span) and bioaccumulation tests. Many industrial facilities in the US conduct \\"whole effluent toxicity\\" (WET) tests on their wastewater discharges, typically in combination with chemical tests for selected pollutants.

Each ink cartridge contains one or more ink reservoirs; certain producers also add electronic contacts and a chip that communicates with the printer.  Design = Thermal  Most consumer inkjet printers, such as those made by Canon, HP, and Lexmark (but not Epson) use a thermal inkjet; inside each partition of the ink reservoir is a heating element with a tiny metal plate or resistor. In response to a signal given by the printer, a tiny current flows through the metal or resistor making it warm, and the ink in contact with the heated resistor is vaporized into a tiny steam bubble inside the nozzle. As a consequence, an ink droplet is forced out of the cartridge nozzle onto the paper. This process takes a fraction of a millisecond. The printing depends on the smooth flow of ink, which can be hindered if the ink begins to dry at the print head, as can happen when an ink level becomes low. Dried ink can be cleaned from a cartridge print head using 91% denatured isopropyl alcohol (not rubbing alcohol). Isopropyl alcohol does not damage the susceptible sponge that is vital in transferring ink to paper. But it is strong enough to dissolve clogs. It must be administered carefully with a dropper or a syringe. Tap water contains contaminants that may clog the print head, so distilled water and a lint-free cloth is recommended. The ink also acts as a coolant to protect the metal-plate heating elements ‚àí when the ink supply is depleted, and printing is attempted, the heating elements in thermal cartridges often burn out, permanently damaging the print head. When the ink first begins to run low, the cartridge should be refilled or replaced, to avoid overheating damage to the print head.  Piezoelectric  All Epson printers use a piezoelectric crystal in each nozzle instead of a heating element. When current is applied, the crystal changes shape or size, increasing the pressure in the ink channel and thus forcing a droplet of ink from the nozzle. There are two types of crystals used: those that elongate when subjected to electricity or bi-morphs which bend. The ink channels in a piezoelectric ink jet print head can be formed using a variety of techniques, but one common method is lamination of a stack of metal plates, each of which includes precision micro-fabricated features of various shapes (i.e. containing an ink channel, orifice, reservoir and crystal). This cool environment allows use of inks which react badly when heated. For example, roughly 1/1000 of every ink jet is vaporised due to the intense heat, and ink must be designed not the clog the printer with the products of thermal decomposition. It also can make a smaller ink drop in some situations than thermal inkjet schemes.  Parts  Cartridge body = Stores the ink of the ink cartridge. Others contain hydrophobic foam that prevents refilling. = Printhead = Some ink cartridges have printheads installed on them. Printheads of ink cartridges consists of four parts: * Nozzle plate: the part where ink goes through from ink cartridge to paper. * Cover plate: covers the nozzles when they are not in use. * Common ink chamber: where ink is transferred from the body before printing. * (In piezoelectric printers) piezoelectric substrate: houses the piezoelectric crystal. * (In thermal printers) metallic plate / resistor: is heated with a weak electrical current which heats the ink.  Variants  * Color inkjets use the CMYK color model: cyan, magenta, yellow, and the key, black. Over the years, two distinct forms of black have become available: one that blends readily with other colors for graphical printing, and a near-waterproof variant for text. * Most modern inkjets carry a black cartridge for text, and either a single CMYK combined or a discrete cartridge for each color; while keeping colors separate was initially rare, it has become common in more recent years. Some higher-end inkjets offer cartridges for extra colors. * Some cartridges contain ink specially formulated for printing photographs. * All printer suppliers produce their own type of ink cartridges. Cartridges for different printers may be incompatible ‚Äî either physically or electrically. * Some manufacturers incorporate the printer's head into the cartridge (examples include HP, Dell, and Lexmark), while others such as Epson keep the print head a part of the printer itself. Both sides make claims regarding their approach leading to lower costs for the consumer. * More recently Epson has introduced a range of printers that use refillable ink tanks, providing a major reduction in printing cost. This operates similar to continuous ink system printers such as provided by Canon. Epson does not subsidise the cost of these printers termed its \\"Ecotank\\" range.  Consumer exploitation lawsuits  It can sometimes be cheaper to buy a new printer than to replace the set of ink cartridges supplied with the printer. The major printer manufacturers ‚àí Hewlett Packard, Lexmark, Dell, Canon, Epson and Brother ‚àí use a \\"razor and blades\\" business model, often breaking even or losing money selling printers while expecting to make a profit by selling cartridges over the life of the printer. Since much of the printer manufacturers' profits are from ink and toner cartridge sales, some of these companies have taken various actions against aftermarket cartridges. Some printer manufacturers set up their cartridges to interact with the printer, preventing operation when the ink level is low, or when the cartridge has been refilled. One researcher with the magazine Which? over-rode such an interlocked system and found that in one case he could print up to 38% more good quality pages, after the chip stated that the cartridge was empty. In the United Kingdom, in 2003, the cost of ink has been the subject of an Office of Fair Trading investigation, as Which? magazine has accused manufacturers of a lack of transparency about the price of ink and called for an industry standard for measuring ink cartridge performance. Which? stated that color HP cartridges cost over seven times more per milliliter than 1985 Dom Perignon. In 2006, Epson lost from a class action lawsuit that claimed Epson inkjet printers and ink cartridges stop printer operation due to \\"empty\\" cartridge notifications even when usable ink still remains. Epson settled the case by giving $45 e-coupons in their online stores for people who bought Epson inkjet printers and ink cartridges from April 8, 1999 to May 8, 2006. In 2010, HP lost from three class action lawsuits: 1.) claims of HP inkjet printers giving false low ink notifications, 2.) claims of cyan ink being spent when printing with black ink, 3.) claims of ink cartridges being disabled by printers upon being detected as \\"empty\\" even if they are not yet empty. HP paid $5 million in settlement. In 2017, Halte √† L‚ÄôObsolescence Programm√™e (HOP) ‚Äî End Planned Obsolescence ‚Äî filed a lawsuit and won against Brother, Canon, Epson, HP and other companies for intentionally shortening product lifespans - inkjet printers and ink cartridges included. The companies were fined ‚Ç¨15,000. In September 2018, HP lost a class action lawsuit where plaintiffs claim HP printer firmware updates caused fake error messages upon using third party ink cartridges. HP settled the case with $1.5 million. In October 2019, Epson was filed a class action complaint for printer firmware updates that prevent printer operation upon detection of third party cartridges.  Pricing  Ink cartridges are typically priced at of ink, meaning that refill cartridges sometimes cost a substantial fraction of the cost of the printer. To save money, many people use compatible ink cartridges from a vendor other than the printer manufacturer. Others use aftermarket inks, refilling their own ink cartridges using a kit that includes bulk ink. The high cost of cartridges has also provided an incentive for counterfeiters to supply cartridges falsely claiming to be made by the original manufacturer. The print cartridge industry lost an estimated $3 billion in 2009 due to this, according to an International Data Corporation estimate. Another alternative involves modifications of an original cartridge allowing use of continuous ink systems with external ink tanks. Some manufacturers, including Canon and Epson, have introduced new models featuring in-built continuous ink systems. This was seen as a welcome move by users, especially small business owners who rely on bulk-printing solutions, like Internet cafes and small-scale print shops.  Refills and third party replacements  Infusing an inkjet printer Because printer cartridges from the original manufacturer are often expensive, demand exists for cheaper third party options. These include:  Ink refill services  Ink refill services are available in office supplies stores, pharmacies and warehouse clubs such as Office Max, Walgreens and Costco. People simply give them their empty ink cartridges in order for them to be refilled.  Ink Sold in Bulk  People buy large bottles of ink, ranging from 100m to 5 gallons. Ink from these bottles are transferred through syringes or droppers.  Cartridge refill kits  Cartridge refill kits can contain both ink syringes/droppers, rubber plugs, drill tool, screw driver and sealing tape. These are tools that you will need depending on your cartridge model. Some cartridges needed to be unscrewed or drilled or simply injected, depending on the design.  Re-manufactured cartridges  Remanufactured toner and ink cartridges makes up 30% of total printer cartridge market. Remanufactured cartridges are recycled cartridges that have been disassembled, cleaned and tested for quality. Worn or damaged parts are replaced and the cartridge is then re-assembled and refilled with ink. Manufacturing costs stay low since remanufactured cartridges do not require many new parts.  Compatible ink cartridges  Compatible ink cartridges are generic cartridges that are made of 100% new materials instead of remanufactured cartridges.  Continuous ink supply system  Perhaps the easiest, most trouble-free method of refilling ink cartridges is through the use of a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System). A CISS consists of a set of cartridges that have tubes connected to them, through which the ink continuously flows from ink reservoirs on the outside of the printer. Instead of refilling the cartridges themselves, the user simply refills the bottles on the outside of the printer. Early CIS systems were composed of OEM cartridges that had been drilled and outfitted with fittings to accept the ink delivery tubes, a set of 'ribbon' tubes, and plastic bottles with holes drilled in the caps for the tubes and the vents. Today's CIS systems are mass-produced in China, often incorporating all ink bottles into one partitioned container. They typically utilize auto- reset chips, which means the cartridges rarely have to be removed from the printer. Resetting an Epson ink cartridge using a resetter tool  Legality of refills and third party replacements  The legality of this industry was brought to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components. The Court ruled that reverse-engineering the handshaking procedure to enable compatibility did not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The Supreme Court of the United States also ruled in May 2017 in Impression Products v. Lexmark that companies cannot use patent law to block reuse of products protected by patent once the product is sold, which in the case of ink cartridges, allows the sale of refurbished cartridges both within the United States and overseas. HP has fiercely defended its printing interests from the refill industry, including filing patent complaints and false advertising lawsuits which allege that inferior ink is not properly differentiated from the original HP ink.  Quality of refills and third party replacements  Back in 2007, PC World reports that refilled cartridges have higher failure rates, print fewer pages than new cartridges, and demonstrate more on-page problems like streaking, curling, and color bleed. Therefore product or service research is often recommended. In the tests made by Wilhelm Imaging Research, Epson ink is fade- resistant up to 40 years. Ink from remanufactured cartridges are only fade- resistant up to 3.9 years.  Environmental impact  Facts = The list below outlines a few facts about toner/ink cartridges and the impact they have on the environment. * Each year over 350 million cartridges are thrown out to landfills. * By the year 2012, 500 million laser cartridges and 1.8 billion ink cartridges had been dumped in landfills. * Cartridges can take up to 425 to 1,000 years to decompose. * Every ink cartridge becomes of solid waste. = New laws = Many programs have been implemented in the United States and Europe to encourage the recycling of ink cartridges. New York has implemented a recycling law for businesses and consumers regarding toner and ink cartridges. In California the Public Contract Code (PCC) section 12156 encourages businesses to purchase recycled ink and toner cartridges. In the UK, large compatible cartridge manufacturers have implemented recycling programs in order to receive back empty cartridges for refilling of HP, Lexmark, Dell, etc. cartridges, as no compatible version is readily available.  Faults  Occasionally an error occurs in a factory which can lead to an ink cartridge developing a fault. While such a case is rare, the cartridge will be irreparable and the customer should seek a refund from the manufacturer. This is not to be confused with a clogged printhead.

Robert of Arbrissel ( 1045 ‚Äì 1116) was an itinerant preacher, and founder of Fontevraud Abbey. He was born at Arbrissel (near Retiers, Brittany) and died at Orsan. Sources The first Vita was written by Baudri of Dol, bishop of Dol-en-Bretagne (formerly abbot of the monastery of Saint-Pierre of Bourgueil), shortly after Robert's death in 1116. A second Life was commissioned a few years later by Petronilla, Abbess of Fontevrault, probably to support her authority as abbess. Biography Robert was born around 1045 at Arbrissel in Brittany, the son of Domalioch and Orguende. His father was a parish priest. Married clergy were not uncommon prior to the Gregorian reform. He probably succeeded his father as priest to the parish. Seeking to improve his education, he went to Paris where he spent some years in study,Dalarun, Jacques. Robert of Arbrissel: Sex, Sin, and Salvation in the Middle Ages, CUA Press, 2006 perhaps under Anselm of Laon and later displayed considerable theological knowledge. The date and place of his ordination are unknown.Webster, Douglas Raymund. \\"Robert of Arbrissel.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 31 Jan. 2015 Sometime prior to 1076, Robert returned to his parish. In 1078, Bishop Sylvester de La Guerche, was deposed by a legate of Gregory VII, and as Robert had supported Sylvester's election, Robert was compelled to leave the diocese. Robert resumed his studies in Paris until recalled by the now reinstated Bishop Sylvester. He then served as Sylvester's archpriest, effectively running the diocese of Rennes. Bishop Sylvester attempted, with Robert's assistance, to introduce reforms, which provoked antagonism on the part of the Breton clergy. Upon the death of Sylvester around 1093, Robert fled to Angers and there commenced ascetic practices which he continued throughout his life. In 1095 he became a hermit in the forest of Craon (south-west of Laval), living a life of severe penance in the company of Bernard of Thiron, afterwards founder of the Congregation of Tiron, Vitalis, founder of Savigny Abbey, and others of considerable note. His piety, eloquence, and asceticism attracted many followers, for whom in 1096 he founded the monastery of La Ro√© of Canons Regular, becoming himself the first abbot. In the same year Urban II summoned him to Angers and appointed him an apostolic missionary authorized to preach anywhere. His eloquence, heightened by his strikingly ascetic appearance, drew crowds everywhere. Those who desired to embrace the monastic state under his leadership he sent to La Ro√©, but the Canons objected to the number and diversity of the postulants. Robert resigned the abbacy, and in 1099 founded the double monastery of Fontevrault. He appointed Hersende of Champagne, kinswoman to the Duke of Brittany as abbess, and Petronilla, baroness of Chemille, as coadjutress. Fontrevault followed the Rule of St. Benedict.Butler, Alban. \\"B. Robert of Arbrissel\\", The Lives of the Saints, Vol II, 1866 Robert's legend has long alluded to the presence of converted prostitutes and there is indeed considerable contemporary evidence for this assertion. Baldric of Dol writes of the presence amongst Robert's disciples of meretrices ‚Äì a Latin word usually used at the time to refer to prostitutes, or at the very least, morally loose women. The almost-certainty of prostitutes being amongst Robert's followers is confirmed by a text discovered at the monastery of Vaux-de-Cernay. In the text, Robert visits a brothel in Rouen and speaks of sin to the prostitutes there; enraptured, they walk away into the wilderness with him. Robert aimed to ‚Äúattract adulterers and prostitutes to the medicine of repentance‚Äù, the text avers. The story it relates may not be entirely true in the matters of its facts, but it relates the essential truth that Robert had prostitute followers ‚Äì by virtue of showing that such a story was in common currency at the time. Robert also dedicated one of the houses at his abbey of Fontevrault to Mary Magdalene. Robert continued his missionary journeys over the whole of Western France till the end of his life, but little is known of this period. He was, however, accused by Abbot Geoffrey of Vend√¥me and Bishop Marbod of Rennes for sleeping with some of his female followers. It is more likely that Robert was mimicking the practice of syneisaktism, an early church practice in which male and female religious would live together in a form of chaste marriage.Elliott, Dyan. Spiritual Marriage: Sexual Abstinence in Medieval Wedlock At the Council of Poitiers, November 1100, he supported the papal legates in excommunicating Philip I of France on account of his lawless union with Bertrade de Montfort; in 1110 he attended the Council of Nantes. Knowledge of his approaching death caused him to take steps to ensure the permanence of his foundation at Fontevrault. He imposed a vow of stability on his monks and summoned a Chapter (September, 1116) to settle the form of government. From Hautebruy√®re a priory founded by the penitent Bertrade, he went to Orsan, another priory of Fontevrault, where he died. The \\"Vita Andre√¶\\" gives a detailed account of his last year of life. Veneration Robert was never canonized, but was beatified: thus is Blessed Robert's feast day in the Western Church February 24. The accusation made against him by Geoffrey of Vend√¥me of extreme indiscretion in his choice of exceptional ascetic practices (see P.L., CLVII, 182) was the source of much controversy during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Other evidence of eccentric actions on Robert's part and scandals among his mixed followers may have helped to give rise to these rumors. The Fontevrists did everything in their power to discredit the attacks on their founder. The accusatory letters of bishop Marbodius of Rennes and Geoffrey of Vend√¥me were without sufficient cause declared to be forgeries and the MS. Letter of Peter of Saumur was made away with, probably at the instigation of Jeanne Baptiste de Bourbon, Abbess of Fontevrault. This natural daughter of Henry IV of France applied to Pope Innocent X for the beatification of Robert, her request being supported by Louis XIV and Henrietta of England. Both this attempt and one made about the middle of the nineteenth century failed, but Robert is usually given the title of \\"Blessed\\". The original recension of the Rule of Fontevrault no longer exists; the only surviving writing of Robert is his letter of exhortation to Ermengarde of Brittany.ed.

Collegiate education and The Offspring Lilja attended the University of California, Los Angeles between 1984 and 1988, and from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology. In 1984, Lilja had joined the group Manic Subsidal, which eventually changed its name to The Offspring in 1986. Lilja played on the group's first demo tape in 1986, which earned them early exposure through a positive review in Maximumrocknroll magazine. Later that year, Lilja performed on the band's debut single, \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" released through Black Label Records. Lilja also helped write the song \\"Beheaded,\\" later featured on the group's debut album, The Offspring (1989). Lilja amicably departed from The Offspring; The Offspring frontman Dexter Holland has said that Lilja was so focused on getting into medical school that the band let him go on friendly terms. Lilja‚Äôs position in the Offspring was filled by Ron Welty in 1987, who was only 16 years old at the time.

History Peso was the name of the 8 real coins circulating in Ecuador since the Spanish colonial period. In 1856, the currency was pegged to the French franc, with 1 peso = 5 francs. From 1862, paper money was issued denominated in reales and pesos. The peso was formally adopted as the currency of Ecuador in 1871, replacing the real at a rate of 1 peso = 8 reales. It was subdivided into 100 centavos. In 1884, the peso was replaced by the sucre at par. Coins The only coins issued between 1871 and 1884 were 1 and 2 centavos, struck in cupro-nickel at the Heaton mint in Birmingham. These coins continued to circulate after the sucre was adopted.

Placed under the administration of the French national radio (named Radio France since 1975), the ONF performs mainly in the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es from where all its concerts are broadcast. Some concerts are also held in the Salle Olivier Messiaen in the Maison de Radio France (formerly known as Maison de la Radio).  History  The orchestra has had several names over its history: * 1934‚Äì1945: Orchestre national (National Orchestra) * 1945‚Äì1949: Orchestre national de la Radiodiffusion fran√ßaise (French Radio National Orchestra) * 1949‚Äì1964: Orchestre national de la Radio-t√©l√©vision fran√ßaise or Orchestre national de la RTF (French Radio and Television National Orchestra) * 1964‚Äì1974: Orchestre national de l'Office de radiodiffusion-t√©l√©vision fran√ßaise or Orchestre national de l'ORTF (National Orchestra of the French Radio and Television Office) * 1975‚Äìpresent: Orchestre national de France The orchestra was founded as the Orchestre national by decree on 18 February 1934, by the French minister of Posts Jean Mistler, as an ensemble of 80 musicians, with D√©sir√©-Emile Inghelbrecht as musical director.Alain Paris, ¬´Orchestre National de France¬ª, Encyclop√¶dia Universalis (online) The orchestra musicians were under exclusive engagements, prohibiting them to play with other orchestras as the orchestra of the Opera. Their first concert occurred at the Conservatoire de Paris on 13 March 1934. The main conductors in the orchestra's early years were Inghelbrecht, Roger D√©sormi√®re and Eug√®ne Bigot, as well as Inghelrecht's assistant conductor at the time, Manuel Rosenthal. In 1939, half of the musicians were mobilized in the French army. The other half of the orchestra settled in Rennes between 26 October 1939 and 16 June 1940, when bombings on the city forced the orchestra to be disbanded. The Vichy government then recreated the orchestra in March 1941. The orchestra was based in Marseilles, without Jewish musicians, who were excluded (among them Clara Haskil's sister, the violinist Jeanne Haskil). The orchestra returned to Paris on 1 March 1943. Since 1944, the orchestra has been based in the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, where it occasionally plays in the pit for opera productions. After the Liberation of France, after examination of his role under the occupation, Inghelbrecht was replaced by Manuel Rosenthal as principal conductor. The orchestra is reorganized and placed under the responsibility of the national radio, the Radiodiffusion Nationale, which became Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise on 23 March 1945. Further modifications to the French national radio organisation name were Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise (RTF) on 9 February 1949, then Office de radiodiffusion-t√©l√©vision fran√ßaise on 27 June 1964, and finally Radio France on 1 January 1975. The name of the orchestra was progressively modified in accordance with these changes in organization. Rosenthal reinstated contemporary and French music banned under the German occupation on orchestra programmes. The orchestra also starts to serve as a cultural ambassador for France, with tours in Berlin and London in 1946 and in North America in 1948, the last with Charles Munch as conductor. The first official recordings of the orchestra, with conductor Paul Kletzki, appeared in 1947 (Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky, in the arrangement by Ravel, and the Bol√©ro by the latter). In contemporary music, the orchestra premiered Pierre Boulez' Le Soleil des eaux in 1950 (with the French premiere of B√©la Bart√≥k Divertimento in the same concert), and a few days later the first European performance of Messiaen's Turangal√Æla- Symphonie, in Aix-en-Provence. The orchestra premiered Henri Dutilleux's Symphony No 1 in 1951. Other major pieces were played for the first time in France by the Orchestre national, and among them Wozzeck by Alban Berg (under Jascha Horenstein), and several of Anton Bruckner's and Gustav Mahler's symphonies. In 1952, then-principal conductor Roger D√©sormi√®re suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed, and was forced to retire. The orchestra did not have a principal conductor for the next 8 years, but regular guest conductors included Andr√© Cluytens.Erik Baeck, Andr√© Cluytens, itin√©raire d'un chef d'orchestre (Brussels, Mardaga, 2009, pp. 148‚Äì50 Cluytens was noted for his performances of the German repertoire with the orchestra, and led it during tours in the USSR (1959), at the Salzburg Festival (1959) and in the Middle East (1960). Other work in contemporary music included the 2 December 1954 premiere of D√©serts by Edgar Var√®se, under the direction of Hermann Scherchen. During the 1950s, the orchestra also recorded numerous compositions by Heitor Villa-Lobos under his direction, for EMI. Maurice Le Roux became music director in 1960, the first conductor to hold that title with the orchestra. The Maison de la Radio was opened during this time, but the orchestra continued to perform in the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es. In the context of competition with the newly founded Orchestre de Paris in 1967, Jean Martinon became music director of the Orchestre national in 1968. His commercial recordings with the orchestra included the complete orchestral works by Claude Debussy, and the symphonies by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. In 1973, Sergiu Celibidache was recruited as premier chef invit√© (principal guest conductor), but he ended his contract in 1975, as a result of a conflict with some of the musicians. In January 1975, the creation of Radio France led to the renaming of the ensemble as the Orchestre National de France, the title the ensemble holds today. An additional new permanent orchestra, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, was also created in 1976, by merging several smaller ensembles. This allowed the Orchestre National de France to concentrate on obtaining international prestige, without a music director, but with noted guest conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Wolfgang Sawallisch and Seiji Ozawa. In 1977, Lorin Maazel became principal guest conductor (premier chef invit√©), and he officially became music director in 1988, holding the title until 1991. Charles Dutoit became the ONF's music director in 1991. Kurt Masur succeeded Dutoit as ONF music director, from 2002 to 2008. Masur conducted the ONF's debut appearance at The Proms in August 2006. Daniele Gatti was music director from 2008 to 2016. In June 2016, Radio France announced the appointment of Emmanuel Krivine as the ONF's next music director, effective with the 2017‚Äì2018 season, with an initial contract of 3 years. He held the title of music director-designate (directeur musical d√©sign√©) for the 2016‚Äì2017 season. Krivine had been scheduled to stand down as ONF music director at the close of the 2020-2021 season. However, in May 2020, Krivine resigned from his ONF post with immediate effect, one year ahead of his originally scheduled departure. In September 2018, Cristian MƒÉcelaru first guest-conducted the ONF, and returned for a second guest-conducting appearance in the summer of 2019. On the basis of these appearances, in November 2019, the ONF announced the appointment of MƒÉcelaru as its next music director, effective 1 September 2021, with an initial contract of 4 years. Following the early resignation of Krivine, MƒÉcelaru became music director of the ONF on 1 September 2020, one year earlier than originally scheduled. In addition to commercial recordings for EMI Records during the years 1960‚Äì1980, in the French repertoire, other recordings from the orchestra have been issued by Radio France itself, associated with Na√Øve Records.

The group participates in the G.I. Rights Hotline, and works against all forms of conscription. There are no charges for any of CCW's services. The group was organized as National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors on October 5, 1940 by the three historic peace churches in response to the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, which introduced the first peacetime draft in the United States. The Selective Service Act provided for work of national importance and an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors. The immediate task of this group was to advise conscientious objectors and create a structure for the proposed alternative service. On November 26, 1940, National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was merged with a similar organization, Civilian Service Board to become National Service Board for Religious Objectors (NSBRO). In the following months additional groups became interested in the work of NSBRO and positions on the governing board was expanded to include representatives from the Fellowship of Reconciliation, Fellowship of Peace of the Methodist Church, Disciples of Christ and Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. During this first year a total of fifteen groups became members of NSBRO and by the end of the war this number grew to thirty nine. NSBRO was responsible for 150 Civilian Public Service camps during World War II. During its first year, 3000 conscientious objectors were referred to NSBRO by Selective Service. In all, nearly 12,000 World War II COs would be handled by NSBRO. The program for conscientious objectors, Civilian Public Service (CPS), was under civilian control with NSBRO responsible for working with the government and representing the interests of the churches and other groups involved. The work of NSBRO was divided into three sections. The Camp Section selected sites, often former Civilian Conservation Corps facilities, for use as CPS base camps, The Assignment Section matched men with camps and units, keeping detailed records of the assignments and projects. The Complaint Section worked with cases of men who were denied conscientious objector status. Later an Advisory Section was created to track the changes in Selective Service regulations and interpret them to NSBRO constituency. Regular contact was made with COs who chose prison over CPS. Conscientious objectors were required to serve into 1947, past the end of the war. Member groups who disagreed with this policy or the cooperation required with a system of conscription began to withdraw from the organization. War Resisters League pulled out early in the war, followed by Fellowship of Reconciliation, American Friends Service Committee, and Association of Catholic Conscientious Objectors. The last CPS camp closed in April 1947, completing this phase of NSBRO work. In 1964 the name was changed to National Interreligious Service Board for Conscientious Objectors (NISBCO) and in 2000 became Center on Conscience & War (CCW). Today, the work of the Center on Conscience & War is mainly with members of the US military who experience a crisis of conscience and seek discharge as conscientious objectors. CCW also provides technical and community support to other conscientious objectors, including immigrants seeking citizenship in the US who are moved by conscience to take an alternative oath of citizenship that does not include a promise to bear arms, and youth facing Selective Service (draft) registration.

The company provides radar systems to navies, governments, coastlines, ports and VTS installations as well as radars for land based security and surveillance applications. Part of Kelvin Hughes' history includes producing the first Type Approved commercial radar in 1947 as well as the first paper chart tracing service in 1971. Modern day products that Kelvin Hughes sell include SharpEye‚Ñ¢, a solid state radar with clutter management and Doppler processing. History=The Kelvin connection Kelvin Hughes Type 14/9 Radar from front Kelvin Hughes Type 14/9 Radar from side The Kelvin connection is based upon the professional relationship between William Thomson (later-Lord Kelvin) (1824‚Äì1907), Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University from 1846‚Äì1899 and James White (1824‚Äì1884), a Glasgow-based Optical Instrument Maker. White's association with Thomson lasted until he died, but without any legal deeds of co-partnership White bore the financial risks of their working partnership. James White founded the firm of James White, Optician and Philosophical Instrument Makers in Glasgow in 1850 and was involved in the supply and maintenance of apparatus for Thomson's university laboratory and worked with him on experimental constructions. By 1854, White was producing electrical instruments such as electrometers and electrical balances from Thomson's designs. William Thomson was appointed a director of the Atlantic Telegraph Company in 1856 and in 1858 was 'electrician' on HMS Agamemnon that laid the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Unfortunately this cable failed soon after it was laid. In 1857, White entered into a short-lived partnership, White & Barr, with John Barr. The partnership lasted until 1860 when it was dissolved and White reverted to his previous company name of James White. White was declared bankrupt in August 1861, and then discharged four months later. In 1866 the Great Eastern laid the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable and Thomson was knighted. During this time White was involved in the production of machinery that Thomson had designed to address problems encountered in laying cables at sea, helping to make possible the first transatlantic cable connection. At the same time, he continued to make a whole range of more conventional instruments such as microscopes, telescopes and surveying equipment. During 1870 White was largely responsible for equipping Sir William's laboratory in the new University premises at Gilmorehill in his capacity as Philosophical Instrument Maker to the University of Glasgow. In 1874 Sir William investigated the Mariner's compass for a magazine article. This initiated his extensive work on compasses and marine instruments. From 1876 White was producing accurate compasses for metal ships to Sir William's design, and this became an important part of his business in the latter years of his life. After White's death in 1884, Sir William continued to maintain his interest in the White business and raised most of the capital needed to construct and equip new workshops in Cambridge Street, Glasgow. At the Cambridge Street premises, the company continued to make the compass Sir William had designed during the 1870s and to supply it in some quantity, especially to the Admiralty. The Admiralty adopted the patent compass as a standard for Royal Navy use in 1889. At the same time, the firm became increasingly involved in the design, production and sale of electrical apparatus. White's business continued under the same name, being administered by Matthew Edwards and David Reid. This continued until 1891 when Matthew Edward left to set up his own company. In 1890 the company sued Alexander Hughes for infringement of compass patents. Sir William was raised to the Peerage as Baron Kelvin of Largs in 1892. In 1899, Lord Kelvin resigned from his University chair and, in 1900 became a director in the newly formed private limited liability company, Kelvin & James White Ltd, which acquired the business of James White. At the same time, Lord Kelvin's nephew, James Thomson Bottomley FRSE (1845‚Äì1926), joined the firm. The firm manufactured binnacle compasses and deep sea sounding machines, many of which were installed on the great ships built on Clyde side. Around 1904, a London branch office was opened, which by 1915 had taken the name Kelvin, White & Hutton Ltd. From 1918 Wilfred O. White sold Kelvin and White compasses in the USA under the name of Kelvin and Wilfred O. White Co., Boston and New York. Wilfred O. White also sold his own patented compasses under the same name. In 1913 Dr Bottomley became chairman of Kelvin & James White Ltd and the firm changed its name, becoming Kelvin Bottomley & Baird Ltd. Alfred Baird had been a compass adjuster with the firm since 1884. Kelvin, Bottomley and Baird Ltd manufactured Marine navigation equipment such as \\"Kelvite\\" binnacle compasses and sounding machines at the Kelvin Works, Hillington, Glasgow. In 1934 Kelvin Bottomley & Baird Ltd built an instrument factory at Basingstoke which was later to become the Smiths Industries Aerospace site. Following the destruction of the London offices in the Blitz of 1941, discussions were initiated with Henry Hughes & Sons Ltd regarding collaboration which resulted in the establishing of the joint venture company Marine Instruments Ltd at 107, Fenchurch Street, London in 1942. The Hughes connection The Hughes family were originally clockmakers in the east end of London who progressed into supplying sextants and marine chronometers to ships coming into the River Thames. In 1712 Thomas Hughes became a member of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers at the age of 26 and was elected as Master of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in 1742. His son, Thomas Hughes (junior) had his business at 25 New Bond Street London and was elected as Master of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in 1762. In 1781 William Hughes, believed to be the son of Thomas Hughes Junior, was elected freeman of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers and sold a cabin clock to Captain Cook. Joseph Hughes, believed to be the son of William born in 1781, lived and worked at 16 Queen Street, Ratcliffe. He was to become a well-known maker of quadrants and compasses. His son Henry Hughes was born in 1816. In 1838 Henry Hughes & Sons was founded at 120 (later at 59), Fenchurch Street, London as a maker of chronographs and scientific instruments. Henry died in 1879 and his son Alexander succeeded him as chairman. The firm was incorporated as Henry Hughes & Sons Ltd in 1903 and opened a production facility in Forest Gate. Alexander's son Arthur was works manager and his elder brother Henry Alexander Hughes was director and secretary. In 1915 the site at Hainault was purchased and in 1917 the first part of the factory was opened. This site is the current headquarters of the modern Kelvin Hughes Ltd. In 1923, the company produced the first practical recording echo sounder. In 1935, S Smith & Son Ltd acquired a controlling interest in the company. This resulted in the development of new marine and aircraft instruments and a major expansion of the Hainault factory. Following the destruction of the Fenchurch street offices in the Blitz of 1941, discussions with Kelvin, Bottomley & Baird Ltd resulted in the establishing of the joint venture company Marine Instruments Ltd at 107, Fenchurch Street, London in 1942. Kelvin Hughes Kelvin Hughes Ltd was formed in 1947 by the merger between the scientific instrument manufacturing firms of Henry Hughes & Son Ltd, London, England, and Kelvin Bottomley & Baird Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland with Marine Instruments Ltd acting as regional agents in the UK. Kelvin & Hughes Ltd were essentially a part of Smith's Industries Ltd founded in 1944 as the successors of S Smith & Son Ltd. Kelvin & Hughes Ltd was liquidated in 1966 but the name was continued as Kelvin Hughes, a division of Smiths Group plc. In 1990 Kelvin Hughes acquired Lokata Ltd assimilating their range of NAVTEX, EPIRB and SART products. During 1994 the Chart and Maritime division was enhanced with the acquisition of Brown and Perring (London) and Observator (Rotterdam) Kelvin Hughes acquired QUBIT in August 1994 adding their range of integrated navigation, data acquisition and processing systems to the product range. In November 2007 Kelvin Hughes was bought out from Smiths Group plc and operated independently as Kelvin Hughes Ltd under part ownership by ECI Partners. Kelvin Hughes announced it was sold to Hensoldt by ECI Partners on 29 June 2017.

Plot Emory Leeson is an advertising executive who experiences a nervous breakdown. He designs a series of \\"truthful\\" advertisements, blunt and bawdy and of no use to his boss Drucker's firm. One of his colleagues, Stephen Bachman, checks him into a psychiatric hospital. Emory goes into group therapy under the care of Dr. Liz Baylor and meets other voluntary patients, such as the lovely and vulnerable Kathy Burgess. There is also George, who can speak only one word: \\"Hello.\\" By mistake, Emory's advertisements get printed and the new campaign turns out to be a tremendous success. Campaigns like: \\"Jaguar ‚Äî For men who'd like hand jobs from beautiful women they hardly know.\\" and \\"Volvo ‚Äî they're boxy but they're good.\\" Drucker grabs credit for the ads. He assigns Stephen and the rest of his employees to design similar new ad campaigns featuring so-called honesty in advertising, but nothing works. Emory is approached in the sanitarium about creating new ads himself. He insists that his fellow mental patients also be involved and suitably rewarded for their work, transforming the sanitarium into a branch of the advertising industry. They come up with wild advertising slogans, like one for a Greek travel agency that goes: \\"Forget Paris. The French can be annoying. Come to Greece. We're nicer.\\" And another one called \\"Come‚Ä¶ IN the Bahamas\\" for the islands' national tourism board. The patients experience happiness at being needed and improve from their various illnesses. The evil Drucker and the doctor in charge of the hospital get greedy and try to separate the team. But it doesn't work. Dr. Baylor defies her boss and Emory negotiates to get new automobiles for all of the patients. Emory and Kathy, who have fallen in love, leave the hospital in an army helicopter piloted by Kathy's long-lost brother, stopping to take the rest of the patients with them.

K. Rowling, published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. It is the second novel in the Cormoran Strike series of detective novels and was followed by Career of Evil in 2015 Lethal White in 2018 and Troubled Blood in 2020. Plot summary Several months after solving the Lula Landry case, Cormoran Strike is asked by Leonora Quine to locate her novelist husband Owen, a former literary genius whose attempts to recreate his past success have failed. Owen disappeared around the same time his latest book, Bombyx Mori, was leaked. The book has been deemed unpublishable due to its mixture of sexual assault, torture, and cannibalism as well as its slanderous depiction of the people in Owen's life. In addition to Leonora, Strike sets out interviewing the other people portrayed in the manuscript: Owen's lover Kathryn Kent, prot√©g√©e Pippa Midgley, agent Elizabeth Tassel, editor Jerry Waldegrave, publisher Daniel Chard and former friend Michael Fancourt. The suspects, however, soon turn on one another, accusing and counter-accusing each other of killing Owen and ghostwriting Bombyx Mori. As the investigation commences, Strike's relationship with Robin Ellacott gradually deteriorates, as she feels neglected by him and he feels unwilling to put her in a position where she is forced to choose between her job and her fianc√© Matthew. The animosity is tempered when Strike finds Owen's body, which has been mutilated, doused in acid and posed to resemble the ending of Bombyx Mori. Metropolitan Police later arrest Leonora for the murder, prompting Strike to set out clearing her name. Robin, meanwhile, strains her relationship with Matthew after she almost misses his mother's funeral to help Strike and gets caught telling a lie. She later confronts Strike about his intentions only to be warned that she will be asked to do things Matthew will not like if she becomes an investigator. With the case against Leonora piling up, Strike focuses on Fancourt, whose character in the manuscript is inconsistent with his relationship to Owen. Several years earlier, after Fancourt's wife wrote a novel that was panned by critics, an anonymous parody's release prompted her to kill herself. Fancourt accused Owen of authoring the parody and Tassel of enabling him. Strike soon deduces Bombyx Mori is a metaphor for someone else's life and Owen was intended to be the antagonist rather than the hero. Realizing the manuscript was penned by a ghostwriter, he creates a plan to confront the killer. He later approaches Fancourt at a party and asks to speak to him in private. When Tassel, who is also in attendance, joins them, Strike accuses Tassel of being Owen's killer and the ghostwriter. Tassel, a failed author herself, wrote the parody of Elspeth's novel, which Owen used to blackmail her for twenty years. When he approached her with the original concept for Bombyx Mori, Tassel concocted an elaborate plan. She conspired with Owen to stage his disappearance, rewrote Bombyx Mori, killed Owen and framed Leonora. Tassel attempts to flee, only to be caught and arrested, which Strike and Robin planned in advance. Sometime later, Leonora is released from prison, Fancourt acknowledges the original Bombyx Mori manuscript's literary value, and Strike tells Robin that he enrolled her in investigative training courses as a Christmas gift. Characters=Main characters * Cormoran Strike ‚Äì A veteran of the Afghanistan war who was discharged after losing half of his leg in a bomb attack and wanted to leave fearing insanity. He is a minor celebrity, thanks in part to his notorious rock star father and his solving of a high-profile murder. * Robin Ellacott ‚Äì Strike's assistant and secretary who harbors a secret fascination with the world of criminal investigations. Now taking on a full-time role within Strike's agency, she aspires to become an investigator in her own right. Bombyx Mori characters * Owen Quine ‚Äì an author once hailed as an avant-garde writer and one of the first \\"literary rebels\\". He has spent decades trying to recreate the success of his first novel, Hobart's Sin, to no avail. He is regarded as narcissistic and insecure in the extreme, and only tolerated because of the shadow of untapped potential in his works. ** Quine appears in the Bombyx Mori as Bombyx, an aspiring author whose genius is undisputed, unappreciated and unsubstantiated, prompting him to seek out his idols, but discovers that they only seek to use him and abuse him before eating him alive. * Leonora Quine ‚Äì Quine's wife, who becomes the prime suspect in his murder. She spends almost all of her time caring for their intellectually-disabled daughter, Orlando. ** Leonora appears as Succuba, a demon in the body of a hideous woman who holds Bombyx in bondage and repeatedly rapes him. * Kathryn Kent ‚Äì Quine's girlfriend and an author of \\"fantasy erotica\\" that has mostly been rejected by the London publishing community. ** Kathryn appears as Harpy, a beautiful woman with a hideous deformity, implied to be a crude and cruel metaphor for breast cancer. * Pippa Midgley ‚Äì a transgender woman undergoing therapy ahead of gender reassignment surgery. She becomes enamoured with Quine after taking a creative writing course he taught; Quine, in turn, was inspired by her personal story as it dovetailed with his original novel. ** Pippa appears as Epicoene, a slave to Harpy, who seeks to escape her clutches with Bombyx. Bombyx responds positively until she \\"sings\\", or reveals her transgender status to him, which he finds horrifying. * Elizabeth Tassel ‚Äì a failed writer who became a literary agent. She lives and works on the fringe of the London literary community, which she deeply resents, and expresses by bullying her staff. ** Tassel appears as The Tick, a parasitic woman who cultivates Bombyx's talent to leech off him. * Jerry Waldegrave ‚Äì Quine's long-suffering editor, who is one of the few people willing to tolerate him. His reputation is ruined by Quine's behaviour, leading to the breakdown of his marriage and his turn to alcoholism. ** Jerry appears as The Cutter, a horned, troll-like creature that ruthlessly destroys Bombyx's work. He carries a bloodied sack implied to carry an aborted foetus, and attempts to drown other creatures. * Michael Fancourt ‚Äì one of the original literary rebels, who went on to become a bestselling author. He maintains literature is an art form, and that art can only be considered as such when it provokes social discussion; however, this is little more than an excuse for his deeply misogynistic opinions. ** Michael appears as Vainglorious, a famous author and Bombyx's idol. He is revealed to be a charlatan, torturing his wife Effigy to fuel his own creativity and passing her torment off as art. * Daniel Chard ‚Äì the president of Roper Chard, a London publishing house specialising in modern literature. He lacks social skills and is implied to be a latent homosexual. ** Daniel appears as Phallus Impudicus, a man who murders writers to steal their talent, violating their corpses with his diseased penis. Other characters * Matthew Cunliffe ‚Äì Robin's fianc√©, who disapproves of her work with Strike. Despite considerable tension from this, Robin eventually tells him about her lifelong dream of being a detective and Matthew accepts to let her do it although he doesn't much like it. * Richard Anstis ‚Äì a detective with the Metropolitan Police who was involved in the incident that cost Strike his leg. Strike considers him a capable investigator, but lacking in imagination. * Orlando Quine ‚Äì Quine's intellectually-disabled daughter. She is the only person in Quine's life who does not appear in the Bombyx Mori manuscript, and it is implied that she is the only person he genuinely cares about. * Lucy ‚Äì Strike's half-sister on his mother's side, and the only member of his family that he has any regular contact with. Despite being his younger sister, she tends to mother him, encouraging him to settle down and start a family, much to Strike's consternation. * Alexander 'Al' Rokeby ‚Äì Strike's half-brother on his father's side, and the only member of his father's side of the family with whom he has any contact. * Nina Lascelles ‚Äì a junior editor at Roper Chard who helps Strike acquire the Bombyx Mori manuscript. She becomes enamoured with him and pursues a romantic relationship with him, which is not reciprocated. * Joe North ‚Äì an American writer and friend of Quine and Fancourt. He died of AIDS while writing about his experiences living with the disease. After lying abandoned for twenty years, the house where North died became the scene of Quine's murder. * Christian Fisher ‚Äì the editor of a niche publishing house who leaks the Bombyx Mori manuscript. * Dominic Culpepper ‚Äì an opportunistic tabloid journalist who hires Strike to find evidence of wrongdoing among the rich and powerful. He expresses surprise that Strike does not resort to phone- hacking to acquire evidence. * Charlotte Ross ‚Äì Strike's on-again, off-again former flame. Following the breakdown of their relationship, she has become engaged to another man, but continues to taunt Strike from afar. Reception Much like The Cuckoo's Calling, The Silkworm was met with critical acclaim, selling more copies than its predecessor in its opening weeks. Val McDermid from The Guardian gave the novel a positive review, but criticised the descriptions of the different London settings, which she considered superfluous: \\"I suspect that having spent so many books describing a world only she knew has left her with the habit of telling us rather too much about a world most of us know well enough to imagine for ourselves\\". The novel was also nominated for a Gold Dagger Award at the Crime Writers' Association Daggers 2015. In other media=Television On 10 December 2014, it was announced that the novels would be adapted as a television series for BBC One, starting with The Cuckoo's Calling. Rowling executive produced the series through her production company Bront√´ Film and Television. In September 2016, it was announced that Tom Burke was set to play Cormoran Strike, and in November 2016 it was announced that Holliday Grainger had been cast as Strike's assistant, Robin Ellacott. Additional cast of the adaptation include Kerr Logan as Matthew Cunliffe, Monica Dolan as Leonora Quine, Lia Williams as Elizabeth Tassel, Jeremy Swift as Owen Quine, Dorothy Atkinson as Kathryn Kent, Dominic Mafham as Jerry Waldegrave, Tim McInnerny as Daniel Chard, Peter Sullivan as Andrew Fancourt, Sargon Yelda as DI Richard Anstis, Sarah Gordy as Orlando Quine and Natasha O'Keeffe as Charlotte Campbell. The two-episode dramatisation of The Silkworm initially aired in September 2017. References Category:2014 British novels Category:Little, Brown and Company books Category:Novels by J. K.

Garc√≠a bats and throws left-handed. Professional career=Minor leagues Born in Ciudad Obreg√≥n, Mexico, Garc√≠a signed as an amateur free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1992 at just sixteen years old. After batting .319 with twenty home runs and 91 runs batted in for the Albuquerque Dukes in 1995, he became the youngest player in Major League Baseball when he debuted with the Dodgers that September. He also received major league calls in 1996 and 1997, but spent most of tenure with the Dodgers as a minor leaguer. In five seasons in their farm system, he compiled a .281 batting average, 98 home runs, and 375 RBIs. His first career home run came off of Osvaldo Fern√°ndez at Candlestick Park in 1997. Arizona Diamondbacks inaugural season On November 18, 1997, the Arizona Diamondbacks selected Garc√≠a as the ninth overall pick in the 1997 Major League Baseball expansion draft. He earned a spot on the D-Backs' inaugural season opening day line-up as the starting right-fielder. Garcia hit the second home run in franchise history in the ninth inning of their 9-2 loss to the Colorado Rockies. Detroit Tigers Following just one season in Arizona, Garc√≠a was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Luis Gonzalez and cash consideration. On May 28, 1999, Garcia became the 34th player in the history of Major League Baseball to hit a home run over the Tiger Stadium roof in right field,The Final Season, p.85, Tom Stanton, Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martin's Press, New York, 2001, however, he lasted just one full season in Detroit. In June 2000, he was sent to the Baltimore Orioles as part of a conditional deal, but was released by Baltimore after one season with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. Cleveland Indians Garcia signed with the Cleveland Indians for the 2001 season, and clubbed 31 home runs for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. He joined the Indians that September, and batted .311 with five home runs in just 45 at-bats. The Indians released Garc√≠a during Spring training 2002. He joined the New York Yankees shortly afterwards only to be released by the Yankees that July and rejoin the Indians. In 51 games for the Tribe, Garc√≠a managed to put up his most impressive stats to date: sixteen home runs, 52 RBIs and a .299 batting average. Garc√≠a's 2002 performance earned him a job as Cleveland's 2003 opening day right fielder, however, a .194 batting average and sloppy play in the outfield caused him to lose his starting job to Jody Gerut by the beginning of May. Shortly afterwards, his contract was purchased by the Yankees. New York Yankees Garc√≠a's numbers improved dramatically upon joining the Yankees, as he batted .305 in 52 games. He also displayed a far steadier glove, committing just two errors. He is likely best remembered for two incidents in the 2003 American League Championship Series at Fenway Park against the rival Boston Red Sox. Following a Hideki Matsui double that gave the Yankees a 4-2 lead in game three, Garc√≠a was plunked with a Pedro Mart√≠nez pitch thrown behind his head. A verbal altercation with Mart√≠nez caused benches to empty, and interrupted play. Shortly afterwards, Mart√≠nez famously told Peter Gammons during an interview on ESPN:Dan Shaughnessy, \\"Speaking his piece on a number of subjects\\", Boston Globe, March 19, 2004. Later in the same game, Garc√≠a jumped into the bullpen to assist Yankees teammate Jeff Nelson in a fight with a groundskeeper. Martinez later referenced his famous quote during the Fenway Park centennial ceremonies, speaking on the microphone to fans before a game against the Yankees in 2012. New York Mets In 2004, Garc√≠a moved cross- town to the New York Mets. His brief tenure with the Mets included him and teammate Shane Spencer involved in a physical altercation with a pizza deliveryman in a parking lot, but no charges were filed.\\"Mets' Garcia, Spencer avoid charges: Players were accused of assaulting pizza-delivery man\\" , AP at MSNBC.com, March 11, 2004. In July, the Mets traded him to the Baltimore Orioles for relief pitcher Mike DeJean. The Orioles released him in August 2004 with a .212 batting average. After Major League Baseball Garc√≠a spent the 2005 and 2006 seasons with the Orix Buffaloes of the Nippon Professional Baseball League, batting a combined .281 with 44 homers and 97 RBIs. Thanks to the advice of Hideki Matsui, he became more patient than before, adapting to his new environment in Japan. On August 10-August 11, 2005, Garc√≠a hit three home runs in two consecutive games against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, becoming the only player in Japanese baseball history to accomplish that. On January 8, 2007, Garc√≠a signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. However, he was released during Spring Training. He ended up joining the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican League for the 2007 season, and batted .374 with 20 home runs to lead his team to a national championship. Garc√≠a signed with the Lotte Giants of the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) for the 2008 season. He played right field, batted fifth, and was one of the crowd favorites in Busan, posting a .283 batting average with 30 home runs and led the league with 111 RBIs in 125 games played. After the season, Garc√≠a won the KBO League Golden Glove Award as an outfielder. Garc√≠a stayed with the Giants through the 2010 season, hitting at least 26 home runs each season he was the with team. In 2011, he returned to the Sultanes de Monterrey in Mexico for a second season with the team. In June 2011, Garc√≠a came back again in South Korea to sign Hanwha Eagles of the KBO. He played for the Eagles until the end of the season. In 2012, he played for the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican Summer League and the Naranjeros de Hermosillo of the Mexican Pacific League. In a ten-season major league career, Garc√≠a posted a .241 batting average with 66 home runs and 212 RBIs in 488 games played. International career Garc√≠a represented his native country, Mexico, as an outfielder on the Mexico national baseball team for the 2006, 2009, and 2013 World Baseball Classic tournaments.

McCallum and published in 1965 by the University of Oklahoma Press. The book covers the history of the development of barbed wire and the inventors. It also include chapters of how it was marketed and the history of its use in the American West. It includes an illustrated identification guide showing the various brands, styles, and patents.  About the Authors  Henry D. McCallum and his wife Frances T. McCallum wrote the book based on the hobby of Henry D. McCallum. McCallum started his collection when he was an oil geologist. When he would inspect in fields, he would notice the fences and recognize the variety of fence styles. He took home a sample and from there his collection grew to a massive size with more than a hundred different kinds of barbed wire. Chapters I. Barbed-Wire Fence-Makers :1. Threshold of Promise :2.

Identification  Reception  The book is one of a narrative monologue that is accredited with exceptional writing and regarded as an excellent reading. Some historians find that the work is not reliable for a reading of exact history. This is due to the secondary sources the author uses instead of any primary sources, and it is mentioned those used are not sufficient enough. Some critiques of the book find that McCallum used some credible sources such as court records, manuscript records of wire companies, family papers, and memoirs of leading figures of the field. The book lacks key elements of discussion such as enclosure practices and fencing laws, as well as economic and social responses and results to the barbed wire. Another issue a critic had was the lack of talk between barbed wire fences and the railroad industry. Editions *Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1965. LC: 65-11234.

The core emphasis in Enshin is use of the Sabaki Method, a system of techniques employed with the goal of turning an opponent's power and momentum against him or her and repositioning oneself to the opponent's \\"blind\\" spot to counterattack from a more advantageous position. Although Enshin is a \\"stand-up fighting\\" style that includes kicks, strikes, and punches found in most other styles of karate, it also utilizes numerous grabs, sweeps, and throws often associated with Judo or other grappling styles of martial arts. Enshin was founded by J≈çk≈ç Ninomiya who directs the Enshin organization from the honbu in Denver, Colorado. The organization is noted for its annual tournament, the Sabaki Challenge, a full-contact, no pads/no gloves, knockdown karate rules competition held annually in Denver and open to advanced martial artists from any style or school.  Meaning of name  Enshin is derived from two Japanese words or kanji: \\"en,\\" meaning \\"open or unfinished circle,\\" and, \\"shin,\\" meaning \\"heart\\" or \\"inner.\\" \\"En\\" relates to the circular movement inherent in the Sabaki Method. However, the circle is \\"open\\" or \\"unfinished\\" to suggest that studying Enshin and Sabaki is a continuous journey, i.e. a process and not an end that is most important. \\"Shin\\" signifies that the Enshin students are not adversaries, but members of a mutually supportive family. \\"Kaikan\\" basically means \\"organization.\\"  History  was born on January 27, 1954, in Yawatahama City, Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, Japan. At age 12 Ninomiya began training in a Judo class taught by a teacher at his junior high school. After turning 14, Ninomiya did extra Judo training at the local police station gym on weekends and holidays. It was there that he met the man who would become his teacher and mentor in karate Hideyuki Ashihara. One year later, in 1969, Ninomiya began training in Ashihara's Kyokushin karate dojo. When Ninomiya was 17, he was chosen to compete in the 1971 All-Japan Tournament as the youngest competitor. Ninomiya subsequently competed in the 1972, 1973, and 1976 All- Japan Tournaments and the 1975 All-World Tournament, making it to the later rounds in all of them. Ultimately, he won the 1978 All-Japan and then retired from tournament competition. In 1973 Ninomiya was selected to go train at the Kyokushin dojo in New York City. He stayed on in New York City as an instructor for several years. In 1977 he moved to Denver and opened his own Kyokushin dojo. In 1980 Hideyuki Ashihara left the Kyokushin organization and started his own style Ashihara Karate. Ninomiya joined Ashihara's organization and directed the US region of Ashihara Karate from Denver. Over the next eight years, Ashihara Karate slowly increased in size in the US and around the world. During this time, Ninomiya states that he had developed strategies and ideas of his own that he was eager to implement in his training curriculum. He also wanted to develop his own tournament format that would provide what he felt to be a ‚Äútrue‚Äù test of karate skills. Therefore, in May, 1988, Ninomiya decided to leave Ashihara Karate and start his own style. Most of the instructors and students of Ashihara in the US decided to follow Ninomiya into his new organization, providing a strong base for the new style Enshin Karate. Since 1988, Enshin Karate has continued to be headquartered at Ninomiya's honbu in Denver. The organization has grown and now includes schools in Asia, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East, as well as in the US. Ninomiya's idea for an open, knockdown-rules tournament that promotes the Sabaki method became the Sabaki Challenge that has been held annually in Denver since 1989.  Technique  The techniques or kihon of Enshin include many of the same or similar kicks, punches, strikes, blocks, and parries found in most other karate styles. However, in contrast to many other karate styles, Enshin also includes sweeps, grabs, throws, and takedowns most often found in judo, Jujutsu, and other grappling styles. The core emphasis in applying all of these techniques is through the Sabaki Method. Perhaps due to Ninomiya's background in Kyokushin, most, if not all, of the Kyokushin striking techniques are found in Enshin. The kicks include front kick, knee kick, roundhouse kick, axe kick, side kick, back kick, and spinning back hook kick. Groin and front-knee-joint kicks are taught for self-defense purposes, but, for safety reasons, aren't used in sparring (kumite) or tournament competition. The arm and hand strikes include forefist straight punch, hook punch, forefist underpunch, knifehand strike (the classic ‚Äúkarate chop‚Äù), and elbow strikes. These strikes can be delivered in a variety of ways. For example, a roundhouse kick can be directed at the lower, middle, or upper areas of the opponent's body. The arms and legs are also used for various blocks and parries. These include the upper block, middle outside parry, lower parry, shin block, and foot stop. Several throws, sweeps, and grabs are taught and often employed in combination with each other. The grabs are either with one or two hands to the opponent's head, neck, shoulder, arm, or leg. The throws include forward-rolling throw, front throw, back throw, and over-the- shoulder throw. The sweeps include foot sweep, inside thigh kick, and back-of- knee-joint kick. Many of the principles of the Sabaki method were developed by Ashihara. The Sabaki method aims to employ all of these strikes, block, parries, grabs, sweeps, throws, and takedowns in a way that puts the opponent on the ground as quickly and efficiently as possible. Once on the ground, the opponent is ‚Äúfinished-off‚Äù or knocked-out with a strike to a vulnerable part of the body such as the neck or head (finish-off moves are simulated in Enshin training or tournament competition). Sabaki strategy combines rhythm, timing, position, and distance to parry and counterattack in one continuous motion. The ability to turn defense into offense by using an opponent's power and momentum against him lies at the heart of the Sabaki method. The basic technique in the Sabaki method is to parry the opponent's attack in a way that redirects their attacking energy away from you. You then move to your opponent's weak side or blind spot that has been opened-up by your parry and execute a strike, throw, sweep, or combination of these to put the opponent on the ground. The combination of movements involve circular or pendulum motions of the body in order to redirect the opponent's attack without meeting it head-on (meeting force with force) and to counterattack with motions that generate energy and momentum. Many of the parries and sweeps are designed to put the opponent off-balance which makes it much easier to knock them to the ground as their own body and momentum assist in carrying him/her to the ground or floor.  Sabaki Challenge  Mike Ninomiya competing in the Sabaki Challenge Since 1989 Enshin Karate has held the Sabaki Challenge (officially called the Sabaki Challenge, World Open Tournament and often unofficially called the World Sabaki Challenge) in Denver, Colorado. The Sabaki Challenge is a full-contact single elimination tournament intended to fulfill Ninomiya's vision of a showcase of a \\"true,\\" stand-up martial arts skills competition. The tournament is open to advanced male and female competitors of any style. The tournament competitors are divided into (male) lightweight, middleweight, heavyweight, and female divisions. The rules of the Sabaki Challenge favor and promote use of the sabaki method including use of grabs (one handed), sweeps and throws, in addition to kicks, punches, and other strikes. A competitor is able to win by knockout of their opponent or by points scored against their opponent. 1 point is awarded for a sweep or takedown. 3 points are awarded for a sweep or takedown followed by a quick simulated strike to the opponent such as a punch. Hand and elbow strikes to the head and neck aren't permitted, but kicks are. Grabs are permitted to one side of the opponent's body for three seconds at a time. Since it is a full-contact tournament, knock-outs do sometimes occur. In addition to the annual Sabaki Challenge in Denver, schools in the US also hold Regional Sabaki tournaments for karateka to compete in full contact tournaments to gain experience and for finalists to apply to compete in the World Sabaki Challenge. An annual Sabaki Challenge is held in Japan called the All Japan Sabaki Challenge tournament. Japan finalists can apply to compete in the World Sabaki Challenge. There are also Regional Sabaki tournaments held in Japan. An annual Sabaki challenge is held in a European country called the International European Sabaki Challenge with finalists able to apply to compete in the World Sabaki Challenge.

Sudbury Secondary School produces a mainstage musical each year (usually in the fall), as well as various other plays, concerts, art exhibits, and dance shows throughout the year. Sudbury Secondary School's F.W. Sheridan Auditorium also plays host to many performances by various organizations, groups, and out-of-town experiences. The school is overseen by the Rainbow District School Board. In December 2007, the School Board's Administrative Council recommended that the school undergo a renewal project. Items recommended for renewal: reducing excess space in the school; more parking for staff, students and visitors; that the guidance office be moved closer to the main office; that the school should become more environmentally friendly; potential movement of the arts departments so that they are closer to each other and to the auditorium, etc. There are also many alterations suggested for the Sheridan Auditorium, such as adding change rooms, and putting in new seats. It is Sudbury's historical high school, with many of its original components still intact. A large marble sign that was placed above the entrance to the first building can still be seen in the courtyard on the school's grounds. Now the school is opened with the new arts wing. Dedicated for all the art students.  Arts Education  The school offers an Arts Education magnet program. Students who are in an arts program have one or more periods each day to develop skills in their field, whether it be dance, theatre arts, vocal music, instrumental music, keyboard, guitar, film or visual arts (fashion, photography, sculpting, etc.). Students are also required to complete the regular academic curriculum (Math, English, Science and French Immersion). Performing opportunities include the annual fall musical, recitals, festivals, and competitions.  Centennial  In 2008, Sudbury Secondary School celebrated its 100th anniversary.

It grows at higher elevations than any other Bornean Nepenthes species, occurring at elevations of over . Nepenthes villosa is characterised by its highly developed and intricate peristome, which distinguishes it from the closely related N. edwardsiana and N. macrophylla.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The specific epithet villosa is Latin for \\"hairy\\" and refers to the dense indumentum of this species. Botanical history Nepenthes villosa was formally described in 1852 by Joseph Dalton Hooker. The description was published in Icones plantarum and accompanied by an illustration.Hooker, J.D. 1852. Nepenthes Villosa. Icones plantarum 9, t. 888. The species was first collected in 1858 by Hugh Low when he made his second ascent of Mount Kinabalu together with Spenser St. John. In an issue of Curtis's Botanical Magazine published in 1858, an illustration of an upper pitcher of N. veitchii was incorrectly identified as N. villosa by J. D. Hooker's father, William Jackson Hooker.Hooker, W.J. 1858. Nepenthes villosa. Curtis's Botanical Magazine 84, t. 5080.Elliot, R.R. 1993. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 22(1‚Äì2): 22‚Äì25. That year, N. villosa was also covered in Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l'Europe by Louis van Houtte, in which the same illustration was reproduced along with the incorrect identification.Houtte, L.v. 1858. Nepenthes villosa Hook. Fil.. Flore des serres et des jardins de l'Europe 13(3): 27. In 1859, N. villosa was again described and illustrated in J. D. Hooker's treatment of the genus published in The Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The illustration and description were reproduced in Spenser St. John's Life in the Forests of the Far East, published in 1862.St. John, S. 1862. Life in the Forests of the Far East; or, Travels in northern Borneo. 2 volumes. London: Smith, Elder & Co.. B. H.

These include two collected by George Darby Haviland from Mount Kinabalu in 1892. One of these, Haviland 1656/1232, was collected at an elevation of . It includes male floral material and is deposited at the Herbarium of the Sarawak Museum. The second specimen, Haviland 1813/1353, was collected from the Marai Parai plateau at an elevation of ; it likely represents N. edwardsiana. It is also deposited at the Herbarium of the Sarawak Museum. It does not include floral material. G. D. Haviland explored the Mount Kinabalu area with his brother H. A.

Description Nepenthes villosa is a weak climber, rarely exceeding in height, although the stem may grow to in length and in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical and up to long. Leaves are coriaceous and petiolate. The lamina is spathulate to oblong and may be up to long and wide. The apex of the lamina is emarginate. The petiole is canaliculate, up to long, and bears an amplexicaul sheath. One to three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Tendrils may reach in length. Climbing plant with pitcher Lower and upper pitchers are very similar. They are urceolate to ovate in shape. The pitchers grow up to high and wide. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§15 mm wide) runs down the front of the pitcher, although it may be reduced to ribs in aerial traps. The pitcher mouth is oblique and elongated into a neck at the rear. The glands on the inner surface are overarched and occur at a density of 200 to 1300 per square cm (30 to 200 per square in). The peristome is cylindrical in cross section and up to wide. It bears well developed teeth and ribs. The lid or operculum is cordate and has a pointed apex. It has a pair of prominent lateral veins. Schmid-Hollinger, R. N.d. Kannendeckel (lid). bio-schmidhol.ch. An unbranched spur, ‚â§ long, is inserted at the base of the lid. Unusual elongated upper pitcher Nepenthes villosa has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle may be up to long, while the rachis grows to in length. Pedicels are filiform-bracteolate and up to long. Sepals are round to elliptic and up to long. A study of 490 pollen samples taken from two herbarium specimens (J.H.Adam 1124 and J.H.Adam 1190, collected at an elevation of ) found the mean pollen diameter to be 37.2 Œºm (SE = 0.2; CV = 6.7%).Adam, J.H. & C.C.

Ecology Nepenthes villosa is endemic to the upper slopes of Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon in Sabah, Borneo. It generally grows at 2300‚Äì3240 m above sea level,McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. the highest elevation of all Bornean Nepenthes species; only N. lamii from New Guinea is found at greater elevations.Robinson, A., J. Nerz, A. Wistuba, M.

In: McPherson, S.R. New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 522‚Äì555. On Mount Kinabalu, N. villosa is common along the Mesilau Trail (between Pondok Magnolia and the meeting point with the old summit trail) and almost all the way up to the Laban Rata rest house;Thong, J. 2006. Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Journal 81: 12‚Äì17. a particularly large population has been reported at around 3047 m.Toyoda, Y. 1972. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 1(4): 62‚Äì63. On Mount Tambuyukon, an altitudinal inversion has been noted, whereby N. villosa is more common at much lower elevations of 1600‚Äì1900 m, being replaced by N. rajah towards the summit. The exposed, uppermost slopes of Mount Tambuyukon can become very hot during the day and this might explain the inability of N. villosa to colonise them. Plants from Mount Tambuyukon generally produce slightly more elongated pitchers.Fretwell, S. 2013. Back in Borneo to see giant Nepenthes. Part 2: Mt Tambuyukon and Poring. Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Journal 108: 6‚Äì15. Nepenthes villosa often grows in mossy forest and sub-alpine forest dominated by species of the genera Dacrydium and Leptospermum, particularly Leptospermum recurvum. It has also been recorded growing among shrubs, grass, and boulders in open areas. Here the soil may become relatively dry, although relative humidity is usually close to 100% as the slopes are often enveloped in clouds. Like many Nepenthes from the Mount Kinabalu area, it is endemic to ultramafic soils. Although many plants grow along Mount Kinabalu's summit trail and are easily accessible to climbers, all known populations of the species grow within Kinabalu National Park and so their collection is illegal. In 1997, Charles Clarke suggested a revised assessment of Conservation Dependent based on this. Clarke writes that N. villosa \\"has a secure future\\", although he adds that climbers have had a significant impact on populations of the species growing along the summit trail, with the number of plants having declined in recent years. A 2002 study found 1180 individual N. villosa growing in 11 plots, each measuring 0.01 hectares, at elevations of between and on Mount Kinabalu. This number constituted 94% of the pitcher plants recorded from the plots, the rest being N. √ó kinabaluensis. Related species Nepenthes villosa is most closely related to N. edwardsiana and N. macrophylla. There has been much taxonomic confusion surrounding the status of these three taxa. Joseph Dalton Hooker, who described both N. edwardsiana and N. villosa, noted the similarity between the two species as follows: > This most remarkable plant [N. villosa] resembles that of edwardsiana in so > many respects, especially in the size, form and disposition of the distant > lamellae of the mouth, that I am inclined to suspect that it may be produced > by young plants of that species, before it arrives at a stage when the > pitchers have elongated necks. G√ºnther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau was the first to treat N. edwardsiana in synonymy with N. villosa when he published his monograph on the genus in 1895. Beck, G. 1895. Die Gattung Nepenthes. Wiener Illustrirte Garten-Zeitung 20(3‚Äì6): 96‚Äì107, 141‚Äì150, 182‚Äì192, 217‚Äì229. In his 1908 monograph, John Muirhead Macfarlane wrote the following with regards to the two species: \\"Examinatione microscopica probatur, illas species distinctas esse\\".Macfarlane, J.M. 1908. Nepenthaceae. In: A. Engler Das Pflanzenreich IV, III, Heft 36: 1‚Äì91. This is probably \\"based on the old belief that plants, which differ anatomically, can not be forms of the same species\\". B. H. Danser united the species \\"[w]ith some hesitation\\" in his 1928 monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\". He suggested that N. villosa is a stunted form of N. edwardsiana from higher elevations, which flowers at a \\"juvenile stage of development\\". Danser acknowledged that the indumentum of N. villosa is more dense than that of N. edwardsiana, but noted that it \\"is a difference only of degree\\". The two taxa differ considerably in their altitudinal distributions. Nepenthes villosa usually occurs at ultrahighland elevations, , whereas N. edwardsiana is found between . Where their altitudinal distributions overlap, they are still identifiable as distinct species. Nepenthes macrophylla was originally described in 1987 as a subspecies of N. edwardsiana by Johannes Marabini.Marabini, J. 1987. Eine neue Unterart von Nepenthes edwardsiana Hook.fil. sowie Anmerkungen zur Taxonomie der Gattung Nepenthes L.. Mitteilungen der Botanischen Staatssammlung M√ºnchen 23: 423‚Äì429. It was later elevated to species status by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. This interpretation was supported by Charles Clarke, who noted that N. edwardsiana and N. villosa \\"have more in common\\" than N. edwardsiana and N. macrophylla. Whereas N. edwardsiana and N. villosa are restricted to the Kinabalu area, N. macrophylla is only found near the summit of Mount Trus Madi. Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek suggest that N. villosa is related to N. mira, a species endemic to Palawan in the Philippines.Schlauer, J. 2000. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 29(2): 53. N. villosa also shows affinities to N. peltata of Mindanao.Kurata, S. 2008. Nepenthes peltata (Nepenthaceae), a New Species of Pitcher Plant from the Philippines. Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society 59(1): 12‚Äì17. Natural hybrids Two natural hybrids involving N. villosa have been recorded. N. edwardsiana √ó N. villosa Lower pitcher of N. √ó harryana Nepenthes √ó harryana is the natural hybrid between N. edwardsiana and N. villosa. Its two parent species are very closely related and so N. √ó harryana, which is intermediate in form, may be difficult to distinguish from either of them. It was originally described as a species in 1882 by Frederick William Burbidge.Burbidge, F.W. 1882. Notes on the new Nepenthes. The Gardeners' Chronicle, new series, 17(420): 56. John Muirhead Macfarlane was the first to realise its hybrid origin and described it as such in his monograph of 1908. Danser wrote that N. √ó harryana could be a hybrid as Macfarlane suggested, or a form of N. villosa together with N. edwardsiana. Nepenthes √ó harryana can be distinguished from N. villosa on the basis of its pitcher morphology. The pitchers of the hybrid are more cylindrical than those of N. villosa, whereas the indumentum is more dense than that of N. edwardsiana. The hip of the pitcher cup, which is found just below the peristome in N. villosa and in the lower quarter of N. edwardsiana pitchers, is located around the middle of N. √ó harryana pitchers. However, N. villosa plants from Mount Tambuyukon are easier to confuse with this hybrid, as they produce pitchers that may be elongated slightly above the hip. Nepenthes √ó harryana is known from a ridge above the Upper Kolopis River and from two locations along the Kinabalu summit trail. Since N edwardsiana does not grow along the summit trail, it cannot be confused with this hybrid there. Burbidge wrote that N. edwardsiana, N. √ó harryana, and N. villosa \\"are quite distinct in zone of the mountain\\". N. rajah √ó N. villosa Lower pitcher of N. √ó kinabaluensis Nepenthes √ó kinabaluensis is the natural hybrid between N. rajah and N. villosa. It was first collected near Kambarangoh on Mount Kinabalu by Lilian Gibbs in 1910 and later mentioned by John Muirhead Macfarlane as \\"Nepenthes sp.\\" in 1914. Although Macfarlane did not formally name the plant, he noted that \\"[a]ll available morphological details suggest that this is a hybrid between N. villosa and N. rajah\\".Macfarlane, J.M. 1914. Nepenthes sp.. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, XLII. It was finally described in 1976 by Shigeo Kurata as N. √ó kinabaluensis. The name was published in Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu, but it is a nomen nudum, as it had an inadequate description and lacked information on the type specimen. The name was subsequently republished by Kurata in 1984Kurata, S. 1984. Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society 35: 65. and by J. H. Adam and C. C. Wilcock in 1998.Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1998 ['1996']. Pitcher plants of Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah. The Sarawak Museum Journal 50(71): 145‚Äì171. Plant with lower pitchers The pitchers of N. √ó kinabaluensis may be quite large, but do not compare to those of N. rajah or N. √ó alisaputrana (N. burbidgeae √ó N. rajah). N. √ó kinabaluensis can only be found on Mount Kinabalu (hence the name) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon, where the two parent species occur sympatrically. More specifically, plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a south-east ridge, which lies on the west side of the Upper Kolopis River.Kurata, S. 1976. Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu. Sabah National Parks Publications No. 2, Sabah National Parks Trustees, Kota Kinabalu. The only accessible location from which this hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail, between Layang-Layang and the helipad, where it grows at about in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium gibbsiae and Leptospermum recurvum trees. N. √ó kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of to .Steiner, H. 2002. Borneo: Its Mountains and Lowlands with their Pitcher Plants. Toihaan Publishing Company, Kota Kinabalu. It grows in open areas in cloud forest. The hybrid is generally intermediate in appearance between its parent species. Raised ribs line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth. These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and smaller than those of N. villosa. The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin (but not scalloped like that of N. rajah), the lid orbiculate or reniform and almost flat. In general, pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about below the leaf tip, a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah.Clarke, C.M. 2001. A Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sabah. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. In older plants, the tendril can be almost woody. N. √ó kinabaluensis is an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins, which is approximately intermediate between the parents. Lower pitchers have two fringed wings, whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these. The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet. N. √ó kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents. In all respects N. √ó kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo. However, it has been confused once before, when the hybrid was misidentified as both N. rajah and N. villosaSchlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes kinabaluensis.

It was subdivided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. History From its earliest days as a British colony, British sterling coinage circulated in Fiji, supplemented by locally produced paper money. During the great depression of the 1930s, the Australian and New Zealand banks devalued their currencies in order to bolster exports to the UK. These banks also controlled the exchange rate for Fiji, and in 1933 the Fiji pound was devalued to ¬£1.2.3 Fijian = ¬£1 Sterling in order to bring it into line with the devalued New Zealand pound, even though the New Zealand pound would very shortly devalue further to bring it into line with the devalued Australian pound. In 1934, as a result of the break in parity with sterling, Fiji began to issue its own coins. When the pound sterling was devalued on 20 November 1967, Fiji immediately followed suit. However, over the next week, Fiji considered the adverse effects that this devaluation would have on imports to Fiji while keeping an eye on how Australia and New Zealand were going to respond to the situation. On 28 November 1967, Fiji decided to partially revalue its pound, hence resulting in a sterling exchange rate of ¬£104.10.0 Fijian = ¬£100 Sterling.Wiley Interscience This had the effect of bringing the Fijian pound closer to its original relationship to the Australian and New Zealand units as existed prior to the upheavals which took place in the exchange rates at the time of the great depression in the 1930s. In 1969, the Fijian pound was replaced by the Fijian dollar at a rate of 1 Fijian pound = 2 Fijian dollars such that the new Fijian dollar was approximately equal to the new dollars in Australia and New Zealand. For a more general view of history in the wider region, see history of pound sterling in Oceania. Coins In 1934, coins were introduced in denominations of ¬Ω, 1 and 6 pence, 1 shilling and 1 florin (2 shillings). A notable absence from this list is the 3 pence denomination which existed in all other territories which used sterling coinage. The absence of a 3 pence coin was a matter of considerable controversy. The larger denomination Fiji coins were the same size as the corresponding British coins, whereas the ¬Ω and 1 penny cupro-nickel coins were smaller and had holes in them. In 1942 and 1943, coins were produced for Fiji at the San Francisco mint, resulting in brass ¬Ω and 1 penny coins and 90% silver 6 pence, shilling and florin coins. In 1947, a nickel-brass dodecagonal 3 pence coin of identical size and shape to the corresponding sterling coin was finally introduced. Cupro-nickel replaced silver between 1953 and 1957. Banknotes In 1871, 1 pound notes were issued at Levuka on the island of Ovalau. These were followed in 1873 by notes of the Fiji Banking and Commercial Company in denominations of 5 and 10 shillings and 1 and 5 pounds. The Bank of New Zealand introduced notes in 1876 in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 pounds, followed by 10 shillings notes in 1918. Bank of New South Wales issued 1 pound notes in 1901. In 1914, the Fijian government Currency Board introduced its own banknotes: 1, 5, 10 and 20 pound denominations which were printed by Thomas de la Rue in Londonhttp://www.rbf.gov.fj/docs/Reserve%20Bank%20of%20Fiji.pdf. Due to wartime conditions creating a shortage of silver, 10 shillings notes were introduced in 1918, followed by 5 shillings in 1920. All notes of this first issue have a guilloche and scrollwork design, while lacking a vignette. Also in 1920, the private trading banknotes of the Bank of New Zealand and Bank of New South Wales were withdrawn from circulation. A new design second issue of all denominations featuring the portrait of King George V were introduced in 1934. Apart from revised portraits of the reigning monarch, these notes were largely the same design until 1969. Emergency issues were also made during World War II for 1 penny, 1 and 2 shillings.

Vis and RƒÅmin (, Vis o RƒÅmin) is a classical Persian love story. The epic was composed in poetry by Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani (or \\"Gorgani\\") in the 11th century. Gorgani claimed a Sassanid origin for the story, but it is now regarded as of Parthian dynastic origin, probably from the 1st century AD.\\"Vis o Ramin\\". Encyclopaedia Iranica. It has also been suggested that Gorgani's story reflects the traditions and customs of the period immediately before he himself lived. That cannot be ruled out, as stories retold from ancient sources often include elements drawn from the time of their narrator.Dick Davis (January 6, 2005), \\"Vis o RƒÅmin\\", in: Encyclopaedia Iranica Online Edition. Accessed on April 4, 2010. Framework The framework of the story is the opposition of two Parthian ruling houses, one in the west and the other in the east. Gorgani originally belongs to Hyrcania which is one of main lands of Parthians. The existence of these small kingdoms and the feudalistic background point to a date in the Parthian period of Iranian history. The popularity of this pre- Islamic story in the Islamic period is mentioned by the poet himself, and shows that there was a demand for ancient themes and traditional lore.  Synopsis  Vis and Ramin, Les Ballets Persans. Choreography by Nima Kiann. Tirgan Festival. Harbourfront Centre, Toronto. 2011 The story is about Vis, the daughter of ShƒÅhr≈´ and KƒÅren, the ruling family of MƒÅh (Media) in western Iran, and Ramin (RƒÅmƒ´n), the brother to Mobed Monikan, the King of Marv in northeastern Iran. Monikan sees Shahru in a royal gala, wonders at her beauty, and asks her to marry him. She answers that she is already married, but she promises to give him her daughter if a girl is born to her. Shahru gives birth to a girl and calls her Vis (or Viseh). She sends the infant to Khuzan to be raised by a wet-nurse who also happens to be raising Ramin, who is the same age as Vis. They grow up together. When Vis reaches adolescence, she returns to her mother, who marries Vis to her brother Viru. The marriage remains unconsummated because of Vis' menstruation, which by Zoroastrian law makes her unapproachable. Mobad Monikan finds out about the marriage celebration and sends his brother Zard to remind Shahru of her promise to give him Vis as his wife. Vis rejects Monikan's request and refuses to go. An aggrieved Monikan leads an army against MƒÅh-abad. Vis's father, QƒÅrin, is killed in the ensuing conflict, but Monikan also suffers a defeat from Viru. Monikan then takes his army to Gurab, where Vis is waiting the outcome of the battle. He sends a messenger to her, offering her various privileges in return for marrying him. Vis rejects Monikan's offer proudly and indignantly. Monikan asks advice from his two brothers Zard and Ramin. Ramin, who is already in love with Vis, attempts to dissuade Monikan from trying to marry her. However, Monikan's brother Zard suggests bribing Shahru as a way of winning over Vis. Mobad sends money and jewels to Shahru and bribes her to gain entry to the castle. He then takes Vis away, much to the chagrin of Viru. On the journey back to Marv, Ramin catches a glimpse of Vis and is consumed with love for her, so much so that he falls off his horse and faints. Vis is given residence in the harem of Mobad and gifts are bestowed upon her. Vis's nurse also follows her to Marv, and attempts to persuade her to behave pragmatically, accept Monikan and forget Viru. Vis at first has a hard time accepting her fate, but eventually resigns herself to life in the harem. Still mourning her father's death and her kidnapping, Vis refuses to give herself to Monikan for a year. Her nurse makes a talisman that renders Monikan impotent for one month. The spell can be broken only if the talisman is broken, and it is swept away in a flood and lost, so that Mobad is never able to sleep with his bride. Meanwhile, after many attempts to contact Vis, Ramin finally meets with her and the two consummate their love while Monikan is away at war. When Monikan returns, he overhears a conversation between the nurse and Vis, and realizes his wife loves Ramin. Monikan demands that Vis prove her chastity by undergoing trial by fire. But Vis and Ramin elope. Monikan's mother makes peace between Ramin and the king, and they all go back to Marv. Monikan takes Ramin along on a campaign against the Romans but Ramin falls sick and is left behind. Ramin goes back to Vis, who is imprisoned in a castle by Monikan and guarded by the king's other brother Zard. Ramin scales the wall and spends his time with Vis until Monikan comes back from the war and Ramin escapes. Ramin thinks that his love with Vis has no future, so he asks Monikan to send him to Maah on a mission. There, Ramin falls in love with a woman called Gol and marries her. Vis finds about this and sends her nurse to Ramin to remind him of their love. Ramin sends back a harsh reply. Vis sends an elaborate message pleading with him to come back. At this time, Ramin was bored from his married life and after he receives the second message he goes back to Vis. But when he reaches Marv on his horseback in a snow storm, Vis goes to the roof of the castle and rejects his love. Ramin goes off desperately. Vis regrets what she has done and sends the nurse after Ramin. They reconcile. Monikan takes Ramin hunting and Vis and the nurse with some other women attend a fire temple nearby. Ramin leaves the hunt, disguises himself as a woman to enter the temple, and flees with Vis. They go back to the castle and, with help from Ramin's men, kill the garrison and Zard as well. They then escaped to Dailam, on the coast of the Caspian Sea. Monikan is killed by a boar during the hunt. Vis and Ramin come back to Merv and Ramin sits on the throne as the king and marries Vis. Ramin reigns for 83 years. In the 81st year Vis dies and Ramin hands over the kingdom to his eldest son with Vis and goes and mourn on Vis' tomb for 2 years, after which he joins her in the afterlife.  Influence  A Persianate miniature from the 1729 manuscript of the Georgian adaptation of Vis and RƒÅmin. The Vis and Ramin story had a noticeable influence on Persian literature. Significantly, Nezami, himself a major poet of Persian romantic traditions, took the bases of much of his rhetoric from Gorgani. The romance also has had its influence beyond Persian culture. The story became very popular also in Georgia through a 12th-century free translation in prose known as Visramiani, which had a longlasting effect on the Georgian literature. Being the oldest known manuscript of the work and better preserved than the original, it is of great importance for the history of the Persian text and helps restore several corrupted lines in the Persian manuscripts.Gvakharia, Aleksandre \\"Georgia IV: Literary contacts with Persia\\"], in: Encyclopaedia Iranica Online Edition. Accessed on April 4, 2010 at The great scholar Vladimir Minorsky did a four-part study of the story and was convinced of its Parthian origin. Some scholars have suggested that Vis and Ramin may have influenced the Tristan and Iseult legend, and the two plots have distinct resemblances. Nevertheless, views have differed about the connection between these two stories.George Morrison, Julian Baldick et al.

Licor 43, or Cuarenta y Tres (Spanish for \\"43\\"), is a Spanish liqueur, made in Cartagena, Spain. History It was invented in 1946 by Diego Zamora, along with his brother and sister, Angel and Josefina Zamora, and Emilio Restoy, Josefina's husband. The Licor 43 website states they based their recipe on the Liqvor Mirabilis (marvellous liquid), a golden, aromatic elixir produced and infused from local fruits and herbs in Carthago Nova during the 3rd century. Liqvor Mirabilis was encountered by the Romans when they conquered the region in 209 BC; despite the Romans banning its production and consumption, the Carthaginians continued producing in secret. This legend served as the inspiration for the Zamora's invention of Licor 43. The name of the modern-day liqueur originates from its use of 43 different ingredients; while its recipe is a closely guarded secret by the Zamora family, it is known to contain citrus and fruit juices, and to be flavoured with vanilla, among other aromatic herbs and spices. Culinary properties It is 31% abv (62 proof) and is a sweet liqueur that is thick- bodied with a dense mouthfeel when sipped neat at room temperature. Visually it is golden-yellow. The aroma is sharp, warm, and complex; the initial scent of citrus and vanilla is balanced by nuances of tangy fruit, subtle notes of cocoa, and an aged rum-like warmth. The taste is warm, creamy, and smooth, with flavours similar to the aroma: an emphatic vanilla beginning, hints of cocoa and other intermixed spices, sweet fruits, and tangy citrus, all carried by a flavour akin to aged rum. It has a long, sweet finish on the tongue, with persistent notes of vanilla, toffee, dark chocolate and fresh fruit. Commercial performance It is said to be the most sold liqueur in Spain. As of 2011, it is now the fastest growing premium liqueur in the world in its category, and is present in more than 60 countries. During a 2015 inquiry into the best-selling alcohols in The World's 50 Best Bars (the bar version of William Reed's The World's 50 Best Restaurants), Licor 43 was ranked as the 9th best-selling digestif worldwide. According to the International Wines and Spirits Record (IWSR), a data analytics company that tracks alcoholic beverage trends and measures country, category, and brand performance, Licor 43 was the fastest growing liquor of scale globally in 2017. Uses and variations M√©xican carajillos specifically call for \\"licor del 43\\" as the alcohol combined with espresso and ice. In the Canary Islands, it is an essential ingredient for a Barraquito, a variant of the highly popular cortado condensada (espresso with condensed milk) coffee. A \\"mini-beer\\" is a Licor 43 cocktail designed to visually imitate a beer. A miniature pint glass is mostly filled with Licor 43 and topped with a chilled dairy-based liquid, such as heavy cream or Irish Cream. The colour of Licor 43 mimics the amber colour of a pale beer, and the dairy product mimics the white colour of a beer's foamy head. A common cocktail variation in Mexico is the ‚ÄúSandrillo‚Äù which was invented back in 2017 and includes licor 43 shaken with whole milk.

Black/Blue lines represent wave peaks. White spaces between lines represent troughs. image:FringesEx1.gif Yellow areas produce bright lines of constructive interference. The dark areas produce dark lines of destructive interference. In interferometry experiments such as the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, a fringe shift is the behavior of a pattern of ‚Äúfringes‚Äù when the phase relationship between the component sources change. A fringe pattern can be created in a number of ways but the stable fringe pattern found in the Michelson type interferometers is caused by the separation of the original source into two separate beams and then recombining them at differing angles of incidence on a viewing surface. The interaction of the waves on a viewing surface alternates between constructive interference and destructive interference causing alternating lines of dark and light. In the example of a Michelson Interferometer, a single fringe represents one wavelength of the source light and is measured from the center of one bright line to the center of the next. The physical width of a fringe is governed by the difference in the angles of incidence of the component beams of light, but regardless of a fringe's physical width, it still represents a single wavelength of light.  Discovery  center This animation shows the angled beam's phase moving ahead of the reference beams causing a constant fringe shift to the left. In the 1887 Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, the speed that the two beams traveled down the perpendicular arms was expected to be altered by an apparent aether wind caused by the Earth's motion through the luminiferous aether. This time difference was calculated to result in a phase shift of 0.4 wavelengths. This means that as the interferometer's arms were spun to face into and against the ether wind, the vertical fringe lines should have moved across the viewer 0.4 fringe widths left and right for a total of 0.8 fringes from maximum to minimum. Michelson reported that only between one- sixth and one-quarter of the expected reading was found.

The Circuit encompassed the whole of the North of England but in 1876 it was divided. That part to the west of the Pennines retained the old name. The land to the east became the territory of the newly formed North Eastern Circuit. The two circuits have maintained strong links. The Northern Circuit stretches from Carlisle in Cumbria at its northernmost point, running through Lakeland to the port of Whitehaven in the West, on through Preston and Burnley in Lancashire to Manchester, Liverpool and Chester. In 1876, 62 members of the Bar had chambers on the circuit. There were 29 in Liverpool, 32 in Manchester and 1 solitary practitioner in Preston. Today the circuit has a membership of some 1100 barristers of whom about 77 are Queen's Counsel, practising from chambers in Manchester, Liverpool, Preston and Chester. They follow on from a long line of Counsel who have become household names such as F. E. Smith (later to become Lord Birkenhead), Lord Shawcross QC (Leading Counsel at the Nuremberg Trials after World War II) and George Carman QC. There have been other Circuiteers who have attained fame outside the law - the author John Buchan, W. S. Gilbert and James Boswell, the biographer of Dr. Samuel Johnson. Boswell was Junior of the Circuit. Since 1876 the Circuit which presently comprises 10 per cent of the Bar has produced the following judges: * President of the Supreme Court 1 *Lord Chancellors 3 *Law Lords 7 *Lord Chief Justices 3 * President of Queen's Bench Division 1 *Master of the Rolls 3 *Presidents, Probate, Divorce & Admiralty 5 * Senior President of Tribunals 1 *Lords Justice of Appeal 28 *Lady Justice of Appeal 2 *High Court Judges 92 During 2001, one Law Lord, three Lord Justices of Appeal (including the Vice President of the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division), one Lady Justice of Appeal and 12 High Court Judges were members of the Northern Circuit. In 1994, of the five female High Court Judges, four were Northern Circuiteers. Rose Heilbron QC was the first female High Court judge from the Circuit, 20 years earlier.

Villa Mondragone. Postcard of Villa Mondragone at the beginning of the 20th century. Villa Mondragone is a patrician villa originally in the territory of the Italian comune of Frascati (Latium, central Italy), now in the territory of Monte Porzio Catone (Alban Hills). It lies on a hill 416m above sea-level, in an area called, from its many castles and villas, Castelli Romani about southeast of Rome, near the ancient town of Tusculum. Construction began in 1573 by Cardinal Mark Sittich von Hohenems Altemps, who commissioned the design for it and for the Palazzo Altemps in central Rome from Martino Longhi the Elder, on the site of the remains of a Roman villa of the consular family of the Quinctilii. Pope Gregory XIII, whose heraldic dragon led to calling the villa \\"Mondragone\\", used the villa regularly as a summer residence, as guest of Cardinal Altemps. It was at the Villa Mondragone that in 1582, Gregory promulgated the document (the papal bull \\"Inter gravissimas\\") which initiated the reform of the calendar now in use and known as the Gregorian calendar. Villa Mondragone was at its maximum splendour during the epoch of the Borghese family (including Cardinal Scipione Borghese and Pope Paul V), who exhibited parts of their art and antiquities collections there (including the Antinous Mondragone which derives its name from the villa). Other popes who passed long periods in Villa Mondragone include Clement VIII and Paul V. In 1620, the owners of the villa bequeathed the Mondragone library to the Vatican library. Starting from 1626, Pope Urban VIII decided to leave Villa Mondragone in favour of the Papal residence of Castelgandolfo. In 1858 George Sand was guest in the villa, and found there a suitable atmosphere for the setting of her novel La Daniella. In 1865 the Jesuits turned it into a college, the Nobile Collegio Mondragone, for young aristocrats, which operated until 1953. During the Second World War the college was also used as a shelter for evacuees. In 1981 it was sold by the Order of the Jesuits to the University, where as of modern times, the Villa remains a peripheral seat of the University of Rome Tor Vergata. In 1912 Wilfrid Michael Voynich acquired the famous Voynich manuscript from the Jesuits at the Villa Mondragone. The facility, in need of funds, was discreetly selling some of its holdings. Voynich purchased 30 manuscripts, one of which was later to be known as the Voynich manuscript, though the work itself purportedly dates to the early 15th century. There is, however, dissent among researchers as to its origin. ReferencesSources * Tracy Lee Ehrlich: Landscape and Identity in Early Modern Rome.

CCHS was founded in 1923 and is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. History As early as 1869, Sacred Heart Church (founded in 1815) had established a parochial school and conducted primary grades irregularly throughout the late 1800s. In 1903, the Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity, of Stella Niagara, New York, assumed administration of the school. In 1923, Sacred Heart added high school grades in the former Chilton house in downtown Charleston and named the institution Sacred Heart High School. In 1940, John J. Swint, the bishop of the then Diocese of Wheeling, created Charleston Catholic High School. Area Catholics contributed to the construction of a three-story building, including science laboratories and a gymnasium, completed in 1941. Post-war growth of Charleston led to the expansion of the school and the addition of a third floor in the 1950s. Enrollment peaked in the late 1960s and then began a slow decline in the mid-1980s. In 1986, Father P. Edward Sadie, a local priest, hired Debra K. Sullivan as the principal. Enrollment rebounded through the 1990s. In 1994 a new math and science wing opened. In 2000, Charleston Catholic purchased and renovated the Players Club tennis building, adding basketball, volleyball, and training facilities.A Brief History of CCHS, 1 May 2012 At the end of the 2013-14 school year and after 28 years as principal, Debra Sullivan announced her retirement, to be replaced by Colleen McCartney Hoyer of the CCHS graduating class of 1994, who previously served as Assistant Principal for Student Affairs.Official May 2014 Newsletter, 2 May 2013Fall 2012 Alumni Newsletter, October-November 2012 Enrollment Charleston Catholic enrolls both Christian and non-Christian students from a wide range of ethnic, racial, and socio-economic backgrounds. Students are required to follow a uniform policy. CCHS boasts a rigorous college preparatory program for all students with an extensive offering of academic, athletic, and extracurricular programs. Its athletic teams compete with public and parochial schools in the WVSSAC Division A. Typically, 100 percent of graduating classes enroll in four-year colleges and universities. Mission In the context of a Christian Community, Charleston Catholic High School strives to help students fulfill the potential of their God-given talents and abilities and to guide them in developing themselves in all areas: spiritually, intellectually, physically, aesthetically, and socially. Staff, students, and parents work together to develop a community of shared values based on respect and concern for self and others while at the same time guiding students to use their gifts and values to better the world in which they live. Awards and recognition Charleston Catholic High School was named as having the top athletics program in West Virginia for 2008-2009 school year by Sports Illustrated. In 2013, 65% of students in grades 9 through 12 took at least one AP exam, many taking more than one, with a total of 260 exams taken by CCHS students. Over 61.5% of the Class of 2013 took and passed an AP exam during their high school careers.Official August 2013 Newsletter, 8 August 2013 The same year, 13% of the Senior Class of 2014 were named National Merit Semi-Finalists.National Merit semifinalists from W.Va. named, 11 September 2013 Members of the Charleston Catholic High School Class of 2009 were accepted and enrolled in some of the country's finest universities (including Washington University in Saint Louis, Princeton University, Harvard University, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania), had eight national merit finalists in a graduating class of only 69, and were ACRE champions. 38% of the graduating class were honored as AP scholars.

The name and design of the flag is in the theory advocated by several authorsDictionnaire des antiquit√©s grecques et romaines - Daremberg et Saglio 1920. of a relationship between the genesis of labarum and the military standard called Cantabrum, thereby identifying both as a same thing; and the alleged relationship the Codex Theodosianus established between the Labarum and the Cantabrarii, the school of Roman soldiers in charge of carrying the Cantabrum. Additionally, and according to the definition of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, labarum is the Roman standard (as in military ceremonial flag) on which, under Emperor Constantin's rule, the cross and the Monogram of Christ (XP: Chi-Rho) was drawn. By association of ideas, labarum can refer just to the monogram itself, or even just the cross.

Virginia Episcopal School's campus is located above the James River in Lynchburg along the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. History Virginia Episcopal School's early benefactor, Viscountess Astor, the first female member of British Parliament, donated much of the school's initial endowment while visiting her family home, Mirador, in Albemarle County. Lady Astor maintained a keen interest in the school for the rest of her life and was instrumental in having her father Chiswell Langhorne donate the school chapel in memory of his wife Nancy Witcher Keene (parents of Lady Astor). and Accompanying photo Virginia Episcopal School opened its doors to students in September 1916. Jett Hall was completed the same year under the direction of Frederick H. Brooke, a prominent Washington architect. Pendleton Hall was completed in 1918, enabling enrollment to be increased from sixty-three to one-hundred eleven boys. In 1919, Langhorne Memorial Chapel was consecrated. This was followed by the opening of Barksdale Gymnasium in 1920. As bishop of the newly-created Diocese of Southwest Virginia, Bishop Jett would serve ex officio as chairman of the school's board of trustees until his retirement in 1938. Originally all-white, the school was racially integrated in 1967, when the first two black students entered the school in a successful initiative organized by the Stouffer Foundation, which also arranged the integration of other elite prep schools in the South, including Saint Andrew's School in Florida, the Asheville School in North Carolina, and the Westminster School in Georgia.Mosi Secret, 'The Way to Survive It Was to Make A's', New York Times Magazine (September 7, 2017).

Each island stronghold contains 15 radar installations...all fifteen must be taken down before Agent 006¬Ω can make his way into the D.V.S. fortress on the island, where the blueprints are held. Mission 1: The Hunt for Red Rock Rover The first island stronghold. Agent 006¬Ω parachutes in, and after a successful mission, takes a hidden boat to the second island. Mission 2: Kill Again Island The second island stronghold. After a successful mission, Agent 006¬Ω slips away in scuba gear. Mission 3: Dr. No Body The third island stronghold, where Agent 006¬Ω will have to do battle with the head of the D.V.S. Gameplay The player controls the titular secret agent, known only under his codename \\"Agent 006¬Ω\\". Each game is divided into 16 levels; there is no fixed order in which to play them, but the \\"main fortress\\" cannot be accessed until the other 15 levels have all been completed. Each level is a labyrinthine structure. The objective in each level is to locate and destroy a radar dish, then exit the level. A bundle of dynamite is needed to blow open the exit doors. Agent 006¬Ω is typically hindered by locked doors which require keys to be opened; laser beams which kill instantly, block access to areas of the level, and must be deactivated by finding a floppy disk and bringing it to a computer terminal; human and robotic enemies, most of which can be killed with Agent 006¬Ω's rifle; and environmental hazards such as spikes or pools of acid and water. Agent 006¬Ω begins a level with three health points. If he loses all three, he dies, and the level restarts, with the player's score reset to what he began the level with. Enemies and certain hazards detract one health point when they hit Agent 006¬Ω, while others (such as landmines) kill him instantly. The player may need to make use of pushable barrels to reach higher areas. Some of the levels also contain special goggles, which, when collected, cause a number of platforms to become visible, allowing access to previously unreachable areas. Power-ups include ammunition, sneakers that increase Agent 006¬Ω's speed for a short duration, and a gun which allows faster shooting. There are also items which merely give points. When a human enemy is killed, he is replaced by a gravestone; the player can either destroy it (earning 100 points) or pay his respects (earning 1,000 points). Each level also includes the letters \\"S\\", \\"P\\" and \\"Y\\". The player is awarded 10,000 points if he picks them up in the right order, and 25,000 points if he completes the level without taking any damage. There are also items that cause ailments like a ¬Ω item that slows Agent 006¬Ω's speed for a short duration, and a question mark which reverses the function of the left and right keys for a short duration. Cultural references The names of the episodes are references to popular movies and television shows: \\"The Hunt for Red Rock Rover\\" is a pun on the film The Hunt for Red October, \\"Kill Again Island\\" is a play on Gilligan's Island and \\"Dr. No Body\\" is a reference to the film Dr. No. The default high score list consists of popular fictional spies such as Jim Phelps and Maxwell Smart.

Other denominations were the puli (\\"copper\\") of 5 dinar and the bisti of 20 dinar. Though the Iranian abbasi was widespread in eastern Georgia, it was initially minted in mainland Iran (i.e. Tabriz). When the abbasi came to be minted at the royal mint in Tiflis (Tbilisi), they became colloquially known as abazi. These abazi coins at first weighed 7.8 grams but by the end of the 18th century their weight reportedly declined to just 3 grams. Coins featured, except the Islamic profession of faith (shahada) and/or the names of the Shiite Imams on the front, the name of the Iranian shah and the date on the reverse. After the absorption of Georgia into the Russian Empire in 1801, the currency was not immediately replaced by the Russian ruble. Instead, a final issue of coins was made between 1804 and 1833 in denominations of 5, 10 and 20 dinar in copper and 100, 200 and 400 dinar in silver. These were related to the Russian currency at a rate of 10 dinar to the kopeck. The Russian ruble was introduced in 1833 at a rate of 5 abazi = 1 ruble.

It does so by converting the variable attenuation of light waves (as they pass through or reflect off objects) into signals, small bursts of current that convey the information. The waves can be light or other electromagnetic radiation. Image sensors are used in electronic imaging devices of both analog and digital types, which include digital cameras, camera modules, camera phones, optical mouse devices, medical imaging equipment, night vision equipment such as thermal imaging devices, radar, sonar, and others. As technology changes, electronic and digital imaging tends to replace chemical and analog imaging. The two main types of electronic image sensors are the charge-coupled device (CCD) and the active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor). Both CCD and CMOS sensors are based on metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) technology, with CCDs based on MOS capacitors and CMOS sensors based on MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) amplifiers. Analog sensors for invisible radiation tend to involve vacuum tubes of various kinds. Digital sensors include flat-panel detectors. CCD vs. CMOS sensors A micrograph of the corner of the photosensor array of a webcam digital camera Image sensor (upper left) on the motherboard of a The two main types of digital image sensors are the charge-coupled device (CCD) and the active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor), fabricated in complementary MOS (CMOS) or N-type MOS (NMOS or Live MOS) technologies. Both CCD and CMOS sensors are based on MOS technology, with MOS capacitors being the building blocks of a CCD, and MOSFET amplifiers being the building blocks of a CMOS sensor. Cameras integrated in small consumer products generally use CMOS sensors, which are usually cheaper and have lower power consumption in battery powered devices than CCDs. CCD sensors are used for high end broadcast quality video cameras, and (C)MOS sensors dominate in still photography and consumer goods where overall cost is a major concern. Both types of sensor accomplish the same task of capturing light and converting it into electrical signals. Each cell of a CCD image sensor is an analog device. When light strikes the chip it is held as a small electrical charge in each photo sensor. The charges in the line of pixels nearest to the (one or more) output amplifiers are amplified and output, then each line of pixels shifts its charges one line closer to the amplifier(s), filling the empty line closest to the amplifiers(s). This process is then repeated until all the lines of pixels have had their charge amplified and output. A CMOS image sensor has an amplifier for each pixel compared to the few amplifiers of a CCD. This results in less area for the capture of photons than a CCD, but this problem has been overcome by using microlenses in front of each photodiode, which focus light into the photodiode that would have otherwise hit the amplifier and not been detected. Some CMOS imaging sensors also use Back-side illumination to increase the number of photons that hit the photodiode. CMOS sensors can potentially be implemented with fewer components, use less power, and/or provide faster readout than CCD sensors. They are also less vulnerable to static electricity discharges. Another design, a hybrid CCD/CMOS architecture (sold under the name \\"sCMOS\\") consists of CMOS readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that are bump bonded to a CCD imaging substrate ‚Äì a technology that was developed for infrared staring arrays and has been adapted to silicon-based detector technology.scmos.com , home page Another approach is to utilize the very fine dimensions available in modern CMOS technology to implement a CCD like structure entirely in CMOS technology: such structures can be achieved by separating individual poly-silicon gates by a very small gap; though still a product of research hybrid sensors can potentially harness the benefits of both CCD and CMOS imagers.ieee.org - CCD in CMOS Padmakumar R. Rao et al., \\"CCD structures implemented in standard 0.18 ¬µm CMOS technology\\" Performance There are many parameters that can be used to evaluate the performance of an image sensor, including dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, and low-light sensitivity. For sensors of comparable types, the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range improve as the size increases. Exposure-time control Exposure time of image sensors is generally controlled by either a conventional mechanical shutter, as in film cameras, or by an electronic shutter. Electronic shuttering can be \\"global\\", in which case the entire image sensor area's accumulation of photoelectrons starts and stops simultaneously, or \\"rolling\\" in which case the exposure interval of each row immediate precedes that row's readout, in a process that \\"rolls\\" across the image frame (typically from top to bottom in landscape format). Global electronic shuttering is less common, as it requires \\"storage\\" circuits to hold charge from the end of the exposure interval until the readout process gets there, typically a few milliseconds later. Color separation Bayer pattern on sensor Foveon's scheme of vertical filtering for color sensing There are several main types of color image sensors, differing by the type of color-separation mechanism: * Bayer-filter sensor, low-cost and most common, using a color filter array that passes red, green, and blue light to selected pixel sensors. Each individual sensor element is made sensitive to red, green, or blue by means of a color gel made of chemical dyes patterned over the elements. The most common filter matrix, the Bayer pattern, uses two green pixels for each red and blue. This results in less resolution for red and blue colors. The missing color samples may interpolated using a demosaicing algorithm, or ignored altogether by lossy compression. In order to improve color information, techniques like color co-site sampling use a piezo mechanism to shift the color sensor in pixel steps. * Foveon X3 sensor, using an array of layered pixel sensors, separating light via the inherent wavelength-dependent absorption property of silicon, such that every location senses all three color channels. This method is similar to how color film for photography works. * 3CCD, using three discrete image sensors, with the color separation done by a dichroic prism. The dichroic elements provide a sharper color separation, thus improving color quality. Because each sensor is equally sensitive within its passband, and at full resolution, 3-CCD sensors produce better color quality and better low light performance. 3-CCD sensors produce a full 4:4:4 signal, which is preferred in television broadcasting, video editing and chroma key visual effects. Specialty sensors Infrared view of the Orion Nebula taken by ESO's HAWK-I, a cryogenic wide-field imager Special sensors are used in various applications such as thermography, creation of multi-spectral images, video laryngoscopes, gamma cameras, sensor arrays for x-rays, and other highly sensitive arrays for astronomy. While in general digital cameras use a flat sensor, Sony prototyped a curved sensor in 2014 to reduce/eliminate Petzval field curvature that occurs with a flat sensor. Use of a curved sensor allows a shorter and smaller diameter of the lens with reduced elements and components with greater aperture and reduced light fall- off at the edge of the photo. History Early analog sensors for visible light were video camera tubes. They date back to the 1930s, and several types were developed up until the 1980s. By the early 1990s, they had been replaced by modern solid-state CCD image sensors. The basis for modern solid-state image sensors is MOS technology, which originates from the invention of the MOSFET by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. Later research on MOS technology led to the development of solid-state semiconductor image sensors, including the charge-coupled device (CCD) and later the active- pixel sensor (CMOS sensor). The passive-pixel sensor (PPS) was the precursor to the active-pixel sensor (APS). A PPS consists of passive pixels which are read out without amplification, with each pixel consisting of a photodiode and a MOSFET switch. It is a type of photodiode array, with pixels containing a p-n junction, integrated capacitor, and MOSFETs as selection transistors. A photodiode array was proposed by G. Weckler in 1968. This was the basis for the PPS. These early photodiode arrays were complex and impractical, requiring selection transistors to be fabricated within each pixel, along with on-chip multiplexer circuits. The noise of photodiode arrays was also a limitation to performance, as the photodiode readout bus capacitance resulted in increased noise level. Correlated double sampling (CDS) could also not be used with a photodiode array without external memory. Charge-coupled device The charge-coupled device (CCD) was invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. While researching MOS technology, they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor. As it was fairly straighforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row, they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next. The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting. Early CCD sensors suffered from shutter lag. This was largely resolved with the invention of the pinned photodiode (PPD). It was invented by Nobukazu Teranishi, Hiromitsu Shiraki and Yasuo Ishihara at NEC in 1980. It was a photodetector structure with low lag, low noise, high quantum efficiency and low dark current. In 1987, the PPD began to be incorporated into most CCD devices, becoming a fixture in consumer electronic video cameras and then digital still cameras. Since then, the PPD has been used in nearly all CCD sensors and then CMOS sensors. Active-pixel sensor The NMOS active-pixel sensor (APS) was invented by Olympus in Japan during the mid-1980s. This was enabled by advances in MOS semiconductor device fabrication, with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub-micron levels. The first NMOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura's team at Olympus in 1985. The CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) was later developed by Eric Fossum's team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993. By 2007, sales of CMOS sensors had surpassed CCD sensors. By the 2010s, CMOS sensors largely displaced CCD sensors in all new applications. Other image sensors New iPad includes lidar sensor The first commercial digital camera, the Cromemco Cyclops in 1975, used a 32√ó32 MOS image sensor. It was a modified MOS dynamic RAM (DRAM) memory chip. MOS image sensors are widely used in optical mouse technology. The first optical mouse, invented by Richard F. Lyon at Xerox in 1980, used a 5¬µm NMOS integrated circuit sensor chip. Since the first commercial optical mouse, the IntelliMouse introduced in 1999, most optical mouse devices use CMOS sensors. In February 2018, researchers at Dartmouth College announced a new image sensing technology that the researchers call QIS, for Quanta Image Sensor. Instead of pixels, QIS chips have what the researchers call \\"jots.\\" Each jot can detect a single particle of light, called a photon.

After Attila's death in 453 AD, his Empire crumbled and its remains were ruled by his three sons, Ellac, Dengizich and Ernak. He succeeded his older brother Ellac in 454 AD, and probably ruled simultaneously over the Huns in dual kingship with his brother Ernak, but separate divisions in separate lands. History The oldest brother Ellac died in 454 AD, at the Battle of Nedao. Jordanes recorded \\"When Ellac was slain, his remaining brothers were put to fight near the shore of the Sea of Pontus where we have said the Goths settled ... dwelling again in their ancient abodes\\". Jordanes recounts events in c. 454-455: > \\"[After the Ostrogoths led by their king Valamir, and his brothers Theodemir > and Vidimir received Pannonia] Now it happened that the sons of Attila, > regarding the Goths as deserters from their rule, came against them as > though they were seeking fugitive slaves and attacked Valamir alone, when > his brothers knew nothing of it. He sustained their attack, though he had > but few with him, and after harassing them a long time, so utterly > overwhelmed them that scarcely a portion of the enemy remained. The remnant > turned in flight and sought the parts of Scythia which border on the stream > of the river Danaber, which the Huns call in their own tongue Var. Whereupon > he sent a messenger of good tidings to his brother Theodemir ... on the very > day the messenger arrived ... Theoderic was born [in 454]\\". Priscus recorded that in 465-466, Dengizich and his brother Ernak sent diplomats to Constantinople. They wanted a peace treaty, and a market place on Danube according to the ancient customs between Romans and Huns, but were rejected. Then Dengizich on his own moved to the bank of the Istros (lower Danube) and threatened to break into Thrace unless he was granted lands and subsidies. He rejected negotiations with Anagast (who defended the Danube in Thrace), and sent diplomats directly to the emperor Leo I. However, Leo I replied that \\"he was ready to do everything if they came to him and offered him obedience. He took pleasure, he said, in nations which came seeking alliances\\". In 467, Dengizich crossed the frozen Danube, and although expected the Huns in the South to join him, large groups of undefined Goths and Scythians moved on their own. Probably after the turning Battle of Nedao, some groups of Goths still remained under Hun authority. Basiliscus, Goths Anagast and Ostryis, and Hun Chelchal were generals who led Roman armies. They managed to besiege the Goths into a valley, and the Scythians \\"oppresed by hunger and lack of necessities sent an embassy to the Romans that if they were to surrender and be allotted lands, they would obey the Romans in whatever they wanted\\". Report continues: Anagast sent a large group of bucellari against the barbarians, but the war dragged on for two years. Jordanes recounts events in c. 468: > \\"Now after firm peace was established between Goths and Romans, the Goths > found that what they received from the emperor was not sufficient for them. > Furthermore, they were eager to display their wonted valor, and so began to > plunder the neighboring peoples around them, first attacking the Sadagis, > who held the interior of Pannonia. When Dintzic, king of the Huns, a son of > Attila, learned this, he gathered to him the few who still seemed to have > remained under his sway, namely, the Ultzinzures, the Angisciri, the > Bittugures and the Bardores.

Marcellinus Comes shortly recorded \\"The head of Dinzic, son of Attila, king of the Huns, was brought to Constantinople\\". The Chronicon Paschale recounts \\"Dinzirichus, Attila's son, was killed by Anagastes, general in Thrace. His head was brought to Constantinople, carried in procession through the Middle Street, and fixed on a pole at the Wooden Circus. The whole city turned out to look at it\\".

Lamb 1996. Pitcher-Plants of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. is a species of tropical pitcher plant. It has a very wide distribution covering Borneo, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, and Singapore. Nepenthes rafflesiana is extremely variable, with numerous forms and varieties described. In Borneo alone, there are at least three distinct varieties. The giant form of this species produces enormous pitchers rivalling those of N. rajah in size. Distribution and habitat Typical habitat of N. rafflesiana. Nepenthes rafflesiana is a widespread lowland species. It is common in Borneo and parts of the Riau Archipelago, but has a restricted distribution in both Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. It is only widespread in the southeastern region of the Malay Peninsula, particularly in the state of Johor, where it is relatively abundant. Nepenthes rafflesiana has only been recorded from the west coast of Sumatra, between Indrapura and Barus.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia.

In: Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. pp. 299‚Äì307. Nepenthes rafflesiana generally occurs in open, sandy, wet areas. It has been recorded from kerangas forest, secondary formations, margins of peat swamp forest, heath forest, and seaside cliffs. It grows at elevations ranging from sea- level to 1200 m or even 1500 m.Adam, J.H., C.C. Wilcock & M.D. Swaine 1992. Journal of Tropical Forest Science 5(1): 13‚Äì25. Description Detail of the peristome on a lower pitcher. Nepenthes rafflesiana is a scrambling vine. The stem may climb to a height of 15 m and is up to 10 mm thick. Internodes are up to 20 cm long. Tendrils may be over 110 cm long. The lower pitchers of N. rafflesiana are bulbous and possess well-developed fringed wings. These terrestrial traps rarely exceed 20 cm in height, although the giant form of N. rafflesiana is known produce pitchers up to 35 cm long and 15 cm wide. Upper pitchers are funnel-shaped and often bear a distinctive raised section at the front of the peristome. Both types of pitchers have a characteristically elongated peristome neck that may be 3 cm or more in length. Pitcher colouration varies greatly from dark purple to almost completely white. The typical form of N. rafflesiana is light green throughout with heavy purple blotches on the lower pitchers and cream-coloured aerial pitchers. The inflorescence is a raceme and grows between 16 and 70 cm tall. The red or purple flowers usually occur singly, or sometimes in pairs, on each flower- stalk. Young plants are wholly covered with long, caducous, brown or white hairs. Mature plants often have a sparse indumentum of short, brown hairs, though they may be completely glabrous. Biology Ant drinking nectar from the peristome of a N. rafflesiana pitcher Nepenthes rafflesiana is found in tropical lowlands. It produces two distinct types of pitchers (heavily modified leaves), which are used to capture and kill insect prey for nutrients. The lower pitchers are generally round, squat and 'winged', while the upper pitchers are more narrow at their base. The species is widely variable and comes in a variety of shapes and colors ‚Äì most contain varying amounts of green, white, and maroon streaks. All Nepenthes are passive carnivores with no moving parts, unlike their distant cousins the Venus flytrap. Nepenthes rafflesiana kills by luring its prey into its pitchers, whose peristomes secrete a sweet-tasting nectar. Once the insect is inside, it quickly finds the walls of the pitcher too slippery to scale and drowns. Digestive enzymes released by the plant into the liquid break down the prey and release soluble nutrients, which are absorbed by the plant through the walls of the pitcher. The carnivorous nature of Nepenthes is supposedly a consequence of living in nutrient-poor soils; since the main method of nutrient absorption in most plants (the root) is insufficient in these soils, the plants have evolved other ways to gain nutrients. As a result, the roots of Nepenthes and most other carnivorous plants are slight and fragile; hence care must be taken when repotting. All Nepenthes are dioecious, meaning that each individual plant has only male or female characteristics. For Nepenthes pitchers being used as daytime roosting sleeping bags by small bats, see Nepenthes hemsleyana#Relationship with bats. Discovery and early history Nepenthes rafflesiana cultivated in England as illustrated in The Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, 1872. Nepenthes rafflesiana was discovered by Dr. William Jack in 1819. In a letter from Singapore published in Curtis's Botanical Magazine, Jack wrote the following account: > It is impossible to conceive anything more beautiful than the approach to > Singapore, through the Archipelago of islands that lie at the extremity of > the Straits of Malacca. Seas of glass wind among innumerable islets, clothed > in all the luxuriance of tropical vegetation and basking in the full > brilliance of a tropical sky... I have just arrived in time to explore the > woods before they yield to the axe, and have made many interesting > discoveries, particularly of two new and splendid species of pitcher-plant > [Nepenthes rafflesiana and Nepenthes ampullaria], far surpassing any yet > known in Europe. I have completed two perfect drawings of them with ample > descriptions. Sir S. Raffles is anxious that we should give publicity to our > researches in one way or other and has planned bringing out something at > Bencoolen. He proposes sending home these pitcher-plants that such splendid > things may appear under all the advantages of elegant execution, by way of > attracting attention to the subject of Sumatran botany. At the time the largest known species in the genus, N. rafflesiana was described in the Gardener's and Farmer's Journal for 1850 as follows: > Whoever has seen this plant in a living state must undoubted be constrained > to consider it as one of the most astonishing productions of the whole > vegetable kingdom. The resemblance that a portion of it bears to our more > familiar domestic utensils leaves a lasting impression on the minds of > spectators that is not easily eradicated; it is the largest and most > magnificent of the genus, far surpassing any hitherto known in Europe. Cultivation Nepenthes rafflesiana is very popular in cultivation; it is a lowland Nepenthes (enjoying hot, humid conditions most of the time, as found in tropical jungle lowlands) but can be grown as an intermediate, with cooler nights and less humidity. It is a comparatively hardy Nepenthes that is commonly recommended as a \\"first plant\\" to new Nepenthes growers. The plant should be grown in shaded conditions, diffuse sunlight, or in a large grow chamber under artificial lights. Watering and misting should be performed frequently, and preferably with distilled water, to avoid mineral build-up that is not only unsightly but that may damage the delicate roots of Nepenthes (and most other carnivorous plants). Standing water is inadvisable. A wet, well-draining potting medium is a necessity. Methods of feeding are varied ‚Äì some growers feed freeze-dried bloodworms or Koi pellets (both available in the fish section of most pet stores); others prefer orchid mixes. No carnivorous plant should ever be fed mammalian meat ‚Äì this will result not only in an unpleasant smell but also the probable rotting of the pitcher and potential death of the plant. The digestive enzymes present have not evolved to handle large prey items, and the rotting material gives opportunistic bacteria and fungi a chance to take hold. Infraspecific taxa Across its expansive range, N. rafflesiana exhibits great variability in both pitcher morphology and colour. The following infraspecific taxa of N. rafflesiana have appeared in the literature. Most of these are not considered valid today, and a number represent different taxa altogether. The elongate plant often referred to informally as N. rafflesiana var. elongata, and described as N. baramensis,Clarke, C., J.A. Moran & C.C. Lee 2011. Nepenthes baramensis (Nepenthaceae) ‚Äì a new species from north-western Borneo. Blumea 56(3): 229‚Äì233. is now known under the name N. hemsleyana.Scharmann, M. & T.U. Grafe 2013.

Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The typical habitat of this form is dense heath forest, especially around vegetation boundaries. The giant form is a much larger plant than the typical form in all respects. The stem may climb to a height of 15 m. Leaf blades are around two and a half times as long as usual. Lower pitchers reach 35 cm in height by 15 cm in width and sometimes exceed 1 litre in volume, making them some of the largest in the genus. They vary widely in pigmentation, from white with red blotches to dark purple. Upper pitchers may be spotted or green throughout. The inflorescence is also massive, reaching over 1 m in length. The individual flowers measure up to 1.5 cm in diameter and have dark red tepals. In addition to its size, the giant form is distinguished by the colour of its developing leaves, which have a bronze sheen. Both this characteristic and the plant's exceptional size are exhibited by cultivated specimens and thus they cannot be due to unusual environmental factors.

Most wild populations of Nepenthes, including N. rafflesiana, are endangered due to habitat destruction and (to a lesser extent) poaching. N. rafflesiana is currently listed as a CITES Appendix II plant, so it does have some international trade restrictions (though not an outright ban). Today, most N. rafflesiana plants on the market are propagated by plant tissue culture or other forms of vegetative propagation. When purchasing any plant, especially those protected by CITES, it is important to ask the vendor about the plant's provenance.

They are often portrayed as antagonists in those novels, enemy to the rivaling Skolian Empire. Eubian Concord is an interstellar civilization consisting of several thousand planets, with an economy based on slavery. Named after its founder Eube Qox, the Concord is governed by an emperor, who acts as an absolute ruler. So far all five emperors have been from the House of Qox, direct descendants of Eube Qox, with Eube being the first emperor, followed by Jaibriol I, Ur, Jaibriol II and Jaibriol III. Population Several thousand Aristos occupy the highest echelon of Eubian society, controlling the government, wealth and the military. They are the only free people in the Concord, all other Eubians are slaves. The two trillion majority of the population are called taskmakers, and have varying degrees of freedom. The lowest echelon of the Eubian Concord comprises a few thousand providers, who are psions enslaved by the Aristos, both for pleasure and for transcendence. Aristos Aristos are the ruling class of Eubian Concord. They are in general extremely wealthy and own entire worlds inclusive the enslaved inhabitants. The most known Aristo noble Houses are the Qox, Muze, Xir, Iquar, Taratus, Kaliga and Raziquon. Because Aristos intermarry quite often, most of the Houses are already closely related to each other. The appearance of Aristos is marked by their characteristic red eyes and black shimmering hair. His or her looks is very important for an Aristo, as it may be useful for gaining influential position. It belongs to good manners to look good, young and well shaped. If an Aristo is old, fat or ugly, it is recommended to visit a body sculptor, who can get people in top form with the help of modern plastic surgery. Aristos form the top-most echelon of Eubian society and comprise three main categories: * Highton ‚Äì control the government and military * Diamond ‚Äì manage commerce and production * Silicate ‚Äì produce the means of pleasure As a race, Aristos are an unfortunate result of the Rhon project. Led by a geneticist named Hezahr Rhon, this project was originally started to produce a psion who would possess strong empathic and telepathic abilities but wouldn't suffer when experiencing the unpleasant emotions of others, like pain or fear. The outcome was however a race of people who not only lack empathic or telepathic abilities, but are also utterly devoid of compassion. Their brains interpret pain of others (especially of psions) as pleasure, which makes them the ultimate sadists. The stronger pain a psion feels, the more pleasure it means for an Aristo. The elevated sense of ecstasy experienced by Aristos when causing pain to psions is called transcendence. This transcendence is considered normal and appropriate among Aristos, who are raised to believe that the pleasure obtained from torturing telepaths is their inherent right. There are however a few exceptions who decided to have their Kyle Afferent Body or KAB (the microscopic organ in their brain that is responsible for their need for transcendence) removed. Those must keep their decision secret, as knowledge of this would make them to outcasts in the Aristo society. Aristos see themselves as kind, good-hearted, moral, noble and merciful. They take care of their slaves, who in their opinion would not survive a single minute without the guidance of their masters. Their psionic pleasure slaves are supposed to feel \\"honored\\" by being allowed to help their owners reaching transcendence. From an Aristo point of view every non-Aristo is less than a human, thus incapable of independent thinking and actions and should be subject to Aristos. That inhabitants of the Skolian Empire and the Allied worlds survive without having an owner is an abomination according to Aristo standards. =Half-breeds= Besides their legitimate offspring, many Aristos (both men and women) also have children with their providers. Such children do not manifest the empathic and telepathic abilities of their psion parent, as the necessary genes must come from both parents. They however mostly inherit from their Aristo parent the defective KAB resulting in the need for transcendence. Prevalence of Aristo genes decreases with every next generation of part-Aristos mixing with non-Aristos. Thus a child or grandchild of a half-Aristo may already have a \\"normal\\" mind. All children from an Aristo‚Äìprovider union are considered slaves, rated as taskmakers. Many Aristos take pride in giving their taskmaker offspring good education, wealth and profitable and influential jobs. Rare attempts to pass off such child as a member of an Aristo caste are major crimes according to Eubian law. It is an Aristo tradition to give their taskmaker children names that reflect their Aristo genitor ‚Äì so Xirson is a son of an Aristo called Xir, Qoxdaughter is daughter of Qox, etc. Taskmakers In general, taskmakers are all Eubian slaves who are not psions. In fact, the population of Eubian Concord consists mainly of taskmakers, who complete all necessary tasks in the society. Every taskmaker has an occupation to which he/she has been trained for. The many various jobs taskmakers can execute include all possible trades, jobs of technicians, engineers, agriculturists, medical staff including specialized doctors, military personnel and officers etc. Many taskmakers, especially those who occupy influential jobs in state administration or army, are of mixed Aristo-provider blood. In general, the more significant Aristo ancestry a taskmaker has, the more prestigious position is he/she likely to gain. High status taskmakers may actually become factory directors, starship captains or administrators of entire planets, are allowed to keep property, even have slaves on their own. Lots of taskmakers live ordinary, comfortable lives and have a higher standard of living than their counterparts in the Skolian Empire. Nevertheless, they remain slaves and their entire life could be forfeit at the decision of an Aristo. Razers are taskmakers who act as bodyguards for the highest Aristo nobility and receive extensive bioenhancements including cybernetic implants, making them the Eubian counterparts of the Skolian Jagernauts. Razers are the only slaves who are not supposed to kneel in front of an Aristo because this may influence their ability to protect their owner. Providers Providers are Eubian sex slaves, psions who live solely for one purpose ‚Äì to provide empathic input for their Aristo masters with their suffering during torture, so that the Aristo may reach the elevated state of transcendence. As such, providers are on the lowest echelon of Eubian society. Sexual relationships with providers are not considered infidelity in Eubian culture because they are just slaves. In fact, an Aristo husband might give a provider to his wife as a present, and a host might entertain his guests by offering them his providers. Providers are rare and very expensive, especially the ones with strongest empathic abilities. Their main task is to look extremely good, suffer without complaining and please their master in any possible way. To achieve perfection in their duties, providers are raised in special pavilions where they get \\"proper\\" education. Different lines of providers are bred for their specific physical and mental attributes like beauty or heightened sensual response. An early attempt to create a line of extremely strong empathic providers lead unintentionally to the rise of the Skolian ruling family, the Ruby Dynasty. Breeding psions is however an insufficient source for providers and other means are needed to satisfy the still increasing demands of Eubian market. As a solution, Eubian pirate ships make illegal raids on Skolian and Allied ships, kidnapping psions with high KAB Rating and selling them into slavery. History Like Skolians, the Eubians also trace back their roots to the ancient Ruby Empire, ruled by psionic warrior queens. Yet unlike Skolians, who refer to themselves as to the successors of the Ruby Empire, Eubians choose their own way, founding a civilization based on slavery, where psions are considered inferior. Military The military of Eubian Concord is comprised in Eubian Space Command (ESComm). Duties of commanding ESComm are shared by two influential Highton Aristo top officers, so-called Joint Commanders, who are appointed directly by the emperor. ESComm has a powerful fleet, which easily outnumbers the fleets of both Skolians and Allieds. The fleet consists of various types of warships, from small Solo and Stinger fighters and to huge warrior ships or floating cities. During the Radiance War, ESComm has gathered 2,000,000 ships to conquer a main Skolian base, the Onyx Platform. ESComm has many military bases scattered across the whole Concord, particularly in the strategic Platinum sector. Another highly defended ESComm post is Sphinx Sector Rim Base (SSRB), which is the current residence of the Third Lock, captured by ESComm during the Radiance War. The best defended place in Eubian Concord is the central world Eube's Glory. Although the Eubian army is larger and has more resources, attempts to conquer enemy Skolian Empire always failed due to the Skolian psiberweb, which enables Skolians virtual instantaneous communication, giving them a big advantage. Clumsy attempts have been made by Providers working under General Barthol Iquar to access and alter Kyle space with limited success. Law In Eubian Concord slavery is considered legal and Aristos are allowed to decide about life and death of their slaves. Despite the fact that it is officially forbidden to gain new slaves with illegal raids in Allied and Skolian territory, an unwritten law says that it is allowed to obtain a slave by any possible means. Actually, an Aristo who breaks laws is not likely to receive punishment, unless he/she falls into disfavour of the emperor. Crimes of slaves are not handled with such benevolence. Punishment for any slave who commits a crime or does not obey orders can be death or torture, eventually brain-washing. Longing for freedom is not allowed for slaves. Occasional taskmaker uprisings are suppressed very strictly, their Aristo owners even don't recoil from wiping out the entire population of a rebelling planet. The only chance for a slave to live in freedom is therefore an escape in Skolian or Allied territory. Language Common language for inhabitants of the many thousand different planets, which are part of Eubian Concord is called Eubic. Language of the ruling Aristo caste is Highton. In Highton speech, direct language is considered rude, and all Highton speakers use subtle and multi-layered language. Direct speech is only allowed in a conversation of family members or if a Highton speaks with a member of the lower classes (as slaves are not supposed to understand the exalted Highton language).  Eube's Glory  Eube's Glory, often called just Glory, is the Eubian homeworld, seat of the government. The planet was designed according to the wishes of Eube Qox, after whom it was named. Glory has a radius three times Earth's and gravity of 92% in comparison to Earth. There are fourteen moons in the star system of Glory, most of which have no names, only numbers. They get their names after wives of Eubian emperors, that's why most of them are unnamed yet (there haven't been so many emperors and empresses). For the present, only five moons with names exist ‚Äì Mirella, Zara, Viquara, Prism and Tarquine.

One example is the industrial production of cortisone, which one step is the bioconversion of progesterone to 11-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone by Rhizopus nigricans. Another example is the bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol, which is part of scientific research for many decades. Another example of bioconversion is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or energy sources by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms, some detritivores or enzymes. In the USA, the Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&D; for the Department of Energy's (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing, especially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical engineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is investigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial enzymes in bioenergy research. New cellulosic ethanol conversion processes have enabled the variety and volume of feedstock that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now includes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-fluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, municipal solid waste (MSW), sludge, sewage, etc. Three different processes for bioconversion 1 - Enzymatic hydrolysis - a single source of feedstock, switchgrass for example, is mixed with strong enzymes which convert a portion of cellulosic material into sugars which can then be fermented into ethanol. Genencor and Novozymes are two companies that have received United States government Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulase, a key enzyme in the production cellulosic ethanol by this process. 2 - Synthesis gas fermentation - a blend of feedstock, not exceeding 30% water, is gasified in a closed environment into a syngas containing mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The cooled syngas is then converted into usable products through exposure to bacteria or other catalysts. BRI Energy, LLC is a company whose pilot plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas is currently using synthesis gas fermentation to convert a variety of waste into ethanol. After gasification, anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium ljungdahlii) are used to convert the syngas (CO, CO2, and H2) into ethanol. The heat generated by gasification is also used to co- generate excess electricity. 3 - C.O.R.S. and Grub Composting are sustainable technologies that employ organisms that feed on organic matter to reduce and convert organic waste in to high quality feedstuff and oil rich material for the biodiesel industry. Organizations pioneering this novel approach to waste management are EAWAG, ESR International, Prota Culture and BIOCONVERSION that created the e-CORS¬Æ system to meet large scale organic waste management needs and environmental sustainability in both urban and livestock farming reality. This type of engineered system introduces a substantial innovation represented by the automatic modulation of the treatment, able to adapt conditions of the system to the biology of the scavenger used, improving their performances and the power of this technology.

The plot of the book unfolds over several generations of characters and revolves around political intrigues, but also contains subplots regarding physics, bio-enhancements, virtual computer networks, romance, mathematics, and military conflict as it is affected by supraluminal space travel. Skolian Empire The Skolian Empire, or Skolian Imperialate, is one of the major empires in the science fiction novel series called the Saga of the Skolian Empire by Catherine Asaro. The stories of Asaro mostly revolve around the Skolian Empire. She also has written several novellas and novelettes on the world of the Skolian Empire. Political situation Skolians are in a permanent near-war state with their enemy, the Eubians, who rule a much bigger star-spanning empire called the Eubian Concord. Eubians (often also referred to as Traders, due to their flourishing slave trade) have stronger military and dispose of greater resources. Skolians, though weaker, balance this out by usage of their faster-than-light interstellar communication network called psiberweb, which gives them an important advantage and is the only obstacle that prevents the Eubians from conquering Skolia. Another player on the interstellar stage are the Allieds, the smallest of the three empires, centered on Earth. They act in a strictly neutral way to both Eubians and Skolians and support the solution of their neighbour's conflicts by political, rather than military means. Society Today's Skolian Empire is an egalitarian society, but the original Ruby Empire was a matriarchy and remnants of this still remain in Skolian culture. Although it is now not uncommon for men to hold an influential position, many important ranks in Skolian politics and military are still occupied by women. Many people, especially members of the noble houses, still consider men as the \\"weaker gender\\". Government The Skolian Imperialate is ruled partly by the Assembly, an elected parliament; and by the Ruby Dynasty, a hereditary monarchy. According to traditional Skolian political theory the ruling body is absolute, therefore the Assembly is Sovereign. All powers of the Imperator and the Pharaoh are theoretically derived from the Assembly, including their right to vote within the Assembly. In actuality the Pharaoh, and also the Imperator, have power because they are necessary to the continued existence of the Imperialate. In the case of the Pharaoh, traditional loyalty to the Ruby Dynasty queen also plays an important role. This makes the Assembly's power far from absolute. Assembly The Assembly consists of thousands of delegates, who represent the many worlds of the Imperialate. The number of votes held by delegates depends on the size of the population of the planet that elected them and also on their status within the Assembly. The largest block of votes belongs to the First Councilor, who is leader of the Assembly. The next largest blocks are held by Councilors of the Inner Circle and by Skolian Imperator and Ruby Pharaoh. All Skolian noble houses have hereditary seats in the Assembly but only the Ruby Dynasty and the House of Majda have blocs of votes with considerable influence. There are five main political parties within the Assembly: * the Royalists want royalty to rule the empire, instead of the elected parliament * the Traditionalists would prefer to return to matriarchy and seclude men into harems * the Progressives promote modernization and major changes in society * the Technologists urge technological improvements * the Moderates are the largest and most influential group, trying to balance out the other four The Inner Circle consists of elected Councilors representing different ministries of the Skolian government: Industry, Life, Finance, Intelligence, Judiciary, Stars, Planetary Development, Domestic Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Protocol and Nature. The Foreign Affairs Councillor is Roca Skolia. Besides the Assembly, two important titles in Skolian government are held by members of the Ruby Dynasty. Ruby Pharaoh Ruby Pharaoh is the hereditary title of a reigning monarch. It dates back to the ancient Ruby Empire that was ruled by powerful warrior queens. When the modern Skolian Empire was founded, the title of Ruby Pharaoh was resurrected, yet this time the power of a Pharaoh is not absolute any more. An elected Assembly governs, with the Pharaoh being mainly the titular head of the empire, though she holds an important bloc of votes in the Assembly. The role of the Pharaoh is also associated with the Triad title of Assembly Key, though both positions don't have to be necessarily joined together. There have been only two Skolian Pharaohs so far ‚Äì Lahaylia Selei, the founder of the Imperialate and her daughter Dyhianna, who is the current Pharaoh. The heirs to the throne are Dyhiannas sons, first Taquinil, then Althor, with her younger sister Roca being next in line. Imperator The title of Imperator is associated with army, the Imperator being the supreme commander of all Skolian military forces. This title is also hereditary but the Imperator can choose a successor from among several suitable candidates. If a member of the Ruby Dynasty cannot assume this title for some reason, then the person who is currently next in command of the military becomes Imperator. To do the job well, to its full extent, the Imperator also has to be the Military Key in the Triad, as the commander must be able to co-ordinate the military forces with an amount of speed only allowed by using the psiberweb. The Skolian Imperators so far have been Jarac Skolia, Kurj Skolia, Sauscony Valdoria Skolia, General Naaj Majda and Kelric Valdoria Skolia who presently holds the title. History The Skolian Empire traces its roots to six thousand years ago, when an unknown race took humans from Earth and resettled them on a planet called Raylicon. Then the unknown race disappeared, leaving only parts of their technology behind. The humans on Raylicon used this technology to develop space travel. They founded the Ruby Empire and colonized hundreds of planets. But the empire collapsed, and many worlds were left isolated for thousands of years. Gradually, the empire was rebuilt, and approximately 400 years ago, the Raylicans re-developed space travel. The Raylicans also rediscovered the Locks, devices that have allowed advanced telepaths to establish the interstellar network called the Kyle Web or psiberweb, which can be used by others. Thus, the Rhon project was developed to develop genetically the necessary neurochemistry to power the Locks. The unintended result of the Rhon project, however, was the creation of Aristos, a race of anti-empaths, whose brains interpret pain of others (especially of psions) as pleasure, which turned them into sadists. This result led to the birth of two competing interstellar empires ‚Äì Eubian Concord (founded by Aristos) and Skolian Empire ‚Äì founded by Lahaylia Selei, progenitor of the modern Ruby Dynasty, a family of Rhon telepaths who currently co-rule the Skolian Imperialate and power and maintain the Kyle Web. Important Skolian worlds * Parthonia ‚Äì seat of the Skolian government where Assembly meetings take place. * Metropoli ‚Äì most heavily populated planet in the Imperialate. * Diesha ‚Äì seat of the Jagernaut military academy and of ISC. * Lyshriol ‚Äì homeworld of the Valdoria branch of the Ruby Dynasty. * Orbiter ‚Äì space habitat, home of the Ruby Pharaoh and a place where one of the three Locks is located. * Onyx platform ‚Äì a complex of space stations designed to defend the Third Lock. Onyx was destroyed during the Radiance War and the Lock was captured by Traders. * Raylicon ‚Äì birthplace of the Ruby Empire, location of the First Lock. Military The collection of Skolian armed forces is called Imperial Space Command, or ISC. The commander-in-chief of all ISC forces is the Imperator of Skolia. The ISC has four divisions: * J-Force ‚Äì analogous to air force, consists of Jag fighters and their Jagernaut pilots * Advance Services Corps ‚Äì scouts planets * Pharaoh's Army ‚Äì the oldest branch with a 5000-year history traced back to the beginning of the Ruby Empire, concentrates mainly on planetary war conflicts * Imperial Fleet ‚Äì originated in the navy on Raylicon, now it dominates the space division of ISC The main centers of ISC are the space habitat Orbiter with its War Room, Triad Chair and Lock, the Onyx Platform protecting the Third Lock and the planet Diesha, which serves as the ISC headquarters and seat of the Dieshan Military Academy. Science Asaro is known as a hard science fiction writer for the scientific depth of her work. The amount of science varies from book to book, with novels such as Primary Inversion, The Radiant Seas, and Spherical Harmonic on the most scientifically dense end of the spectrum, including elements such as equations and diagrams of quantum mechanical wave functions and Klein bottles. Stanley Schmidt, the long time editor of Analog magazine, wrote that Primary Inversion is \\"an impressive first novel; not just a good story, but the kind of speculation we too seldom see ‚Äì really new science that just might be possible.\\" Asaro is noted as one of the few female science fiction writers who also has a doctorate in hard science, in Asaro's case a PhD from Harvard in theoretical Chemical Physics. The novel Spherical Harmonic involves an imagined universe based on the Hilbert space described by the spherical harmonic eigenfunctions that solve the Laplace Equation, and some prose in the book is written in the shape of the sinusoidal waves found in the spherical harmonics. Her novel The Quantum Rose is an allegory to quantum scattering theory and is dedicated to her doctoral advisors and mentors in the subject, Alex Dalgarno, Kate Kirby, and Eric J. Heller.Thehachiko.com The novella \\"Aurora in Four Voices\\" includes topics ranging from Fourier series to integration problems in calculus. In essays in the back of some of her novels, Asaro explains the mathematical and physics basis of the ideas used in the books, in particular Spherical Harmonic, The Quantum Rose, and The Moon's Shadow. In the anthology Aurora in Four Voices (which includes the novella of the same name), Asaro describes the mathematical basis of several stories in the anthology, including the use of Fourier transforms, Riemann sheets, and complex numbers in \\"The SpaceTime Pool.\\" Inversion The method of space travel used in the Skolian Empire books comes from a paper Asaro wrote on complex variables and special relativity that appeared in the American Journal of Physics.Am. J. Phys, 64 (4), April 1996, 421 The form of space travel is called \\"inversion\\" because the equations of relativistic physics predict that if ships could travel in a supraluminal universe, the constellations as we know them would appear inverted in position. In the abstract for her paper, \\"Complex Speeds and Special Relativity,\\" Asaro writes \\"The quest to find faster‚Äêthan‚Äêlight particles has intrigued physicists for decades, though it has yet to turn up any real candidates. Even if a superluminal universe does exist, we have no way to reach it given that we must go through the speed of light, which to the best of our knowledge is impossible. In this paper, I show that by making speed complex, we can go around the speed of light in a manner analogous to the way a car faced with an infinitely tall road block might leave the road to go around that barrier. The treatment is a mathematical device; no known physical interpretation exists for the imaginary part of a complex speed. However, it can provide an entertaining problem in special relativity, one that may encourage students to think about the connections between equations and the physical universe.\\"Abstract, Complex Speeds and Relativity, AAPT sciatations Evolving Intelligence Evolving Intelligence, also known as EI, is the term given to sophisticated computer systems, similar to what is commonly known as Artificial Intelligence, or AI, but with more capabilities, such as complex learning algorithm and personality routines. EIs are used for example in starships or as administrators of computer systems in a house or complex of buildings. Quasis In interstellar travel, Skolians often make use of quasis, which is a form of quantum-shielding that freezes the quantum state of all particles on a spacecraft. Ships in both the Skolian Empire and the Eubians are equipped with devices, controlled by EIs that shift a ship into \\"quasis\\" to avoid damage to the ship from weapons fire or from high-G maneuvers. The quasis prevents change in the quantum state of any particle, temporarily rendering the ship invulnerable. While in quasis, the quantum state of all the occupants of the ship also freezes causing the crew to experiences the quasis as a disjointed segment of time. Each weapon strike against a ship in quasis weakens its quasis field. The novels describe an unspecified number of weapon hits (typically suggesting two to four) that will collapse a quasis field and re-animate the crew in the midst of a massive explosion. A collapse of a quasis field results in a rupture of the Klein bottles holding the anti-matter fuel used to power the ship, resulting in matter-antimatter explosions. Health care Age delaying treatments Due to advanced nanotechnology, microscopic nanomeds can be put into peoples bodies to manage cell repair and delay aging. This enables the extension of a human lifespan to several centuries. People also keep a young appearance, as they stop visibly aging at the age of 30 ‚Äì 40. It is important to start the treatments as early in life as possible. People who received those treatments in early childhood or before birth (passed on from mother to child during pregnancy) achieve the best results. The older a person is when receiving anti-aging treatments for the first time, the larger the possibility that they won't work that well. Bio-enhancements In Skolian Empire, many people, most often in the military or administration, carry bio-implants. Most common are nodes in brain which are used mainly as extended memory to store useful data. Many people have also psiphon sockets in their spine, wrists and ankles, that enable them to lock into the psiberweb. People who suffer severe injuries and lose their limbs or eyes can get prosthetic ones. Languages The Skolian Imperialate consists of many worlds with hundreds or thousands of different languages. The language that was chosen as a common tongue is called Skolian Flag. People from the Ruby Dynasty and other noble houses speak a nearly extinct language called Iotic.  Political situation  The Ruby Dynasty, the ancient rulers of the Skolian Empire, while possessing empathic and telepathic abilities enhanced by \\"pico\\" and \\"nano\\" technology, constitute a monarchy plagued by internal struggle and conflict with the elected Assembly. The Eubian Traders, on the other hand, while larger in number and more successful economically, constitute a society built entirely of a slave hierarchy run by Aristos, who have been genetically engineered and have no capability for compassion, but rather experience pleasure in the form of \\"transcendence\\" through the projected suffering of powerful psions that have been kidnapped from the Skolian Imperialate. A third but much smaller group, the Allieds, are an extension of a present-day Earth civilization who enter space travel only to find all worlds are already inhabited and thriving under either the Skolian or Eubian Empire. Their role in the series is that of a neutral party, interested only in the cessation of hostilities.  Historical background  Around 6,000 years ago an unknown race moved a group of Mayan humans from Earth to the distant planet Raylicon. Then the kidnappers disappeared, leaving their victims on their own. The Raylicans developed star travel using the remains of three starships left behind by the aliens on their new homeworld. They reverse engineered the technology, allowing them to achieve spaceflight and colonize hundreds of planets. They also discovered the Locks, an ancient and sentient alien technology that allowed them to create the psiberweb, an interstellar network existing outside of normal space and time that transmits messages instantaneously. Their empire was called the Ruby Empire. The Ruby Empire was a matriarchy ruled by powerful females who held the title of Ruby Pharaoh. The Pharaohs wielded enormous power, leading armies to wars and treating their husbands like property. Succession went strictly through the female line, men being seen as incapable of such responsibilities. A man could only become a Pharaoh under special circumstances, such as his when his royal mother had no daughters. However, their shallow understanding of space-faring technology, and possibly their corruption, led to the empire's collapse after only a few centuries. This isolated the hundreds of planets in their empire from each other for thousands of years. Eventually, about 400 years ago, Raylicans re-achieved space flight, this time fully understanding the technology, and started to rebuild their empire. Because of this theme, Asaro's Skolian Empire novels have been categorized in the lost world genre.  Ruby Dynasty  By the time the Raylicans started rebuilding their empire, the psions which had a strong enough KAB Rating to power the psiberweb had been all but lost. As a result, the Rhon project was created to genetically engineer the traits necessary to create the psiberweb. The ruling family of today's Skolian Empire is called the Ruby Dynasty, as Lahaylia Selei, the progenitor of the modern Ruby family, was cloned from the genetic material of one of the long dead warrior queens of the Ruby Empire. The descendants of the Ruby Dynasty are all Rhon psions. They can read moods, and even particular thoughts. They were created in a genetic engineering experiment to help power the Locks. Ruby Dynasty members differ physically from the members of other noble Houses, who are mostly dark-haired and dark-eyed, also with darker skin. This is because some ancestors of the Ruby Dynasty came from ancient colonies of the Ruby Empire, where people genetically engineered themselves to better adapt to their surroundings. The first Skolian Imperator Jarac was extremely tall (over 7 feet) with metallic skin, eyes and hair. Some of his descendants inherited these traits, particularly his daughter Roca and grandsons Kurj, Althor and Kelric. Ruby family members who look similar to the first Pharaoh Lahaylia, such as Dyhianna, Sauscony or Taquinil, are on the other hand smaller than average and slim with black hair. Eldrinson Valdoria, a native Lyshrioli, had violet eyes, fair skin and burgundy hair, which is also true for several of his children, especially Eldrin and Del-Kurj. Ruby Dynasty members tend to be good-looking because their progenitors were bred as pleasure slaves before they rebelled and established the Skolian Imperialate. Once a member of the Ruby Dynasty makes contact with a Lock, they become part of the Triad (formerly a Dyad). A member of the Triad is called a Key. Three types of Keys exist: Assembly Key, Military Key and Web Key. Each Key has to have a unique personality different from the other two as much as possible because if the neurological processes are two similar, they cannot coexist in the Triad. So far the title of Pharaoh was always associated with the Assembly Key, while the title Imperator was associated with the Military Key.  Jagernauts  Jagernauts are fictional soldiers in the Saga of the Skolian Empire by Catherine Asaro. They are members of the J-Force, which is an ISC elite fighting division composed of independent fighter pilots who engage in small squadron combat with the Eubians. Jagernauts are psions with high Kyle Ratings, generally full empaths or even telepaths, with even a few Rhon serving as well. Their telepathic or empathic abilities mean that they function best when there is no crew (and their corresponding thoughts) to interfere with a Jagernaut's concentration. As such, they generally engage in battle in small squadrons, bound to their single-pilot craft called \\"Jags\\" in a near symbiosis of human and machine. A Jagernaut has \\"psiphon\\" sockets which allow them to interface their body directly with spacecraft. Their mind links directly to the ship's EI, and together they control all aspects of the ship. A Jagernaut is enhanced with biomechanics. Bioplastics and other materials enhance their muscles and bones significantly. Although still requiring food, a Jagernaut has internal systems powered by a microfusion reactor. Complete with the latest in small-scale technology, Jagernauts have numerous nanomeds and nano/pico devices in their bodies that are responsible for a number of functions, including promoting injury recovery, preventing the ingestion of poison, augmenting skills, delaying aging, and more. Jagernauts are renowned for their large size and efficiency in battle.  Jagernaut ranks  Jagernauts ranks from highest to lowest # Primary (equivalent to Admiral) # Secondary (equivalent to Colonel) # Tertiary (equivalent to Major) # Quaternary (equivalent to Second Lieutenant) The main training academy for Jagernauts is the Dieshan Military Academy (DMA). The cadet ranks from lowest to highest are: Apprentice, Journeyman, Junior, and Senior.  Mental problems  A Jagernaut exists on the razor's edge of sanity needing to balance empathy with efficient battle reflexes. Jagernaut's must be psions to make the necessary neural links with the Evolving Intelligences on their star fighters, but that also means they experience what happens during war more intensely than most soldiers. To maintain self-control every Jagernaut is trained to adhere to a strict moral code of honor and personal decency. Not all succeed in maintaining a balance between humanity and efficiency, giving J-Force the highest alcoholism and suicide rates within the forces of the Skolian Imperialate. Some Jagernauts manage to survive by suppressing their more human side, becoming either cold and machine-like (Kurj), or living lives of quiet emotional desperation and loneliness (Sauscony). Help is usually available to emotionally damaged Jagernauts in the form of military psychiatric therapists, known as \\"heartbenders\\".  Main characters of the Ruby Dynasty = Roca Skolia  Roca Skolia, also known as Roca, is the Foreign Affairs Councillor of the Skolian Imperialate. Daughter of the late Lahaylia Selei, founder of the Imperialate and her husband, former Imperator Jarac Skolia, she is also a Rhon psion. She is also younger sister of the recent Skolian Pharaoh Dyhianna Selei and as such next in line for position of Ruby Pharaoh and of Assembly Key in the Triad between the disappearance of Taquinil Selei and the birth of Althor Izam-na Selei. Since her personality is most like that of her late father and her late son Kurj, she is also considered an emergency backup choice for the position of Military Key in case something should ever happen to her youngest son, Kelric Valdoria, the current Imperator. Roca was formerly a renowned dancer known under the name Cya Liessa, and possesses a remarkably aesthetic appeal. With her tall and well- shaped figure, angelic face, golden skin and eyes and long curly golden, copper and platinum hair, all inherited from her father Jarac, she looks like a sun goddess and most men are stunned by her appearance. Nobody would guess her to be more than 20 years old, yet she is already over 100. She is very kind and loves her family above everything, but she can be also very resolute and strong-willed. She is a brilliant politician who strongly participates in Skolian politics and won the position of the Foreign Affairs Councilor by election, not because of her royal title. Roca was married three times. Her first marriage to the explorer Tokaba Ryestar was arranged by her parents with reference to the necessity to produce Rhon offspring (which is only possible with a suitable partner). Sadly, it ended after only a few years with her husband's untimely death. Roca had a son named Kurj from this marriage, who was born as a product of in-vitro fertilization. Roca's second marriage with Darr Hammerjackson was a disaster. He abused both her and her son for several years, before they finally divorced. The third and final marriage of Roca Skolia was to the much younger Eldrinson Althor Valdoria from a provincial planet called Lyshriol. Eldrinson was a perfect match to Roca - the first Rhon born in Skolian Empire who wasn't a member of the ruling family of Skolia. Roca and Eldrinson have 10 children. The Skolian Imperialate novels in which Roca is a major character are: * Skyfall - tells the story how Roca met her third husband Eldrinson.  Eldrinson Althor Valdoria  Eldrinson Althor Valdoria, also known as Eldri, was originally an illiterate farmer from the backward planet Lyshriol. He had the title of the Dalvador Bard, which made him sort of ruler in the Dalvador province. He was a brave, strong-willed and kind man who cared deeply for his people, and also a Rhon psion. Even at a young age he was a respected leader, loved by his people and famous for his spectacular singing voice which he used to perform one of his duties ‚Äì record history of his people in ballads. he has violet eyes, fair skin and burgundy hair, and only four fingers on each hand. For a long time Eldrinson had seen himself as lacking. Mainly because of his epilepsy, which bothered him since childhood and nearly cost him his life when he became adult, as the seizures got worse and worse. Skolian doctors couldn't heal him completely but advanced medicine enabled him to live a nearly normal life. The meeting with his wife's people also showed Eldrinson how backward and uneducated he and his fellows are in comparison with the majority of people in the Skolian Empire. The Lyshrioli, including himself, were genetically incapable of written language which made it impossible for them to learn how to read and write. Technical wonders Roca brought into Eldrinson's life both astounded and terrified him and he tried to avoid them when possible. He had seven sons and three daughters with Roca and though he loved them all deeply, it was hard for him to understand those of his children who chose to live a modern life off-world, even joining the military. Problems with his children forced Eldrinson to re- think many opinions he took for granted (such as women cannot be warriors). Despite his position as Roca's consort, most members of the imperial court looked at Eldrinson as someone far beneath them. This changed during a crisis, when Eldrinson saved the Skolian Empire by joining the Triad and becoming the Web Key. Eldrinson then served many decades as a Key to the psiberweb and became very popular among the common Skolians. Despite the life extending treatments, which didn't work for him as well as for most people, Eldrinson died of old age on his homeworld when he was 90, shortly after the end of Radiance War and reunion with his long lost son Kelric.  Sauscony Lahaylia Valdoria Skolia  Sauscony Lahaylia Valdoria Skolia, also called Soz or Soshoni, is a member of the Ruby Dynasty ruling the Skolian Empire, and as such has the empathic and telepathic abilities of a Rhon psion. She ranks Jagernaut Primary in the ISC, and later in the series becomes Imperator. Soz was born on the rustic planet Lyshriol as the sixth of ten children of the local Bard Eldrinson Valdoria and his wife Roca Skolia, a Ruby Dynasty heir. Since early childhood she showed huge interest in modern technology of her mother's people, especially that connected to military. At the age of 16 she took preliminary entrance exams for the Dieshan Military Academy to fulfill her dream and become a Jagernaut. After achieving record high scores (perfect in fact) she was granted immediate acceptance into the academy ‚Äì much to the displeasure of her father, who feared losing his children to war and couldn‚Äôt understand why a she wanted to become a warrior when he had thought her rural life home could offer her a gentler life close to her family. Soz excelled in all subjects, military strategy and engineering being just a few of them. She graduated from the DMA in three years with an honors record despite earning a record number demerits. Her later career also proceeded quickly, and she gained the rank of a Primary at a relatively early age. She became the leader of Blackstar Squadron and her half-brother Kurj Skolia, the Imperator of Skolia named her as one of his three possible imperial heirs (the other two being her brothers Althor and Kelric). She had to deal with the difficulties of her job, because her empath's mind experienced the deaths of enemies she killed. A capture during an undercover mission, when she was tortured and raped by an Aristo, also scarred her deeply. Despite being a psion, she often has problems expressing her feelings. She is not good with words and prefers action to talking. Though hard-edged, Soz has also a sensitive side, which she doesn't show very often, because she considers it a weakness. As described by James Schellenberg in his review at Challenging Destiny, Soz is \\"a strong, dynamic character, one that people of either gender can easily identify with. However, Sauscony is not a one-note monolith of fortitude and brawn -- she is articulate, funny, and empathic to boot. But most of all, Sauscony is a character with a past, a past filled with needs, betrayals, tragedies, friends, and triumphs.\\" Soz's first marriage to Jato Stormson ended in divorce after Soz got pregnant but lost the baby after being injured during a space battle. Her second husband, Hypron Luminar, died of an uncurable illness after only a few months of marriage. Soz met her third husband Jaibriol Qox II on the Allied planet Delos. Like Soz, Jaibriol was a Rhon psion, but he was also a member of the Aristo Highton caste and heir to the enemy of Skolians, the Eubian Concord. In order to come together they first had to overcome many difficulties and finally decided to fake their own deaths in order to go into exile on an isolated planet within Allied (Earth) space, which they named Prism. They lived there a happy life there for 16 years and raised four children. When Kurj died and Jaibriol was kidnapped by Eubians, Soz returned home to become the new Imperator of the Skolian Imperialate. To rescue her husband and prevent the Eubians from conquering Skolia, she sent a fleet to Eube‚Äôs homeworld, Glory, extending a conflict that became known as the Radiance War. At the end of the war, she and Jaibriol faked their deaths again to go back into exile and start a stable colony on Prism together with their children, Soz‚Äôs brother Althor and a group of Jagernaut volunteers. However, Soz's eldest son Jai separated from his family before his parents returned to Earth to claim their children. Grieving for his parents deaths and the devastation in the open space that was caused by war and by the Aristos, he later became the Emperor of Eube as Jaibriol III. The Skolian Imperialate novels in which Soz is a major character are: * Primary Inversion covering her early life and later meeting with Jaibriol Qox II; * The short story \\"Aurora in Four Voices\\" where she meets and rescues Jato Stormson; * The Radiant Seas which covers her escape with Jaibriol, life with children, return to Skolia, and second escape; * The novelette \\"The Pyre of New Day\\" which tells the story of Hypron Luminar and how he meets her.  Kurj Skolia  Kurj Skolia, also known as Kurj, was an ambitious Jagernaut Primary, and later became Imperator Skolia. Kurj was the son of Roca Skolia and had a troubled past involving his mother and various father figures. He and his mother were abused for many years by Roca's second husband Darr - Kurj's stepfather, who saw the pubescent boy as a rival. As he grew older, Kurj's subconscious attraction to and jealousy for his mother resulted in disaster when he found that his biological father was also his mother's father Jarac, which was a result of in vitro fertilization. He looks like his biologic father Jarac, and is tall with golden skin, eyes and hair. He killed Jarac by entering the Dyad, almost destroying the psiberweb. He became a hard and often ruthless man, who pursued his goals without regard to others. During his time as a Jagernaut he learned to hate the Eubians with passion and would do everything possible to rid the universe of them. As an Imperator of Skolia he was both respected and feared. He remained jealous of Roca's much younger third husband Eldrinson Valdoria and never accepted him. Despite his secret longing for family Kurj lived a lonely life, never letting his occasional lovers close enough to form a stable relationship. However, when the Assembly wanted him to marry a chosen noblewoman for political reasons, he defied their order by marrying his lover Ami, a beautiful, sweet-natured and simple commoner. Shortly after that Kurj died in a battle which also cost the life of Ur Qox, the ruler of Eubian Concord. His successor as Imperator of Skolia was his younger half-sister Soz Valdoria. Several months after Kurj's death Ami gave birth to his son Kurjson.  Kelricson Garlin Valdoria Skolia  Kelricson Garlin Valdoria Skolia, also known as Kelric, is a Jagernaut Tertiary in the ISC, and in later books became Imperator of the Skolian Empire. Kelric was born on the planet Lyshriol, as the youngest of ten children of Eldrison Valdoria and Roca Skolia, a member of the royal Ruby Dynasty. He looks like his mother and maternal grandfather Jarac, who was tall with golden skin, eyes and hair. Kelric gained military training and served several years in the J-force. He was designated as one of the three imperial heirs (together with his brother Althor and sister Sauscony) to his older half-brother Kurj, who was Imperator of the Skolian Empire. But then Kelric's ship was damaged during an attack and he was stranded on the planet Coba for over eighteen years, all the while presumed deceased by his family. He became an expert in the dice game of Quis used as a form of universal communication on Coba, and was passed among several female governors as valuable property. He eventually escaped and made his way to Edgewhirl. There he learns that much of his family has been either killed or captured during the Radiance War. He takes a couple of jobs in an attempt to earn enough money to transport to his captive remaining family members on Earth. However, on a merchant exchange he is captured by an Aristo named Azar Taratus and sold to Eubian Finance Minister Tarquine Iquar. Eventually, Kelric escapes her as well. He visits the Lock which the Eubians had captured and deactivates it. He boldly escapes, only to end up once again stranded on another planet, this one called Spikedown. There he meets Jeejon, whom he later weds, but not before she helps him buy passage off the planet. Together they make their way to Earth where Kelric is reunited with his family. When the Ruby Dynasty family members were rescued from Earth by Pharaoh Dyhianna Selei, Kelric finally inherited the position of the Skolian Imperator, as his predecessors, his sister Sauscony and half-brother Kurj were dead or presumed dead. The Skolian Imperialate novels in which Kelric is a major character are: * The Last Hawk - about Kelric's life on Coba's various estates * Ascendant Sun - about Kelric's captivity and escape from Tarquine Iquar * \\"A Roll of the Dice\\" - Kelric as Imperator. * Carnelians - Kelric as Imperator.  Jaibriol III  Jaibriol III, also called Jai, is the son of both an Aristo and a psion ‚Äì his father is the previous Eubian Emperor Jaibriol Qox II and his mother is Sauscony Valdoria, the former Imperator of Skolia. Jai is the oldest of four children, has a sister named Rocalisa and brothers Vitar and Del-Kelric. Both parents of Jaibriol III are believed to be dead, though they are secretly living with their other children on the planet Prism. At seventeen years of age, Jai is crowned emperor of the Eubian Concord as Jaibriol III. After that he has to deal with many difficulties, one of which is that he is too young and inexperienced to rule an interstellar empire. Another one is that members of Eubian noble houses, including his own ministers, are not very happy with changes which the idealistic young ruler would like to bring into their life ‚Äì like peace with their enemy, the Skolians. When several assassination attempts threaten his life, he has to learn quickly how to survive in the hard and dangerous Eubian society. His closest ally becomes his cousin Corbal Xir, one of the very few Aristos who has voluntarily given up transcendence. A short time after ascending the throne Jaibriol III marries the Eubian Trade Minister Tarquine Iquar. The Skolian Imperialate novels in which Jairbiol III is a major character are: * The Moon's Shadow - a story how Jaibriol III became emperor of Eube * The Ruby Dice - the political battle to regain peace between Skolian Imperialite and Eubean Concord, takes place 10 years after the events of the Radiance war * Carnelians - the continued efforts to reach peace between the Skolian Imperialite and Eubian Concord, takes place nineteen years after the events of the Radiance war.  Tarquine Iquar  Tarquine Iquar, is the Minister of Finance and a key player in the politics of the Eubian Concord. Tarquine is a Highton Aristo, a member of the ruling class in the Eubian Concord. She is head of the Iquar line and aunt to Viquara Iquar, who was married to the late Eubian Emperor Ur Qox. Tarquine was briefly married in her youth but divorced soon, having thus no legitimate offspring. She values her independence and prefers enjoying charms of her provider slaves to an arranged Highton marriage. She is beautiful, very intelligent but ambitious, intrigant, unscrupulous and calculating. When we are first introduced to her, she is already over 100 years old (but looks young due to advanced anti-aging treatments) and a wealthy, powerful and dangerous woman. Tarquine is also one of the very few Aristos who had the Kyle Afferent Body removed from her brain because she began to hate how her transcending inflicted pain on others but could not resist the temptation of transcendence. She however has to keep this secret, as she would lose her title and property, maybe even life, if this ever became known. She was for a short time the owner of Skolian Imperator Kelric, after he was caught by Eubian pirates and sold on a slave auction. Determined to possess him, Tarquine didn't hesitate to pay incredible 14 million credits for him, the highest price ever paid for a provider. Kelric's escape after only a couple of days was a big disappointment for her. After Jaibriol III ascends the Eubian throne, Tarquine becomes his wife and Empress of Eube. Jai feels attracted to her although she is an Aristo and he a psion, because she has given up transcendence. To her shock, she developed genuine feelings for her much younger husband, seeking to promote his idealistic goals not because she believed in them, but for his sake.  Dyhianna Selei  Dyhianna Selei, also called Dehya, is the Ruby Pharaoh, titular head of the Skolian Imperialate. She is a mathematical genius, who can even predict future events with the help of her equations. She dislikes giving public speeches and dressing in long skirts (her preferred style is jumpsuit), and would rather spend her time solving math problems than ruling an empire. Dehya is the oldest living member of the Ruby Dynasty, actually even the oldest living Skolian. She is also a member of the imperial Triad and functions as its Assembly Key. Unlike her younger sister Roca, who has the beautiful figure of a former dancer, Dehya is small, slender with a childlike face and appears to be helpless and vulnerable. But anyone who would see her that way would be mistaken. Dehya is very strong-minded, courageous and has a superior intellect. Dehya was married twice with both weddings being arranged for her for political reasons by the Skolian governing body, the Assembly. Her first marriage to Seth Rockworth, a top officer from Earth, established the Icelandic treaty between Allieds and Skolians. They were married for several decades but had no children and later divorced. Her second marriage was strictly enforced by the Assembly ‚Äì against her will Dehya had to marry her own nephew Eldrin Valdoria. Eldrin was, like her, a Rhon psion and the Assembly was desperate for producing more Rhon heirs. Luckily, with time Dehya and Eldrin happened to fall in love with each other and are having a happy marriage now. Being so closely related to her husband however led to genetic issues with Dehya's offspring.  Taquinil Selei  Taquinil Selei is the firstborn son of Ruby Pharaoh Dyhianna Selei and her second husband and nephew Eldrin. He resembles his mother very much, not only with his small, slender figure and dark hair but also with his enormous intellect. He is a genius who since early childhood showed huge talent for math and computer science. He studied economy and became a professor at the prestigious University of Parthonia. His predictions concerning the course of stock exchange trade are legendary. Taquinil‚Äôs brilliant mind is very fragile. He is the most sensitive Rhon psion ever born, lacking the mental barriers that protect other empaths from emotions projected by people around them. When he was a child, his parents had to shield him constantly, which however became impossible as he grew older and wanted to have a life on his own. When he left to study at the university, his mind couldn‚Äôt endure the attacks of emotions and split into many different personalities. After a long therapy with strong medications Taquinil was able to incorporate all of these personalities again. Doctors also put a biomech inside his body that provided the chemicals his brain lacked, which were necessary to block empathic input. This enabled him to live an almost normal life. During the Radiance War when Orbiter, where his family lived, is attacked by Eubians, Taquinil and Dyhianna jump into the Lock to save themselves from their pursuers, their bodies becoming wavefunctions in the psiberspace. Unlike his mother, who later coalesces on the moon Opalite, Taquinil doesn‚Äôt want to return to his human existence. In psiberspace he finally finds peace from the onslaught of peoples‚Äô emotions that crushed his mind since he was a boy. Although it is unclear whether his mind and body can survive intact, without being slowly dissolved in the structure of the Kyle Web, he decides to stay. The content of Catch the Lightning indicates that 50 years after this incident Taquinil is still considered either dead or missing.  Planets = Raylicon  During the golden era of the Ruby Empire, Raylicon was the empire's capital and center of political power. Yet despite being the birthplace of two interstellar empires, today's Raylicon is a nearly abandoned world. The sole inhabitants are the Abaj, a group of warriors who are all clones of the original extinct Raylicans. They act as bodyguards to the Ruby Dynasty, the ruling family of the Skolian Empire.  Lyshriol  Lyshriol is the name of the homeworld of one branch of Ruby Dynasty. The Allieds call the planet Skyfall. Lyshriol is a heavy gravity world with two suns called Valdor and Aldan. It has a circular orbit and no axial tilt, so day and night are of the same length and there are no seasons. The main, most heavily populated provinces are Dalvador and Rillia. General population of Lyshriol is not very large, there are about 400 thousand people in the whole world. The language spoken there is called Trillian and although some dialects may exist, they are not very different from each other. The planet got its other name Skyfall because of its blue colored water and snow, which looks like sky fallen on earth. Water in any form on Lyshriol contains impurities which turn everything blue. This is however not dangerous for humans and doesn't cause any problems to the inhabitants who carry in their bodies nanomeds that degrade the blue dye. Lyshriol has lavender sky and big plains of green and silvery grass. Its biosphere is full of unique animals, famous are especially lyrine - animals that look like horses, with crystalline horns and silver, lavender or blue coats. A Lyshrioli meal is made up entirely of bubbles, which vary in size, color and flavour. Lyshriol is a planet where the humans and the planet seem to have been designed for some unknown purpose, probably by the ancient Ruby Empire. The humans have hinged hands with only four digits and unlike the majority of the population in the Skolian Imperialate, who are swarthy, dark-eyed and dark-haired, they have fair skin, violet eyes and red or blond hair. They have a genetic predisposition to illiteracy, and are mostly not able to learn how to read or write. They are however very musical with chiming voices, love singing, dancing and festivals. = Bards = Bards record the history of the Lyshrioli people in ballads. They also execute duties of judges, perform marriage ceremonies and lead armies in wars. Every village has its own Bard, a man who is chosen by his fellows for this position because of his ability to sing and lead. Only two Bard titles on Lyshriol are hereditary, passed on from father to son ‚Äì Dalvador Bard and Rillia Bard. = Memories = Memories are women with eidetic memories, who record important events with their mind. They wear long red robes. Their unique memory was genetically engineered into the Lyshrioli by geneticists of the long lost Ruby Empire. = Blue Dale Archers = Archers are a Lyshrioli ethnic group that was long believed to be extinct. They differ from the overall Lyshrioli population significantly with their lither build, pale skin, white-gold hair, silver eyes and pointed ears. They live in nomadic tribes in Blue Mountains, rarely leaving the area and avoid dealing with other Lyshrioli. Unlike them they are not farmers and make their living by hunting. It is suspected that the Blue Dale Archers are also the result of a genetic engineering project by the ancient Ruby Empire, since they have the ability to enter Kyle Space in a trance state, without the use of a Triad Chair or any other machinery.

They are very similar to the Zanj-descended populations in Iraq and Kuwait, and are known in Pakistan as Sheedis and in India as Siddis. The Kaffirs spoke a distinctive creole based on Portuguese, and the \\"Sri Lankan Kaffir language\\" (now extinct). Their cultural heritage includes the dance styles Kaffringna and Manja and their popular form of dance music Baila.  Etymology  The word Kaffir is an obsolete English term once used to designate natives from the African Great Lakes and Southern Africa coasts. In South Africa, it became a slur. \\"Kaffir\\" derives in turn from the Arabic kafir, \\"unbeliever\\".  History  Kaffirs have an oral history maintained by families that are descended from slaves from Africa. While Arabs were the original slave traders in the African Great Lakes slave trade, European colonialists later brought Bantu slaves to the Indian subcontinent. However fragmented official documentation may be, the recent public promotion of their music and dance forms allows the broader Sri Lankan society to acknowledge and better understand Kaffir history. Historical records indicate that Portuguese traders brought Siddis to the Indian subcontinent between 300‚Äì500 years ago. The Kaffirs were brought to Sri Lanka as a source of labour between the ninth and nineteenth centuries by Arab merchants.de Silva Jayasuriya, S. (2008). African identity in Asia: Cultural Effects of Forced Migration The Portuguese, Dutch, and the British used the Kaffirs as a part of their naval forces and for domestic labor.de Silva Jayasuriya, S. (1999). Portuguese in Sri Lanka: influence of substratum languages. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland 9(2): 251-270. When Dutch colonialists arrived around 1600, the Kaffirs worked on cinnamon plantations along the southern coast and some had settled in the Kandyan kingdom.de Silva Jayasuriya, S. (2006). Trading on a thalassic network: African migrations across the Indian Ocean. International Social Science Journal 58 (188), 215-225. Some research suggests that Kaffir slaves were employed as soldiers to fight against Sri Lankan kings, most likely in the Sinhalese‚ÄìPortuguese War (Mulleriyawa (1562), Randeniwela (1630), Gannoruwa (1638)).  Demography  The descendants of the freed Kaffir slaves are still a distinctive community are mainly found in the former occupied territories of the Portuguese colonists, mainly near Puttalam, in the North Western Province of Sri Lanka but also in areas such as Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Negombo. page 164. There was some contact between the Kaffir and the Burghers, communities of partly European ancestry on the East coast of Sri Lanka. page 31.  Religion  Sri Lanka Kaffirs originally adhered to traditional faiths. However, they now practice religions from Catholicism to Buddhism.  Culture  Sri Lanka Kaffir culture is a direct link back to their distant past in the African Great Lakes, which is rapidly disappearing.  Music  Baila is a form of dance music popular in Sri Lanka, originating centuries ago among the Kaffirs or Afro-Sri Lankan communities (mixed communities consisting of Portuguese, Bantu, and native Sri Lankan people). It has its origins in African folk music of the east coast of Africa was later amalgamated with European instruments and eastern and western rhythms, especially rhythms found in Spain and northern European folk music. page 52.  Language  They spoke a distinctive creole based on Portuguese. The extinct language was known as 'Sri Lankan Kaffir language'. It differs from Sri Lankan Portuguese creole.

The New York Times, June 5, 1970. Cartoons A self-taught artist, Irving became a cartoonist in the late 1920s.

Dorothy Prago and Jay Irving married in 1922, and their only child, Clifford Irving, was born November 5, 1930. Clifford Irving said about his father, \\"He didn‚Äôt want the family to know he was a cartoonist - they thought he was a 'respectable' insurance salesman - and he also felt that it would be a handicap to use his real name because of widespread antisemitism in the cartoon business. For a decade he kept his work a secret from the family and his real name a secret from the professional cartoon world. He drew under the name Jay Irving, which was derived from his real name, Irving Joel Rafsky. Then, in 1937, when he felt he was sufficiently successful, he confessed, and changed his name legally.\\" In 1932, Irving began a 13-year association with Collier's, drawing the weekly cartoon panel Collier's Cops. He also did covers for Collier's, including the famous Halloween cover for the October 26, 1940 issue. In 1946, he created the short-lived comic strip Willie Doodle, also about a fat and cheerful police officer, for the Herald-Tribune Syndicate. Pottsy His Pottsy strip was syndicated by the Tribune-News Syndicate from 1955 until 1970.

He also served as Minister of the Interior in Emir Faisal's government in Damascus. Riad Al Solh studied law and political science at the University of Paris. He spent most of his youth in Istanbul, as his father was a deputy in the Ottoman Parliament.  Career  A statue of Riad Al Solh stands in Beirut's Downtown district Solh served as prime minister of Lebanon twice. His first term was just after the Lebanon's independence (25 September 1943 ‚Äì 10 January 1945). Solh was chosen by president Bishara Al Khouri to be his first Prime Minister. Solh and Khouri achieved and implemented the National Pact (al Mithaq al Watani) in November 1943 that provided an official framework to accommodate the confessional differences in Lebanon. The National Pact was an unwritten gentleman's agreement. The Pact stated that president, prime minister and Speaker of the Parliament in Lebanon should be allocated to three major confessional groups based on the 1932 census, namely the Maronite Christians, the Sunni Muslims and the Shiite Muslims, respectively. During his first term, Solh also served as the Minister of Finance from September 1943 to July 1944, and the minister of supplies and reserves from 3 July 1944 to 9 January 1945. Solh held premiership again from 14 December 1946 to 14 February 1951Kamil Dib, \\"Warlords and Merchants, The Lebanese Business and Political Establishment\\", p. 89 again under the presidency of Bishara Al Khouri. Solh was critical of King Abdullah and played a significant role in granting the blessing of the Arab League's political committee to the All-Palestine Government during his second term.  Assassination  Solh escaped unhurt from an assassination attempt in March 1950. It was perpetrated by a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. However, several months after leaving office, he was gunned down on 17 July 1951 at Marka Airport in Amman by members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. The attack was perpetrated by three gunmen, who killed him in revenge for the execution of Anton Saadeh, one of the party's founding leaders.  Personal life  He secretly converted to Shia Islam since, compared to Sunni Islam, its inheritance laws meant that his daughters, his only children, could inherit a greater share of his wealth. Al Solh was married to Fayza Al Jabiri, the sister of two-time prime minister of Syria, Saadallah al-Jabiri.The Middle East enters the twenty-first century, By Robert Owen Freedman, Baltimore University 2002, page 218. They had five daughters and a son, Reda, who died in infancy. His eldest daughter, Aliya (1935‚Äì2007), continued in her father's path in the struggle for a free and secure Lebanon. Aliya propagated the rich cultural heritage of Lebanon abroad until her death in Paris. Lamia Al Solh (born 1937) is married to the late Prince Moulay Abdallah of Morocco, King Mohammed VI's uncle. Her children are Moulay Hicham, Moulay Ismail and a daughter Lalla Zineb. Mona Al Solh was formerly married to the Saudi Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz. She is the mother of the Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, Prince Khalid bin Talal and Princess Reema bint Talal. Bahija Al Solh Assad is married to Said Al Assad who is the former Lebanese ambassador to Switzerland and a former member of parliament. They have two sons and two daughters. His youngest daughter, Leila Al Solh Hamade, was appointed as one of the first two female ministers in Omar Karami's government.  Legacy  Patrick Seale's book The Struggle for Arab Independence (2011) deals with the history of the Middle East from the final years of the Ottoman Empire up to the 1950s and focuses on the influential career and personality of Solh. A square in downtown Beirut, Riad al-Solh Square,Young, M., The Ghosts of Martyrs Square: An Eyewitness Account of Lebanon's Life Struggle (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2010), p. 129. is named after him.

Located in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, the depot was partially redeveloped by Agility Trains from 2013 as a maintenance site when they were awarded the Intercity Express Programme. Location North Pole depot is located at two sites on either side of the West London Line, just north of North Pole junction. The western site with the six road maintenance shed at is located adjacent to, and on the south side of the Great Western Main Line (GWML) opposite Old Oak Common depot. The eastern site with the four road heavy maintenance shed at is accessed by rail via the western site passing under the West London line and the A219 (Scrubs Lane) at Mitre bridge.Rail Atlas Great Britain & Ireland, S.K.

Historically the land at the western site was undeveloped, most of it lying on the northern part of the open land known as Wormwood Scrubs; a limited amount of land was used for sidings south of the Great Western Main Line (GWML).Ordnance Survey. 1:2500; 1871, 1874, 1896, 1915, 1935. 1:10560; 1950‚Äì1, 1957, 1967. 1:10000; 1975‚Äì6, 1984 The depot was also used by Eurostar as the London depot for their fleet of Class 373 trains between 1994 and 2007 during the period when Eurostar trains ran from London Waterloo. The eastern part was developed for railway use in the last quarter part of the 19th century. By 1870 a burrowing junction chord had been built,The West London loop (GWR) (OS. 1:2500. 1896), later Victoria Branch (OS. 1:2500. 1915‚Äì6, 1935) connecting the West London Line (WLL) and the GWML by veering east off the WLL at North Pole Junction, then turning west passing under the WLL and connected to the GWML at West London Junction. In 1870 land in the northwestern corner of Little Wormwood Scrubs including Red House Farm and a gasworks was exchanged for in the south east corner; much of the land was taken up by the establishment of a railway works; the West London Works. Track also connected the loop chord and works onto the GWML to the east.Ordnance Survey. 1:2500. 1870‚Äì1, 1896 The works continued until after the second world war, the majority of the works had been closed and demolished by the early 1970s, leaving undeveloped ground.Ordnance Survey. 1:10560; 1920, 1938, 1951, 1957, 1967, 1975 North Pole International depot  A depot at North Pole, West London formed part of the 1970s aborted Channel Tunnel scheme. The Channel Tunnel Act 1987 sanctioned the construction of a train depot in the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea; the depot construction cost was ¬£76 million; in addition to the construction the line from Waterloo International railway station to the depot (West London Line) was electrified. The designers were Mott MacDonald, the British Rail civil engineer, and YRM. The depot opened in 1994, housing a 6-track shed used for light servicing and cleaning trains, a 4-track shed used for heavy overhaul and other facilities including a wheel lathe shed, a bogie repair shed, train washing and toilet and water changing facilities and a staff accommodation building. In 2005 the closure of the depot was announced to be replaced by one directly linked to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. On 14 November 2007 Eurostar moved its London terminus from Waterloo International station to St Pancras railway station and maintenance simultaneously moved to a new site at Temple Mills near Stratford International. Potential re-use by conventional UK rail operators was limited to its electric trains equipment being unsuitable for general and diesel train operations; the site lacked an overhead crane, turntables, fuelling facilities and it lacked a connection to the GWML. Intercity Express Programme The arrival of the third pre-series train (T2) at North Pole Train Maintenance Centre, as part of the Intercity Express Programme. In 2009, Agility Trains was listed as the preferred bidder for the Intercity Express Programme AT300 procurement; the North Pole depot was given as one of the sites to be used for the train's maintenance depot. These would be classes 800 and 802. Hitachi submitted planning documents in 2011; the main large maintenance shed was planned to be re-used with the addition of an inspection pit. Carriage wash facilities were to be replaced, and oil, fuelling, toilet emptying and other train service facilities installed. The remainder of the site was to have minor modifications. The former heavy maintenance shed was outside the scope of the redevelopment; most of the works were in the western part of the site. The main contractor for the conversion was VolkerFitzpatrick. The conversion work was practically complete by late 2015. The remodelled six road 400 m main building included : new inspection pits; a complete trainlift jack set for two five car trains on road 3, a bogie drop on road 4; an overhead crane on road 5; and a wheel lathe on road 6. Three of the six roads had overhead electrification. Future plans Part of the eastern section of the site was included in re-development plans for the Kensal gasworks in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. In one option a bridge would be created to provide a link between the existing communities to the south of the existing depot and a proposed Kensal Portobello Crossrail Station to the north of the railway lines on the former gasworks site. London and Continental Railways is seeking to use the remainder of the site not used by the Intercity Express Programme for housing or commercial use.

It begins at U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Falls Township outside of Morrisville and ends at PA 611 in the village of Kintnersville in Nockamixon Township. PA 32 passes through Washington Crossing Historic Park, a Revolutionary War-themed historical park on the site of George Washington's crossing on the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776. It also passes through the boroughs of Morrisville, Yardley, and New Hope. PA 32 was first designated in 1927 to run from Philadelphia northeast to Morrisville and then northwest to US 611/PA 2 in Kintnersville. The route ran concurrent with US 13 between Philadelphia and Morrisville. The southern terminus was cut back to US 1 in Morrisville in 1928. There were cancelled proposals in the 1930s to build a parkway along the corridor between Morrisville and New Hope and for a freeway in the 1960s between Interstate 95 (I-95, now I-295) in Yardley and US 202 in New Hope. PA 32 was extended to its current southern terminus in the 1980s, replacing a part of US 1 Alternate (US 1 Alt.). Parts of the road were rebuilt in the 2000s due to floods.  Route description  PA 32 northbound past the eastern terminus of PA 332 in Yardley PA 32 is a two-lane undivided road that parallels the Delaware River for most of its length. The road is popular for Sunday drivers, bikers, fishermen, and viewers of fall foliage. PA 32 begins at an interchange with the US 1 freeway in Falls Township, Bucks County, with access to southbound US 1 and from northbound US 1. At this interchange, the ramp from southbound PA 32 merges into the collector/distributor road from southbound US 1 that serves the interchanges with the northern termini of US 13 and US 1 Bus. From here, the route heads northeast on two-lane undivided West Bridge Street, forming the border between the borough of Morrisville to the north and Falls Township to the south. The road fully enters Morrisville and passes through residential areas with some businesses. PA 32 crosses the Delaware Canal and heads into commercial areas. At the Pennsylvania Avenue intersection, the road name changes to East Bridge Street. The route turns northwest onto North Delmorr Avenue, with East Bridge Street continuing to the northeast to the Lower Trenton Bridge over the Delaware River into the city of Trenton, New Jersey. PA 32 passes between homes to the west and Williamson Park to the east, curving north before it heads northwest along the west bank of the Delaware River, with the Delaware Canal a short distance to the west. The road intersects East Trenton Avenue just west of where that road crosses the river on the Calhoun Street Bridge. The route leaves Morrisville for Lower Makefield Township, where the name changes to River Road. The canal heads farther to the west and the road passes through wooded areas of homes. PA 32 continues northwest along the Delaware River and passes under the West Trenton Railroad Bridge, which carries CSX's Trenton Subdivision and SEPTA's West Trenton Line, before entering the borough of Yardley and becoming South Delaware Avenue. The road passes more homes in the borough and intersects the eastern terminus of PA 332, where the road name changes to North Delaware Avenue and it crosses Buck Creek. PA 32 southbound through Washington Crossing The route leaves Yardley for Lower Makefield Township again, regaining the River Road name and passing through woods. PA 32 passes under the Scudder Falls Bridge, which carries I-295 over the Delaware River. The road curves north and continues through wooded areas with some homes, crossing Dyers Creek before entering Upper Makefield Township at the Mount Eyre Road intersection. The route continues along the river and crosses Houghs Creek before it heads northwest into the residential community of Washington Crossing. Here, PA 32 passes to the west of Washington Crossing Historic Park, which is situated along the river, and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 532 and the approach to the Washington Crossing Bridge. The road continues through the historic park before leaving Washington Crossing and heading past fields and woods with some residences. The route curves west and turns southwest away from the Delaware River to cross the Delaware Canal, coming to an intersection with Taylorsville Road before it passes over Jericho Creek. Here, PA 32 curves back northwest and runs through wooded areas of residential developments before passing through a mix of homes, woods, and fields. The road passes through another tract of Washington Crossing Historic Park and crosses into Solebury Township. The route heads north through forested areas and crosses Pidcock Creek, drawing closer to the canal and the river. PA 32 northbound in New Hope approaching PA 179PA 32 enters the borough of New Hope, where it intersects the northern terminus of PA 232 and crosses Dark Hollow Run and the canal. The route becomes South Main Street and heads through the commercial downtown of New Hope, passing the Bucks County Playhouse as it crosses Aquetong Creek. In the center of town, the road crosses PA 179, which heads east to the New Hope‚ÄìLambertville Bridge over the Delaware River to the city of Lambertville, New Jersey. PA 32 becomes North Main Street and heads past more downtown businesses before heading into wooded residential areas. The route crosses back into Solebury Township and heads through woods as River Road, turning northwest away from the river and crossing the canal. PA 32 briefly becomes a four-lane divided highway as it crosses Rabbit Run and comes to an interchange with the US 202 freeway, which heads east across the Delaware River on the New Hope‚ÄìLambertville Toll Bridge. Past this interchange, the route becomes two lanes and undivided again as it bends west around a residential subdivision. The road turns northwest again and runs to the west of the canal and the river, passing east of homes. PA 32, along with the canal, heads farther away from the river as it runs through forested areas. The route intersects PA 263, which heads northeast to the Centre Bridge‚ÄìStockton Bridge over the Delaware River into the borough of Stockton, New Jersey, in the community of Centre Bridge. Past PA 263, the road heads west through forests with some fields, running parallel with the Delaware Canal and the Delaware River again. Along this stretch, the route crosses Cuttalosa Creek. PA 32 curves northwest and passes through the community of Lumberville, where the road has access to the Lumberville‚ÄìRaven Rock Bridge, a pedestrian bridge providing access to Bull's Island Recreation Area in New Jersey, and crosses Paunnacussing Creek. The route enters Plumstead Township and runs through more forests, crossing Hickory Creek before reaching the community of Point Pleasant. Here, PA 32 turns north and crosses the Tohickon Creek into Tinicum Township, where the road passes a few homes before heading into forests. The road continues north a short distance to the west of the Delaware Canal and the Delaware River, heading across Smithtown Creek and Tinicum Creek before it crosses to the east side of the canal. PA 32 heads into a mix of fields and woods with some homes in the community of Erwinna, where it passes to the east of Tinicum County Park. The route passes through more rural areas and reaches the community of Uhlerstown, where the Uhlerstown‚ÄìFrenchtown Bridge heads east into the borough of Frenchtown, New Jersey and connects to Route 12. The road passes through more farmland and woods with some homes on the west bank of the river, curving northwest and passing through the community of Lodi. PA 32 enters Bridgeton Township and passes through more rural areas with some homes before passing through the residential community of Upper Black Eddy, where the Upper Black Eddy‚ÄìMilford Bridge heads northeast across the river to the borough of Milford, New Jersey. Past here, the route curves west and crosses the Delaware Canal, continuing through wooded areas with some fields and residences and heading across Falls Creek. The road crosses into Nockamixon Township and runs southwest between dense forests to the south and the canal and the river to the north. PA 32 continues west to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 611 in the community of Kintnersville. History PA 32 southbound past the northern terminus at PA 611 in Kintnersville When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 32 was designated as part of Legislative Route 252 between Morrisville and Yardley. PA 32 was designated in 1927 to run between Philadelphia and US 611/PA 2 in Kintnersville, heading northeast along US 13 to Morrisville before turning northwest on its present alignment. At this time, the entire route was paved. In 1928, the southern terminus was cut back to US 1 (Bridge Street) in Morrisville, removing the concurrency with US 13. In 1932, a parkway was proposed along the route from Morrisville to New Hope; however, it was never built. In 1969, another proposal was created for a $30 million PA 32 freeway from I-95 (now I-295) near Yardley to US 202 in New Hope. At the time, this freeway was to be completed by 1985. However, the proposal never came about. In the 1980s, PA 32 was extended southwest to its current terminus, replacing a part of US 1 Alt., which had replaced the earlier US 1 designation, on Bridge Street. Due to its route along the Delaware River, PA 32 is prone to floods. Several floods, including the Mid- Atlantic Flood of June 2006, left many parts of the road impassable. The sections of road between PA 263 and Greenhill Road and near Fleecydale Road in Solebury Township and between PA 611 and Narrows Hill Road in Nockamixon Township were closed from the damage. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation undertook a $11.4 million project to fix these sections of road in 2008. The section between PA 263 and Greenhill Road was completed by May 2008 and the section between PA 611 and Narrows Hill Road was completed later that year. Road closures and detours have affected many businesses along PA 32, with many seeing a decline in customers and some closing down or being put up for auction. Major intersectionsPA 32 Alternate Truck=Morrisville Pennsylvania Route 32 Alternate Truck is a truck route bypassing a weight-restricted bridge over a tributary to the Delaware River in Morrisville, on which trucks over 34 tons are prohibited. The route follows US 1 and Pennsylvania Avenue. It was signed in 2013. Point Pleasant‚ÄìKintnersville Pennsylvania Route 32 Alternate Truck was a truck route between Point Pleasant and PA 611 in Kintnersville, bypassing a weight- restricted bridge over the Delaware Canal in Tinicum Township, on which trucks over 35 tons are prohibited. The route followed Point Pleasant Pike, PA 413, and PA 611. It was signed in 2013 and decommissioned in 2018 following a bridge repair, removing the need for weight-restriction.

A reaction to the ornate and mass-produced elements of the Victorian and other Revival styles popular throughout the last half of the 19th century, the American Foursquare was plain, often incorporating handcrafted \\"honest\\" woodwork (unless purchased from a mail-order catalog). This style incorporates elements of the Prairie School and the Craftsman styles. It is also sometimes called Transitional Period. The hallmarks of the style include a basically square, boxy design, two-and-one-half stories high, usually with four large, boxy rooms to a floor, a center dormer, and a large front porch with wide stairs. The boxy shape provides a maximum amount of interior room space, to use a small city lot to best advantage. Other common features included a hipped roof, arched entries between common rooms, built-in cabinetry, and Craftsman-style woodwork. A typical design would be as follows: first floor, from front to back, on one side, the living room and dining room; while on the other side, the entry room or foyer, stairway and kitchen. Sometimes a bathroom was also included. Second floor, front to back, on one side, bedroom, bathroom and bedroom; while on the other side, bedroom, stairway and bedroom. The bedrooms had a slightly longer dimension along the front and back of the house with side-by-side closets between the bedrooms. This gave a very efficient layout, with a bedroom in each corner and a centralized bathroom and stairway. The top floor was generally just a big open space with one to four dormers. The basement generally contained a large natural convection furnace or boiler. Models An advertisement for a Sears Roebuck foursquare house Foursquare houses may be built with a variety of materials, including bricks and wood frames. Later models include built-in shelves and other amenities. Large tracts of these homes exist in older Midwestern urban neighborhoods, particularly streetcar suburbs, but the design was used everywhere. As with other styles in streetcar suburbs, it was tailored to relatively narrow lots, and was multi-story, allowing more square footage on a smaller footprint. The American Foursquare style is occasionally revived in new developments, although its appeal is as a \\"traditional-looking\\" style rather than a fully authentic one, often including modern two-car attached garages and other features absent in originals, and typically built on larger lots. History Wegeforth-Wucher house, Burlingame, San Diego The American Foursquare or \\"Prairie Box\\" was a post-Victorian style, which shared many features with the Prairie architecture pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright. During the early 1900s and 1910s, Wright even designed his own variations on the Foursquare, including the Robert M. Lamp House, \\"A Fireproof House for $5000\\", and several two-story models for American System-Built Homes. Unlike other houses of the style, Wright's versions featured more open main floor plans achieved by removing or minimizing partitions between the entry, living room, and dining room. He in turn inspired other Prairie School architects, such as Walter Burley Griffin, to design similar Foursquares in the following decades. Later Foursquares often had the same type of interiors as bungalows with open floor plans, many built-ins, and fireplaces. Many examples are trimmed with tiled roofs, cornice-line brackets, or other details drawn from Craftsman, Italian Renaissance, or Mission architecture.  Mail-order era  The Foursquare was a popular mail-order era style along with the California bungalow. When one was ordered, it came in a boxcar with a book of directions and all the parts pre-cut and numbered for self-assembly. These homes are particularly common in neighborhoods near rail-lines built in this era. The largest mail-order house catalog companies were Sears and Aladdin.

Pitcher Plants of Borneo. Second Edition. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Description N. ampullaria with climbing stems and rosette pitchers. Due to its unique pitcher morphology and unusual growth habit, it is difficult to confuse N. ampullaria with any other species in the genus. Francis Ernest Lloyd translated Troll's 1932 account of this species as follows:Lloyd, F.E. 1942. The Carnivorous Plants. Chronica Botanica 9. Ronald Press Company, New York, U.S.A. xvi + 352 pp. > \\"I came across N. ampullaria among the massive vegetations of a swamp-forest > on the island of Siberut off the west coast of Sumatra. It was a fabulous, > unforgettable sight. Everywhere, through the network of lianas the > peculiarly-formed pitchers of this species gleamed forth, often in tight > clusters and, most remarkably, the muddy moss-overgrown soil was spotted > with the pitchers of this plant, so that one got the impression of a > carpet.\\" The stem of N. ampullaria is light brown in colour and may climb to 15 m in height. Leaves are light green, up to 25 cm long, and 6 cm wide. Pitchers are produced at the ends of short tendrils no more than 15 cm long. The urceolate pitchers are generally quite small, rarely exceeding 10 cm in height and 7 cm in width. The peristome is greatly incurved, with the inner section accounting for around 85% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. Upper pitchers are very rarely produced and are considerably smaller than those formed on rosettes or offshoots. Pitchers range in colouration from light green throughout to completely dark red, with many intermediate forms recorded. The pitchers of N. ampullaria from Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are almost exclusively green throughout or green with red speckles; the red forms are mostly confined to Borneo. A large-pitchered form has been recorded from New Guinea. The inflorescence of N. ampullaria is a dense panicle. It is the only Nepenthes species recorded from Sumatra or Peninsular Malaysia that produces paniculate inflorescences. All parts of the plant are densely covered with short, brown hairs when young. The indumentum of mature plants is more sparse, except on the inflorescenes. Distribution and habitat One of the most widespread Nepenthes species, N. ampullaria is native to Borneo, the Maluku Islands, New Guinea, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, and Thailand. It has also been recorded from many smaller islands, including Bangka, Bengkalis, Ko Lanta, Ko Tarutao, Langkawi, Mendol, Mentawai Islands (Siberut), Meranti Islands (Padang, Rangsang, Tebing Tinggi), Nias, Penang, Riau Islands (Lingga Islands, Natuna Islands, Mansur, M. 2012.

In Borneo, it occurs usually on relatively flat terrain in kerangas forest, peat swamp forest, and degraded swamp forest, at elevations of 0 to 1000 m.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. In Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, it grows from sea-level to 1100 m altitude on flat terrain in heath forest, padang (meaning \\"field\\" in Malay), belukar, peat swamp forest, degraded swamp forest, and in padi fields.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. In New Guinea, it is predominantly present in Araucaria forests. The species has also been recorded from secondary forests, open microphyllous vegetation, and swamp grassland. Carnivory N. ampullaria is well-adapted to capturing leaf litter. Nepenthes ampullaria has largely moved away from carnivory and acquires a substantial portion of its nutrients from digesting leaf matter that falls to the forest floor. It is thus partially detritivorous. The species has developed several unique traits as a consequence of its adaptation to trapping leaf litter: * It is one of the few species in the genus to lack \\"lunate\\" cells in its pitchers.Pant, D.D. & S. Bhatnagar 1977. Morphological studies in Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Phytomorphology 27: 13‚Äì34.Moran, J.A., B.J. Hawkins, B.E. Gowen & S.L. Robbins 2010. Ion fluxes across the pitcher walls of three Bornean Nepenthes pitcher plant species: flux rates and gland distribution patterns reflect nitrogen sequestration strategies. Journal of Experimental Botany 61(5): 1365‚Äì1374. These are modified stomatal guard cells which, it is thought, deny prey a foothold in the pitcher. * The pitcher lid is atypical, being very small and reflexed, such that leaf litter is allowed to fall directly into the pitcher. * Nectar glands, which play an important role in prey capture, are very rare and in some cases completely absent from the pitcher lid. * The marginal glands of the peristome are greatly reduced compared to those of other species. * In terrestrial pitchers, the glandular region extends almost to the peristome, such that there is little or no conductive waxy zone.Macfarlane, J.M. 1893. Observations on pitchered insectivorous plants. (Part II.). Annals of Botany 7(4): 403‚Äì458.Jebb, M.H.P. 1991. An account of Nepenthes in New Guinea. Science in New Guinea 17(1): 7‚Äì54.Di Giusto, B., M. Gu√©roult, N. Rowe & L. Gaume 2009. Chapter 7: The Waxy Surface in Nepenthes Pitcher Plants: Variability, Adaptive Significance and Developmental Evolution. In: S.N. Gorb (ed.) Functional Surfaces in Biology: Adhesion Related Phenomena. Volume 2. Springer. pp. 183‚Äì204. The waxy zone functions by causing prey to slip and fall into the digestive fluid. * The plant's architecture, consisting of subsurface runners and offshoots, is unusual for the genus. The species often forms a \\"carpet\\" of pitchers covering the soil. This serves to maximise the area over which falling debris may be intercepted. * The pitchers of N. ampullaria are relatively long-lived, as the species relies on a slow accumulation of nutrients over time. * It is thought that infaunal organisms, such as mosquito larvae, facilitate breakdown of leaf litter and aid in the transfer of nitrogen from it to the plant by means of the excretion of ammonium ions. Bacterial breakdown of leaf matter is also known to produce ammonium ions. It has been shown that foliar stable nitrogen isotope (15N) abundance in N. ampullaria plants growing under forest canopy (litterfall present) is significantly lower than in plants without access to litterfall. Conversely, total nitrogen concentrations are higher in these plants compared to those growing in open sites with no litterfall. A 2003 study estimated that N. ampullaria plants growing under forest canopy derive 35.7% (¬±0.1%) of their foliar nitrogen from leaf litter. A 2011 study found that N. ampullaria derives 41.7% (¬±5.5%) of its laminar nitrogen and 54.8% (¬±7.0%) of its pitcher nitrogen from leaf litter, and showed that detritivory increased the rate of net photosynthesis in the laminae. Pitcher infauna At least 59 infaunal species have been recorded from the pitchers of N. ampullaria.Adlassnig, W., M. Peroutka & T. Lendl 2011. Traps of carnivorous pitcher plants as a habitat: composition of the fluid, biodiversity and mutualistic activities. Annals of Botany 107(2): 181‚Äì194. Among these are one of the smallest known species of Old World frog, Microhyla nepenthicola, and the crab spider, Misumenops nepenthicola.Das, I. & A. Haas. 2010. New species of Microhyla from Sarawak: Old World's smallest frogs crawl out of miniature pitcher plants on Borneo (Amphibia: Anura: Microhylidae). Zootaxa 2571: 37‚Äì52.Gururaja, K.V. 2010.

Archives of Microbiology 196(10): 709‚Äì717. Infraspecific taxa A red form of N. ampullaria A tiny upper pitcher of N. ampullaria from Sumatra. Such aerial traps are commonly or rarely produced depending on the genus and appear almost vestigial, often being too small to catch prey. The most recently described variety, N. ampullaria var. racemosa, occurs in Sarawak and has a racemose inflorescence. B. H. Danser considered the other varieties to be unimportant.Danser, B.H. 1928.

Early life and naval career Bonham-Carter was educated at Elstree School and the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. He entered the Royal Navy, becoming a captain in 1948, and rear-admiral in 1957. He was mentioned in despatches in 1943. From 1949‚Äì1951 he was in command 2nd Frigate Squadron, and then was Naval Attache in Rome 1951 to 1953. After spending 1953 to 1955 at the Admiralty he became Commanding Officer of in 1955 and 1956. His last posting was as Chief of Staff Mediterranean (1957‚Äì1959). Treasurer to the Duke of Edinburgh In 1959 Bonham-Carter joined the Household of the Duke of Edinburgh as Treasurer to the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1970 he was appointed Private Secretary, and retired from both positions at the end of that year. In 1961, during a Royal visit to Nepal, he was credited with sharing a tiger kill with Sir Michael Adeane in a royal tiger hunt. The task of shooting the tiger had fallen to him after the Queen had declined, the Duke of Edinburgh had been unable to do so due to having his trigger finger in a splint, and the then Foreign Secretary Alec Douglas-Home had missed twice. He was appointed Extra Equerry in 1970. From 1971 until his death he was also Secretary and Registrar of the Order of Merit. Bonham-Carter was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1959, and a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1962. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1968, and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1970. He is the grandfather of actor Crispin Bonham-Carter.

It receives fibers from the motor, sensory, and parasympathetic components of the facial nerve and sends fibers that will innervate the lacrimal glands, submandibular glands, sublingual glands, tongue, palate, pharynx, external auditory meatus, stapedius, posterior belly of the digastric muscle, stylohyoid muscle, and muscles of facial expression. The geniculate ganglion contains special sensory neuronal cell bodies for taste, from fibers coming up from the tongue through the chorda tympani and from fibers coming up from the roof of the palate through the greater petrosal nerve. Sensory and parasympathetic inputs are carried into the geniculate ganglion via the nervus intermedius. Motor fibers are carried via the facial nerve proper. The greater petrosal nerve, which carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers, emerges from the anterior aspect of the ganglion. The motor fibers of the facial nerve proper and parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular and pterygopalatine ganglia do not synapse in the geniculate ganglion. The afferent fibers carrying pain, temperature, and touch from the posterior auricular nerve, as well as those carrying special sensory (taste) fibers from the tongue (via the chorda tympani), do not synapse in the geniculate ganglion. Instead, the cells of the geniculate ganglion relay the signal to the appropriate brainstem nucleus, much like the Dorsal root ganglion neurons relay signal to nuclei in the spinal cord The geniculate ganglion is one of several ganglia of the head and neck. Like the others, it is a bilaterally distributed structure, with each side of the face having a geniculate ganglion.

The anthropology of art focuses on historical, economic and aesthetic dimensions in non-Western art forms, including what is known as 'tribal art'. History Franz Boas, one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, conducted many field studies of the arts, helping create a foundation to the field. His book, Primitive Art (1927), summarizes his main insights into so-called 'primitive' art forms, with a detailed case study on the arts of the Northwest Pacific Coast.Franz Boas. (1927) Primitive art. The famous anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss took Boas' analyses further in his book The Way of the Masks, where he traced changes in the plastic form of Northwest Pacific masks to patterns of intercultural interaction among the indigenous peoples of the coast.Claude L√©vi-Strauss. (1982) The Way of the Masks. Essential contributions made to the field of art anthropology by M.N. Haidle showcase the biological changes necessary for humans to evolve creative capacities.Haidle (2014): https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miriam_Haidle/publication/279253079_Examining_the_evolution_of_artistic_capacities_searching_for_mushrooms/links/5673f83b08aee7a427459d44.pdf These changes include precise hand-eye coordination, improvements in information processing systems, improved aesthetic awareness and prioritization, process-oriented teaching, advancements in communication, and the application of abstract concepts.Haidle (2014): https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miriam_Haidle/publication/279253079_Examining_the_evolution_of_artistic_capacities_searching_for_mushrooms/links/5673f83b08aee7a427459d44.pdf Individuals that have developed such structural and cognitive advancements are enabled to produce art and will be evolutionarily selected for. Ellen Dissanayake has published work which contributes to this concept and suggests that creativity was practiced by only the most fit individuals within a population. Since artistic involvement is not an essential duty, it could only be produced once survival tasks were completed, and therefore, individuals with the highest fitness could partake. This exemplifies the selection of artistic individuals, since fitness is concomitant with participation in leisure activity.Dissanayake (1974): DOI:10.2307/1572893 Gillian Morriss-Kay addressed preliminary artistic patters like zig-zag, criss-cross, and parallel lines.Morriss-Kay, G.M. 2010. The evolution of human artistic creativity. Journal of Anatomy 216(2) : 158-176. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01160.x Use of patterns indicate advancements in cognition and signify an evolutionary step towards increasing complexity in imaginative capability.Morriss-Kay, G.M. 2010.

The evolution of human artistic creativity. Journal of Anatomy 216(2) : 158-176. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01160.x The Problem of Art One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.Robert Layton. (1981) The Anthropology of Art. Thus, there is no consensus on a single, cross-cultural definition of 'art' in anthropology.Howard Morphy & Morgan Perkins. (2006) Introduction, in The Anthropology of Art: A Reader.G. Angioni, Fare dire sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture, Nuoro, il Maestrale, 2011 To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' Primitive Art, Claude L√©vi-Strauss' The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally-specific 'aesthetics'. More recently, in his book Art and Agency, Alfred Gell proposed a new definition of 'art' as a complex system of intentionality, where artists produce art objects to effect changes in the world, including (but not restricted to) changes in the aesthetic perceptions of art audiences.Alfred Gell. (1998) Art and Agency. Gell's ideas have stirred a large controversy in the anthropology of art in the 2000s.Ross Bowden. (2004) A Critique of Alfred Gell on Art and Agency.

MOBIA was a non- collecting institution dedicated to exploration of the Bible's legacy in Jewish and Christian art. Started in 1997 as an art gallery at the American Bible Society building in New York, the museum became an independent entity on May 12, 2005. The museum aimed to become a nationally recognized center of expertise on art and the Bible, while maintaining a secular distance from its subject. Although it grew out of the American Bible Society and was subsidized by that organization, it was not a religious institution and took no stand on religion itself. Rather, MOBIA hoped to open dialogue on a subject it considered under-explored, the influence of religion on art, by providing exhibits and educational programs to visitors. In April 2015, the museum announced it would be closing in June after failing to find a new space. The institution had been paying only $1 in rent on its space in the headquarters of the American Bible Society, but the latter's impending move to Philadelphia made the continuation of that arrangement impossible.  Building  The Museum of Biblical Art was located on the second floor of the American Bible Society's headquarters building at the corner of Broadway and 61st Street, between Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York. The main exhibition space was created after extensive renovation, and the museum also included an education center for lectures, concerts, and children's activities. Principal architects were Randall Goya and Sara Lopergolo, of G&L; Architects of New York. In 2015, due to the intention of the American Bible Society to sell their New York building and move to Philadelphia, MOBIA announced that it was seeking a new location, but the search was unsuccessful and the museum closed permanently on June 14, 2015.  Exhibitions  The Museum of Biblical Art presented four exhibitions per year which highlight the changing relationship of faith ‚Äî whether express, implied, or absent ‚Äî to art. MOBIA's first exhibition was \\"Coming Home!: Self-taught Artists, the Bible, and the American South\\", featuring ninety-five works by seventy-three artists. The exhibit explored the way the Bible, in the context of evangelical Christianity, has influenced the subject matter, meaning and function of art made by Southern self-taught artists. Later exhibitions included \\"The Next Generation: Contemporary Expressions of Faith\\", which dealt with contemporary religious art and artists, in partnership with Christians in the Visual Arts, and \\"Let There Be Light: Oil Lamps from the Holy Land\\", exploring the uses of clay oil lamps through history, on loan from the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem.BLMJ.org Later, \\"On Eagles' Wings: The King James Bible Turns 400\\" explored the tumultuous origins and dramatic impact of a literary masterpiece widely considered one of the most celebrated books in the English-speaking world. The exhibition explored the historic context in which the King James Bible was translated and published, beginning with an examination of its predecessors, most notably the Bishops' Bible sponsored by Queen Elizabeth I in 1568 and singled out as the model that the translators commissioned by King James were to follow as closely as possible. The exhibition presented the touchstones of the translation process, examining how this work was and continues to be inspirational for various audiences over time. \\"The Land of Light and Promise: 50 Years Painting Jerusalem and Beyond, Ludwig Blum (1891-1974)\\" showcased that artist. Known as the \\"Painter of Jerusalem,\\" Ludwig Blum immigrated to Palestine in 1923 from what is now the Czech Republic. A veteran of the First World War and an academically trained painter, Blum set about depicting the Middle East, most notably the Holy Land, both through vast topographical scenes and through small-scale street and marketplace scenes. He portrayed Palestine, and later Israel, with an intimacy borne of his love for his adopted homeland and its people, and he painted Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sites alike, largely devoid of religious overtones. Other exhibitions included \\"Walls Speak: The Narrative Art of Hildreth Mei√®re\\", \\"Finding Comfort in Difficult Times: A Selection of Soldiers' Bibles\\" and \\"Louis C. Tiffany and the Art of Devotion\\". For its final exhibit, the museum drew the largest crowds in its history for a show of 15th century sculpture by Donatello, Brunelleschi, Nanni di Banco, Luca della Robbia and others from the Florence Cathedral, pieces never before seen in the United States.

It officially started on May 15, 1961, in the eastern Pacific and lasted until November 30, 1961. Ten tropical cyclones, 9 named storms (Madeline and Simone were operationally considered a tropical storm) and two hurricanes formed during the 1961 season, none of the hurricanes reached beyond category 1 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The 1961 Pacific hurricane season featured only one notable tropical cyclone: Hurricane Tara. Tara devastated southwest Mexico, causing 436-500 fatalities, making it the fourth deadliest tropical cyclone in the Eastern Pacific basin.

However, in 1960, there were five hurricane, but only two in 1961. Although there were an abnormally high number of tropical cyclones for its time, 1961 fell below the 1995-2008 average number of tropical cyclones, which is 15 tropical cyclones, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. In addition, there were eleven tropical cyclones, two hurricanes, but no major hurricanes. However, in post- analysis, it was noted that \\"Tropical Storm Madeline\\" was only a tropical depression, and shouldn't have been named. Tropical cyclone activity first began about a month after the official start of the season, with Iva developed on June 9. After Iva dissipated on June 11, there was another period of lack of tropical cyclogenesis for almost a month, ending after Tropical Storm Joanne developed on July 10. July was an active month, with four tropical cyclones developing. However, the month of August and September combined featured only two tropical cyclones. After September, there were two tropical cyclones in October, both existing only on October 3 and October 4. Two more tropical cyclones developed in November, which was the first time on record, and would not occur again until 2006. Operationally, the San Francisco Weather Bureau issued advisories for Tropical Storm Simone, which existed in early November south of Mexico. The system originated from the remnants of Atlantic Hurricane Hattie, crossing into the basin on November 1; on the same day, the system was named Simone. The system consisted of a broad circulation with gale force winds, which the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis committee referred as a Central American gyre; as it lacked a well-defined center, the system was removed as a tropical cyclone in 2019. The gyre intensified before moving ashore Mexico on November 3, whereupon it dissipated. Systems=Hurricane Iva Hurricane Iva was the first storm of the season, as the Eastern Pacific continued through the name lists regardless of the year. Iva was first observed on June 9 280 mi (420.61 km/h) southwest of Puerto √Ångel. The storm slowly curved northward, and Iva did not intensify past its peak with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). By June 11, Iva made landfall near Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, Mexico at the same intensity. Iva transitioned into an extratropical cyclone less than six hours later, and the remnants completely dissipated on June 12. Tropical Storm Joanne Tropical Storm Joanne developed on July 10 175 mi (281.63 km) southwest of Socorro Island. Winds were at 50 mph (80 km/h) upon development, and no further intensification would occur while Joanne headed generally westward. Joanne dissipated two days later 883 mi (1421 km/h) south- southeast of Guadalupe Island. Tropical Storm Kathleen Tropical Storm Kathleen developed on July 14 in a similar location to Tropical Storm Joanne. Kathleen headed west-southwestward and did not intensify past 50 mph (85 km/h). By July 16, Kathleen dissipated. Tropical Storm Liza Tropical Storm Liza stayed at sea. Tropical Depression Madeline Tropical Depression Madeline stayed at sea. Tropical Storm Naomi Tropical Storm Naomi stayed at sea. Tropical Storm Orla Tropical Storm Orla came close to the Baja California Peninsula. but stayed at sea. Tropical Storm Pauline Tropical Storm Pauline stayed at sea. Tropical Storm Rebecca Tropical Storm Rebecca stayed at sea. Hurricane Tara Hurricane Tara was one of the deadliest Pacific hurricanes on record. It was the final storm of the season, forming on November 10 about 230 mi (365 km) off the coast of Mexico. It strengthened to reach 85 mph (140 km/h) before making landfall in the Mexican state of Guerrero near Zihuatanejo. Hurricane Tara dissipated on November 12, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to locations inundated by 10 days of precipitation. Damage was light in the major port city of Acapulco, though further west along the coast, the effects of Tara were much worse. The city of Nuxco in Tecp√°n de Galeana municipality received the most damage and deaths from the hurricane. Throughout Mexico, at least 436 fatalities were reported, and damage exceeded $16 million (1961 USD). Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1961. Simone was operationally considered a tropical storm, but was removed as a tropical cyclone by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis committee in 2019. No names were retired, and the names on this portion of list 1 were used again in the 1968 season. This is the same list as list 1 used during the 1960-1965 Pacific hurricane seasons, names that were not assigned are marked in gray. {width=\\"90%\\"    *  * *Iva *Joanne *Kathleen *Liza *Madeline *Naomi  *Orla *Pauline *Rebecca *Simone *Tara * * } The Central Pacific used names and numbers from the Western Pacific's typhoon list.

The census record has the 1896 and the death certificate has the 1897 birth date. He was the son of Walter and Mattie (nee Embers or Embry) Weaver. Walter Weaver's 1952 Kentucky death certificate indicates that he was born in Port Gibson, MS, the county seat of Claiborne County. That area's economy was heavily agricultural, relying on African American labor to produce a profitable cotton crop. After Walter Weaver migrated to Louisville, KY, Port Gibson would play a role in the preservation and dissemination of a blues tradition indigenous to the Mississippi Delta. This tradition, in the form in which Walter Weaver experienced it, likely was a foundation upon which Sylvester Weaver built his unique performance style. Biography Weaver recorded \\"Longing for Daddy Blues\\" and \\"I've Got to Go and Leave My Daddy Behind\\" with the blues singer Sara Martin on October 23, 1923, in New York City. Two weeks later, as a soloist, he recorded \\"Guitar Blues\\" and \\"Guitar Rag\\", the first blues guitar instrumentals. Both recordings were released by Okeh Records. They are the first recorded country blues, and the first known recordings of a bottleneck- style slide guitar. \\"Guitar Rag\\" (played on a Guitjo) became a blues classic. A cover version recorded by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys in the 1930s as \\"Steel Guitar Rag\\" became a country music standard. Louisville city directories published between 1916 and 1930 indicate that Weaver, like his parents, lived most of his life in the Smoketown neighborhood and that he supported his music career with employment in various blue-collar jobs. These directories list his occupation as porter (1916‚Äì1920), packer (1925), apartment janitor (1928), and chauffeur (1930). The 1938 directory suggests financial hardship during the Great Depression; it indicates that Weaver was living with his parents. By 1949, he and his wife, Dorothy, had moved to a better neighborhood, near Cherokee Park, where they lived in a basement apartment, probably a modest accommodation. His move from Smoketown is roughly contemporaneous with the construction of the Sheppard Square housing project, so he and his parents may have been displaced when the project absorbed his Roselane Court and their Clay Street residences. Weaver recorded about 50 more songs, sometimes accompanied by Sara Martin, until 1927. On some recordings from 1927 he was accompanied by Walter Beasley and the singer Helen Humes. Weaver often played his guitar bottleneck style, using a knife as a slide. His recordings were successful, but in 1927 he retired and went back to Louisville, where he lived until his death, on April 4, 1960, from carcinoma of the tongue (death certificate). A revival of interest in the recordings of many country blues artists occurred from the 1950s on, but Weaver died almost forgotten. A complete collection of his recordings was released on two CDs in 1992. In the same year his hitherto unmarked grave received a headstone by engagement of the Kentuckiana Blues Society, based in Louisville. Since 1989 the society has presented its Sylvester Weaver Award annually to honor those who have rendered outstanding services to blues music.

History The station signed on at 107.1 FM. In June 1988, WLOW began playing nostalgia/big band on 106.9 FM, one of the few FM stations to play this style of music. For much of 1994 the station became the home of local talk station WHHR-FM \\"The News and Conversation Station\\". The station was costly to operate and a strong opposition was formed against the loss of the nostalgia format, which had found a home on 99.7 FM. WLOW returned to standards in December, 1994. In 1995, Adventure Radio purchased the station and upgraded it to a class C1 station. WLOW traded frequencies with WIJY at 107.9. Over the years the music evolved into adult standards with some smooth jazz at night. The standards format continued through late 2005 as \\"WLOW 107.9 - Good Times, Great Memories\\" until October 2005. After playing Christmas music during the 2005 holiday season, WLOW rebranded itself and launched a new format, a more up-tempo Soft AC on the frequency as \\"Familiar Favorites - 107.9 The Coast\\". Although the new format was similar to the previous WLOW, it featured more recent material, from artists such as Frank Sinatra, The Bee Gees, The Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye, Gloria Estefan, and Fleetwood Mac. Smooth jazz was played at night. After stunting with an all Irish music format as \\"Shamrock 107.9\\" on St. Patrick's Day, WLOW flipped from Soft AC to Hot AC as Y107.9 - \\"90's, 2K, & Today!\\" on March 18, 2011. The call letters were also changed to WXYY. The new station was programmed by Brad Wells and in less than two years on 107.9 raised thousands of dollars for Susan G. Komen For The Cure Coastal Georgia and also collected over 4,000 for the area United States Marine Corps Toys for Tots Drive. On March 14, 2014 WXYY's call letters and format were moved to the stronger 100.1 signal as \\"Y100\\". 107.9's call letters were changed to WRWN, which stunted again with an all-Irish music format as \\"Shamrock 107.9\\". The stunting ended March 18, 2014 when WRWN launched a classic hits format branded as \\"Rewind 107.9\\".

Eberswind, the first abbot, is considered the compiler of the \\"Lex Baiuvariorum\\", the first code of law of the Bavarian people. The monastery brought great areas of Lower Bavaria into cultivation as far as the territory of the present Czech Republic, and founded 120 settlements in the Bavarian Forest. In the reigns of Charlemagne and Louis the German the abbey extended its possessions as far as the Wachau. Abbot Gozbald (825-855) was the latter's arch-chancellor. In 848 the monastery received the right of free election of its abbots, and in 857 became reichsunmittelbar (that is, free of all territorial lordship except that of the monarchy itself). By the end of the 9th century over 50 monks had become abbots in other monasteries or been appointed bishops. The 10th century however brought the turmoil of the Hungarian incursions, and between 950 and 990 the abbey was a collegiate foundation (Kollegiatstift). Under Abbot Gotthard or Godehard of Hildesheim (996-1022), better known as Saint Gotthard, the abbey entered a renewed golden age. Saint Gotthard, who along with Duke Henry of Bavaria, later Emperor Henry II, was a key supporter of contemporary monastic reform, was probably the abbey's best-known abbot. He later became Bishop of Hildesheim, where he was buried. The abbey was granted by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to the Bishop of Bamberg in 1152, and as a consequence lost its reichsunmittelbar status. In 1242 the Wittelsbachs inherited from the Counts of Bogen the office of Vogt (lord protector) of the abbey. Important abbots from this time on were Hermann (in office from 1242 to 1273), the author of the \\"Annales Hermanni\\", and the Reformation abbots Kilian Weybeck (1503 to 1534) and Paulus Gmainer (1550 to 1585). Vitus Bacheneder, abbot between 1651 and 1666, created after the Thirty Years' War the foundations of the economic prosperity of the abbey in the Baroque period. Under Abbot Joscio Hamberger (1700-1739) the creation of the Baroque abbey and church took place, as well as the construction of the school. The church was the first commission for the later famous Baroque architect Johann Michael Fischer, who worked on it from 1724-1726\\\\. Later history The abbey was dissolved at the secularisation of Bavaria in 1803. A fire in the church in 1813, caused by a bolt of lightning, signalled the beginning of the demolition of the Baroque complex. The monastery buildings were sold off to private individuals. The side chapels of the abbey church, the Gothic cloisters and adjoining buildings, as well as the parish church, were demolished. In 1918, with the help of a legacy from the theology professor Franz Xaver Knabenbauer, a native of Niederalteich, a monastery was re-established here and settled from Metten Abbey. In 1932 the monastery church received from the pope the title of \\"Basilica minor\\". In 1949, under Abbot Emmanuel Maria Heufelder, the monastery became once again an independent abbey. In 1946 the St.-Gotthard-Gymnasium (\\"St.-Gotthard-Grammar School\\") was refounded after having been closed by the Nazis. The remaining parts of the Baroque buildings were incorporated into new buildings in 1953-1954 and gradually renovated. In 1959 the Katholische Landvolkshochschule (\\"Catholic State Secondary School\\") was established here, and between 1971 and 1973 a new school building was erected for the St.-Gotthard-Gymnasium because the number of pupils had continually risen in the 1960s. Its boarding facilities, however, were shut down in 1994 and converted in 1999-2001 into the St. Pirmin Conference and Hospitality Centre. In 2006 and 2007 the school building of the St.-Gotthard-Gymnasium was refurbished. The school itself is now a Ganztagschule, which provides obligatory lessons from 7.45 a.m. until 4.00 p.m.. Niederaltaich Abbey has been a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation since its re-foundation in 1918. Image:Klosterkirche Niederaltaich 2.jpg Image:Klosterkirche Niederaltaich 5.jpg Image:Klosterkirche Niederaltaich 3.jpg Image:Klosterkirche Niederaltaich 4.jpg Ecumenism In 1924 Pope Pius XI gave the Benedictines the task of making the theology and spirituality of the east known in the west. Niederaltaich, as a consequence of these ecumenical goals, has since been a monastery of two ecclesasiatical traditions or rites, one part of the monks living and praying according to the Roman rite, the other part according to the Byzantine rite. The Eucharist and the Divine Office are celebrated by the monks in the German language in both rites, and in addition, liturgical texts from Church Slavonic and Greek have also been translated. In 1986 a church and a chapel, both dedicated to Bishop Nicholas of Myra (Saint Nicholas), were set up for the celebration of the Byzantine rite in the buildings of the former monastery brewery.

His color analyst is Jeff Gordon. Counting 2020, Joy has been part of the live broadcast of 41 Daytona 500s (7 for MRN Radio, 17 for CBS and 17 for FOX). He also serves as expert analyst for live TV coverage of collector car auctions. Biography=Early life and career Joy was born November 25, 1949 in Chicago, Illinois to M. Verne Joy and Jean Peters Joy, the oldest of their four children. He was raised in Windsor, Connecticut, and graduated from West Hartford, Connecticut's Conard High School. His career began as a public address announcer at Riverside Park Speedway in Agawam, Mass., in 1970 while attending the University of Hartford and later Emerson College. He added Thompson Speedway in 1972 and in 1975 began working at Stafford Motor Speedway in Connecticut, joining Jack Arute, Jr., the son of the track owner, establishing the track as a hotbed for announcers. Announcing five nights per week, he was noticed by Motor Racing Network (MRN) co-founder Ken Squier. MRN hired him as a freelancer in 1975, then full-time in late 1978, working weekdays in marketing for Daytona International Speedway. He rose to co- anchor, general manager and executive producer of MRN in January 1980. In 1981, he was the lead broadcaster for ESPN's first live NASCAR telecast in that November's Atlanta Journal 500 at Atlanta International Raceway. CBS Sports and The Nashville Network (1983‚Äì2000) In June 1983, Joy became a pit reporter for CBS' coverage, working with Ken Squier and Ned Jarrett. Since CBS didn't broadcast many races, he also continued to broadcast for MRN radio. Joy also launched The Nashville Network's NASCAR coverage in 1991, as lap-by-lap announcer, continuing through 1995, and also participated in live NASCAR coverage on TBS. When NASCAR went to Indy, Joy anchored the IMS Radio Network live coverage from the first Brickyard 400 in 1994 through 1998. Joy was one of the first announcers to embrace the Internet. In 1997, he encouraged Usenet and Jayski readers to e-mail TV coverage suggestions that he could present in a CBS seminar. A member of many Usenet newsgroups, he read them for preparation for broadcasts. In 1998, after 15 years on pit road, CBS Sports made Joy their lap-by-lap announcer with Ken Squier becoming the studio host, where the pair worked until the end of 2000, when CBS lost the rights to televise NASCAR racing. Joy's CBS career included most major forms of American motorsports for television: Formula One, CART, IRL, and drag racing, as well as coverage of college football, the Winter Olympics, the Sun Bowl, harness racing's Hambletonian, Pro Beach Volleyball and World Cup Skiing, plus NCAA championship events in soccer, gymnastics, swimming and diving, track and field, lacrosse, and wrestling. Fox Sports (1998‚Äìpresent) Mike joined Fox Sports in 1998 to become the lead announcer of Formula One coverage on Fox Sports Net, with Derek Bell as expert analyst. For the 2001 season, he moved full-time to Fox with the NASCAR TV package. Joy teamed with Hall of Fame driver Darrell Waltrip and former crew chief Larry McReynolds to form the network's broadcast team. The 2020 Daytona 500 is his 20th as lead TV race announcer, and the 44th Daytona Speedweeks in which he has been part of live broadcast coverage. In 2015, Joy, Waltrip, and McReynolds completed 15 years together, the longest tenure of any three-man announcing booth in US network sports television history. Beginning 2016, four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon joined Joy and Waltrip in the FOX-TV booth, with McReynolds moving to a new role as race strategist and rules analyst. On June 23, 2019, Waltrip retired from television.FOXSports PR Fox broadcasts the Daytona 500 and the first 16 NASCAR Cup races each season, plus two all-star events. Joy also anchors NASCAR Cup coverage on Fox-owned cable network Fox Sports 1 (FS1), formerly Speed. Four weeks every year, Joy brings his extensive knowledge of collector cars to the Barrett-Jackson auction block as lead analyst for the live TV auction coverage. His unscripted commentary mixes detailed knowledge of the cars and their specs with first-hand recall of how cars of the 1950s to 1970s were viewed back in their day. When the TV rights moved to Velocity/Discovery beginning 2015, Joy was the first talent Discovery hired to lead their broadcast team in the same role on loan from Fox. Beginning 2020, the Barrett-Jackson TV rights move to A&E; Networks' History channel, with Joy continuing in the lead expert role. In September 2008, Fox sent Joy to call a Minnesota Twins/Tampa Bay Rays Major League Baseball game, in which the Rays clinched their first-ever playoff appearance. Joy is very active on social media; his Twitter handle is @mikejoy500. He engages in many automotive web forums, from El Camino to MG to Ford GT, usually using the screen name \\"200mph\\". Honors Joy is a charter member of the prestigious NASCAR Hall of Fame Voting Panel, and in December 2013, was named sole media representative to the Hall's exclusive nominating process. Joy was voted the 2011 recipient of the Henry T McLemore Award. Presented since 1969, this award celebrates career excellence in motorsports journalism and is voted on by past winners. The International Motorsports Hall of Fame presents the Award at its annual induction ceremony, and the hall displays a wall of plaques honoring the winners. He is a member, and past vice-president of the National Motorsports Press Association. In March 2014, a Sporting News poll named Joy first among network television's 15 NASCAR announcers and analysts with a 93% approval rating. In 2019, Mike was named to the voting panel for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame. On November 10, 2019, Joy was inducted into the New England Auto Racers Hall of Fame. In 2000, Mike was inducted into the Riverside Park Speedway Hall of Fame.

Edison is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Edison primarily contracts with school districts on the basis of performance partnerships, alliances, and charter school establishment. In 2015, Edison managed schools enrolling 10,417 students on a vendor operated school basis. History The company was founded in 1992 as the Edison Project, largely the brainchild of Chris Whittle. The expansion of Edison included the involvement of Tom Ingram (campaign manager and chief of staff to Lamar Alexander, who was a former Governor of Tennessee and United States Secretary of Education 1991-1993), Benno C. Schmidt, Jr., John Chubb (political scientist from the Hoover and Brookings Institutions), and Chester E. Finn, Jr. (assistant secretary of education to former presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush). It was founded around the idea of school vouchers. Approach to education Edison claimed that it could run public schools for less money than school districts could, and that it would improve student achievement while making a profit for its shareholders. Edison attracted ideological support from backers of privatization and school vouchers, including The Wall Street Journal and the Hoover Institution. In 2008, the company announced the acquisition of the education software company Provost Systems, based in Santa Clara, California, which was renamed EdisonLearning. In 2013, the NAHT.(National Association of Head Teachers - a trade union and professional association representing more than 28,500 members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland), in partnership with EdisonLearningUK, developed the Aspire Pilot Programme for schools judged as Satisfactory or Requires Improvement by Ofsted. By 2014, EdisonLearning‚Äôs educational service offerings had moved well beyond the management of charter schools, to include virtual and blending learning, and dropout recovery and prevention centers. Throughout its history, EdisonLearning has provided educational services to 474 school partnerships in 32 states. Expansion and contraction Edison's stock was publicly traded on the NASDAQ for four years. The company reported only one profitable quarter while it was publicly traded. After reaching a high of close to USD$40 per share in early 2001, shares fell to 14 cents. Also in 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that Edison failed to disclose that as much as 41 percent of its revenue that year consisted of money that it never saw: $154 million. By 2002, Edison was courting Roger Milliken for a possible bailout. The company was eventually taken private in 2003, in a buyout facilitated by Liberty Partners on behalf of the Florida Retirement System, which handles pension investments for the state's public school teachers; The deal valued the company at $180 million or $1.76 per share. After losing many contracts,Cancelled Edison Contracts Edison diversified away from the management of public schools and into marketing conventional supplemental services such as testing, summer school and tutoring. Most of its new business involves providing such services rather than trying to manage schools. In 2008, the School District of Philadelphia, Edison's largest single client with 20 schools (Edison was originally planned to take over the entire district), later announced plans to dismiss the company as a manager, noting that it and other private firms would be eligible to reapply. By June 18 that year, Philadelphia's School Reform Commission voted to seize six schools from outside contractors‚Äî four of them run by Edison‚Äî citing lack of improvement. In 2011, former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson announced that he was partnering with EdisonLearning to set up dropout prevention and recovery centers for high school-age students who have already left school or are at risk of leaving and want to earn a standard high school diploma. The centers would be called \\"Magic Johnson Bridgescape Academies.\\" In 2014, Thom Jackson bought the company. Jackson serves as Chief Executive Officer and President at EdisonLearning, Inc. Jackson had served as Chief Operating and Legal Officer at EdisonLearning, Inc. Criticism Edison's educational and financial performance has been the subject of criticism. Despite initial promises of costs reductions, client districts reported higher costs for their Edison schools. Edison's claims about academic improvement failed to live up to the company's promises. A July 2002 New York Times analysis of Edison's claims found that the troubled Cleveland, Ohio, school system achieved higher gains than Edison's schools when analyzed with the methodology Edison applied to its own schools' achievement.Jacques Steinberg and Diana B. Henriques, Complex Calculations on Academics, The New York Times, July 16, 2002 In the period the failure of Edison Schools to revolutionize education became apparent, supporters of privatized education have criticized Whittle's for entering contracts with public school districts rather than setting up completely private schools.

Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Botanical history Nepenthes burbidgeae was discovered on Mount Kinabalu in 1858 by Hugh Low and Spenser St. John. St. John wrote the following account of finding the species near the Marai Parai plateau:St. John, S. 1862. Life in the Forests of the Far East; or, Travels in northern Borneo. 2 volumes. Smith, Elder & Co., London. > Crossing the Hobang, a steep climb led us to the western spur, along which > our path lay; here, at about 4000 ft [1200 m], Mr. Low found a beautiful > white and spotted pitcher-plant which he considered the prettiest of the > twenty-two species of Nepenthes with which he was then acquainted; the > pitchers are white and covered in a most beautiful manner with spots of an > irregular form, of a rosy pink colour. Frederick William Burbidge was one of the first to collect the plant in 1878, although he did not succeed in introducing it into cultivation. The type specimen of N. burbidgeae, Burbidge s.n., was collected on the Marai Parai plateau of Mount Kinabalu and is deposited at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes burbidgeae. Carnivorous Plant Database. A duplicate specimen is held at the New York Botanical Garden.Specimen Details: Nepenthes burbidgei Hook. f. ex Burb.. The New York Botanical Garden. Nepenthes burbidgeae appeared as an unnamed species in Burbidge's 1880 book The Gardens of the Sun.Burbidge, F.W. 1880. The Gardens of the Sun. Murray, London. Joseph Dalton Hooker named N. burbidgeae after Burbidge's wife, though the name only appeared in an unpublished manuscript. The specific epithet is attributed to Burbidge as he used it in a letter to The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1882. It reads: > Nepenthes Burbidgeae, Hook. f. MSS., is a lovely thing, as yet unintroduced > : pitchers pure white, semi-translucent like egg-shell, porcelain-white, > with crimson or blood-tinted blotches. Lid blotched and dotted with crimson- > purple. It is a very distinct plant, with triangular stems, 50 feet long, > and the margins of the leaves decurrent. In 1894, Otto Stapf identified specimens belonging to N. burbidgeae as N. phyllamphora, a taxon that is now considered synonymous with N. mirabilis. In two articles authored by Burbidge in 1894 and 1896,Burbidge, F.W. 1896. Nepenthes. The Gardeners' Chronicle 20(2): 105‚Äì106. the name of this species was written as N. burbidgei. This name is considered a sphalma typographicum (misprint) of N. burbidgeae, although it appeared in a number of other works by authors such as Odoardo Beccari (1886),Beccari, O. 1886. Rivista delle specie del genere Nepenthes. Malesia 3: 1‚Äì15. John Muirhead Macfarlane (1908),Macfarlane, J.M. 1908. Nepenthaceae. In: A. Engler.

Journal of the Straits branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, special number. pp. 281‚Äì295. Herbarium material also bears this spelling of the name. Seventy years after its discovery, N. burbidgeae remained a poorly known species. This is reflected in the writing of B. H. Danser in his seminal 1928 monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", where he suggests a close relative in N. pilosa:Danser, B.H. 1928. 7. Nepenthes Burbidgeae BURB.

Kinabalu and is very > insufficiently known. I have not ventured to unite it with any other. N. > pilosa, though doubtless the most nearly related species, is certainly > different. In 1981, Australian botanist Allen Lowrie reported that the fluid in unopened pitchers of N. burbidgeae is effective in stopping external bleeding. Lowrie cited two examples of researchers in the field successfully using this fluid on cuts and wounds.Lowrie, A. 1983. Sabah Nepenthes Expeditions 1982 & 1983\\\\. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 12(4): 88‚Äì95. Description Nepenthes burbidgeae is a strong climber that quickly enters the vining stage. The stem reaches 15 m in length and is up to 18 mm in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical to triangular in cross section and up to 12 cm long. A rosette plant with lower pitchers The leaves of this species are coriaceous and petiolate. The lamina or leaf blade is oblong in shape and up to 40 cm long by 10 cm wide. It has an acute apex and its base is typically abruptly attenuate. The petiole is winged, up to 15 cm long, and clasps the stem. It is often decurrent into two narrow wings that extend down the stem. Three to four longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are inconspicuous. Tendrils are up to 30 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers are rounded-infundibular or conical in shape. Unlike the pitchers of many other Nepenthes species, those of N. burbidgeae have no obvious constriction in the middle. The lower pitchers are relatively large, being up to 25 cm high by 10 cm wide. A pair of fringed wings, measuring up to 10 mm in width, runs down the front of each pitcher. The glandular region, which bears minute overarched glands, covers the basal half of the pitcher's inner surface. The pitcher mouth is round and elongated into a short neck at the rear. The peristome is flattened and expanded, measuring up to 30 mm in width. Its inner margin is lined with a series of small but distinct teeth. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 49% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate and up to 8 cm wide. It bears a distinct keel as well as a characteristic hooked appendage on its lower surface. An unbranched spur (‚â§12 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers Upper pitchers are similar to their terrestrial counterparts in most respects, even retaining the same colouration. However, they are smaller, reaching only 13 cm in height and 7 cm in width. They are infundibular in the basal third and globose above. In aerial pitchers, a pair of ribs is present in place of wings.Malouf, P. 1995. A visit to Kinabalu Park. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 24(4): 104‚Äì108. Nepenthes burbidgeae has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 25 cm long, while the rachis reaches 30 cm in length. Partial peduncles may be one- or two-flowered and are up to 15 mm long. Sepals are ovate and up to 5 mm long. Most parts of the plant are covered in a sparse indumentum of short hairs. The margins of the lamina are lined with brown hairs up to 3 mm long. Nepenthes burbidgeae has a very restricted range and exhibits relatively little variability. As such, no infraspecific taxa have been described. Ecology=Habitat and distribution Nepenthes burbidgeae is endemic to Kinabalu National Park, where it has a patchy distribution around Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon. Specifically, it has been recorded from the Marai Parai plateau, Mamut copper mine, and Pig Hill.Thong, J. 2006. Travels around North Borneo ‚Äì Part 1. Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Inc. 81: 12‚Äì17. On Pig Hill, it grows at 1900‚Äì1950 mAdam, J.H., C.C. Wilcock & M.D. Swaine 1992. The ecology and distribution of Bornean Nepenthes. Journal of Tropical Forest Science 5(1): 13‚Äì25. and is sympatric with N. rajah, N. tentaculata, and the natural hybrid N. √ó alisaputrana.Thong, J. 2006. Travels around North Borneo ‚Äì Part 2. Victorian Carnivorous Plant Society Inc. 82: 6‚Äì12. The altitudinal range of this species is often quoted as 1200‚Äì1800 m above sea level,McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. but some sources give a lower limit of 1100 m and upper limit of 2250 mCheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1‚Äì157. or even 2300 m. Mount Kinabalu was only formed around 1 million years ago and, during the last ice age (approximately 20,000 to 10,000 years ago), it had an ice cap on its summit. As such, it appears that N. burbidgeae is a relatively recent species in evolutionary terms.Risner, J.K. 1987. The Mystery of the Nepenthes, or Just How Did They Get There? Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 16(4): 115‚Äì118. Lower pitchers of N. burbidgeae growing in mossy forest Nepenthes burbidgeae is probably the rarest of the Nepenthes species native to Mount Kinabalu. Its typical habitat consists of mossy forest or montane forest, where it often grows in low scrub and exposed areas on the tops of steep ridges. The species is restricted to ultramafic soils.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. In more exposed areas, N. burbidgeae is often found climbing amongst bushes of Leptospermum javanicum. At some localities it has also been recorded from bamboo forest. Nepenthes burbidgeae can often be found growing amongst populations of N. edwardsiana, N. rajah, and N. tentaculata, and hybrids with all of these species have been recorded. Threats and conservation status The El Ni√±o climatic phenomenon of 1997 to 1998 had a catastrophic effect on the Nepenthes species of Mount Kinabalu. The dry period that followed severely depleted some natural populations. Forest fires broke out in 9 locations in Kinabalu Park, covering a total area of 25 square kilometres and generating large amounts of smog. Hugo Steiner recalls being struck by the scarcity of N. burbidgeae pitchers observed on Mount Kinabalu during a trip in 1999.Steiner, H. 2002. Borneo: Its Mountains and Lowlands with their Pitcher Plants. Toihaan Publishing Company, Kota Kinabalu. At the time of the El Ni√±o, many plants were temporarily transferred to the park nursery. These were later replanted in the \\"Nepenthes Garden\\" in Mesilau. Since then, Ansow Gunsalam has established a nursery close to the Mesilau Lodge at the base of Kinabalu Park to protect the endangered species of that area, including N. burbidgeae. The conservation status of N. burbidgeae is listed as Endangered on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species based on an assessment carried out in 2000. This does not agree with an informal assessment made by Charles Clarke in 1997, who classified the species as Vulnerable based on the IUCN criteria. However, Clarke noted that since all known populations of N. burbidgeae lie within the boundaries of Kinabalu National Park and are inaccessible to collectors, they \\"are unlikely to become threatened in the foreseeable future\\". Taking this into account, he suggested a revised assessment of Conservation Dependent. Related species Nepenthes burbidgeae is easily distinguished from other species in the genus on the basis of its pitcher shape and colouration, as well as the hook-shaped appendage on the underside of the lid.Clarke, C.M. 2001. A Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sabah. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The only other Bornean Nepenthes species with a similarly developed appendage are N. chaniana and N. pilosa.Clarke, C.M., C.C. Lee & S. McPherson 2006. Nepenthes chaniana (Nepenthaceae), a new species from north-western Borneo. Sabah Parks Journal 7: 53‚Äì66. B. H. Danser suggested that N. burbidgeae is most closely related to N. pilosa.Danser, B.H. 1935. Note on a few Nepenthes. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 13(3): 465‚Äì469. The latter species is poorly known and was for a long time confused with N. chaniana.[Anonymous] 2006. New pitcher plant species that went unnoticed . Daily Express, October 28, 2006. The glandular crest of N. chaniana is very similar to that of N. burbidgeae, particularly in upper pitchers. However, it is difficult to confuse these species as the pitchers are otherwise markedly different in structure; the upper pitchers of N. burbidgeae are short and funnel-shaped, whereas those of N. chaniana are elongated and have a dense indumentum of white hair. Natural hybrids Lower pitchers of N. burbidgeae √ó N. fusca Natural hybrids involving N. burbidgeae appear to be relatively rare and only four have been recorded to date. Three of these (crosses with N. edwardsiana, N. fusca, and N. tentaculata) have received little attention in the scientific literature, but N. burbidgeae √ó N. rajah has been described as N. √ó alisaputrana and is famous for producing huge pitchers rivalling those of N. rajah in size. N. burbidgeae √ó N. rajah Nepenthes √ó alisaputrana was described in 1992 by J. H. Adam and C. C. Wilcock and is named in honour of Datuk Lamri Ali, Director of Sabah Parks.Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1992. A new natural hybrid of Nepenthes from Mt. Kinabalu (Sabah). Reinwardtia 11: 35‚Äì40. It is only known from a few remote localities within Kinabalu National Park, where it grows in stunted, open vegetation over serpentine soils at around 2000 m above sea level, often amongst populations of N. burbidgeae. This plant is notable for combining the best characters of both parent species, not least the size of its pitchers, which rival those of N. rajah in volume (‚â§35 cm high, ‚â§20 cm wide). The other hybrids involving N. rajah do not exhibit such impressive proportions. The pitchers of N. √ó alisaputrana can be distinguished from those of N. burbidgeae by a broader peristome, larger lid and simply by their sheer size. The hybrid differs from its other parent, N. rajah, by its lid structure, indumentum of short, brown hairs, narrower and more cylindrical peristome, and pitcher colour, which is usually yellow-green with red or brown flecking. For this reason, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb gave it the common name \\"Leopard Pitcher-Plant\\". The peristome is green to dark red and striped with purple bands. Leaves are often slightly peltate. The hybrid is a strong climber and frequently produces upper pitchers. Nepenthes √ó alisaputrana more closely resembles N. rajah than N. burbidgeae, but it is difficult to confuse this plant with either. However, this mistake has previously been made on at least one occasion; a pitcher illustrated in Adrian Slack's Insect-Eating Plants and How to Grow Them as being N. rajahSlack, A. 1986.

The research was based on leaf material from nine dry herbarium specimens. Eight spots containing phenolic acids, flavonols, flavones, leucoanthocyanins and 'unknown flavonoid' 1 and 3 were identified from chromatographic profiles. The distributions of these in the hybrid N. √ó alisaputrana and its putative parental species N. burbidgeae and N. rajah are shown in the adjacent table. A specimen of N. √ó alisaputrana grown from tissue culture (in vitro) was also tested. Luteolin, cyanidin and 'Unknown Flavonoid 3' were undetected in N. burbidgeae, while concentrations of 'Unknown Flavonoid 1' were found to be weak. Chromatographic patterns of the N. √ó alisaputrana samples studied showed complementation of its putative parental species. Myricetin was found to be absent from all studied taxa.

Cultivation Little information has been published on the growing requirements of N. burbidgeae. In Insect-Eating Plants and How to Grow Them, Adrian Slack wrote that cuttings of N. burbidgeae were more difficult to root than those of other Nepenthes species.Marthaler, O. 1996. An addition to Adrian Slack's comment on Nepenthes burbidgeae (improbable) cuttings. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 25(3): 94‚Äì95.Marthaler, O. 1996. An addition to Adrian Slack's comments on Nepenthes burbidgeae cuttings. Bulletin of the Australian Carnivorous Plant Society, Inc. 15(1): 8‚Äì9. In 2004, professional horticulturist Robert Sacilotto published a summary of measured tolerances of highland Nepenthes species, based on experiments conducted between 1996 and 2001.Sacilotto, R. 2004. Experiments with highland Nepenthes seedlings: A Summary of Measured Tolerances. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 33(1): 26‚Äì31. Nepenthes burbidgeae was found to be tolerant of a fairly wide range of conditions, particularly in terms of temperature and soil composition; it grew in every substrate used in the experiment. However, plants showed stunted growth when grown in a mixture consisting of 50% silica gel, 20% Sphagnum moss, 20% fir bark, and 10% peat moss chunks. The highest growth rates were exhibited by specimens in 50% leached perlite, 30% long fiber Sphagnum moss, 10% peat moss chunks, and 10% fir bark, as well as media without fir bark and with a higher percentage of Sphagnum. Nepenthes burbidgeae was found to tolerate temperatures in the range of 9 to 41 ¬∞C (48¬∞ to 105 ¬∞F). A nighttime drop in temperature below 18 ¬∞C (65 ¬∞F) was necessary for good growth; plants that were not exposed to such a drop grew around 50% slower and produced fewer pitchers. Optimal growth rates were observed with daytime temperatures of 20 to 29 ¬∞C (68¬∞ to 85 ¬∞F) and nighttime temperatures of 12 to 16 ¬∞C (54¬∞ to 60 ¬∞F). Soil with a pH of 4.8 to 5.5 produced the best results; values below 3.5 corresponded with slower growth. Optimal soil conductivity was between 10 and 24 microsiemens, and prolonged exposure of one week or more to levels of more than 60 microsiemens resulted in foliar burn. The experiments suggested that N. burbidgeae grows best when relative humidity is in the range of 68 to 95%. However, constant exposure to high humidity in excess of 90% resulted in disease outbreaks and increased plant death rates. Seedlings of less than one year proved to be particularly vulnerable to this. Optimal light levels varied depending on the light source used: 8100‚Äì11000 lx (750‚Äì1000 fc) in sunlight, 7000‚Äì9700 lx (650‚Äì900 fc) under high pressure sodium lamps, 6500‚Äì9100 lx (600‚Äì850 fc) under metal halide lamps, and 5400‚Äì7300 lx (500‚Äì680 fc) under fluorescent lamps. Nepenthes burbidgeae could be grown in lower light conditions, but such plants exhibited etiolated growth and reduced colouration. The species was found to respond well to a fertilizer that was applied to the pitchers on a monthly basis, but a foliar feed using the same solution produced no visible change in growth rate. Notes :a.The Latin description of N. burbidgeae from Danser's monograph reads: > Folia mediocria petiolata, lamina elliptica, nervis longitudinalibus > utrinque 3-4, vagina in alas 2 decurrente: ascidia rosularum et inferiora > ignota ; ascidia superiora infundibuliformia, parte inferiore costis 2 > prominentibus, os versus alis 2 fimbriatis ; peristomio operculum versus in > collum ; 1-2 cm altum elevato, cylindrico, crebre costato, operculo late > cordato, facie inferiore prope basin carina valida ; inflorescentia ignota ; > indumentum in omnibus partibus iuventute pubescens, statu adulto parcum v. > deciduum, in margine foliorum persistens.

Some versions have it that, when startled, the bird will take off and fly around in ever-decreasing circles until it manages to fly up its own backside, disappearing completely, which adds to its rarity. Other sources state that the bird flies backwards so that it can admire its own beautiful tail feathers, or because while it does not know where it is going, it likes to know where it has been. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as \\"[a] mythical bird displaying ridiculous behaviour\\" and speculates that the word could have been suggested by the word ouzel, meaning a blackbird (Turdus merula). The earliest citation recorded by the dictionary dates from 1858.oozlum, n. Oxford English Dictionary. Third edition, June 2004. A variant of the oozlum, possibly a mutation, is the weejy weejy bird, which has only one wing which causes it to fly in tighter, faster, smaller circles, until it disappears up its own fundament.

The oozlefinch has been adopted as the unofficial mascot of the United States Air Defense Artillery. The oozlum bird was the subject of the 1970 British film Carry On Up the Jungle. There was also a recurring joke in an episode of the BBC radio comedy, The Navy Lark\\"NANA\\", series 15, episode 2, on 16 November 1975. that Lt Commander Murray (Stephen Murray) did not know what the oozlum bird was. Sub Lieutenant Phillips (Leslie Phillips) suggested that when young, oozlum birds fly straight, and it is only when they turn left that the trouble starts. The oozlum bird is sometimes used as a symbol of self-reference and circular argumentation. For example, author Charles Seife wrote: \\"Like the mythical oozlum bird, Wikipedia seems to have the ability to fly around in ever decreasing circles until it flies right up its own rectum.\\"Garner, Dwight. \\"In 'Virtual Unreality', Charles Seife Unfriends Gullibility.\\" The New York Times, July 1, 2014. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/books/in-virtual-unreality- charles-seife-unfriends-gullibility.html?_r=0 The fabulous qualities of the oozlum bird are the subject of a poem by W.

In 1948 he met Christian theologian Francis Schaeffer and became a member of L'Abri in Switzerland. Hans and his wife Anky opened a Dutch branch of L'Abri in 1971. Following a doctorate in art history with a dissertation on Gauguin at the University of Amsterdam, he became the founder of the art history department at the Free University in Amsterdam. Rookmaaker combined his academic career with a prolific role of addressing ambiguity about art among Christians and ambiguity about faith among artists. His main thesis was laid out in his 1970 publication entitled Modern Art and The Death of a Culture. Throughout his career, he lectured in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, as well as in his native Netherlands. Two books by Rookmaaker were published posthumously: Art Needs No Justification in 1978 and The Creative Gift : Essays on Art and the Christian Life in 1981. In 2003 The Complete Works of Hans Rookmaaker, edited by his daughter Marleen Hengelaar-Rookmaaker, were published.  Childhood and youth  Born in The Hague, Netherlands Hans was the last born in a non-Christian family of colonizers. His grandmother was half-Indonesian. He was largely raised in Indonesia, but returned to Holland to join the Royal Netherlands Navy. Already as a teenager he had begun what would become an extensive collection of African-American music. As a junior officer, he began to study ship construction at Delft University prior to the start of World War II. There, prior to the war, Rookmaaker met and became engaged to Riki Spetter, who was Jewish.  Conversion to Christianity  As Rookmaaker was a naval officer, he was interned as a prisoner of war in Stanislau, now Ukraine and later on in Neubrandenburg in northern Germany. In Stanislau he met the Christian philosopher J.P.A. Mekkes who would have a lasting impact on his life. He returned home as a Christian, but was severely tested as his bride- to-be was nowhere to be found. His study of the Old Testament, dedicated to her during the camp years, never reached her. It has been established that Sophia Henri√´tte Spetter died in Auschwitz on September 30, 1942. Rookmaaker changed his career and took up a doctoral study in art history. In 1948, through his fianc√© and bride-to-be Anky Huitker, he met Francis Schaeffer. This was the beginning of a lifelong friendship with a very fruitful exchange of ideas. Rookmaaker had a dominant influence on Schaeffer's ideas on art and culture and also introduced Schaeffer to Reformational philosophy. Rookmaaker's famous saying \\"Jesus didn't come to make us Christian. Jesus came to make us fully human\\" formed the central theme of Dick Staub's 2010 book About You.  Career  Rookmaaker stood in the tradition of Neo-Calvinism, developed in the late 19th century. The essential feature of this philosophy is the treatment of all of life as God's creation. There is no neutrality, while secularism is just another religion. Rookmaaker ventured to apply this basic viewpoint to culture. With his expert ear of black music, multi-cultural roots and after a profound change of direction, he devoted his PhD to the ideas of Paul Gauguin and how they influenced his paintings. He also was an art critic for the Dutch Christian newspaper Trouw. He edited a 12-part Fontana Records series of black music, wrote a book on this subject and developed a Christian approach to art in a book aiming at a wide audience. On the political level he wrote about art and culture for the magazine of the Reformed ARP party. By the mid '60's he was invited to start the department of art history at the Free University. His broad international perspective brought a large number of foreign students to the department at a time when this was still far from usual. From 1955 onwards he frequently visited his friend Francis Schaeffer to lecture at the Swiss l‚ÄôAbri community in Hu√©moz. He took Schaeffer on a tour to address Dutch audiences and started l'Abri meetings for university students in his Amsterdam home. He visited North America where he met his hero Mahalia Jackson. More and more Rookmaaker focused his career on motivating Christian believers to take culture seriously and live a life that integrates conviction and deeds. Traces of his influence are still to be found in many places, while the present awakening of Evangelicals to the arts proves Rookmaaker's prophetic stand. Rookmaaker died suddenly on a Sunday in March 1977. Further reading * Gasque, L.: Art and the Christian Mind: The Life and Work of H. R. Rookmaaker, Crossway Books 2005. .

Brown earths are mostly located between 35¬∞ and 55¬∞ north of the Equator. The largest expanses cover western and central Europe, large areas of western and trans-Uralian Russia, the east coast of America and eastern Asia. Here, areas of brown earth soil types are found particularly in Japan, Korea, China, eastern Australia and New Zealand. Brown earths cover 45% of the land in England and Wales. They are common in lowland areas (below 1,000 feet) on permeable parent material. The most common vegetation types are deciduous woodland and grassland. Due to the reasonable natural fertility of brown earths, large tracts of deciduous woodland have been cut down and the land is now used for farming. They are normally located in regions with a humid temperate climate. Rainfall totals are moderate, usually below 76 cm per year, and temperatures range from 4 ¬∞C in the winter to 18 ¬∞C in the summer. They are well-drained fertile soils with a pH of between 5.0 and 6.5. Horizontal structure They generally have three horizons: the A, B and C horizon. Horizon A is usually a brownish colour, and over 20 cm in depth. It is composed of mull humus (well decomposed alkaline organic matter) and mineral matter. It is biologically active with many soil organisms and plant roots mixing the mull humus with mineral particles. As a result, the boundary between the A and B horizons can be ill-defined in unploughed examples. Horizon B is mostly composed of mineral matter which has been weathered from the parent material, but it often contains inclusions of more organic material carried in by organisms, especially earthworms. It is lighter in colour than the A horizon, and is often weakly illuviated (leached). Due to limited leaching only the more soluble bases are moved down through the profile. Horizon C is made up of the parent material, which is generally permeable and non- or slightly acidic, for example clay loam. General relations in western Europe Brown Earths are important, because they are permeable and usually easy to work throughout the year, so they are valued for agriculture. They also support a much wider range of forest trees than can be found on wetter land. They are freely drained soils with well- developed A and B horizons. They often develop over relatively permeable bedrock of some kind, but are also found over unconsolidated parent materials like river gravels. Some soil classifications include well-drained alluvial soils in the brown earths too. Typically the Brown Earths have dark brown topsoils with loamy particle size-classes and good structure ‚Äì especially under grassland. The B horizon lacks the grey colours and mottles characteristic of gley soils. The rich colour is the result of iron compounds, mainly complex oxides which, like rust, have a reddish-brown colour. Some of these soils are, in fact, red. For example, in the UK reddish brown earths occur on the Old Red Sandstone (Devonian) and the New Red Sandstone (Permian), and are red because the rocks from which they formed are derived from strongly oxidised deposits that were laid down under desert conditions millions of years ago. In long-cultivated soils the pH in the topsoil tends to be higher (more alkaline) than in the subsoil as a result of the addition of lime over the years. In general, the wetter the climate, the more acidic the soils. This is because rain tends to wash the ‚Äúalkaline‚Äù bases out of the soil. Of course, the parent material also has an effect, and hard acidic rocks give rise to more acidic soils than do the softer sandstones. The landscapes where these lowland soils occur are typically undulating, and interesting variations in the profiles relate to the slopes where they are found. We think, perhaps of soils as static and unchanging, but in fact they are never stationary. The processes of weathering and plant growth that were responsible for the formation of soils from bare parent materials in the first place are still going on. This is most easily seen on a hill slope. The top of the hill is usually convex, and it is here that most erosion is taking place ‚Äì upper slopes and summits are more exposed to wind, and rain, and gravity is slowly but surely moving the topsoil down the hill. Thus soils on the brow of the hill tend to be shallower than those in mid-slope positions, where soil is moving down, but being replaced by material from above. At the base of the slope we usually find a concave area where the eroded soil has accumulated. Here the topsoils will be significantly thicker than elsewhere. Soil formation factors A brown earth soil is affected by several different factors. These include: climate, relief, soil drainage, parent material and the soil biota that live in the soil itself. Classification Brown earths have a long history of being a major grouping in most soil classifications. In France they have been included with \\"sol brun acide\\", although these soils may tend to have more iron and aluminium in the B horizon, and tend to what, in the British classification, is called a brown podzolic soil. Brown earths are also classified in the German and Austrian soil taxonomy as \\"Braunerde.\\" Braunerden are widespread and frequently occur on unconsolidated parent sand or loess parent materials. \\"Parabraunerde\\" is the classification for a brown earth with an eluvial horizon above a slightly argillic, clayey illuvial horizon. This gives rise to a universal division of these, generally brown and well drained soils into the weakly leached brown earths - called cambisols in the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB); and more leached brown podzolic soils in which there is an orange-brown B horizon, but no pale leached horizon between the A and the B horizons. These are called Umbrisols in the WRB, and are particularly common in western Europe, covering large areas in NW Spain. Further east in Europe, in more continental climates, the soils show greater leaching of clay and other minerals, and are mapped as luvisols in the WRB. These are rather similar to brown earths, and some other classifications, including the British and French, call these soils argillic brown earths (sol brun lessive), because they have an argillic, i.e. clay- enriched horizon at some depth well below the A horizon. The argillic character is rather weakly expressed in the oceanic climate of the UK, and the differences between brown earths proper (cambic brown earths) and argillic yellow earths are not apparent to the general observer.

The layout was probably oval in shape and size, on the line still marked by the Circus. The original design and layout is unknown. It was rebuilt in stone in 1087. The castle was reputedly destroyed in a flood in 1236. In the 15th century, repairs were becoming too much for the ageing structure, and a new building was started in 1478 under John Morton, Bishop of Ely (later Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of England). His successor, John Alcock, extended and completed the re-building and died in the Castle in 1500. Subsequent bishops also spent considerable sums on this new palace. The Bishop's Palace was built of brick with dressings of Ketton Stone, but its exact location is unknown. In later Tudor times, the rebuilt castle became a notorious prison. The site was again redeveloped in the mid-17th century and yet again in 1816 by Joseph Medworth. A 1794 plan of the 'castle' exists; this only shows the 'castle' as it existed at the end of the 18th century, prior to the development of the site to its current form. The current building known as 'The Castle' was given Grade II* listed status on 31 October 1983 and the vaults Grade II listed in 1969. History=Medieval period The Doomsday Book makes no mention of a castle at Wisbech. King John travelled from Lynn to Lincolnshire via Wisbech, and stayed at the castle on 12 October 1216.His baggage train is reported to have got into difficulties crossing a river or estuary and the wagons and contents, including the regalia and other treasures, were lost. In recent years, treasure seekers have tried to find the location of this incident and the lost treasures. The castle and town of Wisbech were swept away in a storm in 1236, although the castle appears to have soon been rebuilt as a keeper or Constable is named in 1246. In 1297, John de Drommon, a prisoner, was released to serve King Edward I against the French. King Edward visited the castle in 1292, 1298, 1300 and 1305. In 1315, Richard Lambert of Lenne (Lynn), a merchant, brought an action against William le Blowere and others for a conspiracy to imprison him. He had been \\"thrown in the depth of the gaol of Wysebech among thieves, where by [sic] toads and other venomous vermin he was so inhumanely gnawed that his life was despaired of\\". The castle tower was repaired during 1332‚Äì1333 using six fotmel (approximately 420 lb) of lead, and a year later the bakehouse wall was buttressed using 6,000 bricks. In 1348, a gallows was erected in Gallow Marsh. In 1350, John de Walton was lodged in the castle accused of trespass and rebellion. There were several fisheries belonging to the manor of Wisbech alone, in the 1350s the reeves of Walton and Leverington each sent a porpoise to Wisbech Castle, and the reeve of Terrington a swordfish. In 1355, a licence was issued to John Boton, vicar of Wysebeche, to marry Hugh Lovet of Lincoln, the bishop's domicellus, and Jane de Pateshalle in the chapel of the Castle of Wysebech. The Constable's dwelling was a hall, which was newly built of free- stone, in 1404, near the gates of the Castle, and the chambers at the ends of the same, and upon the gates. The drawbridge (le Draughtbrigg) is mentioned and the moat around the 'Julie' was scoured out. In 1409, a new Floud Gate and a new water gate were erected and a new pons tractabilis(Bridge) towards the church. In 1410 a new 'Pons tractabilis' towards the church, a chapel within and a bridge without the castle, also a garden and dove house (destroyed in 1531) all walled around and moated. In 1410 Sir John Colvile was the governor or Constable, a steel seal used by him has a representation of a castle in the form of a fortress, with circular keep. A wax copy may be seen in Wisbech & Fenland Museum. In 1414, prisoners taken by the Earl of Dorchester were kept here. In 1443, the houses and chambers called Le Dungeon are allotted to the Constable. In 1473 Simon Oldmedow, of Lynn was the plaintiff in a case against the constable of Wisbech castle and the bailiffs of Wisbech. The complaint that he was being imprisoned at the instance of Thomas Goche, Edmund Pepyr and John Richeman, Corpus cum cause. The record is held at the UK National Archives at Kew. In 1476, the prison was repaired. During 1478‚Äì83, the Bishop's Palace was constructed of bricks measuring 11 inches in length and 2.5 inches thick with a dressing of Ketton stone. The property's cellars and foundations can still be seen. The palace was extended by Bishop Alcock. In 1513, the dovecote was completely destroyed. In 1515, a prisoner George Carman, saddler was the plaintiff in a case against the gaoler of the bishop's of Ely's prison in Wisbech Castle. He was being continually imprisoned in defiance of a writ of Corpus cum cause and subpoena, the record is kept at the National Archives, Kew. 16th century During the reign of Queen Mary (1553‚Äì1558) Protestants were imprisoned here during her restoration of Roman Catholicism. William Wolsey and Robert Piggott were imprisoned but then removed and later burnt at the stake. Queen Elizabeth I passed into law the Act of Uniformity 1558. In 1572, the Privy Council asked the bishop to report on the suitability of the castle for holding papists. In 1577 Cecilia Samuel was tried, convicted and hanged in Ely for drowning her newborn son in the ditch called the Castell dike in Wisbech. In 1580 the bishop was enjoined to put the castle \\"in order and strength\\" to receive prisoners, and the first were received in October. In October 1580 Roger Goad, Dr Bridgewater and William Fulke engaged in the examination of John Bourne, a glover and some others of the Family of Love who were confined in the castle. In 1583 a prisoner, Dr Andrew Oxenbridge, is recorded as taking the oath of supremacy. In 1584 it was suggested that the number of prisoners be limited to twenty. In 1584 John Feckenham (aka John Howman) died in the castle. Imprisoned in the Tower of London during the reign of Edward VI, he was made Abbott of Westminister by Mary Tudor but sent back to the Tower by Elizabeth I. While a prisoner in Wisbech he is said to have paid for a market cross to be erected. Later it was changed to an obelisk, but it was removed in April 1811. During the reign of Elizabeth I while the seat of the bishopric was left vacant, the Queen's halmote court to dealt with cases such as the surrender (transfer) of land at 'Stowecroft', 'Sybbilsholme', 'Harecrofte' by Jacomina Robinson to her son John Crosse in July 1586. In the last years of the 16th century there were 33 Catholics held prisoner in Wisbech Castle, almost all of them priests, including the Jesuit priests, Christopher Holywood, William Weston and lay brother Thomas Pounde. A quarrel arose among them that came to be known as the \\"Wisbech Stirs\\". In the winter of 1594-95 a substantial group (18 of the 33) wished to separate themselves from the rest and adopt a regular communal life. This was largely impossible without appearing to castigate those who did not want to make this change and on account of the limited space. The unwilling minority argued, which only confirmed the others in their resolve, and the separation was carried out in February 1595, but came to an end with a general reconciliation in November of that same year. Philip Strangeways was one of the missionary priests imprisoned at Wisbech at the end of Elizabeth's reign. cites Misc. (Cath. Rec. Soc.), i, 110; ii, 278, &c.; Other leading Roman Catholics were imprisoned for political reasons, at the time of the Spanish Armada; Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham may have also been held at Wisbech. Later they were principal conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot. Dr Francis Young's research indicates that there were at least 111 prisoners. 17th century John and Robert Nutter were brothers, born in Burnley. After university, both studied at the English College in Rheims before being ordained. Soon after returning to England to minister to recusant communities, they were captured and sent to the Tower of London. Robert was tortured before being forced to see his brother being hanged, drawn and quartered. Robert was eventually released and transported to France, but recaptured on his return to England and sent to Newgate, the Marshalsea and thence to Wisbech Castle. After escaping from the castle and recapture, he was martyred at Lancaster in July 1600. A fellow prisoner in Wisbech Castle was Dr. Antony Champney. William Chester was Constable from 1605 until his death in the castle in 1608; he was buried in St Peter's churchyard. There is a memorial to Matthias Taylor, Constable of the Castle in St Peter's Church. During his tenure three Jesuits escaped in 1614 and in 1615 another five escaped custody. His monument states that three sons, five daughters and 22 grandchildren survived him. In 1616 a priest, Thomas Tunstal, escaped from the castle to Norfolk. Sir Hamon L'Estrange had him pursued and apprehended. He was tried at Norwich and condemned and executed. The use of the castle for recusant prisoners ceased in 1627. During the English Civil War, after Oliver Cromwell had been appointed governor of the Isle of Ely for his activity in swaying it to the interest of Parliament, he refortified the castle and town with outposts at the Horseshoe Sluice and Leverington. The soldiers stationed to defend the town were commanded by Colonel Sir John Palgrave and Captain William Dodson; and the ammunition, and other warlike stores, were supplied from a Dutch ship, which the Queen had dispatched from Holland for the use of the Royalists, but which had been captured. In 1643 the castle was used to secure the river Nene frontier and to block any attempt by the Newark garrison to relieve the besieged King's Lynn Royalists. The castle was armed with cannon 'Great Guns' from Ely and money from the town paid for ironwork to repair the drawbridge. The garrison at Wisbech was commanded by Lt Col Dodson and carried out skirmishing in the surrounding Fenland. The naval blockade, siege and bombardment brought capitulation from King's Lynn after three weeks. Peterborough was occupied by the Parliamentarians before the capture of Crowland. Sir John Palgrave commanded a Norfolk regiment at this time stationed at Wisbech. His second-in-command was Sir Edward Askey. In July Torrell Jocelyn wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons expressing the concerns of the town's residents about the behaviour of their men, and his hope that the recently arrived regiment led by Sir John Holland would do better. Captain Thomas Pigge of Walsoken was taken prisoner by the Earl of Essex in October 1634 and exchanged at Burghley House 'on a bond of ¬£2,000 never to bear arms again'. John Thurloe esq,(Secretary of State) of Lincoln's Inn, Middlesex purchased the manors of Wisbech Barton, Elm and Todd St.Giles and the 'castle estate', sold off some property, demolished the bishop's palace, and then built and furnished a mansion, aka Thurloe's mansion (demolished by Joseph Medworth c1816), just before the Restoration of the Monarchy, after which his house and estates in Wisbech were repossessed by the Bishop of Ely. Jonas Moore's Mapp of the Great Levell of the Fens (1658) shows the town with a church and a large building surrounded by a moat, Thurloe's coat of arms is one of those nearby. William Dugdale noted that a lock at the Horseshoe (on the River Nene) erected in an earlier phase of the drainage work, which cost 'cost ¬£7000 at least' had since been 'pulled down, as useless, and is disposed of to Mr. Secretary Thurloe, towards his building of that fair new house in Wisbech, which stands where the old Castle was'. He also built a property (or properties) nearby for his sons. In 1664 Matthew, Lord Bishop of Ely was liable for 24 hearths, in 1662 it had been 25, one later being pulled down. Henry Pierson (died 1664), born in Wisbech was the first post-Restoration tenant to lease the castle from the Bishop of Ely. The Southwell family were tenants for over 100 years. 18th century The household goods of Mrs Edwards were auctioned at the castle on 8 July 1724. 'Notice To be SOLD, A Very good Milch Ass, with a She-foal a Fortnight old. Enquire at the Castle in Wisbeach', was advertised in the Stamford Mercury on 7 July 1737. In 1778/1779, the Italian author and poet Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti (1718‚Äì1789) resided with Edward Southwell and his family living at the Castle for about a fortnight. Afterwards, he published a series of letters Lettere Familiari de Giuseppe Baretti including a description of his Wisbech visit, including attending the race meet and a theatre performance. > To be sold by auction At the New Theatre (now the Angles Theatre) in > Deadman's Lane, in Wisbech on Tuesday the eighth of November, 1791, and the > following days. On the death of Edward Southwell, All the elegant and > genuine HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE, LINEN, and CHINA, brought from the Castle (his > late Dwelling-House) in Wisbech, a sale not being permitted on the Premises. An Act of 1793, 33 Geo.III c.53, empowered the Bishop of Ely to sell the castle. James Lord, bishop of Ely put up the castle for auction in six lots at the Rainbow coffee house, Cornhill, London on 13 November 1793. Joseph Medworth was the highest bidder for all six lots, totalling ¬£2,305. 19th century Joseph Medworth was elected Town Bailiff in 1809. William Richards, in his history of Lynn Vol I published in 1812, describes the castle site. \\"The detached (castle) buildings have been removed and some elegant rows of houses have been erected.The plan of a large Circus has already also been laid out, about one half which has already been built: when the plan is completed it will add greatly to the pleasantness and beauty of the town. The Castle is still standing, and likely to stand, with what may be called fair play, as long as any of the new buildings, although it has been built now over 150 years, and was, at the time of the sale, stated (even by his lordship, it seems) to be in a decayed and ruinous condition\\". In January 1814 the castle was temporarily used by the Seminary for Young ladies run by Miss Diggle and Miss Oldham whilst their property in The Crescent was completed. The present Regency villa formed the centre of a major redevelopment of the area in 1816; thus the site has been continuously inhabited for nearly a thousand years. The Castle owner Joseph Medworth died on 17 October 1827. The Rev.W.Holmes ran a Boarding School at the castle for young gentlemen from about 1830 until the 1840s. By 1842 F. Ewen's name also featured in the adverts. By 1884 the school was advertised as a Boarding and Day School of Rev.W.Holmes & Son. Charles Boucher of the Castle is reported to have broken his arm. On Friday, 30 October 1846 the Lincolnshire Chronicle paper reports ‚ÄòBirths‚Äô -‚ÄòAt the Castle Wisbech on the 15th inst., the lady of Charles Boucher. jun., Esq., of a son On Friday 24 March 1854 after the death of the tenant C. Boucher the executors (Bridgman, Pope & Baxter) of Joseph Medworth advertised in The Lincoln, Rutland and Stamford Mercury for a tenant for the castle, coach house and stables. In March 1864 the castle was sold at a public auction for ¬£1,300 to William Peckover FSA and later passed down the family. The will of Chas. Boucher, Esq.,(died December 1865 aged 82)of Wisbech, father of the late Charles Boucher was reported in the press on 10 August 1866. Mr FW Bradley of the Castle married Miss May Langley, youngest daughter of Mr J Langley, of Primrose Farm Tilney at Tilney All Saints on Wednesday, 11 September 1889. 20th century At the turn of the century The Castle tenant was still the dentist F W Bradley. The Northern Whig No 28,517 reported on Tuesday 2 January 1900 \\"Births\\" - \\"Bradley December 31, at Wisbech Castle, Cambs, the wife of F.W.Bradley, of a daughter.\\" On 16 May 1903 a chimney fire set the roof on fire at the castle. It took 12 hours to extinguish. In the 1920s the lawn was laid out as a lawn tennis court. He remained in occupation as a tenant of Lord Peckover for 48 years until 1935. At this time there was still a statue of Mercury (from the garden of Thurloe‚Äôs Castle) above the vaults in the garden. . In 1955 excavations on the site of Messrs. Keightley's new building in the Market Place revealed evidence of a wall and extensive moat, in which were found pottery, leather sole shoes, slim fitting with long pointed toes and an early 15th century gilt spur. Mrs F C D Fendick bought the property in 1957. Her husband Tee Gordon Fendick, M.A. LL.B. Wrote an article 'Wisbech castle: Past and Present' published in 1960 in it, he refers to the building's secrets, including a bricked up space between two rooms. After his death in the 1960s, she transferred ownership to Isle of Ely County Council in March 1969. After a merger this became the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council, then later Cambridgeshire County Council. The Castle features in the novels and short stories of John Gordon and other writers and poets. The Castle is currently (2020) the base for the 'Wisbech Words' and 'Wisbech Stanza' poetry and literary events. The castle was to be used as an educational museum for schools. A concealed fire escape was installed. The Fendick Room, previously the drawing room was to be used for meetings of a cultural and educational nature (maximum capacity - 30 persons). George Anniss lived on site in the 1970s and carried out research leading to the publication of A History of Wisbech Castle. The Castle was used as a Professional Development Centre, providing a venue for meetings and training. 21st century The castle has been used as a location for television and film drama. Following the BBC's 1999 David Copperfield Atlantic Films, 2008 Dean Spanley both used the building and the Crescent for parts of their productions. In September 2009, excavations were carried out on the site by Oxford Archaeology East and local volunteers.The report was published in July 2010. The Wisbech Castle Community Archaeology Project was 'Highly Commended' in the Best Community Archaeology Project category at the 2010 British Archaeological Awards. As a result of the dig, local volunteers formed a local archaeology group ‚Äì the Wisbech and District Archaeology Society (WADAS) - now FenArch (Fenland Archaeological Society). It was registered as an asset of community value. In February 2018, Wisbech Town Council acquired a lease from Cambridgeshire County Council and took over the running of the site. The castle project is run by a Castle Management committee of Wisbech Town council and a Castle Working Party of councillors and volunteers. In November 2019 an open day was held at the castle to mark the 10th anniversaries of the 2009 dig and the formation of Fenland Archaeological Society (FenArch). The finds from the 2009 dig, now held by Wisbech & Fenland Museum, were loaned for the exhibition. There have been school visits, and the property is licensed for civil weddings.

It runs a distance of 1,395 meters, from the Place Valhubert at the pont d'Austerlitz, by the gare d'Austerlitz, rising in a gentle slope towards its end at the place d'Italie - the town hall of the arrondissement being located at their intersection. Along the way, it serves the Jardin des Plantes and the H√¥pital de la Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re from which it derives its name. In front of the hospital stands a statue of doctor Philippe Pinel. The boulevard is an important traffic axis. Bordered by public and teaching establishments such as the general police station of the arrondissement, it has relatively little commercial and leisure activity excepting the shops and restaurants close to the gare d'Austerlitz. The boulevard is also home to the Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech main campus. This engineering graduate school built its facilities in 1910, at this time it was called ENSAM. Nowadays, more than 950 graduate students are attending courses in fields such as industrial or mechanical engineering. The m√©tro Line 5 runs through the Austerlitz viaduct, along the boulevard which has four stations: * Gare d'Austerlitz (at its northmost end) * Saint-Marcel (opposite H√¥pital de la Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re) * Campo Formio * Place d'Italie (at its southmost end) History \\"Le boulevard de l'H√¥pital et l'h√¥pital de la Salp√™tri√®re √† Paris\\"; by Christophe Civeton The boulevard is one of the Boulevards du midi of Louis XIV, constructed to supplement the band of boulevards already completed on the right bank of the Seine. However, the work advanced very slowly and the boulevard only finally opened in 1760. It was then the start of the road to Fontainebleau, which followed the course of the present avenue d'Italie. In the projects for the restoration of Paris in the post-war period (the 1959 town-planning directive), it was intended that the boulevard de l'H√¥pital be integrated into an expressway crossing Paris from south to north, which would have joined the Boulevard Richard- Lenoir on the right bank. However, this plan was never implemented, so the layout of the boulevard has scarcely changed from the original.

History The Guianan guilder replaced the Dutch guilder at par after the colonies were captured by the British from the Dutch. The guilder was initially subdivided into 20 Stuivers, in English stivers. Brazilian pecas (6,400 r√©is gold coins), known locally as joes, circulated at a value of 22 guilders. The exchange rate to the British pound was initially fixed at 1 pound = 12 guilders (1 guilder = 20 pence). In 1836, the guilder was reduced in value to 16 pence and, in 1839, the British pound and British Guiana dollar replaced the guilder as the currency of British Guiana, at the rates of ¬£1 = 15 guilders and $1 = guilders (thus ¬£1 = $4.8; $1 = 4s 2d, or 50d). Coins The first issue of coins from 1798 and 1799 were overstamps on Brazilian pecas. These were followed in 1808 by an issue which consisted of holed Spanish dollars, worth 3 guilders, and the plugs, worth 3 bits (equal to 15 stiver). In 1809, regular coins were issued for Essequibo and Demerara in denominations of , , 1, 2 and 3 guilders, followed in 1813 by and 1 stiver coins and guilder coins from 1832. 1836 saw the introduction of a new series of coins denominated solely in guilders. This year also saw the first production of fourpenny coins by the British Royal Mint for use in British Guiana (worth ¬º guilder) which did not bear any indication of where the coins were to circulate (they later also circulated in the UK). Twopenny coins (worth ‚Öõ guilder) were issued in the same way from 1838. Banknotes Demerary and Essequebo, 10 joes (220 guilders) of the 1830s In the 1830s, the colonies issued paper money denominated in joes and guilders. There were notes of 1, 2, 3 and 10 joes (22, 44, 66 and 220 guilders). It wasn‚Äôt until 1916 that the Government of British Guiana begin issuing dollar-denominated banknotes. Banknotes produced specifically for British Guiana ceased in 1942, and were replaced by British West Indies dollars in 1951. In 1955, the British West Indies dollar was decimalized and issued in the name of the British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group. In 1965, the East Caribbean dollar replaced the British West Indies dollar and circulated in British Guiana for a year until, following independence in 1966, the Guyanese dollar was introduced, replacing the East Caribbean dollar at par.

Brinsley Schwarz version The song was originally released in 1974 on the album The New Favourites of... Brinsley Schwarz by Lowe's band Brinsley Schwarz and released as a single; this version has been included in the following Lowe compilations: 2002's Anthology (along with the Elvis Costello version), 2009's Quiet Please... The New Best of Nick Lowe, 1991's Surrender to the Rhythm: The Best of Brinsley Schwarz, 1996's Naughty Rhythms: The Best of Pub Rock 1970‚Äì1976, and 1998's Pub Rock: Paving the Way for Punk. Lowe has not released a solo studio version of the song, but plays it regularly in concert, and live versions have appeared as B-sides of his 1982 double 45 single \\"My Heart Hurts\\", and his 1994 EP True Love Travels on a Gravel Road, on the radio compilations KGSR Broadcasts Vol. 3, Q107's Concerts in the Sky: the Campfire Versions, and Live at the World Cafe 10th Anniversary, some with solo acoustic guitar and some with different full bands. Another live Lowe version appeares on his 2004 live album Untouched Takeaway, and a live Brinsley Schwarz version is included on What IS so Funny About Peace Love and Understanding?, which featured songs played live in BBC sessions. Lowe also produced a cover version of the song as a B-side for the 1991 single \\"See Saw\\" by the British band the Katydids, after producing their eponymous debut album. Elvis Costello & the Attractions version The Elvis Costello & the Attractions version was first issued as the B-side of Lowe's 1978 single \\"American Squirm\\", credited to \\"Nick Lowe and His Sound\\". At the time, Lowe was Costello's producer, and he produced this track as well. When the song became a hit, it was quickly appended as the last track to the US edition of Costello's album Armed Forces. It has appeared on most of Costello's \\"Best of...\\" compilations over the years, as well as on the soundtrack to the film 200 Cigarettes. Live versions appeared on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Volume 7: 2002‚Äì2003, and 2012's The Return of the Spectacular Spinning Songbook, both by Elvis Costello and the Attractions. In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked this version of the song as the 284th best song of all time. Modern Drummer said of drummer Pete Thomas' performance, \\"A beautiful thing happens on this song, common to many early Attractions songs. It‚Äôs that feeling that the track could derail, when in reality Thomas has everything locked down. He does a lot of playing here without overplaying. Like most Attractions songs from that era, this was cut live, full-band and lead vocal. That‚Äôs probably why so many years later, it still sounds so energized and inspired.\\" The video for the song was directed by Chuck Statler. The Bodyguard A version of the song was included on the soundtrack album for the film Produced by Danny Kortchmar The Bodyguard, which sold 17 million copies in the United States alone. This version was performed by jazz singer Curtis Stigers, who also used it as a B-side to the single \\"Sleeping with the Lights On\\" from his eponymous debut album, which had been released the year before. According to Will Birch's book on pub rock, No Sleep Till Canvey Island, the cover royalties from Stigers' version of the song made Lowe wealthy. Lowe, however, asserts that he used most of the money to support a subsequent tour with full band. Stigers later covered a second Lowe song, \\"You Inspire Me\\", on the 2003 album of the same name. Other recordings and performances John Lennon quotes the song in his 1980 Rolling Stone interview with Jonathan Cott. In 2004 \\"(What's So Funny 'bout) Peace, Love and Understanding\\" was regularly performed as an all-star jam on the Vote for Change tour, which featured a rotating cast of headliners. The 11 October concert at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. was broadcast live on the Sundance Channel and on radio. This version of the song featured Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, the Dixie Chicks, Eddie Vedder, Dave Matthews, and John Fogerty with Michael Stipe, Bonnie Raitt, Keb' Mo', and Jackson Browne. In response to the October 27, 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting at Tree of Life, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based band The Clarks released a cover of the song, with all proceeds going to the synagogue.

Empanadas galegas Galician bread Xam√≥n asado The potato is a staple food in the region, first arriving in Spain from the Americas in the 16th century, and then grown first and foremost on the coasts of the R√≠a de Noia. In Galician cuisine, neither the cook nor the recipe really matters; what is being served is the central part of the cuisine. In Galicia, a wide variety of sea produce can be found in traditional dishes, due to the province's long shoreline and traditional fishing economy. Agriculture products such as potatoes, maize, and wheat are also staples in the Galician diet, along with dairy and meat products from cattle, sheep, and pigs; Galicia's grasses are green year-round and are excellent for grazing. Due to the history of a weak economy, little industry, and overall a less-than- prominent position in Spanish politics and culture, the development of a Galician haute cuisine has been slowed until recently, with chefs such as To√±i Vicente gaining national attention only since the 1980s.

Early life and education Parker was born in Melbourne on 23 June 1920. The son of Captain C. A. Parker, he was educated at Xavier College, Melbourne.

In 1947, when Philip was created Duke of Edinburgh in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, Parker joined the Household of the Duke of Edinburgh as Private Secretary, initially on a part-time basis. He also became Equerry to the Duke and the Duchess of Edinburgh (who later became, in 1952, The Queen). The Duke brought Parker into the \\"Thursday Club\\", an exclusive weekly luncheon group.The Crown: The Scandal That Rocked Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip‚Äôs Marriage Vanity Fair, December, 2017. In 1952, Parker was in Kenya with the royal couple and broke the news to them of King George VI's death. Parker became full-time Private Secretary to the Duke. Parker was created Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1953, and Commander (CVO) in 1957. He accompanied the Duke on his 1956 five month world tour aboard HMY Britannia. Parker's divorce in 1958, reported on extensively in the media, forced him to resign as the Duke's Private Secretary. He was succeeded in that role by James Orr. Parker remained in contact with the Duke until the end of his life. Parker worked for aircraft builder Lockheed Corporation and advertising agency Leo Burnett Worldwide.

Journal of Tropical Forest Science 5(1): 13‚Äì25. Despite being a widespread plant, natural hybrids between N. gracilis and other species are quite rare. Nepenthes gracilis was formally described by Pieter Willem Korthals in his 1839 monograph, \\"Over het geslacht Nepenthes\\". Nepenthes abgracilis from the Philippines is named for its superficial similarity to this species. Carnivory The small, elongated pitchers of N. gracilis appear relatively unremarkable and have a very thin peristome. Nevertheless, the species is unusual (and possibly unique) in that the underside of the pitcher lid bears an uneven layer of wax crystals. This layer is not as thick as, and structurally distinct from, that found in the waxy zone of the pitcher interior, and insects can easily adhere to it in dry conditions. During downpours, however, it functions as part of a trapping mechanism, whereby the impact of raindrops striking the lid causes insects to lose their footing and fall into the pitcher cup below. Distribution Nepenthes gracilis habitat in Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia One of the most widespread Nepenthes species, N. gracilis is native to Borneo, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, central Sulawesi, and southernmost Thailand. It has also been recorded from many smaller islands, including Bangka, Batu Islands, Belitung, Hidayat, S., J. Hidayat, Hamzah, E. Suhandi, Tatang & Ajidin 2003.

After high school, Fletcher continued her music education at Greenville College in Illinois, the Royal Conservatory of Music, and the University of Toronto, studying with Vigo Kihl, Sir Ernest MacMillan and Dr. Healey Willan. She remained for several years as a noted faculty member. Early career In the 1930s she was appointed music editor for Gordon V. Thompson music publishers in Toronto. She was also later on appointed Director of music at Lorne Park College. Publishing and Composing In 1949, Fletcher founded her own music publishing company called Montgomery Music based in Rochester, New York eventually moving it to Buffalo and finally to Markham, Ontario where it currently exists as part of the Mayfair Montgomery Publishing house. She taught piano to young students in the Toronto public schools and to this day her piano methods books (The Leila Fletcher Piano Course) are a highly recommended resource for aspiring young piano students. In her lifetime, she published over 250 piano solos through her publishing house. Personal life Leila Fletcher never married. She was reputed to be difficult to get along with and very demanding in her professional as well as personal life. She also never lived in the United States, preferring to commute to her business in New York state from her home in Hamilton, Ontario.

Sali is a controversial figure in Idaho politics who clashed repeatedly with Republican leadership in the Idaho Legislature. Some of Sali's Republican detractors publicly said that they would back Grant in the general election. All this gave Grant a boost in the general election, but Sali remained favored given the GOP tilt of the area and the popular Otter at the top of the ticket.

Other major dishes include beans with clams (fabes con almejas), Asturian stew, Cachopo, frixuelos, and rice pudding. Asturian cider being poured in the traditional manner. Beverages Apple groves foster the production of the traditional alcoholic drink, a natural cider (sidra). It is a very dry cider, and unlike French or English natural ciders, uses predominantly acidic apples, rather than sweet or bittersweet. The proportions are: acidic 40%, sub-acidic 30-25%, sweet 10-15%, bittersweet 15-20%, bitter 5%.Museo de la Sidra, Nava (Asturias), Spain. Sidra is traditionally poured in by an expert server (or escanciador): the bottle is raised high above his or her head to oxygenate the brew as it moves into the glass below. A small amount (~120ml) is poured at a time (called a cul√≠n), as it must be drunk immediately before the sidra loses its carbonation. Any sidra left in the glass is poured onto a woodchip-strewn floor or a trough along the bottom of the bar.

Several different livres existed, some concurrently. The livre was the name of both units of account and coins. History=Origin and etymology The livre was established by Charlemagne as a unit of account equal to one pound of silver. It was subdivided into 20 sous (also sols), each of 12 deniers. The word livre came from the Latin word libra, a Roman unit of weight, and the denier comes from the Roman denarius. This system and the denier itself served as the model for many of Europe's currencies, including the British pound, Italian lira, Spanish dinero and the Portuguese dinheiro. This first livre is known as the livre carolingienne. Only deniers were initially minted, but debasement led to larger denominations being issued. Different mints in different regions used different weights for the denier, leading to several distinct livres of different values. \\"Livre\\" is a homonym of the French word for \\"book\\" (from the Latin word liber), the distinction being that the two have a different gender. The monetary unit is feminine, la/une livre, while \\"book\\" is masculine, le/un livre. Late medieval and early modern period For much of the Middle Ages, different duchies of France were semi-autonomous if not practically independent from the weak Capetian kings, and thus each minted their own currency. Charters would need to specify which region or mint was being used: \\"money of Paris\\" or \\"money of Troyes\\". The first steps towards standardization came under the first strong Capetian monarch, Philip II Augustus (1165‚Äì1223). Philip II conquered much of the continental Angevin Empire from King John of England, including Normandy, Anjou, and Touraine. The currency minted at the city of Tours in Touraine was considered very stable, and Philip II decided to adopt the livre tournois as the standard currency of his lands, gradually replacing even the livre of Paris, and ultimately the currencies of all French-speaking areas he controlled. This was a slow process lasting many decades and not completed within Philip II's lifetime. The result was that from 1200 onwards, following the beginning of King Philip II's campaigns against King John, the currency used within French speaking lands was in a state of flux, as the livre tournois was gradually introduced into other areas. Until the thirteenth century and onwards, only deniers were actually minted as coin money. Both livres and sous did not actually exist as coins but were used only for accounting purposes. Upon his return from the crusades in the 1250s, Louis IX instigated a royal monopoly on the minting of coinage in France and minted the first gold √©cu d'or and silver gros d'argent, whose weights (and thus monetary divisions) were roughly equivalent to the livre tournois and the denier. Between 1360 and 1641, coins worth 1 livre tournois were minted known as francs. This name persisted in common parlance for 1 livre tournois but was not used on coins or paper money. The official use of the livre tournois accounting unit in all contracts in France was legislated in 1549. However, in 1577, the livre tournois accounting unit was officially abolished and replaced by the √©cu, which was at that time the major French gold coin in actual circulation. In 1602, the livre tournois accounting unit was brought back. Seventeenth century Louis XIII of France stopped minting the franc in 1641, replacing it with coins based on the silver √©cu and gold Louis d'or. The √©cu and louis d'or fluctuated in value, with the √©cu varying between three and six livres tournois until 1726 when it was fixed at six livres. The louis was initially (1640) worth ten livres, and fluctuated too, until its value was fixed at twenty-four livres in 1726. In 1667, the livre parisis was officially abolished. However, the sole remaining livre was still frequently referred to as the livre tournois until its demise. Eighteenth century 10 livres tournois note issued by La Banque Royale (1720) The first French paper money was issued in 1701 and was denominated in livres tournois. However, the notes did not hold their value relative to silver due to massive over‚Äìproduction. The Banque Royale (the last issuer of these early notes) crashed in 1720, rendering the banknotes worthless (see John Law for more on this system). In 1726, under Louis XV's minister Cardinal Fleury, a system of monetary stability was put in place. Eight ounces (a mark) of gold was worth 740 livres, 9 sols (so, one ounce of gold was worth approximately 4 Louis or 93 livres); 8 ounces of silver was worth 51 livres, 2 sols, 3 deniers. This led to a strict conversion rate between gold and silver (14.4867 to 1) and established the values of the coins in circulation in France at: * the Louis d'or (gold coin) of 24 livres * the double Louis d'or (gold coin) of 48 livres * the demi-Louis d'or or half-Louis (gold coin) of 12 livres * the √©cu (silver coin) of 6 livres or 120 sols, along with , and √©cu denominations valued at 60, 30 and 15 sols * the sol (copper coin) denominated in 1 and 2 sol units valued at livre (or 12 deniers) per sol * the denier (copper coin) denominated in 3 and 6 denier units valued at and sol respectively (the three denier coin was also called a liard). A coin of value 1 livre was not, however, minted. Yet in 1720 a special coin minted in pure silver was produced and assigned an over-value of 1 livre. Additionally, France took Navarrese 20-sol coins minted in 1719 and 1720, re-struck them as √©cu (between the years of 1720 and 1723) essentially creating a coin worth 1 livre. These re-struck coins, however, eventually were assigned the value of 18 sols. Assignat for 125 livres (1793) A kind of paper money was reintroduced by the Caisse d'Escompte in 1776 as actions au porteur, denominated in livres. These were issued until 1793, alongside assignats from 1789. Assignats were backed (in theory) by government-held land. Like the issues of the Banque Royale, their value plummeted. The last coins and notes of the livre currency system were issued in Year II of the Republic (1794). In 1795, the franc was introduced, worth 1 livre 3 deniers ( livres), and the first one-franc coin was struck in 1803. Still the word livre survived; until the middle of the 19th century it was indifferently used alongside the word franc, especially to express large amounts and transactions linked with property (real estate, property incomes or \\"rentes\\", cattle, etc...). Later history The livre had also been used as the legal currency of the Channel Islands. The Jersey livre remained legal currency in Jersey until 1834 when dwindling supplies of no-longer minted coins obliged the adoption of the pound as legal tender. Today, France uses the euro as its currency.

Originally a fighter in the Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) militia during the first Chadian Civil War, under D√©by he became a civil servant before defecting to the rebels in 2003. After having been for a time first in the FUC and later in the UFDD, he has founded in 2007 the UFDD-Fundamental, which has participated in February 2008 to the unsuccessful attack on N'Djamena. A Missiria Arab, Abdelwahid was born in 1953 near to Oum Hadjer in Batha. He fought as a CDR militant in 1980 in the second battle of N'Djamena which saw confronted the President Goukouni Oueddei and his Defence Minister Hiss√®ne Habr√©; during the confrontation Abdelwahid was wounded, and since then he has always limped. Successively he became a civil servant, and occupying under the government of Idriss D√©by the office of subprefect. In 2003 Abdelwahid broke with D√©by and passed in open rebellion. He became secretary-general of the Chadian rebel group FIDEL, and, after the group's union with other organizations, one of the leaders of the newly formed United Front for Democratic Change (FUC) rebel alliance, founded in December 2005 and under the presidency of Mahamat Nour Abdelkerim. On January 19, 2006, Abdelwahid was arrested, along with nineteen other rebels, after participating in an interview to Radio France Internationale in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, in which he stated that \\"FUC's relations with the Sudanese government are friendly - very close\\", and argued that this was in line with the tradition under which successive Chadian rebellions had seized power with some degree of support from Khartoum. The Sudanese government repeatedly denied the accusation of Chadian President Idriss D√©by that the Sudanese government was providing financial and material support to the FUC. He was released from jail shortly after. His arrest was denounced by the Dakar-based human rights organization (RADDHO)http://www.panapress.com/freenewspor.asp?code=por028799&dte;=25/01/2006 Abdelwahid organized in April together with Nour the attack on the capital, which ended in a defeat for the rebels. During those days D√©by arrested for fear of collusion with the rebels the general Ahmat Fadoul Makaye, the Chadian army's Deputy Chief of Staff and cousin of Abdelwahid. He was cleared of all suspicions and freed three days later. The latter was removed on September 26 with Issa Moussa Tamboul√© from the FUC's political bureau; he was allegedly suspected of secretly plotting with the D√©by government. Around the same time Abdelwahid, who represented an Arab faction increasingly hostile to Nour since his failed attack, using his position of secretary-general destituted Nour. Following this, Abdelwahid with a group of FUC dissidents united with Acheikh ibn Oumar's Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) and Mahamat Nouri's Union of Forces for Progress and Democracy (UFPD) to found on October 22 the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD). In April 2007, a major crisis shook the UFDD, when the Vice-President Acheikh ibn Oumar demanded Nouri a major role to his men in movement's apparatus. Nouri refused and expelled Acheikh and consolidated the control of his ethnic group, the Gorane, over the UFDD After Acheikh, also Abdelwahid, anxious to retake his freedom of movement from Nouri, left the UFDD and founded in May with Acheikh a new armed group, the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development-Fundamental (UFDD-F), an Arab-dominated group\\"Une alliance de circonstance entre les groupes rebelles tchadiens\\", Le Monde, 4-2-2008. estimated to count on about 500 militants. Abdelwahid took part to the peace talks held through Libyan mediation in Tripoli between the Chadian government and the leaders of four rebel movements, the UFDD with Nouri, the Rassemblement des Forces pour le Changement (RFC) with Timane Erdimi, The Chadian National Concord with Hassan Saleh al-Djinedi and the UFDD-F. At the beginning of the talks on June 23, Abdelwahid stated that the \\"problem is mostly of a constitutional order\\", adding that they \\"demand a revision of the constitution to reopen the road to transition\\". An important stage in the talks was reached on October 3 when the government and the four rebel groups signed an accord in Tripoli on power- sharing in the government and the integration of the rebel forces in the Chadian army. Among the rebel leaders, Abdelwahid was the only one to call the paper signed a \\"definitive accord\\", while the others only considered it provisional.http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=APA34427pouvoerreug0 Due to the latters objection the four rebel leaders signed on October 25 a new accord in Surt, presumed to be definitive, under which the armed movements would disarm in November and become political parties. The accord was broken already on November 26, giving way to violent fighting between the rebels and the government. In December, due to Sudanese pressures, reapproached himself to Nouri and Erdimi, forming with them in mid-December a Unified Military Command with Abderahman Koulamallah as spokesman. Abdelwahit claimed that after his bases within Sudan were attacked twice by the Chad Air Force, first on December 28 and later on January 6, 2008.\\"Chad declares right to pursue rebels in Sudan after bombings\\", AFP, 8-1-2008. By the end of January, the three rebels leaders put on the ground 3,000 men for an attack on the capital to deal onca and for all with D√©by. The forces reach the capital, but are defeated after a battle that leaves 160 dead on the ground, forcing the rebels to retreat.

The programme usually features guest artists between the orchestral pieces, who sing with full orchestral accompaniment. Occasionally, artists such as Donny Osmond and Alanis Morissette perform in the larger venues. The programme also showpieces certain sections of the orchestra and features guest instrumentalists, for example the BBC Big Band.

Synopsis Print of a portrait of Captain Wedderburn, the younger Versions differ, but generally a captain meets a lady walking in the woods or through an estate. Sometimes he takes her to where he is staying. In all variants, she says she will not marry or sleep with him without his answering riddles. She asks them. He answers them all, and they are married and/or he takes her to bed. Motifs The ingenious suitor who can answer every riddle, or nonplus the heroine, is not as common as the clever maid, but occurs quite frequently in folklore.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 416, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Recordings In 1954, Thomas Moran from Mohill, Co. Leitrim, Ireland was recorded . * In 1964, Canadian Folk duo Ian and Sylvia recorded this ballad as \\"Captain Woodstock's Courtship\\"; their version is from a Nova Scotia collection by Folklorist Helen Creighton. * Tim Hart and Maddy Prior recorded the ballad in 1968 on Folk Songs of Old England Vol. 2. * The Great Big Sea song \\"Captain Wedderburn\\" on their Turn album is based on this ballad. * In 1988 The Voice of the People Vol 1 Come Let Us Buy the Licence - Songs of Courtship & Marriage included the ballad as The Song of the Riddles sung by Willie Clancy * In 2007 Cara Luft recorded the song \\"Lord Roslyn's daughter\\" on the album The Light Fantastic. * Bellowhead recorded a version on their 2010 album Hedonism. * In 2012 The Voice of the People Second Series Good People, Take Warning : Ballads by British and Irish Traditional Singers included Captain Wedderburn sung by S√©amus Ennis.

(1886) *Nepenthes tentaculata var. tomentosa Macfarl. (1908) Description Nepenthes tentaculata is a climbing plant. The stem may reach a length of 3 m and is up to 5 mm in diameter. Internodes are circular to triangular in cross section and up to 10 cm long.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. A rosette plant from Sulawesi The leaves of this species are sessile. The lamina or leaf blade is lanceolate to elliptic in shape and up to 15 cm long by 3 cm wide. Its apex is rounded to acute, while the base is amplexicaul and cordate, encircling the stem. Up to 4 longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are irregularly reticulate. Tendrils are up to 15 cm long. The pitchers of N. tentaculata are generally quite small, rarely exceeding 15 cm in height. However, in exceptional specimens they may be up to 30 cm high by 8 cm wide. Rosette and lower pitchers are ovoid in the basal third and cylindrical above. Upper pitchers are more cylindrical throughout. A pair of fringed wings runs down the front of lower pitchers, while in upper pitchers these are often reduced to ribs. The pitcher mouth is usually ovate, becoming acute at the front and rear. Its insertion very oblique. The peristome is roughly cylindrical in cross section and up to 5 mm wide. It bears small ribs and its inner margin is lined with tiny teeth. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 57% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate and typically obtuse. Often, numerous filiform appendages are present on the upper surface of the lid, concentrated near the edge. However, some forms of the species lack these structures altogether. Nepenthes tentaculata has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 15 cm long and the rachis up to 10 cm long, although female inflorescences are generally shorter than male ones. Pedicels are bract-less and reach 10 mm in length. Sepals are oblong- lanceolate in shape and up to 3 mm long. A study of 210 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (Mj√∂berg 49, collected in Borneo at an altitude of 1700 m) found the mean pollen diameter to be 29.8 Œºm (SE = 0.4; CV = 9.4%).Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1999. Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science 22(1): 1‚Äì7. Nepenthes tentaculata has no indumentum (hairs); all parts of the plant are glabrous. Ecology Nepenthes tentaculata growing in mossy forest on Mount Kinabalu Nepenthes tentaculata has a wide distribution that covers Borneo and Sulawesi. It is particularly widespread in the former, where it has been recorded from almost every mountain exceeding 1000 m. It usually grows at altitudes of between 1200 and 2550 m above sea level. However, on coastal mountains such as Mount Silam in Sabah and Mount Santubong in Sarawak, N. tentaculata has been found at elevations as low as 740 m, and sometimes even down to 400 m. The species typically inhabits mossy forest, although it has also been recorded from ridge-top vegetation on mountain summits. Unlike many other Nepenthes species, N. tentaculata does not occur as an epiphyte; it always grows terrestrially.Clarke, C.M. 2001. A Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sabah. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Plants often grow in clumps of Sphagnum moss, spreading vegetatively via creeping subterranean stems.Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The conservation status of N. tentaculata is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List based on an assessment carried out in 2018. This agrees with an informal assessment made by Charles Clarke in 1997, who also classified the species as Least Concern based on the IUCN criteria. In 1995, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre classified N. tentaculata as \\"not threatened\\".Simpson, R.B. 1995. Nepenthes and Conservation. Curtis's Botanical Magazine 12: 111‚Äì118. Related species Nepenthes tentaculata belongs to what has been called the \\"Hamata group\\", which also includes four other closely related species from Borneo and Sulawesi: N. glabrata, N. hamata, N. muluensis, and N. murudensis.Meimberg, H. & G. Heubl 2006. Introduction of a nuclear marker for phylogenetic analysis of Nepenthaceae. Plant Biology 8(6): 831‚Äì840. More recently, N. nigra has joined this group of related taxa.Nerz, J., A. Wistuba, C.C. Lee, G. Bourke, U. Zimmermann & S. McPherson 2011. Nepenthes nigra, a new pitcher plant from Central Sulawesi. In: McPherson, S.R. New Nepenthes: Volume One. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 468‚Äì491. Nepenthes tentaculata is most easily confused with N. muluensis. The lower pitchers of these species are almost identical, but those of N. muluensis have a rounder mouth. The climbing stem, growth habit and leaves are also similar, although N. muluensis usually has a narrower lamina. However, the upper pitchers of N. muluensis are distinctive; they usually have a white lid, a round mouth, and their wings are either greatly reduced or absent altogether. Nepenthes tentaculata is also similar to N. murudensis, which is often described as resembling a giant form of the species. Nepenthes murudensis differs in lacking filiform hairs on the upper surface of the lid, being more robust in all respects, and having a dense indumentum on inflorescences and some vegetative parts.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106.Steiner, H. 2002. Borneo: Its Mountains and Lowlands with their Pitcher Plants. Toihaan Publishing Company, Kota Kinabalu. However, a number of populations of N. tentaculata from northern Sarawak produce pitchers exceeding 20 cm in height and these may be very similar in appearance to N. murudensis. Nepenthes murudensis also differs in that its aerial pitchers lack wings. Although N. tentaculata is variable in this respect, plants from Mount Murud usually produce upper pitchers with wings.

H. Adam, C. C. Wilcock, and M. D. Swaine.Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1993. One New Natural Hybrid of Nepenthes from Mt. Mulu. Sarawak Museum Journal 43: 291‚Äì294. The authors distinguished the taxon from N. muluensis on the basis of its branched spur and the presence of fringe hairs on the top of the lid. They also compared the distribution of phenolic compounds in the leaves of N. muluensis and the hybrid, although they did so without specifying the number of plants studied or the number of repetitions performed. As a result, doubts have been raised over the existence of this hybrid. Charles Clarke writes that the authors described N. √ó sarawakiensis \\"in such a way that their work cannot be easily repeated\\". Although this natural hybrid is likely to exist, it is possible that N. √ó sarawakiensis was described based on specimens of N. muluensis with lower pitchers. { cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"float: left; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; width: 400px; border: 1px #bbbbbb solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 85%;\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=limegreen  colspan=\\"10\\"  Distribution of phenolic compounds and leucoanthocyanins in N. muluensis, N. tentaculata, and N. √ó sarawakiensis - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=lightgreen  Taxon 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  Specimen - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. muluensis- + ++ +  + -3+-Jumaat 2400 - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. tentaculata + +-¬±- + --Jumaat 2392 - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. √ó sarawakiensis++++++3+- - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=#ffffff N. √ó sarawakiensis (in vitro)++++++++- - align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=lightgreen  colspan=\\"10\\"  Key: 1: Phenolic acid, 2: Ellagic acid, 3: Quercetin, 4: Kaempferol, 5: Luteolin, 6: 'Unknown Flavonoid 1', 7: 'Unknown Flavonoid 3', 8: Cyanidin ¬±: very weak spot, +: weak spot, ++: strong spot, 3+: very strong spot, -: absent } In 2002, phytochemical screening and analytical chromatography were used to study the presence of phenolic compounds and leucoanthocyanins in N. √ó sarawakiensis and its putative parent species. The research was based on leaf material from dry herbarium specimens. Eight spots containing phenolic acids, flavonols, flavones, leucoanthocyanins and 'unknown flavonoids' 1 and 3 were identified from chromatographic profiles. The distributions of these in N. √ó sarawakiensis, N. muluensis and N. tentaculata are shown in the adjacent table. A specimen of N. √ó sarawakiensis grown from tissue culture (in vitro) was also tested. Phenolic acid, 'Unknown Flavonoid 1' and cyanidin were undetected in N. muluensis, while N. tentaculata lacked quercetin, luteolin, 'Unknown Flavonoid 3', and cyanidin. Chromatographic patterns of the N. √ó sarawakiensis samples studied showed complementation of its putative parental species. Myricetin was found to be absent from all studied taxa. This agrees with the findings of previous authorsJay, M. & P. Lebreton 1972. Chemotaxonomic research on vascular plants.

The series was filmed entirely on Masig Island (Yorke Island) in the tropical Torres Strait north of the Cape York Peninsula, the northernmost part of Australia (State of Queensland), and the border with Papua New Guinea. This is an important series to Torres Strait Islanders, but also to the predominantly Anglo Australian community as it highlights the difference between Islanders and mainland Indigenous Australians and the interactions between Islander and Anglo culture. Islander actors and extras are extensively used. The series was released on DVD on 20 February 2006. Outline First aired in early 2006 on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) television, it follows the life of Helen Tremain (Susie Porter), the Remote Area Nurse, charged with providing medical services to the remote Torres Strait Islanders community. Drama The drama comes from the RAN's necessarily close association with the island Chairman, Russ Gaibui (Charles Passi), and his extensive and somewhat dysfunctional family of wife Ina and grown children Eddie, Solomon, Paul (adopted), Nancy and Faith (adopted) and their families and friends, and other characters on the island including some white Australians. The season of six episodes covers topics such as: whites fitting into an Islander culture; alcohol misuse and smuggling in Islander communities; family hostility and love; outsider influence on island life; family tension, life and death; seasons in the tropics and the effect on people, marriage and family. Accuracy The series is portrayed as telling true stories. Many of the idioms of the drama come from local situations. Islanders speak among themselves in their local dialect with subtitles provided for the wider television audience. While non-Islanders can only guess at the accuracy of the portrayal, many extras are Islanders and that there was significant assistance from locals in the production.

An aircraft canopy provides a controlled and sometimes pressurized environment for the aircraft's occupants, and allows for a greater field of view over a traditional flight deck. A canopy's shape is a compromise designed to minimize aerodynamic drag, while maximizing visibility for pilots and other crewmembers. History The raised canopy of a Van's Aircraft RV-7 Very early aircraft had no canopies at all. The pilots were exposed to the wind and weather, although most flying was done in good weather. Through World War I most aircraft had no canopy, although they often had a small windshield to deflect the prop wash and wind from hitting the pilot in the face. In the 1920s and 1930s, the increasing speed and altitude of airplanes necessitated a fully enclosed cockpit and canopies became more common. Early canopies were made of numerous pieces of flat glass held in position by a frame and muntins. The muntins reduced visibility, which was especially problematic for military aircraft. Also, glass canopies were much heavier than acrylic canopies, which were first introduced shortly before World War II. The acrylic bubble canopy was used on aircraft such as the Supermarine Spitfire and Westland Whirlwind, which gave better all-round visibility and reduced weight. It is still being used today on most fighter aircraft. CF-18 Hornet of the RCAF displaying a false canopy In the 1970s, US aviation artist Keith Ferris invented a false canopy to paint on the underside of military aircraft, directly underneath the front of the plane, the purpose of which was to confuse an enemy so they do not know in what direction the aircraft is headed. This ruse was inspired by animals and fishes that have similar markings on the head and tail, so they can confuse other creatures. Pilots remain skeptical of this feature, asserting that if the enemy is close enough to see the marking, they are too close to be fooled by it. Ejection seat system A cockpit view from a BAE Hawk showing the explosive cord in the canopy On many high-performance military aircraft, the canopy is an integral part of the ejection seat system. The pilot cannot be ejected from the aircraft until the canopy is no longer in the path of the ejection seat. In most ejection seat equipped aircraft, the canopy is blown upwards and rearwards by explosive charges. The relative wind then blows the canopy away from the ejection path. However, on some aircraft, such as the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, the pilot may be forced to eject when in a hover, or when going too slow for the relative wind to move the canopy out of the path of the ejection seat. In that situation, the pilot could possibly impact the canopy when ejecting. To overcome that possibility, some aircraft have a thin cord of plastic explosive zig-zagging across the canopy over the pilot's head. In the event of an ejection, the explosive cord is activated first, shattering the canopy. Then the ejection seat and pilot is launched through the shattered canopy. Construction F-15 Eagle canopy Most modern acrylic canopies are vacuum formed. A sheet of acrylic is secured to a female mould, then the entire assembly is heated in an oven until the acrylic is pliable. The air is then removed from the mould and the acrylic sheet is drawn into it, forming the shape of the canopy. The acrylic is then trimmed to the appropriate shape and attached to an aluminum or composite frame. Some one-off canopies are made in a similar fashion, but since a mould would be too time-consuming to make, the acrylic is heated and vacuum formed until it approximates the shape the builder is seeking. This type of construction is less precise, however, and each canopy is unique. If multiple canopies will be needed, a mould is almost always used.  Stealth canopy  Have Glass is the code name for a series of RCS reduction measures for the F-16 fighter. Its primary aspect is the addition of an indium-tin-oxide layer to the gold tinted cockpit canopy, which is reflective to radar frequencies. An ordinary canopy would let radar signals straight through where they would strike the many edges and corners inside and bounce back strongly to the radar source; the reflective layer dissipates these signals instead. Overall, Have Glass reduces an F-16's RCS (radar-cross section) by some 15 percent. The gold tint also reduces glare from the sun to improve visibility for the pilot. Malcolm Hood right The Malcolm Hood is a type of aircraft canopy originally developed for the Supermarine Spitfire. Its concept proved valuable for other aircraft such as the North American Aviation-produced P-51B & C Mustangs as retrofit items, and standard on later versions of the Vought F4U Corsair, and somewhat emulated on the later models of the Luftwaffe's Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter. The canopy was manufactured by the British company R Malcolm & Co which gave its name. Instead of taking a straight line between the canopy frames, the hood was bulged outward. This gave the pilot a better view to the rear. > ...the Corsair's initial deficiencies were being worked out on a concurrent > basis... The 689th production F4U-1 featured a number of significant > changes. The most noticeable was that the cockpit was raised to improve the > pilot's forward view, and a bulged canopy, along the lines of the \\"Malcolm > Hood\\" used on Spitfires, replaced the original \\"birdcage\\" framed canopy to > provide better all-round field of view.

Maugham dedicated the publication to his friend Messmore Kendall. The play, written as three acts, is unique within the total of Maugham's list of 24 plays, in that he changed from his previous methodology of using the naturalistic speech pattern he had been so well known for, to experiment with a more literary dialogue. Despite being a commercial success, Maugham did not repeat the experiment of literary dialogue again in any of his future plays. Plot The play by the Ljubljana Drama Theatre in 1930 The Sacred Flame is the story about the misfortune of Maurice Tabret, previously a soldier of World War I who had returned home unscathed to marry his sweetheart Stella. Unfortunately, after only a year of marriage, Maurice is involved in a plane crash and left crippled from the waist down. The play commences some years later in Gatley House near London, home of Maurice's mother, Mrs. Tabret. Mrs. Tabret's home has been set up to care for her son and a young Nurse Wayland has been Maurice's constant aid throughout. She is extremely professional and devoted to her job. Maurice's wife Stella lives with them also and remains his cheerful companion and support. Maurice's brother Colin Tabret has returned from a time in Guatemala to spend the previous 11 months before the play's start with his brother and the family. The local practitioner Dr. Harvester visits frequently to check on Maurice's condition and to prescribe appropriate treatments. Mrs. Tabret's own husband has passed on some time ago and whilst she does not have a close relationship with anyone else, her old friend retired Major Liconda visits often. All is as well as can be expected until Maurice is found dead in his bed one morning. Not altogether unexpected, Dr. Harvester is prepared to write the death certificate but then Nurse Wayland cries foul and indicates that she believes Maurice was murdered by being given an overdose of his sleeping draught. The play then works through a series of Agatha Christie-style \\"whodunnit\\" scenes as the audience attempt to figure out whether Maurice was killed, took his own life, or else if the whole thing is no more than an imagining and false accusation by the Nurse. For the majority of the second and third act the main suspect is Stella, who it transpires is having an affair with Colin and is pregnant by him. It looks as if the matter will be brought to the coroner and the police, which is likely to mean Stella going on trial for Maurice's murder. At the end of the third act, Mrs. Tabret reveals that it was she that killed Maurice. She had realised that Stella was pregnant, and because Stella's love was all that Maurice lived for, she couldn't bear to see Stella's betrayal exposed. Mrs. Tabret therefore sees her act as a mercy killing. After this revelation, the play ends as Nurse Wayland asks Dr. Harvester to sign the death certificate indicating that Maurice died of natural causes, meaning there will be no police investigation. Productions Messmore Kendall, producer of The Sacred Flame and the person to whom Maugham dedicated the play The Sacred Flame premiered November 19, 1928, at Henry Miller's Theatre in New York City. Gilbert Miller directed the three-act drama, which he co-produced with Messmore Kendall. The play closed December 10, 1928, after 24 performances by the following cast: * Anthony Bushell as Colin Tabret * Clare Eames as Nurse Wayland * Hubert Harben as Major Liconda * Robert Harris as Maurice Tabret * Mary Jerrold as Mrs. Tabret * Eva Leonard- Boyne as Alice * Stanley Logan as Dr. Harvester * Casha Pringle as Stella Tabret The play was produced in London in February 1929, featuring Gladys Cooper in the role of Stella and Mary Jerrold as Mrs Tabret. Revivals In 1966 a major production was presented in the West End starring Gladys Cooper, this time in the role of Mrs Tabret, alongside Wendy Hiller and Leo Genn. There were no major productions between 1967 and 2012, when English Touring Theatre presented a new production for a UK tour. Adaptations In 1929 Hollywood studio Warner Brothers adapted it as an early sound film The Sacred Flame, followed by a German-language version. In 1935 the studio remade the play as The Right to Live starring Colin Clive and George Brent.

They are expected to be able competently to assess and provide clinical care across the life spectrum, from birth through to death, and be able to assess and treat a wide range of medical conditions effectively. As a RAN's work location may be isolated and remote, and may have limited or non-existent medical support, they often assume an extended scope of practice. Skills may include advanced life support (ALS), prescription and supply of medicines, suturing, child birth, nurse immuniser status, performing x-rays, provision of ambulance services including receiving emergency calls (000), and airstrip preparation. Furthermore, when clinical situations are dire, a RAN may be able to perform emergency life saving manoeuvres, usually reserved for medical practitioners, such as laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion, intubation, needle cricothyroidotomy, needle chest decompression and chest drain insertion. In place of a medical practitioner, a RAN generally operates within predefined standard operating orders, such as those contained within the remote primary healthcare manuals (CARPA).

A basquaise is a type of dish prepared in the style of Basque cuisine that often includes tomatoes and sweet or hot red peppers. Overview The traditional pintxos Basque cuisine is influenced by the abundance of produce from the sea on one side and the fertile Ebro valley on the other. The great mountainous nature of the Basque Country has led to a difference between coastal cuisine dominated by fish and seafood, and inland cuisine with fresh and cured meats, many vegetables and legumes, and freshwater fish and salt cod. The French and Spanish influence is strong also, with a noted difference between the cuisine of either side of the modern border; even iconic Basque dishes and products, such as txakoli from the South, or G√¢teau Basque (Biskotx) and Jambon de Bayonne from the North, are rarely seen on the other side. Basques have also been quick to absorb new ingredients and techniques from new settlers and from their own trade and exploration links. Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal created a chocolate and confectionery industry in Bayonne still well-known today, and part of a wider confectionery and pastry tradition across the Basque Country. Basques embraced the potato and the capsicum, used in hams, sausages and recipes, with pepper festivals around the area, notably Ezpeleta and Puente la Reina. Olive oil is more commonly used than vegetable oil in Basque cooking. Cuisine and the kitchen are at the heart of Basque culture, and there is a Museum of Gastronomy in Llodio. One of the staple cookbooks for traditional Basque dishes was initially published in 1933. \\"La cocina de Nicolasa\\" (the Kitchen of Nicolasa) by Nicolasa Pradera has gone into 20 editions. Ways of eating In addition to the dishes and products of the Basque Country, there are features of the way of preparing and sharing food unique to the area. Cider houses (sagardotegiak) are a feature of the hills around Donostia, especially near Astigarraga. These are usually large country restaurants with enormous barrels of cider. Cider is poured from a height straight into the glass for visitors, with a rustic menu invariably of salt cod omelette, grilled T-bone steak and ewes' milk cheese with walnuts and quince paste. The cider houses are only open for a few months of the year. The txikiteo is the tapas crawl from bar to bar seen across Spain, but it reaches its pinnacle in Donostia, with hundreds of people on the streets of the old town wandering from bar to bar, each known for its specialty, whether it be croquettes, tortilla, toast, or seafood. The txikiteo is also popular in cities such as Pamplona and Bilbao. Gerezi beltza arno gorriakin, page 214 is a cherry soup served warm or cold. The cherries are poached in wine, often with enough sugar added to make a light syrup. A cherry without pits is preferred for this dish. To release their flavor, the cherries are carefully pitted or cut in half. Usually the soup is prepared on the day it will be served, because 24 hours is enough time for the cherries to blanch noticeably in the liquid. The soup is often served with a dollop of sour cream, cr√®me fra√Æche, or ice cream. Gastronomic societies are organisations, almost always of men, who cook and eat together in a communal txoko. In large cities, the society's premises can be large and formally organised, but the txoko is frequently a small space owned by a group of friends in smaller towns and suburbs, where food and costs are shared. The first txoko was noted in Donostia in 1870. This unique feature of the Spanish Basque Country enables men to participate in the cooking process and spend time together away from the traditionally formidable matriarchs (etxekoandreak). In recent years, women have been allowed into some clubs. New Basque Cuisine In the 1970s and 1980s Basque chefs were influenced by the nouvelle cuisine of France and created the nouvelle cuisine basque, radically original in its form but solidly Basque in substance, with lighter and less rustic versions of traditional dishes and flavours. The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact, Zalaca√≠n, a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid. Juan Mari Arzak in Donostia became the most famous exponent and one of the first three-star Michelin Guide restaurants in Spain. In a few years the movement swept across Spain, becoming the state's default haute cuisine. Many tapas bars, especially in San Sebasti√°n, serve modern-style pintxos employing novel techniques and ingredients. In more recent years, young chefs, such as Martin Berasategui, have given new impetus to Basque cuisine. International Basque cuisine Basque cuisine has continued to have an influence on international cuisine, particularly in Spain and France where it is highly regarded. Catalan chef Ferran Adri√† has taken the techniques pioneered by Arzak and other Basque chefs to new heights. Karlos Argui√±ano has popularised Basque cuisine in Spain through TV and books. Teresa Barrenechea was among the first people to bring traditional Basque cuisine to America with her first restaurant Marichu in Bronxville in 1991, where she hired Chef Joseba Encabo to set up, develop the menus and run the restaurant till soon later he was offered a position as faculty at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Teresa Barrenechea and husband Raynold von Samson continued to promote Basque cuisine in America by opening their second Marichu restaurant in Manhattan in 1994, which was close to the United Nations Headquarters. Teresa Barrenechea has written two books, The Basque Table (Harvard Common Press, Boston 1998) and The Cuisines of Spain (Ten Speed, Berkley 2005). Teresa Barrenechea is the holder of two awards: Premio Nacional de Gastronom√≠a (National Prize of Gastronomy, the highest culinary award given by the Spanish Administration) and Best Regional Cuisine Book at the 5th World Cookbook Fair, P√©rigueux (France). At the other end of the scale, Basque-style pintxos bars are common in Barcelona and Madrid. In cities where large numbers of Basque people emigrated, such as Buenos Aires, Argentina; S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Boise, Idaho; Fresno, California, and Bakersfield, California, there are several Basque restaurants and a noted Basque influence on the local cuisine.

He did his graduate studies at Princeton University, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1970. His thesis, written under the supervision of Ralph Fox, was titled On homology spheres. An early result of Gonz√°lez-Acu√±a is that a group G is the homomorphic image of some knot group if and only if G is finitely generated and has weight at most one. This result (a \\"remarkable theorem\\", as Lee Neuwirth called it in his review), was published in 1975 in the highly respected journal, Annals of Mathematics. In 1978, together with Jos√© Mar√≠a Montesinos, he answered a question posed by Fox, proving the existence of 2-knots whose groups have infinitely many ends. With Hamish Short, Gonz√°lez- Acu√±a proposed and worked on the cabling conjecture: the only knots in the 3-sphere which admit a reducible Dehn surgery, i.e. a surgery which results in a reducible 3-manifold, are the cable knots. This conjecture is one of the most relevant, unresolved questions in the theory of Dehn surgery on knots in the 3-sphere. Gonz√°lez-Acu√±a has made other significant contributions, which have been published in journals such as Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Topology and Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Fico Gonzalez Acu√±a school of knots and 3-varieties The Fico Gonzalez Acu√±a School of knots and 3-varieties is aimed at the community of students in Mathematics, both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The objective of this school is to present to the students relevant information in the Topology in Low Dimension, mainly in the Theories of Knots and 3-Varieties, presenting interesting and current material that is not usually studied in ordinary courses of degree and masters. This is done through mini-courses and talks given by recognized experts in the area, as well as problem workshops, where students can solve exercises as well as propose new problems. The school is usually realized at CIMAT, during the first days of December.

It is owned by Delta Communications. WNTN is powered at 6,700 watts by day. But because AM 1550 is a Canadian clear channel frequency, WNTN must significantly reduce power at night to three watts. It uses a non-directional antenna at all times. The transmitter is on Birch Street at Bay State Road in Cambridge,Radio-Locator.com/WNTN while the studios and offices are on Fremont Street in Needham. WNTN broadcasts a community- based radio format that includes music and talk features. Much of the programming is aimed at the area's many ethnic cultures, including shows broadcast in Greek, Haitian Creole and Italian, as well as to the area's large Irish population. Weekend programming in English includes The Disco Dance Party and The Benchwarmers. History WNTN signed on April 1, 1968, broadcasting a \\"middle of the road\\" format. After a year of poor ratings, management was convinced, in 1969, to initiate an original format of free-form \\"Adult Rock\\" after 2 PM, somewhat similar in style to the radio industry's current adult album alternative format. WNTN's after 2 PM programming featured an eclectic, freeform rock-based format mixed with folk music, progressive rock, soul music, jazz fusion and various other musical genres. With FM radios still a rarity in cars at the time, the station received a boost in listenership and notoriety, primarily due to the Boston area's high concentration of college students and musicians. The \\"free-form rock\\" hours were later increased to include the entire broadcast day, by 1970. Two of the earliest members of the staff were Music Director John Gorman and afternoon host Denny Sanders, both of whom later relocated to Cleveland, and were instrumental in the rise of that city's influential WMMS in the early 1970s. Also working there during the rock days was a young Howard Stern. The free- form progressive rock format lasted until January 1976, when the format reverted to MOR after the station had been recently sold. In 1977, the station became the first in the Boston radio market to adopt a disco music block. With its unique sound and popular disc jockeys, including Wendy Hunt and Vinnie 'Disco Vinnie' Peruzzi, WNTN experienced a ratings rise and attention from the areas newspapers and television stations. The format's success, however, was short-lived. By the spring of 1978, crosstown FM station WBOS began playing disco music in the evenings and adopted the format full-time that autumn as \\"Disco 93\\". In addition, Wendy Hunt left WNTN to work at WBOS in 1978, as did Vinnie Peruzzi. In 1979, he joined another new FM disco station: WXKS-FM \\"Kiss 108\\". Unable to compete with the two FM disco music stations, WNTN switched its format to adult contemporary music mixed with local news and information in 1977. But that format was short-lived; it flipped within a year to oldies music and within six months had a brief catapult into legitimate Boston ratings as the oldies format managed by Rob Wolf, who had earlier hired Howard Stern. For a brief time in the early 1980s, the station resurrected a disco (or by that time, \\"contemporary dance music\\") format, promoted as the \\"Daytime Nightclub\\". In 1987, the station dropped music and changed to a talk radio format consisting of syndicated national talk shows with local and national news updates. Music programming returned by 1993 in the afternoon hours, consisting of mostly Adult Contemporary however it was dropped completely by 1998. Since the mid-1990s, many local AM stations, including WNTN, experienced a downturn in advertising revenue. WNTN responded by adding leased-time programming, allowing groups and individuals to pay for an allotted amount of time on the station and program it to their taste. The station now airs a variety of talk and music shows aimed at numerous ethnicities and age groups. Move to Cambridge From sign-in in 1968. studios and transmitter were at 143 Rumford Avenue in Auburndale area of Newton. In 2015, a construction permit application was filed to diplex WNTN with WJIB in Cambridge and drop power to 750 watts. In early 2017, the radio station was sold to the host of Grecian Echoes; however, the sale did not include the land or the studio building. The new company, Delta Communications, set up studios and offices in Needham, Massachusetts, and began broadcasting from its new transmitter site in March 2017. In 2018, a modification to increase power to 6,700 watts was approved by the FCC.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1769358 Previous programs * Abundant Life with Bishop Robert Reed * Arabic Evangelical Church * Brase Lide * Celtic Air * Friends Of Abraham * Frugal Yankee * Gallerie Haitienne (Haitian) * Game Starts Now * Jhankar * John Frassica Show * Leading The Way (Arabic) * Lorraine Entertains * Mondo Piccolo (Italian) * Newton North Speaks * Radio Compas (Haitian) * Reel Talk * Roger Sturgis * Saturday Afternoon Live * Soul Of Greece * Sound of Erin * Sports Thursday * UN Radio Howard Stern From August to December 1975, while studying at Boston University, future radio pioneer and self-proclaimed \\"King Of All Media\\" Howard Stern was an on-air personality at WNTN, his first professional job in the radio industry.

It opened in 1990 as the West Yorkshire Playhouse, successor to the original Leeds Playhouse, and was rebranded in June 2018 to revert to the title \\"Leeds Playhouse\\". It has two auditoria and hosts a wide range of productions and engages in outreach work in the local community. History The origins of Leeds Playhouse lie in the Leeds Playgoers' Society, founded in 1907 as an off-shoot of the Leeds Arts Club, to stage contemporary drama by writers such as Shaw, Ibsen and Chekov, and hold lectures and discussions on contemporary drama. The idea of creating a Leeds Playhouse dates from 1964, when a campaign was started for a permanent home for modern and contemporary theatre in Leeds. Despite some opposition from the local council on the grounds that Leeds already had a theatre (the Grand Theatre), a public appeal was launched to raise funds at a mass meeting in Leeds Town Hall on 5 May 1968. The meeting was addressed by Peter O'Toole, Keith Waterhouse, and the actor and joint artistic director of Nottingham Playhouse, John Neville, amongst others. ¬£20,000 was raised by public subscription, but the project still needed support from Leeds City Council. The Council eventually promised ¬£25,000, and ¬£5,000 annually if necessary. This, along with grants from the Arts Council and the Gulbenkian Foundation, meant that the project could go ahead and the Leeds Playhouse opened in 1970 in premises loaned to the Leeds Theatre Trust by the University of Leeds. The first performance was held on Wednesday 16 September 1970 with Tony Robinson, who later went on to play Baldrick in the television series Blackadder, starring as Simon in Alan Plater's play Simon Says, directed by Bill Hays. The following month Robinson also appeared in The Merry Wives of Windsor by William Shakespeare, where he played Abraham Slender.Archives of the Leeds Playhouse, Brotherton Collection, University of Leeds, MS 20c The Leeds Playhouse turned into the West Yorkshire Playhouse in March 1990 when it relocated to the Quarry Hill area of the city as part of a major regeneration scheme. In June 2018, it rebranded as Leeds Playhouse once again. Redevelopment at Leeds Playhouse (13 December 2018) Leeds Playhouse Building Leeds Playhouse was designed by The Appleton Partnership architects of Edinburgh. The complex comprises: The Quarry Theatre (750 seats), The Courtyard Theatre (350 seats), a CAMRA award-winning bar with wireless internet connection, a restaurant, the Newlyn Gallery, two function rooms (the Congreve Room and the Priestley Room), three rehearsal spaces, a recording studio, extensive technical workshops, dressing rooms, a costume hire department and offices for production, administrative and artistic teams. The foundation stone was laid by Judi Dench in 1989, and on completion it was opened by Diana Rigg. The theatre was completed at a cost of ¬£13 million.Morgan, John and Joy, David: A Celebration of Leeds, page 43. Great Northern Press, 2006. The building underwent a ¬£15.8 million redevelopment in 2019: creating a new foyer, improving access throughout the building, moving the front of the building to face the city and creating the Bramall Rock Void studio space (60 seats). Productions According to the Leeds Playhouse website it has established a reputation both nationally and internationally as one of Britain's most exciting producing theatres, winning awards for everything from its productions to its customer service, and it is \\"the largest regional repertory theatre in the UK outside London and Stratford\\". The theatre's first artistic director was Jude Kelly (1990‚Äì2002). Her successor was Ian Brown who ran the theatre until passing the baton to James Brining in the autumn of 2012. Productions cover a wide range from classic drama to modern European theatre and children's shows. There is an emphasis on new writing, especially from the north of England. There are many coproductions with other regional theatres, some of which go on to tour or transfer to London theatres. Visiting companies include Northern Broadsides, Kneehigh Theatre and Peepolykus. The theatre was home to the original version of the musical Spend Spend Spend, the story of the life of Viv Nicholson, the 1961 famous Pools winner and author of the book of the same name. The original, starring Rosemary Ashe appeared at the Playhouse before it went on to West End success starring Barbara Dickson. A typical season includes four or five major productions which run for three or four weeks, and a number of one-week or shorter runs which may be by visiting companies. A typical recent season (Autumn-Winter 2007) included: Casanova by Carol Ann Duffy and Told By An Idiot, with Lyric Hammersmith; a stage adaptation of Don Quixote; Brief Encounter with Kneehigh Theatre and Birmingham Repertory Theatre; Rough Crossings adapted by Caryl Phillips from Simon Schama's book; Salonika, first performed at the Royal Court Theatre in 1982. There were 6 plays with shorter runs, a visiting production by Northern Ballet Theatre, and two Christmas shows, one for small children and a revived co-production with Birmingham Repertory Company of Adrian Mitchell's dramatisation of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Tony Harrison satyr play The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus was performed at the theatre in 1998. The playhouse has a strong record of supporting new writers, like Zodwa Nyoni, whose first play Boi Boi Is Dead they commissioned. Financial support The theatre receives funding from Arts Council England (¬£1,100,000) and Leeds City Council (¬£820,000), West Yorkshire Grants and Leeds Education Authority. It also encourages corporate sponsorship. The theatre is a member of the European Theatre Convention.

Ivanhoe (born January 17, 1954) is an historian of Chinese thought, particularly of Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism. He is a professor at the Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea. Ivanhoe is perhaps best known for two claims: that Neo-Confucian philosophers such as Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming have systematically misinterpreted earlier Confucians such as Confucius, himself, and Mengzi; and that Confucianism may usefully be understood as a version of virtue ethics. Biography Ivanhoe was raised in New Jersey (US) by parents who owned a variety of small businesses, including a butcher shop, where he worked until leaving for college. He attended Stanford University on a scholarship, where he earned a B.A. (1976) in Philosophy, and also studied the Chinese language. From 1976 to 1978, Ivanhoe stayed on at Stanford to work with David S. Nivison on a project to generate computerized concordances of Chinese texts. From 1974 to 1978, he served in the United States Marine Corps, PLC and was honorably discharged at the rank of sergeant. From 1978 to 1982, he served in the U. S. Army. He left the army at the rank of sergeant, with an honorable discharge, and returned to Stanford to pursue his doctorate in Religious Studies (awarded 1987), also completing the requirements for a minor in Asian Languages. At Stanford, Ivanhoe studied under Nivison, a leading Sinologist who had applied the methods of analytic philosophy to the study of Chinese thought, and Lee H. Yearley, a scholar of Thomas Aquinas and comparative religion. Upon Nivison's retirement, Ivanhoe was given a joint appointment as an assistant professor in both the Philosophy Department and the Religious Studies Department at Stanford (1991). In 1993, Ivanhoe won the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for Outstanding Service to Undergraduate Education. In 1996, Ivanhoe was promoted to associate professor. Then in 1998 Ivanhoe moved to the University of Michigan, where he was hired at the associate professor level in the Philosophy Department and the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures. In 2003, Ivanhoe left Michigan and became Findlay Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Boston University. In 2006 he accepted his appointment at City University of Hong Kong. His courses included Feminism and Family Ethics, Philosophy of Life, and Ethics and Practice. In 2018 Ivanhoe moved to Sungkyunkwan University as a Distinguished Chair Professor in the College of Confucian Studies and Eastern Philosophy. He serve as editor in chief of the Journal of Confucian Philosophy and Culture at the Institute of Confucian Philosophy and Cultures and director of a new research center within the College of Confucian Studies and Eastern Philosophy tentatively named the Confucian Institute for East Asian Philosophy (CIEAP). Ivanhoe is married and has two children, a daughter and a son. He currently lives in Seoul. Intellectual contributions Ivanhoe was influenced by Nivison's suggestion that Neo-Confucians, although they were harsh critics of Buddhism, were more deeply influenced by Buddhist philosophical concepts than they realized. As a result, Neo-Confucians misinterpreted their own intellectual tradition. Ivanhoe developed Nivison's insight in great detail in his doctoral dissertation, a revised version of which was later published as a book, Ethics in the Confucian Tradition: The Thought of Mengzi and Wang Yangming. In this book, Ivanhoe contrasts the views of the ancient Confucian Mengzi (also known as \\"Mencius\\") with that of the Neo-Confucian Wang Yangming on several topics, including \\"sagehood\\" and \\"ethical cultivation,\\" and demonstrates how the influence of Buddhist ideas on Wang leads him to mis-read Mengzi, even when he believes that he is explicating him. Ivanhoe applied this idea more broadly in his next major book, Confucian Moral Self Cultivation. In the first edition of this book, Ivanhoe argued that Chinese philosophers can be categorized in terms of whether they use a \\"development,\\" \\"discovery\\" or \\"re-formation\\" model of ethical cultivation. (Ivanhoe was one of the co- developers of this terminology, along with A.C. Graham, his classmate Kwong- loi Shun, and his student Jon Schofer.) In a development model, ethical cultivation is a process of beginning from innate but incipient tendencies and gradually developing them. (So, for example, the ancient Confucian Mengzi says that \\"sprouts\\" of virtue must be cultivated to develop into full virtues.) According to a discovery model, humans have within themselves everything that is necessary for full virtue, but this capacity is somehow impeded or obscured, and cultivation is a process of realizing what is present within oneself. (Ivanhoe argues that Chinese Buddhists and Neo-Confucians, despite their genuine differences on many topics, share a discovery model of ethical cultivation.) Finally, in a re-formation model, human nature is originally resistant to cultivation, and must be laboriously re-shaped in order to create virtue. (Ivanhoe argues that the ancient Confucian Xunzi held such a view.) In the second edition of Confucian Moral Self Cultivation, Ivanhoe further subdivided the types of self-cultivation models. Ivanhoe's influence on themes such as the virtues, ethical cultivation and human nature reflects the influence of Yearley's view that Confucianism may be understood as a form of virtue ethics. Ivanhoe has co-edited a number of anthologies of secondary essays on Chinese thought, and has published a large number of essays and articles in reference works on Confucianism, Mohism and Daoism.

Examples are: * rupture of a pipe or hull especially below the waterline and * damage from grounding (running aground) or hard berthing against a wharf. * temporary fixing of bomb or explosive damage. Measures used Simple measures may stop flooding, such as: * locking off the damaged area from other ship's compartments; * blocking the damaged area by wedging a box around a tear in the ship's hull, * putting a band of thin sheet steel around a tear in a pipe, bound on by clamps. More complicated measures may be needed if a repair must take the pressure of the ship moving through the water. For example: * Thermal lance cutting around the rupture. * Oxyacetylene welding or electric arc welding of plates over the rupture. * Quick-drying cement is applied underwater over the rupture. Damage control training is undertaken by most seafarers, but the engineering staff are most experienced in making lasting repairs. Damage control is distinct from firefighting. Damage control methods of fighting fire are based on the class of ship and cater to ship specific equipment on board. Notable contemporary examples Damage to USS Cole Particular examples: * USS Samuel B. Roberts: After an Iranian mine holed the frigate beneath the waterline in 1988, the crew fought fire and flooding that threatened to sink it. * USS Princeton: After an Iraqi naval mine damaged the cruiser during the 1991 Gulf War, her crew fought fires and sealed cracks in the hull, then repaired electronic systems, bringing the Aegis combat system back on line within 2 hours. * USS Cole: immediate measures to stop sinking after the ship was bombed in 2000. * HMS Nottingham: measures to keep the ship afloat after, on 7 July 2002, the Nottingham ran aground on the submerged but well-charted Wolf Rock near Lord Howe Island.

Forces loyal to Emperor Go-Daigo and led by Nitta Yoshisada entered the city from multiple directions and destroyed it; in the end, the H≈çj≈ç leaders retreated to T≈çsh≈ç-ji, the H≈çj≈ç family temple, where they committed suicide with the rest of the clan. Background For ten days, Nitta had been leading the imperial loyalists on a rapid cross country campaign before reaching the outskirts of Kamakura. After the Battle of Bubaigawara ended two days prior, the H≈çj≈ç forces rushed back to Kamakura to consolidate defenses. Nitta aggressively pursued and divided his forces into three prongs, thus completely surrounding the landward sides of the city. Only the seaward side, which was fortified by H≈çj≈ç ships, remained open. Battle for Kamakura The hills surrounding Kamakura contained seven passes, (the so- called Seven Entrances or Mouths), each with guarded checkpoints. Nitta Yoshisada attacked from the west, east and the north through the Gokuraku Pass, the Nagoe Pass and the Kewaizaka Pass, dividing his forces in three. However, after many hours of fighting, little progress had been made towards the city, particularly on the western passes near Gokuraku-ji, which was guarded with rows upon rows of wooden shielding. Nitta realized the Gokuraku- ji could be bypassed by marching around the cape, where the Inamuragasaki promontory juts out into the water. However, the waters were fortified by H≈çj≈ç ships making the approach impossible without heavy losses. According to the chronicles, Nitta threw his sword into the sea as an offering to the sun goddess, Amaterasu, and the sea parted as if by a miracle clearing a beach wide enough for Nitta's army to traverse.McCullough, Helen Craig (1959): pp. 285-311.In describing this event, Japanese sources say Nitta Yoshisada prayed to a sea-god or a dragon-god, English sources almost always refer to Sun Goddess Amaterasu. The Taiheiki itself (Á®≤ÊùëÂ¥éÊàêÂπ≤ÊΩü‰∫ã) says: > Dismounting from his horse, Yoshisada removed his helmet and prostrating > himself across the distant seas prayed to Ry≈´jin. \\"It is said that the lord > of Japan from the beginning, Amaterasu ≈åmikami, enshrined at Ise Jing≈´, hid > herself within a Vairocana and appeared as Ry≈´jin of the vast blue seas. My > lord (Emperor Go-Daigo) is her descendant, and drifts upon waves of the > western sea due to rebels. I Yoshisada, in an attempt to serve as a worthy > subject, will pick up my axes and face the enemy line. That desire is to aid > the nation and bring welfare to the masses. Ry≈´jin of the Eight Protectorate > Gods of the (seven) Inner Seas and the Outer Sea, witness this subject‚Äôs > loyalty and withdraw the waters afar, open a path to the lines of the three > armies. Yoshisada therefore speaks to Ry≈´jin who, he has heard, is manifestation of Amaterasu. Though in fact they were taking advantage of a very low tide. Thus the imperial loyalists were able to enter the city, and began to force back the H≈çj≈ç forces. The H≈çj≈ç were eventually forced to retreat to a cave behind the T≈çsh≈ç-ji, where they committed suicide. NotesBibliography * McCullough, Helen Craig (1959). \\"The Taiheiki.

Sydney Smith grew up in a family of musicians. His father was the head of a music school and often gave concerts with his two sons Sydney and Boyton. Smith was born in Dorchester, Dorset. He studied piano in Leipzig with Moscheles and Plaidy, cello with Gr√ºtzmacher, and composition with Rietz. He returned to England in 1858, settling the following year in London, where he remained until his death, highly regarded as a teacher and composer. He composed or transcribed about 400 works for the piano. These were extremely popular in salons in England in the 19th century, particularly the early works. Many pieces were issued both as solo pieces and as piano duets. His earliest compositions are piano accompaniments to three concertina pieces by Richard Blagrove. Apart from these, he composed only for solo piano until the last few years of his life, when he wrote a small handful of songs. Amongst his best known works are: The Fairy Queen op. 42, Ga√Æet√© de Coeur op. 24, I Puritani op. 85, Lily of the Valley op. 14, La Harpe Eolienne op. 11, Le Jet d‚ÄôEau op. 17, Chanson Russe op. 31 and the Tarantelle Brillante op. 8. He wrote many other morceaux de salon for piano solo, and made many arrangements from popular operas. In addition to the works published under his own name, he also published a number of piano works under the names Paul Beaumont and Victor Delacour. Op. 17, 'Le Jet de l' Eau', was used as the theme for 'The Foley Family', a drama serial about the comic lives of a Dublin family, which ran on the Irish national radio service Radio √âireann from 1952 to the late 1960s. It was written by David Hayes and starred George Green and Peg Monaghan.

Its 13 illustrated chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the Cosmos TV series, which the book was co-developed with and intended to complement, explore the mutual development of science and civilization. One of Sagan's main purposes for the book and television series was to explain complex scientific ideas to anyone interested in learning. Sagan also believed the television was one of the greatest teaching tools ever invented, so he wished to capitalize on his chance to educate the world.Golden, Frederic, Peter Stoler, and Calif. 1980. \\"The Cosmic Explainer He-e-e-re's Carl, bringing you nothing less than the universe.\\" Time 116, no. 16: 62. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed April 10, 2013). Spurred in part by the popularity of the TV series, Cosmos spent 50 weeks on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list and 70 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list to become the best-selling science book ever published at the time. In 1981, it received the Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book. The book's unprecedented success ushered in a dramatic increase in visibility for science-themed literature. The success of the book also jumpstarted Sagan's literary career. The sequel to Cosmos is Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space (1994). In 2013, Cosmos was published in a new edition, with a foreword by Ann Druyan and an essay by Neil deGrasse Tyson. Summary Cosmos has 13 chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the Cosmos television series. In the original edition, each chapter is heavily illustrated. The book covers a broad range of topics, comprising Sagan's reflections on anthropological, cosmological, biological, historical, and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times. Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial life‚Äîthat the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien civilizations, but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth. Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of science and civilization. He traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method, mixing science and philosophy, and speculates about the future of science. He also discusses the underlying premises of science by providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists, placing their contributions in the broader context of the development of modern science. The book, like the television series, contains a number of Cold War undertones including subtle references to self- destruction and the futility of the arms race. Style and contents Cosmos utilizes a light, conversational tone to render complex scientific topics readable for a lay audience. On many topics, the book encompasses a more concise, refined presentation of previous ideas about which Sagan had written. Cosmos is not just about the mysteries of space. Sagan leads every chapter with a philosophical quote to remind readers that the universe is not simply stars and planets, but a link between all things. He reminds readers that \\"we are all star stuff,\\" and, though it seems humans are currently alone in space, the universe was not created for our race to thrive, but that we are a product of something much larger. Sagan's book explicitly supports the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life, as he believes the extraterrestrials will be able to spur an enormous change in life on Earth. Popularity Shortly after release, Cosmos became the best-selling science book ever published in the English language, and was the first science book to sell more than half a million copies. Though spurred in part by the popularity of the television series, Cosmos became a best-seller by its own regard, reaching hundreds of thousands of readers. It was only surpassed in the late 1980s by Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time (1988).Shermer p. 490 Cosmos spent 50 weeks on the Publishers Weekly best-seller's list, and 70 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. Cosmos sold over 900,000 copies while on these lists, and continued popularity has allowed Cosmos to sell about five million copies internationally. Shortly after Cosmos was published, Sagan received a $2 million advance for the novel Contact. This was the largest release given for an unwritten fiction book at the time. The success of Cosmos made Sagan \\"wealthy as well as famous.\\" It also ushered in a dramatic increase in visibility for science books, opening up new options and readership for the previously fledgling genre. Science historian Bruce Lewenstein of Cornell University noted that among science books \\"Cosmos marked the moment that something different was clearly going on.\\" After the success of Cosmos, Sagan turned into an early scientific celebrity. He appeared on many television programs, wrote a regular column for Parade, and worked to continually advance the popularity of the science genre. Lewenstein also noted the power of the book as a recruitment tool. Along with Microbe Hunters and The Double Helix, he described Cosmos as one of the \\"books that people cite as 'Hey, the reason I'm a scientist is because I read that book'.\\" Particularly in astronomy and physics, he said, the book inspired many people to become scientists. Sagan has also been called the \\"most successful popularizing scientist of our time,\\" for his ability to draw such a large and varied audience. The popularity of Sagan's Cosmos has been referenced in arguments supporting increased space exploration spending.Extensions of Remarks - Friday, November 18, 1983, 129 Cong. Rec. E5773 (1983). Sagan's book was also referenced in Congress by Arthur C. Clarke in a speech promoting an end to Cold War anti-ICBM spending, instead arguing that the anti-ICBM budget would be better spent on Mars exploration.Senate - Wednesday, October 10, 1984, 130 Cong. Rec. 31165 (1984) Critical reception Reception for Sagan's work was generally positive. In The New York Times Book Review, novelist James Michener praised Cosmos as \\"a cleverly written, imaginatively illustrated summary of [Sagan's]... ruminations about our universe... His style is iridescent, with lights flashing upon unexpected juxtapositions of thought.\\" The American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson describes \\"Cosmos\\" as something \\"more than Carl Sagan\\".Why Carl Sagan is Truly Irreplaceable https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-carl-sagan-truly- irreplaceable-180949818/ David Whitehouse of the British Broadcasting Corporation went so far as to say that \\"there is not a book on astronomy - in fact not one on science - that comes close to the eloquence and intellectual sweep of Cosmos... If we send just one book to grace the libraries of distant worlds..., let it be Cosmos.\\" Kirkus Reviews described the book as \\"Sagan at his best.\\" Cornell News Service characterized it as \\"an overview of how science and civilization grew up together.\\" In 1981, Cosmos received the Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book.

History Designer began as a component of PerForm, an Electronic forms software package created by Delrina. Delrina was bought by Symantec in 1995, which subsequently sold its Electronic Forms division to JetForm in 1996. JetForm (later renamed Accelio) was purchased by Adobe in 2002. Adobe ended the support of the Accelio version of the product in 2004. In late 2003, Designer was redesigned and released as the Adobe Forms Designer. In March 2004, Adobe shipped Adobe Designer 6.0 for use with Adobe's Intelligent Document Platform and with version 6 of the Adobe Acrobat software. This release included support for creating dynamic forms with data propagated by the Adobe Form Server, support for the XML Data Package (XDP) file format, as well as importing existing forms from Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Output Designer, Microsoft InfoPath and Microsoft Word. In December 2004, Adobe released Designer as Adobe LiveCycle Designer 7.0 as part of the LiveCycle suite of products. This release added the ability to create dynamic forms that do not require the Adobe Form Server for dynamic features, tools for creating Email submissions, and the Paper Forms barcode tool. Designer 7.0 is bundled with Adobe Acrobat Professional 7.0 (on Microsoft Windows only) and available as a stand-alone product. In December 2005, Adobe released Adobe LiveCycle Designer 7.1 as a stand-alone upgrade. Acrobat 8 shipped in November 2006 bundled with a new version of LiveCycle Designer (version 8). LiveCycle Designer was included with Adobe Acrobat Pro Version 9. It is included in Adobe Acrobat X Pro as Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES2, but it is sold separately since Adobe Acrobat XI Pro. However, owners of a prior licensed version of Acrobat Professional who qualify for and purchase an upgrade to Adobe Acrobat XI Professional also qualify for a free upgrade to LiveCycle Designer ES4.http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/upgrade-livecycle- designer-acrobat-xi.html] The core support for Adobe LiveCycle ES4 ended March 2018. Adobe suggests upgrading to Adobe Experience Manager Forms.https://blogs.adobe.com/livecycle/2015/09/five-reasons-to-upgrade-from- livecycle-to-experience-manager-forms.html Features * Designer forms are structured documents with a hierarchical structure that can be converted into XML. This structure can include structure from XML Schema and example XML files. * Designer forms can be saved as PDF files or XDP files. XDP files are used by the Adobe LiveCycle Form Server to render files to PDF or HTML as needed. * PDF forms made in Designer can be designed to be dynamic (changing layout in response to data propagated from other sources), interactive (capable of accepting user input) or both. As of Designer 7.0, dynamic features of these PDF forms can be manipulated by the Adobe Form Server during the rendering process, or by the Adobe Acrobat/Acrobat Reader client during viewing. * Designer allows JavaScript to be embedded into a form, allowing programmatic changes to the form layout as well as communication with various data sources (SOAP, OLEDB). * Besides JavaScript, Designer includes a proprietary scripting language called FormCalc (in Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES2). Limitations * Designer works on a Windows only platform. * Viewing PDF forms made with Designer requires Acrobat/Adobe Reader 6.0.2 or later. * PDF forms made with Designer cannot be edited in Adobe Acrobat, only viewed. * Some features of Designer forms are dependent on 'user rights' activated through the Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions server product. This applies to all PDFs, even ones created with Acrobat and other 3rd party vendors. * Acrobat has been able to make forms since Acrobat 3.0, and there are some third party tools which can work with them in addition to Adobe software. However, these are a type of form now called acroforms. Forms created by Designer are an incompatible type (commonly XFA forms) and are not in general compatible with existing non-Adobe software. Owners of Acrobat 7.0 Professional have the choice of making acroforms directly, or using the bundled (on Windows) copy of Designer to create XFA forms. * When a form object is bound to an xml node, the value from that node may only be extracted once. If several objects share the same binding, only the first object will receive the node value when the form is processed. * There are limitations in the ability of Designer to parse HTML and display it in a form; Designer cannot handle a number of fundamental tags, including ordered list, unordered list and tables.see https://web.archive.org/web/20150706161930/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfa_spec_2_8.pdf page 1081 for supported tags * The program has had a constant issue with users being able to set the tabbing order correctly. The system often reorders the entire form causing the user to have to start over. This problem has never been corrected but can be reduced by the user ensuring every field has a unique name (i.e. Yes/No Radio 1, Yes/No Radio 2, etc.).https://acrobatusers.com/forum/forms-livecycle-designer/tab-sequence- will-not-order-correctly/ * While Livecycle Designer may be the best tool available for Windows users to build dynamic pdf forms, it is known to have a lot of bugs and Adobe does not give it the level of support that it does other applications. Due to this, it does require a learning curve to both reduce and effectively handle the different bugs.http://forms.stefcameron.com/bug-list/ ReferencesExternal links * Adobe LiveCycle Designer * Adobe Designer 6.0 * Enhanced Adobe XML Architecture Supports XML/PDF Form Designer and XML Data Package (XDP), Cover Pages, July 15. 2003 LifeCycle Designer Category:Windows-only software Category:Technical communication tools ","title":"Adobe LiveCycle Designer"},{"id":"3789909","text":"Major General David Crichton Alexander (28 November 1926 ‚Äì 5 January 2017) was a senior Royal Marines officer.

Early life Kenneth Edward Beatrice was born on July 28, 1943. His family was Italian-American. He graduated from Boston College in 1965. During the 1970s, Beatrice worked for the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. He also studied football scouting reports in his spare time. Broadcasting career=WBZ After occasionally appearing on WBZ radio sports shows as a guest, Beatrice joined the station in 1975 as the weekend host of Calling All Sports. He replaced Guy Mainella as weekday host in 1976, but was moved back to weekends after five weeks and succeeded by Bob Lobel. WMAL In 1977, Beatrice joined WMAL as host of Sports Call, the station's nightly sports show, and the Washington Redskins pregame show. He became one of the city's most prominent and highest rated radio hosts. On February 20, 1981, Beatrice admitted to The Washington Star that he had made \\"exaggerations\\" about his accomplishments on the air. He confessed that he did not play football at Boston College, that his doctorate degree was from a diploma mill in Ohio, and that his scouting system only involved people who scouted as a hobby. His admission came as The Washington Post was about to publish a story by Tony Kornheiser written after several weeks of intense questioning in which Beatrice admitted that he had no role in the Boston Patriots drafting Fran Tarkenton. He took a leave of absence after the story broke, but returned after five weeks. On August 16, 1991, Beatrice suffered a heart attack, which required him to undergo triple bypass surgery and miss many weeks of work. By 1995, Beatrice's ratings had decreased to 5,000 listeners per fifteen minutes (down from 20,000 in 1990). On October 4, 1995 it was announced that WMAL was dropping Beatrice's show. The station's decision resulted in 200 phone calls and about 40 letters from supporters. His final program aired on October 6 and featured calls from Washington Redskins head coach Norv Turner, Redskins general manager Charley Casserly, and Washington Bullets head coach Jim Lynam. WTEM On October 16, 1995, Beatrice signed a contract to host a sports program on a radio network owned by Sam Huff. The program originated from Middleburg, Virginia, but was syndicated nationally, including on WTEM in Washington, D.C. On April 20, 2000, Beatrice retired from radio. Style Beatrice was known for his high-pitched voice, pronounced Boston accent, encyclopedic knowledge of sports (especially NFL Draft prospects), opinionated nature, respectful treatment of kids who called into his show, and his long running promos for Arby's. Some believe he had a tendency to talk over guests and callers, go off on tangents, and lecture guests. His catchphrase was \\"You're next!\\" Post-retirement After his retirement, Beatrice settled in Haymarket, Virginia. He was a lector at St. John the Evangelist Church in Warrenton, Virginia, where he also trained other lectors. He died on December 6, 2015 from complications of pneumonia at the age of 72.

It is erroneously called 'garter snake' in the Philippines. It is not venomous and it is the most commonly sold snake as a pet. Though in captivity, they don't live as long as in the wild. There are five subspecies which range in distribution from: southern Burma to Sulawesi, the Philippines and the Maluku Islands. Description Dendrelaphis caudolineatus is a rather small and thin snake, it can reach a length of 180 centimeters but is usually closer to 140 cm. The males are usually thinner than females but are more colorful, ranging from a reddish shade or bright chestnut brown, to a shiny bronze color. The females are usually dull-colored, and more stout-bodied than the males. It is also observed that females of this species tend to be less active than the males. It is mostly arboreal but rarely climbs higher than 4 meters and is mostly found in the open ground or on grassy plains. It has been recorded in most habitats in its range, from coastal lowlands to mountainous areas up to 1500 in elevation. It feeds mainly on lizards and tree frogs.

His family belonged to the Hansan Yi clan. Yi Saek played a crucial role in the introduction and localisation of philosophy of Zhu Xi. He studied Neo-Confucianism in Yuan Dynasty China and opened an academy after his return to Goryeo, and from his academy the founders of Joseon Dynasty were educated. Many of his disciples, such as Jeong Do-jeon and Gwon Geun, used Neo-Confucianism as the ideological basis for overthrowing the Buddhist kingdom of Goryeo and establishing Confucian Joseon. However, Yi Saek himself remained loyal to the Goryeo Dynasty and didn't believe the wiping out of Buddhism, as Jeong Do-jeon insisted, would be of any benefit. Yi Saek believed in the co-existence of the \\"Three Disciplines\\": Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism. Yi Saek resigned from all political positions after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. Not much is known about how he died, but some say that he was murdered while crossing a bridge, like Jeong Mong-ju (four years earlier in 1392). When he was offered the position of Prime Minister by Yi Seong-gye, Yi Saek turned the offer down and told him that he could not serve two kings (of Goryeo and Joseon). Yi Seong-gye subsequently ordered his men to kill him if he was not able to cross the bridge in time, and if he does cross it in time, to let him go. He died because he didn't cross the bridge in time. Yi Saek left various poetry, essays and letters compiled in The Collected Works of Mogeun.

Biography De Aguirre was born at Logro√±o, in Old Castile. He entered the congregation of Monte Cassino. He directed the studies in the Monastery of St. Vincent of Salamanca for fifteen years, and became its abbot. He then qualified in dogmatic theology and inaugurated the course in Holy Scripture at the University of Salamanca. He was councillor and secretary of the Holy Office and president of its congregation of the province of Spain. His work against the Declaration of the Gallican Clergy of 1682 won him a cardinal's hat and the warm eulogy of Innocent XI. His correspondence with Bossuet shows how vigorously he combated Quietism. His excessive labors undermined his health, and for many years he suffered from epileptic seizures. He died suddenly from a stroke of apoplexy. He was buried in the Spanish Church of St. James in Rome, and his heart was deposited in Monte Cassino, as he had requested. Works His more important works are on philosophical and theological subjects, but he also produced valuable writings on ecclesiastical history, commentaries on the theology of St. Anselm, two volumes of miscellanea, and a book to prove that the De Imitatione Christi was by the Benedictine, Jean Gerson. His principal works on philosophy are: *\\"Philosophia Nova-antiqua\\" etc., a defense of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas against their opponents (Salamanca, 1671-2-5, 3 in fol.) *\\"Philosophia Morum\\" etc. (Salamanca, 1677; Rome, 1698), a commentary in four volumes on Aristotle's Ethics. *\\"De virtutibus et vitiis disputationes ethicae in quibus disseritur quidquid spectat ad philosophiam moralem ab Aristotele traditam\\" (Salamanca, 1677; 2d ed. enlarged, Rome, 1697; 3d. ed.

WRCA's programming is also heard on FM translator W291CZ (106.1 MHz) and on the HD2 channel of sister station WBOS. History Logo for the station prior to November 15, 2016 The station began operating as WCRB on January 30, 1948, owned by Theodore Jones's Charles River Broadcasting (hence the WCRB call letters). WCRB was originally a community radio station for Waltham, Massachusetts, before switching to a classical music format a few years later. An FM simulcast was added in 1954, WCRB-FM. As FM broadcasting became more popular for music listening, the AM station ceased simulcasting WCRB-FM's classical format in 1975 and became WHET, programming a big band/adult standards format from 1975 until 1978, and then a short run as a beautiful music outlet. Sales of the station to various owners led to formats such as country music WDLW for most of the 1980s, and then \\"Showbiz Radio\\" WRCA (standing for \\"Radio, Comedy, and Arts\\") in 1990 before the station began leasing time to ethnic broadcasters in 1991 with the WRCA call sign retained. The current owners, the Beasley Broadcast Group, took over in 2000 from the ADD Radio Group. The station's long time transmitter site in Waltham was discontinued in 2007 when WRCA became one of three AM stations to share a rebuilt transmitter facility at the original site of WBOS AM 1600 on Sawmill Brook Parkway in Newton. This site is now used by stations on 1200, 1330 and 1600 kHz. WRCA's city of license changed from Waltham to Watertown in 2007, and the power increased to 25,000 watts daytime, 17,000 watts nighttime. In addition to ethnic programming, WRCA had broadcast Northeastern Huskies men's ice hockey games. Following Beasley's acquisition of Greater Media, WRCA went dark on November 15, 2016, as it moved to new studios; it returned in May 2017 with a simulcast of \\"Boston's Irish Channel\\", the HD2 channel of sister station WBQT, as it was believed that WRCA was in the process of signal testing.

Purpose As industry exploded after the Industrial Revolution certain industries especially in the textiles trade found the need to be able to better predict and set upcoming color and style trends. The Color Association of the United States (CAUS), then the Textile Color Card Association of the United States (TCCA), was formed to accomplish this goal. By implementing a standard, business could then plan upcoming product releases and marketing with better hope of success. Mission #Issue color forecasts in the form of cards twice a year #Give directions in color trends to the market #Enable different segments of the market to coordinate their products by offering the formulas for the production of each forecast color #Buy products worldwide knowing they would coordinate at the point of sale #Serve as an information center for all kinds of color information. The central purpose of setting trends and maintaining color standards is accomplished to this day in part through publication of the \\"Standard Color Reference of America\\", and other swatch books. History Prior to the creation of the TCCA in 1915, later to become The Color Association, hat makers took on the responsibility of color forecasting in the textile industry. Following World War I the information and supplies the milners were using from Europe, especially France, was cut off. Textile manufacturers who had grown dependent of these color decisions decided to form their own committee, the TCCA, which immediately published a Standard Color Card. Early on the TCCA set out to create what they termed \\"staple colors\\" that would facilitate the color coordination and consistency, especially among unrelated trades. By 1930 the TCCA had built close ties to the United States government, especially in the military. The TCCA, under the managing direction of Margaret Hayden Rorke, played a major role in defining the colors and their names for all manner of government related items such as uniforms, ribbons, medals, and flags. For example, the modern Flag of the United States uses specific colors selected and named by the TCCA (Old Glory Red and Old Glory Blue). Through the 1940s and 1950s the TCCA membership increased, including international companies. This expansion led to the creation of industry specific trends and color books sponsored by those industries and more direct consulting to individual companies. To this day CAUS plays a major role in the determining of color trends for industry. Process of creating palettes Many Color Cards or palettes are created for various industries each year. For each area of focus a committee panel is formed, consisting of eight to twelve people, referred in the business as the \\"Color Czars.\\" Each member of the committee performs their own research on what colors they feel will, should, dominate the next few years in that industry. The committee then convenes and they debate the merits of the member selections. In the end they choose 44 colors that will make it to the palette. According to Forecaster Ken Charbonneau, the process is a lot of debate before consensus.

His jersey, number 12, is the only one ever retired by the California Golden Bears football program. Biography A 1973 graduate of Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, Roth led Grossmont College of El Cajon to an undefeated season and state title in 1974, and transferred to University of California, Berkeley in 1975. Originally a back-up, he started the fourth game of the 1975 season, and led the Golden Bears to the Pac-8 title as co-champions. Cal led the nation in total offense, gaining the same yardage both passing and rushing with 2,522 yards each. In 1976, Roth was a pre-season favorite for the Heisman Trophy. The season was more tumultuous, and towards the end of the year Roth's performance started to drop, but he was named an All-American and finished ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting. After the season ended, he revealed that halfway through the season he had been diagnosed with terminal melanomaapparently the metastasis of a mole removed from his face several years earlier. Despite his deteriorating physical condition, he honored his commitments to play in both the Hula Bowl and the Japan Bowl. According to a friend's reminiscence, during the Japan Bowl festivities Roth had agreed to sit for a thirty-minute autograph session; but finding, at the end of the scheduled time, hundreds of children still waiting, he continued to sign until every child had an autograph, after which he left the building and vomited..

Posthumously, Roth received the Berkeley Citation in 1977, awarded to those \\"whose attainments significantly exceed the standards of excellence in their fields and whose contributions to UC Berkeley are manifestly above and beyond the call of duty.\\" In 2000, he was inducted into the University of California Athletic Hall of Fame. Several awards are named for him, including the Joe Roth Award, for the high school player in the San Diego area who best demonstrates courage; the Joe Roth Memorial Award, given to the San Diego County junior college football player who best exemplifies high academic standards and athletic excellence; the Joe Roth Memorial Award, which was given as the MVP award for the Japan Bowl; and the Joe Roth Award, given to the Cal football player who best demonstrates courage, attitude, and sportsmanship. Cal football designates each year's home game against either USC or UCLA as the Joe Roth Memorial Game. Cal wore throwback uniforms similar to those the Bears wore during Roth's career for the 2007 Roth Memorial Game and will continue to do so, starting 2017.

The plant was growing on an open slope amongst high grasses and ferns of the genus Dipteris. The specimen includes a typical pitcher and was chosen as the holotype because the pitchers of this species are its most characteristic feature. Mann and Smith made three further collections of N. sibuyanensis on the same day and at the same altitude. These were sheet 051002, which includes vegetative parts without pitchers, sheet 051003, which consists of fruits, and sheet 051004, which includes male flowers.

It was initially suggested, based on early field observations, that N. sibuyanensis did not produce true upper pitchers and that lower pitchers were almost exclusively produced under moss coverMansell, G. N.d. Nepenthes sibuyanensis in cultivation . Exotica Plants. (the authors of the describing paper mention finding only a single pitcher growing in sunlight). Cultivated plants and subsequent field studies disproved both of these hypotheses. The first use of the name N. sibuyanensis greatly predates the formal description of this species. A certain \\"Nepenthes sibuyanensis Elm.\\" appears in the December 29, 1911 issue of Leaflets of Philippine Botany, in an article by Adolph Daniel Edward Elmer on the figs of Sibuyan. Elmer wrote that this Nepenthes formed part of the summit vegetation of Mount Guiting-Guiting, which was \\"washed down and disseminated as botanical floats\\" along the Pauala River, where he observed it. Description Nepenthes sibuyanensis is a weak climber. The stem can attain a length of 1.5 mMann, P. 1998. A trip to the Philippines. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 27(1): 6‚Äì11. and is up to 8 mm in diameter. Internodes are up to 1.5 cm long and cylindrical in cross section. Leaves are thin-coriaceous and sessile. The lamina is linear-lanceolate to slightly spathulate in shape. It may be up to 18 cm long and 5 cm wide. The lamina has an acute apex and is gradually attenuate towards the base. It is decurrent into a pair of margins that extend for over two-thirds of the internode. Five to six longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Tendrils are usually one to two times as long as the pitchers and up to 9 mm wide near the pitcher. A rare upper pitcher Pitchers arise from the end of the tendril, forming a tightly appressed curve. Lower pitchers are ovate to infundibuliform in shape and may be up to 26 cm high and 15 cm wide. A pair of ribs runs down the front of the pitcher, sometimes bearing fringe elements (‚â§3 mm wide) near the peristome. The pitcher mouth is oval and has an almost horizontal to slightly oblique insertion. The peristome is cylindrical, usually elongated into a short neck, and up to 20 mm wide. It bears a series of ribs (‚â§1 mm high) spaced 2 mm apart. The teeth lining the inner margin of the peristome are up to 4 mm long. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 54% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The glandular region covers the entire inner surface of the pitchers; there is no waxy zone. The glands are up to 0.8 mm in diameter and occur at a density of 200 to 500 per square centimetre. The lid or operculum is broadly ovate-cordate and up to 8 cm long and 6.5 cm wide. It has a rounded apex and lacks appendages. A number of ovate glands (‚â§1 mm in diameter) are concentrated near the centre of the lid's lower surface. A filiform spur (‚â§3 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers are very rarely produced. They are generally smaller and lighter-coloured than their terrestrial counterparts. Nepenthes sibuyanensis has a racemose inflorescence. In male inflorescences, the peduncle reaches a length of at least 18 cm, whereas the rachis is up to 15 cm long. Pedicels are one-flowered, up to 14 mm long, and usually lack bracts. Tepals are oblong, obtuse, and approximately 3 mm long. Stamens are around 5 mm long including the uniseriate anthers. Fruits are up to 22 mm long and bear lanceolate valves (‚â§4 mm wide). Seeds are up to 8 mm long and filiform, although they lack the papery ends typical of most Nepenthes species.Rybka, V., R. Rybkov√° & R. Cantley 2005. Nepenthes argentii on Sibuyan Island. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 34(2): 47‚Äì50. The inflorescence bears a very dense indumentum of adpressed, stellate hairs. The staminal column is covered in short hairs. Vegetative parts of the plant are virtually glabrous. Leaves are yellowish to dark green with a light green midrib. The stem and leaf margins may have reddish highlights. Lower pitchers are yellowish to red, often with scattered red blotches (‚â§10 mm in diameter) below the peristome. The peristome is usually darker than the rest of the pitcher, being dark red to almost black. The lid is yellowish to orange. Upper pitchers are lighter- coloured and usually whitish throughout. Herbarium specimens range in colour from light brown to red. Ecology Nepenthes sibuyanensis is endemic to Sibuyan Island in the Philippines, where it grows on Mount Guiting-Guiting, neighbouring Mount Mayo, as well as the ridge that connects these two mountains. The altitudinal distribution given for this species varies considerably between sources: Vlastik Rybka, Romana Rybkov√° and Rob Cantley give a range of 1200‚Äì1800 m above sea level, while the authors of the describing paper and Stewart McPherson give narrower ranges of 1500‚Äì1800 m and 1250‚Äì1500 m, respectively. According to Rybka, Rybkov√° and Cantley, the species is sympatric with the tiny N. argentii at around 1600‚Äì1770 m.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. A species resembling N. alata grows on Mount Guiting- Guiting at lower elevations of 800‚Äì1000 m; it was described as N. graciliflora by Adolph Daniel Edward Elmer.Elmer, A.D.E. 1912. Nepenthaceae. [pp. 1494‚Äì1496] In: Two score of new plants. Leaflets of Philippine Botany 4: 1475‚Äì1520. Nepenthes armin also occurs on Mt. Guiting-Guiting and on a ridge leading to Mt. Mayo, however it is found at lower elevations and within a more restricted area (750 m). Other plant species endemic to the mountain include Lobelia proctoriiArgent, G., P. Wilkie & D. Madulid 2007. Lobelia proctorii sp. nov. (Lobelioideae, Campanulaceae/Lobeliaceae) from the Philippines. Plant Ecology 192(2): 1385‚Äì0237. and Rhododendron rousei.Argent, G. & D. Madulid 1998. Rhododendron rousei (Ericaceae): a beautiful new species from the Philippines. New Plantsman 5(1): 25‚Äì31. Nepenthes sibuyanensis has no known natural hybrids, although it may hybridise with N. argentii.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Nepenthes sibuyanensis occurs relatively sparsely on open slopes dominated by high grasses, small shrubs, and the fern Dipteris conjugata. Pitchers usually develop embedded in the substrate and are rarely exposed to direct sunlight. Nepenthes sibuyanensis exhibits modified seed morphology owing to its exposed, isolated habitat. The absence of seed wings in this species prevents strong winds carrying them away from suitable habitats and allows for dispersion by water (particularly rainfall and small streams). Due to its localised distribution, the conservation status of N. sibuyanensis is listed as Vulnerable on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Logging and mining operations are increasingly threatening Mount Guiting-Guiting and its national park.Alave, K.L. 2011. Asia's 'Galapagos': Sibuyan Island under threat. Philippine Daily Inquirer, May 21, 2011. Related species Nepenthes sibuyanensis belongs to B. H. Danser's Insignes group, which also includes the closely related Philippine species N. burkei, N. merrilliana, and N. ventricosa, as well as N. insignis from New Guinea.Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. It appears to be intermediate between N. merrilliana and N. ventricosa in terms of both morphology and geographical distribution. In addition, the newly described Nepenthes barcelonae from Luzon has been classified by the authors as a member of this group. The species can be distinguished from both N. burkei and N. ventricosa on the basis of its pitcher shape; the traps of N. sibuyanensis are ovate to slightly infundibulate, whereas those of the latter species are ventricose in the lower part and constricted in the middle. In addition, the pitchers of N. burkei and N. ventricosa are smaller, rarely exceeding 20 cm in height. Nepenthes merrilliana produces the largest pitchers in the Insignes group and, unlike N. sibuyanensis, has two-flowered pedicels. Furthermore, its pitchers bear a pair of well developed fringed wings. Nepenthes sibuyanensis has also been compared to N. insignis. The former produces one-flowered pedicels, whereas those of N. insignis are two-flowered. The pitcher mouth of N. sibuyanensis is almost horizontal, compared to oblique in the latter. In addition, the peristome of N. sibuyanensis forms a short neck, while N. insignis lacks a neck completely. Furthermore, N. insignis has shorter peristome teeth than N. sibuyanensis (1 mm versus 5 mm). The pitchers of N. sibuyanensis also differ in shape, being ovate or slightly infundibulate. Notes :a.The original Latin description of N. sibuyanensis reads: > Folia mediocria sessilia, lamina lineari-lanceolata, nervis longitudinalibus > utrinque 5-6, basi in alas 2 decurrente, vagina 0.; ascidia mediocria v. > maiora, ovata v. infundibuliformia, costis 2 prominentibus, nonnunquam ad os > rudimento alae ciliatae ornatis; peristomio operculum versus acuminato in > collum breve elongato, applanato, 20 mm lato, costis 1.5 - 2 mm distantibus, > dentibus 5 x longioribus quam latis.

Most examples show the bust of the Austrian ruler on the obverse and three or four crowns on the reverse, hence the name which means \\"crown thaler\\" (also Brabanter and crocione (Italian). History The kronenthaler was initially issued with the same weight as the French √©cu at around 29.5 grams, but with a value of 54 sols (stuivers) or 2.7 gulden while the √©cu had a value of 56 sols (stuivers) or 2.8 gulden. French √©cus with 27 grams of fine silver can be theoretically melted and reissued into kronenthalers with 27x = 26 grams of fine silver, matching the silver content of the Reichsthaler of the Leipzig convention. A deliberate minting of below-standard French √©cus, however, also resulted in a decreased silver content for the Kronenthaler. The French annexation of the Southern Netherlands in 1794 resulted in the conversion of Kronenthalers and 6-livre √©cus into new French francs at the rate of 1 franc = 1.0125 livre tournois = 0.16875 √©cu = 4.5 grams fine silver. This implies a fine silver equivalence of 26 grams per √©cu, 25 grams per kronenthaler, and 9 or 9.52 grams per gulden. This reduced-value Belgian gulden doomed the introduction of the 9.61-gram Dutch Gulden as standard currency of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 as the conversion of 2.7-guilder Kronenthalers into 2.7 Dutch guilders was guaranteed.1 franc = 1.0125 livres = 0.16875 √©cu = 0.175 kronenthaler. The conversion 1 franc = 0.4725 Dutch gulden guarantees the value of the kronenthaler at 0.4725/0.175 = 2.7 Dutch gulden or 2.7 Belgian gulden. https://books.google.com/books?id=GrJCAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA353#v=onepage&q;&f;=false At about the same time from 1807-1837, several German states (e.g., Bavaria, Baden, W√ºrttemberg) engaged in a competitive depreciation of the South German gulden by choosing to mint 2.7-gulden Kronenthalers (with 9.52 grams of silver per gulden) rather than the 2.4-gulden Conventionsthaler (with 9.74 grams of silver per gulden).:de:Kronentaler The kronenthaler was minted prolifically in the 19th century precisely because it yielded the issuer the maximum amount of guilders for a fixed quantity of coined silver. The situation was resolved in the Netherlands by reducing the fine silver content of the Dutch gulden to 9.45 grams, and in the Southern German states by adopting a new parity of 1 gulden = Prussian thaler = Cologne mark =9.545 grams of silver as part of the German Customs Union and currency union of 1837. The kronenthaler was thus retired in favor of the new Dutch and South German guilders. The kronenthaler was also the most favorable medium of exchange in Switzerland prior to the adoption of the Swiss franc in 1850. French √©cus accepted at 4 Swiss livres imply a kronenthaler valuation of 4x livres = 3.86 livres. Instead the √©cu de Brabant is accepted at a higher rate of 3.9 livres. The rate of conversion to the new Swiss currency was 5 Swiss francs per kronenthaler.Brabant ecus of 400 rappen (4 old francs) are converted at a rate of 7 old francs for 10 new francs, hence each kronenthaler is 4*10/7 = 40/7 Swiss francs.https://books.google.com/books?id=jfZUAAAAcAAJ&pg;=PA3#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Kronenthaler with 3 crowns in 1797 - Franciscus II References Category:Modern obsolete currencies Category:Currencies of Europe ","title":"Kronenthaler"},{"id":"3790111","text":"Crow Point may refer to * Crow Point in England, at the southern end of Braunton Burrows, on the Taw-Torridge Estuary in North Devon * Crow Point in America, at the entrance to Hingham Harbor, Massachusetts ","title":"Crow Point"},{"id":"3790112","text":"Lewis Landes (December 12, 1891 - January 8, 1972) was a US Army Colonel and a lawyer.

It has seen two editions released, both of which have introduced innovations to Palladium's standard mechanics. A versatile horror-themed game, it lends itself well to wildly different play styles and narrative tones, from schlock splatter-horror to intense psychological horror, with an entire spectrum of terror (humor, or action, etc.) in between. Beyond the Supernatural is implicitly set in the modern day, wherein magic and psychic powers are real and monsters and demonic cults exist, but out of the public eye. This, however, is not set in stone, and most of the character classes are flexible enough to account for variant settings or time periods. 1st edition  The first edition of Beyond the Supernatural, a 255-page book, was published September 1987 as a joint project between Randy McCall and Kevin Siembieda, the president and lead game designer of Palladium Books. In November 1990, Palladium also published the supplement Boxed Nightmares, a collection of adventures as well as a faux tabloid. Much of the art for both titles was created by Kevin Long, although the cover art of the original book was created by Richard Corben. Players could select one of several Psychic Character Classes (P.C.C.s), which determined their abilities. These included Psychic Sensitives, Physical Psychics, Psi-Mechanics (who required devices as crutches to make use of their psychic powers), Arcanists (who had studied magic), Parapsychologists (who had neither psychic nor magical powers, but a great deal of knowledge about both), Nega-Psychics (psychics whose great disbelief in the supernatural actually disrupted its presence), and ordinary people. The system used the then-standard Palladium combat and skills system, including variable educational levels for most characters. Two individuals of the same P.C.C. could have substantially different training backgrounds and skill sets, with one being a doctoral student and another a high-school drop- out, depending either on the roll of the dice or character concept. The first edition's innovation's on Palladium's system was in terms of its supernatural powers. Beyond the Supernatural introduced the concept of Potential Psychic Energy (P.P.E.), which is invested in skills and psychic powers as a person develops, and is used to power magical spells. This replaced the older \\"spells per day\\" system that had been used in earlier versions of the Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game (1983), Heroes Unlimited (1984), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness (1985). Psychic powers were also now organized into the categories of Physical, Healing, and Sensitive, instead of experience levels as they had been previously. Both of these innovations, and the metaphysical underpinnings for them, became standard in Palladium Megaversal games. Reception In the October 1988 edition of Dragon (Issue 138), Ken Rolston found much to like about Beyond the Supernatural, including its similarities to D&D;/AD&D; that would enable new players to quickly adapt to its rules; interesting player-character roles well-designed for co- operative play; and \\"well-developed and well written\\" occult and supernatural settings. However, Rolston criticized the gamemaster notes and sample scenarios, saying that they \\"do nothing to support these virtues, and are particularly inappropriate to the systems, PCs, and campaign background established in the rest of BTS. This flaw compromises what might otherwise have been a solid role-playing package.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"On the basis of the campaign materials alone, this is a very valuable resource for horror/supernatural role-playing game masters. In some ways, it even outshines its competitor, Call of Cthulhu.\\" Boxed Nightmares: Adventure Sourcebook Boxed Nightmares is a collection of horror scenarios/adventures with a faux tabloid for use with Beyond the Supernatural first edition. The book contains a separate sixteen page newspaper players' handout covering the adventures. In November 1990 Palladium published the supplement with much of the art for the titles created by Kevin Long, and cover art of the original book created by Richard Corben. Boxed Nightmares is over eighty pages containing six adventures, three new monsters plus villains, rules for creating secret organizations, the arcanist theif, GM tips, and the newspaper was packaged with the book. 2nd edition Cover of Beyond the Supernatural‚Ñ¢, 2nd Edition, illustrated by John Zeleznik. The second edition of Beyond the Supernatural was released in January 2005 after a lengthy development period. Like its predecessor, it is set in a modern version of Earth, where supernatural forces act out of sight of most of the populace, but may be altered to fit into other time periods or settings. Unlike the first edition, however, it does not have a section on magic nor an extensive bestiary; the two supplements that are to have detailed these aspects were to have immediately followed the core rulebook but have yet to be published. The second edition maintained several things from the first edition. For most characters, education and occupation are still independent of P.C.C., reflecting the more modern and realistic veneer of the setting. All of the previous P.C.C.s, except the Arcanist, returned, and were joined by other P.C.C.s reflecting other aspects of psychic ability, such as the pyrokinetic Firewalker and the Autistic Psychic Savant. Many P.C.C.s were updated, and the idea of purchasing powers directly with P.P.E. was abandoned except in the case of the Psi-Mechanic and Genius/Natural Athlete; additional powers are selected, not purchased. The second edition, however, made some very significant changes to maintain the mystery of the setting, preventing characters from bringing \\"proof\\" of monsters or psychic powers to the world at large. Psychic powers are difficult to recreate under laboratory conditions, and totals of Inner Strength Points (I.S.P.), the \\"fuel\\" for psychic powers, are very small when not under a direct supernatural threat. Furthermore, supernatural creatures dissolve completely when destroyed, leaving nothing behind to be analyzed or photographed.

There are many different colour forms, ranging from green to dark red. This species is known for the two \\"eye spots\\" on the inside surface of its pitchers. The specific epithet reinwardtiana honours Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt. The species has been given the vernacular name Reinwardt's pitcher-plant.Phillipps, A. & A. Lamb 1996. Pitcher-Plants of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Taxonomy and systematics Upper pitchers of a plant identified as N. naquiyuddinii Nepenthes naquiyuddinii Nepenthes naquiyuddinii was described in 2006 by J. H. Adam and Hafiza A. Hamid.Fong, L.F. 2007. New pitcher species . The Star, May 11, 2007. The taxon is only known from Keningau-Kimanis Road and the foot of Mount Trus Madi, both in Sabah, Borneo, where it grows at an elevation of 1400 to 1424 m in open secondary vegetation. Although acknowledging close affinities between N. naquiyuddinii and N. reinwardtiana, Adam and Hafiza stated that the \\"two species exhibit many morphological differences and therefore they cannot be united into the same species\\". However, some authors consider these differences too small for species status and treat N. naquiyuddinii as a heterotypic synonym of N. reinwardtiana.Rice, B.A. 2006. Do you want to tell me about a species I missed? The Carnivorous Plant FAQ.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes naquiyuddinii. Carnivorous Plant Database. Alternatively, N. naquiyuddinii may represent a natural hybrid involving N. fusca and N. reinwardtiana, the only species that are sympatric with it. Phylogeny In 2001, Charles Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon.

It has no official affiliation with the University of California or the official UCLA Alumni Association. It is a private, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2005 by Andrew Jones, who graduated from UCLA in 2003 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and a minor in public policy. Jones runs the organization largely on his own with private donations. The association has gained notoriety for its \\"Exposing UCLA's Radical Professors\\" initiative (UCLAProfs.com), which offered to pay students to inform on faculty \\"actively proselytizing their extreme views in the classroom, whether or not the commentary is relevant to the class topic.\\" The association seeks to tackle what Jones alleges is a strong liberal bias (what he describes as a \\"cancer of political radicalism\\") at UCLA, by soliciting donations from alumni, then using the money to campaign against activist professors, the UCLA Alumni Association and administrators. Although the group says it is concerned about radical professors of any political stripe, in its initial \\"Dirty 30\\" of teachers it names, all are identified only with left-wing or liberal causes. Jones, former chairman of UCLA's Bruin Republicans student group, was a firebrand conservative activist while a student at UCLA, active in Republican causes, and founder of the conservative campus publication The UCLA Criterion. As a student Jones was known as a controversial agitator, gaining notoriety for a 2003 publicity stunt called the \\"Affirmative Action Bake Sale\\" where he offered lower prices on baked goods to minority students, mirroring the preferences inherent in affirmative action itself. As justification for exposing those he considers to be radical professors, Jones says, \\"One aspect of this radicalization, outlined [on the website], is an unholy alliance between anti-war professors, radical Muslim students, and a pliant administration. Working together, they have made UCLA a major organizing center for opposition to the War on Terror.\\" Other issues common to the conservative cause the association finds objectionable are diversity and the related topic, affirmative action. To assist in \\"exposing the most radical professors\\" at UCLA, the association offered students $100 to record classroom lectures of suspect faculty, $50 for notes and materials, and $10 for advisory and all professor-distributed materials. The offer was originally made on the association's website, asking them to report any \\"professor who just can't stop talking about President Bush, about the war in Iraq, about the Republican Party, or any other ideological issue.\\" UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale denounced the campaign as \\"reprehensible\\" and school officials warned that selling, distributing recordings of classroom lectures without an instructor's consent might violate university policy. UCLA spokesman Phil Hampton said the university was sending Jones a letter warning him that faculty hold copyrights to all their course materials and that in their view, his campaign encouraged students to violate school policy and the UCLA Student Code of Conduct. The offer to pay informers was dropped by Jones on January 22, 2006 saying the payment program had become \\"a distraction from the real problem, which is classroom indoctrination by UCLA professors.\\" The association claims to have an advisory council of over 20 members, consisting of conservative activists, scholars ‚Äì including four UCLA professors ‚Äì and which at one time included state Sen. Bill Morrow. News of the campaign prompted former Congressman Jim Rogan, who helped lead the drive for impeachment of former President Bill Clinton in the U.S. House of Representatives, to insist the association not list him as an advisory council member. Rogan says his name was listed without his permission and his contact with the association consisted of one phone conversation. At least two other members of the advisory board have resigned over the group's efforts to have students record their professors. Critics of Jones's website have expressed concern that Jones has not drawn a sharp enough distinction between what so- called \\"radical\\" professors do and say inside the classroom and what they do outside of it, such as signing petitions and engaging in other sorts of political activities. Despite widespread media attention UCLAProfs.com received in early 2006, no professor profiles beyond the initial \\"Dirty 30\\" have ever been added the website.

A few years later, in 1922, the line's name was changed to the Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia Railway and was also known as the TAG Route. The TAG ran from Chattanooga, Tennessee, through northwest Georgia, and into Gadsden, Alabama. The trackage began at Milepost 1 in Alton Park (Chattanooga) and continued southwest to the southern terminus in Gadsden, some 91.7 miles distant. Piers of the Yellow Creek bridge above Lake Weiss During the 1960s the railroad was owned by Mose and Garrison Siskin who owned the Siskin Steel Company in Chattanooga. They used the railroad to move steel products between Siskin Steel and Republic Steel in Gadsden. This made the TAG the only profitable short line railroad in the US during that period. The TAG was purchased by the Southern Railway in 1971. The northernmost 23 miles ending at Kensington, Georgia were operated by the Chattooga and Chickamauga Railway until the Dow Chemical plant in Kensington closed in September 2009.

A saltern is an area or installation for making salt. Salterns include modern salt-making works (saltworks), as well as hypersaline waters that usually contain high concentrations of halophilic microorganisms, primarily haloarchaea but also other halophiles including algae and bacteria. Salterns usually begin with seawater as the initial source of brine but may also use natural saltwater springs and streams. The water is evaporated, usually over a series of ponds, to the point where sodium chloride and other salts precipitate out of the saturated brine, allowing pure salts to be harvested. Where complete evaporation in this fashion was not routinely achievable due to weather, salt was produced from the concentrated brine by boiling the brine. Background Earliest examples of pans used in the solution mining of salt date back to prehistoric times and the pans were made of ceramics known as briquetage. Later examples were made from lead and then iron. The change from lead to iron coincided with a change from wood to coal for the purpose of heating the brine. Brine would be pumped into the pans, and concentrated by the heat of the fire burning underneath. As crystals of salt formed these would be raked out and more brine added. In warmer climates no additional heat would be supplied, the sun's heat being sufficient to evaporate off the brine. One of the earliest salterns for the harvesting of salt is argued to have taken place on Xiechi Lake, Shanxi, China by 6000 BC.

She was laid down in April 1902, was launched in October 1903, and was commissioned in July 1905. Named for the state of Prussia, the ship was armed with a battery of four guns and had a top speed of . Like all pre-dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century, Preussen was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, she saw only limited service with the German fleet. Preussens peacetime career centered on squadron and fleet exercises and training cruises to foreign ports. The ship served as the flagship of II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career. During World War I, she served as a guard ship in the German Bight and later in the Danish straits. She participated in a fleet sortie in December 1914 in support of the Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby during which the German fleet briefly clashed with a detachment of the British Grand Fleet. Preussen had been temporarily assigned to guard ship duties in the Baltic in May 1916, and so missed the Battle of Jutland. Due to her age, she did not rejoin the fleet, and instead continued to serve as a guard ship until 1917, when she became a tender for U-boats based in Wilhelmshaven. After the war, Preussen was retained by the re-formed Reichsmarine and converted into a depot ship for F-type minesweepers. She was stricken from the naval register in April 1929 and sold to ship breakers in 1931. A section of her hull was retained as a target; it was bombed and sunk in 1945 by Allied bombers at the end of World War II, and was scrapped in 1954.  Design  Line-drawing of the Braunschweig class With the passage of the Second Naval Law under the direction of Vizeadmiral (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, Krupp, the supplier of naval artillery to the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) had developed quick- firing, guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the Wittelsbachs. The Design Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from torpedo boats as torpedoes became more effective. Though the Braunschweig class marked a significant improvement over earlier German battleships, its design fell victim to the rapid pace of technological development in the early 1900s. The British battleship ‚Äîarmed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns‚Äîwas commissioned in December 1906, less than a year and a half after Preussen entered service. Dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including Preussen. Preussen was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and at Full load. Her crew consisted of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. Preussens powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of . Preussens armament consisted of a main battery of four 28 cm (11 in) SK L/40 guns in twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns and eighteen 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/35 quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all mounted submerged in the hull. One tube was in the bow, two were on each broadside, and the final tube was in the stern. Preussen was protected with Krupp armor. Her armored belt was thick, the heavier armor in the central portion that protected her magazines and propulsion machinery spaces, and the thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her deck was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.  Service history =Construction through 1907 Preussen was laid down in April 1902 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin under construction number 256. The fourth unit of her class, she had been ordered under the contract name \\"K\\" as a new unit for the fleet. Preussen was launched on 30 October 1903, with a speech given by Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow and the christening performed by Empress Augusta Victoria. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 12 July 1905. Sea trials lasted until September, when she formally joined II Squadron, where she replaced the battleship as the squadron flagship. VAdm Max von Fischel was the squadron commander at the time. A painting of Preussen during gunnery training by Willy St√∂wer in 1906 The German fleet was occupied with extensive training exercises during the early 1900s. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April 1906, the only interruption being in February, when Preussen carried Kaiser Wilhelm II to Copenhagen in company with the light cruiser and the torpedo boats and . Wilhelm II attended the burial of the Danish King Christian IX, who had died the previous month. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic. During Kiel Week on 21 June, Preussen received a gift from the provinces of West Prussia and East Prussia, in the form of a Prussian war flag. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July, and the fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22‚Äì24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernf√∂rde Bay outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days. The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the High Seas Fleet. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August, after which the fleet conducted the annual autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September. The exercises included landing exercises in northern Schleswig with IX Corps. On 1 October 1907, Konteradmiral (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Ludwig von Schr√∂der came aboard Preussen, taking command of the squadron, as Fischel had become the chief of the Marinestation der Nordsee (Naval Station of the North Sea). The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. 1908‚Äì1914 Preussen underway, c. 1908 The fleet conducted training exercises in the Baltic in February 1908. Prince Heinrich, then the commander of the High Seas Fleet, had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic. During the cruise, Preussen visited Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures. In early 1909, Preussen and the battleships and were sent to break paths in the sea ice off the coast of Holstein for merchant shipping. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which Preussen stopped in El Ferrol, Spain. On the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. Later that year, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff became the fleet commander. Holtzendorff's tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from the Baltic Sea port of Kiel to the North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910. I (foreground) and II Squadrons (background) in Kiel In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters there. The annual summer cruise was to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in Danzig on 29 August. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Schr√∂der was promoted to chief of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea), his place aboard Preussen being taken by VAdm Friedrich von Ingenohl. A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In March 1911, the fleet held exercises in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, and the year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. In mid-1912, due to the Agadir Crisis, the summer cruise was confined to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. On 30 January 1913, Holtzendorff was relieved as the fleet commander, owing in large part due to Wilhelm II's displeasure with his strategic vision; Ingenohl took Holtzendorff's place, and KAdm Reinhard Scheer in turn replaced Ingenohl as II Squadron commander on 4 February. In late August, the squadron steamed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal at the start of the autumn maneuvers to reach the island of Helgoland; the voyage through the canal was notable, because the canal had been closed for over a year while it was enlarged to allow the passage of larger dreadnought battleships. Preussen went into dry dock in November for periodic maintenance, and as a result, missed training exercises conducted that month. Preussen participated in ceremonies at Sonderburg on 2 May to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Dybb√∏l of the Second Schleswig War; she was joined by her sister ships and , the battleship , and the armored cruiser . The ship was present during the fleet cruise to Norway in July 1914, which was cut short by the July Crisis following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand the month before and subsequent rise in international tensions. On 25 July the ship's crew was made aware of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia; Preussen left Norway to rendezvous with the rest of the fleet the following day. Preussen had been slated to be decommissioned at the end of the year, her place as the squadron flagship to be taken by the dreadnought . Preussen was to then replace in the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea, but the outbreak of World War I cancelled those plans.  World War I  Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 After the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German command deployed II Squadron in the German Bight to defend Germany's coast from a major attack from the Royal Navy that the Germans presumed was imminent. Preussen and her squadron mates were stationed in the mouth of the Elbe to support the vessels on patrol duty in the Bight. Once it became clear that the British would not attack the High Seas Fleet, the Germans began a series of operations designed to lure out a portion of the numerically superior British Grand Fleet and destroy it. By achieving a rough equality of forces, the German navy could then force a decisive battle in the southern portion of the North Sea. The first such operation in which the High Seas Fleet participated was the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15‚Äì16 December 1914. The main fleet acted as distant support for KAdm Franz von Hipper's battlecruiser squadron while it raided the coastal towns. On the evening of 15 December, the fleet came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl, who was now the German fleet commander, that the entire Grand Fleet was deployed before him. Under orders from Wilhelm II to avoid battle if victory was not certain, Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany. At the end of the month, Scheer was replaced by KAdm Felix Funke, Scheer going on to command III Battle Squadron. On 14 March 1915, Preussen went to Kiel for periodic maintenance, and she was replaced as the squadron flagship by the battleship . The latter vessel held the position for the remainder of the squadron's existence, with the exceptions of 19 September to 16 October 1915, 25 February to 7 April 1916, in September that year, and from 22 January to 10 February 1917; during each of these periods, Preussen temporarily resumed the flagship role. Starting in April 1916, the ships of II Squadron were tasked with patrolling the Danish straits; each ship of the squadron was to rotate through the duty, the others remaining in the Elbe or serving with the main fleet. Preussen began her first stint on 21 April, replacing Hessen; she was accordingly absent during the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft three days later. On 4 May, Preussen was relieved and she returned to the Elbe, though she was transferred back to the straits on 21 May, remaining there until 8 June. As a result, she missed the Battle of Jutland, fought on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June in the North Sea. Her sister ship Lothringen also missed the battle, as she had been deemed to be in too poor a condition to participate in the fleet sortie. Jutland proved to Scheer, who was now the fleet commander, that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable to take part in a major fleet action, and so he detached II Squadron from the High Seas Fleet. As a result, Preussen remained in service only as a guard ship. She saw further stints in the Danish straits from 30 June to 23 July and from 15 to 31 August. On 13 March 1917, Preussen left the Elbe and steamed to the Baltic, where she was temporarily used as an icebreaker to clear a path to Swinem√ºnde. She was decommissioned on 5 August, and most of her crew were transferred to the new battlecruiser . From then to the end of the war, she served as a tender for III U-boat Flotilla based in Wilhelmshaven. Preussen briefly held Edouard Izac, a US Navy sailor captured after his ship was sunk by , in June 1918; Izac would go on to escape from a German prisoner of war camp and win the Medal of Honor.  Post-war career  Preussen after having been converted into a depot ship. Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy was reorganized as the Reichsmarine according to the Treaty of Versailles. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre-dreadnought battleships under Article 181‚Äîtwo of which would be in reserve‚Äîfor coastal defense. Preussen was among those ships chosen to remain on active service with the Reichsmarine. The ship was converted into a parent ship for F-type minesweepers at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven in 1919; the ship was disarmed and platforms for holding the minesweepers were installed. Preussen was commissioned with the Reichsmarine to support the minesweeping effort, though she proved to be too top-heavy to serve as an effective mothership, and she was soon replaced by the old light cruiser . Preussen was placed in reserve and was left out of service until 1929, when she was stricken from the naval register on 5 April. The Reichsmarine sold her to ship breakers on 25 February 1931 for 216,800 Reichsmarks. Preussen was subsequently broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven, though a length of her hull was retained as a testing target for underwater weapons, including torpedoes and mines. The section of hull was nicknamed \\"SMS Vierkant (\\"SMS Rectangle\\"). Allied bombers attacked and sank the section of Preussens hull in April 1945. It was eventually raised and scrapped in late 1954.

Its history may be divided into three general eras. From its inception in 1875 until 1949, the Court served as an intermediate appellate court subject to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain. Following 1949, the Court gained importance and legitimacy as the court of last resort in Canada, establishing a greater role for the Canadian judiciary. In 1982, the introduction of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms significantly changed the role of the Court in Canadian society, by providing the Court with greater powers of oversight over Parliament and through formal recognition of civil rights including aboriginal rights and equality rights. Origins=Confederation During the Confederation conferences leading to the formation of the Dominion of Canada prior to 1867, it was contemplated that a national court of appeal would be created to sit at the top of the Canadian legal hierarchy, especially to deal with disputes between the provinces and Parliament. However, the subject of the court did not generate much interest during the Confederation Debates. There were some concerns over the establishment of general court of appeal. The largely Anglophone population of Canada West (which became the Province of Ontario) wanted continued oversight by the British Privy Council; while the largely Francophone population of Canada East (which became the Province of Quebec) were concerned about the accessibility of appeals involving travel to London, as well as the effect that a supreme court would have on Quebec civil law and Quebec nationalism more generally. Sir John A. Macdonald, first Prime Minister of Canada and an early supporter of the Supreme Court of Canada, c. 1867 The ambivalent attitude toward the court during the Confederation Debates was displayed by John A. Macdonald (then the attorney general of Canada West and who would become the first Prime Minister of Canada), who was a proponent of strong federal institutions including the Supreme Court, when he said: > The Constitution does not provide that such a court shall be established. > There are many arguments for and against the establishment of such a court. > But it was thought wise and expedient to put into the Constitution a power > to the General Legislature, that, if after full consideration they think it > advisable to establish a General Court of Appeal from all the Superior > Courts of all the provinces, they may do so. When the British North America Act, 1867 was finalized, it provided Parliament with the permissive power (\\"may\\") rather than the imperative (\\"shall\\") to create a general court of appeal: > 101\\\\. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, > from Time to Time provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and > Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the > Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the > Laws of Canada.Constitution Act, 1867, s 101. After Confederation in 1867, there was a growing movement to create a final court of appeal for the new country. Nonetheless, it took eight years before the Supreme Court would finally be established due to unresolved tensions between various political factions. Macdonald, along with T√©l√©sphore Fournier, Alexander Mackenzie, and Edward Blake, championed the creation of a Supreme Court. In 1868, Macdonald delegated the task of drafting a bill to establish a supreme court to Henry Strong, and in 1869 a first draft of the legislation was submitted to Parliament. It appears that Macdonald had intended that this bill \\"was rather more for the purpose of suggestion and consideration than for a final measure which [the] Government hoped to become law.\\" Nonetheless, those strongly loyal to the English tradition opposed it and managed to get both the 1869 bill and a revised bill of 1870 withdrawn from Parliament. Additionally, there was resistance from Quebec until the Guibord case demonstrated to them that Privy Council rulings could not always be sensitive to their religious culture. Macdonald's government, however, became preoccupied with other matters and fell in 1873 without further success in establishing a supreme court. Alexander Mackenzie, second Prime Minister of Canada, who oversaw the creation of the Supreme Court in 1875 Establishment of the Court by the Mackenzie Government During the federal election of 1874, the Liberals led by Alexander Mackenzie listed the creation of a central court of appeal as part of their campaign platform. When the Mackenzie government ultimately took power, the issue was again mentioned in the throne speech of 1874. A new Supreme Court Bill was introduced to Parliament by Minister of Justice T√©l√©sphore Fournier in February 1875. On April 8, 1875, The Supreme and Exchequer Court ActThe Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, SC 1875, c 11 [\\"Supreme Court Act, 1875\\"]. passed with bipartisan support, which simultaneously established both the Supreme Court and the Exchequer Court. Initial composition of the Court At the outset, the Supreme Court was to be staffed by six justices. In addition, each of the six justices also sat individually as judges of the newly created Exchequer Court. This arrangement did not change until 1887 when the judges of the two courts were separated by legislative amendment.The Exchequer Court Act, SC 1887, c 16. The selection of the initial members of the Court reflected a desire to establish legitimacy to the public and achieve regional representation across Canada. The Supreme Court Act, 1875 also allocated two of the six positions to Quebec in recognition of the unique civil law system employed by the province.Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss 5 and 6, 2014 SCC 21. Of the seats not reserved for Quebec, Mackenzie would appoint two justices from Ontario, and two from outside central Canada. William Buell Richards, first Chief Justice of Canada To recognize the growing importance of Ontario in the Confederation and to compensate for its acceptance of the same number of seats as Quebec in the newly formed Court, there was pressure to appoint an Ontarian as the Chief Justice. The position was first offered to Edward Blake, a renowned Ontario lawyer and Liberal politician. However, he declined the offer and instead accepted a post in government as the Minister of Justice. William Buell Richards, the chief justice of Ontario and formerly the attorney-general of Canada West, was ultimately appointed as Chief Justice. Samuel Henry Strong, who helped draft the 1869 proposal and was a judge on the Ontario Supreme Court, filled the other seat for Ontario. The Quebec positions were filled by T√©l√©sphore Fournier, the Minister of Justice who introduced the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, 1875, and Jean-Thomas Taschereau, a judge of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench. The remaining two seats went to William Johnston Ritchie, chief justice of New Brunswick, and William Alexander Henry, a former Nova Scotia MLA who lost his seat for his role as a Father of Confederation. The average age of the first six members of the Court was fifty-seven years, which would in fact be one of the youngest benches in the history of the Court. Public reaction to the appointments were mixed, especially in Montr√©al, where the press raised concerns about the structure of the Court and the lack of commercial experience of the civil law jurists (both of whom were from the Quebec City area, leaving Montr√©al, then the largest city in Canada, unrepresented). The six member structure of the Court inevitably resulted in several even split decisions, and it was eventually increased to seven in 1927. In 1949, with the abolition of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the complement of judges was increased again to nine. First cases of the Court The court was inaugurated on November 18, 1875. However, there was a paucity of appeals to the Court in its first year. Thus, on the first sitting of the Court on Monday, January 17, 1876, the Court adjourned immediately as there was no case before the bench. That April the Court was given a reference question from the Canadian Senate (in Re \\"The Brothers of the Christian Schools in Canada\\"). The Senate asked the Court if a bill entitled \\"An Act to incorporate the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Canada\\" was within the authority of the federal government to enact. Only four Justices were in attendance. Justices Ritchie, Strong, and Fournier held, without providing reasons, that the bill was within exclusive provincial authority. Chief Justice Richards abstained, expressing doubts as to whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear references of private members' bills. It was not until June 1876 that the Court heard its first case with Kelly v. Sulivan (which was given the court file number one). Location of the Court Interior of Supreme Court courtroom Old Supreme Court building on southwest corner of West Block For its first five years of existence, the Court moved around among various vacant rooms in the Parliament buildings, including most notably the Railway Committee Room. Permanent accommodations were not provided until 1882, when they moved into a refurbished building on the southwest corner of the West Block of Parliament Hill (facing Bank Street). The building was originally designed by Thomas Seaton Scott, Chief Dominion Architect, and was constructed in 1873 as workshops and stables for the government. It was renovated with a design by Thomas Fuller in 1881 for the Supreme Court, which shared the building for six years with the National Art Gallery. However, complaints were lodged against the building by its occupants, listing problems such as a pervasive \\"dreadful smell\\", poor ventilation, small space, lack of offices, and distance to the parliamentary library. In 1890, a new wing extending North of the building was constructed providing a basement, two additional storeys, and an attic, which nearly doubled the size of the courthouse facilities. The Court occupied this building until 1949, when they moved into a purpose-built building on Wellington Street, west of Parliament. Under the Privy Council (1875‚Äì1949) In the early days all cases could be appealed from the Supreme Court of Canada to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. As well, cases could bypass the Supreme Court and go directly to London from the provincial courts of appeal. The decisions of the Supreme Court on the interpretation of the Constitution tended to support the popular view that it was intended to create a powerful central government. The Privy Council, however, held a distinctly opposite view of the Constitution as providing for strong provincial powers . The decisions of Lords Haldane and Watson strongly reflected this view in their decisions which became increasingly unpopular. In many of their decisions they interpreted the Trade and Commerce power as well as the peace, order and good government power of the federal government to be exceptionally limited. Many of these decisions had the result of striking down a number of reforms proposed by both the Conservative Government of R. B. Bennett and the following Liberal government of MacKenzie King, despite public support. Consequently, provincial governments began to demand the federal government press the United Kingdom for judicial independence. The Supreme Court of Canada formally became the court of last resort for criminal appeals in 1933 and for all other appeals in 1949. The last Canadian case heard by the Privy Council was in 1959, as the case had been grandfathered. Independence as court of last resort (1949‚Äì1982)=Laskin Court The appointment of Bora Laskin as Chief Justice in 1973 represented a major turning point for the Supreme Court. Many of the Laskin Court justices were either academics or well-respected practitioners, most had several years experience in appellate courts. Laskin's federalist and liberal views were an influence in many of the court's decisions. The change in direction of the court proved somewhat controversial. Laskin's style was abrasive enough that it provoked Justice Louis-Philippe de Grandpr√© to take early retirement. His promotion to Chief Justice also upset Ronald Martland, who by convention expected to be appointed to the position since he was the most senior puisne justice at the time. Among the most notable cases to go through the court in this period included Calder v British Columbia (AG) [1973] SCR 313 where the court acknowledged the existence of a free-standing aboriginal right to land. In R v Sault Ste-Marie (City of) [1978] 2 SCR 1299, the court established the standard for strict liability offences in the criminal law. Reference re a Resolution to amend the Constitution [1981] 1 SCR 753 (\\"Patriation Reference\\") was one of the first times the court acknowledged the existence of an unwritten constitutional convention, namely the constitutional obligation to get consent from the provinces for an amendment.  Charter era (1982-present) =Dickson Court The beginning of the Dickson Court corresponds to the first of the Charter cases heard by the Supreme Court. The Dickson Court oversaw some of the most fundamental changes in Canadian jurisprudence. The court decided many foundational cases for Charter jurisprudence, including R v Oakes (section 1) and Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Local 580 v Dolphin Delivery Ltd (scope of the Charter). Among the most radical decisions of this period include Re BC Motor Vehicle Act, which broke away from the conventional wisdom that due process only protected procedural rights by including substantive rights as well. This case was later followed up with the decision of R v Morgentaler, which proved significant both because it struck down the criminalization of abortion but also because of its expansion of due process rights into the civil context. The Dickson Court era also saw the beginning of a major shift in Canadian administrative law, with the \\"pragmatic and functional approach\\" appearing in Union des Employes de Service, Local 298 v Bibeault. The last years of the Dickson Court saw an entire revision of the area of conflict of laws by Justice G√©rard La Forest in the decisions of Morguard Investments Ltd v De Savoye [1990] 3 SCR 1077. This would continue in the Lamer Court era with subsequent decisions such as Hunt v T&N; plc, [1993] 4 SCR 289 and Tolofson v Jensen, [1994] 3 SCR 1022. Lamer Court Antonio Lamer's criminal law background proved an influence on the number of criminal cases heard by the court during his time as Chief Justice. McLachlin Court The appointment of Beverly McLachlin as Chief Justice has resulted in a more centrist and unified court.

It was built as part of the Kaipara-Riverhead Railway, which was isolated from the national railway network until 1881, just before closure of this section. Construction The Kaipara-Riverhead Railway was built to link the eastern WaitematƒÅ Harbour at Riverhead with the western Kaipara Harbour at Helensville South, to provide more convenient access between the northern districts and Auckland and to improve export prospects for the timber industry in the Kaipara area. The first sod was turned on 31 August 1871 by the Auckland Provincial Council, but at the start of 1872 the national government took over the job. The railway was only 25 km long, and specific delays with acquiring rails and the general difficulties associated with the relative isolation of the time meant that construction dragged on for a few years. On 29 October 1875, it finally opened. Brief operation and closure The section had no intermediate stations, and operated for slightly less than six years. Construction of the North Auckland Line was proceeding steadily, and on 13 July 1881 it reached Kume≈´ from Auckland. The Kumeu- Riverhead section became the Riverhead branch, with Kume≈´ as a junction, but it did not last even a week. Between Kume≈´ and Auckland the North Auckland Line was far superior to shipping, so the Riverhead branch closed on 18 July 1881. The line today Despite the line being closed for nearly a century and a half, some faint remnants still exist. The embankment on which it left Kume≈´ diverges from the North Auckland Line near the Kumeu River Number 1 bridge. Old Railway Road is on the formation of the line, and at the T-intersection with State Highway 16 the road ends and the formation continues straight ahead. At Riverhead no substantial relics remain.

The film, based on a true French murder case in 1933, is about an eighteen-year-old girl named Violette and her encounters with a number of older men. The film had a total of 1,074,507 admissions in France. Plot Violette Nozi√®re (Isabelle Huppert) is a French teen in the 1930s who secretly works as a prostitute while living with her unsuspecting parents, father Baptiste Nozi√®re (Jean Carmet) and mother Germaine Nozi√®re (St√©phane Audran). Rebelling against her \\"mean and petty\\" petit-bourgeois parents, she falls in love with a spendthrift young man, whom she virtually supports with thefts from her parents as well as her prostitution earnings. Meanwhile, her parents are informed by Violette's doctor that she has syphilis. Violette manages to half-persuade her suspicious mother and indulgent father that she has somehow inherited the disease from them. On this pretext, she tricks them into taking \\"medicine\\" that is actually poison, killing her father; her mother, however, survives, and Violette is arrested and charged with murder. She defends herself by alleging that her father had molested her; Chabrol's abrupt use of flashbacks makes it uncertain whether Violette is simply lying or telling a half-truth. She is convicted of murder and sentenced to die by guillotine, but a voiceover at the end tells us that her sentence was commuted by degrees to the point that she ultimately left prison, married, and had five children.

It operates various train routes across South Africa, carrying approximately 4 million passengers annually. Before 2009, Shosholoza Meyl was a division of Spoornet, but it was transferred after the formation of PRASA. \\"Shosholoza\\" is the name of a popular South African song about workers on a train and it therefore means moving forward. \\"Meyl\\" is a word that is related to a South African word for \\"long distance train\\", according to the Spoornet/Shosholoza Meyl website. The company's name prior to change was \\"Mainline Passenger Services\\". In August 2010, Shosholoza Meyl suspended services claiming either contract difficulties (between Transnet and Prasa) or unreliable trains. Some services began to resume in November 2010.

The book is set in her Saga of the Skolian Empire. It won the 2001 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 2001 Affaire de Coeur Award for Best Science Fiction.Spectrum Literary Agency The first third of the novel appeared as a three-part serialization in Analog magazine in the 1999 May, June and July/August issues. Tor Books published the full novel in 2000. Plot summary The Quantum Rose is a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast folktale in a science fiction setting. In the novel, Kamoj Argali, the governor of an impoverished province on the backward planet Balumil, is betrothed to Jax Ironbridge, ruler of a wealthy neighboring province, an arrangement made for political purposes to save her province from starvation and death. Havyrl (Vyrl) Lionstar, a prince of the titular Ruby Dynasty, comes to Balimul as part of a governmental plan to deal with the aftermath of an interstellar war. Masked and enigmatic, he has a reputation as a monster with Kamoj's people. Lionstar interferes with Kamoj's culture and destabilizes their government by pushing her into marriage with himself. In the traditional fairy tale, Belle must save her father from the prince transformed into a beast; in The Quantum Rose, Kamoj must save her province from the prince in exile. The book deals with themes about the physical and emotional scars left on the survivors of a war with no clear victor. As such, it is also a story of healing for the characters Kamoj and Lionstar.Review at magazine Challenging Destiny The second half of The Quantum Rose involves Lionstar's return to his home world with Kamoj, where he becomes the central figure in a planet wide act of civil disobedience designed to eject an occupying military force that has taken control of his planet. Both the world Balimul in the first half of the novel and the world Lyshriol in the second half fall into the lost colony genre of literature in science fiction. Context The Quantum Rose is an allegory to the mathematical and physical processes of coupled-channel quantum scattering theory and as such is based on Asaro's doctoral work in chemical physics, with thesis advisor Alexander Dalgarno at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Asaro describes the allegory in an essay at the end of the book and explains how the characters and plot points play the roles of mathematical terms or processes in atomic and molecular physics. Each chapter of the book has a main poetic title, and then a subtitle which refers to the aspect of scattering theory highlighted in that chapter. In an interview with The Hachiko, Asaro describes how she used the provocative nature of some scientific terminology to evoke conflicts dealt with in the book, such as the tensions between capture and freedom.Thehachiko.com She discusses some of her inspiration for the book in \\"Moments of Genius,\\" an interview at the Intel Big Think website.Moments of Genius This book overlaps with Spherical Harmonic, which tells the story of Ruby Pharaoh and her attempts to regain her title after the devastating Radiance War. Reception Locus reviewer Jennifer Hall received the novel favorably, saying \\"The writing is strong and the plot and characters engaging, and [Asaro] hold[s] it all together with a complexity of situations, scientific marvels, and loads of intrigue.\\"\\"Locus Looks at Books: Reviews by Divers Hands\\", Locus, December 2000, p.29 Jeri Wright, in a Featured Review for SF Site, gave a highly favorable review of the book, calling it \\"thought- provoking, entertaining, and very, very enjoyable\\", and commending Asaro for her \\"interesting scientific and cultural speculation\\".SFSite Review.

A megamaser is a type of astrophysical maser, which is a naturally occurring source of stimulated spectral line emission. Megamasers are distinguished from astrophysical masers by their large isotropic luminosity. Megamasers have typical luminosities of 103 solar luminosities (), which is 100 million times brighter than masers in the Milky Way, hence the prefix mega. Likewise, the term kilomaser is used to describe masers outside the Milky Way that have luminosities of order , or thousands of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, gigamaser is used to describe masers billions of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way, and extragalactic maser encompasses all masers found outside the Milky Way. Most known extragalactic masers are megamasers, and the majority of megamasers are hydroxyl (OH) megamasers, meaning the spectral line being amplified is one due to a transition in the hydroxyl molecule. There are known megamasers for three other molecules: water (H2O), formaldehyde (H2CO), and methine (CH). Water megamasers were the first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first hydroxyl megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, and there are a small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The population inversion in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re- emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust. Zeeman splitting of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way. Water megamasers and kilomasers are found primarily associated with active galactic nuclei, while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers are found in star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers do not seem to be very different from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to galaxies in order to provide constraints on the Hubble constant. Background=Masers Diagram showing the process of stimulated emission The word maser derives from the acronym MASER, which stands for \\"Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\\". The maser is a predecessor to lasers, which operate at optical wavelengths, and is named by the replacement of \\"microwave\\" with \\"light\\". Given a system of atoms or molecules, each with different energy states, an atom or molecule may absorb a photon and move to a higher energy level, or the photon may stimulate emission of another photon of the same energy and cause a transition to a lower energy level. Producing a maser requires population inversion, which is when a system has more members in a higher energy level relative to a lower energy level. In such a situation, more photons will be produced by stimulated emission than will be absorbed. Such a system is not in thermal equilibrium, and as such requires special conditions to occur. Specifically, it must have some energy source that can pump the atoms or molecules to the excited state. Once population inversion occurs, a photon with a photon energy corresponding to the energy difference between two states can then produce stimulated emission of another photon of the same energy. The atom or molecule will drop to the lower energy level, and there will be two photons of the same energy, where before there was only one. The repetition of this process is what leads to amplification, and since all of the photons are the same energy, the light produced is monochromatic.Griffiths (2005), pp. 350‚Äì351. Astrophysical masers Masers and lasers built on Earth and masers that occur in space both require population inversion in order to operate, but the conditions under which population inversion occurs are very different in the two cases. Masers in laboratories have systems with high densities, which limits the transitions that may be used for masing, and requires using a resonant cavity in order to bounce light back and forth many times. Astrophysical masers are at low densities, and naturally have very long path lengths. At low densities, being out of thermal equilibrium is more easily achieved because thermal equilibrium is maintained by collisions, meaning population inversion can occur. Long path lengths provide photons traveling through the medium many opportunities to stimulate emission, and produce amplification of a background source of radiation. These factors accumulate to \\"make interstellar space a natural environment for maser operation.\\"Elitzur (1992), pp. 56‚Äì58. Astrophysical masers may be pumped either radiatively or collisionally. In radiative pumping, infrared photons with higher energies than the maser transition photons preferentially excite atoms and molecules to the upper state in the maser in order to produce population inversion. In collisional pumping, this population inversion is instead produced by collisions that excite molecules to energy levels above that of the upper maser level, and then the molecule decays to the upper maser level by emitting photons.Lo (2005), pp. 628‚Äì629. History In 1965, twelve years after the first maser was built in a laboratory, a hydroxyl (OH) maser was discovered in the plane of the Milky Way.Weaver et al. (1965) Masers of other molecules were discovered in the Milky Way in the following years, including water (H2O), silicon monoxide (SiO), and methanol (CH3OH).Reid and Moran (1981) The typical isotropic luminosity for these galactic masers is .Moran (1976) The first evidence for extragalactic masing was detection of the hydroxyl molecule in NGC 253 in 1973, and was roughly ten times more luminous than galactic masers.Elitzur (1992), p. 308. In 1982, the first megamaser was discovered in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220.Baan, Wood, and Haschick (1982) The luminosity of the source, assuming it emits isotropically, is roughly . This luminosity is roughly one hundred million times stronger than the typical maser found in the Milky Way, and so the maser source in Arp 220 was called a megamaser.Baan and Haschick (1984) At this time, extragalactic water (H2O) masers were already known. In 1984, water maser emission was discovered in NGC 4258 and NGC 1068 that was of comparable strength to the hydroxyl maser in Arp 220, and are as such considered water megamasers.Elitzur (1992), p. 315. Over the next decade, megamasers were also discovered for formaldehyde (H2CO) and methine (CH). Galactic formaldehyde masers are relatively rare, and more formaldehyde megamasers are known than are galactic formaldehyde masers. Methine masers, on the other hand, are quite common in the Milky Way. Both types of megamaser were found in galaxies in which hydroxyl had been detected. Methine is seen in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption, while formaldehyde is found in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption as well as those with hydroxyl megamaser emission.Baan (1993) As of 2007, 109 hydroxyl megamaser sources were known, up to a redshift of z \\\\approx 0.27.Chen, Shan, and Gao (2007) Over 100 extragalactic water masers are known, and of these, 65 are bright enough to be considered megamasers.Lo (2005), p. 668. General requirements Galaxies MCG+01-38-004 (upper) and MCG+01-38-005 (lower) ‚Äì the microwave emissions from MCG+01-38-005 were used to calculate a refined value for the Hubble constant. Regardless of the masing molecule, there are a few requirements that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place.Baan (1993), pp. 80‚Äì81. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by the fact that there is no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually. Hydroxyl megamasers Arp 220 hosts the first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy, and has been studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this reason, it is the prototype of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies, and is often used as a guide for interpreting other hydroxyl megamasers and their hosts.Elitzur (1992), pp. 308‚Äì310. Hosts and environment Arp 220, the prototypical hydroxyl megamaser host galaxy Hydroxyl megamasers are found in the nuclear region of a class of galaxies called luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), with far infrared luminosities in excess of one hundred billion solar luminosities, or LFIR > , and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with LFIR > are favored.Darling and Giovanelli (2002), p. 115 These infrared luminosities are very large, but in many cases LIRGs are not particularly luminous in visible light. For instance, the ratio of infrared luminosity to luminosity in blue light is roughly 80 for Arp 220, the first source in which a megamaser was observed.Elitzur (1992), p. 309. The majority of the LIRGs show evidence of interaction with other galaxies or having recently experienced a galaxy merger,Andreasian and Alloin (1994) and the same holds true for the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers.Darling and Giovanelli (2002), pp. 115‚Äì116. Megamaser hosts are rich in molecular gas compared to spiral galaxies, with molecular hydrogen masses in excess of one billion solar masses, or H2 > .Burdyuzha and Vikulov (1990), p. 86. Mergers help funnel molecular gas to the nuclear region of the LIRG, producing high molecular densities and stimulating high star formation rates characteristic of LIRGs. The starlight in turn heats dust, which re-radiates in the far infrared and produces the high LFIR observed in hydroxyl megamaser hosts.Darling and Giovanelli (2002), p. 116Mirabel and Sanders (1987) The dust temperatures derived from far infrared fluxes are warm relative to spirals, ranging from 40‚Äì90 K.Lockett and Elitzur (2008), p. 986. The far infrared luminosity and dust temperature of a LIRG both affect the likelihood of hosting an hydroxyl megamaser, through correlations between the dust temperature and far infrared luminosity, so it is unclear from observations alone what the role of each is in producing hydroxyl megamasers. LIRGs with warmer dust are more likely to host hydroxyl megamasers, as are ULIRGs, with LFIR > . At least one out of three ULIRGs hosts an hydroxyl megamaser, as compared with roughly one out of six LIRGs.Darling and Giovanelli (2002), pp. 117‚Äì118. Early observations of hydroxyl megamasers indicated a correlation between the isotropic hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity, with LOH \\\\propto LFIR2.Baan (1989) As more hydroxyl megamasers were discovered, and care was taken to account for the Malmquist bias, this observed relationship was found to be flatter, with LOH \\\\propto LFIR1.2\\\\pm0.1.Darling and Giovanelli (2002), pp. 118‚Äì120. Early spectral classification of the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers indicated that the properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are classified as starburst galaxies, one quarter are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different.Darling and Giovanelli (2006) Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10‚Äì25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50‚Äì95% for non- masing LIRGs.Willett et al. (2011) The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers may be distinguished from the general population of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000 cm‚àí3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).Darling (2007) Line characteristics The 1665 and 1667 MHz maser lines in Arp 220, which have been redshifted to lower frequencies The emission of hydroxyl megamasers occurs predominantly in the so-called \\"main lines\\" at 1665 and 1667 MHz. The hydroxyl molecule also has two \\"satellite lines\\" that emit at 1612 and 1720 MHz, but few hydroxyl megamasers have had satellite lines detected. Emission in all known hydroxyl megamasers is stronger in the 1667 MHz line; typical ratios of the flux in the 1667 MHz line to the 1665 MHz line, called the hyperfine ratio, range from a minimum of 2 to greater than 20.Randell et al. (1995), p. 660. For hydroxyl emitting in thermodynamic equilibrium, this ratio will range from 1.8 to 1, depending upon the optical depth, so line ratios greater than 2 are indicative of a population out of thermal equilibrium.Baan, Wood, and Haschick (1982), p. L51. This may be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers in star-forming regions, where the 1665 MHz line is typically strongest, and hydroxyl masers around evolved stars, in which the 1612 MHz line is often strongest, and of the main lines, 1667 MHz emission is frequently stronger than 1612 MHz.Reid and Moran (1981), pp. 247‚Äì251. The total width of emission at a given frequency is typically many hundreds of kilometers per second, and individual features that make up the total emission profile have widths ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers per second. These may also be compared with galactic hydroxyl masers, which typically have linewidths of order a kilometer per second or narrower, and are spread over a velocity of a few to tens of kilometers per second. The radiation amplified by hydroxyl masers is the radio continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of synchrotron radiation produced by Type II supernovae.Baan and Klockner (2006), p. 559. Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or gains, ranging from a few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.Baan (1993), pp. 74‚Äì76. A few hydroxyl megamasers, including Arp 220, have been observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics are similar to those seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds, high ratios of flux at 1667 MHz to flux at 1665 MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second.Lonsdale et al. (1998)Diamond et al. (1999) These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission.Parra et al. (2005) The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.Parra et al. (2005), p. 394. Pumping mechanism The observed relationship between the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped. Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present a problem with this model for compact emission components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism.Lonsdale et al. (1998), pp. L15‚ÄìL16. However, a model of maser emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl emission.Lockett and Elitzur (2008), p. 985. A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 micrometres are the primary pump for main line maser emission, and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 kelvins.Lockett and Elitzur (2008), p. 991. Recent observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope confirm this basic picture, but there are still some discrepancies between details of the model and observations of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust opacity for megamaser emission. Applications Hydroxyl megamasers occur in the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and appear to be a marker in the stage of the formation of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place.Darling (2005), p. 217. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers.Burdyuzha and Komberg (1990) Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in these objects.Lo (2005), pp. 656‚Äì657. The first detection of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers.Robishaw, Quataert, and Heiles (2008), p. 981. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line due to the presence of a magnetic field, and the size of the splitting is linearly proportional to the line-of-sight magnetic field strength. Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.Robishaw, Quataert, and Heiles (2008) Water megamasers Whereas hydroxyl megamasers seem to be fundamentally distinct in some ways from galactic hydroxyl masers, water megamasers do not seem to require conditions too dissimilar from galactic water masers. Water masers stronger than galactic water masers, some of which are strong enough to be classified \\"mega\\" masers, may be described by the same luminosity function as galactic water masers. Some extragalactic water masers occur in star forming regions, like galactic water masers, while stronger water masers are found in the circumnuclear regions around active galactic nuclei (AGN). The isotropic luminosities of these span a range of order one to a few hundred , and are found in nearby galaxies like Messier 51 () and more distant galaxies like NGC 4258 ().Elitzur (1992), pp. 314‚Äì316. Line characteristics and pumping mechanism Water maser emission is observed primarily at 22 GHz, due to a transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm‚àí3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm‚àí3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region.Lo (2005), pp. 629‚Äì630. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the interstellar medium. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.Elitzur, Hollenbach, & McKee (1989) Applications Water megamasers may be used to provide accurate distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths.Herrnstein et al. (1999) This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow.Reid et al. (2009) This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.Kuo et al.

The book is an account of oral folklore collected in Georgia from African Americans, namely the Gullah people of the Sea Islands, many of whom had been slaves. The main focus of the book is the set of beliefs gathered from these people, much of which today falls under the category of Hoodoo, including spirits, talismans, lucky and unlucky actions and omens. It also examines the use of drums and dancing during celebrations, funerals and baptisms, as well as other aspects of their folklore. Quotes from the interviewees are recorded in dialect. Granger uses the information gathered, both from the former slaves interviewed and from African ethnographers and folklore-experts, to conclude that these beliefs originated in Africa. The publishing of the book was done through the Savannah Unit of the Georgia branch of the Federal Writers' Project, of which Granger was a District Supervisor. The copyright has not been renewed, and the work is now in the public domain.

It is situated one mile (1.6 km) west of Dunfermline, east of Cairneyhill, astride the A994 (Main Street), at . The village has mixed housing with large housing estates on the southwest and northwest ends. Most residents work either locally or commute to Edinburgh or Glasgow. It is two miles (3.2 km) north of the Firth of Forth and seventeen miles (27 km) from Edinburgh. The village sits on the main bus route X24, X26, X27 from Fife to Central Glasgow's Buchanan Bus Station. Bus routes 8 and 9 go to High Vallyfield and Stirling. Bus route 89 goes to St Margarets Hospital in Dunfermline and then to North Queensferry. Dunfermline Town rail station is 2.5 miles (4 km) away. Local facilities Crossford Main Street looking west on a cold morning in March 2006 School and community Crossford Primary School was built in 1973 replacing the old school that was located on the North side of the A994 half way between Cairneyhill and Crossford. The school has ten teaching areas in a semi-open plan arrangement, plus a separate nursery class. There is a grass playing field for football and other sports. At the park there is a Scout hall (with Scouts and Girl Guides held weekly). On the Main Street, the Village Hall is used by a variety of organisations including; Crossford Playgroup, Crossford Ladies Group, SWRI, Zumba classes, religious meetings, Crossford Community Council. The highlights of the social year in Crossford are probably the Children's Gala events held over the year to raise funds for the November Fireworks and the Gala Week, with daily events, each June. The Children's Gala has been held since 1955 and is organised by the Crossford Gala Committee for children from the village. Businesses and employment Businesses in the village include: Pharmacy and Post Office, supermarket (Co-operative), bakers (Stephens), hairdresser (Scissors), beauty salon (Aura), chip shop (Masterchef), with garage (D&G; Autocare), fireplace sales (A.H Fireplace Installations) situated to the east. The Adamson Hotel formerly known as The Pitfirrane Hotel is in the centre of the village and is one of the few original Coaching Inns left in Scotland. The Keavil House Hotel stands in of grounds to the west of Crossford and its meeting facilities, restaurant and health club with swimming pool are an amenity for the village and surrounding area. Sport Crossford boasts the King George V Memorial Park playing fields, opened in 1950 by the Countess of Elgin. The land was gifted by the Halkett family of the Pitfirrane Estate. The community itself paid for the establishing of the facilities together with a Major Fiddes of the National Playing Fields Association. New sports facilities in King George V Memorial Park were unveiled on 8 May 2005. The floodlit, all-weather multi court was proposed by Crossford Recreation and the Environment, and will be used by schools and the community for five-a-side football, tennis, basketball, hockey and netball. To the southeast of Crossford the Dunfermline Golf Club has an 18-hole golf course. The Halkett family owned the Pitfirrane Estate until 1951, living in the Pitfirrane Castle which has become the clubhouse. Crossford is an ideal centre for walking. Numerous pathways radiate from the village, to Dean Woods and Milesmark in the north, to Pitliver and Limekilns/Charlestown in the south, to Cairneyhill in the west and to Pittencrieff Park at Dunfermline, in the east. To the north of the village, near Dean Woods, there is a paved cycle track which extends from Dunfermline to Clackmannan. History Crossford can trace its history back into the distant past with Bronze Age discoveries having been made on Craigs Farm indicating agricultural activity into antiquity. Crossford is said to take its name from the ford crossed by monks on their way between the abbeys of Dunfermline and Culross. and together with the early agricultural activity this seems to form the main part of the activity in the village. In the 16th century the village found a new life as coal and ironstone were mined from the lands of Pitfirrane under a charter granted to the Lairds of Pitfirrane (the Halkett family) by Queen Mary. The produce of this activity was then transported down the Waggon Road to Limekilns for shipping via the port there. The Halketts enjoyed a privilege to ship free of duty to all foreign lands until 1788 when the government purchased the right for ¬£40,000. The uppermost 4 inches and lowermost 2 inches of ironstone were said to be of such high quality as to be suitable for the making of cannon, and the produce was shipped to the Carron Company ironworks for that purpose. The introduction of the Turnpike Act in 1796 brought about the installation of a tollbar on the Waggon Road. The building housing this still exists on the crossroads in the centre of the village. At the beginning of the 19th century, it is recorded that some 50 handlooms were in use in the village with a population of 380 persons. This follows a pattern in the area for such weaving communities, another example being Gowkhall a few miles North. The Earls of Elgin owned land in the Crossford area in connection with the Elgin Colliery (at Parkneuk and Baldridge Burn, northwest of Dunfermline) and the Elgin Railway that ran from the colliery round Crossford and then down beside Waggon Road and on to Charlestown harbour. The route of the railway and the site of the Elgin Colliery are shown in a map in Chalmers' book, Historical and Statistical Account of Dunfermline.Rev. Peter Chalmers, Historical and Statistical Account of Dunfermline, Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1846, Plate I. Photographs are available online of where the railway was.See this RailScot website: http://www.railbrit.co.uk/location.php?loc=Elgin%20Railway Retrieved 2012-02-28 An 1856 map shows a brewery at the west end of the village, and whinstone quarry to the north of the main road. During World War I the modern day Keavil House Hotel was used by the Admiralty as a location to base high- ranking officers, the naval base at Rosyth (Rosyth Dockyard) being of a much greater size and importance at the time. During 1917 the First Sea Lord, Prince Louis of Battenburg and his son (Earl Mountbatten of Burma) were in residence when their names were officially changed to Mountbatten in order to reduce the Germanic image. This was very common in the UK at the time given the situation of total war being prosecuted against Germany. Prince Louis wrote in the visitors' book at Keavil \\"July 9th: arrived Prince Hyde.

Responsibility shifted between the newly formed Fife Regional Council and Dunfermline District Councils before being sold privately and renovated as a hotel in 1978/9. Crossford also boasts the Pitfirrane Castle, a 16th-century 4 storey Towerhouse. In modern times this has become home to the Dunfermline Golf Club. The building has been modified and extended in recent years, but still maintains some impressive stained glass and much of its original stature. Nature The land around Crossford is fertile and sought after for agriculture. There is a designated Green Belt at the southeast of the village, between Waggon Road and Dunfermline which attracts a variety of birdlife; pheasant, wild geese, curlew, heron, et cetera. On the southwest corner, near Keavil Steadings, is the Crossford sycamore, of about 300 years ‚Äî a significant heritage tree which is recorded in the veteran tree register. The Crossford Burn comes from the Dean Wood, in the north and travels through the village to join the Lyne Burn near the railway at the south. Land to the south of the village is of high risk to river flooding.

The region around Riverhead and the neighbouring towns of Kumeu and Huapai is known for its vineyards. This town has had its 15 minutes in the spotlight appearing in movies Bridge to TeribithiaFilming locations for Bridge to Terabithia and Crooked Earth and the odd television show such as Outrageous Fortune. Riverhead was briefly a railway terminus in the 19th century, located at the eastern end of the isolated Kumeu-Riverhead Section. The line operated from 1875 to 1881 as a link from Auckland to regions north, with Riverhead acting as the transition point from ferry to railway. When the North Auckland Line connected Kumeu with Auckland via rail in 1881, the coastal shipping became unnecessary, and with no reason to continue operating, the railway to Riverhead was closed. The region features a pine plantation forest that is popular with horse riders, mountain bikers and motorcyclists. Riverhead Forest is operated by Matariki Forests, under Crown Licence. The forest was originally planted on poor kauri gum fields.Matariki Forests  Governance  Riverhead is part of the Local Government Rodney Ward of Auckland Council and is part of the Kumeu Subdivision of the Rodney Local Board.

Lamb 1996. Pitcher-Plants of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to northwestern Borneo, Indonesia. It is a myrmecophyte noted for its mutualistic association with a species of ant, Camponotus schmitzi. As an ant-fed plant it lacks many of the features that characterise the carnivorous syndrome in Nepenthes, including viscoelastic and highly acidic pitcher fluid, the waxy zone of the pitcher interior, and possibly even functional digestive enzymes. Botanical history Nepenthes bicalcarata was formally described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in his 1873 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\", based on specimens collected by Hugh Low and Odoardo Beccari near the Lawas River in Borneo. The type specimen, Low s.n., is deposited at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.Schlauer, J. Nepenthes bicalcarata. Carnivorous Plant Database. Seven years later, Spencer Le Marchant Moore described Nepenthes dyak, based on a specimen (Teijsmann 10962) collected by Johannes Elias Teijsmann from Kapuas River near Sintang in western Borneo.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42 (1): 1‚Äì106. This specimen is also held at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and a duplicate is deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden.Specimen detail: Teijsmann 10962. Nationaal Herbarium Nederland. Nepenthes dyak was later mentioned several more times in the botanical literature,Burbidge, F.W. 1882. Notes on the new Nepenthes. The Gardeners' Chronicle, new series, 17(420): 56.Beccari, O. 1896. Malesia, III (1886‚Äì1890): Rivista delle specie del genere Nepenthes, p. 1‚Äì15. but is now considered conspecific with N. bicalcarta. Nepenthes bicalcarata was introduced to Europe in 1879 by British explorer Frederick William Burbidge, who collected plants for the famous Veitch Nursery. These were cultivated to larger size and distributed in 1881. During this time, interest in Nepenthes had reached its peak. A note in The Gardeners' Chronicle of 1881 mentions the Veitch Nursery's N. bicalcarata as follows:[Anonymous] 1881. Messr's Veitch's Nepenthes House. The Gardeners' Chronicle n. ser. 16: 598. > \\"Then there is N. bicalcarata, a most robust habited kind with sturdy > foliage and bag-like pitchers provided with a vicious-looking rat-trap-like > apparatus in its lid which renders it very distinct from its neighbours.\\" Several years after its introduction, N. bicalcarata was still very much a horticultural rarity. In Veitch's catalogue for 1889, N. bicalcarata was priced at ¬£3.3s per plant, while the famous giant-pitchered N. northiana and N. rajah were selling for ¬£2.2s. Description Nepenthes bicalcarata plants are the largest in the genus, climbing up to 20 m into the forest canopy. The cylindrical stem is thicker than that of any other Nepenthes species, measuring up to 3.5 cm in diameter. Internodes are up to 40 cm long.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.Steiner, H. 2002. Borneo: Its Mountains and Lowlands with their Pitcher Plants. Toihaan Publishing Company, Kota Kinabalu. Climbing plant with upper pitchers The leaves of N. bicalcarata are petiolate and coriaceous in texture. The lamina is obovate-lanceolate in form and also reaches huge dimensions, growing to 80 cm in length and 12 cm in width.Danser, B.H. 1928. 4. Nepenthes bicalcarata. In: The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. It is slightly decurrent on the stem, forming two narrow wings. The lamina has indistinct longitudinal veins and numerous pennate veins. Tendrils may be up to 60 cm long and 8 mm wide. They are hollow and swollen near the pitcher. Lower pitchers Although most parts of the plant are very large, the pitchers themselves do not rival those of species such as N. rajah. Nevertheless, they may have a volume of over one litre and grow up to 25 cm high and 16 cm wide. A pair of prominent fringed wings (‚â§15 mm wide) runs down the front of lower pitchers. These are usually reduced to ribs in aerial pitchers. The peristome (‚â§20 mm wide) is characteristically flattened and curved inwards. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 70% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. It bears small but distinct teeth. The two sharp spines for which the species is famous are present on the underside of the pitcher lid, and may be 3 cm long. They are derived from the uppermost 10‚Äì12 peristome ribs.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1‚Äì157. The pitcher lid or operculum is reniform to cordate and has no appendages. An unbranched spur (‚â§15 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid. Nepenthes bicalcarata has a paniculate inflorescence. The peduncle may be up to 40 cm long and the rachis can reach 100 cm in length. Female inflorescences are usually shorter.Macfarlane, J.M. 1908. Nepenthaceae. In: A. Engler Das Pflanzenreich IV, III, Heft 36: 1‚Äì91. Branches on the flower stem are up to 40 mm long and bear up to 15 flowers. Sepals are either obovate or lanceolate and up to 4 mm long. A study of 120 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (Fosberg 43860, altitude not recorded) found the mean pollen diameter to be 28.9 Œºm (SE = 0.4; CV = 7.5%).Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1999. Palynological study of Bornean Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science 22(1): 1‚Äì7. Mature plants are virtually glabrous. Caducous hairs are present on the youngest parts of the plant and on the inflorescences. Nepenthes bicalcarata varies little across its range. Consequently, no infraspecific taxa have been described. Ecology and conservation status Natural habitat of N. bicalcarata Nepenthes bicalcarata is endemic to Borneo. It is most common in the peat swamp forests of the western coast of the island, which stretch across Sarawak, Sabah, Kalimantan, and Brunei. There it often grows in the shade of the ubiquitous dipterocarp Shorea albida. Nepenthes bicalcarata also occurs in kerangas forest and has even been recorded from white sand heath forests in Sarawak and East Kalimantan. The species is often sympatric with N. ampullaria in these habitats. Specimens growing in undisturbed peat swamp forest, where sunlight is greatly diffused and high humidity prevails, reach the largest dimensions. Nepenthes bicalcarata has a shallow root system that only penetrates the top layer of peat and leaf litter, to a depth of about 25 cm. Below this, high concentrations of tannins and alkaloids render the substrate toxic. Nepenthes bicalcarata is generally found below 300 m in altitude, although Johannes Gottfried Hallier reported a single collection in 1894 from between 700 and 950 m above sea level.Hallier, H. 1895. Ein neues Cypripedium aus Borneo. Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indi√´ LIV: 450‚Äì452. The conservation status of N. bicalcarata is listed as Vulnerable on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species based on an assessment carried out in 2000. In 1997, Charles Clarke informally classified the species as Near Threatened based on the IUCN criteria. This agrees with the conservation status assigned to N. bicalcarata by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre.Simpson, R.B. 1995. Nepenthes and conservation. Curtis's Botanical Magazine 12: 111‚Äì118. Carnivory Upper pitcher with prominent thorns The two thorns that give N. bicalcarata its name are unique to this species and bear some of the largest nectaries in the plant kingdom.Merbach, M.A., G.

Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. The purpose of these structures has long been debated among botanists. Frederick William Burbidge suggested that they might serve to deter arboreal mammals such as tarsiers, lorises and monkeys from stealing the contents of the pitchers.Slack, A. 1979. Nepenthes bicalcarata. In: Carnivorous Plants. Ebury Press, London. p. 82. In an article published in 1982, Cliff Dodd speculated on the function of the thorns, but did not believe they play a role in prey capture.Dodd, C. 1982. The most dangerous (looking) Nepenthes. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 11(3): 64‚Äì65, 73, 78. Charles Clarke observed that monkeys and tarsiers rip the pitchers open at the sides in order to feed from them, rather than reaching in through the pitcher mouth.Clarke, C.[M.] 1993. The possible functions of the thorns of Nepenthes bicalcarata (Hook.f.) pitchers. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 22(1‚Äì2): 27‚Äì28. However, he found that the mammals attacked the pitchers of N. bicalcarata less frequently than those of other species, such as N. rafflesiana. Clarke's observations suggest that the spines likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the pitcher fluid, eventually drowning. A similar trapping method is employed by the Sumatran endemic N. lingulata, which has a single filiform appendage positioned over the pitcher mouth. However, in that species the appendage is a structure of the lid and not the peristome.Lee, C.C., Hernawati & P. Akhriadi 2006. Two new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from North Sumatra. Blumea 51(3): 561‚Äì568. Together with N. ampullaria and N. ventricosa, N. bicalcarata is unusual in that the glandular region of the pitcher extends almost to the peristome, such that there is little or no conductive waxy zone.Bohn, H.F. & W. Federle 2004. Insect aquaplaning: Nepenthes pitcher plants capture prey with the peristome, a fully wettable water-lubricated anisotropic surface.

Functional Surfaces in Biology: Adhesion Related Phenomena. Volume 2. Springer. pp. 183‚Äì204. The waxy zone functions by causing prey to slip and fall into the digestive fluid. A 2004 study found that the peristome of N. bicalcarata plays a very important role in prey capture. When it is dry, the peristome is highly ineffective in catching insect prey, but when wetted, the capture rate increases more than three-fold. A 1999 study of pitcher morphology and spectral reflectance characteristics showed that N. bicalcarata has no colour contrast maximum between the peristome and pitcher cup in the ultraviolet waveband, but small maxima of ‚Äì0.17 at 450 nm (violet), 0.32 at 548 nm (green), and ‚Äì0.16 at 668 nm (red).Moran, J.A., W.E. Booth & J.K. Charles 1999. Aspects of pitcher morphology and spectral characteristics of six Bornean Nepenthes pitcher plant species: implications for prey capture. Annals of Botany 83(5): 521‚Äì528. This means that the peristome is less reflective than the pitcher cup in the violet and red bands, but more reflective in the green band. The contrast maxima in the green and blue regions seem to correspond to insect visual sensitivity maxima, while the others do not. Based on their findings, the authors made the \\"tentative prediction\\" that the upper pitchers of N. bicalcarata are less successful at catching anthophilous (flower-visiting) prey than those of sympatric N. rafflesiana. Association with ants and pitcher infauna Nepenthes bicalcarata plays host to an unusual species of ant that makes its nest in the plant's hollow tendrils.Shelford, R. 1916. A Naturalist in Borneo.

The Gardens of the Sun: or, a Naturalist's Journal on the Mountains and in the Forests and Swamps of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago. John Murray, London. In 1904, Odoardo Beccari suggested that the ants feed on insects found on and around the plant, but may fall prey to it themselves.Beccari, O. 1904. Wanderings in the Great Forests of Borneo. Archibald and Constable, London. In 1990, B. H√∂lldobler and E. O. Wilson proposed that N. bicalcarata and C. schmitzi form a mutually beneficial association.H√∂lldobler, B. & E.O. Wilson 1990. The Ants. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany. At the time, however, no experimental data existed to support such a hypothesis.

Nepenthes bicalcarata is a myrmecotroph (ant-fed plant), obtaining nutrients from C. schmitzi in the form of egesta and, occasionally, ant remains. It has been estimated that this input accounts for 42% of the plant's total foliar nitrogen (76% in plants with ant occupancy rates above 75%).Bazile, V., J.A. Moran, G. Le Mogu√©dec, D.J. Marshall & L. Gaume 2012. A carnivorous plant fed by its ant symbiont: a unique multi- faceted nutritional mutualism. PLoS ONE 7(5): e36179. The ants increase nutrient retention in the pitchers by preying on infaunal flies, which would otherwise eventually leave their hosts and thereby act as kleptoparasites. This nutrients later becomes available to the plant through the ants' waste. Camponotus schmitzi has also been observed to attack newly caught insects and therefore prevent prey escape.Bonhomme, V., I. Gounand, C. Alaux, E. Jousselin, D. Barth√©l√©my & L. Gaume 2011.

At other times, the ants are very passive, remaining hidden under the inner peristome fold, presumably so as not to dissuade visitation by potential prey species. This behaviour is in stark contrast to other myrmecophytic ants, which are typically highly territorial. John Thompson has suggested that N. bicalcarata may be the only plant species that obtains nutrients through both insect capture and ant-hosting habits.Thompson, J.H. 1981. Reverse animal-plant interactions: the evolution of insectivorous and ant-fed plants. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 16: 147‚Äì155.

Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 121‚Äì141. When feeding, it appears to target large prey items only, cooperatively retrieving them from the fluid. Hauling food from the pitcher fluid to the peristome‚Äîa distance of no more than 5 cm‚Äîmay take up to 12 hours. In this way the contents of N. bicalcarata pitchers is controlled such that organic matter does not accumulate to the point of putrefaction, which could lead to the demise of pitcher infauna (which may also benefit the plant) and sometimes the pitcher itself.Hansen, E. 2001. Where rocks sing, ants swim, and plants eat animals: finding members of the Nepenthes carnivorous plant family in Borneo. Discover 22(10): 60‚Äì68. The ants have been observed to clean the peristome of fungal hyphae and other contaminants, thereby maintaining high trapping efficiency over the pitcher's lifespan.Thornham, D.G., J.M. Smith, T.U. Grafe & W. Federle 2012. Setting the trap: cleaning behaviour of Camponotus schmitzi ants increases long-term capture efficiency of their pitcher plant host, Nepenthes bicalcarata.

Research conducted by Dennis and Marlis Merbach has shown that C. schmitzi also benefits N. bicalcarata by protecting it from pitcher-destroying weevils of the genus Alcidodes.Merbach, M.A., G. Zizka, B. Fiala, D.J. Merbach, W.E. Booth & U. Maschwitz 2007. Why a carnivorous plant cooperates with an ant ‚Äì selective defense against pitcher-destroying weevils in the myrmecophytic pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata Hook.f.. Ecotropica 13: 45‚Äì56.

Forschung Frankfurt 2002(3): 74‚Äì77. In order to create a favourable environment for its pitcher inhabitants, it appears that N. bicalcarata actively maintains the pH of its pitcher fluid at a less acidic level than that found in most other Nepenthes species (this might explain the occasional presence of tree frog eggs in its pitchers). In doing so, however, the plant reduces its ability to digest and assimilate nutrients from captured prey. The pitcher fluid of N. bicalcarata is also less viscoelastic than that of most Nepenthes species, and appears to lack functional digestive enzymes. Nepenthes bicalcarata is therefore highly reliant on its ant symbiont. Indeed, plants not inhabited by C. schmitzi do not appear to benefit significantly from carnivory, with any gains from prey digestion being offset by the high costs of pitcher construction. Conversely, ant-inhabited plants have more leaves and a greater total leaf area, and ant presence is associated with lower pitcher abortion rates and more voluminous pitchers (and consequently greater prey biomass).Choi, C. 2012.

Studies have shown that plants colonised by C. schmitzi have more nitrogen available to them, and a higher proportion of it is insect- derived.Scharmann, M., D.G. Thornham, T.U. Grafe & W. Federle 2013. A novel type of nutritional ant‚Äìplant interaction: ant partners of carnivorous pitcher plants prevent nutrient export by dipteran pitcher infauna. PLoS ONE 8(5): e63556. Camponotus schmitzi nests solely in the tendrils of N. bicalcarata and rarely ventures onto other plants. The species is completely dependent on N. bicalcarata for food and domicile. Nepenthes bicalcarata, on the other hand, is able to survive and reproduce without the presence of the ants; it is a facultative mutualist. This being the case, there appear to be few mature plants over 2 metres in height not colonised by C. schmitzi. The ants seem to favour upper pitchers and rarely colonise lower pitchers.Clarke, C.M. 1997. The effects of pitcher dimorphism on the metazoan community of the carnivorous pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata Hook.f.. Malayan Nature Journal 50: 149‚Äì157. This is likely due to the fact that terrestrial traps are periodically submerged in water during heavy rains. Flooding of the ants' nest chamber could result in the demise of the ant colony, particularly the developing eggs, larvae, and pupae. A species of mite, Naiadacarus nepenthicola, appears to be restricted to the pitchers of N. bicalcarata. It is thought to feed on decomposing leaves and insects that are caught in the pitchers. Deutonymphs of this mite are dispersed through phoresy on C. schmitzi.Fashing, N.J. & T.H. Chua 2002. Systematics and ecology of Naiadacarus nepenthicola, a new species of Acaridae (Acari : Astigmata) inhabiting the pitchers of Nepenthes bicalcarata Hook. f. in Brunei Darussalam. International Journal of Acarology 28(2): 157‚Äì167. Natural hybrids The following natural hybrids involving N. bicalcarata have been recorded. *N. ampullaria √ó N. bicalcarata *(N. ampullaria √ó N. gracilis) √ó N. bicalcarata [=N. √ó trichocarpa √ó N. bicalcarata] *N. bicalcarata √ó N. gracilis [=N. √ó cantleyi] *N. bicalcarata √ó N. mirabilisMcPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. (including N. bicalcarata √ó N. mirabilis var. echinostoma) *N. bicalcarata √ó N. rafflesiana *? (N. bicalcarata √ó N. rafflesiana) √ó N. mirabilis var. echinostoma None of these hybrids are known to be colonised by C. schmitzi as is the parent species N. bicalcarata. N. ampullaria √ó N. bicalcarata Lower pitcher of N. ampullaria √ó N. bicalcarata (cultivated) Since N. ampullaria and N. bicalcarata are often sympatric in the wild, it is not surprising that they occasionally hybridise. Several examples of this natural hybrid are known from Brunei, where it grows in peat swamp forest and heath forest. It was first recorded by Mitsuru Hotta in 1966.Hotta, M. 1966. Notes on Bornean Plants. Acta Phytotaxonomica et Geobotanica 22(1‚Äì2): 7‚Äì9. Pitchers bear the characteristic thorns of N. bicalcarata, although they are greatly reduced in size. The mouth is round and the lid is ovate-cordate in form. This hybrid resembles N. √ó hookeriana to a certain extent, but differs in having spines on the underside of the lid and more globose upper pitchers with a smaller lid. Aerial pitchers of N. ampullaria √ó N. bicalcarata are usually dominated by characteristics of N. ampullaria. They are often very small and unable to function in a normal manner. (N. ampullaria √ó N. gracilis) √ó N. bicalcarata This rare complex hybrid was discovered in the lowland forests of Brunei. It produces small speckled pitchers with reduced thorns under the lid. The plant is intermediate in appearance between N. √ó trichocarpa and N. bicalcarata. N. bicalcarata √ó N. gracilis Lower pitcher of Nepenthes √ó cantleyi This hybrid has been named N. √ó cantleyi after Rob Cantley. The morphology of the pitchers closely resembles N. bicalacarata, although the peristome is more similar to that of N. gracilis. The characteristic spines of N. bicalcarata are greatly reduced and are only present as small bumps. This hybrid has the growth habit of N. gracilis, with the stem scrambling along the ground. It grows in open, sandy areas. The pitcher fluid is notably acidic like that of N. gracilis, with pH values as low as 1.82 being recorded. N. bicalcarata √ó N. mirabilis var. echinostoma This natural hybrid is rare and is only known from Brunei, where it involves N. mirabilis var. echinostoma. It closely resembles N. bicalcarata, although it differs from that species in having reduced thorns and a wider peristome. Unlike N. bicalcarata, this hybrid inhabits open areas with sandy substrates. N. bicalcarata √ó N. rafflesiana This relatively rare natural hybrid is sometimes found growing among populations of N. bicalcarata and N. rafflesiana. It is intermediate in form between its parent species. (N. bicalcarata √ó N. rafflesiana) √ó N. mirabilis var. echinostoma Charles Clarke reported a single plant displaying characters intermediate between those of N. bicalcarata, N. rafflesiana and N. mirabilis var. echinostoma, and growing among populations of these species. It is likely a complex hybrid, although this cannot be proven without the use of molecular techniques. Cultivation and cultivars Lower pitcher of a plant cultivated in Kuching, Sarawak. Nepenthes bicalcarata may be cultivated in a similar manner to other members of the genus, though it requires relatively hot and humid conditions.D'Amato, P. 1998. The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley. It needs large pots to do well, and temporary halts in growth are often due to becoming root-bound. Re-potting to a larger pot will often result in a rapid size increase. Under satisfactory conditions, this plant will grow quite fast for a Nepenthes, reaching a large size relatively rapidly. Despite naturally occurring in peat swamp forests, N. bicalcarata has been successfully grown in a completely inorganic substrate consisting of one part each of Seramis clay perls, lava gravel, and Lecaton expanded clay perls.Rischer, H. 2000. Growing Nepenthes in a Completely Inorganic Substrate. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 29(2): 50‚Äì53. Nepenthes bicalcarata has been artificially crossed with N. hirsuta. A particularly robust-pitchered cultivar of this hybrid was named Nepenthes 'Hortulanus Otten', in honour of Karel Otten, former curator of the Botanic Garden in Ghent, Belgium.Cook, D., J.H. Hummer, A. Vogel, O. Gluch & C. Clayton 2004. New Cultivars. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 33(1): 19‚Äì22. A cultivar of the artificial cross N. bicalcarata √ó N. √ó dyeriana was registered in 1988 under the name Nepenthes 'Nina Dodd'. It is named after a relative of Cliff Dodd, who created the hybrid.Robinson, J.T. 1988. New Cultivars. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 17(1): 20. Two further cultivars of manmade hybrids involving N. bicalcarata have been named. These are Nepenthes 'Bella' ((N. ampullaria √ó N. bicalcarata) √ó N. truncata) and Nepenthes 'Rapa' (N. ampullaria √ó N. bicalcarata).Fukatsu, Y. 1999. List of Nepenthes Hybrids.

Romana Cruz, Philippine Daily Inquirer (22 July 1996)\\"Larry Alcala, 1926-2002\\", UPdate Diliman (May‚ÄìJune 2002) In 2018, he was posthumously conferred the National Artist for Visual Arts title and the Grand Collar of the Order of National Artists (Order ng Pambansang Alagad ng Sining). Biography He was born on August 18, 1926 to Ernesto Alcala and Elpidia Zarate in Daraga, Albay. Through a scholarship from Manila Times granted by the publisher Ram√≥n Roces, he obtained a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1950. He became a professor at the same university from 1951 to 1981. He also received the Australian Cultural Award accompanied by a travel study grant in 1975. He started his cartooning career in 1946 while still attending school. After World War II, he created his very first comic strip, Islaw Palitaw, which was printed on the pages of the Filipino weekly magazine Liwayway. In 1947, he created the comic strip Kalabog en Bosyo, using Taglish as the medium of communication of his characters. He pioneered animated cartoons for television commercials of products such as Darigold Milk in 1957 and Caltex in 1965. His campaign for the advancement of illustration and commercial art in the Philippines resulted to the establishment of the Visual Communication Department at the UP College of Fine Arts. In 1997, the Philippine Board on Books for Young People (PBBY) granted him the title Dean of Filipino Cartoonists, an achievement award for his lifetime dedication to the art of capturing humor in the character and everyday life in the Philippines. In 1991, he promoted the formation of a group of young children's book illustrators called Ang Ilustrador ng Kabataan (Ang INK). All in all, he made over 500 cartoon characters, twenty comic strips, six movies, two murals, and 15,000 published pages in his 56 years of professional cartooning career. He believed in the far-reaching role of cartoons in education and value formation. He died on June 24, 2002 when he was 75. His cartoons His most popular cartoon series was Slice of Life, which is a reflection of the many unique aspects of everyday life in the Philippines. He captured the interest of his weekend patrons by giving them the task of looking for his image cleverly concealed within the weekend cartoon. He did the same with his other comic strip Kalabog and Bosyo. His cartoons had been tapped in advertising campaigns, such as corporate calendars, print ads, promotional T-shirts and in San Miguel Beer cans. In 1988, his Slice of Life received the Best in Humor award and was also cited for helping to keep alive the Filipino's ability to laugh at himself, through the lively marriage of art and humor, and through commentaries that are at once critical and compassionate, evoking laughter and reflection. Slice of Life appeared on the pages of the Weekend Magazine. Mang Ambo Mang Ambo is the personification of the Filipino according to Larry Alcala. Mang Ambo, the character, is an incorrigible cock-eyed innocent, possessing a small town charm amidst urban sophistication. Through Mang Ambo and the other characters of a fictional place called, Barrio Bulabog, Alcala exposed the follies and foibles of Philippine society in general and of cosmopolitan life in particular. In this cartoon strip‚Äôs characters, he also affirmed the Filipino's peculiar coping mechanism of laughing at himself in the face of adversity but still absorbing life's vicissitudes with resilience. Mang Ambo made its debut in 1960 as a full-page feature in the Weekly Graphic. The cartoon series later became the first Alcala comic strip to be compiled in book form. Kalabog en Bosyo Alcala's most enduring comic strip was Kalabog en Bosyo that first appeared on the pages of Pilipino Komiks in 1947. It eventually became the longest running cartoon series created by a Filipino. Decades before Slice of Life, Alcala was already doing cameo roles in his Kalabog en Bosyo comic strips, but instead of portraying himself with a moustach, spectacles and side burns, he rendered himself in a crew-cut, younger and about 100-pounds thinner profile. An onomatopoeic Tagalog word, the name of the character, Kalabog, refers to the thud sound produced after the impact of a falling object finally reaching solid ground. In Kalabog en Bosyo, Alcala pioneered in the blending of Tagalog and English or Taglish as the medium of communication among his characters. The comic misadventures of the two bungling detectives namely Kalabog and Bosyo had been transposed into films by Sampaguita Pictures in 1957, starring the Filipino actors-comedians, Dolphy and Panchito Alba.

It stars Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. The film consists of three short stories about couples in different parts of Italy. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 37th Academy Awards. Plot=Adelina of Naples Set in the poorer Naples in 1954, Adelina (Sophia Loren) supports her unemployed husband Carmine (Marcello Mastroianni) and child by selling black market cigarettes. When she doesn't pay a fine, her furniture is to be repossessed. However her neighbors assist her by hiding the furniture. A lawyer who lives in the neighborhood advises Carmine that, as the fine and furniture are in Adelina's name, she will be imprisoned. However, Italian law stipulates that women cannot be imprisoned when pregnant or within six months after a pregnancy. As a result, Adelina schemes to stay pregnant continuously. After seven children in eight years, Carmine is seriously exhausted and Adelina must make the choice of being impregnated by their mutual friend Pasquale (Aldo Giuffr√®) or be incarcerated. She finally chooses to be incarcerated, and the whole neighborhood gathers money to free her and petition for her pardon, which finally comes and she is reunited with her husband Carmine and their children. Anna of Milan Anna (Sophia Loren dressed by Christian Dior), the wife of a mega-rich industrialist, has a lover named Renzo (Marcello Mastroianni). Whilst driving together in her husband's Rolls-Royce, Anna must determine which is the most important to her happiness ‚Äì Renzo or the Rolls. Renzo rethinks his infatuation with Anna when she expresses no concern when they nearly run over a child, and end up crashing the Rolls-Royce. She is infuriated by the damage to her Rolls-Royce, and ends up getting another passing driver to take her home, leaving Renzo on the road. Mara of Rome Mara (Sophia Loren) works as a prostitute from her apartment, servicing a variety of high class clients including Augusto (Marcello Mastroianni), the wealthy, powerful and neurotic son of a Bologna industrialist. Mara's elderly neighbor's grandson Umberto (Gianni Ridolfi) is a handsome and callow young man studying for the priesthood but not yet ordained. Umberto and Mara talk one night asking each other about their occupations. Embarrassed, Mara tells him she does manicures. Umberto's grandmother (Tina Pica) sees them talking and, knowing that Mara is a prostitute, interrupts their conversation telling Mara that she'll go to hell. Umberto protests, but Mara defends herself. Umberto falls in love with her. To the shrieking dismay of his grandmother, the young man wishes to leave his vocation to be with Mara, or to join the French Foreign Legion, if Mara rejects him.

It is likely that the Chronicle was published for the sole purpose of including The Idler, since it had produced only one issue before the series began, and ceased publication when it finished. The authors besides Johnson were Thomas Warton, Bennet Langton, and Joshua Reynolds. Johnson's biographer, James Boswell, recalled that Johnson wrote some of the essays in The Idler \\"as hastily as an ordinary letter\\". He said that once while visiting Oxford, Johnson composed an essay due for publication the next day in the half-hour before the last post was collected. The essays were so popular that other publications began reprinting them without permission, prompting Johnson to insert a notice in the Chronicle threatening to do the same to his competitors' material and give the profits to London's prostitutes. When The Idler appeared in book form, one of Johnson's essays, The Vulture, was omitted, apparently because its anti-war satire was felt to be seditious. Johnson replaced it with an essay on the imprisonment of debtors.; The essays All the essays were published under the byline \\"Idler\\". They were not given titles until they were published in book form. In the book's introduction, Johnson specified that twelve of the essays were not his. The authors of seven of the essays were named in Boswell's biography; the authorship of the other five remains unclear. No 1. The Idler's character (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 15 April 1758 Johnson explains how he chose his pen name. \\"Every man is\\", he says, \\"or hopes to be, an Idler.\\" He promises his readers \\"obloquy and satire\\": \\"The Idler is naturally censorious; those who attempt nothing themselves, think every thing easily performed, and consider the unsuccessful always as criminal.\\" However, he says that this incurs no obligation and that disappointed readers will have only themselves to blame. :\\"Every mode of life has its conveniencies. The Idler, who habituates himself to be satisfied with what he can most easily obtain, not only escapes labours which are often fruitless, but sometimes succeeds better than those who despise all that is within their reach, and think every thing more valuable as it is harder to be acquired.\\" No 2. Invitation to correspondents (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 22 April 1758 Johnson complains that, although he has \\"now been a writer almost a week\\", he has not received a single letter of praise, nor has he had any contributions to the series. He asks for \\"those who have already devoted themselves to literature, or, without any determinate intention, wander at large through the expanse of life\\" to submit essays for publication under the Idler byline. :\\"He that is known to contribute to a periodical work, needs no other caution than not to tell what particular pieces are his own; such secrecy is indeed very difficult; but if it can be maintained, it is scarcely to be imagined at how small an expense he may grow considerable.\\" No 3. Idler's reason for writing (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 29 April 1758 Johnson considers the possibility that essayists may someday run out of amusing topics. He explains that he writes to bring relief to his fellow idlers and others \\"who awake in the morning, vacant of thought, with minds gaping for the intellectual food, which some kind essayist has been accustomed to supply.\\" :\\"Much mischief is done in the world with very little interest or design. He that assumes the character of a critick, and justifies his claim by perpetual censure, imagines that he is hurting none but the author, and him he considers as a pestilent animal, whom every other being has a right to persecute; little does he think how many harmless men he involves in his own guilt, by teaching them to be noxious without malignity, and to repeat objections which they do not understand; or how many honest minds he debars from pleasure, by exciting an artificial fastidiousness, and making them too wise to concur with their own sensations. He who is taught by a critick to dislike that which pleased him in his natural state, has the same reason to complain of his instructor, as the madman to rail at his doctor, who, when he thought himself master of Peru, physicked him to poverty.\\" No 4. Charities and hospitals (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 6 May 1758 Johnson says that charity is \\"known only to those who enjoy, either immediately or by transmission, the light of revelation.\\" He claims that it was unheard of in ancient Rome, and that Islam and Zoroastrianism imported the idea from Judaism or Christianity. He notes that hospitals in Britain are sustained solely by charitable donations, and calls upon them to stop feuding with one another lest such donations be discouraged. :\\"Compassion is by some reasoners, on whom the name of philosophers has been too easily conferred, resolved into an affection merely selfish, an involuntary perception of pain at the involuntary sight of a being like ourselves languishing in misery. But this sensation, if ever it be felt at all from the brute instinct of uninstructed nature, will only produce effects desultory and transient; it will never settle into a principle of action, or extend relief to calamities unseen, in generations not yet in being.\\" No 5. Proposal for a female army (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 13 May 1758 As more soldiers are deployed in the Seven Years' War, Johnson affects pity for the wives and sweethearts left behind in England, and suggests that an army of women be formed so they can follow their loved ones. He says that since the invention of modern weapons, he \\"cannot find that a modern soldier has any duties, except that of obedience, which a lady cannot perform. If the hair has lost its powder, a lady has a puff; if a coat be spotted, a lady has a brush.\\" :\\"Of these ladies, some, I hope, have lap-dogs, and some monkeys; but they are unsatisfactory companions. Many useful offices are performed by men of scarlet, to which neither dog nor monkey has adequate abilities. A parrot, indeed, is as fine as a colonel, and, if he has been much used to good company, is not wholly without conversation; but a parrot, after all, is a poor little creature, and has neither sword nor shoulder-knot, can neither dance nor play at cards.\\" No 6. Lady's performance on horseback (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 20 May 1758 Johnson comments on the public adulation given a woman who rode a horse a thousand miles in less than a thousand hours. With tongue in cheek, he suggests that a statue be erected to her for posterity, and speculates on the wording of the inscription. :\\"Let it therefore be carefully mentioned, that by this performance she won her wager; and, lest this should, by any change of manners, seem an inadequate or incredible incitement, let it be added, that at this time the original motives of human actions had lost their influence; that the love of praise was extinct; the fear of infamy was become ridiculous; and the only wish of an Englishman was\\" to win his wager. No 7. Scheme for news-writers (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 27 May 1758 Johnson bemoans the repetitiveness of news coverage. He suggests that, instead of announcing an event all at once and then rehashing it endlessly, newspaper writers should reveal the story gradually to keep readers entertained. :\\"Thus journals are daily multiplied without increase of knowledge. The tale of the morning paper is told again in the evening, and the narratives of the evening are bought again in the morning. These repetitions, indeed, waste time, but they do not shorten it. The most eager peruser of news is tired before he has completed his labour; and many a man, who enters the coffee-house in his nightgown and slippers, is called away to his shop, or his dinner, before he has well considered the state of Europe.\\" No 8. Plan of military discipline (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 3 June 1758 This instalment takes the form of a letter to the Idler, but it is not among the essays that Johnson attributed to others. The writer proposes a method of developing courage in British soldiers. He suggests that they be lured to a mock fortress with roast beef and ale and made to march upon it before they can eat. This should be done day after day, with a few more frightening sights and sounds being added to the scene each time. The soldiers will eventually be accustomed enough to violence to brave enemy fire. :\\"I cannot pretend to inform our generals through what gradations of danger they should train their men to fortitude. They best know what the soldiers and what themselves can bear. It will be proper that the war should every day vary its appearance. Sometimes, as they mount the rampart, a cook may throw fat upon the fire, to accustom them to a sudden blaze; and sometimes, by the clatter of empty pots, they may be inured to formidable noises. But let it never be forgotten, that victory must repose with a full belly.\\" No 9. Progress of idleness (authorship uncertain) Published: Saturday, 10 June 1758 A correspondent complains that the Idler does not give tips on how to be idle. The Idler says this request shows that the writer \\"is yet but in the rudiments of idleness, and has attained neither the practice nor theory of wasting life.\\" True idleness comes only with practice. :\\"So wide is the region of Idleness, and so powerful her influence. But she does not immediately confer all her gifts. My correspondent, who seems, with all his errours, worthy of advice, must be told, that he is calling too hastily for the last effusion of total insensibility. Whatever he may have been taught by unskilful Idlers to believe, labour is necessary in his initiation to idleness. He that never labours may know the pains of idleness, but not the pleasure. The comfort is, that if he devotes himself to insensibility, he will daily lengthen the intervals of idleness, and shorten those of labour, till at last he will lie down to rest, and no longer disturb the world or himself by bustle or competition.\\" No 10. Political credulity (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 17 June 1758 Johnson discusses political zealots, who \\"resign the use of their own eyes and ears, and resolve to believe nothing that does not favour those whom they profess to follow.\\" He describes the two basic types of his time, personified as Tom Tempest (a supporter of the House of Stuart) and Jack Sneaker (a supporter of the House of Hanover). :\\"The bigot of philosophy is seduced by authorities which he has not always opportunities to examine, is entangled in systems by which truth and falsehood are inextricably complicated, or undertakes to talk on subjects which nature did not form him able to comprehend.\\" No 11. Discourses on the weather (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 24 June 1758 Johnson says the English are obsessed with their weather because it is so changeable. He lampoons the fashionable theory that a country's political climate is determined by its weather, and criticises those who let the weather affect their mood. :\\"Such is the reason of our practice; and who shall treat it with contempt? Surely not the attendant on a court, whose business is to watch the looks of a being weak and foolish as himself, and whose vanity is to recount the names of men, who might drop into nothing, and leave no vacuity; nor the proprietor of funds, who stops his acquaintance in the street to tell him of the loss of half-a-crown; nor the inquirer after news, who fills his head with foreign events, and talks of skirmishes and sieges, of which no consequence will ever reach his hearers or himself. The weather is a nobler and more interesting subject; it is the present state of the skies, and of the earth, on which plenty and famine are suspended, on which millions depend for the necessaries of life.\\" No 12. Marriages, why advertised (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 1 July 1758 Johnson mocks marriage announcements in newspapers, which he says are published out of the couples' desire for fame. He tells of a friend's plan to set up a business selling \\"matrimonial panegyricks\\". :\\"To get a name, can happen but to few. A name, even in the most commercial nation, is one of the few things which cannot be bought. It is the free gift of mankind, which must be deserved before it will be granted, and is at last unwillingly bestowed. But this unwillingness only increases desire in him who believes his merit sufficient to overcome it.\\" No 13. The imaginary housewife (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 8 July 1758 A fictional correspondent complains that his wife, in her fear of idleness, makes their daughters work constantly at sewing. As a result, the house is filled with unneeded embroidery and the girls are ignorant of every other subject. :\\"Molly asked me the other day, whether Ireland was in France, and was ordered by her mother to mend her hem. Kitty knows not, at sixteen, the difference between a Protestant and a Papist, because she has been employed three years in filling the side of a closet with a hanging that is to represent Cranmer in the flames. And Dolly, my eldest girl, is now unable to read a chapter in the Bible, having spent all the time, which other children pass at school, in working the interview between Solomon and the queen of Sheba.\\" No 14. Robbery of time (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 15 July 1758 Johnson discusses those who waste time by waiting upon great men. \\"The truth is\\", he comments, \\"that the inconveniencies of attendance are more lamented than felt.\\" More troubling are everyday nuisances like chatterboxes and the habitually late. :\\"If we will have the kindness of others, we must endure their follies. He who cannot persuade himself to withdraw from society, must be content to pay a tribute of his time to a multitude of tyrants; to the loiterer, who makes appointments which he never keeps; to the consulter, who asks advice which he never takes; to the boaster, who blusters only to be praised; to the complainer, who whines only to be pitied; to the projector, whose happiness is to entertain his friends with expectations which all but himself know to be vain; to the economist, who tells of bargains and settlements; to the politician, who predicts the fate of battles and breach of alliances; to the usurer, who compares the different funds; and to the talker, who talks only because he loves to be talking.\\" No 15. Treacle's complaint of his wife (authorship uncertain) Published: Saturday, 22 July 1758 A correspondent calling himself Zachary Treacle complains about his domestic life. His wife hangs around his grocery shop all day getting in the way, while his young son climbs on the shelves and knocks things over. Both force him to spend his Sundays in idleness, much to his annoyance. :\\"Thus, Sir, does she constantly drawl out her time, without either profit or satisfaction; and, while I see my neighbours' wives helping in the shop, and almost earning as much as their husbands, I have the mortification to find that mine is nothing but a dead weight upon me. In short, I do not know any greater misfortune can happen to a plain hard-working tradesman, as I am, than to be joined to such a woman, who is rather a clog than a helpmate to him.\\" No 16. Drugget's retirement (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 29 July 1758 Johnson describes a visit to his friend Ned Drugget, a dealer in cloth remnants. Although Drugget has become rich through hard work, he longed for fresh air and relaxation, and has therefore rented a 'country lodging' ‚Äî a room in Islington. He spends his days counting passing carriages through the window, which he cannot open because of the dust. :\\"Every maid, whose misfortune it was to be taller than her lady, matched her gown at Mr. Drugget's; and many a maiden, who had passed a winter with her aunt in London, dazzled the rusticks, at her return, with cheap finery which Drugget had supplied. His shop was often visited in a morning by ladies who left their coaches in the next street, and crept through the alley in linen gowns. Drugget knows the rank of his customers by their bashfulness; and, when he finds them unwilling to be seen, invites them up stairs, or retires with them to the back window.\\" No 17. Expedients of idlers (Johnson) Published: 5 August 1758 Recent weather forecasts for London have been wildly inaccurate. Johnson says this is but one example of the follies of speculating. He says scientists are really idlers who don't want to admit they are idlers. Those who \\"sport only with inanimate nature\\" are useless but innocent, but those who perform cruel experiments on animals are \\"a race of wretches\\". The rest of the essay is a fierce denunciation of vivisection. :\\"Among those whom I never could persuade to rank themselves with Idlers, and who speak with indignation of my morning sleeps and nocturnal rambles; one passes the day in catching spiders, that he may count their eyes with a microscope; another erects his head, and exhibits the dust of a marigold separated from the flower with a dexterity worthy of Leuwenhoeck himself. Some turn the wheel of electricity; some suspend rings to a load- stone, and find that what they did yesterday they can do again to-day. Some register the changes of the wind, and die fully convinced that the wind is changeable.\\" No 18. Drugget vindicated (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 12 August 1758 A correspondent writes to defend Ned Drugget, whose \\"country home\\" was mocked in No 16. All pleasures and diversions are the result of self- deception. :\\"The theatre is not filled with those that know or regard the skill of the actor, nor the ball-room by those who dance, or attend to the dancers. To all places of general resort, where the standard of pleasure is erected, we run with equal eagerness, or appearance of eagerness, for very different reasons. One goes that he may say he has been there, another because he never misses. This man goes to try what he can find, and that to discover what others find. Whatever diversion is costly will be frequented by those who desire to be thought rich; and whatever has, by any accident, become fashionable, easily continues its reputation, because every one is ashamed of not partaking it.\\" No 19. Whirler's character (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 19 August 1758 One school of philosophy states that happiness is to be found in complete relaxation, while another says it is irresponsible not to contribute to the work of humanity. Johnson introduces a great philosopher of the middle ground, Jack Whirler, \\"whose business keeps him in perpetual motion, and whose motion always eludes his business; who is always to do what he never does, who cannot stand still because he is wanted in another place, and who is wanted in many places because he stays in none.\\" :\\"Thus Jack Whirler lives in perpetual fatigue without proportionate advantage, because he does not consider that no man can see all with his own eyes, or do all with his own hands; that whoever is engaged in multiplicity of business, must transact much by substitution, and leave something to hazard; and that he who attempts to do all, will waste his life in doing little.\\" No 20. Capture of Louisbourg (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 29 August 1758 Following the British victory at Fort Louisbourg, Johnson imagines how both British and French historians will describe the event in a hundred years. :\\"For this reason every historian discovers his country; and it is impossible to read the different accounts of any great event, without a wish that truth had more power over partiality.\\" No 21. Linger's history of listlessness (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 2 September 1758 A correspondent called Dick Linger describes his futile lifelong struggle against listlessness. He was in the army, but quit because of boredom; married, but found ennui soon set in; and now spends his days making a nuisance of himself at the houses of friends. He has a plan for a \\"complete amendment\\" of his life, but has been putting off implementing it for more than twenty years. :\\"I suppose every man is shocked when he hears how frequently soldiers are wishing for war. The wish is not always sincere; the greater part are content with sleep and lace, and counterfeit an ardour which they do not feel; but those who desire it most are neither prompted by malevolence nor patriotism; they neither pant for laurels, nor delight in blood; but long to be delivered from the tyranny of idleness, and restored to the dignity of active beings.\\" No 22. The vulture (Johnson) (This essay was omitted when The Idler was published in book form. The essay that follows, 22a, took its place.) Published: 16 September 1758 A mother vulture is instructing her children before they leave the nest. She tells them that of all of deep nuts are the titbits of flesh she has brought them, the tastiest come from man. The children ask how she can kill a man, who is so much bigger than her. The mother says she doesn't have to; men regularly meet in fields where they kill one another in large numbers and leave the corpses as a feast for the vultures. The children are astonished that any animal would kill something it did not intend to eat. The mother repeats a theory that men are not animals at all, but \\"vegetables with a power of motion; and that as the boughs of an oak are dashed together by the storm, that swine may fatten upon the falling acorns, so men are, by some unaccountable power, driven one against another, till they lose their motion, that vultures may be fed.\\" :\\"The old vultures will tell you when you are to watch his motions. When you see men in great numbers moving close together, like a flock of storks, you may conclude that they are hunting, and that you will soon revel in human blood.\\" =No 22a. Imprisonment of debtors (Johnson)= (This essay was printed in place of The vulture when the series was collected in book form.) A correspondent condemns the practice of sending debtors to prison, saying that many end up there because of jealousy and spite, rather than because they have done any real harm. Creditors should be given a fixed amount of time to prove that a debtor has hidden assets. If no proof can be found, the debtor should be released. :\\"Those who made the laws have apparently supposed, that every deficiency of payment is the crime of the debtor. But the truth is, that the creditor always shares the act, and often more than shares the guilt, of improper trust. It seldom happens that any man imprisons another but for debts which he suffered to be contracted in hope of advantage to himself, and for bargains in which he proportioned his profit to his own opinion of the hazard; and there is no reason why one should punish the other for a contract in which both concurred.\\" No 23. Uncertainty of friendship (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 23 September 1758 Johnson considers the many ways in which a friendship can end, such as envy, suspicion, sudden disagreements or casual decay. Meeting an old friend after a long separation is usually disappointing: \\"no man considers how much alteration time has made in himself, and very few inquire what effect it has had upon others.\\" :\\"Friendship is often destroyed by opposition of interest, not only by the ponderous and visible interest which the desire of wealth and greatness forms and maintains, but by a thousand secret and slight competitions, scarcely known to the mind upon which they operate. There is scarcely any man without some favourite trifle which he values above greater attainments, some desire of petty praise which he cannot patiently suffer to be frustrated. This minute ambition is sometimes crossed before it is known, and sometimes defeated by wanton petulance; but such attacks are seldom made without the loss of friendship; for whoever has once found the vulnerable part will always be feared, and the resentment will burn on in secret, of which shame hinders the discovery.\\" No 24. Man does not always think (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 30 September 1758 Johnson is not very interested in whether animals think, because he is too busy wondering whether his fellow humans think. A great portion of humanity spend their lives in a state of \\"careless stupidity\\". Johnson concludes that a lack of thought comes from a lack of material to think about. :\\"It is reasonable to believe, that thought, like every thing else, has its causes and effects; that it must proceed from something known, done, or suffered; and must produce some action or event. Yet how great is the number of those in whose minds no source of thought has ever been opened, in whose life no consequence of thought is ever discovered; who have learned nothing upon which they can reflect; who have neither seen nor felt any thing which could leave its traces on the memory; who neither foresee nor desire any change in their condition, and have therefore neither fear, hope, nor design, and yet are supposed to be thinking beings.\\" No 25. New actors on the stage (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 7 October 1758 A correspondent pleads on behalf of young actors, suggesting urging theatre critics to make allowances for nervousness and inexperience. Johnson extends the appeal to young poets, then to young people in general. :\\"There is nothing for which such numbers think themselves qualified as for theatrical exhibition. Every human being has an action graceful to his own eye, a voice musical to his own ear, and a sensibility which nature forbids him to know that any other bosom can excel. An art in which such numbers fancy themselves excellent, and which the publick liberally rewards, will excite many competitors, and in many attempts there must be many miscarriages.\\" No 26. Betty Broom's history (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 14 October 1758 Betty Broom, a kitchen maid, tells her sad history. She was educated for a few years at a charity school, where she excelled. However, the school's chief donor stopped giving money, saying the poor were becoming so well educated that it was difficult for the rich to find servants. The school closed down, and Betty was sent to find a position. She originally worked for the family of a rich watchmaker, but they squandered their money on entertainment and could not pay the servants. She was then hired to wait on a hatter and his wife, who kept such different hours that she had no chance to sleep. Her next employers had six children and ordered her to indulge them in everything, but since she couldn't keep all the children happy at once, she was dismissed. Finally she worked in a linen shop. The owner's wife stole money and blamed her when the loss was discovered. Betty promises to complete her story another time, and asks the Idler to tell her \\"for which of my places, except perhaps the last, I was disqualified by my skill in reading and writing.\\" :\\"At last the chief of our subscribers, having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends, that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a wench was to be got for all work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies; that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls; those, who were to live by their hands, should neither read nor write out of her pocket; the world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\\" No 27. Power of habits (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 21 October 1758 Most people who resolve to change their habits fail, although that does not dissuade them from trying again and again. When someone does manage to change, the change has usually been forced upon them. Johnson counsels his readers to avoid taking up bad habits in the first place, since this is far easier than getting rid of them later. :\\"This counsel has been often given with serious dignity, and often received with appearance of conviction; but, as very few can search deep into their own minds without meeting what they wish to hide from themselves, scarcely any man persists in cultivating such disagreeable acquaintance, but draws the veil again between his eyes and his heart, leaves his passions and appetites as he found them, and advises others to look into themselves.\\" No 28. Wedding-day. Grocer's wife. Chairman (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 28 October 1758 This entry begins with responses to two earlier instalments. Timothy Mushroom tells how he was determined to avoid announcing his marriage in the papers (see No 12), but was pressured into it by his bride's family. Next, Mrs Treacle, the wife of the shopkeeper in No 14, writes to tell her side of the story. Her husband bought his shop with her dowry, goes to the alehouse at every opportunity and squanders his money playing ninepins. She has to hang around the shop to make sure he works, and she takes him out on Sundays so that he will not spend the day in dissipation. Finally, a chairman (that is, one who carries passengers on a chair) complains that he should be paid according to the weight of his passengers. :\\"It is very easy for a man who sits idle at home, and has nobody to please but himself, to ridicule or to censure the common practices of mankind; and those who have no present temptation to break the rules of propriety, may applaud his judgment, and join in his merriment; but let the author or his readers mingle with common life, they will find themselves irresistibly borne away by the stream of custom, and must submit, after they have laughed at others, to give others the same opportunity of laughing at them.\\" No 29. Betty Broom's history continued (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 4 November 1758 Betty Broom, whom we first met in No 26, continues her story. After leaving the linen shop, she took lodging in a garret, where a neighbour stole many of her clothes. She eventually found work as an under-maid in a mercer's household. The mercer's son stayed out drinking till late at night, and Betty was told to wait up for him and see he got to bed safely. She passed the time by reading books from her master's library. When the mercer's wife found out about this, she sacked Betty, declaring that \\"she never knew any of the readers that had good designs in their heads.\\" Betty then worked for a gentlewoman who loved books and was pleased to have a maid who loved them too. However, this happiness lasted for just fifteen months before the gentlewoman suddenly died. At her next position, Betty was fired after just three weeks because the family thought her manners were too refined for a servant, and concluded she must be a gentlewoman in disguise. At the next, she is sacked when the mistress discovers she can write; at the next, she is at first encouraged by the housekeeper and steward, but then forced out when the housekeeper becomes jealous. Her final situation was with a consumptive woman, who had a foul temper but left Betty five hundred pounds in her will. Betty decides to retire on this fortune to her native parish, and to spend her time teaching poor girls to read and write. :\\"At last, the upper-maid found my book, and showed it to my mistress, who told me, that wenches like me might spend their time better; that she never knew any of the readers that had good designs in their heads; that she could always find something else to do with her time, than to puzzle over books; and did not like that such a fine lady should sit up for her young master.\\" No 30. Corruption of news-writers (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 11 November 1758 Stating that \\"money and time are the heaviest burdens of life, and that the unhappiest of all mortals are those who have more of either than they know how to use\\", Johnson praises those who spend their lives inventing new amusement for the rich and idle. Chief among these are the newswriters, who have multiplied greatly in recent years. Johnson identifies the necessary qualities of a journalist as \\"contempt of shame and indifference to truth\\", and says that wartime offers the perfect opportunity to exercise these. :\\"Among the calamities of war may be justly numbered the diminution of the love of truth, by the falsehoods which interest dictates, and credulity encourages. A peace will equally leave the warriour and relater of wars destitute of employment; and I know not whether more is to be dreaded from streets filled with soldiers accustomed to plunder, or from garrets filled with scribblers accustomed to lie.\\" No 31. Disguises of idleness. Sober's character (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 18 November 1758 Johnson talks about the many forms idleness can take. There are idlers who are proud to call themselves idle, and there are idlers who disguise their idleness with pointless bustling. There are those who occupy themselves by making plans that will never come about. Then there are those who prefer \\"to fill the day with petty business, to have always something in hand which may raise curiosity, but not solicitude, and keep the mind in a state of action, but not of labour.\\" The exemplar of this type is Mr Sober. Full of ideas but too lazy to carry them out, he distracts himself with conversation and hobbies. Hester Thrale wrote in her Miscellanies that this essay was \\"intended as his own portrait\\".Idler and Adventurer. The Yale Edition of the Works of Samuel Johnson. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1963. Page 97, note 5. :\\"Sober is a man of strong desires and quick imagination, so exactly balanced by the love of ease, that they can seldom stimulate him to any difficult undertaking; they have, however, so much power, that they will not suffer him to lie quite at rest; and though they do not make him sufficiently useful to others, they make him at least weary of himself.\\" No 32. On Sleep (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 25 November 1758 Johnson contemplates the power of sleep, which comes from an unknown source, overpowers all people equally, and provides an escape from the struggles of life. Many people, not content with the forgetfulness provided by sleep, supplement it with \\"semi- slumbers\\" like drunkenness, daydreaming and company. :\\"All envy would be extinguished, if it were universally known that there are none to be envied, and surely none can be much envied who are not pleased with themselves. There is reason to suspect, that the distinctions of mankind have more show than value, when it is found that all agree to be weary alike of pleasures and of cares; that the powerful and the weak, the celebrated and obscure, join in one common wish, and implore from nature's hand the nectar of oblivion.\\" No 33. Journal of a fellow of a college (Warton) Published: Saturday, 2 December 1758 A correspondent submits the diary of a senior fellow at Cambridge University, a chronicle of idleness, gluttony and petty complaints. Walton follows this with a defence of Oxford and Cambridge. The \\"genius of the place\\" inspires students to high achievement, and the universities keep students virtuous by \\"excluding all opportunities of vice\\". :\\"Twelve. Drest. Sauntered up to the Fish-monger's hill. Met Mr. H. and went with him to Peterhouse. Cook made us wait thirty-six minutes beyond the time. The company, some of my Emmanuel friends. For dinner, a pair of soles, a leg of pork and pease, among other things. Mem. Pease-pudding not boiled enough. Cook reprimanded and sconced in my presence.\\" No 34. Punch and conversation compared (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 9 December 1758 After a discussion of analogies and metaphors, Johnson compares the components of good punch to those of good conversation. He equates spirits with wit, lemon juice with raillery, sugar with adulation and water with \\"easy prattle\\". The ingredients must be blended in the right proportions to create a pleasing final product. :\\"He only will please long, who, by tempering the acidity of satire with the sugar of civility, and allaying the heat of wit with the frigidity of humble chat, can make the true punch of conversation; and, as that punch can be drunk in the greatest quantity which has the largest proportion of water, so that companion will be oftenest welcome, whose talk flows out with inoffensive copiousness, and unenvied insipidity.\\" No 35. Auction-hunter described and ridiculed (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 16 December 1758 A husband complains that his wife is always hunting for bargains at auctions, even though the house is crammed with her purchases. She also buys meat in bulk and preserves it in salt, rather than pay a higher price for fresh meat. At his wits' end, he resolves to hold his own auction and clear out his house. :\\"I am the unfortunate husband of a buyer of bargains. My wife has somewhere heard, that a good housewife never has any thing to purchase when it is wanted. This maxim is often in her mouth, and always in her head. She is not one of those philosophical talkers that speculate without practice; and learn sentences of wisdom only to repeat them: she is always making additions to her stores; she never looks into a broker's shop, but she spies something that may be wanted some time; and it is impossible to make her pass the door of a house where she hears goods selling by auction.\\" No 36. The terrific diction ridiculed (Johnson) Published: 23 December 1758 Johnson identifies a new kind of pompous language: the \\"terrific\\" style, also known as \\"repulsive\\" or \\"bugbear\\": \\"by which the most evident truths are so obscured that they can no longer be perceived, and the most familiar propositions so disguised that they cannot be known.\\" He says that an \\"illustrious example\\" of this style can be found in the popular philosophical work Letters Concerning Mind. :\\"A mother tells her infant, that 'two and two make four'; the child remembers the proposition, and is able to count four to all the purposes of life, till the course of his education brings him among philosophers, who fright him from his former knowledge, by telling him, that four is a certain aggregate of units; that all numbers being only the repetition of a unit, which, though not a number itself, is the parent, root, or original of all number, 'four' is the denomination assigned to a certain number of such repetitions. The only danger is, lest, when he first hears these dreadful sounds, the pupil should run away; if he has but the courage to stay till the conclusion, he will find that, when speculation has done its worst, two and two still make four.\\" No 37. Useful things easy of attainment (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 30 December 1758 Johnson says that everything people really need is plentiful and easy to reach. It is only when people strive for things beyond their reach that they have difficulty. :\\"Thus plenty is the original cause of many of our needs; and even the poverty, which is so frequent and distressful in civilised nations, proceeds often from that change of manners which opulence has produced. Nature makes us poor only when we want necessaries; but custom gives the name of poverty to the want of superfluities.\\" No 38. Cruelty shown to debtors in prison (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 6 January 1759 Johnson comments on a newspaper report that there are 20,000 debtors imprisoned in England ‚Äì that is, one in every 300 inhabitants. He estimates that the economy loses ¬£300,000 a year as a result, to say nothing of the misery inflicted on the prisoners' loved ones. He says conditions in prison are so bad that one in five prisoners dies there, and that prisons are breeding grounds for more crime. In a note to the 1761 edition, Johnson wrote that the number of debtors given in the original essay \\"...was at that time confidently published, but the authour has since found reason to question the calculation\\".Idler and Adventurer, p. 117, note 2. :\\"The monastick institutions have been often blamed, as tending to retard the increase of mankind. And, perhaps, retirement ought rarely to be permitted, except to those whose employment is consistent with abstraction, and who, though solitary, will not be idle; to those whom infirmity makes useless to the commonwealth, or to those who have paid their due proportion to society, and who, having lived for others, may be honourably dismissed to live for themselves. But whatever be the evil or the folly of these retreats, those have no right to censure them whose prisons contain greater numbers than the monasteries of other countries. It is, surely, less foolish and less criminal to permit inaction than compel it; to comply with doubtful opinions of happiness, than condemn to certain and apparent misery; to indulge the extravagancies of erroneous piety, than to multiply and enforce temptations to wickedness.\\" No 39. The various uses of the bracelet (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 13 January 1759 Bracelets bearing pictures of the wearer's husband and children are in fashion with English women. A correspondent suggests some variations on the theme. Women could wear an emblem showing their profession, favourite pastime or station in life. Or they could wear a small mirror, which would be \\"a perpetual source of delight\\". Likewise, soldiers could wear trinkets that remind them of military defeats or ignominious victories. :\\"Yet I know not whether it is the interest of the husband to solicit very earnestly a place on the bracelet. If his image be not in the heart, it is of small avail to hang it on the hand. A husband encircled with diamonds and rubies may gain some esteem, but will never excite love. He that thinks himself most secure of his wife, should be fearful of persecuting her continually with his presence. The joy of life is variety; the tenderest love requires to be rekindled by intervals of absence; and Fidelity herself will be wearied with transferring her eye only from the same man to the same picture.\\" No 40. The art of advertising exemplified (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 20 January 1759 The newspapers have become so crammed with adverts that advertisers must use more and more extravagant ploys to get noticed. Johnson quotes from several prime examples of the day. He dryly suggests that advertisers write with posterity in mind: \\"When these collections shall be read in another century, how will numberless contradictions be reconciled? and how shall fame be possibly distributed among the tailors and bodice-makers of the present age?\\" :\\"Promise, large promise, is the soul of an advertisement. I remember a 'wash-ball' that had a quality truly wonderful ‚Äì it gave an 'exquisite edge to the razor'. And there are now to be sold, 'for ready money only', some 'duvets for bed-coverings, of down, beyond comparison superior to what is called otter-down', and indeed such, that its 'many excellencies cannot be here set forth'. With one excellence we are made acquainted ‚Äî 'it is warmer than four or five blankets, and lighter than one'. There are some, however, that know the prejudice of mankind in favour of modest sincerity. The vender of the 'beautifying fluid' sells a lotion that repels pimples, washes away freckles, smooths the skin, and plumps the flesh; and yet, with a generous abhorrence of ostentation, confesses, that it will not 'restore the bloom of fifteen to a lady of fifty'.\\" No 41. Serious reflections on the death of a friend (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 27 January 1759 Someone known to Johnson has died suddenly, leaving him filled with \\"emptiness and horrour\\". He reflects that the inevitable cost of life is to outlive people one loves, and hopes that \\"the union of souls\\" may continue after death. Finding no comfort in Epicurus or Zeno, he turns to the Gospels: \\"Philosophy may infuse stubbornness, but Religion only can give patience.\\" The Yale edition of the Idler reveals that the death Johnson was writing about was that of his mother, who died on 20 or 21 January 1759.Idler and Adventurer, p. 128, note 1. :\\"Nothing is more evident than that the decays of age must terminate in death; yet there is no man, says Tully, who does not believe that he may yet live another year; and there is none who does not, upon the same principle, hope another year for his parent or his friend: but the fallacy will be in time detected; the last year, the last day, must come. It has come, and is past. The life which made my own life pleasant is at an end, and the gates of death are shut upon my prospects.\\" No 42. Perdita's complaint of her father (authorship uncertain) Published: Saturday, 3 February 1759 The writer describes how her father has destroyed her reputation. Because she is a beauty, he allowed her only a minimal education, and insists on showing her off in the hope of finding her a rich husband. Yet he also fills his house with \\"drunkenness, riot, and irreligion\\", so that his daughter is no longer received in polite society. :\\"It is a common opinion, he himself must very well know, that vices, like diseases, are often hereditary; and that the property of the one is to infect the manners, as the other poisons the springs of life.\\" No 43. Monitions on the flight of time (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 10 February 1759 Johnson says the visible reminders of time's passing that we find in nature should persuade us not to procrastinate: \\"Let him that desires to see others happy make haste to give, while his gift can be enjoyed, and remember that every moment of delay takes away something from the value of his benefaction.\\" Too often, however, this warning is given in vain. :\\"So little do we accustom ourselves to consider the effects of time, that things necessary and certain often surprise us like unexpected contingencies. We leave the beauty in her bloom, and, after an absence of twenty years, wonder, at our return, to find her faded. We meet those whom we left children, and can scarcely persuade ourselves to treat them as men. The traveller visits in age those countries through which he rambled in his youth, and hopes for merriment at the old place. The man of business, wearied with unsatisfactory prosperity, retires to the town of his nativity, and expects to play away the last years with the companions of his childhood, and recover youth in the fields, where he once was young.\\" No 44. The use of memory considered (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 17 February 1759 Johnson praises memory, without which no other form of thought would be possible. There are two stages of memory in a person's life: collecting memories, and recollecting them. The first stage is by far the more pleasant. Recalling memories is always bittersweet, since \\"good and evil are linked together, and no pleasure recurs but associated with pain\\". :\\"Much of the pleasure which the first survey of the world affords, is exhausted before we are conscious of our own felicity, or able to compare our condition with some other possible state. We have, therefore, few traces of the joy of our earliest discoveries; yet we all remember a time, when nature had so many untasted gratifications, that every excursion gave delight which, can now be found no longer, when the noise of a torrent, the rustle of a wood, the song of birds, or the play of lambs, had power to fill the attention, and suspend all perception of the course of time.\\" No 45. On painting. Portraits defended (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 24 February 1759 Some critics have called the English self-centred for preferring portraits to all other types of painting. Johnson says that, on the contrary, the preference springs from affection for others. Nonetheless, he believes other forms of painting should also be encouraged, and hopes that a prize recently offered for the best historical painting will produce good results. He considers various possible subjects for such a painting, and finally decides that Oliver Cromwell's dissolution of Parliament would be best. :\\"Genius is chiefly exerted in historical pictures; and the art of the painter of portraits is often lost in the obscurity of his subject. But it is in painting as in life; what is greatest is not always best. I should grieve to see Reynolds transfer to heroes and to goddesses, to empty splendour and to airy fiction, that art which is now employed in diffusing friendship, in reviving tenderness, in quickening the affections of the absent, and continuing the presence of the dead.\\" No 46. Molly Quick's complaint of her mistress (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 3 March 1759 Molly Quick is waiting-maid to a great lady. Although her mistress treats her kindly and passes on her finest clothes, she has one habit that exasperates Molly: \\"She never orders any thing in direct words, for she loves a sharp girl that can take a hint\\". :\\"It is impossible to give a notion of this style otherwise than by examples. One night, when she had sat writing letters till it was time to be dressed, 'Molly', said she, 'the Ladies are all to be at Court to-night in white aprons.' When she means that I should send to order the chair, she says, 'I think the streets are clean, I may venture to walk.' When she would have something put into its place, she bids me 'lay it on the floor.' If she would have me snuff the candles, she asks 'whether I think her eyes are like a cat's?' If she thinks her chocolate delayed, she talks of 'the benefit of abstinence.' If any needle-work is forgotten, she supposes 'that I have heard of the lady who died by pricking her finger.'\\" No 47. Deborah Ginger's account of city-wits (Johnson) Published: 10 March 1759 Deborah Ginger, the wife of a \\"city wit\\", writes in despair. Her husband was once a successful shopkeeper, but since discovering the theatre, he disdains his business and spends all his time watching plays or writing his own. :\\"By this course of life our credit as traders is lessened; and I cannot forbear to suspect, that my husband's honour as a wit is not much advanced, for he seems to be always the lowest of the company, and is afraid to tell his opinion till the rest have spoken. When he was behind his counter, he used to be brisk, active, and jocular, like a man that knew what he was doing, and did not fear to look another in the face; but among wits and criticks he is timorous and awkward, and hangs down his head at his own table. Dear Mr. Idler, persuade him, if you can, to return once more to his native element. Tell him, that wit will never make him rich, but that there are places where riches will always make a wit.\\" No 48. The bustle of idleness described and ridiculed (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 17 March 1759 Johnson returns to the subject of those who conceal their idleness by rushing aimlessly about. He considers two types: those who affect an interest in politics, and those who pretend to be learned. :\\"As political affairs are the highest and most extensive of temporal concerns, the mimick of a politician is more busy and important than any other trifler. Monsieur le Noir, a man who, without property or importance in any corner of the earth, has, in the present confusion of the world, declared himself a steady adherent to the French, is made miserable by a wind that keeps back the packet-boat, and still more miserable by every account of a Malouin privateer caught in his cruise; he knows well that nothing can be done or said by him which can produce any effect but that of laughter, that he can neither hasten nor retard good or evil, that his joys and sorrows have scarcely any partakers; yet such is his zeal, and such his curiosity, that he would run barefooted to Gravesend, for the sake of knowing first that the English had lost a tender, and would ride out to meet every mail from the continent, if he might be permitted to open it.\\" No 49. Marvel's journey narrated (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 24 March 1759 Johnson recounts his friend Will Marvel's story of a visit to Devonshire. According to Marvel, it was a trek filled with danger and drama. On the first day of his travels it rained, even though fair weather was predicted. On the second day, the road was full of puddles, and on the third, he was bored and lonely. On the fourth day he rode until after dark, and then had to wait a long time for someone to open the turnpike. Such catastrophes continued throughout his journey. :\\"Such are the colours in which Marvel paints his adventures. He has accustomed himself to sounding words and hyperbolical images, till he has lost the power of true description. In a road, through which the heaviest carriages pass without difficulty, and the post-boy every day and night goes and returns, he meets with hardships like those which are endured in Siberian deserts, and misses nothing of romantick danger but a giant and a dragon. When his dreadful story is told in proper terms, it is only that the way was dirty in winter, and that he experienced the common vicissitudes of rain and sunshine.\\" No 50. Marvel's journey paralleled (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 31 March 1759 Johnson says that in reality, all people are susceptible to the kind of exaggeration Marvel displayed. Exaggerating pleasures is forgivable, but exaggerating troubles is not. :\\"In the present state of the world man may pass through Shakespeare's seven stages of life, and meet nothing singular or wonderful. But such is every man's attention to himself, that what is common and unheeded, when it is only seen, becomes remarkable and peculiar when we happen to feel it.\\" No 51. Domestick greatness unattainable (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 7 April 1759 Johnson says that no man is considered great in his own household, however illustrious he may appear to the outside world. People can display great powers only in extraordinary situations. :\\"But such is the constitution of the world, that much of life must be spent in the same manner by the wise and the ignorant, the exalted and the low. Men, however distinguished by external accidents or intrinsick qualities, have all the same wants, the same pains, and, as far as the senses are consulted, the same pleasures. The petty cares and petty duties are the same in every station to every understanding, and every hour brings some occasion on which we all sink to the common level. We are all naked till we are dressed, and hungry till we are fed; and the general's triumph, and sage's disputation, end, like the humble labours of the smith or ploughman, in a dinner or in sleep.\\" No 52. Self-denial necessary (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 14 April 1759 Johnson says that although self-denial has been taken to ridiculous extremes by some religious sects, it is still necessary. :\\"To deny early and inflexibly, is the only art of checking the importunity of desire, and of preserving quiet and innocence. Innocent gratifications must be sometimes withheld; he that complies with all lawful desires will certainly lose his empire over himself, and, in time, either submit his reason to his wishes, and think all his desires lawful, or dismiss his reason as troublesome and intrusive, and resolve to snatch what he may happen to wish, without inquiring about right and wrong.\\" No 53. Mischiefs of good company (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 24 April 1759 A husband complains that his wife insists on keeping \\"good company\\" ‚Äî that is, the company of the rich and noble. After trying unsuccessfully for some time to foist herself upon them, she managed to gain acceptance from a few of the less savoury members of the aristocracy, and made her way up the social ladder from there. She now talks of nothing but her new social circle, models all her behaviour on theirs and has turned her back on her old friends. :\\"What adds to all this uneasiness is, that this expense is without use, and this vanity without honour; she forsakes houses where she might be courted, for those where she is only suffered; her equals are daily made her enemies, and her superiors will never be her friends.\\" No 54. Mrs Savecharges' complaint (authorship uncertain) Published: Saturday, 28 April 1759 Sukey Savecharges, a bride of six months, writes asking for legal advice. In their marriage contract, her husband promised to buy her a coach. After they were married, he tried to talk her out of it, saying a coach would be too expensive to maintain. When she refused to relent, he bought her the coach, but told her she would have to pay for the horses herself. Sukey asks how she can annexe two horses to the contract. :\\"Now, though I am convinced I might make a worse use of part of the pin-money, than by extending my bounty towards the support of so useful a part of the brute creation; yet, like a true-born Englishwoman, I am so tenacious of my rights and privileges, and moreover so good a friend to the gentlemen of the law, that I protest, Mr Idler, sooner than tamely give up the point, and be quibbled out of my right, I will receive my pin-money, as it were, with one hand, and pay it to them with the other; provided they will give me, or, which is the same thing, my trustees, encouragement to commence a suit against this dear, frugal husband of mine.\\" No 55. Authors' mortifications (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 5 May 1759 An author describes how he spent eight years researching a book on natural history. At first he read portions of his work in progress to his friends, but was discouraged by their criticism. He finished the work in secret and expected publishers to compete fiercely for the rights, but he found nothing but indifference. His book has still not been printed, and he has been indicted for kicking a publisher. He is convinced that his friends must have conspired against him, and asks the Idler what he should do. :\\"I took my lodgings near the house of the Royal Society, and expected every morning a visit from the president. I walked in the Park, and wondered that I overheard no mention of the great naturalist. At last I visited a noble earl, and told him of my work: he answered, that he was under an engagement never to subscribe. I was angry to have that refused which I did not mean to ask, and concealed my design of making him immortal. I went next day to another, and, in resentment of my late affront, offered to prefix his name to my new book. He said, coldly, that 'he did not understand those things'; another thought, 'there were too many books'; and another would 'talk with me when the races were over'.\\" No 56. Virtuosos whimsical (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 12 May 1759 Johnson mocks the behaviour of collectors at an auction, and considers both the good and bad effects of collecting. On the one hand, it \\"fills the mind with trifling ambition\\"; on the other, it \\"brings many things to notice that would be neglected, and, by fixing the thoughts upon intellectual pleasures, resists the natural encroachments of sensuality.\\" :\\"The novice is often surprised to see what minute and unimportant discriminations increase or diminish value. An irregular contortion of a turbinated shell, which common eyes pass unregarded, will ten times treble its price in the imagination of philosophers. Beauty is far from operating upon collectors as upon low and vulgar minds, even where beauty might be thought the only quality that could deserve notice. Among the shells that please by their variety of colours, if one can be found accidentally deformed by a cloudy spot, it is boasted as the pride of the collection. China is sometimes purchased for little less than its weight in gold, only because it is old, though neither less brittle, nor better painted, than the modern; and brown china is caught up with ecstasy, though no reason can be imagined for which it should be preferred to common vessels of common clay.\\" No 57. Character of Sophron (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 19 May 1759 Johnson describes his companion Sophron (\\"wisdom\\"), who exemplifies prudence. He is frugal, never gossips, never takes sides in a dispute or gives advice. Yet while this approach to life has kept him safe from disadvantages, it has brought him no advantages either. :\\"Thus Sophron creeps along, neither loved nor hated, neither favoured nor opposed: he has never attempted to grow rich, for fear of growing poor; and has raised no friends, for fear of making enemies.\\" No 58. Expectations of pleasure frustrated (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 26 May 1759 Johnson observes that \\"pleasure is very seldom found where it is sought\\". Gatherings of humourists are always disappointing because the premeditation kills merriment. Wit only succeeds when it is spontaneous. Likewise, pleasure trips and visits to old friends seldom live up to one's expectations. :\\"Merriment is always the effect of a sudden impression. The jest which is expected is already destroyed. The most active imagination will be sometimes torpid, under the frigid influence of melancholy, and sometimes occasions will be wanting to tempt the mind, however volatile, to sallies and excursions. Nothing was ever said with uncommon felicity, but by the co- operation of chance; and, therefore, wit, as well as valour, must be content to share its honours with fortune.\\" No 59. Books fall into neglect (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 2 June 1759 Johnson discusses the fickleness of literary fame. Some authors' reputations fade because they were never deserved in the first place. Others became famous by writing about fashionable topics, and fell out of favour when people lost interest in their subject. :\\"He that writes upon general principles, or delivers universal truths, may hope to be often read, because his work will be equally useful at all times and in every country; but he cannot expect it to be received with eagerness, or to spread with rapidity, because desire can have no particular stimulation: that which is to be loved long, must be loved with reason rather than with passion. He that lays his labours out upon temporary subjects, easily finds readers, and quickly loses them; for what should make the book valued when the subject is no more?\\" No 60. Minim the critic (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 9 June 1759 To show how easy it is to become a critic, Johnson describes the career of Dick Minim. A former brewer's apprentice, Minim inherited a fortune and \\"resolved to be a man of wit and humour\\". He learned everything he needed to know about literature and drama by hanging around coffeehouses and listening to the gossip. By repeating the same platitudes as everyone else and pointing out the obvious, he earned an honoured place among critics. :\\"This profession has one recommendation peculiar to itself, that it gives vent to malignity without real mischief. No genius was ever blasted by the breath of criticks. The poison which, if confined, would have burst the heart, fumes away in empty hisses, and malice is set at ease with very little danger to merit. The critick is the only man whose triumph is without another's pain, and whose greatness does not rise upon another's ruin.\\" No 61. Minim the critic (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 15 June 1759,., Minim's story continues. Having reached the zenith of his career, he decided that England needed an academy to set artistic standards, like those found on the continent. Until such an academy can be formed, he is serving as the president of a small critical society. He withholds judgement on new books until he sees how they succeed commercially, and he takes in aspiring authors to whom he gives clich√©d and conflicting advice. :\\"Minim is not so confident of his rules of judgment as not very eagerly to catch new light from the name of the author. He is commonly so prudent as to spare those whom he cannot resist, unless, as will sometimes happen, he finds the publick combined against them. But a fresh pretender to fame he is strongly inclined to censure, till his own honour requires that he commend him. Till he knows the success of a composition, he intrenches himself in general terms; there are some new thoughts and beautiful passages, but there is likewise much which he would have advised the author to expunge. He has several favourite epithets, of which he has never settled the meaning, but which are very commodiously applied to books which he has not read, or cannot understand. One is 'manly', another is 'dry', another 'stiff', and another 'flimsy'; sometimes he discovers delicacy of style, and sometimes meets with 'strange expressions'.\\" No 62. Ranger's account of the vanity of riches (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 23 June 1759 Tim Ranger writes to dispute the claim that money brings happiness. He lived the modest life of a scholar until he inherited a massive fortune from his uncle. He bought fine clothes, but found they brought him more anxiety than pleasure. He tried to be a rake, but found himself turning into a drunkard. He kept racing horses, but soon grew bored with it. He then began building a grand house, and then found that the architects were cheating him. He ends with a promise to conclude his history another time. :\\"But experience is the test by which all the philosophers of the present age agree, that speculation must be tried; and I may be, therefore, allowed to doubt the power of money, since I have been a long time rich, and have not yet found that riches can make me happy.\\" No 63. Progress of arts and language (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 30 June 1759 Johnson says that art and language flourish only after basic human needs have been met. Both, however, progress \\"through improvement to degeneracy\\". The English language started out \\"artless and simple, unconnected and concise\\". Since the time of Chaucer, the language has steadily become far more refined, but there is now a danger of affectation. :\\"Then begin the arts of rhetorick and poetry, the regulation of figures, the selection of words, the modulation of periods, the graces of transition, the complication of clauses, and all the delicacies of style and subtilties of composition, useful while they advance perspicuity, and laudable while they increase pleasure, but easy to be refined by needless scrupulosity till they shall more embarrass the writer than assist the reader or delight him.\\" No 64. Ranger's complaint concluded (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 7 July 1759 Tim Ranger (see no 62) continues his tale. After selling his racehorses, he resolved to be a \\"fine gentleman\\". He began frequenting coffeehouses, learned to force himself to laugh, and took up betting and the opera. He became patron to a famous violinist, but lost his patronage by refusing to bail him out of debtor's prison. He also tried sitting for his portrait, but none of the artists he found pleased him. After this he took up collecting shells and fossils, but the jealousy of his fellow collectors forced him out. Finally he sought popularity by giving lavish dinner parties, only to find himself under the thumb of his French cook. Despairing, he asks the Idler what he can do now. :\\"In this new scene of life my great labour was to learn to laugh. I had been used to consider laughter as the effect of merriment; but I soon learned that it is one of the arts of adulation, and, from laughing only to show that I was pleased, I now began to laugh when I wished to please. This was at first very difficult. I sometimes heard the story with dull indifference, and, not exalting myself to merriment by due gradations, burst out suddenly into an awkward noise, which was not always favourably interpreted. Sometimes I was behind the rest of the company, and lost the grace of laughing by delay, and sometimes, when I began at the right time, was deficient in loudness or in length. But, by diligent imitation of the best models, I attained at last such flexibility of muscles, that I was always a welcome auditor of a story, and got the reputation of a good-natured fellow.\\" No 65. Fate of posthumous works (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 14 July 1759 The posthumous publication of the Earl of Clarendon's history of the English Civil War leads Johnson to consider the varying fates of posthumous works. Some authors leave their manuscripts to their heirs, only for the survivors to store them away or burn them for fuel. Other writers have their work mutilated by editors. Johnson advises that writers \\"tell us what they have learned while they are yet able to tell it, and trust their reputation only to themselves.\\" :\\"Yet there are some works which the authors must consign unpublished to posterity, however uncertain be the event, however hopeless be the trust. He that writes the history of his own times, if he adheres steadily to truth, will write that which his own times will not easily endure. He must be content to reposite his book, till all private passions shall cease, and love and hatred give way to curiosity.\\" No 66. Loss of ancient writings (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 21 July 1759 Johnson suggests that we should not lament the fact that so little ancient literature has survived. The \\"most esteemed\\" works of the time have come down to us, and if we had kept everything from antiquity, we would have no room for modern endeavours. :\\"Of the ancients, enough remains to excite our emulation and direct our endeavours. Many of the works which time has left us, we know to have been these that were most esteemed, and which antiquity itself considered as models; so that, having the originals, we may without much regret lose the imitations. The obscurity which the want of contemporary writers often produces, only darkens single passages, and those commonly of slight importance. The general tendency of every piece may be known; and though that diligence deserves praise which leaves nothing unexamined, yet its miscarriages are not much to be lamented; for the most useful truths are always universal, and unconnected with accidents and customs.\\" No 67. Scholar's journal (Langton) Published: Saturday, 28 July 1759 Langton offers another fictional diary, this time of a scholar. The subject resolves to spend three days writing serious treatises on logic and the mind. Instead, he becomes distracted by reading, discussions with friends and watching life on the streets of London. As a consequence, he writes several poems he had not planned. Langton says the diary proves that people are more productive when they pursue what truly interests them. The scholar Langton describes is suspected by the editors of the Yale edition of being Johnson himself, who had a \\"habit of making resolutions and condemning himself for breaking them\\".Idler and Adventurer, p. 207, note 1. :\\"...when we contemplate the inquisitive nature of the human mind, and its perpetual impatience of all restraint, it may be doubted whether the faculties may not be contracted by confining the attention; and whether it may not sometimes be proper to risk the certainty of little for the chance of much. Acquisitions of knowledge, like blazes of genius, are often fortuitous. Those who had proposed to themselves a methodical course of reading, light by accident on a new book, which seizes their thoughts and kindles their curiosity, and opens an unexpected prospect, to which the way which they had prescribed to themselves would never have conducted them.\\" No 68. History of translation (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 4 August 1759 Johnson reviews the history of translation, which he says is the most modern of the arts. (Much of what he says here has since been shown to be incorrect.) :\\"The Greeks for a time travelled into Egypt, but they translated no books from the Egyptian language; and when the Macedonians had overthrown the empire of Persia, the countries that became subject to Grecian dominion studied only the Grecian literature. The books of the conquered nations, if they had any among them, sunk into oblivion; Greece considered herself as the mistress, if not as the parent of arts, her language contained all that was supposed to be known, and, except the sacred writings of the Old Testament, I know not that the library of Alexandria adopted any thing from a foreign tongue.\\" No 69. History of translation (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 11 August 1759 Johnson continues his history of translation. The art of translation into English began with Chaucer, who translated Boethius' Comforts of Philosophy. However, Johnson criticises this translation as \\"nothing higher than a version strictly literal\\". When William Caxton began printing books in English, he at first concentrated solely on translations of French works. Not until the Restoration, however, did translators switch their attention from literal accuracy to elegance. :\\"There is undoubtedly a mean to be observed. Dryden saw very early that closeness best preserved an author's sense, and that freedom best exhibited his spirit; he, therefore, will deserve the highest praise, who can give a representation at once faithful and pleasing, who can convey the same thoughts with the same graces, and who, when he translates, changes nothing but the language.\\" No 70. Hard words defended (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 18 August 1759 Johnson says people who are confused by hard words in books should ask themselves whether it is the author's fault or theirs. An author writing for a learned audience is entitled to use harder words than one writing for the ignorant. Moreover, \\"every science and every trade\\" must of necessity have its own vocabulary. The simplest language is not always the clearest. :\\"That the vulgar express their thoughts clearly, is far from true; and what perspicuity can be found among them proceeds not from the easiness of their language, but the shallowness of their thoughts. He that sees a building as a common spectator, contents himself with relating that it is great or little, mean or splendid, lofty or low; all these words are intelligible and common, but they convey no distinct or limited ideas; if he attempts, without the terms of architecture, to delineate the parts, or enumerate the ornaments, his narration at once becomes unintelligible. The terms, indeed, generally displease, because they are understood by few; but they are little understood, only because few that look upon an edifice examine its parts, or analyse its columns into their members.\\" No 71. Dick Shifter's rural excursion (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 25 August 1759 Dick Shifter, a native of Cheapside, decides to spend a summer in the country to find peace and simplicity. Instead, he finds that the food is bad, prices are high, newspapers are impossible to get, and the people treat him with suspicion. He returns to London after just five days. :\\"Finding his walks thus interrupted, he was inclined to ride, and, being pleased with the appearance of a horse that was grazing in a neighbouring meadow, inquired the owner, who warranted him sound, and would not sell him, but that he was too fine for a plain man. Dick paid down the price, and, riding out to enjoy the evening, fell with his new horse into a ditch; they got out with difficulty, and, as he was going to mount again, a countryman looked at the horse, and perceived him to be blind. Dick went to the seller, and demanded back his money; but was told, that a man who rented his ground must do the best for himself; that his landlord had his rent though the year was barren; and that, whether horses had eyes or no, he should sell them to the highest bidder.\\" No 72. Regulation of memory (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 1 September 1759 Man has two problems with memory: he cannot remember the things he wants to remember, and he remembers things he would rather forget. Johnson thinks people would benefit more from increased forgetfulness than from increased memory. If we could stop brooding on painful and useless memories, we would be better able to learn things we need to know. People should try to banish troublesome memories by keeping busy with new pursuits. :\\"The incursions of troublesome thoughts are often violent and importunate; and it is not easy to a mind accustomed to their inroads to expel them immediately by putting better images into motion; but this enemy of quiet is above all others weakened by every defeat; the reflection which has been once overpowered and ejected, seldom returns with any formidable vehemence.\\" No 73. Tranquil's use of riches (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 8 September 1759 Johnson says that although wealth is now a universal goal, it cannot buy any more happiness than it did when poverty was thought to be virtuous. He illustrates this point with the story of Tom Tranquil. Tom inherited a huge fortune when he came of age, and his friends set about spending it for him. He is, however, utterly indifferent to their choices. :\\"A companion, who had just learned the names of the Italian masters, runs from sale to sale, and buys pictures, for which Mr Tranquil pays, without inquiring where they shall be hung. Another fills his garden with statues, which Tranquil wishes away, but dares not remove. One of his friends is learning architecture by building him a house, which he passed by, and inquired to whom it belonged; another has been for three years digging canals and raising mounts, cutting trees down in one place, and planting them in another, on which Tranquil looks with a serene indifference, without asking what will be the cost. Another projector tells him that a waterwork, like that of Versailles, will complete the beauties of his seat, and lays his draughts before him: Tranquil turns his eyes upon them, and the artist begins his explanations; Tranquil raises no objections, but orders him to begin the work, that he may escape from talk which he does not understand.\\" No 74. Memory rarely deficient (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 15 September 1759 Johnson says that nobody is ever satisfied with the quality of their memory, but that actual weakness of memory is fairly rare. He criticises those who mark their books, or copy passages in a commonplace book, to remember them better. It is better to pay close attention and enjoy what one is reading. :\\"It is the practice of many readers to note, in the margin of their books, the most important passages, the strongest arguments, or the brightest sentiments. Thus they load their minds with superfluous attention, repress the vehemence of curiosity by useless deliberation, and by frequent interruption break the current of narration or the chain of reason, and at last close the volume, and forget the passages and marks together.\\" No 75. Gelaleddin of Bassora (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 22 September 1759 While studying in Bassora, Gelaleddin becomes celebrated for his scholarship and is offered a professor's post. Not wanting to spend his life in obscurity in a provincial town, he decides to go to Tauris, where he thinks he will achieve greater glory. Instead, he is received with indifference and cannot find work. He returns home, but finds that his cold reception in Tauris has caused the people of Bassora to think they must have over-rated his abilities. :\\"It was now known in the neighbourhood that Gelaleddin was returned, and he sat for some days in expectation that the learned would visit him for consultation, or the great for entertainment. But who will be pleased or instructed in the mansions of poverty? He then frequented places of publick resort, and endeavoured to attract notice by the copiousness of his talk. The sprightly were silenced, and went away to censure, in some other place, his arrogance and his pedantry; and the dull listened quietly for a while, and then wondered why any man should take pains to obtain so much knowledge which would never do him good.\\" No 76. False criticisms on painting (Reynolds) Published: Saturday, 29 September 1759 Reynolds mocks critics and connoisseurs who apply narrow rules to painting. If a person does not have artistic sensibilities, rules will not take their place. :\\"'This', says he, 'is esteemed the most excellent of all the cartoons; what nobleness, what dignity, there is in that figure of St Paul! and yet what an addition to that nobleness could Raffaelle have given, had the art of contrast been known in his time! but, above all, the flowing line which constitutes grace and beauty! You would not have then seen an upright figure standing equally on both legs, and both hands stretched forward in the same direction, and his drapery, to all appearance, without the least art of disposition.' The following picture is the Charge to Peter. 'Here', says he, 'are twelve upright figures; what a pity it is that Raffaelle was not acquainted with the pyramidal principle! He would then have contrived the figures in the middle to have been on higher ground, or the figures at the extremities stooping or lying, which would not only have formed the group into the shape of a pyramid, but likewise contrasted the standing figures. Indeed,' added he, 'I have often lamented that so great a genius as Raffaelle had not lived in this enlightened age, since the art has been reduced to principles, and had had his education in one of the modern academies; what glorious works might we have then expected from his divine pencil!'\\" No 77. Easy writing (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 6 October 1759 Johnson says that everyone admires easy poetry, but no one can define what it is. He suggests that it be defined as 'that in which natural thoughts are expressed without violence to the language,' and gives contrasting examples of easy and difficult poetry. :\\"It is the prerogative of easy poetry to be understood as long as the language lasts; but modes of speech, which owe their prevalence only to modish folly, or to the eminence of those that use them, die away with their inventors, and their meaning, in a few years, is no longer known.\\" No 78. Steady, Snug, Startle, Solid and Misty (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 13 October 1759 A correspondent called Robin Spritely describes the conversation of five characters he met while visiting a mineral spring over the summer. Tom Steady is \\"a vehement assertor of uncontroverted truth\\"; Dick Snug interrupts stories to make trite observations; Will Startle responds to everything with hyperbolic expressions of disgust or delight; Jack Solid \\"utters nothing but quotations\\", though he has a limited store of them; and Dick Misty gives long and obscure explanations of mundane points. :\\"Dick Snug is a man of sly remark and pithy sententiousness: he never immerges himself in the stream of conversation, but lies to catch his companions in the eddy: he is often very successful in breaking narratives and confounding eloquence. A gentleman, giving the history of one of his acquaintance, made mention of a lady that had many lovers: 'Then', said Dick, 'she was either handsome or rich.' This observation being well received, Dick watched the progress of the tale; and, hearing of a man lost in a shipwreck, remarked, that 'no man was ever drowned upon dry land'.\\" No 79. Grand style of painting (Reynolds) Published: Saturday, 20 October 1759 Reynolds says painters must aim at more than simply imitating nature. He claims that Dutch painting is inferior to Italian painting because the former focuses on \\"petty peculiarities\\", while the latter \\"attends only to the invariable, the great and general ideas.\\" Michelangelo, \\"the Homer of painting\\", is also the least naturalistic of the great painters. :Imitate nature \\"is the invariable rule; but I know none who have explained in what manner this rule is to be understood; the consequence of which is, that every one takes it in the most obvious sense, that objects are represented naturally when they have such relief that they seem real. It may appear strange, perhaps, to hear this sense of the rule disputed; but it must be considered, that, if the excellency of a painter consisted only in this kind of imitation, painting must lose its rank, and be no longer considered as a liberal art, and sister to poetry, this imitation being merely mechanical, in which the slowest intellect is always sure to succeed best: for the painter of genius cannot stoop to drudgery, in which the understanding has no part; and what pretence has the art to claim kindred with poetry, but by its powers over the imagination?\\" No 80. Ladies' journey to London (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 27 October 1759 The upper classes are making their annual return to London after a summer in the countryside. The week before the homecoming has much anticipation. Most excited of all is \\"the virgin whom the last summer released from her governess\\" and who is appearing in London society for the first time. Johnson warns her that her expectations of \\"uninterrupted happiness\\" will be disappointed, but that she will have much to learn from the city if she opens her mind to it. :\\"The uniform necessities of human nature produce, in a great measure, uniformity of life, and for part of the day make one place like another; to dress and to undress, to eat and to sleep, are the same in London as in the country. The supernumerary hours have, indeed, a great variety both of pleasure and of pain. The stranger, gazed on by multitudes at her first appearance in the Park, is, perhaps, on the highest summit of female happiness; but how great is the anguish when the novelty of another face draws her worshippers away!\\" No 81. Indian's speech to his countrymen (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 3 November 1759 Johnson imagines an Indian chief's speech to his tribe as the British advance on Quebec. The Europeans who have stolen their land and oppressed them have now turned upon one another. The chief urges his people to \\"remember that the death of every European delivers the country from a tyrant and a robber; for what is the claim of either nation, but the claim of the vulture to the leveret, of the tiger to the fawn?\\" :\\"Some there are who boast their humanity, and content themselves to seize our chases and fisheries, who drive us from every tract of ground where fertility and pleasantness invite them to settle, and make no war upon us except when we intrude upon our own lands. Others pretend to have purchased a right of residence and tyranny; but surely the insolence of such bargains is more offensive than the avowed and open dominion of force. What reward can induce the possessour of a country to admit a stranger more powerful than himself? Fraud or terrour must operate in such contracts; either they promised protection which they never have afforded, or instruction which they never imparted.\\" No 82. The true idea of beauty (Reynolds) Published: Saturday, 10 November 1759 Reynolds suggests that every animal and plant species, and every race of human beings, has a certain \\"fixed or determinate\\" form, and that the closer a particular specimen is to this form, the more beautiful we think it is. It is not possible to say that a particular species or race is more beautiful than another; we can only compare individuals within the same group. :\\"He who says a swan is more beautiful than a dove, means little more than that he has more pleasure in seeing a swan than a dove, either from the stateliness of its motions, or its being a more rare bird; and he who gives the preference to the dove, does it from some association of ideas of innocence that he always annexes to the dove; but, if he pretends to defend the preference he gives to one or the other by endeavouring to prove that this more beautiful form proceeds from a particular gradation of magnitude, undulation of a curve, or direction of a line, or whatever other conceit of his imagination he shall fix on as a criterion of form, he will be continually contradicting himself, and find at last, that the great Mother of Nature will not be subjected to such narrow rules. Among the various reasons why we prefer one part of her works to another, the most general, I believe, is habit and custom; custom makes, in a certain sense, white black, and black white; it is custom alone determines our preference of the colour of the Europeans to the Aethiopians; and they, for the same reason, prefer their own colour to ours.\\" No 83. Scruple, Wormwood, Sturdy and Gentle (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 17 November 1759 The description of conversationalists at the mineral spring, which began in No 78 with \\"Steady, Snug, Startle, Solid, and Misty\\", continues with four new characters. Sim Scruple \\"lives in a continual equipoise of doubt\\" and is constantly questioning received ideas, while Dick Wormwood finds fault with every aspect of contemporary society. Bob Sturdy refuses to be swayed by argument or to justify his positions; he merely repeats his assertions again and again. On the other hand, Phil Gentle has no opinions of his own, but expresses agreement with everyone who speaks to him. :\\"Bob is the most formidable disputant of the whole company; for, without troubling himself to search for reasons, he tires his antagonist with repeated affirmations. When Bob has been attacked for an hour with all the powers of eloquence and reason, and his position appears to all but himself utterly untenable, he always closes the debate with his first declaration, introduced by a stout preface of contemptuous civility. 'All this is very judicious; you may talk, Sir, as you please; but I will still say what I said at first.'\\" No 84. Biography, how best performed (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 24 November 1759 Johnson says that autobiography is more valuable than biography, because it concerns the inner life as well as the outer. He says that the risk of writers falsifying their autobiographies is not as great as people suppose, because readers are vigilant against any signs of vanity. :\\"The mischievous consequences of vice and folly, of irregular desires and predominant passions, are best discovered by those relations which are levelled with the general surface of life, which tell not how any man became great, but how he was made happy; not how he lost the favour of his prince, but how he became discontented with himself.\\" No 85. Books multiplied by useless compilations (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 1 December 1759 Johnson says that too many of the books being published are merely compilations of earlier works. Compilations can sometimes be useful, since 'particles of science are often very widely scattered,' but most of those being produced now 'only serve to distract choice without supplying any real want.' :\\"It is observed that 'a corrupt society has many laws'; I know not whether it is not equally true, that 'an ignorant age has many books'. When the treasures of ancient knowledge lie unexamined, and original authors are neglected and forgotten, compilers and plagiaries are encouraged, who give us again what we had before, and grow great by setting before us what our own sloth had hidden from our view.\\" No 86. Miss Heartless' want of a lodging (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 8 December 1759 Peggy Heartless, a new bride, describes her and her husband's attempts to find a suitable flat in London. They have asked the advice of a friend, who rejects every place they look at for trivial reasons. In the meantime, they must endure the humiliation of living in lodgings on the second floor of a building. :\\"Inconveniencies are often balanced by some advantage: the elevation of my apartments furnished a subject for conversation, which, without some such help, we should have been in danger of wanting. Lady Stately told us how many years had passed since she climbed so many steps. Miss Airy ran to the window, and thought it charming to see the walkers so little in the street; and Miss Gentle went to try the same experiment, and screamed to find herself so far above the ground.\\" No 87. Amazonian bravery revived (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 15 December 1759 Johnson says there is no chance of English women reviving the civilisation of the Amazons. Those English women who can live without men are not civil enough to one another to keep a society together. :\\"I do not mean to censure the ladies of England as defective in knowledge or in spirit, when I suppose them unlikely to revive the military honours of their sex. The character of the ancient Amazons was rather terrible than lovely; the hand could not be very delicate that was only employed in drawing the bow and brandishing the battle- axe; their power was maintained by cruelty, their courage was deformed by ferocity, and their example only shows that men and women live best together.\\" No 88. What have ye done? (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 22 December 1759 Johnson says people who aim to do great things for humanity often end up feeling that they have not done as much as they should. This should not discourage us, however; the important thing is to do whatever we can. :\\"If I had ever found any of the self-contemners much irritated or pained by the consciousness of their meanness, I should have given them consolation by observing, that a little more than nothing is as much as can be expected from a being, who, with respect to the multitudes about him, is himself little more than nothing. Every man is obliged by the Supreme Master of the universe to improve all the opportunities of good which are afforded him, and to keep in continual activity such abilities as are bestowed upon him. But he has no reason to repine, though his abilities are small and his opportunities few. He that has improved the virtue, or advanced the happiness of one fellow- creature, he that has ascertained a single moral proposition, or added one useful experiment to natural knowledge, may be contented with his own performance, and, with respect to mortals like himself, may demand, like Augustus, to be dismissed at his departure with applause.\\" No 89. Physical evil moral good (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 29 December 1759 Johnson says that the purpose of pain and misery is to encourage the development of virtue. Pain from overindulgence leads to sobriety; the misery that results from lawlessness causes laws and justice to be enforced; poverty encourages charity; and despair of earthly help causes people to turn to God. :\\"A state of innocence and happiness is so remote from all that we have ever seen, that though we can easily conceive it possible, and may, therefore, hope to attain it, yet our speculations upon it must be general and confused. We can discover that where there is universal innocence, there will probably be universal happiness; for, why should afflictions be permitted to infest beings who are not in danger of corruption from blessings, and where there is no use of terrour nor cause of punishment? But in a world like ours, where our senses assault us, and our hearts betray us, we should pass on from crime to crime, heedless and remorseless, if misery did not stand in our way, and our own pains admonish us of our folly.\\" No 90. Rhetorical action considered (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 5 January 1760 Johnson comments on the fact that the English use less body language than other Europeans. Many tutors have sprung up offering to teach it, in the belief that it makes speech more persuasive. Johnson disputes this, saying such gestures are \\"useless and ostentatious\\". :\\"The use of English oratory is only at the bar, in the parliament, and in the church. Neither the judges of our laws nor the representatives of our people would be much affected by laboured gesticulation, or believe any man the more because he rolled his eyes, or puffed his cheeks, or spread abroad his arms, or stamped the ground, or thumped his breast, or turned his eyes sometimes to the ceiling and sometimes to the floor. Upon men intent only upon truth, the arm of an orator has little power; a credible testimony, or a cogent argument will overcome all the art of modulation, and all the violence of contortion.\\" No 91. Sufficiency of the English language (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 12 January 1760 Johnson laments the English prejudice in favour of foreign authors and languages. English literature is much richer than English scholars give it credit for, and any art or science can be more easily learned in English than in a foreign language. :\\"The riches of the English language are much greater than they are commonly supposed. Many useful and valuable books lie buried in shops and libraries, unknown and unexamined, unless some lucky compiler opens them by chance, and finds an easy spoil of wit and learning. I am far from intending to insinuate, that other languages are not necessary to him who aspires to eminence, and whose whole life is devoted to study; but to him who reads only for amusement, or whose purpose is not to deck himself with the honours of literature, but to be qualified for domestick usefulness, and sit down content with subordinate reputation, we have authors sufficient to fill up all the vacancies of his time, and gratify most of his wishes for information.\\" No 92. Nature of cunning (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 19 January 1760 Johnson says that people who cannot be wise try to be cunning instead; yet the two are as different as \\"twilight from open day\\". The cunning must always be furtive and fearful, while the wise are open and confident. Cunning people evade questions, pretend to be experts on subjects they know nothing about, and trust no one. :\\"He that walks in the sunshine goes boldly forward by the nearest way; he sees that where the path is straight and even, he may proceed in security, and where it is rough and crooked he easily complies with the turns, and avoids the obstructions. But the traveller in the dusk fears more as he sees less; he knows there may be danger, and, therefore, suspects that he is never safe, tries every step before he fixes his foot, and shrinks at every noise lest violence should approach him. Wisdom comprehends at once the end and the means, estimates easiness or difficulty, and is cautious or confident in due proportion. Cunning discovers little at a time, and has no other means of certainty than multiplication of stratagems and superfluity of suspicion. The man of cunning always considers that he can never be too safe, and, therefore, always keeps himself enveloped in a mist, impenetrable, as he hopes, to the eye of rivalry or curiosity.\\" No 93. Sam Softly's history (Warton) Published: Saturday, 26 January 1760 Sam Softly, a sugar-baker, inherited a fortune and retired to a country house in Kentish Town. He spends his days driving around the countryside in his chaise, criticising the houses he passes and on the conduct of other drivers. :\\"Misapplied genius most commonly proves ridiculous. Had Sam, as Nature intended, contentedly continued in the calmer and less conspicuous pursuits of sugar-baking, he might have been a respectable and useful character. At present he dissipates his life in a specious idleness, which neither improves himself nor his friends. Those talents, which might have benefited society, he exposes to contempt by false pretensions. He affects pleasures which he cannot enjoy, and is acquainted only with those subjects on which he has no right to talk, and which it is no merit to understand.\\" No 94. Obstructions of learning (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 2 February 1760 Johnson observes that learning is \\"at once honoured and neglected\\". Some do not have the time to pursue it; others are seduced by other entertainments; still others want to learn, but are discouraged by the \\"continual multiplication of books\\". :\\"It is the great excellence of learning, that it borrows very little from time or place; it is not confined to season or to climate, to cities or to the country, but may be cultivated and enjoyed where no other pleasure can be obtained. But this quality, which constitutes much of its value, is one occasion of neglect; what may be done at all times with equal propriety, is deferred from day to day, till the mind is gradually reconciled to the omission, and the attention is turned to other objects. Thus habitual idleness gains too much power to be conquered, and the soul shrinks from the idea of intellectual labour and intenseness of meditation.\\" No 95. Tim Wainscot's son a fine gentleman (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 9 February 1760 Tim Wainscot, a widowed trader, writes to complain of his son's airs. The boy worked hard in the family shop until some friends made him feel ashamed of working in commerce. He now aspires to be a gentleman, neglects his work and squanders his father's money. :\\"All this is very provoking; and yet all this might be borne, if the boy could support his pretensions. But, whatever he may think, he is yet far from the accomplishments which he has endeavoured to purchase at so dear a rate. I have watched him in publick places. He sneaks in like a man that knows he is where he should not be; he is proud to catch the slightest salutation, and often claims it when it is not intended. Other men receive dignity from dress, but my booby looks always more meanly for his finery. Dear Mr. Idler, tell him what must at last become of a fop, whom pride will not suffer to be a trader, and whom long habits in a shop forbid to be a gentleman.\\" No 96. Hacho of Lapland (Warton) Published: Saturday, 16 February 1760 Hacho, the king of Lapland, was a fierce warrior and a wise scholar until he discovered honey. After this, his tastes became gradually more refined until he lived a life of languor and pleasure-seeking. When the enemy invaded, he was unable to resist; he was killed and his kingdom conquered. :\\"Nor was he less celebrated for his prudence and wisdom. Two of his proverbs are yet remembered and repeated among Laplanders. To express the vigilance of the Supreme Being, he was wont to say, 'Odin's belt is always buckled'. To show that the most prosperous condition of life is often hazardous, his lesson was, 'When you slide on the smoothest ice, beware of pits beneath'. He consoled his countrymen, when they were once preparing to leave the frozen deserts of Lapland, and resolved to seek some warmer climate, by telling them, that the Eastern nations, notwithstanding their boasted fertility, passed every night amidst the horrours of anxious apprehension, and were inexpressibly affrighted, and almost stunned, every morning, with the noise of the sun while he was rising.\\" No 97. Narratives of travellers considered (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 23 February 1760 Johnson observes that \\"few books disappoint their readers more than the narrations of travellers\\", as their content is usually either too general or too trivial. Travel writers \\"should remember that the great object of remark is human life\\". :\\"This is the common style of those sons of enterprise, who visit savage countries, and range through solitude and desolation; who pass a desert, and tell that it is sandy; who cross a valley, and find that it is green. There are others of more delicate sensibility, that visit only the realms of elegance and softness; that wander through Italian palaces, and amuse the gentle reader with catalogues of pictures; that hear masses in magnificent churches, and recount the number of the pillars or variegations of the pavement. And there are yet others, who, in disdain of trifles, copy inscriptions elegant and rude, ancient and modern; and transcribe into their book the walls of every edifice, sacred or civil. He that reads these books must consider his labour as its own reward; for he will find nothing on which attention can fix, or which memory can retain.\\" No 98. Sophia Heedful (authorship uncertain) Published: Saturday, 1 March 1760 Sophia, the daughter of a gentleman, was taken in by her bachelor uncle after her father's death. Her uncle refused to consent to her marriage, and hinted that she would inherit his fortune. However, he died intestate, and the money went to a closer relative. Sophia does not know where to go; she is too well educated to be a servant, and too poor to associate with her former social circle. :\\"Thus excluded from all hopes of living in the manner with which I have so long flattered myself, I am doubtful what method I shall take to procure a decent maintenance. I have been educated in a manner that has set me above a state of servitude, and my situation renders me unfit for the company of those with whom I have hitherto conversed. But, though disappointed in my expectations, I do not despair. I will hope that assistance may still be obtained for innocent distress, and that friendship, though rare, is yet not impossible to be found.\\" No 99. Ortogrul of Basra (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 8 March 1760 Ortogrul is wandering through the streets of Baghdad when he finds his way to the vizier's palace. Seeing the flattery in which the vizier revels, he makes up his mind to become rich. Advised in a dream to seek gradual increase of wealth, he becomes a merchant and works all his life to build up his fortune. Finally he attracts the fawning admirers he wanted, but they bring him no happiness because he cannot believe them. :\\"They tell thee that thou art wise; but what does wisdom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wise have very little power of flattering themselves. That man is surely the most wretched of the sons of wretchedness, who lives with his own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to reconcile him to himself by praise and veneration.\\" No 100. The good sort of woman (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 15 March 1760 After a long bachelorhood, Tim Warner resolved to marry \\"only in compliance with my reason\\". He drew up a list of \\"female virtues and vices\\" and sought a woman who would be evenly balanced between the two. He finally chose Miss Gentle, but after they were married, he found himself bored by her bland temperament. :\\"Every hour of the day has its employment inviolably appropriated; nor will any importunity persuade her to walk in the garden at the time which she has devoted to her needlework, or to sit up stairs in that part of the forenoon which she has accustomed herself to spend in the back parlour. She allows herself to sit half an hour after breakfast, and an hour after dinner; while I am talking or reading to her, she keeps her eye upon her watch, and when the minute of departure comes, will leave an argument unfinished, or the intrigue of a play unravelled. She once called me to supper when I was watching an eclipse, and summoned me at another time to bed when I was going to give directions at a fire.\\" No 101. Omar's plan of life (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 22 March 1760 Caled, the son of the viceroy of Egypt, asks Omar, a wealthy lawyer, how he should plan his life. Omar says it is best not to make plans at all, and uses his own life as an example. He planned to spend ten years pursuing knowledge, then ten years travelling; then he would find a wife. He frittered away the time he had planned to spend learning, then tried to make up for it by intensively studying the law. As a result, he became highly valued at court, and could never get away from work to travel. Now he has had to retire because of ill health, and will die with none of his ambitions fulfilled. :\\"Such was my scheme, and such has been its consequence. With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I trifled away the years of improvement; with a restless desire of seeing different countries, I have always resided in the same city; with the highest expectation of connubial felicity, I have lived unmarried; and with unalterable resolutions of contemplative retirement, I am going to die within the walls of Bagdat.\\" No 102. Authors inattentive to themselves (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 29 March 1760 Johnson says most authors are too lazy to write their memoirs. He encourages more of them to do so, since the vicissitudes of literary fame make for an entertaining story. :\\"Success and miscarriage have the same effects in all conditions. The prosperous are feared, hated and flattered; and the unfortunate avoided, pitied and despised. No sooner is a book published than the writer may judge of the opinion of the world. If his acquaintance press round him in publick places, or salute him from the other side of the street; if invitations to dinner come thick upon him, and those with whom he dines keep him to supper; if the ladies turn to him when his coat is plain, and the footmen serve him with attention and alacrity; he may be sure that his work has been praised by some leader of literary fashions. Of declining reputation the symptoms are not less easily observed. If the author enters a coffee- house, he has a box to himself; if he calls at a bookseller's, the boy turns his back and, what is the most fatal of all prognosticks, authors will visit him in a morning, and talk to him hour after hour of the malevolence of criticks, the neglect of merit, the bad taste of the age and the candour of posterity.\\" This essay has the distinction of being among the first literary texts in English to have been published in direct Spanish translation. The translation, with some additions, appeared anonymously in 1764 in the Madrid weekly El novelero de los estrados, y tertulias, y Diario universal de las bagatelas. No 103. Horrour of the last (Johnson) Published: Saturday, 5 April 1760 Johnson wonders what his readers will think now that The Idler has come to an end. People approach the end of any endeavour with a certain dread. Since this last essay is being published during Holy Week, Johnson hopes it will cause readers to reflect that everything has an end ‚Äì including human life and the current age. :\\"Though the Idler and his readers have contracted no close friendship, they are, perhaps, both unwilling to part. There are few things not purely evil, of which we can say, without some emotion of uneasiness, 'this is the last'. Those who never could agree together, shed tears when mutual discontent has determined them to final separation; of a place which has been frequently visited, though without pleasure, the last look is taken with heaviness of heart; and the Idler, with all his chilness of tranquillity, is not wholly unaffected by the thought that his last essay is now before him.\\" ReferencesExternal links * The Adventurer and The Idler ‚Äì full text of both, including suppressed 'The vulture' chapter, from gutenberg.org. * The vulture from samueljohnson.com.

Roddey (born 1935) is a Pennsylvania businessman and politician best known as the former (and first) chief executive of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, from 2000 to 2004. He is a Republican and was the chair of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County from 2005 until 2016. Early life and career Roddey is originally from Asheville, North Carolina. He graduated from Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas with a degree in speech. He is a former United States Marine Corps captain, and moved to Pittsburgh in 1979.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=POQcAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=FmMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2034%2C5480957 Professional career Roddey served on the boards of Turner Communication Corp, Rollins Communication Corp, and others. He is the Emeritus Trustee of the University of Pittsburgh and has received three honorary doctorates from various institutions. He was appointed the Port Authority of Allegheny County, of which he became chairman, the Pittsburgh Water Authority, and the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, of which he also because chairman. In 2010, Politics Magazine named him one of the most influential Republicans in Pennsylvania. Roddey once was the head of the company Wexford Health Sources.Twedt, Steve. \\"Wexford Health works with inmates.\\" Pittsburgh Post- Gazette. Sunday April 12, 2009. Retrieved August 14, 2010. County Executive Prior to 2000, Allegheny County was governed by a group of three commissioners. In 1998, Roddey was appointed by the commissioners to manage a successful campaign (also initiated by the county commissioners) to replace that system (via a referendum) to a new system composed of a single Chief Executive and a 15-member County Council. Roddey argued along with the commissioners that this would more evenly distribute representation as the previous system tended to have commissioners predominantly from Pittsburgh, rather than other towns and communities in the county. (Pittsburgh is the county seat and by far the largest population center in the county, but still with only 26% of the county population in the city-proper.) In 1999, the first election was held for the new Chief Executive and County Council. Roddey won his race against Democrat (and \\"celebrity\\" coroner) Cyril Wecht, although Democrats won the majority of the seats on the new Council. This led to friction during his term in office. During his term, Roddey implemented a property reassessment begun by the former commissioners to reverse the county's financial situation. This increased the value of many homes in the county by 5%-- a legal maximum. This increase in tax revenue was not popular, but it did succeed in creating new operating revenue. Defeat and subsequent political activity In 2003, Roddey ran for reelection but lost to Dan Onorato. In interviews, he credits the re-assessments as leading to his decline in popularity. Following his time as Chief Executive, he became an appointed member of Pittsburgh's fiscal oversight board (Pittsburgh Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority), but resigned in February 2005. He was elected chair of the Allegheny County Republican Party in 2005. He drew plaudits for a relatively diminished showing for incumbent Democrat Luke Ravenstahl in the 2007 and 2009 Pittsburgh mayoral elections and Tom Corbett's victory in Allegheny County in the 2010 gubernatorial election, but was criticised for a 2012 speech in which he claimed to have jokingly attempted to yield a handicapped parking space to a man because he, \\"...saw that Obama sticker and thought [he was] mentally retarded.\\" He retired from his position as Party Chair in 2016, having presided over a period of financial stabilization and tripling membership growth for the organization.https://www.wtae.com/article/ex-county-executive-jim-roddey- resigns-as-allegheny-county-republican-chair/7477783 ReferencesExternal links * The two lives of Jim Roddey, Pittsburgh Business Times.

The generic chemical formula is C10H8‚àí(m+n)Cl(m+n). Commercial PCNs are mixtures of up to 75 components and byproducts.van de Plassche, E.; Schwegler, A. (2002). Polychlorinated naphthalenes, Preliminary Risk Profile.Ministry of VROM/DGM, Netherlands The material is an oil or a waxy solid, depending on the degree of chlorination. PCNs were once used in insulating coatings for electrical wires, as well as other applications, but their use has been largely phased out. Production PCNs started to be produced for high-volume uses around 1910 in both Europe and the United States.Chlorinated naphthalenes , Chemical Assessment Report S48, 2002, National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme In Europe the largest volume products were called Nibren waxes, made in Germany by Bayer. Other European PCN tradenames included Seekay (UK, from ICI), Clonacire (France), Cerifal (Italy) and Woskol (Poland). In the United States, the largest volume PCN products were called Halowax, from a New York company of the same name that was later owned by Union Carbide and then taken over by Koppers of Pittsburgh, PA, now Beazer East. Although trace amounts of PCNs may be released by natural processes such as wildfires, their industrial uses increased the apparent rates of accumulation in the environment by factors of 10,000 or more. Safety After about twenty years of commercial production, health hazards began to be reported in workers exposed to PCNs: chloracne, severe skin rashes and liver disease that led to deaths of workers.Chronic exposure increases risk of liver disease. See Chlorinated naphthalenes exposure, Worker Notification Program, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health A conference about the hazards was organized at Harvard School of Public Health in 1937, and several more publications dealing with PCN hazards appeared before 1940. PCNs containing three or more chlorines per molecule have typically been found more hazardous than those with fewer, but as the maximum of eight is approached, hazards appear to decrease.Chlorinated naphthalenes, International Programme on Chemical Safety CICAD, 2001, volume 34 There was a lag of about forty years between disclosure of PCN hazards and government regulation. In the U.S. exposure to PCNs was drastically reduced after 1976, following enactment of the Toxic Substances Control Act. Major equipment manufacturers banned PCNs in their products, and major PCN producers discontinued operations. By 1983 worldwide PCN production had almost halted except for small amounts used in testing and research. Until recent years duPont produced a synthetic rubber, Neoprene FB, made in Northern Ireland using pentachloronaphthalene.Neoprene FB , Material Safety Data Sheet, DuPont de Nemours & Co., 1985 Today PCNs are offered commercially by only a few companies, including Ukrgeochem of Simferopol, Ukraine. Increased cancer risks have been suspected but so far not shown. Current concerns about PCNs include their release as byproducts of waste incineration. Bioaccumulation In 2013, the 9th meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee, established under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants proposed di-,tri-,tetra-,penta-,hexa-, hepta- and octa-chlorinated napthalenes, for listing in Annexes A and C to that Convention.UNEP (2013). Risk management evaluation on chlorinated naphthalenes, Report of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee on the work of its ninth meeting, Rome, 14‚Äì18 October 2013 (Addendum) While some PCNs can be broken down by sunlight and, at slow rates, by certain microorganisms, many PCNs persist in the environment. After more than 80 years of use and total production of several hundred thousand tons, PCN residues are widespread.

A cryptosystem is plaintext-aware if it is difficult for any efficient algorithm to come up with a valid ciphertext without being aware of the corresponding plaintext. From a lay point of view, this is a strange property. Normally, a ciphertext is computed by encrypting a plaintext. If a ciphertext is created this way, its creator would be aware, in some sense, of the plaintext. However, many cryptosystems are not plaintext-aware. As an example, consider the RSA cryptosystem without padding. In the RSA cryptosystem, plaintexts and ciphertexts are both values modulo N (the modulus). Therefore, RSA is not plaintext aware: one way of generating a ciphertext without knowing the plaintext is to simply choose a random number modulo N. In fact, plaintext- awareness is a very strong property. Any cryptosystem that is semantically secure and is plaintext-aware is actually secure against a chosen-ciphertext attack, since any adversary that chooses ciphertexts would already know the plaintexts associated with them. History The concept of plaintext-aware encryption was developed by Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway in their paper on optimal asymmetric encryption,M. Bellare and P. Rogaway. Optimal Asymmetric Encryption -- How to encrypt with RSA. Extended abstract in Advances in Cryptology - Eurocrypt '94 Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 950, A. De Santis ed, Springer-Verlag, 1995. full version (pdf) as a method to prove that a cryptosystem is chosen-ciphertext secure. Further research Limited research on plaintext-aware encryption has been done since Bellare and Rogaway's paper. Although several papers have applied the plaintext-aware technique in proving encryption schemes are chosen-ciphertext secure, only three papers revisit the concept of plaintext-aware encryption itself, both focussed on the definition given by Bellare and Rogaway that inherently require random oracles. Plaintext-aware encryption is known to exist when a public-key infrastructure is assumed. J. Herzog, M. Liskov, and S. Micali. Plaintext Awareness via Key Registration. In Advances in Cryptology -- CRYPTO 2003 Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 2729, Springer- Verlag, 2003. (pdf) Also, it has been shown that weaker forms of plaintext- awareness exist under the knowledge of exponent assumption, a non-standard assumption about Diffie-Hellman triples. M. Bellare and A. Palacio. Towards Plaintext-Aware Public-Key Encryption without Random Oracles.

Lamb 1996. Pitcher-Plants of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. is a Nepenthes species from the island of Borneo. The plant is widespread in north-western Borneo and can also be found in parts of Kalimantan. Nepenthes veitchii usually grows as an epiphyte, though the form from Bario seems to be strictly terrestrial and has not been observed to climb trees. Frederick William Burbidge described the growth habit of N. veitchii in The Gardeners' Chronicle as follows:Burbidge, F.W. 1882. Notes on the new Nepenthes. The Gardeners' Chronicle, new series, 17(420): 56. > Now as to N. Veitchii. This is a true epiphyte.

Its > distichous habit is unique, I fancy, and then some of the leaves actually > clasp around the tree just as a man would fold his arms around it in similar > circumstances. No other species of Nepenthes, so far as I know, has this > habit. Odoardo Beccari found N. veitchii on the top of Mount Santubong in 1865. He wrote the following account of his discovery:Beccari, O. 1904. Wanderings in the Great Forests of Borneo. Constable, London. > This is one of the finest and rarest of all pitcher-plants. ... Some of the > specimens I got measured quite ten inches in length.

Sir Joseph Hooker compares the mouth > of the pitchers of N. veitchii to the gills of a fish, to which, indeed, > with their narrow lamellae converging to the centre, they bear considerable > resemblance.

Maynooth Castle is a ruined 12th century castle in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland which stands at the entrance to the South Campus of Maynooth University. Constructed in the early 13th century, it became the primary residence of the Kildare Fitzmaurice and Fitzgerald family. History The area covered by modern Kildare was granted by Strongbow to Maurice Fitzgerald, Lord of Llanstephan in 1176. The original keep was constructed about 1203.\\"Maynooth Castle\\", Heritage Ireland The castle was built by Gerald Fitzmaurice (1st Lord of Offaly), 2nd eldest son of Maurice Fitzgerald, Lord Llanstephan at the junction of two streams in the late 12th century and became the home of the Fitzmaurice and Fitzgerald family. From then on it was expanded by Sir John Fitzgerald in the 15th century. Gerald Fitzmaurice's descendants became the Earls of Kildare and Earls of Leinster. Lords Deputy of Ireland. The Fitzgerald occupation of the castle ended with the 1534 rebellion of Silken Thomas, the son of the ninth Earl of Kildare. An English force led by William Skeffington bombarded the massive castle in March 1535, the heavy modern siege guns of the English army making a ruin of much of the Medieval structure. The castle fell after a ten-day siege and the garrison summarily executed before the castle gate. Silken Thomas was captured shortly afterwards and committed to the Tower of London with his five uncles. They were executed for treason at Tyburn on 3 February 1537. The Castle was restored in 1630-35 by Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, after his daughter had married George FitzGerald, 16th Earl of Kildare but much of this building was destroyed in the 1640s during the Eleven years war. Only the gatehouse (on which united arms of the Boyles and FitzGeralds can still be viewed) and the Solar Tower survive. The Fitzgeralds left Maynooth for good and made first Kilkea Castle and then Carton House their family seat. Restoration work on the castle was restarted by the Office of Public Works in February 2000 to develop it into a Heritage Site. It is now open to the public from June to October, 10.00 a.m. - 5.45 p.m.. Today the partly ruined building remains as a tourist attraction, with limited access possible.

He was a signatory of the Holston Treaty, and later became a Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Early leadership Named at birth Enola (also rendered Inali or Enoli), Black Fox was born about 1746.O'Dell, Larry. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture ; \\"Inola;\\" retrieved February 28, 2013 He was a brother-in-law of Chickamauga Cherokee leader, Dragging Canoe, and accompanied him on his migrations south to the Lower Towns during the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars. Black Fox was the \\"Beloved Man\\" (headman) of Ustanali, an important Native American settlement site which is located in what is today New Town in northwestern Georgia. As the fight with the frontier Americans drew to a close, he was one of the signers of the Treaty of Holston (July 2, 1791), an attempt at ending hostilities in the Holston River region. Principal chief In 1801 Black Fox was named by the council of chiefs of the Lower and Upper Towns to succeed Little Turkey as Principal Chief of the original Cherokee Nation.Brown, John P. \\"Eastern Cherokee Chiefs.\\" In Chronicles of Oklahoma Vol. 16, No. 1. March 1938. Retrieved February 28, 2013. The majority of Cherokee at that time lived in the Lower Towns. They were more isolated from European-American contact and tended to be more conservative, maintaining traditional practices and language. During his term in office, Black Fox was the leading negotiator for the Cherokee people with the United States federal government. He is noted for relinquishing nearly of land in what is today Tennessee and Alabama (under the treaty of January 7, 1806), for which he was given a lifetime annuity of $100. A controversial leader, Black Fox was deposed for a period, only to later be reinstated as Principal Chief in a compromise between two regional factions of Cherokees. In 1807, Doublehead, who was then speaker of the National Council, signed a treaty without the authority of the council, ceding all Cherokee land west and north of the Tennessee River to the United States. This was land which for centuries had been used for foraging by the Cherokee. A separate arrangement reserved certain parcels of land for use by Doublehead and his relatives. Black Fox confirmed Doublehead's treaty, however, after Return J. Meigs, the United States Indian Agent, promised Black Fox he would receive $1,000 in cash and a regular annuity thereafter. Doublehead was killed shortly thereafter for what many Cherokee viewed as a traitorous act. Deposed In 1808, Black Fox and The Glass (Tagwadihi), another leading chief in the Lower Towns, were deposed by the \\"young chiefs.\\" These were men mostly from the Upper Towns, led by James Vann and Major Ridge. The driving force of this revolt was due largely to the peoples' resentment of the National Council's domination by older leaders of the Lower Towns, as well as disagreement over the many recent land cessions. Some of the leadership of the Upper Towns were multiracial in ancestry; in addition, their communities were more closely engaged by trade and other links with those of the American settlers, whose frontier had continuously encroached on Cherokee territory. The Upper Town chiefs acquiesced to these territorial changes and desired to work more closely with the Americans. Reinstated Black Fox and The Glass were eventually reinstated in a compromise agreement between these two competing factions. This put an end to the councils of the Lower Towns meeting alternately in Willstown (near Fort Payne, Alabama) and Turkeytown (near present day Centre, Alabama), which were presided over by The Glass. Black Fox continued in the role of chief until the 1810 bureaucratic split with the \\"Old Settlers\\" then living in the west, remaining chief only of the people of the Cherokee Nation‚ÄìEast thereafter. As the leading member of the National Council, and strongly influenced by the murder of Doublehead, Black Fox signed the law to end the Cherokee tradition of clan revenge in 1810. Upon his death the following year, he was succeeded by Principal Chief Pathkiller. Legacy *Black Fox's early hunting camp was located on Lost Creek, in White County, Tennessee. The first European-American settlers in the middle district of Tennessee called one of the principal trails in the county \\"Black Fox Trail\\". *They named a large group of springs at what is now Murfreesboro, Tennessee \\"Black Fox Springs\\". *The community of Black Fox in modern Bradley County, Tennessee and its elementary school are named for him.

Cascade effects are commonly visualised in tree structures, also called event trees. In aeronautics Cascade effects seen in the perspective of space travelling are theoretical possibilities that \\"space junk\\" or a satellite destroyed by a meteor will send debris throughout the orbits of most telecommunication satellites destroying them in the process and subsequently sending that debris into all possible orbits, destroying everything in orbit around the Earth, known as the Kessler syndrome. It is theorized that if this occurs, space flight beyond Earth will become very difficult if not impossible. In medicine In biology, according to Mold and Stein, the term cascade refers to \\"a process that, once started, proceeds stepwise to its full, seemingly inevitable, conclusion\\". The main cause of a cascade of injury in medicine is by misdiagnosis and medical error. These result in iatrogenic injury and from medical error flows a cascade of effects and results often including pain, disability, loss of job, poverty and homelessness which obviously cause mental health problems and may cause death. In medicine, a cascade effect may also refer to a chain of events initiated by an unnecessary test, an unexpected result, or patient or physician anxiety, which results in ill-advised tests or treatments that may cause harm to patients as the results are pursued. An example would be ordering a full body CT scan without a clear reason, finding an incidentaloma and undergoing a debilitating surgery to remove it, despite the fact that the condition was asymptomatic and possibly benign. In ecology There is also an ecological definition of cascade effects, in which the death of one key species in an ecosystem triggers the extinction of other species. In disaster risk reduction and emergency planning Cascading effects are the dynamics present in disasters, in which the impact of a physical event or the development of an initial technological or human failure generates a sequence of events in human subsystems that result in physical, social or economic disruption. Thus, an initial impact can trigger other phenomena that lead to consequences with significant magnitudes. Cascading effects are complex and multi-dimensional and evolve constantly over time. They are associated more with the magnitude of vulnerability than with that of hazards. Low-level hazards can generate broad chain effects if vulnerabilities are widespread in the system or not addressed properly in sub- systems. For these reasons, it is possible to isolate the elements of the chain and see them as individual (subsystem) disasters in their own right. In particular, cascading effects can interact with the secondary or intangible effects of disasters (Pescaroli and Alexander 2015). \\"In this definition, it is embraced the multidimensional and complex nature of cascades. The different possible failures that can generate chain effects are integrated, while progression and magnitude become important. As it provides a mechanism for spreading cascades in space and time, vulnerability is considered critical. This is related to the technique of isolating single effects and seeing them as possible autonomous cause-effect sequences, while in some events cascading effects coincide with secondary or intangible ones\\" (Pescaroli and Alexander 2015). The figure below illustrates the differences between: (a) linear paths of chain -effects, and (b) complex paths of cascades. In ‚Äúcascading disasters‚Äù, secondary emergencies escalate and become the centre of a crisis, challenging the coordination of emergency relief and long-term recovery. thumb The different levels of cascading effects that are present in complex events suggest a differentiation between cascading effects and Cascading disasters have been defined as: \\"Cascading disasters are extreme events, in which cascading effects increase in progression over time and generate unexpected secondary events of strong impact. These tend to be at least as serious as the original event, and to contribute significantly to the overall duration of the disaster's effects. These subsequent and unanticipated crises can be exacerbated by the failure of physical structures, and the social functions that depend on them, including critical facilities, or by the inadequacy of disaster mitigation strategies, such as evacuation procedures, land use planning and emergency management strategies. Cascading disasters tend to highlight unresolved vulnerabilities in human society. In cascading disasters one or more secondary events can be identified and distinguished from the original source of disaster\\" (Pescaroli and Alexander 2015).

It is responsible for an estimated 80 percent of the country's domestic power generation. Location The power station is located near the town of Palapye, in the Central District, approximately , by road, north-east of Gaborone, Botswana's capital city. The geographical coordinates of Morupule Thermal Power Station are 22¬∞31'12.0\\"S, 27¬∞02'12.0\\"E (Latitude:-22.520000; Latitude:27.036667). Overview=Morupule A Morupule A Power Station comprises four air-cooled 33 megawatts coal-fired units, with coal supplied from the adjacent Morupule Colliery, owned by Debswana. Total generation capacity is 132 megawatts. Construction on the existing station started in 1982 and was completed in 1989. In 2016, the government of Botswana sourced funds to renovate and restore Morupule A. The contract was won by Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction at a contract price of BWP:2.5 billion (US$204 million in 2016 money). The upgrade was expected to last until 2018. On completion of the upgrade Morupule A is expected to function at 80 percent plant availability for another 15 years (until 2033). Morupule B Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) was considering an expansion of the Morupule Power Station since 2006. BPC eventually decided on 600 megawatts, consisting of four 150 megawatts units. At the time this project was conceptualized, 80 percent of the electricity consumed in Botswana, was imported from the South African utility, Eskom. The World Bank and the African Development Bank both provided partial funding to the construction of Morupule B. In 2010 construction began, with the lead contractor being China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC). Completion was expected in 2012. However, by April 2013, Units I and II were out of service, undergoing repairs for cracks in their air ducts, that developed soon after installation. Unit III, the only functioning unit at the time, had also developed the same problem. Unit IV was still under construction. This led to severe power shortage, resulting in load shedding and rolling blackouts. In January 2014, the government of Botswana hired STEAG Energy Services of Germany to ‚Äúidentify problems created by CNEEC and rectify them‚Äù. After CNEEC was forced to leave, on 31 December 2013, STEAG took over maintenance and operation of Morupule B, effective 1 January 2014. Installation of all four units was completed in 2014. In June 2018, the government of Botswana terminated talks with state-owned China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), in attempts to divest from Morupule B. These negotiations had been ongoing since 2016. In 2018, the power station was producing at about 81 percent capacity (producing approximately 486 megawatts). Controversy The Morupule B Power Station has been beset with problems right from the start. A forensic investigation into the matter has found that Botswana Power Company staff members colluded with CNEEC to embezzle more than BWP:1 billion (approx. US$90.5 million in 2014), from the BWP:10 billion (approx. US$905 million) Morupule B power project. Ownership Morupule A and Morupule B are both owned 100 percent by the Botswana Power Corporation (BPC).

In the laboratory setting, Pfu is used to amplify DNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), where the enzyme serves the central function of copying a new strand of DNA during each extension step. It is a family B DNA polymerase. It has an RNase H-like 3'-5' exonuclease domain, typical of B-family polymerase such as DNA polymerase II.InterPro protein view: P61875 Proofreading ability of Pfu polymerase Pfu DNA polymerase has superior thermostability and proofreading properties compared to Taq DNA polymerase. Unlike Taq DNA polymerase, Pfu DNA polymerase possesses 3' to 5' exonuclease proofreading activity, meaning that as the DNA is assembled from the 5' end to 3' end, the exonuclease activity immediately removes nucleotides misincorporated at the 3' end of the growing DNA strand. Consequently, Pfu DNA polymerase-generated PCR fragments will have fewer errors than Taq-generated PCR inserts. Commercially available Pfu typically results in an error rate of 1 in 1.3 million base pairs and can yield 2.6% mutated products when amplifying 1 kb fragments using PCR. However, Pfu is slower and typically requires 1-2 minutes per cycle to amplify 1kb of DNA at 72 ¬∞C. Using Pfu DNA polymerase in PCR reactions also results in blunt-ended PCR products. Pfu DNA polymerase is hence superior to Taq DNA polymerase for techniques that require high-fidelity DNA synthesis, but can also be used in conjunction with Taq polymerase to obtain the fidelity of Pfu with the speed of Taq polymerase activity. History Scientists led by Eric Mathur at the biotech company Stratagene, based in La Jolla, California, discovered Pfu DNA polymerase which exhibits significantly higher fidelity of replication than Taq DNA polymerase in 1991. They received patents for exonuclease-deficient Pfu and the full Pfu in 1996., Other polymerases from Pyrococcus strains such as \\"Deep Vent\\" () from strain GB-D and Pwo DNA polymerase has also seen use.

They were located in present-day southeastern Tennessee. He became chief following the death of Old Tassel, and the abandonment of the traditional capital at Chota after raids by European Americans.  Early life and education  Uskwa'li-gu'ta was born into his mother's family and clan, as the Cherokee had a matrilineal system. Accordingly, his maternal uncle would have taught him men's ways and guided him into the men's societies. He was a descendant of Moytoy III.  Marriage and family  His wife Betsy was the sister of the chief Attakullakulla.  Adult years  Representing his mother's clan, Hanging Maw was on the tribal council for some time. Although Hanging Maw claimed the title of First Beloved Man by right as the chief headman of the Overhill Towns, the rest of the nation had chosen Little Turkey when they moved the seat of the council south to Ustanali on the Conasauga River following the murder of Old Tassel. Uskwa'li-gu'ta was a descendant of Moytoy of Citico. They both exerted power for some time. Hanging Maw took part in the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars (1776‚Äì1794). In February 1786 in Middle Tennessee, approximately 20 miles southeast of Lafayette, he led a party of 60 men in a skirmish with a surveying party, made up of John and Ephraim Peyton, Squire Grant, and two other white men. Outnumbered, the white men escaped the area, but lost their horses, game, and surveying instruments to the band of Cherokee. The stream at the site of the skirmish became known as \\"Defeated Creek.\\" In 1793, a diplomatic party from the Lower Cherokee (as the Cherokee still at war with the United States were by then called) was attacked by colonial militia while traveling to Knoxville, Tennessee, then capital of the Southwest Territory. The militia pursued the Cherokee to Chota on the Little Tennessee River. The town was much reduced since the capital had been moved to Unstanali, near present-day Calhoun, Georgia. When the militia could not capture the diplomatic party, they attacked the people of the town, wounding Hanging Maw and killing his wife Betsy. The Cherokee retaliated with an invasion of the Holston River settlements. They gathered the largest force of Indians to that point, more than 1,000 warriors from both the Cherokee and the Upper Muskogee, led by John Watts, the chief of the Lower Cherokee. Some warriors killed a European-American family at a small fortified settlement known as Cavett's Station, although Watts had promised them safe passage. The Cherokee became divided over this incident.

It appears as \\"Oconastota\\" (with two 'a's) on his grave marker at the site of Chota. Chota had been the chief town of Overhill Cherokee for a time. Background Oconostota may have been a son of Moytoy of Tellico, and was born around 1704, one of eleven children. The identity of Oconostota's first wife is a mystery, although she was of the Paint Clan. Their daughter, Nionne Ollie, married his cousin Attakullakulla, his predecessor as First Beloved Man. Some sources claim Nionne Ollie was a Natchez refugee who was adopted as the daughter of Oconostota's wife (as the Cherokee were a matrilineal society, inheritance and descent went through the mother's clan.)Klink, Karl, and James Talman, ed. 'The Journal of Major John Norton (Toronto: Champlain Society, 1970), p.42 Some Natchez or Natchers lived in the Upper South prior to relocating farther south. Oconostota first appears in historical records in 1736. He was a prominent warrior among the Cherokee, and was called \\"The Great Warrior of Chota.\\" He may have been influenced by the German utopian Christian Priber, who lived with the Cherokee from about 1735 to 1739.Woodward, Grace Steele, \\"The Cherokees\\" (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1963), p. 68 He eventually transferred his allegiance from the French to the British, and in 1753 led a pro-British Cherokee force against the Choctaw. Over the next 12 years the Cherokee fought both with and against the British, but as more and more American settlers encroached on Cherokee land, the Cherokee threw their support behind the British.Kelly, James C. , \\"Oconostota,\\" (Journal of Cherokee Studies, Vol. III No. 4, Fall 1978) pp. 221-238 Oconostata led a February 1760 attack on Fort Prince George where 29 Cherokee chiefs seeking peace had been imprisoned and then executed. He also defeated Col. Archibald Montgomery in Macon County in June 1760 and later captured Fort Loudoun. Oconostota became the First Beloved Man of the Cherokee following the death of his cousin Attakullakulla, sometime around 1775-1777\\\\. His tenure was fraught with warfare and struggle, which culminated in 1780 in the destruction of Chota and Tanasi by American revolutionary forces during the rebellion against the British and their allies. Many histories state that Oconostota went to England in either 1730 or 1762, but he was not a member of either delegation. Oconostota was believed to have died in either 1782 or 1783. He was buried with his hands on his chest holding a broadsword pointing down his body. Memorial Oconostota's grave at the Chota memorial, in Monroe County, Tennessee. During the archaeological digs at the site of Chota prior to the Tellico Reservoir impoundment, the remains of Oconostota were found. They were identified by a pair of reading glasses which he owned which were buried with him. Oconostota's remains were re-interred at Chota in the portion raised by TVA (which includes the site of the council house). A gravestone now marks the site. It has become a tradition to place a pebble on his gravestone to symbolize the permanence of his memory and legacy since a stone can never die.

Although he usually favored the British he was a consummate diplomat, always hoping for a peaceful resolution to problems but looking for the best interests of the Cherokees.Spencer C. Tucker, James R. Arnold, and Roberta Wiener The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars p. 41 Names Early on in his life, he was first known as Onkanacleah.Henry Thompson Malone Cherokees of the Old South p.4 According to the anthropologist James Mooney, Attakullakulla's Cherokee name could be translated \\"leaning wood\\", from ada meaning \\"wood\\", and gulkalu, a verb that implies something long, leaning against some other object. His name \\"Little Carpenter\\" derived from the English meaning of his Cherokee name along with a reference to his physical stature. As naturalist William Bartram described him, he was \\"a man of remarkable small stature, slender, and delicate frame.\\"Bartram, Travels, p. 485. \\"His ears were cut and banded with silver, hanging nearly down to his shoulders.\\" He was mild-mannered, brilliant, and witty.Walker, Narrative of a Kentucky Adventure, pp. 150‚Äì51. Felix Walker accurately characterized Attakullakulla in his speculation on the origin of the name Little Carpenter: just ‚Äúas a white carpenter could make every notch and joint fit in wood, so he could bring all his views to fill and fit their places in the political machinery of his nation‚Äù.Izumi Ishii Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He also excelled at building houses which could be another reason for him getting his title.Kimber, Isaac London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer, 1747-1783; London Vol. 35, (Feb 1766): p. 87 Early life Attakullakulla is believed to have been born in the territory of the Overhill Cherokee, in what is now East Tennessee , sometime in the early 1700s.Gerald Schroedl, \\"Attakullakulla,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Retrieved: 17 December 2013. His son, Turtle-at-Home, said that he was born to a sub-tribe of the Algonquian-speaking Nipissing to the north near Lake Superior. He was captured as an infant during a raid in which his parents were killed, and brought back to Tennessee to be adopted by a Cherokee family, where he was raised as Cherokee.Klink and Talman, The Journal of Major John Norton, p. 42 He married Nionne Ollie, a Natchez captive adopted as the daughter of his cousin, Oconostota. The marriage was permissible because they were of different clans; he was Wolf Clan and she was Paint Clan. He was a member of the Cherokee delegation that traveled to England in 1730.Tortora, Carolina in Crisis, pp. 17-22. In 1736, he rejected the advances of the French, who had sent emissaries to the Overhill Cherokee. Three or four years later, he was captured by the Ottawa, allies of the French, who held him captive in Quebec until 1748. Upon his return, he became one of the Cherokees' leading diplomats and an adviser to the Beloved Man of Chota. Cherokee warrior In the 1750s, Attakullakulla worked to provide a steady supply of trade goods for his people. When the French and Indian War began, Cherokees journeyed to the Pennsylvania frontier to serve in British military campaigns against French and Indian strongholds. Cherokees were murdered on their way home by Virginia frontiersmen. Attakullakulla journeyed to Pennsylvania, to Williamsburg, and then to Charles Town, securing the promise of trade goods as compensation. But this was not enough to satisfy young Cherokee who wished to honor their cultural obligation of \\"blood revenge\\" and sought social status. Throughout 1758 and 1759, Cherokee warriors launched retributive raids on the southern colonial frontier. Hoping that matters might be forgiven, Attakullakulla even led a Cherokee war party against French Fort Massiac, and tried to negotiate peace with the British.Tortora, Carolina in Crisis, pp. 57‚Äì58, 60, 63‚Äì64, 68. These efforts proved unsuccessful. In late 1759, Cherokees went to Charleston to try to negotiate with South Carolina authorities for peace. The colonial governor, William Henry Lyttetton, seized the delegates as hostages until the Cherokee responsible for killing white settlers were surrendered. Having raised an expeditionary force of 1700 men, Lyttleton set out for Fort Prince George, with the hostages in tow, and arrived on December 9, 1759. Attakullakulla was forced to sign a treaty agreeing that the Cherokees would deliver up \\"murderers\\" in exchange for nearly two dozen hostages confined at Fort Prince George.Tortora, Carolina in Crisis, pp. 77‚Äì80. Attakullakulla returned to Fort Prince George in early 1760 to negotiate for the release of the hostages, but to no avail. As peaceful negotiations failed, Oconostota subsequently lured a Lt. Richard Coytmore out of the fort by waving a bridle over his head. He then incited Cherokee warriors hiding in the woods to shoot and kill Coytmore. The garrison in the fort retaliated with the execution of all the remaining Cherokee hostages. Cherokee Indians launched an offensive against settlements on the southern frontier. Many Cherokees blamed Attakullakulla for the death of the hostages. While he worked to try to bring about peace, later in 1760, British and South Carolina troops invaded the Cherokee Lower Towns and Middle Towns. They were forced to retreat and Fort Loudoun fell to the Cherokees. Attakullakulla again attempted to negotiate a peace, but this did not come until after a punitive British and South Carolina military expedition against the Middle and Lower Towns in 1761. Attakullakulla signed peace terms in Charles Town on December 18, 1761, but was robbed and harassed by angry frontiersmen on his journey home. Throughout the 1760s, he would work in vain to stall white settlement and was a frequent guest in Charles Town and Williamsburg.Oliphant, Peace and War on the Anglo-Cherokee Frontier, pp. 72‚Äì78Tortora, Carolina in Crisis, pp. 166‚Äì67. In the early 1740s the French-allied Ottawa warriors captured Attakullakulla and took him to Canada. He returned to the Cherokee country precisely when the imperial rivalry between the British and the French intensified.Izumi Ishii Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, When he returned he became the top lieutenant in his maternal uncle's Connecorte, Old Hop the head chief of the Chota.Spencer C.

Although he usually favored the British he was a skilled diplomat, always looking for a peaceful resolution to problems but looking for in best interests of the CherokeesSpencer C. Tucker, James R. Arnold, and Roberta Wiener The Encyclopedia of North When Connecorte died, it left Attakullakulla, the diplomat, and Oconostota, the war leader, with shared power and they led the Cherokees for a generation.James c. kelly American nation biography On June 2, 1760, he left the fort and was expelled from the Cherokee Council. He moved into the woods to live, finding it impolitic to be among either the ones who lost or the victors of the 1760 Cherokee War. In June 1761 a punitive British expedition dispatched by General Jeffery Amherst and commanded by Colonel James Grant ravaged the Cherokee towns in the Carolinas. Having failed to secure French support, the Cherokees recalled Attakullakulla to the council to negotiate peace with the British. Attakulla also influenced the selection of John Stuart as superintendent of Southern Indian affairs.James c. kelly American nation biography In 1772 Attakullakulla leased lands to the Watauga Association, a government formed by settlers, in what is now the upper eastern corner of Tennessee. In 1775 he favored the so-called Transylvania Purchase which North Carolina colonel Richard Henderson bought twenty million acres in Kentucky and Middle Tennessee.James c. kelly American nation biography In the Treaty of Broad River (1756), he agreed to a Cherokee land succession in exchange for the English promise to build forts in Cherokee territory to protect their women and children while the men were away at war. He honored treaty promises to the English but was opposed by fellow Cherokees for doing so. However, he played the colonies of South Carolina and Virginia against each other to secure fair trading practices for his people.Paul Finkelman & Tim Alan Garrison Encyclopedia of United States Indian Policy and Law p. 2 In the Treaty of Peace and Friendship concluded by his Excellency William-Henry Lyttjelton with Attakullakulla, it stated that there would ‚Äúbe firm peace and friendship between all His Majesty's subjects of this province and the nation of Indians called the Cherokees, and then said Cherokees shall preserve peace with all his majesty's subjects whatsoever‚Äù.Kimber, Isaac (ed.); Kimber, Edward (ed.).London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer, 1747-1783; London Vol. 29, (Mar 1760): 144‚Äì145. Family and death Although little is known of his parentage, his family did produce other leaders. Connecotre (Old Hop), the headman of the Cherokee during the 1750s, was his maternal uncle. Attakullakulla's son Dragging Canoe led a resistance to the United States in the 1780s. His niece, Nancy Ward, was a ‚Äòbeloved woman‚Äô, who had the power to free war captives.Izumi Ishii Oxford Dictionary of National Biography During the Revolutionary War, Attakullakulla was one of a party of elder Cherokee leaders who ceded lands to Virginia, contrary to the wishes of younger warriors. Attakullakulla's son, Dragging Canoe, the Chickamauga Cherokee leader during the Cherokee-American wars, split with his father during this time.Kelly, \\"Attakullakulla\\", pp. 25‚Äì27.Calloway, The American Revolution in Indian Country, pp. 182‚Äì212. After the Cherokees massacred Fort Loudon, Attakullkulla realized that Capt. Stuart, an agent of Indian Affairs under the colonial government, had escaped death. Attakullakulla had purchased Stuart from the Indian who had taken him. Attakullakulla gave his rifle, clothes and all he could command to purchase Stuart. After so doing, this by Cherokee custom made Stuart his eldest brother. The lifelong friendship proved to be profitable to the English.American Indian Wars p. 41 The life of Capt. Stewart being again menaced, for refusing to aid in the mediated reduction of Fort George, Attakullkulla resolved to rescue his friend or perish in the attempt. He accordingly signified to his countrymen that he intended to go hunting and take his prisoner with him to eat venison. The distance to the frontier settlements was great. The expedition was necessary to prevent being overtaken by those in pursuit of the Cherokee.

This article includes entities that are engaged in higher education accreditation or have been identified as being accreditors, but which lack appropriate recognition or authorization. Prerequisites and rules for higher education accreditation vary from country to country. In most countries, the function of quality assurance for higher education institutions is conducted by a government ministry of education. However in the United States, educational accreditation is performed primarily by private nonprofit membership associations,Diploma mills provide phony credentials, By Helena Andrews, The Capital Times/Medill News Service, February 14, 2005 the legitimacy of which is validated through recognition by the United States Department of Education (USDE), the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), or both. USDE and CHEA recognize many of the independent accrediting organizations, but not all. Accreditors seek USDE or CHEA recognition for different reasons; for example, USDE recognition is required for accreditors whose institutions or programs seek eligibility for federal student aid funds. CHEA recognition confers an academic legitimacy on accrediting organizations, helping to solidify the place of these organizations and their institutions and programs in the national higher education community. Often, a school relying on accreditation from an unrecognized accrediting body will not be viewed as legitimate in the academic community.Important Questions about \\"Diploma Mills\\" and \\"Accreditation Mills\\" , Council for Higher Education Accreditation, Fact Sheet 6, May 2003. Retrieved October 17, 2010. Institutional accreditation is usually required by US institutions to receive federal government funds. Also, students who attend institutions of higher education that are accredited through organizations not recognized by the USDE or CHEA do not qualify for US government financial aid.An Overview of U.S. Accreditation, by Judith S. Eaton, CHEA. Archived August 4, 2007. Similarly, employers or graduate programs cannot be confident that graduates of an unaccredited institution or program will be appropriately prepared. To assist education consumers, several national and international bodies publish lists of recognized accreditation bodies and accredited educational institutions, as well as lists of other accreditors that are known to lack the necessary legal authority or recognition, and higher education providers known to lack accreditation. The United States organization CHEA maintains an international directory of education ministries and other recognized higher education quality assurance bodies worldwide. The 2007 version of that directory lists 467 recognized bodies in 175 countries.CHEA International Directory introduction , accessed November 21, 2010 Many, but not all, of the entities in the list below are considered to be fraudulent accreditation mills that were set up to help diploma mills lure students and whose \\"accreditation\\" has no legal or academic value. Some diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating these accrediting bodies as well. These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, or previous learning, and may even require the submission of a purported dissertation or thesis, in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy. Some other listed entities are religious accreditation bodies, whose accreditation may have doctrinal significance but lacks recognized academic value. Also included are some organizations that do not offer educational accreditation but have been falsely identified as accrediting bodies by organizations that claim to have been accredited by them. A notable example of this last type is UNESCO, which does not have authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies. Nonetheless, because diploma mills have claimed false UNESCO accreditation, UNESCO itself has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation.Luca Lantero, Degree Mills: non-accredited and irregular higher education institutions , Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA), Italy. \\"On Unesco's website a warning has also been published regarding all institutions that claim to be recognized by them, but which are actually not.

The majority live in Trinidad but there are a handful in Tobago as well. A Mosque in Montrose, Chaguanas. Masjid al Tawbah in Lowlands, Tobago History of Islam in Trinidad and Tobago The first Muslims to arrive in the country arrived from Africa brought as slaves by the colonists. The second group arrived in 1816 as a small proportion of those of the Corps of Colonial Marines who were African-born and had been recruited in 1815 in Georgia during the War of 1812, mostly settled in Fifth and Sixth Companies within the Company Villages near Princes Town. They were followed by African Muslims among disbanded members of the West India Regiments settled between 1817 and 1825 in Manzanilla on the East Coast and in a group of villages south-east of Valencia, and further African Muslims were brought to Trinidad as a result of the Royal Navy's interception of slaving ships following the Slave Trade Acts. From the 1840s, Muslims came from South Asia as part of the Indian indenture system to work on sugar cane and cacao plantations. Muslims today are mostly of South Asian descent but there are converts from all races. In Trinidad there are Islamic primary and secondary schools. The first Muslim secondary school in the country, ASJA Boys' College, San Fernando, was established in 1960. A Mosque in Hermitage Village There are many mosques and Eid ul Fitr is a public holiday. There are several mosques belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and 5 mosques belonging to the Ahmadiyya Anjuman Isha'at Islam Lahore. On 27th July 1990 a local fringe group of Islamic extremists known as the Jamaat al Muslimeen attempted a coup d'√©tat (see Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt). Although the coup was unsuccessful and ended with the surrender of the insurgents on 1st August 1990, it involved the taking of many high-profile government and media hostages, several shootings (some fatal), and sparked widespread looting and arson mainly in the capital of Port-of-Spain. In total 24 people were killed under various circumstances related to this attempted coup, and many millions of dollars of damage to property was suffered. The country's international reputation was also tainted by this event. In 2005, an Islamic television channel IBN Channel 8 was born.

He was given the title of \\"Emperor of the Cherokee\\" by Sir Alexander Cumming, a Scots-Anglo trade envoy in what was then the Province of South Carolina, and is regularly referred to as \\"King\\" in official English reports, as this was a familiar term of rank to colonists. He was from Great Tellico, an historic Cherokee town in what is now Tennessee. In 1730 Cumming, a Scottish adventurer with ties to the colonial government of South Carolina, arranged for Moytoy to be crowned emperor over all of the Cherokee towns in a ceremony intended to appeal to Cumming's colonial sponsors. The Cherokee was crowned in the town of Nikwasi with a headdress referred to as the \\"Crown of Tannassy.\\" Cumming arranged to take Moytoy and a group of Cherokee to England to meet King George II. Moytoy declined to go, saying that his wife was ill. Attakullakulla (Little Carpenter) volunteered to go in his place. The Cherokee laid the \\"Crown\\" at King George's feet, along with four scalps. According to some authorities, Moytoy's wife was a woman named Go-sa-du-isga,. After the death of Moytoy, his son, Amouskositte, tried to succeed him as \\"Emperor\\". However, by 1753 Conocotocko (Old Hop) of Chota in the Overhill Towns had emerged as the dominant leader in the area. One of the seven sacred wampum belts still in the possession of the Western Cherokee has the large initials A.M. at one end. The other end has a large square feature that is often seen on wampum belts that are commemorating treaties. There is a very long white \\"path\\" connecting the two ends possibly referring to the great distance that separates the two parties. It is possible that this is the belt that is mentioned in and that commemorates the treaty between the British and Amatoya Moytoy (A.M.) in 1730 (Articles of Friendship and Commerce). The Cherokees who are in possession of the belt, however, give a very different interpretation of its meaning. References=Sources *Brown, John P. Old Frontiers.

Lee Theatre Plaza, built on the site of the Lee Theatre Lee Theatre () was a prominent theatre in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. Once one of the premier performing venues in Hong Kong, the Beaux-Arts theatre was demolished in the 1990s and replaced with an office building and a shopping centre. History In the 1920s, the Hysan Lee family acquired lands in the Causeway Bay area. At the time, most of the venues for Cantonese opera were located in Western District. In order to save his mother, an avid Cantonese opera fan, from having to make frequent trips there, Lee decided to build a theatre in Causeway Bay. The theatre, located on Percival Street near Leighton Road, was completed in 1925 with seating for 2000 patrons.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/34636 Upon its opening, Hong Kong Tramways began to run a special late night service from the theatre to Shek Tong Tsui. The Lee Theatre supposedly opened to business on 10 February 1927. The theatre was renovated in the 1970s.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/34636 From 1973 until the late 1980s, the theatre hosted the annual Miss Hong Kong pageant, organized by TVB (in which the Lee family held a stake). The theatre also hosted the Miss Universe pageant in 1976. Over the years, numerous artists gave performances at the theatre, including Roman Tam, Teresa Teng and Liza Wang. Along with hosting Cantonese opera and concerts, the theatre also showed films. The last one it screened before closing down was Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Redevelopment By the 1980s, property prices in Hong Kong skyrocketed, and the Lee family began to consider demolishing the theatre to develop the prime land it sat on. The land was sold to Hysan Development (the family's corporate arm) in March 1991, and the theatre closed four months later, on 19 August 1991. Roman Tam bade farewell to the theatre with a special concert, and RTHK's Television Division also prepared a special programme commemorating the theatre. The site was redeveloped into the Lee Theatre Plaza, a commercial building which was completed in 1995. There was also a movie cinema within the new building, but closed and replaced as a restaurant in 2005.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/34636 A replica facade of the original Lee Theatre can be found at the Hong Kong History Museum.

Its main features are its freshness, variety, simplicity, and the richness of its ingredients (which may be a result of the long geographical isolation the islands suffered), the mix of seafood and meat dishes, its cultural influences and the low knowledge of it by the rest of the world. Canarian cuisine is influenced by other cultures, specially the aboriginal inhabitants of the islands (Guanches) and Latin American cuisine (specially after the 20th-century Canarian migration to Latin America). Some African influences still prevail as well.  Sauces and appetizers  Papas arrugadas with mojo. Many small dishes are presented in the Canary Islands as appetizers, or snacks (tapas), which are known locally as enyesques. Mojo (pronounced mO-ho) is a sauce served with many dishes, which is made mainly of oil, garlic, vinegar, salt, red pepper, thyme, cumin, coriander and several other spices. The two main kinds of mojo are rojo (red, often served with meat) and verde (green, often served with fish), though both can be served with potatoes. Spicy red mojo is called mojo pic√≥n. This recipe is the base of the mojos of Latin America, especially Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela, due to heavy Canarian emigration, and have also influenced the cuisines of the non-Hispanic Caribbean islands. Papas arrugadas (literally, wrinkly potatoes, as a reference to the look of their cooked skin) are small unskinned potatoes which have been boiled in salt water and served with mojo. One very typical Canarian product is gofio, a flour created by grinding roasted sweetcorn, which used to be the staple food for the local population for centuries. Gofio is produced locally and is added to many foods. For instance, it can be mixed with warm milk to be drank in the morning, as well as made into a dough-like food called pella that can be eaten alongside meals. Gofio can also be stirred with fish broth and onions to create a dish called gofio escaldado or escald√≥n de gofio. Local varieties of cheese are popular and numerous, specially goat cheese. Both cheese from La Palma and Fuerteventura are protected by the Denominaci√≥n de Origen label. Other notable cheeses are the Flor de Gu√≠a cheese and the queso tierno (tender cheese). Hard cheese is made into a paste called Almogrote in La Gomera island. Grilled cheese with mojo is sometimes served as a starter.  First courses  Traditional Canarian meals usually start with soup, in order to prepare the stomach for the meal. Among the best-known soups are: * Potajes are chunky vegetable soups with potatoes, and they are one of the main ways Canarian people consume vegetables. Their ingredients can vary largely, depending on the island. One of the most popular is the potage de berros (watercress soup). They can be machine-blended into purees, more suitable for children. * Caldo de papas (potato soup) is a humble soup made mainly of potatoes and coriander. * Caldo de pescado (fish soup) usually features popular fish of the islands, like the mero (grouper), sama (common dentex) and cherne (wreckfish). * Rancho canario is a soup with chickpeas, lard, thick noodles, potatoes and meat.  Fish  Sancocho canario with dried and cooked wreckfish, potatoes, sweet potatoes, mojo and gofio Waters around the Canary Islands are rich with a great variety of autochthonous fish. These can be prepared in many ways, including oven-roasted (sometimes covered in a salt bed), fried, and marinated in various sauces. Some preparations include: * Sancocho canario, boiled fish with potatoes, sweet potatoes, gofio and mojo. In Tenerife, it is served in a pot. * Pescado seco (dry fish), which can include tollos (school shark strips served with sauce) and jareas (open and dried fish, similar to bacalhau, that are often eaten roasted).  Meats  The most widely consumed meats are pork, chicken, rabbit and goat. * Puchero canario is a meat-rich soup which is the Canarian equivalent to Spanish cocidos. Chicken, beef and pork meat are combined with chick peas, corn cobs, sweet potatoes, potatoes and other vegetables (such as carrot and cabbage). * Goat meat has been eaten in the islands since pre-Spanish times. * Ropa vieja (literally, 'old clothes') is a dish consisting of chicken and beef mixed with potatoes and garbanzos (chickpeas). Canarian ropa vieja is the father of Cuban ropa vieja through Canarian emigration. * Conejo en salmorejo is a traditional rabbit stewIslands Magazine. Vol. 14, No. 3. May-Jun 1994. p. 178. ISSN 0745-7847 marinated in coriander sauce (not to be confused with mainland Spain's salmorejo). * Pork is the main ingredient of dishes such as carne fiesta (literally, 'party meat') and costillas con pi√±a (ribs with corn cobs).  Sweets and desserts  Canarian desserts often use simple ingredients, such as cane sugar, honey, matalahuga or matalauva (anise), almonds and traditional miel de palma (especially on the island of La Palma). Among the desserts are bienmesabe (literally, a contraction of the Spanish phrase that means 'tastes good to me'), which is a paste of almonds, honey and sugar often served with ice cream or cream and cat's tongue cookies. Frangollo is a mix of corn flour, sugar, almonds and raisins, while truchas are pastries (filled with sweet potato paste or cabell d'angel, for instance) that are prepared at Christmastime. In El Hierro there is a cake named quesadilla which is made with cheese. Other specialities include rosquetes (ring-shaped fried pastries), quesillo (tender cheese cake), rapaduras (cane sugar candy), Pr√≠ncipe Alberto (chocolate cake from La Palma) and leche asada (milk cake). Gofio is also employed in some desserts such as huevos mole, pella de gofio (milk and gofio patty) and mousse de gofio (gofio cream). Tropical fruits, especially bananas, are widely grown and consumed in the islands, even if they are not native species.  Wines and liquors  The wine from the malvasia grape was a product of Canarian export since the 17th century, immediately after the decline of sugar plantations and until its commerce was blocked by the British Royal Navy in the late 18th century. Nowadays the islands produce ten protected geographical indications.

Club career Nicknamed Piru, Ga√≠nza's entire career was spent with Athletic Bilbao. Born in Basauri, Biscay, he made his official debut and scored in a Biscay Championship match on 15 January 1939 against SD Erandio Club, aged 16 years, 7 months and 18 days. This made him the club's second-youngest debutant (behind Domingo Acedo in 1914), a statistic which lasted until 2009 when Iker Muniain surpassed the appearance record by seven days and equalled the scoring one the following week. Ga√≠nza made his La Liga debut on 13 October 1940 in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against H√©rcules CF, then proceeded to play a total of 19 seasons in the competition with the same team, amassing totals of 380 games and 119 goals. During his spell with the Lions of San Mam√©s he won nine major titles, including two national championships and seven Copa del General√≠simo trophies, plus a Biscay Championship and a Copa Eva Duarte (supercup). In May 1958, he received a testimonial match against English side West Bromwich Albion; coincidentally, the only goalscorer was Ronnie Allen who later became head coach of Athletic and organised further benefit matches between the clubs. Ga√≠nza retired at the end of the 1958‚Äì59 campaign at the age of 37, having appeared in 494 official matches which was a club best at the time of his retirement. Such was his length of service that in addition to being one of its youngest goalscorers he was also the oldest, having found the net for the final time against Sevilla FC in March 1959, aged 36 years and 298 days; that record stood for 58 years, until Aritz Aduriz surpassed it in December 2017. Gainza also set several Spanish Cup records: he won seven editions, appeared in nine finals, played most for one club in the competition (99 games), and was the highest scorer in a single match, having claimed eight goals in a 12‚Äì1 victory over Celta de Vigo in the 1947 quarter- finals after a 0‚Äì1 loss in the first leg. Ga√≠nza coached Athletic during four seasons in the 1960s. He was sacked just six games into 1968‚Äì69, being replaced by former teammate Rafael Iriondo who led the side to a domestic cup conquest. International career Ga√≠nza won 33 caps for Spain, scoring ten goals. He made his debut on 11 March 1945 in a friendly against Portugal and, as with Athletic, was team captain in the 1950 FIFA World Cup as the country finished in fourth position.The high before Brazil‚Äôs biggest low; FIFA, 29 June 2013 Personal life Ga√≠nza's older brother, Miguel (1920‚Äì86), was also a footballer. A defender, he too played for Athletic Bilbao, and also for Barakaldo CF. It was reported that as a child Agust√≠n was not interested in football and had to be encouraged to play the game by Miguel, and even when approached by Athletic in his teens was reluctant to take it up as a career, with his brother persuading him to agree terms. Two bronze busts of Ga√≠nza were created by the sculptor Jos√© Manuel Alberdi in 1997. One was displayed outside his family home in Basauri (having been donated to the town by the local supporters' club), and the other was situated at the Athletic Bilbao training headquarters at Lezama. Death Ga√≠nza died on 6 January 1995 in his hometown, at the age of 72.

Plot Zinnia \\"Zinny\\" Taylor, an initially quiet, yet sometimes outrageous thirteen-year-old girl. She enjoys the care of her aunt and uncle, Jessie and Nate, as her parents are preoccupied with her siblings, and she enjoys spending time outdoors. Jessie and Nate live in a home that fits snug against the Taylor home, and Zinny prefers to spend her time with her aunt and uncle, while they mostly going on nature walks. They once had a daughter, Rose, around Zinny's age who died (of whooping cough). Aunt Jessie prefers not to talk about her daughter. Because Rose caught the cough from Zinny, she has always, in some way, blamed herself for Rose's death. Years later, Zinny accidentally rediscovers a large overgrown trail that is over two hundred years old. When her aunt unexpectedly dies, Zinny blames herself. Soon afterwards she begins to try to clear the trail. In her grief, the trail becomes an obsession, as she decides to clear and travel the entire length of it. Thinking clearing the trail is the only way to be forgiven by God, Zinny camps out on the trail to clear the trail before the end of the summer. At the same time Zinny learns to cope with her grief, her guilt, and a boy named Jake Boone, who she starts to have feelings for. Throughout the story she must attempt to get over the death of Rose and Aunt Jessie. She also tries to find out whether Jake returns her feelings or is just using her to get to her older sister, May. Through all this Zinny finally finds something to call her very own, the trail that she cleared. Throughout the story Creech uses flashbacks as a literary device, showing snippets of what Zinny's life was like before her aunt's death, and how her life changed after her dear aunt Jessie died.

Bonkers was a candy offering from Nabisco in the mid-1980s. It consisted of chewable rectangular-shaped candies with tangy filling. The candy came in a large rectangular package with several of them individually wrapped. Common flavors included grape, orange, strawberry, watermelon and chocolate. The product is perhaps most memorable for a series of television commercials in which one or more apparently uptight characters would take one bite of a Bonkers candy, and a giant fruit such as a bunch of grapes would fall from above and knock them into hysterical laughter. The tagline in the commercials was \\"Bonkers! Bonks you out!\\" Several of the commercials featured an older Southern woman who said in a deadpan voice that \\"Some folks think Bonkers is gum\\" after which the aforementioned giant fruit would fall on someone, inducing raucous laughter. The woman would then deadpan the line: \\"They know it's candy now.\\" The original commercial had an ending that featured another giant piece of fruit falling, causing the actor to frown & a dour voice-over saying 'Artificially Flavored'. This was redone to have the actor continue to laugh when the last piece of fruit landed & the voice sounded more pleasant when it noted the artificial flavoring. Most of Bonkers candy commercials tended to be very high in energy, often with excited overtones. After the commercials stopped running, the popularity of Bonkers waned until it became a rarity, available only in novelty candy stores. The manufacturer has discontinued the Bonkers line of candies. High competition in the candy and snack market combined with the increased focus on healthy alternatives may have also furthered the wane of Bonkers popularity . In February 2012, Leaf Brands, LLC (www.leafbrands.com) acquired the trademark and planned to reintroduce the classic brand back into the market by the end of 2015.http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/3/prweb9245771.htm In 2017, Leaf Brands announced a return of the original Bonkers and planned to reintroduce some of the eight flavors. In November 2016, Bonkers Fruit Candy's Facebook and Twitter accounts stated, \\"We made more samples of Bonkers Fruit Chews on the line last week and we think they look pretty good! Getting closer but no date yet..\\" (With two pictures below), there have been no more updates on Bonkers Fruit Candy. The original flavors include: * Peach * Apple (Red outside, green inside) * Lemon * Lime * Vanilla (Malagasy Vanilla outside, Vanilla cake inside) * Lemon-Lime (Lemon outside, Lime inside) * Vanilla-Peach (Malagasy Vanilla outside, Peach inside) * Peach-Apricot (Peach outside, Apricot inside) * Chocolate * Watermelon * Grape * Orange * Strawberry New Bonkers Candy company Joyco made and sold a candy called \\"Bonkers\\" with no relation and very little similarity to the original Nabisco variety.

With the addition of snow making in 2000, the season has been extended from late November to late March or early April. Mont Ripley is known for its challenging terrain and views of Houghton, Portage Lake and the Huron Mountains. It is also commonly used by racers. History Mont Ripley opened in 1934. In 1944 it was taken over by Michigan Technological University. In 2006, a new building was built to ease congestion in the main chalet. The new chalet has a gas fireplace and added seating, as well as more lockers. It is mainly used for special events such as races and parties. Mont Ripley also purchased eight more snow making guns to add to their capability to get all the runs open earlier in the season. Also in 2006, a second chair lift, dubbed the \\"Copper Hoist\\", was purchased and was built on the east side of the hill in 2007, making it easier for skiers and snowboarders to use those runs, raising the lift count to three (2 chair lifts and one t-bar).

Czibor played as a left-winger or striker and was notable for having a powerful shot, good pace and excellent ball control. During the 1950s he was part of the Magical Magyars, reaching the World Cup final with them in 1954. After the 1956 Hungarian Revolution he moved to Spain where he became a prominent member of the successful FC Barcelona team of the late 1950s.

As both men were about to leave the company following writing for The Commish in 1992, their former boss at Cannell, Peter Roth, invited them to work on a new show being developed at 20th Television, The X-Files. Morgan and Wong left The X-Files after season two to create their own show, Space: Above and Beyond, which was canceled after one season. They returned to The X-Files for season four, after which, Chris Carter hired the duo as showrunners for season two of Millennium.

The specific epithet spathulata is derived from the Latin word spathulatus, meaning \\"spatula shaped\\", and refers to the shape of the lamina. Botanical history One of the first collections of N. spathulata was made by Maurits Anne Lieftinck. The specimen Lieftinck 11 was collected in January 1935 on Mount Tanggamus near Lampung, Sumatra, at an altitude of 2000 m. Nepenthes spathulata was formally described by B. H. Danser later that same year, the first of two Nepenthes species described by the Dutch botanist following the publication of his 1928 monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\".Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. The next major taxonomic treatment of N. spathulata came only in 1986, when Rusjdi Tamin and Mitsuru Hotta treated the species in synonymy with N. singalana. The authors also lumped four other species under N. singalana: N. carunculata, N. gymnamphora, N. pectinata, and, by implication, N. densiflora. Many authors now consider N. carunculata to be a heterotypic synonym of N. bongso and N. pectinata is often equated with N. gymnamphora.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. On Mount Dempo, Mike Hopkins, Ricky Maulder and Bruce Salmon found what they believed to be a new species of Nepenthes. They published an account of their discovery in a 1990 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter. It reads: > We headed back up the line and went to G. Dempo as we wanted to climb at > least one unknown mountain. On this mountain, we found a new species related > to the highland Sumatran species by its leaf shape, stem shape and > inflorescence, but its upper pitchers are slightly similar to N. alata from > the Philippines. We gave the name N. 'dempoensis' after the mountain from > which it originated. The name N. dempoensis is a nomen nudum and the taxon is now considered conspecific with N. spathulata.Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes spathulata. Carnivorous Plant Database.Schlauer, J. 1995. Re: N.xiphioides + N.mikei. Carnivorous Plant Mailing List, September 26, 1995. In 1997, the genus Nepenthes was revised in its entirety by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek in \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\". The authors kept N. spathulata as a valid species and designated Lieftinck 11 as its lectotype.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106.

Nepenthes adrianii is generally considered to be a heterotypic synonym of N. spathulata.Rice, B.A. 2006. Do you want to tell me about a species I missed? The Carnivorous Plant FAQ. Description Nepenthes spathulata is a climbing plant. The stem may grow to a height of 5 m but is only up to 8 mm in diameter. Internodes are up to 15 cm long and cylindrical to angular or rhomboid in cross section. Leaves are sessile to sub-petiolate and coriaceous in texture. As the name suggests, the lamina is spathulate. It may be up to 30 cm long by 10 cm wide and is gradually attenuate towards the base. The apex of the lamina is rounded and shortly acuminate or emarginate. Three to five longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are generally indistinct. Tendrils are up to 20 cm long and sometimes have a sub- peltate insertion. Rosette and lower pitchers gradually or abruptly arise from the end of the tendril. The pitcher cup is ovoid in the lower third to two- thirds, becoming cylindrical and somewhat narrower above. N. spathulata probably produces the largest pitchers of the Sumatran Nepenthes species; they may be up to 30 cm high and 10 cm wide. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§25 mm wide) runs down the front of the pitcher. The glandular region covers the ovoid portion of the pitcher's inner surface; the waxy zone above is well developed. The mouth is round, very oblique throughout, and may be elongated into a short neck. The peristome is narrow at the front (‚â§5 mm wide), becoming much wider towards the rear (‚â§25 mm wide). It is flared at the sides and may be scalloped, although this feature is somewhat atypical of the species as a whole. The inner margin of the peristome is lined with short but distinct teeth. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 32% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate, lacks appendages, and is often slightly cordate. The spur, located near the base of the lid, is usually branched and may be up to 10 mm long. An upper pitcher of the Javan variant of N. spathulata informally called N. adrianii Upper pitchers are infrequently produced. They are narrowly ovoid in the lowermost quarter to third of the pitcher cup, becoming cylindrical above. They are much smaller than lower pitchers, only reaching 15 cm in height and 3 cm in width. The mouth is approximately round and is not elongated into a neck. It has an oblique insertion. The peristome is also much thinner (‚â§7 mm wide) and is often undulate at the margins. Two pronounced ribs are present in place of wings. In other aspects of morphology, upper pitchers are similar to their terrestrial counterparts. Nepenthes spathulata has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 5 cm long. The rachis may be up to 15 cm long, although it is shorter in female inflorescences. Pedicels are up to 10 mm long and have a filiform bracteole. Sepals are obovate to oblong in shape and up to 4 mm long. Inflorescences have a dense indumentum of short hairs. Developing pitchers are also densely covered with short hairs, but most of these are caducous. The stem, lamina and tendrils are virtually glabrous. The stem and lamina are green. Lower pitchers range in colour from light green with a dark purple peristome to yellowish-bronze with a bright red peristome. Ecology Nepenthes spathulata is native to the islands of Java and Sumatra. In Sumatra, it has been recorded from the Indonesian provinces of Jambi, South Sumatra, Bengkulu, and Lampung. Its natural range stretches from Mount Tanggamus in the south to Lake Kerinci in the north. It has a wide altitudinal distribution, having been recorded from elevations of 1100 to 2900 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012.

The natural habitat of the Javan variant of N. spathulata (plant in centre) Plants growing in mossy forest and lower montane forest usually have an epiphytic habit, while those from stunted upper montane forest on summit ridges generally occur terrestrially. Nepenthes spathulata is also known to grow terrestrially in high altitude peat swamp forest near Lake Kerinci, at an altitude of 1100 m. At this location, N. spathulata grows alongside N. ampullaria, N. gracilis, N. mirabilis, N. reinwardtiana, and N. tobaica. At least three natural hybrids of N. spathulata have been recorded there. The Nepenthes species and hybrids at this site exhibit high levels of introgression. The vegetation is dominated by species of the genera Rhododendron and Melastoma, as well as orchids and ferns. It is very stunted and dense, with few trees exceeding 3 m in height. It is somewhat reminiscent of the highland heath forests around Bareo in Sarawak, Borneo. The conservation status of Nepenthes spathulata is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Related species { align=right style=\\"margin: 0 0 0 1em\\"  An upper pitcher of N. ovata  A lower pitcher of N. singalana } N. naga. This taxon has a highly developed apical appendage and glandular crest, as well as an unusual frilled lid.Akhriadi, P., Hernawati, A. Primaldhi & M. Hambali 2009. Nepenthes naga, a new species of Nepenthaceae from Bukit Barisan of Sumatra . Reinwardtia 12(5): 339‚Äì342. The closest relative of N. spathulata appears to be N. singalana. It differs from this species in having a peristome that is contracted towards the front and very wide at the sides. In addition, it has less prominent peristome ribs and shorter teeth than N. singalana. N. spathulata has an ovate lid, compared to the orbicular operculum of N. singalana. Furthermore, N. spathulata has fewer glands on the lower surface of the lid and they are concentrated near the centre. In Jambi, the ranges of both species overlap, as the southernmost populations of N. singalana meet the northernmost populations of N. spathulata. Of particular note are plants growing on Mount Masurai, which appear intermediate in form between these two species and cannot be definitively assigned to either. These plants exhibit significant morphological variability, particularly in the development of the peristome, with some resembling N. singalana and others N. spathulata. Clarke writes that it \\"is possible that one taxon blends into the other in this region\\". Nepenthes spathulata is also allied to N. densiflora, a fact noted by B. H. Danser in his 1940 description of the latter species.Danser, B.H. 1940. A new Nepenthes from Sumatra. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 16: 268‚Äì271. However, Jebb and Cheek considered it more likely that N. bongso, rather than N. spathulata, is a close relative of N. densiflora. Nepenthes densiflora can be distinguished from N. spathulata on the basis of its upper pitchers, which are typically infundibular rather than cylindrical. However, a number of N. densiflora plants on Mount Kemiri are known to produce unusual cylindrical aerial pitchers. Nevertheless, these plants differ from N. spathulata in producing infundibular lower pitchers. The herbarium specimens Junghuhn 274 and Junghuhn 275, which were labelled as N. junghuhnii by John Muirhead Macfarlane, have pitchers that resemble those of N. spathulata (as well as N. bongso and N. singalana). However, the poorly known N. junghuhnii is easily distinguished from these species on the basis of its strongly petiolate leaf bases. The upper pitchers of N. spathulata, which are ovoid in the lower part and cylindrical above, distinguish it from other related species such as N. bongso and N. ovata. In 2001, Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is part of the resultant cladogram, showing \\"Clade 3\\", which comprises N. spathulata and three other related species.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Natural hybrids A lower pitcher of a putative N. spathulata hybrid from Mount Belirang, possibly with N. singalana Natural hybrids involving N. spathulata are relatively rare, as few other species grow sympatrically with it. Seven putative hybrids have been recorded to date, at least three of which are known from a unique highland peat swamp habitat around Lake Kerinci. Akhriadi, P. 2007. Kajian taksonomi hibrid alami Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) di Kerinci . Working paper, Andalas University, Padang. Abstract N. mirabilis √ó N. spathulata Nepenthes mirabilis √ó N. spathulata is one of the hybrids recorded from the Lake Kerinci peat swamp. The parent species are not known to be sympatric at any other location and so this hybrid is unlikely to occur elsewhere. The pitchers of N. mirabilis √ó N. spathulata are reddish-brown with dark speckles and a bright yellowish-red peristome. It differs from N. mirabilis in its wider peristome, which bears distinct teeth and more pronounced ribs. From N. spathulata, it differs in having chartaceous, sub- spathulate leaves, usually with fimbriate margins. N. reinwardtiana √ó N. spathulata Nepenthes reinwardtiana √ó N. spathulata is also known solely from the peat swamp near Lake Kerinci. Like N. mirabilis √ó N. spathulata, this hybrid is unlikely to occur anywhere else. The lower pitchers are infundibular in the lowermost part, becoming ovoid up to the hip, and cylindrical above. A pair of narrow wings, which may or may not be fringed, run down the front of the pitcher. Upper pitchers are more elongated and less ovoid, with no wings or fringe elements. The peristome is flattened and only slightly expanded. The lid is large and sub-orbicular in shape. The leaves are linear-lanceolate in shape, slightly decurrent towards the base, and have a sessile attachment. Other hybrids A third N. spathulata hybrid with N. tobaica has also been recorded from the Lake Kerinci peat swamp, and N. ampullaria √ó N. spathulata is known from the Kerinci region. In addition, N. inermis √ó N. spathulata is known from Jambi. Nepenthes gymnamphora √ó N. spathulata has also been recorded. A seventh putative hybrid with N. spathulata has been observed on Mount Belirang in Jambi. Its lineage is unclear due to the apparent absence of other possible parent species in the area.

In 1888, she became the first woman to run for mayor of New York City. Biography Born Cynthia Hicks Van Name in Buffalo, New York, she married Charles Egbert Leonard (1829‚Äì1896) in 1852.\\"Charles Egbert Leonard (1829‚Äì1896)\\", WikiTree, accessed June 6, 2019 They had eight children, the most famous of whom was entertainer Lillian Russell. While a young woman in Buffalo, Leonard became the first woman to stand behind a counter as a salesperson and later became a member of Buffalo's first Woman's Social and Literary Club. Four years after her marriage, in 1856, the couple moved from Detroit, Michigan to Clinton, Iowa, where Charles Leonard founded the Clinton Herald, that community's newspaper, still in existence today. She was on the executive committee of the Soldiers' Relief Association, which established the first soldiers' home in the state of Iowa, attending to the housing needs of Union soldiers recently released from the 18th Regimental Hospital, then quartered in Clinton. In 1863, Charles Leonard sold the Herald, and the couple moved to Chicago. There Cynthia organized a fair to benefit the Freedman's Aid Society, helped found the Chicago branch of Sorosis and was editor of its newsweekly for a time, and was a member of the Chicago Philosophical Society. In 1869, she led the spiritualist faction of the women's suffrage movement at the Music Hall, one of the first women's suffrage meetings ever held in Chicago. Susan B. Anthony was a frequent visitor in the Leonard home. Cynthia organized the Good Samaritan Society, and after the great Chicago fire, she established a homeless shelter for the \\"unfortunate\\" women of the city. She was instrumental in the decision to place matrons in Chicago prisons, and she authored two novels: Adventures of Lena Rouden, or the Rebel Spy and Fading Footprints, or the Last of the Iroquois. In 1880, working with the Ladies Lecture Bureau, she helped organize a number of benefits for the Irish Famine. She was afterward accused of mismanaging (keeping for herself) some of the funds raised at one of these events.The New York Times, January 27, 1880. After she separated from her husband, Cynthia took their two youngest daughters, Nellie and Suzanne, to New York City to launch the girls' musical careers and to broaden her own political horizons. There she organized the Science of Life Club and in 1880 managed a benefit for starving women and children in Ireland. In 1888, she became the first woman to run for mayor of New York City. She died in New Jersey in 1908. In a May 3, 1914 interview with Djuna Barnes, Lillian Russell gave this testament to her mother: > To be a great woman, a great person, one must have suffered, even... > suffered in great crises.

The Port Boca Grande Lighthouse is on the southern tip of Gasparilla Island (located in Gasparilla Island State Park), and marked the Boca Grande Pass entrance to Charlotte Harbor. Port Boca Grande Lighthouse Port Boca Grande Lighthouse was first lit on December 31, 1890. It is a two-story frame dwelling raised on iron screw-piles, with the lantern placed in a cupola at the peak of the roof. The keeper lived in the lighthouse. A similar house (without a lantern) built next to it was the assistant keeper's dwelling. The Port Boca Grande Lighthouse originally served ships transporting cattle from ports on Charlotte Harbor to Cuba. Phosphate ore from the Peace River area became an important cargo in the 1890s, and the construction of the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway to Port Boca Grande in 1909 resulted in increased traffic. Ship traffic to Port Boca Grande peaked at more than 30 ships a day during World War II, when Port Boca Grande served as a safe harbor for shipping in the Gulf. The Gasparilla Island Light was deactivated in 1966, and abandoned by the Coast Guard in 1969. The buildings quickly deteriorated, and by 1970 beach erosion had exposed the screw-piles supporting the building, with waves breaking under the building at high tide. Two rock groins were built to protect the lighthouse, and sand was pumped in to build up the beach. Lee County took title of the lighthouse in 1972. On February 28, 1980, the lighthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Restoration work began in 1985, and in 1986 the light was recommissioned. In 1988 the building and surrounding property were turned over to the State of Florida and became Gasparilla Island State Park. In 1999 the Historic Port Boca Grande Lighthouse and Museum opened to the public and is operated by the Barrier Island Parks Society The light is considered an Aid to Navigation and the lamp room is maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard Station St. Petersburg Aids to Navigation Team. Gasparilla Island Light The Gasparilla Island Light was originally constructed in 1885 to serve as the Delaware Breakwater Range Rear Light. Due to erosion, the light was decommissioned in 1918. The tower was disassembled in 1921, and reassembled on Gasparilla Island in 1927. However, the light was not lit until 1932, when it began service as the rear entrance range light for Port Boca Grande, with the front entrance range light approximately one mile off shore in the Gulf of Mexico. When the two lights, which flashed at different rates, lined up, the ships' navigators knew it was time to turn to enter Boca Grande Pass. Though the front range has been removed, the Boca Grande Rear Range Light remains in service today as the Gasparilla Island Light. It is an Aid to Navigation and is maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard Station St. Petersburg Aids to Navigation Team. The Gasparilla Island Light was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014, and the lighthouse was transferred to the Barrier Islands Parks Society in 2016. The society commissioned a restoration of the lighthouse, including the installation of a replica of its original fresnel lens. The light was switched on again in 2018.

The targets of these attacks were sanctuaries and Base Areas of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN ‚Äî commonly referred to during the Vietnam War as the North Vietnamese Army [NVA]) and forces of the Viet Cong (VC), which utilized them for resupply, training, and resting between campaigns across the border in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). The impact of the bombing campaign on the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the PAVN, and Cambodian civilians in the bombed areas is disputed by historians. An official United States Air Force record of U.S. bombing activity over Indochina from 1964 to 1973 was declassified by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 2000. The report gives details of the extent of the bombing of Cambodia, as well as of Laos and Vietnam. According to the data, the Air Force began bombing the rural regions of Cambodia along its South Vietnam border in 1965 under the Johnson administration; this was four years earlier than previously believed. The Menu bombings were an escalation of what had previously been tactical air attacks. Newly inaugurated President Richard Nixon authorized for the first time use of long-range Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers to carpet bomb Cambodia. Operation Freedom Deal immediately followed Operation Menu. Under Freedom Deal, B-52 bombing was expanded to a much larger area of Cambodia and continued until August 1973. Background From the onset of hostilities in South Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos in the early 1960s, Cambodia's Prince Norodom Sihanouk had maintained a delicate domestic and foreign policy balancing act. Convinced of the inevitable victory of the communists in Southeast Asia and concerned for the future existence of his government, Sihanouk swung toward the left in the mid-1960s.Arnold Isaacs, Gordon Hardy, MacAlister Brown, et al., Pawns of War. Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1987, p. 83. In 1966, Sihanouk made an agreement with Zhou En-lai of the People's Republic of China that would allow PAVN and VC forces to establish Base Areas in Cambodia and to use the port of Sihanoukville for the delivery of military material.Isaacs, Hardy, & Brown, p. 85. The US, heavily involved in South Vietnam, was not eager to openly violate the asserted neutrality of Cambodia, which had been guaranteed by the Geneva Accord of 1954. Beginning in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized covert reconnaissance operations by the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG).Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, Command History 1967, Annex F, Saigon, 1968, p. 4. The mission of the highly classified unit was to obtain intelligence on the PAVN/VC base areas (Project Vesuvius) that would be presented to Sihanouk in hopes of changing his position.Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, Command History 1968 Annex F, Saigon, 1969, p. 27. Meeting in Beijing: Mao Zedong (l), Prince Sihanouk (c), and Liu Shaoqi (r) By late 1968, Sihanouk, under pressure from the political right at home and from the US, agreed to more normalized relations with the Americans.Isaacs, Hardy, & Brown, p. 88 In July 1968, he had agreed to reopen diplomatic relations and, in August, formed a Government of National Salvation under the pro-US General Lon Nol.Isaacs, Hardy, and Brown, p. 90. Newly inaugurated President Richard M. Nixon, seeking any means by which to withdraw from Southeast Asia and obtain \\"peace with honor\\", saw an opening with which to give time for the US withdrawal, and time to implement the new policy of Vietnamization. Nixon had promised during the election of 1968 if elected to continue the peace talks which started in Paris in May 1968, thereby ruling out seeking a military solution to the war and to continue Johnson's approach of seeking a diplomatic solution.Karnow Vietnam p.588-589 Nixon's main opponent, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, was also committed to a diplomatic solution, and Nixon had presented himself during the election as the man best capable of reaching a favorable peace deal in Paris.Karnow Vietnam p.581-582 Only George Wallace of the American Independent Party had committed himself during the election to fight on in Vietnam until a military victory, winning 13% of the vote. The diplomatic settlement Nixon wanted was to be on American terms by preserving South Vietnam.Karnow Vietnam p.588-589 A key aspect of Nixon's approach was what he himself called the \\"madman theory\\" under which he was to act like he was a dangerous leader capable of any act up to and including nuclear war to intimidate North Vietnam into a diplomatic settlement on American terms.Karnow Vietnam p.582-583 Nixon believed that the Chinese had signed the armistice of Panmunjom in July 1953 because of the threats made by Eisenhower in the spring of 1953 to use nuclear weapons in Korea, and that strategic bombing or the mere threat of strategic bombing would force the North Vietnamese to sign an armistice similar to the armistice of Panmunjom.Karnow Vietnam p.582 Nixon conceded that his election promises ruled out a \\"military victory\\", but as he often said in private he did not want to be \\"the first president of the United States to lose a war\\".Karnow Vietnam p.582 Before the diplomatic amenities with Sihanouk were even concluded, Nixon had decided to deal with the situation of PAVN/VC troops and supply bases in Cambodia. He had already considered a naval blockade of the Cambodian coast, but was talked out of it by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), who believed that Sihanouk could still be convinced to agree to ground attacks against the Base Areas.Bernard C. Nalty, Air War Over South Vietnam. Washington DC: Air Force History and Museums Program, 2000, p. 127. On 30 January 1969, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Earle Wheeler had suggested to the president that he authorize the bombing of the Cambodian sanctuaries. He was seconded on 9 February by the U.S. commander in Vietnam, General Creighton W. Abrams, who also submitted his proposal to bomb the Central Office of South Vietnam (COSVN), the elusive headquarters of PAVN/VC southern operations, located somewhere in the Fishhook region of eastern Cambodia.Karnow Vietnam p.591 Abrams claimed to Nixon that the regions of eastern Cambodia to be bombed were underpopulated and no civilian deaths would be caused, but documents showed that he and other generals were aware that eastern Cambodia was indeed populated and \\"some Cambodian casualties would be sustained in the operation\\".Karnow Vietnam p.591 The plans for the bombing was opposed by the Defense Secretary Melvin Laird who doubted the bombings could be kept secret and feared the reaction of Congress and public opinion; by the Secretary of State William P. Rogers who feared the bombings would derail the peace talks in Paris; and by the National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger who feared that Nixon was acting rashly; none made any moral objections to the bombings.Karnow Vietnam p.591 On 22 February, during the period just following the T·∫øt holidays, PAVN/VC forces launched an offensive. Nixon became even more angered when the communists launched rocket and artillery attacks against Saigon, which he considered a violation of the \\"agreement\\" he believed had been made when the US halted the bombing of North Vietnam in November 1968. Nixon, who was en route to Brussels for a meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) leaders, ordered Kissinger to prepare for airstrikes against PAVN/VC base areas in Cambodia as a reprisal. The bombings were to serve three purposes: it would show Nixon's tenacity; it would disable the PAVN's offensive capability to disrupt the US withdrawal and Vietnamization; and it would demonstrate the US' determination, \\"that might pay dividends at the negotiating table in Paris.\\"Nalty, p. 129. Nixon then cabled Colonel Alexander Haig, a National Security Council staff aide, to meet him in Brussels along with Colonel Raymond Sitton, a former Strategic Air Command (SAC) officer on the JCS staff, to formulate a plan of action.John Morocco, Operation Menu. Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1988, p. 136. Nixon would have liked to resumed bombing North Vietnam, but he was informed by the State Department that would cause the collapse of the peace talks in Paris.Karnow Vietnam p.591 Public opinion polls in 1968‚Äì1969 showed the majority of the American people supported the strategy of seeking a diplomatic solution via the Paris peace talks to the Vietnam war. The bombing of Cambodia was part of Nixon's \\"madman theory\\" that was meant to intimidate North Vietnam by showing that he was a dangerous leader capable of anything.Karnow Vietnam p.591 By seeking advice from high administration officials, Nixon had delayed any quick response that could be explicitly linked to the provocation. He decided to respond to the next provocation and didn't have to wait long. On 14 March, communist forces once again attacked South Vietnam's urban areas and Nixon was ready. On 16 March, Nixon at a meeting at the White House summoned Kissinger, Laird, Rogers and Wheeler to announce that he decided that bombing Cambodia was the \\"only way\\" to make North Vietnam compromise because he felt he had \\"to do something on the military front...something they will understand\\".Karnow Vietnam p.591 Nixon decided to keep the bombing a secret from the American people as to admit to bombing an officially neutral nation would damage his credibility and because bombing Cambodia seem like he was escalating the war.Karnow Vietnam p.591-592 Under the American constitution, the power to declare war rests with Congress, and that several constitutional experts testified before Congress in 1973 that Nixon by launching an bombing offensive in 1969 without obtaining the approval of Congress or indeed even informing Congress had committed an illegal act.Karnow Vietnam p.592 In 1969, the mood of Congress was such that it was extremely unlikely that Congress would have granted approval had Nixon asked for it, hence his decision to circumvent Congress by launching the bombing offensive while keeping it secret.Karnow Vietnam p.592  Breakfast to Dessert  Map of Base Areas used in Operation Menu In his diary in March 1969, Nixon's chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, noted that the final decision to carpet bomb Cambodia 'was made at a meeting in the Oval Office Sunday afternoon, after the church service'. In his diary on 17 March 1969, Haldeman wrote: Historic day. K[issinger]'s \\"Operation Breakfast\\" finally came off at 2:00 pm our time. K really excited, as is P[resident]. And the next day: K's \\"Operation Breakfast\\" a great success. He came beaming in with the report, very productive. A lot more secondaries than had been expected. Confirmed early intelligence. Probably no reaction for a few days, if ever. The bombing began on the night of 18 March with a raid by 60 B-52 Stratofortress bombers, based at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The target was Base Area 353, the supposed location of COSVN in the Fishhook.William Shawcross, Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon, and the Destruction of Cambodia. New York: Washington Square press, 1979, pps. 23‚Äì24. Although the aircrews were briefed that their mission was to take place in South Vietnam, 48 of the bombers were diverted across the Cambodian border and dropped 2,400 tons of bombs.John Morocco, Rain of Fire: Air War, 1969‚Äì1973. Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1985, p. 13. The mission was designated Breakfast, after the morning Pentagon planning session at which it was devised. On 18 March a 13-man Daniel Boone team from MACV-SOG was landed by helicopter at the Base Area 353 impact site to capture survivors, but they were met by intense enemy fire and only 2 of the team members were rescued. Breakfast was so successful (in U.S. terms) that General Abrams provided a list of 15 more known Base Areas for targeting.Morocco, Rain of Fire, p. 13. The five remaining missions and targets were: Lunch (Base Area 609), Snack (Base Area 351), Dinner (Base Area 352), Supper (Base Area 740), and Dessert (Base Area 350). SAC flew 3,800 B-52 sorties against these targets, and dropped 108,823 tons of ordnance during the missions. Due to the continued reference to meals in the codenames, the entire series of missions was referred to as Operation Menu. MACV-SOG provided 70 percent of the Menu bomb damage intelligenceMorocco, Operation Menu, pgs. 131‚Äì132. Nixon and Kissinger went to great lengths to keep the missions secret. In order to prevent criticism of the bombing, an elaborate dual reporting system of the missions had been formulated during the Brussels meeting between Nixon, Haig, and Colonel Sitton.  System  The number of individuals who had complete knowledge of the operation was kept to a minimum. Neither the Secretary of the Air Force nor Air Force's chief of staff were aware of the bombing of Cambodia.Karnow Vietnam p.592 All communications concerning the missions was split along two paths ‚Äì one route was overt, ordering typical B-52 missions that were to take place within South Vietnam near the Cambodian border ‚Äì the second route was covert, utilizing back-channel messages between commanders ordering the classified missions. For example: General Abrams would request a Menu strike. His request went to Admiral John S. McCain, Jr., the Commander- in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC), in Honolulu. McCain forwarded it to the JCS in Washington DC, who, after reviewing it, passed it on to Defense Secretary Laird (who might consult with the president). The JCS then passed the command for the strike to General Bruce K. Holloway, Commander of SAC, who then notified Lieutenant General Alvin C. Gillem, Commander of the 3rd Air Division on Guam. This chain of command system is covered in Nalty, p. 130. During this time Air Force Major Hal Knight was supervising an MSQ-77 Combat Skyspot radar site at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. \\"Skyspot\\" was a ground directed bombing system which directed B-52 strikes to targets in Vietnam. Each day a courier plane would arrive from SAC's Advanced Echelon Office at Tan Son Nhut Air Base near Saigon. Knight was given a revised list of target coordinates for the next day's missions. That evening, the coordinates were fed into Olivetti Programma 101 computers. and then relayed to the aircraft as they came on station. Only the pilots and navigators of the aircraft (who had been personally briefed by General Gillem and sworn to secrecy) knew of the true location of the targets.William C. Westmoreland, A Soldier Reports. Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, 1976, p. 389. The bombers then flew on to their targets and delivered their payloads. After the air strikes, Knight gathered the mission paperwork, computer tapes etc., destroying them in an incinerator. He then called a special phone number in Saigon and reported that \\"The ball game is over.\\"Morocco, Rain of Fire, p. 14. The aircrews filled out routine reports of hours flown, fuel burned, and ordnance dropped. This dual system maintained secrecy and provided Air Force logistics and personnel administrators with information that they needed to replace air crews or aircraft and replenish stocks of fuel and munitions.Nalty, p. 131.  Exposure  Although Sihanouk was not informed by the U.S. about the operation, he may have had a desire to see PAVN/VC forces out of Cambodia, since he himself was precluded from pressing them too hard.Isaacs, Hardy, & Brown, p. 89. After the event, it was claimed by Nixon and Kissinger that Sihanouk had given his tacit approval for the raids, but this is dubious.Shawcross, pps. 68‚Äì71 & 93‚Äì94. Sihanouk told U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles on 10 January 1968, that he would not oppose American \\"hot pursuit\\" of retreating North Vietnamese troops \\"in remote areas [of Cambodia],\\" provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement \\"cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids ... In any event, no one asked him. ... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval.\\" During the course of the Menu bombings, Sihanouk's government formally protested \\"American violation[s] of Cambodian territory and airspace\\" at the United Nations on over 100 occasions, although it \\"specifically protested the use of B-52s\\" only once, following an attack on Bu Chric in November 1969. On 9 May 1969, an article by military reporter William M. Beecher exposing the bombing was run in the New York Times.http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/IMG/Beecherstory.pdf Beecher claimed that an unnamed source within the administration had provided the information. Nixon was furious when he heard the news and ordered Kissinger to obtain the assistance of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover and discover the source of the leak. Hoover claimed that Kissinger had told him that \\"we will destroy whoever did this\\"..Karnow Vietnam p.592 Hoover suspected Kissinger's own NSC aide, Morton Halperin, of the deed and so informed Kissinger. Halperin's phone was then illegally tapped for 21 months.Morocco, Operation Menu, p. 141. This was the first in a series of illegal surveillance activities authorized by Nixon in the name of national security. The phones of 13 officials together with four journalists were illegally tapped by the FBI in search of finding the leak.Karnow Vietnam p.592 The administration was relieved when no other significant press reports concerning the operation appeared, and the revelation of the secret bombing of Cambodia did not cause any public outrage.Karnow Vietnam p.592 The journalist Stanley Karnow asserted that the illegal bugging in May 1969 marked \\"the first abuses of authority\\" under Nixon that ultimately led to the Watergate scandal.Karnow Vietnam p.592 Likewise, Congressman John Conyers wrote that the Operation Menu bombings led Nixon and his staff to become \\"enmeshed in the snare of lies and half-truths they themselves had created\\".Conyers \\"Why Nixon Should Have Been Impeached\\" p.3 Conyers wrote that Nixon's belief that any action done by the president was justified in name of national security, first asserted with Operation Menu, created the mindset that led him directly to the Watergate scandal.Conyers \\"Why Nixon Should Have Been Impeached\\" p.3 By the summer, five members of the United States Congress had been informed of the operation. They were: Senators John C. Stennis (MS) and Richard B. Russell, Jr. (GA) and Representatives Lucius Mendel Rivers (SC), Gerald R. Ford (MI), and Leslie C. Arends (IL). Arends and Ford were leaders of the Republican minority and the other three were Democrats on either the Armed Services or Appropriations committees. For those in Washington who were cognizant of the Menu raids, the silence of one party came as a surprise. The Hanoi government made no protest concerning the bombings. It neither denounced the raids for propaganda purposes, nor, according to Kissinger, did its negotiators \\"raise the matter during formal or secret negotiations.\\"Nalty, p. 132. North Vietnam had no wish to advertise the presence of their forces in Cambodia, allowed by Sihanouk in return for the Vietnamese agreeing not to foment rebellion in Cambodia.  Revelations  For four years Menu remained unknown to the U.S. Congress as a whole, although as previously mentioned five Congressmen had been informed. That situation changed in December 1972, when Major Knight wrote a letter to Senator William Proxmire (D, WI), asking for \\"clarification\\" as to U.S. policy on the bombing of Cambodia. Knight, who had become concerned over the legalityUCMJ Article 107 False official statements, with regard to \\"dual system\\" reporting. of his actions, had complained to his superior officer, Colonel David Patterson. He then received several bad efficiency reports, which ruined his career, and he had been discharged from the Air Force.Shawcross, p. 287. Air Force General George S. Brown, the man who informed the Senate Armed Services Committee Proxmire's further questioning led to hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which eventually demanded that the Department of Defense turn over all records of U.S. air operations in Cambodia. When they arrived, the records did not even mention the Menu strikes. The committee was not convinced and the investigation continued. Less than two weeks later, it opened hearings on the nomination of General George S. Brown for the position of chief of staff of the Air Force. As commander of the Seventh Air Force in South Vietnam, Brown had been privy to Menu and disclosed as much to the committee. For the next eight days the committee listened to the testimony of administration officials and the JCS, who tried to justify their actions. The committee uncovered excuses and deceptions that were perhaps more alarming than those occurring simultaneously in the Watergate hearings.U.S. Senate, Hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Bombing in Cambodia. United States Senate, 93rd Cong, 1st sess. Washington DC: US Government Printing Office, 1973. The Menu revelations raised \\"fundamental questions as to military discipline and honesty, of civilian control over the military and of Congressional effectiveness.\\" It was basically agreed, both by Congress and concerned military officers, that the deception employed during Menu went beyond covertness. According to Air Force historian Captain Earl H. Tilford: \\"Deception to fool the enemy was one thing, but lying to Congress and key members of the government, including the chief of staff of the Air Force and the secretary of the Air Force, was something else.\\"Earl H. Tilford, Setup: What the Air Force did in Vietnam and Why. Maxwell Air Force Base AL: Air University Press, 1991, p. 196. The Congressman Conyers wrote that the bombing of Cambodia without Congressional authorization was an illegal act which Nixon should have been impeached for. Conyers \\"Why Nixon Should Have Been Impeached\\" p.5 Conyers introduced a motion of impeachment against Nixon regarding the bombing of Cambodia on the floor of the House on 30 July 1974, which was not taken as the House was fully engaged in the Watergate scandal at the time.Conyers \\"Why Nixon Should Have Been Impeached\\" p.5 Civilian casualties There are no confirmed estimates of Cambodians killed, wounded, or rendered homeless by Operation Menu. The Department of Defense estimated that the six areas bombed in Operation Menu (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Dessert, and Supper) had a non-combatant population of 4,247. DOD planners stated that effect of attacks could tend to increase casualties, as could the probable lack of protective shelters around Cambodian homes\\".Shawcross, William Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia New York: Simon and Schuster, 1979, pp. 28‚Äì29; \\"William Shawcross vs. Peter Rodman\\", American Spectator, Vol. 14, No. 7, July 1981, accessed 31 March 2014 Each of the target areas was small. Area 353 (Breakfast), was only in size and had an estimated population of 1,640 people. B-52s flew 228 sorties into this single area to bomb. Each B-52 can carry up to 108 bombs weighing and spread them equally over a \\"box\\" about 1.5 kilometer long by one-half kilometer wide (1 mile by .3 miles); thus, nearly 25,000 bombs may have been dropped in Area 353 alone. The other target areas had similar saturation rates of bombs.Shawcross, p. 28; \\"Bombing in Cambodia\\" Hearings Before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, 93rd Congress, 1st Session, 1973, accessed 31 Mar 2014; Owen, Taylor and Kiernan, Ben, \\"Bombs Over Cambodia\\" The Walrus, October 2006, p. 67 Following Operation Menu, Operation Freedom Deal continued the bombing of Cambodia for an additional three years and extended the bombing to at least one-half of the country.  Aftermath  The constitutional issues raised at the hearings became less important when the House Judiciary Committee voted (21‚Äì12) against including the administration's falsification of records concerning Menu in the articles of impeachment leveled against President Nixon.War in the Shadows, p. 149. One of the key issues that prevented congressional inclusion was the embarrassing fact that five key members of both political parties had been privy to the information and had neither said nor done anything about it. An aerial view of bomb craters in Cambodia The consequences of U.S. bombing of Cambodia, positive and negative, are still widely debated by participants and scholars. As for preventing further PAVN/VC offensives, they failed. In May 1969, PAVN/VC launched an offensive similar in size to that of the May Offensive of the previous year. It certainly cost North Vietnam the effort and manpower to disperse and camouflage their Cambodian sanctuaries to prevent losses to further air attack. President Nixon claimed the raids were a success, since air power alone had to provide a shield for withdrawal and Vietnamization. They certainly emboldened Nixon to launch the Cambodian Campaign of 1970. While out of the country on 18 March 1970, the prince was deposed by the National Assembly and replaced by Lon Nol. The Nixon administration, although thoroughly aware of the weakness of Lon Nol's forces and loath to commit American military force to the new conflict in any form other than air power, announced its support of the newly proclaimed Khmer Republic.Shawcross, pgs. 181‚Äì182 & 194.Isaacs, Hardy, & Brown, p. 98. In response, the prince quickly aligned himself with the Khmer Rouge; this was a major boon to the communist insurgents, whose movement \\"started growing as on yeast.\\" On 29 March 1970, the PAVN launched an offensive against the Khmer National Armed Forces, with documents uncovered after 1991 from the Soviet archives revealing that the invasion was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea.Dmitry Mosyakov, \\"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives,\\" in Susan E. Cook, ed., Genocide in Cambodia and Rwanda (Yale Genocide Studies Program Monograph Series No. 1, 2004), p54ff. Available online at: www.yale.edu/gsp/publications/Mosyakov.doc \\"In April‚ÄìMay 1970, many North Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia in response to the call for help addressed to Vietnam not by Pol Pot, but by his deputy Nuon Chea. Nguyen Co Thach recalls: \\"Nuon Chea has asked for help and we have liberated five provinces of Cambodia in ten days.\\"\\" Historian Jussi Hanhim√§ki writes that \\"the MENU operations pushed the North Vietnamese forces...in east Cambodia westward. American bombers followed suit.\\" Author William Shawcross and other commentors asserted that the \\"Khmer Rouge were born out of the inferno that American policy did much to create\\" and that Sihanouk's \\"collaboration with both powers [the United States and North Vietnam] ... was intended to save his people by confining the conflict to the border regions. It was American policy that engulfed the nation in war.\\"Shawcross, p. 396 Shawcross was challenged by former Kissinger aide Peter Rodman as follows: > When Congress, in the summer of 1973, legislated an end to U.S. military > action in, over, or off the shores of Indochina, the only U.S. military > activity then going on was air support of a friendly Cambodian government > and army desperately defending their country against a North Vietnamese and > Khmer Rouge onslaught ...

Kissinger in an interview with Theo Sommer defended the bombing, saying: > People usually refer to the bombing of Cambodia as if it had been > unprovoked, secretive U.S. action. The fact is that we were bombing North > Vietnamese troops that had invaded Cambodia, that were killing many > Americans from these sanctuaries, and we were doing it with the acquiescence > of the Cambodian government, which never once protested against it, and > which, indeed, encouraged us to do it. I may have a lack of imagination, but > I fail to see the moral issue...Shawcross, p.395 The simultaneous rise of the Khmer Rouge and the increase in area and intensity of U.S. bombing between 1969 and 1973 has incited speculation as to the relationship between the two events. Ben Kiernan, Director of the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University, said the following: > Apart from the large human toll, perhaps the most powerful and direct impact > of the bombing was the political backlash it caused ...

By 1975, President Ford was predicting \\"new horrors\\" if the Khmer Rouge took power, and calling on Congress to provide additional economic, humanitarian, and military aid for Cambodia and Vietnam.\\"Transcript of President‚Äôs News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters\\", The New York Times, 7 March 1975.

If the model building physicist uses the tools of string theory, he or she is called \\"superstring model builder\\". A model builder typically chooses new quantum fields and their new interactions, attempting to make their combination realistic, testable and physically interesting. In particular, an interesting new model should address questions left unanswered in the Standard Model which has, including three massive neutrinos, 28 free parameters. A model which extends the Standard Model should predict one or more of these parameters or shed light on some other issue such as why there are three quark-lepton families or, the most common motivation, the naturalness or hierarchy problem associated with the quadratic divergences appearing in the scalar sector. The work of model builders Model builders constitute a group between experimentalists and \\"pure\\" theorists; model builders are theorists, but with an emphasis on using current tools to fit data, in addition to the more long-term pursuit of a more complete theory of nature. Model builders are one step closer to pure theorists than phenomenologists are, although the distinction is often blurred in practice. Model building is speculative because current particle accelerators can only probe up to a few TeV, where physics is well described by the Standard Model. One result of renormalization group theory is that at low energies, models flow toward universality classes and different models may flow to the same universality class so many models can coexist beyond the Standard Model. Only experimental data will distinguish between them. All experimental attempts to look for irrelevant couplings beyond the Standard Model, such as those that give rise to proton decay, flavor changing neutral currents, Peskin‚ÄìTakeuchi parameters and nonuniversal couplings have so far come up only with upper bounds. However, the observation of neutrino oscillations could be explained by adding a Majorana neutrino mass, which is an irrelevant coupling that could arise, e.g., from the seesaw mechanism. There may be patterns among the marginal and relevant couplings so that among all the possible models which give rise to the Standard Model universality class, one of them has fewer free parameters than the others allowing it to make predictions. It is an article of faith amongst some model builders in particle physics that there exists an elegant high-energy theory or UV completion of the Standard Model.

Background The Canada Grain Act was passed in 19122 Geo. V, (Can.) ch. 27 (1912), which was added to the Act by 9-10 Geo. V, ch. 40 (1919), and further amended by 10 Geo. V, ch. 6 (1919, 2nd session) to control and regulate, through The Board of Grain Commissioners,replaced in 1971 by the Canadian Grain Commission the trade in grain. It provided for: :* the licensing of all owners and operators of elevators, warehouses and mills and certain traders in grain; :* the supervision of the handling and storage of grain in and out of elevators, etc.; and :* the prohibition of persons operating or interested in a terminal elevator from buying or selling grain, as well as :* provisions for inspection and grading. The Act was amended in 1919 by adding s. 95(7) which provided that, if at the end of any crop year in any terminal elevator \\"the total surplus of grain is found in excess of one-quarter of one per cent of the gross amount of the grain received in the elevator during the crop year,\\" such surplus would be sold for the benefit of the Board. For the 1920 crop year, Eastern Elevator was determined to have a surplus of 1,107,330 pounds, found in its elevator at Port Arthur, Ontario. The Board commenced an action in the Exchequer Court of Canada to recover the value of such grain, which was calculated to be $43,431. Eastern Elevator, in its defence, pleaded there was no surplus, and that s. 95(7), as well as The Canada Grain Act itself, always were and are now ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. At the Exchequer Court Alexander Kenneth Maclean, President of the Exchequer Court, confined his ruling to the effect of s. 95(7) only, determining it to be ultra vires. In stating this, he ruled that: :* it dealt with the right of ownership of the surplus of grain, as well as :* being an attempt to regulate profits or dealings which give rise to profits, both of which fell within the provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights. The ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court. At the Supreme Court of Canada The Exchequer Court's ruling was affirmed. In his ruling, Duff J held that the marketing of grain, even though it was all destined for export (some of the grain stored on the site was for local markets), fell under provincial jurisdiction with respect to property and civil rights.Eastern Elevator, pp. 446447 However, the Parliament of Canada could still assume jurisdiction if it invoked its power with respect to works and undertakings.Eastern Elevator, p. 448 Mignault J, in his ruling, also rejected the idea that the matter could be regarded as a \\"national emergency\\" under the residual peace, order and good government power. He also rejected the federal contention that s. 95(7) could be supported under s. 95 of the British North America Act, as it dealt not with agriculture but with a product of agriculture, and therefore was an article of trade.Eastern Elevator, p. 457 Anglin CJC, in dissent, held that the Act could be upheld as a matter of national concern, citing jurisprudence dating back to Russell v. The Queen.Eastern Elevator, pp. 442444 Impact Following the decision, the Canada Grain Act was amended to declare all grain elevators in Canada to be federal \\"works and undertakings\\" for the general advantage of Canada.Canada Grain Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. G-10, s. 55 Eastern Elevator was subsequently cited in 1936 by Duff CJ in his ruling in the Natural Products Marketing Reference, which was cited with approval by Lord Atkin on appeal to the Privy Council. Lord Atkin's approval was later cited in support of the Privy Council's 1950 ruling in the Margarine Reference, in that part dealing with the federal trade and commerce power. The decision represents a high point of the Supreme Court's adoption of the Privy Council's view of an exceptionally narrow interpretation of the federal government's trade and commerce power, which began to be relaxed in 1971 in Caloil Inc. v.

It is a bicameral body composed of the House of Representatives and Senate. It is one of the few state legislatures in which members of both chambers serve four-year terms and in which all are elected in the same cycle. The most recent election was on November 6, 2018. The new legislature assumes office immediately following the certification of the election results by the Alabama Secretary of State which occurs within a few days following the election. The Legislature meets in the Alabama State House in Montgomery. The original capitol building, located nearby, has not been used by the Legislature on a regular basis since 1985, when it closed for renovations. In the 21st century, it serves as the seat of the executive branch as well as a museum. History Jefferson Davis being sworn in as President of the Confederate States of America on February 18, 1861, on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol. Establishment The Alabama Legislature was founded in 1818 as a territorial legislature for the Alabama Territory. Following the federal Alabama Enabling Act of 1819 and the successful passage of the first Alabama Constitution in the same year, the Alabama General Assembly became a fully fledged state legislature upon the territory's admission as a state. The term of state representatives is two years and the term of state senators is four years. The General Assembly was one of the 11 state legislatures of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Following the state's secession from the Union in January 1861, delegates from across the South met at the state capital of Montgomery to create the Confederate government. Between February and May 1861, Montgomery served as the Confederacy's capital, where Alabama state officials let members of the new Southern federal government make use of its offices. The Provisional Confederate Congress met for three months inside the General Assembly's chambers at the Alabama State Capitol. Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the Confederacy's first and only president on the steps of the capitol. However, following complaints from Southerners over Montgomery's uncomfortable conditions and, more importantly, following Virginia's entry into the Confederacy, the Confederate government moved to Richmond in May 1861. Reconstruction era Following the Confederacy's defeat in 1865, the state government underwent a transformation following emancipation of enslaved African Americans, and constitutional amendments to grant them citizenship and voting rights. Congress dominated the next period of Reconstruction, which some historians attribute to Radical Republicans. For the first time, blacks could vote and were elected to the legislature. Republicans were elected to the state governorship and dominated the General Assembly; more than eighty percent of the members were white. In 1867, a state constitutional convention was called, and a biracial group of delegates worked on a new constitution. The biracial legislature passed a new constitution in 1868, establishing public education for the first time, as well as institutions such as orphanages and hospitals to care for all the citizens of the state. This constitution, which affirmed the franchise for freedmen, enabled Alabama to be readmitted into the United States in 1868. As in other states during Reconstruction, former Confederate and insurgent \\"redeemer\\" forces from the Democratic Party gradually overturned the Republicans by force and fraud. Elections were surrounded by violence as paramilitary groups aligned with the Democrats worked to suppress black Republican voting. By the 1874 state general elections, the General Assembly was dominated by white Bourbon Democrats from the elite planter class. Both the resulting 1875 and 1901 constitutions disenfranchised blacks, and the 1901 also adversely affected thousands of poor whites, by erecting barriers to voter registration. Late in the 19th century, a Populist-Republican coalition had gained three congressional seats from Alabama and some influence in the state legislature. After suppressing this movement, Democrats returned to power, gathering support under slogans of white supremacy. They passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites, excluding them from the political system for decades into the late 20th century. The Democratic-dominated legislature passed Jim Crow laws creating legal segregation and second-class status for African Americans. The 1901 Constitution changed the name of the General Assembly to the Alabama Legislature. (Amendment 427 to the Alabama Constitution designated the State House as the official site of the legislature.) Civil Rights era Following World War II, the state capital was a site of important Civil Rights Movement activities. In December 1955 Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white passenger on a segregated city bus. She and other African-American residents conducted the more than year-long Montgomery bus boycott to end discriminatory practices on the buses, 80% of whose passengers were African Americans. Both Parks and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., a new pastor in the city who led the movement, gained national and international prominence from these events. Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the Alabama Legislature and a series of succeeding segregationist governors massively resisted school integration and demands of social justice by Civil Rights protesters. During this period, the Legislature passed a law authorizing the Alabama State Sovereignty Commission. Mirroring Mississippi's similarly named authority, the commission used taxpayer dollars to function as a state intelligence agency: it spied on Alabama residents suspected of sympathizing with the Civil Rights Movement (and classified large groups of people, such as teachers, as potential threats). It kept lists of suspected African-American activists and participated in economic boycotts against them, such as getting suspects fired from jobs and evicted from rentals, disrupting their lives and causing financial distress. It also passed on the names of suspected activists to local governments and citizens' groups such as the White Citizens Council, which also followed tactics to penalize activists and enforce segregation. Following a federal constitutional amendment banning use of poll taxes in federal elections, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 authorizing federal oversight and enforcement of fair registration and elections, and the 1966 US Supreme Court ruling that poll taxes at any level were unconstitutional, African Americans began to register and vote again in numbers proportional to their population. They were elected again to the state legislature and county and city offices for the first time since the late 19th century. Federal court cases increased political representation for all residents of the state in a different way. Although required by its state constitution to redistrict after each decennial census, the Alabama legislature had not done so from the turn of the century to 1960. In addition, state senators were elected from geographic counties. As a result, representation in the legislature did not reflect the state's changes in population, and was biased toward rural interests. It had not kept up with the development of major urban, industrialized cities such as Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. Their residents paid much more in taxes and revenues to the state government than they received in services. Services and investment to support major cities had lagged due to under-representation in the legislature. Under the principle of one man, one vote, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. Sims (1964) that both houses of any state legislature need to be based on population, with apportionment of seats redistricted as needed according to the decennial census.REYNOLDS v. SIMS, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), FindLaw, accessed 12 March 2015 This was a challenge brought by citizens of Birmingham. When this ruling was finally implemented in Alabama by court order in 1972, it resulted in the districts including major industrial cities gaining more seats in the legislature. In May 2007, the Alabama Legislature officially apologized for slavery, making it the fourth Deep South state to do so. Constitutions Alabama has had a total of six different state constitutions, passed in 1819, 1861, 1865, 1868, 1875, and 1901. The current constitution (1901) has had so many amendments, most related to decisions on county-level issues, that it is the longest written constitution in both the United States and the world. Because the Alabama legislature has kept control of most counties, authorizing home rule for only a few, it passes numerous laws and amendments that deal only with county-level issues. Due to the suppression of black voters after Reconstruction, and especially after passage of the 1901 disenfranchising constitution, most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites were excluded from voting for decades.J. Morgan Kousser.The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974Glenn Feldman, The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp. 135‚Äì136 After Reconstruction ended no blacks served in the Alabama Legislature until 1974 when two black majority districts in the House elected Thomas Reed and Fred Gray. As of the 2018 election, the Alabama House of Representatives has 27 African-American members and the Alabama State Senate has 7 African-American members. Most blacks did not regain the power to vote until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Before that, many left the state in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities. Since the late 20th century, the white majority in the state has voted increasingly Republican. In the 2010 elections, for the first time in 136 years, both houses of the state legislature were dominated by Republicans. Republicans have maintained their majority status in the succeeding elections in 2014 and 2018. Organization The Alabama Legislature convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except during the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March. In the last year of a four-year term, the legislative session begins on the second Tuesday in January. The length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Session weeks consist of meetings of the full chamber and committee meetings. The Governor of Alabama can call, by proclamation, special sessions of the Alabama Legislature and must list the subjects to be considered. Special sessions are limited to 12 legislative days within a 30 calendar day span. In a regular session, bills may be enacted on any subject. In a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the governor announces on their proclamation or \\"call.\\" Anything not in the \\"call\\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted. Legislative process Alabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states. Notice and introduction of bills Prior to the introduction of bills that apply to specific, named localities, the Alabama Constitution requires publication of the proposal in a newspaper in the counties to be affected. The proposal must be published for four consecutive weeks and documentation must be provided to show that the notice was posted. The process is known as \\"notice and proof.\\" Article 4, Section 45 of the state constitution mandates that each bill may only pertain to one subject, clearly stated in the bill title, \\"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\\". Committees As with other legislative bodies throughout the world, the Alabama legislature operates mainly through committees when considering proposed bills. The Constitution of Alabama states that no bill may be enacted into law until it has been referred to, acted upon by, and returned from, a standing committee in each house. Reference to committee immediately follows the first reading of the bill. Bills are referred to committees by the presiding officer. The state constitution authorizes each house to determine the number of committees, which varies from quadrennial session to session. Each committee is set up to consider bills relating to a particular subject. =Legislative Council= The Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows: *From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate; *From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House. *The majority and minority leaders of each house. The Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. Committee reports After a committee completes work on a bill, it reports the bill to the appropriate house during the \\"reports of committees\\" in the daily order of business. Reported bills are immediately given a second reading. The houses do not vote on a bill at the time it is reported; however, reported bills are placed on the calendar for the next legislative day. The second reading is made by title only. Local bills concerning environmental issues affecting more than one political subdivision of the state are given a second reading when reported from the local legislation committee and re- referred to a standing committee where they are then considered as a general bill. Bills concerning gambling are also re-referred when reported from the local legislation committee but they continue to be treated as local bills. When reported from the second committee, these bills are referred to the calendar and do not require another second reading. The regular calendar is a list of bills that have been favorably reported from committee and are ready for consideration by the membership of the entire house. Bills are listed on the calendar by number, sponsor, and title, in the order in which they are reported from committee. They must be considered for a third reading in that order unless action is taken to consider a bill out of order. Important bills are brought to the top of the calendar by special orders or by suspending the rules. To become effective, the resolution setting special orders must be adopted by a majority vote of the house. These special orders are recommended by the Rules Committee of each house. The Rules Committee is not restricted to making its report during the Call of Committees, and can report at any time. This enables the committee to determine the order of business for the house. This power makes the Rules Committee one of the most influential of the legislative committees. Any bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a fiscal note. Fiscal notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law. Third reading A bill is placed on the calendar for adoption for its third reading. It is at this third reading of the bill that the whole house gives consideration to its passage. At this time, the bill may be studied in detail, debated, amended, and read at length before final passage. Once the bill is discussed, each member casts his or her vote, and their name is called alphabetically to record their vote. Since the state's Senate has only 35 members, voting may be done effectively in that house by a roll call of the members. The membership of the House is three times larger, with 105 members; since individual roll-call voice votes are time consuming, an electronic voting machine is used in the House of Representatives. The House members vote by pushing buttons on their desks, and their votes are indicated by colored lights which flash on a board in the front of the chamber. The board lists each member name and shows how each member voted. The votes are electronically recorded in both houses. If a majority of the members who are present and voting in each house vote against a bill, or if there is a tie vote, it fails passage. If the majority vote in favor of the bill, its approval is recorded as passing. If amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house. Transmission to second house A bill that is passed in one house is transmitted, along with a formal message, to the other house. Such messages are always in order and are read (in the second house) at any suitable pause in business. After the message is read, the bill receives its first reading, by title only, and is referred to committee. In the second house, a bill must pass successfully through the same steps of procedure as in the first house. If the second house passes the bill without amendment, the bill is sent back to the house of origin and is ready for enrollment, which is the preparation of the bill in its final form for transmittal to the governor. However, the second house may amend the bill and pass it as amended. Since a bill must pass both houses in the same form, the bill with amendment is sent back to the house of origin for consideration of the amendment. If the bill is not reported from committee or is not considered by the full house, the bill is defeated. The house of origin, upon return of its amended bill, may take any one of several courses of action. It may concur in the amendment by the adoption of a motion to that effect; then the bill, having been passed by both houses in identical form, is ready for enrollment. Another possibility is that the house of origin may adopt a motion to non- concur in the amendment, at which point the bill dies. Finally, the house of origin may refuse to accept the amendment but request that a conference committee be appointed. The other house usually agrees to the request, and the presiding officer of each house appoints members to the conference committee. Conference committees A conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and assigned members try to reach an agreement on the content so that the bill can be passed by both houses. If an agreement is reached and if both houses adopt the conference committee's report, the bill is passed. If either house refuses to adopt the report of the conference committee, a motion may be made for further conference. If a conference committee is unable to reach an agreement, it may be discharged, and a new conference committee may be appointed. Highly controversial bills may be referred to several different conference committees. If an agreement is never reached in conference prior to the end of the legislative session, the bill is lost. When a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \\"enrolled\\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. Once a bill has been enrolled, it is sent back to the house of origin, where it must be read again (unless this reading is dispensed with by a two-thirds vote), and signed by the presiding officer in the presence of the members. The bill is then sent to the other house where the presiding officer in the presence of all the members of that house also signs it. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the governor. Presentation to the governor Once a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law. From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision. If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it. Vetoed bills return to the house in which they originated, with a message explaining the governor's objections and suggesting amendments that might remove those objections. The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the governor, as he revised it, for his signature. The governor is also permitted the line-item veto on appropriations bills. In contrast to the practice of most states and the federal government (which require a supermajority, usually 2/3, to override a veto), a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto. If the governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature. This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the governor's signature. The bills that reach the governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \\"pocket veto\\". This is the most conclusive form of veto, since state lawmakers have no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure. Constitutional amendments Legislation that would change the state constitution takes the form of a constitutional amendment. A constitutional amendment is introduced and takes the same course as a bills or resolution, except it must be read at length on three different days in each house, must pass each house by a three-fifths vote of the membership, and it does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Alabama Secretary of State. It is then submitted to voters at an election held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which state lawmakers proposed the amendment. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Alabama Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.

XVT is a software development environment for building cross-platform GUI applications in C or C++. XVT allows developers to graphically lay out an application's GUI, and provides cross- platform libraries to aid development. XVT has been in development since 1989 and has provided a cross-platform software development toolkit for the majority of that time. XVT software is utilized in a number of mission- critical production sites and applications. Their approach is not as a widget replacement look-alike set, but acts more like a universal API translator. XVT is an \\"abstraction layer\\" that removes the developer from being concerned with which OS the application will run on. When your application is compiled, the XVT API points to the native controls/widgets for the OS on which you are compiling your code. This matters to OS user-purists, who can be very fussy when the views \\"aren't quite right.\\" It also allows you to build applications that will adapt whatever user themes the OS allows users to set. There are other uses of this product beyond cross platform development (though it does this well). As a CASE tool, a non-programmer business analyst can actually lay out all the user interfaces, review them with end users and subject matter experts in a RAD-like (Rapid Application Development) requirements capture by functional review, and then the XVT architect tool will deliver the C or C++ (ANSI-compliant) code. This would take a bit of familiarity with a compiler and the layout tools, but it would allow programmers to be relieved of coding GUI and focus their work on the business logic, event handling, etc. The developers have announced support for GTK+ on Linux and Cocoa on Mac, but these ports are not yet available. Because Microsoft no longer support the HLP help format, XVT applications require the user to install the Microsoft .hlp viewer. XVT was originally developed by Advanced Programming Institute in Boulder Co., a company founded by former Bell Labs employee Marc Rochkind. The company changed its name to XVT when that product became the main company effort. The XVT product was purchased by Providence Software Solutions, Inc. in 2001. Platforms XVT currently supports: * Windows * Linux * OS X * Solaris * HP-UX * AIX With XVT, applications can be designed and developed once and then subsequently compiled on any of these platforms. Editions=XVT DSC XVT DSC includes the PTK, or Portability ToolKit, and the XVT Design interface designer. It is designed for use with C. XVT DSP XVT DSP includes the PTK, Power++ library (C++ bindings to the PTK), and the XVT Architect interface designer. It is designed for use with C++. XVT Net XVT Net allows applications built using either of the other editions to be recompiled as a networked application. The application may then be run on a server which thin clients can connect to in order to use the application.

According to quantum field theory, the mass of the Higgs boson must be rather light for the electroweak theory to work. However, the loop corrections to the mass are naturally much greater; this is known as the hierarchy problem. New physical effects such as supersymmetry may in principle reduce the size of the loop corrections, making the theory natural. However, it is known from experiments that new physics such as superpartners does not occur at very low energy scales, so even if these new particles reduce the loop corrections, they do not reduce them enough to make the renormalized Higgs mass completely natural. The expected value of the Higgs mass is about 10 percent of the size of the loop corrections which shows that a certain \\"little\\" amount of fine-tuning seems necessary.

The model is popular among some model builders, but has resisted being embedded into string theory. Overview The DGP model assumes the existence of a 4+1-dimensional Minkowski space, within which ordinary 3+1-dimensional Minkowski space is embedded. The model assumes an action consisting of two terms: One term is the usual Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action, which involves only the 4-D spacetime dimensions. The other term is the equivalent of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action, as extended to all 5 dimensions. The 4-D term dominates at short distances, and the 5-D term dominates at long distances. The model was proposed in part in order to reproduce the cosmic acceleration of dark energy without any need for a small but non-zero vacuum energy density. But critics argue that this branch of the theory is unstable. However, the theory remains interesting because of Dvali's claim that the unusual structure of the graviton propagator makes non-perturbative effects important in a seemingly linear regime, such as the solar system. Because there is no four-dimensional, linearized effective theory that reproduces the DGP model for weak-field gravity, the theory avoids the vDVZ discontinuity that otherwise plagues attempts to write down a theory of massive gravity. In 2008, Fang et al. argued that recent cosmological observations (including measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and measurements of the cosmic microwave background and type 1a supernovae) is in direct conflict with the DGP cosmology unless a cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy is added. However, this negates the appeal of the DGP cosmology, which accelerates without needing to add dark energy.

The United States Navy brig , commanded by Lieutenant William Burrows, defeated the Royal Navy gun-brig , led by Commander Samuel Blyth. Constructed as a schooner in Maryland in 1799, the victorious American was rebuilt as a brig prior to the war. She met an inglorious end, wrecking in the West Indies in 1823. However, her name carried on. A number of following U.S. Navy warships bore the name. The Boxer was auctioned for $9,775 to benefit her captors, and she served as a local merchantman for some years. Battle On 5 September 1813, USS Enterprise with fourteen 18-pound carronades and two 9-pound long guns and 102 men sighted HMS Boxer with twelve 18-pound carronades and two 6-pound long guns and 66 men off Pemaquid Point, Maine. After six hours of maneuvering, the antagonists finally engaged. Blyth prepared for a fight to the finish. He ordered a Union Jack nailed to the foremast and two on the mainmast. In Enterprise, Burrows demonstrated similar resolve. He moved one of his two long 9-pounders from the bow to a stern port, and tradition indicates he declared: \\"We are going to fight both ends and both sides of this ship as long as the ends and the sides hold together.\\" When the firing commenced, the ships were eight miles southeast of Seguin. When it ended, according to William Barnes, a member of the American crew and later a respected mariner from Woolwich, the ships were \\"some four or five miles east from Pemaquid point, four miles southwest of East Egg Rock . . . and about seven miles west north west of Monhegan.\\" Ellis, p. 136. Boxer was in the area, having for a fee escorted an American merchantman with Swedish papers from New Brunswick to the Kennebec River. Within half pistol shot, the two brigs opened fire. \\"Great God, what shots!\\" exclaimed Blyth an instant before being killed during the initial fusillades. Moments later, while helping his crew run out a carronade, a musket ball tore into Burrow's thigh. He fell to the deck mortally wounded, but refused to be carried below. The fierce contest ended in 30 minutes. Command of Enterprise devolved to Lieutenant Edward McCall, while Lieutenant David McGrery had assumed command of the battered Boxer. Towards the end, McGrery described his ship as a complete wreck with three feet of water in the hold. The flags on the mainmast were shot away, but the Englishman's colors remained nailed to the foremast; \\"but his tongue was not fastened and he called for quarters. . ..\\"Niles' Weekly Register, September 18, 1813. The dying Lieutenant Burrows declined to accept Commander Blyth's sword, directing it be sent to the family of the dead British captain. \\"I am satisfied, I die contented,\\" Lieutenant Burrows exclaimed. McCall returned to Portland to the southwest with the two ships and the casualties. An American court-martial charged Sailing Master William Harper and Isaac Bowman, captain's clerk, with cowardice. Captain Isaac Hull dismissed the Bowman complaint, and the court acquitted Harper. However, at Bermuda, a British court martial found its acting master's mate and three seamen \\"through cowardice, negligence, or disaffection\\" deserted their quarters during the action.Ellis, pp 141-142.Lohnes (1973), p.326. Aftermath Newspapers in the United States rejoiced in \\"another brilliant naval victory.\\" After two days of planning, authorities conducted an impressive state funeral for the two commanders, and they rest side by side in Portland's Eastern Cemetery. Next to them is the comparable grave of Lieutenant Kerwin Waters who suffered mortal wounds as a midshipman during the battle but lived for two more years. Quotation Picture of the event \\" The captain of HMS Boxer, Commander Samuel Blyth, was killed early in the action by a cannon ball; had he lived he might have defended his ship more desperately, but it is not probable with more success. He was an officer of distinguished merit; having received a sword from government for his good conduct under Sir James L. Yeo, in the capture of Cayenne. Blyth was also one of the pall-bearers of our lamented James Lawrence, when buried at Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was his fate now to receive like courtesy at the hands of his enemy. His remains, in company with those of the brave Burrows, were brought to Portland, where they were interred with military honours in Eastern Cemetery. It was a striking and affecting sight, to behold two gallant commanders, who had lately been arrayed in deadly hostility against each other, descending into one quiet grave, there to mingle their dust peacefully together. \\"Washington Irving, Analectic Nagazine, November 1813 This battle was referenced by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his poem \\"My Lost Youth\\": > \\"I remember the sea-fight far away, > How it thundered o'er the tide! > And the dead captains, as they lay > In their graves, o'erlooking the tranquil bay > Where they in battle died. > And the sound of that mournful song > Goes through me with a thrill: > \\"A boy's will is the wind's will, > And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\\" References * Ellis, James H.

It is associated with several well-known composers such as Richard Wagner and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and especially Johann Sebastian Bach, who worked here as a Kapellmeister (music director) from 1723 until his death in 1750. Today, the church also holds his remains. Martin Luther preached here in 1539. Although rebuilt over the centuries and damaged by Allied incendiary bombs in 1943, the church today mainly retains the character of a late-Gothic hall church. The Thomanerchor, the choir of the Thomaskirche, likely founded in 1212, remains a well-known boys' choir. History There has been a church at the current site of the Thomaskirche at least since the 12th century. Foundations of a Romanesque building have been discovered in the choir and crossing of the current church. Between 1212 and 1222 the earlier structure became the church of the new St. Thomas Monastery (Stift) of the Augustinian order founded by Markgraf Dietrich von Meissen. This monastery later became the core of the University of Leipzig (founded in 1409). In 1217, The Minnesinger, or troubadour (see Minnesang), Heinrich von Morungen bequeathed to the church a relic of St. Thomas as he entered the order of canons after a trip to India. In 1355, the Romanesque choir was changed to Gothic style. Following an inflow of wealth into Leipzig from the discovery of silver in the Erzgebirge, the Romanesque nave was demolished and replaced in 1482-96 by the current late-Gothic hall church. The current building was consecrated by Thilo of Trotha, the Bishop of Merseburg, on 10 April 1496. The reformer Martin Luther preached here on Pentecost Sunday in 1539. The monastic buildings were demolished in 1541 following the monastery's dissolution. The current church tower was first built in 1537 and rebuilt in 1702. Chapels added in the 17th century and an ante-building along the northern front of the nave with two stairways were removed at the end of the 19th century. Statue of Johann Sebastian Bach at the Thomaskirche Bach's grave beneath the floor of the choir (sanctuary) of the church The composer Johann Sebastian Bach was choir director of music at St. Thomas Church from 1723 until his death in 1750 and taught at its affiliated school. A statue of Johann Sebastian Bach by the Leipzig sculptor Carl Seffner that stands next to the church was dedicated in 1908. On 12 May 1789, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played the organ here. In 1806, the church served as a munitions depot for the French army. During the Battle of Leipzig, the Thomaskirche was used as a military hospital. Richard Wagner was baptized here on 16 August 1813.Kirchliches Archiv Leipzig (Church Archives of Leipzig): Taufbuch Thomas 1811-1817 (Baptismal Book for St. Thomas 1811-1817), p. 156 In 1828, he studied piano and counterpoint with the then Thomaskantor, Christian Th. Weinlig.The Great Composers, Michael Steen, p. 461 Most of the Baroque internal trappings of the church known to Bach were removed in a Gothic revival renovation of 1884‚Äì9. Also from this period date the pulpit and the main portal in the west facade. On 4 December 1943, the tower was damaged in an Allied bombing raid on Leipzig, requiring repair. The authorities demolished the Johanneskirche, also damaged by bombs in 1943, in 1949 and the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach were moved from there to the Thomaskirche in 1950. In the 20th century, sulfur emitted from nearby coal mines, and other pollutants in the atmospheric air caused the deterioration of exterior stonework and statuary, and even of interior Gothic paintings. In addition, the roof structure suffered from damage due to insects and moisture. For these reasons, the church was listed in the 2000 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.World Monuments Fund - Thomaskirche Repairs were swiftly undertaken with financial support from the Fund and from American Express. Repairs on the church in 1961 to 1964 also attempted to emphasize the Gothic hall church character of the building. Another renovation followed in 1991. From 1993 to 2014, a 15th-century Gothic altar (originally in the Paulinerkirche, the church of the University of Leipzig, destroyed in 1968 by the Communist authorities) was located in the Thomaskirche. It was moved to the new St. Pauli church (2014) and replaced in 2016 with a Gothic-revival altar by Constantin Lipsius made in 1888, which had been removed in 1964. Mendelssohn statue A statue of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who lived in Leipzig from 1835 until his death in 1847, was dedicated on 18 October 2008, when it was re-erected opposite the St. Thomas Church on the occasion of the year of his 200th birthday. The statue depicts the former Gewandhaus Orchestra director and composer in bronze. Celebratory speeches were given by Kurt Masur, also a former Gewandhaus Orchestra director, and Burkhard Jung, mayor of Leipzig. The original statue designed by Werner Stein was first dedicated on 26 May 1892. It had been located on the east side of the Gewandhaus until 9 November 1936, when it was taken down by the Nazis because of the composer's Jewish background. Description The churches measures 76 meters in length, of which the nave accounts for 50 meters. The nave is 25 meters wide and its walls reach a maximum height of 18 meters. The church's roof is unusually steep with a roof pitch of 63 degrees. It rises to a crown that is 45 meters high. The tower is 68 meters in height. Works of art The church features a number of works of art, including a baptismal font (1614-5) made by Franz D√∂teber and Portraits show the Stadtsuperintenden of Leipzig, the oldest dating from 1614. A crucifix made by Caspar Freidrich L√∂bel is one of the few remaining pieces from the times of Bach. The church also contains a number of notable epitaphs, such as the one for the knight Harras (d. 1451) and for councilor Daniel Leicher (1612). The colored windows in the choir were added after 1889. They show a number of historic motives: a memorial to the fallen of World War I, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, Johann Sebastian Bach, Martin Luther with Elector Friedrich der Weise and Philip Melanchthon as well as Emperor Wilhelm I. Tomb of Johann Sebastian Bach The remains of Johann Sebastian Bach have been buried in the Thomaskirche since 1950. After his death on 28 July 1750, Bach was laid to rest in the hospital cemetery of the Johanniskirche in Leipzig. With the start of the Bach renaissance in the 19th century, the public started to become interested in his remains and their whereabouts. In 1894, the anatomy professor Wilhelm His was commissioned to identify the composer's remains amongst disinterred bones from the cemetery where Bach had been buried. He concluded that \\"the assumption that the bones of an elderly man, which had been found in an oak coffin near the Johanneskirche, were the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach\\" (translated from German) was very likely. On 16 July 1900 the bones were placed into a stone sarcophagus underneath the Johanniskirche. Following the bombardment of the Johanniskirche on 4 December 1943, the bones were transferred to the Thomaskirche. The new grave with a bronze cover was inaugurated on 28 July 1950, 200 years after the death of the composer, who is now buried in the sanctuary of the Thomaskirche. Organs Another notable feature of the Thomaskirche is that it contains two organs. The older one is a Romantic organ by Wilhelm Sauer, built from 1884‚Äì89. Since this organ was considered \\"unsuitable\\" for Bach's music, a second organ was built in 1966/7 (by Alexander Schuke). This was later replaced in 1999/2000 by a new organ, built by Gerald Woehl's organ building company from 1999‚Äì2000. This \\"Bach organ\\" was designed to look similar to the instrument on which Bach had played in the Paulinerkirche. Church bells There are four bells in the St. Thomas bell tower. The largest is the Gloriosa, which was cast by Theodericus Reinhard in 1477. It weighs 5200 kg, has a diameter of 2.04 meters, and a strike pitch of a¬∞. It is used on days of celebration. The second-largest bell was cast by Wolf Hilliger in 1574 and has a strike note of c‚Ä≤. The third largest bell is called either the Monks‚Äô or Confessional Bell (M√∂nchs- oder Beichtglocke), which has a strike pitch of d‚Ä≤. Jakob K√∂nig cast it in 1634 and it serves as the hourly bell. The fourth bell was cast by Christophorus Gros in 1585 and has a strike note of f‚Ä≥. Its resonance is dampened by shortened yokes from which it hangs. The tower lantern holds separately a bell that is rung each quarter-hour. This bell was cast in 1539 by the Schilling bell foundry in Apolda. It was modelled on its predecessor. Choir The Thomanerchor, the choir of the Thomaskirche, was founded in 1212 and is one of the oldest and most famous boys' choirs in Germany. It is headed by the Thomaskantor, an office that has been held by many well-known composers and musicians, including Johann Sebastian Bach from 1723 until his death in 1750.

Bottom right: NeoFio. is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the PlayStation video game console. It is the successor to Chrono Trigger, which was released in 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. While its predecessor, like most role-playing games at the time, only offered a handful of playable characters, Chrono Cross was notable for making 45 different characters available for recruitment over the course of the game, each with distinct backstory and speech patterns. The game's writer, Masato Kato, started with the core characters from Radical Dreamers, a rare, Japan-only visual novel he felt ultimately went unfinished, and greatly expanded the cast and scenario, while leaving the creation of some minor characters to various other members of the development team. The developers also created an \\"auto accent program\\", to apply accents and other quirks to character's dialogue, making the dialogue altered depending on who was present in the player's party. Reception for the game from critics was very positive, with some publications, such as GameSpot, even giving the game a perfect score. However, reception for the cast of characters was more mixed; some critics were impressed by the quantity, variety, and individuality offered by the characters, where others complained of an emphasis of \\"quantity over quality\\". Creation and influences=Radical Dreamers A few of the core characters from Chrono Cross originate from an earlier game titled Radical Dreamers. Chrono series writer Masato Kato felt that the first game in the series, Chrono Trigger, did not wrap up all its story arcs, and as such, wrote the story of Radical Dreamers to conclude some aspects of it. However, due to the rushed nature of the development schedule, it being a short, text based visual novel, and being released on an obscure add-on for the Super Famicom, the Satellaview, Kato would label the game \\"unfinished\\", leading to the conception of a more complete game, which would be Chrono Cross. Serge, Kid, Lynx, Viper, Radius, and Riddel all originate from the game. Additionally, the Radical Dreamers character Magil, who is an amnesiac Magus from Chrono Trigger, was originally going to be the character Guile in Chrono Cross, before Kato wrote him out of the script, fearing he could not do the character justice in the massive scope of Chrono Cross. While Radical Dreamers characters were used as a base for the characters of Chrono Cross, Kato made changes as well. In Radical Dreamers, Serge acted as the game's narrator, rather than a silent protagonist, and Lynx, is just a regular human, rather than an anthropomorphic cat. With the release of Chrono Cross, the characters and events of Radical Dreamers were retconned as being from a similar but different alternate reality. Conception Once work on the actual Chrono Cross started, the initial vision beyond character recruitment was even more expansive. The game initially was intended to be able to have the player recruit any person they encountered, through either interacting or battling them. However, eventually the development team found this to be too ambitious, and narrowed it down to 64 playable characters, and then again down to 45 characters for the final game, which were then drawn by character designer Nobuteru Y≈´ki. The backgrounds of some minor characters were left to members of the staff. The development team also considered the idea of having each character have their own ending, each with three variant scenarios based on events occurred in the game, leading to over 120 endings, but the idea was scrapped as being not feasible. Parallel dimensions The developers of Chrono Cross created a setting consisting of two parallel dimensions; the \\"Home World\\", where the game starts, and the \\"Alternate World\\", that is introduced shortly afterwards. The two worlds are used to illustrate the concept of the butterfly effect; both worlds have the same basic make-up, but show key differences that have resulted from one minor difference; the main character, Serge, died years ago in the \\"Alternate World\\". Some effects are direct, such as his mother no longer living in his home village, or that people he knew in the \\"Home World\\" no longer recognizing him in the \\"Alternate World\\". Others are far more indirect, with his absence leading other characters to make different decisions in their lives, effecting whether they end up being rich or poor, or follow their dreams or gives up on them. As such, there are sometimes two very different versions of characters, or conversely, characters who are only present in one world or another, due to dying or leaving the game's setting due to events happening in only one world. The development team conceded it was difficult for even them to keep track of all of the game's characters, with complications arising in keeping all the relationships and events straight across so many characters and two parallel dimensions. Accent system A vast majority of the 45 characters in the game possess their own unique accents and speech patterns. When lines were being recycled for a number of characters, instead of storing over 40 slightly different static variations of the same text and running into potential memory issues, the localization team adapted and expanded the Japanese version's auto-accent generator, to allow text to be converted into a dozen of variations that retain most of the features of the various characters. With this system, only one generic version had to be stored internally and shared by all characters. For example, the static text \\"How are you?\\" would be stored, but if spoken by an Australian character it would be changed to \\"How are ya?\\"; if spoken by an Alien character it would appear as \\"How aare yoou?\\" Translator Richard Honeywood would say in retrospect that while the converter helped deal with memory constraints, creating and working with it was described as \\"mind- boggling\\". The system did not work well with some more detailed scenes that required more context; these were treated as independent lines, retaining an original version of the dialogue for each character. Characters=Playable characters The game contains a total of 45 playable characters. While some join automatically as the plot progresses, others only become playable depending on the actions of the player. For example, early in the game, the player is tasked with breaking Serge into a heavily guarded manor.Chrono Cross, Termina, Kid: Alright, that's settled! We've gotta sneak into Viper Manor. The player must explore the town outside of the manor in order to find assistance with breaking in.Chrono Cross, Termina, Kid: According to grandpa here, this Viper Manor's a bloody large place, which also means it'll be easy to break into! There's gotta be more than one way in. If we don't plan this right, it'll cost us our lives. The player may choose to ask Guile, Pierre, or Nikki for help on different approaches to breaking into the manor. The player may only choose one, and only that respective character will join the party. At other times, characters will not join if other characters are present. Early in the game, Leena will only join if the player opts to have Serge traveling alone at the time; if Kid is already with him, she no longer feels the need to help, and will not join. As such, it is impossible for all characters to join over the course of a single game. However, the game employs a New Game + system, where, upon starting a second game, characters who had been recruited on the prior play through will become available towards the latter part of the game. As such, the player can retain characters from the first game, while taking alternate paths to recruit characters missed the first time. The characters are presented in the order given in the game's master list of playable characters. =Serge= is the silent protagonist of Chrono Cross; his motions alongside the reactions of other players indicate that Serge talks with others, but none of Serge's actual dialogue is shown outside of occasional dialogue trees. Instead, he is meant to be interpreted as \\"the persona of the player\\".Chrono Cross Game Manual, pg 6-7 Much of the game involves the player following Serge after he's been sucked into an alternative dimension where no one he previously know recognizes him, and many are in his pursuit. The game's events reveal that Serge had died years prior in the Alternate World. As a child, he had come in contact with the all-powerful \\"Frozen Flame\\", a remnant of the all-powerful Lavos creature from Chrono Trigger. Once Serge had made contact, it sealed off the ability for anyone else to gain access to its power. With Serge dead in the \\"Alternate World\\", the Serge alive in the Home World Serge was now necessary in the Alternate World.Chrono Cross, Viper Manor, Prophet: ...in this world, you are the missing piece from a giant puzzle. And maybe, just maybe...the vacuum created by your non-existence here has drawn you across the border between the dimensions to fill the void in that puzzle. Kid, pulled him through the dimensions as part of Balthasar's lengthy plan to defeat the Time Devourer and free Schala from it. Meanwhile, Lynx needed his body in order to gain access to the Frozen Flame's power. While Lynx succeeds in this, resulting in the two switching bodies for a period of the game, leaving the player controlling Serge trapped in Lynx's body for the middle third of the game, if the player directs Serge to find the legendary \\"Chrono Cross\\" item and use it to fight the Time Devourer, Balthasar's plan also succeeds. =Lynx= is an anthropomorphic feline that serves as one of the game's primary antagonists. Initially, he is seen as a character that is searching for Serge with the Acacia Dragoons, and loathed by Kid, both for then unknown reasons. For the middle portion of the game, Lynx switches bodies with Serge, where he is the primary playable character for a third of the game. It's eventually revealed that, due to a complicated series of events, Lynx is actually Serge's father, taken over by a supercomputer named FATE, that ultimately needed Serge's body to access the all-powerful Frozen Flame. In addition to this, Kid's hate stems from Lynx's past abduction of Lucca Ashtear, Kid's maternal figure from her orphanage, who had stood in the way of his goals.Chrono Cross - Water Dragon Isle, Kid: I was an orphan...I was abandoned when I was a baby... There was someone [Lucca] who took me in and raised me as if I were her own little sister...I'm alive here today thanks to her. There were a lot of others like me at Sis's place...Up until that Lynx bastard...came and shattered our happiness to pieces! Lynx raided our house, burned it down, and kidnapped Sis! Lynx does not have a particular speech pattern, and is silent when Serge is inhabiting his body. All of the game's events depict the \\"Alternate World\\" Lynx; the \\"Home World\\" Lynx is not ever seen. Kato, in the Ultimania guide, states that in the Home World, Lynx dies in the Dead Sea with Harle and the Acacia Dragoons. =Kid= is the deuteragonist of the game. Kid loathes Lynx for initially undisclosed reasons, and helps to defend Serge from Lynx's pursuit efforts against him. While they team up due to shared involvement with Lynx, various choices by the player and certain required plot points shorten or lengthen the time they work together. Late in the game, it is revealed that she is actually a cloned version of Schala from Chrono Trigger, who had fallen into an area beyond time and space following the events of the prior game. There, she was trapped and fused with Lavos, the antagonist of Chrono Trigger, but was still able to observe the rest of the world. Schala observed Serge about to drown as a child, created the storm that saved his life by directing him to the healing powers of the Frozen Flame, and then created a clone of herself to send back to reality to find Serge. The clone-baby, Kid, is found by Lucca, who raises her in her orphanage. Kid hates Lynx because he raided Lucca's orphanage, abducting Lucca and leaving Kid homeless, leaving her to fend for herself as a child on her own, leading to the brash exterior person she is for much of the course of the game. Kid is also the reason why there are two dimensions in the game; she traveled in time to save Serge from dying, splitting the world into two, one where Serge lives, and one where he had died. She speaks with an Australian accent, as indicated by her use of several Australian slang terms such as bugger, bloke, and sheila. The Alternate World Kid is the one seen throughout the game; Kato stated that a Home World version of Kid exists, but is located outside the scope of the game's setting, and never comes across the game's events. =Guile= is a traveling magician who makes a bet with a fortune- teller that he could break into Viper Manor. The player, who must break Serge into Viper Manor as well, may choose to work with Guile, leading him to join the party if selected. Early in the game's development, Guile was intended to be the character Magus from Chrono Trigger, who after the events of the first game, was traveling through time to find his lost sister, Schala. However, as development progressed, upon adding such a large cast of characters to the game, the development team felt that his story couldn't sufficiently be focused on, and he was switched into the Guile character. The developers still left some subtle references to Magus; including his Japanese name, Alf, resembling Magus's cats name, Alfador in Chrono Trigger, his English name, Guile, being similar to \\"Gil\\", the name for Magus in Radical Dreamers, and similarities to Magus in his appearance and \\"floating\\" nature of movement. Guile's speech often references topics such as \\"mystery\\" or \\"magic\\". He is only shown in the \\"Alternate World\\". While he does not appear in the \\"Home World\\", Sneff recognizes the \\"Alternate World\\" Guile as part of the \\"Magic Guild\\", suggesting he had seen the \\"Home World\\" Guile. =Norris= is the leader of the \\"Black Wind\\", an elite branch of the Porre Military.Chrono Cross In-game character database, \\"Black Wind Leader\\" In the \\"Home World\\", they have overtaken the town of Termina, where General Viper and the Acacia Dragoons cease to exist, and as such, are unable to defend the town from them.Porre Soldier: Why Commander Norris. Thank you for your trouble. Currently, we have suspended all economic activities in Termina. He automatically joins the party to help Serge while trapped in Lynx's body, desiring to accompany him to the Dead Sea, and ends up stays with the group. Norris doesn't speak with any special accent or habits, but generally speaks and acts very kindly towards people, sometimes unbefitting of a person who is a leader of a military group.Porre Soldier: Commander Norris is a little too soft. I wish he'd just crack down on those El Nido hicks. In one of the game's endings, it is revealed that he is the \\"kind stranger\\" who delivered the antidote that cured Kid's life-threatening poison if the player chose to have Serge not save her.Norris:You do not like it? Then how about \\"Red Scorpion?\\" ... Kid: Alright, fine...I'll do it. Ya did save me life by getting me the Hydra Humour, I'spose...\\" Norris is present in both the \\"Home World\\" and the \\"Alternate World\\", with him being largely the same in both worlds. =Nikki= is a guitarist in the \\"Magical Dreamers\\", a musical troupe of which the dancer Miki is also a member. He is the son of Fargo and his deceased wife, Zelbess, and a sibling to Marcy. In the \\"Alternate World\\", he joins the party if the player opts to have Serge work with him as one of the possible people to break into the Viper Manor. He is present in the \\"Home World\\" as well, where he is trying to cleanse the monster-infested island of Marbule. Nikki's speech pattern finds him often referencing guitars or music in general. Several allusions to Slash, including his original Japanese name, and the song lyrics he sings, such as \\"Sweet Sister of Mine\\".Nikki: \\"Ohhh oooh oooh...Sweet sister of mine..\\" He as a character is largely consistent, without any major differences, between the \\"Home\\" and \\"Alternate World\\". =Viper= General is the lord of El Nido and leader of the Acacia Dragoons. He served as one of the four former Dragoon Devas, the highest rank of the Acacia Dragoons, until he retired and became the head of El Nido.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Viper's Manor, Another World. \\"Karsh: The general is the head of the Viper clan and has governed these islands for generations. But that's not all. When he was ordered to take up a new post on the main continent, he made quite an impact as the leader of the Acacia Dragoons and was promoted to general. He has retired from the army since then and currently serves as the lord of El Nido.\\"Chrono Cross. Level/area: Hermit's Hideaway, Another World. \\"Radius: I believe General Viper intends to overthrow the nation of Porre with the power of this legendary flame. [...] Perhaps the general envisions a bright and peaceful world, much like Guardia was at one time...\\" He is also the father of Riddel.Zoah: HE WAS ENGAGED TO THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER, MISS RIDDEL... Over the course of the game, he aspires to acquire the powerful \\"Frozen Flame\\" to defend El Nido from the militaristic nation of Porre and create a peaceful world similar to the kingdom of Guardia. He automatically join's Serge party. Viper has a formal and diplomatic speech pattern.Viper: Let's work out a deal. Release my daughter, and I shall let you walk away. How about it? While usually a confident father figure type, he has moments of uncertainty as well, referring to himself as \\"\\"just a fool chasing his own desires\\".Chrono Cross. Level/area: Termina, Another World. \\"Viper: ...... I must have been fooling myself. Pretending I was a good lord... I am not worthy of being honoured with such a large statue. I am just a fool chasing his own desires.\\" Viper is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\"; in the \\"Home World\\", he and his men are persuaded by Lynx to visit the Dead Sea three years prior to the game, and all end up dead. =Riddel= is the daughter of General Viper and past fianc√© to childhood friend Dario prior to his death in the \\"Alternate World\\".Chrono Cross. Level/area: Viper's Manor, Another World. \\"Zoah: OUR LEADER, DARIO, DIED IN AN ACCIDENT 3 YEARS AGO... HE WIELDED THE HOLY SWORD, EINLANZER, AND WAS A TRUSTED CONFIDANT OF GENERAL Viper. HE WAS ENGAGED TO THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER, MISS Riddel, AND WAS NEXT IN LINE TO BECOME THE HEAD OF THE VIPER CLAN.\\"Chrono Cross. Level/area: Viper's Manor, Another World. \\"Acacia Dragoon: It's been 3 years since Sir Dario's death... Miss Riddel has been heavy-hearted since...\\" Riddel automatically joins Serge's party after being rescued by him from Porre soldiers. If the player opts to have Serge travel to the \\"Home World\\" with Riddel to an isolated island, they find that Dario is indeed alive in the \\"Home World\\". If the player has Serge fight and defeat Dario, Riddel decides to help him rebuild the destroyed Viper's Manor and make it an orphanage.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Viper's Manor, Home World. \\"Riddel: We have to bear in mind that children will be living here. Why not officially make this place into an orphanage?\\" Riddel doesn't have a specific speech pattern, but commonly speaks as a kind and beautiful woman with a heavy heart.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Termina, Another World. \\"Woman: I saw Miss Riddel visiting the shrines again. She made a darling couple with her childhood sweetheart, Dario. It's such a pity that he died so young... They say beautiful women rarely find happiness...\\" Riddel is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\", in the \\"Home World\\", she and the rest of the Acacia Dragoons die in the Dead Sea. =Karsh= is one of the four Dragoon Devas. Initially, he is merely shown as a figure Lynx uses to track down Serge, though he later joins the party during Serge's body switch with Lynx. As a child, Karsh feels jealousy over Riddel's romantic feelings towards his friend Dario, and later regret for killing Dario, though its later revealed he killed Dario out a self-defense while he was possessed, not jealousy. He is portrayed as rough but honorable.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Viper's Manor, Another World. \\"Zippa: His name is Karsh. He's a pretty rough character, but he's a good boy.\\" During development, a design of Karsh wearing full armor was rejected for not fitting the game's atmosphere. Karsh is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\", in the \\"Home World\\", he and the rest of the Acacia Dragoons die in the Dead Sea. =Zoah= is one of the four Dragoon Devas. He constantly wears an iron helmet to cover his face due to a war injury. He rejects wealth and power and has chosen to dedicate his life to battle,Chrono Cross. Level/area: Terra Tower. \\"Zoah: HMPH! WHAT MEANING IS THERE TO A LIFE OF STRIVING AFTER WEALTH AND POWER...? IT IS NO USE TO YOU ONCE YOU DIE! AS FOR ME, I CHOOSE TO LIVE IN BATTLE AND ONE DAY TO DIE IN BATTLE.\\" although the fortune teller in Termina senses \\"deep sadness\\" beneath his helmet.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Termina, Another World. \\"I sense deep sadness beneath that mask of yours... During development, Zoah was meant to be \\"the prince of a certain country\\", watching over the protagonists' actions and wearing the helmet not due to an injury but to hide his true identity. However, because of time constraints, the event hinting at this was not implemented. Zoah's dialogue is written in all capital letters to emulate his voice booming through the helmet. Zoah is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\", in the \\"Home World\\", he and the rest of the Acacia Dragoons die in the Dead Sea. =Marcy= is one of the four Dragoon Devas. Her appearance is of a human, though she is the daughter of Fargo, a human, and Zelbess, a demi-human, her ancestry something she struggles with internally.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Terra Tower. \\"Marcy:...I know that half of the blood within me is that of a demi-human... And I know that it'll be easier for me if I can accept that fact... She largely grows up without her family - Zelbess dies right after her birth, and Fargo believed Marcy to have died as well - but lives with the assistance from the Dragoons and Luccia, a friend of Zelbess.Chrono Cross. Level/area: SS Zelbess, Home World. \\"Irenes: Luccia tried to s√§ve my sister Zelbess... But she was √∂nly √§ble to s√§ve the b√§by... Marcy... Luccia felt resp√∂nsible and has supp√∂rted Marcy from a dist√§nce through√∂ut her life.\\" Her original name during development was Rachel. Marcy's speech pattern sounds like an angry valley girl, often yelling at others while adding \\"like\\" through her fiery statements. Marcy is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\", in the \\"Home World\\", she and the rest of the Acacia Dragoons die in the Dead Sea. =Korcha= is a troublemaker in the town of Termina, but when Kid is poisoned, he is there to rescue her as she falls from a Viper Manor balcony. He becomes enamored with Kid, and helps Serge find the Hydra Humour needed to cure her. =Luccia= is a scientist who conducts experiments in Viper Mansion. Her experiments create playable characters Pip and NioFio, while her brother created Grobyc. If the player chooses to have Serge speak to her late in the game, she joins the party, wanting to observe Serge's strength, and if the player has Kid speak with her reveals she was scientific colleagues with Lucca from Chrono Trigger. Luccia speaks with a German accent.Luccia: \\"Oh... Pip? It is an evolving monster. It vill change its form as it battles.\\" She is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\"; the Viper Manor she resides in is destroyed in the \\"Home World\\". =Poshul= is a pink dog belonging to Leena. She speaks with a lisp, a stutter, many exclamations, and commonly using \\"I\\" and \\"me\\" interchangeably.Poshul: AHHH! I-I-Ith that...a Heckran bone!? Serge!? A p-p- prethent!? F-F-For I!? How'd you know? Hmm... To acthept, or not to acthept? AHEM! Me acthept your prethent and Me shall help you! Poshul is identical in both the \\"Home World\\" and \\"Alternate World\\", and the only character that can have either version of the character join the party, merely requiring the player to have Serge give her a bone. =Razzly= is a fairy from Water Dragon Isle. If the player opts to have Serge help find a cure for Kid's poison, it leads him to the Hydra Marshes, where Razzly is imprisoned and surrounded by a deadly monster. If the player has Serge intervene to save her, she joins the party; if the player does not save her, or decides against assisting Kid altogether, Razzly is never seen again, with only her mangled cage remaining. When Razzly speaks, she replaces the words \\"fairly\\" and \\"very\\" with the word \\"fairy\\".Chrono Cross: Razzly: Tee-hee! We are fairy, fairy strong! Razzly is only present in the \\"Home World\\"; in the \\"Alternate World\\", her events occur because the Water Dragon Isle is dried up and abandoned, and the Hydra Marshes are poisoned. =Zappa= is a blacksmith from the town of Termina, and had been one of the four Devas of the Acacia Dragoons prior to the events of the game. He is the husband of Zippa, and father of Karsh, who has succeeded him as one of General Viper's 4 Dragoon Devas. Zappa has a Scottish accent. He is present in both the \\"Home World\\" and \\"Alternate World\\", though very different in each one. In the \\"Alternate World\\", he is seen as a thriving blacksmith, providing equipment to the Acacia Dragoons. However, in the \\"Home World\\", his business struggles and has to shut it down, due to the Acacia Dragoons being completely wiped out and because of the Porre military restricting his business. Additionally, in the \\"Home World\\", he is saddened because Karsh has been missing for the last three years. As such, if the player has Serge talk with Zappa in the \\"Home World\\", he will join the party, in order to search the world for Karsh and improve his craft. =Orcha= is the cook at Viper Manor. The Porre Military made him ingest Quaffid seeds, and then transformed him into the Hell's Cook to have him torture Riddel, but he is defeated by Serge, when he arrives in Lynx's body. He reverts to normal, and joins forces with Serge. Similar to Korcha, Macha, and Mel, Orcha commonly substitutes \\"cha\\" in for you, for instance, saying \\"Dontcha?\\" in place of \\"Don't you?\\". Despite his similar name and speaking patterns, none of their interactions indicate Orcha even knowing the rest of them. =Radius= is a skilled, knowledgeable, and retired warrior.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Arni, Home World. \\"Woman: I did everything just as Chief Radius told me. And now, the aches in my body are completely gone! What a fine man our chief is. Skilled, competent, caring... I heard he was quite a warrior in his prime. You could learn much from our chief and grow up to be a great man like Radius.\\" Prior to his retirement, he served as one of the Dragoon Devas, where he and his friend Garai eventually found the cursed Masamune sword. This resulted in Radius assassinating Garai in a fit of jealousy partly induced by the cursed sword. Radius discarded the sword and kept the cause of death to himself, retiring from fighting to look after Garai's sons, Dario and Glenn, until Dario became a Dragoon Deva. Radius's speech often references his old age or other's comparative younger age, and is accompanied by an old man's laugh.Chrono Cross, Battle Tutorial, Radius: First, here's some basic advice on attacking, so listen up young'un...Hoh-hoh-hoh! You're not even close! Don't be trusting in your HIT% too much there, boy! In the Home World, Radius becomes the village chief of Serge's hometown - Arni, while in the Alternate World, Radius left the world's affairs entirely to live as a hermit. =Fargo= is the captain of the S.S. Zelbess and Nikki and Marcy's father. In Another World, he captains a pirate ship, the S.S. Invincible. Serge stumbles across the ship in the fog south of Hermit's Hideaway and, once aboard, is challenged by Fargo to various tests of strength. In Home World, Fargo is the captain of a cruise ship, the S.S. Zelbess, and is a cheater in his own casino. Fargo exudes a very \\"macho\\" persona, and occasionally speaks with pirate dialog. Formerly a Dragoon Deva along with Radius, Garai, and Zappa. =Macha= is the mother of Korcha and Mel residing in Guldove. If the player chooses to have Serge not help Kid when poisoned, Korcha refuses to join the party and Macha joins instead. Like her children, she commonly subs in \\"cha\\" for \\"you\\" in her sentence, saying \\"dontcha\\" in place of \\"don't you\\". =Glenn= is a member of the Acacia Dragoons. Glenn was created by the developers to represent a unique situation in JRPGs - a \\"zealous hero\\" type who was not actually the main character or central focus of the story. He bears the same name as the character nicknamed Frog from Chrono Trigger, but has no apparent connection to him. Originally considered a naughty child, after the death of his father Garai and brother Dario, he matures, becomes popular among the townsfolk, and joins the military.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Termina, Another World. \\"Woman: That boy is dear, sweet Glenn, a member of the Acacia Dragoons. Pretty popular with the people here. But it really surprises me to see that naughty little boy grown so mature...\\" He doesn't have a specific speech pattern, but often speaks showing that he follows his own moral sense and is even willing to break military regulations if deemed necessary, being one of the few who is suspicious of Lynx early in the game.Chrono Cross. Level/area: Termina, Another World. \\"Woman: ...If worse comes to worst, you might be discharged from the Acacia Dragoons. Glenn: Yes. I will act in accordance with my faith, even if I have to break military regulations. I must go.\\" Glenn is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\", in the \\"Home World\\", he and the rest of the Acacia Dragoons die in the Dead Sea. =Leena= is the close childhood friend of Serge who lives in the town of Arni. While no romantic relationship between her and Serge is ever explicitly stated, she does ask him for jewelry, refers to long-term promises made between them in the past,Chrono Cross. Level/area: Opassa Beach, Home World. \\"Leena: So, Serge, you haven't forgotten about the promise we made that day!? Hehee...... That makes me... happy.\\" and asks about the prospect of them kissing one another.Leena: So tell me, Serge. How's it going with the me in this world? Have we kissed yet? While typically being a sweet, girl next door type around Serge, her brother Una claims she is prone to temper tantrums and not being very \\"lady-like\\".Chrono Cross. Level/area: Arni, Another World. \\"Una: Yeah, my sister still needs to work on her temper... She has those temper tantrums, you know... You get a slap in the face before she even opens her mouth. I'm sure if she gets herself a boyfriend, she'll act a little more ladylike...\\" The only difference between the \\"Home World\\" and the \\"Alternate World\\" Leena is her relationship with Serge; Home World Leena has had a close relationship with Serge her whole life, while the other doesn't even recognize Serge, not having seen him for ten years due to his death occurring in that world.Leena: You really are Serge, aren't you...? You're alive in this world, living a normal life with me. But in the other world, ...you're dead...And I'm living a different life without you... It is actually Alternate World Leena who follows Serge for much of the game; the Home World Leena only initiates the search for jewelry that set the events of the entire game in motion, otherwise staying behind. The Alternate World Leena joins Serge if the player chooses to reject Kid's first offer to travel with Serge early in the game, Leena not chasing after him if another girl is with him already. =Miki= is a famous dancer known throughout El Nido. In the Alternate World, she is on tour with Nikki, while in the Home World, she is a performer aboard the S.S. Zelbess cruise ship. She joins the party if the player chooses to have Serge assist Miki and Nikki in saving the monster-overrun island of Marbule. =Harle= is a harlequin jester. Harle works with Lynx against Serge and his party, as a gadfly who interferes with their efforts and frustrates Kid due to her constant flirting with Serge. She joins the party during Serge's body switch with Lynx, and leaves just before Serge returns to his body. It's eventually revealed that she was the \\"Dark Moon Dragon\\", actually working against Lynx to obtain the powerful Frozen Flame to exact havoc against humanity damaging activities to the planet. She fails in her mission, and her ultimate fate is left unclear. The game mentions, and Kato confirms in the game's Ultimania Guide, that Harle also shares a connection of sorts to Schala, though neither source explores the details of this. Harle's speech is written with a French accent and is often interspersed with French words.Chrono Cross, Demo Loop, Harle: Serge, mon ami! Your humain world iz about to end! Only one version of Harle, the \\"Alternate World\\" Harle, is present in the game. =Janice= is a female human and rabbit hybrid aboard the S.S. Zelbess. If the player chooses to have Serge participate in the monster battling tournament, and defeat her three times, she joins the party. =Draggy= is a baby dragon. If the player chooses to have Serge hatch the egg from Fossil Valley in the incubator at Ft. Dragonia in the Home World, Draggy emerges from the egg and joins the party. As such, his dialogue mimics a child's speech patter, for example, replacing an \\"r\\" with a \\"w\\" to refer to himself as a \\"Dwagon\\". =Starky= initially appears as \\"Mega-Starky\\", a huge alien, that Serge must fight when arriving on Home World Sky Dragon Isle in the Home World. Once defeated, he shrinks down to normal size. Starky's main goal is to collect \\"Star Fragments\\", which he explains to be broken parts of his spaceship that shattered upon contact with the planet. He joins the party to collect all of the Star Fragments, but upon traveling to Another World, he discovers the spaceship completely intact in that dimension. From the spaceship he retrieves an anti-gravity device allows the party to reach Terra Tower in the sky, which had been otherwise unreachable. =Sprigg= is a resident of the Dimensional Vortex, where Serge is sent after trading bodies with Lynx. She helps him escape back to reality, and automatically joins the party. Sprigg's unique ability is \\"Doppelgang\\", which allows her to transform into certain monsters defeated by her. =Mojo= is a human-sized voodoo doll purchased by a resident of Serge's hometown, Arni Village. If the player chooses to have Serge interact with it, it gains sentience and the ability to move, and joins Serge's party. While initially distraught upon learning that voodoo dolls are used to inflict pain upon others, he decides to use his newfound self-awareness to help spread happiness to others instead, taking on the new name , a play on \\"more joy\\". His speech pattern commonly adds an extraneous \\"-om\\" suffix to words.Chrono Cross, Final boss gate, Mojoy:...Soo this must be-om the final gate to the darkness of time...Accept- om my love and courage! He is only present in the Alternate World; he is never purchased by Arni resident in the Home World. =Turnip= is first discovered growing in the ground outside of the Hermit's Hideaway after if the player chooses to cool the ground in the area. Upon freeing him, he joins the party. His speech patter adds an extraneous \\"-eth\\" suffix to various words he says.Chrono Cross, Final boss gate, Turnip: This must be-eth the final gate to the darkness of time! I shall fight-eth... =NeoFio= is a half plant, half human hybrid created as a result of one of Luccia's experiments.Luccia: \\" Dis Homosap flower is called '\\"NeoFio.\\"' As it matures, it vill behave just like a human... Naturally, it vas I vho improved it.\\" It is created and joins the party if the player chooses to have Serge follow Luccia's request to retrieve a \\"Life Sparkle\\".Luccia: \\"One is able to train it if it blossoms. But a '\\"Life Sparkle\\"' is necessary for dat.\\" NeoFio speaks normally except for substituting a \\"ph\\" for every \\"f\\" in all words, a play on pH having such importance in soil pH and plants, and that \\"f\\" and \\"ph\\" phonetically make the same sound.NeoFio:\\" The time has phinally come. We must phight phor the next generation! He does not exist in the \\"Home World\\", where Luccia, his creator, is not present due to Viper Manor's destruction. =Greco= is a former luchador wrestler who performs funeral services on the outskirts of Termina. The death of his best friend in an accident caused him to stop wrestling. If the player has Serge talk to him after one of his services, he joins the party. Elements of the Spanish language are mixed in with his dialogue. Greco is only present in the \\"Alternate World\\", although the ghost of Ghetz does show up and recognize Greco, suggesting Greco existing there as well. Greco was based on an actual real-life lucha libre wrestler and a catholic priest that goes by the stage name Fray Tormenta, the lucha mask Greco wears heavily resembles Fray Tormenta's original design (but the main color is different to avoid possible legal issues). =Skelly= is a skeleton clown whose bones are scattered around the El Nido archipelago. His origins trace back to a boy who ran off to join the circus, but eventually died while working there. If the player opts to have Serge locate his five main bones, and has him talk to his grandmother, he will join Serge's party. =Funguy= is the father of Leena's friend Lisa, who runs the element shop in Termina. While initially a normal human, if the player chooses to have Serge feed him the \\"strange mushroom\\" item, it turns him into a mushroom-like humanoid creature. Blaming Serge for his condition, he joins the party in hopes of finding a cure. A cure is never found, but Funguy comes to terms with his new appearance, and decides to live his life in the forest by the end of the events of the game.Funguy: Well, I guess it's time for me to head back to the forest. You know, I really don't mind the way I look anymore. So don't worry about it. His counterpart in the Home world, falls mysteriously ill around the time Funguy transformed. =Irenes= is a mermaid from the town of Marbule. However, she, and the rest of the demi-human citizens of the town, are driven out by monsters and forced to hard work on Fargo's cruise ship. She yearns to return her people to their land, and joins the party if the player chooses to have Serge help restore the town so they can return home. Irenes's speech pattern involves her vowels having umlauts. She is only present in the \\"Home World\\"; as the Marbule conflict does not occur in the Alternate World, she never appears. =Mel= is Korcha's adopted little sister, and she is known for doodling with her crayons and having little to do with anyone around her. When Kid recovers from her poisoning at the hands of Lynx, Mel steals her elements during the night, but leaves behind evidence indicating that she is the thief. Korcha outsmarts Mel, and with Serge's help, surrounds her, and she is forced to return Kid's elements to her. =Leah= is an orphan child living on the isolated island known as Gaea's Navel. She is the daughter of an unnamed warrior who disappeared \\"to the sky\\" when she was very young.Leah: You know-um father? Father is-um brave warrior. Leah lose-um father when Leah very little. Grandma say-um father went-um to sky. She helps Serge find the Green Dragon, and joins the party upon defeating him, desiring to travel the world to help her decide if she wants return to her village or not, and to see if she can find out what happened to her father.Leah: Maybe Leah find-um father if Leah come-um. Also, Leah need decide-um something. Leah decide-um right, Leah return-um to village. Leah's appearance and speech is similar to Ayla from Chrono Trigger, such as the tendency to add the suffix -um to some words in her speech, or using the phrase \\"Oooga Booga\\". Upon the end of the game, Leah states that she will name her daughter Ayla as well.Leah: Leah already have-um name for Leah's child. Big, strong name. Aylaaaaaa!!! New song of land! Bye, Serge. Oooga- Booga! She is only portrayed in the \\"Home World\\", as riding a creature called a \\"Wingapede\\" is the only method to traveling to Gaea's Navel, and the Hydra Marshes from which a \\"Wingapede\\" come from are raided and poisoned in the \\"Alternate World\\". =Van= is a child living with his father, Gogh, in the town of Termina; their names referencing the Vincent Van Gogh in the real world. Van is never happy with his father, though the reasons vary between the two worlds. In the \\"Home World\\", Gogh follows his dreams and becomes a painter, which leaves Van living in poverty and in fear of eviction, while in the \\"Alternate World\\", Gogh gives up his passion in favor of the more lucrative business trading of paintings, leaving Van living more comfortably, but feeling neglected due to Gogh's focus on career. If the player directs Serge to Van, he joins up, hoping Serge's adventure will lead him to solutions to his issues. Van does not have a particular speech pattern, but commonly references aspect of painting or art in his dialogue. =Sneff= is a performance magician indentured to Fargo in the Home World, due to his gambling debt to the captain. However, this is due to a rigged setup that causes Fargo to win every time. Upon Serge removing a part from Fargo's cheating device, rendering it inoperable, Sneff is able to earn back his freedom, and proceeds to join the party. Sneff is missing his front teeth, and thus is unable to pronounce some sounds. He pronounces \\"three\\" as \\"free\\" and \\"teeth\\" as \\"teeff.\\" =Steena= is a shaman from Guldove. She assists Serge in finding the \\"Chrono Cross\\", and recovering his former body back after it was switched with Lynx's. She is known to guard the Dragon Tear in Guldove. Steena commonly speaks of prophecies, ancient lore, and spirituality in her dialogue. She is present in both the \\"Home World\\" and \\"Alternate World\\" as primarily the same person. In the \\"Alternate World\\", she still works under her elder shaman, Direa, where as in the \\"Home World\\", Direa has died, so Steena works by herself. =Doc= is the doctor of the island village of Guldove. When Kid is poisoned by Lynx's dagger, he feels remorse for being unable to provide the cure. If the player chooses not to have Serge help Kid, Doc joins the party, in hopes of broadening his world view and knowledge. Doc speaks in surfer lingo.Doc: Another world? You mean to say such a thing exists? Truly bodacious... He is present in both the \\"Home World\\" and \\"Alternate World\\", largely having the same characteristics. =Grobyc= is a cyborg, and nicknamed \\"Killing Machine\\", from the Porre Military.Porre Officer: That's right. This is the Killing Machine Grobyc. Cold and calculating, he only answers to anyone who is stronger than himself.Grobyc: Grobyc-only-takes- orders-from-those-who-are-stronger. As such, Grobyc joins Serge's party automatically, after Serge defeats both himself, and another cyborg, Guillot, while rescuing Riddell from Viper Manor.Grobyc: Grobyc-only-takes-orders-from- one-who-is-stronger. Thus-Grobyc-will-join-you-in-your-battle. Grobyc spelled backwards is \\"cyborg\\". He refers to himself in the third person, and his dialogue substitutes all spaces between words with dashes, simulating a rigid and mechanical speech pattern.Grobyc:Show-Grobyc-your-skill. Kotaku named Grobyc one of the \\"Most Insane Cyborgs In Japanese Video Games\\" in 2013. =Pierre= is a vain, conceited swordsman living in the city of Termina, who values \\"beauty\\" over work ethic.John: I'm working hard to become a future hero!!! The first step to heroism is building a good physique! Pierre: That a boy! But, the most important trait of a hero is beauty. He refers to himself as a great hero,Pierre: What is a hero like moi to do? yet is merely living in a rented room of Zappa's and unable to even pay rent on time.Zappa: Pierre...Ye still owe me last month's rent... He moved to Termina because he aspires to go to Viper Manor to meet with General Viper about being part of the \\"Acacia Dragoons\\", of which are the highest level of knights. However, he fears he won't be let in without his \\"Hero's Medal\\". Pierre is only part of the story if the player opts to have Serge use his assistance to break into Viper Manor, which involves the player locating the \\"Hero's Medal\\". Pierre's approach to breaking into the Viper Manor is merely storming the front gates, which, despite many resulting battles, does work. However, later skirmishes between Kid and Lynx, and the eventual stabbing of General Viper, prevents any of Pierre's personal goals from progressing. Pierre speaks with a French accent, though very amateurishly, and speaks in a condescending manner.Pierre: One graceful flash of mon sword will surely have them saluting moi as the guest of honor... He is only depicted in the \\"Alternate World\\"; he is not seen in the \\"Home World\\", where there is no opening in the \\"Acacia Dragoons\\", which have been entirely wiped out. =Orlha= is a resident and bartender on the island village of Guldove. She first appears in the game as the person who convinces the Doctor not to give up on saving Kid from being poisoned. Later in the game, she is seen as a protector of the island as well, defending it when the Porre invades. Serge, stuck in Lynx's body, appears to be with the Porre military, and is forced into fighting her. After the battle, Serge is able to convince the Porre soldiers to leave, saving Orlha and Guldove. Orlha, grateful but unable to trust him in his Lynx/Porre form, gives him a brooch. If the player chooses to have Serge bring the brooch to Orlha once he's back in his original body, Orlha joins the party.Orlha: ...Listen, Serge. Promise me this. When you successfully regain your true self, come visit me. I will gladly aid you then... Orlha is only shown to exist in the \\"Alternate World\\". Rather than another version of herself, she has a twin sister, Tia, who only exists in the \\"Home World\\".Doc: Tia, is that you Tia? What the...? Orlha: No, I'm not Tia...Please calm down. I am Tia's twin sister, Orlha... Doc: Tia's twin sister...? H-Hold on a sec! What exactly is going on? Orlha had been searching for her her whole life, but only finds her if she joins Serge's party and travels to the other world. She finds Tia dying, and is unable to save her, but Tia's spirit inhabits the blue brooch Serge returns to her, traveling with Orlha and even helping her attack in battle. Orlha doesn't follow a particular speech pattern, but is often shown as a \\"voice of reason\\" in serious times, and a rowdy tom boy in battle situations. =Pip= is a cute Pok√©mon-like creature that Luccia experimented on in her laboratory. If player chooses to have Serge unlock his cage, he can later be recruited aboard the S.S. Invincible.Pip - Ummm...Would you mind opening dis cage quietwy? ... Thanks! I'll make my escape later. Pip is unique, being the only character that goes through transformations depending on how the player uses him in battle. Depending on what elements are used when fighting, he may transform into lighter or darker versions of himself, with different attacks and appearances. Pip's speaking pattern involves substituting many \\"l\\" and \\"r\\" sounds with a \\"w\\", and using \\"de\\" in place of \\"the\\".Pip - My dweam is to sail de vast sea someday on a big, huge ship...Would you mind opening dis cage quietwy? He is only shown to exist in the \\"Another World\\"; in the \\"Home World\\", the lab he was experimented on, in Viper Manor, was destroyed.Norris:I had narrowed down the location to Viper Manor, but...General Viper and his men had disappeared and that the manor had been destroyed...\\"  Chrono Trigger characters A number of the major characters of Chrono Trigger play roles in Chrono Cross as well, although much of the time they are relegated to the game's backstory rather than actively participating in the events of the game. Crono, Marle, and Lucca, three of the main playable characters from Chrono Trigger, appear in Chrono Cross, but they are neither playable nor major characters. Instead, they are presented as childlike apparitions that appear at key points in the game to inform Serge of key aspects of the game's backstory. While their homeland of Guardia was aggressively overthrown by the neighboring war nation Porre, their ultimate fate is not disclosed in Chrono Cross, leaving it unclear if they are meant to be literally deceased ghost figures, or alive and transposing their likeness through other methods. Additionally, the game explains that many Lucca's actions between Trigger and Cross directly influence the scenarios for both Kid and Lynx. Robo, while not directly present in the game, is meant to be the \\"Prometheus Circuit\\" referenced in the game. Belthasar, \\"Guru of Reason\\" in the ancient Kingdom of Zeal in Chrono Trigger, returns as the ultimate mastermind behind much of the events of Chrono Cross.Chrono Cross, Location: Opassa Beach, Lucca:'\\"Project Kid\\"'...the time control project Belthasar planned out. The whole project existed to lead [Serge] to this one, special point in time! The founding of Chronopolis, the Time Crash, and the battle between FATE and the Dragon Gods...It was all coordinated so that you would get your hands on the Chrono Cross and come to this place! His elaborate plan, resulting in much of the events and backstory of the game, was all engineered by him in order to enable Serge to defeat the Time Devourer and save Schala. Non-playable antagonistsDevourer of Time= The Devourer of Time is the creature resulting from Lavos absorbing Schala. Lavos returns as the main villain, but does not appear until the end. By accident during Chrono Trigger, Schala was banished to the darkness of time, where later, the remnants of the defeated Lavos arrived and began absorbing the former princess of Zeal to create a new being. The resulting life-form ‚Äî the Time Devourer ‚Äî would have been capable of devouring all spacetime once matured. Though unknown to Serge for most of his quest, the entire events concerning the dimensions and the creation of El Nido were set in motion to empower him to defeat the Time Devourer and free Schala. Using the Chrono Cross, he accomplished this mission. In DS port of Chrono Trigger, the Devourer of Time is shown in a less advanced stage of its evolution, named the Dream Devourer. =Dragon God= The Dragon God was a biological plasma machine created by the Dragonian race that existed in an alternate universe, where the Reptites survived and became the dominant race on Earth. When the city Dinopolis was sucked into the same dimension as Chronopolis, a battle ensued. In the end, the Dragonians lost the war, their city sunk into the sea, and the Dragon God itself was splintered into six beings, which became the Dragon gods that were sealed over the islands. Some like the Sky Dragon and the Water Dragon were worshiped as deities while others receded into hiding. They used Serge and his party to destroy FATE so they could break the seal and become one again. They created Harle to ensure it, though she was reluctant. However, it was revealed that the Dragon God was absorbed by the Time Devourer long ago during its separation. =FATE= FATE is a supercomputer created by Belthasar in the distant future. It was constructed from Mother Brain, a super computer in the apocalyptic future of 2300 AD outlined in the plot of Chrono Trigger. FATE is self-aware and can act alone. An event called the \\"Time Crash\\" ends up sending it back in time, where it operates as a mechanism that subconsciously directs and brainwashes humans from performing any actions that could cause a paradox that would harm its existence. FATE operates as an unseen villain until late in the game, where it reveals its goal was to reincarnate itself into a new, real, living species. However, it is defeated by Serge and his party. =The Shaker Brothers= The Shaker Brothers, Solt and Peppor, main purpose is to act as a tutorial for the player, often showing what not to do in the game's battle system.Solt: You know you can't use an Element until you have equipped it properly! So we'll have to wait until after this battle is over before we can re-equip it and use it!......Oops! They tag along with the Acacia Dragoons and reside in the Viper Manor. If the player chooses to have Serge work with Pierre to get into Viper Manner, a third character, Ketchop, is also introduced. Their names are all related to condiments: salt and pepper shakers and ketchup. Solt speaks in a redundant manner, using phrases like \\"painfully painful\\" and \\"obviously obvious\\", where Peppor excessively uses the word \\"shake\\", in phrases like \\"Let's shake it to them!\\" or \\"Let's shake it out of here!\\" Ketchop's only words are shouted references to sauces, like \\"Tomato!\\".Peppor:This doesn't look good! We could be shaken here...! Hey! Ketchop! Why don't you shaking- well do something? Ketchop:T-T-TTOOMMAATTOO!!! The Shaker Brothers are primarily present in the \\"Alternate World\\", however, they do appear in a vastly different situation in the \\"Home World\\". While the two are not killed when the Acacia Dragoons eliminated and the Viper Mansion destroyed, the two resort to wandering the world aimlessly with amnesia.Peppor: ...It was 3 years ago when...you shook us in after you found us wandering around with amnesia... Sneff takes them in as part of his traveling magic show aboard the S.S. Zelbess, albeit as struggling comedians.Solt: We are greatly grateful to you...!!! We still have a ways to go with our stand up comedy act... Reception While Chrono Cross on a whole generally received very positive reviews, including some publications, like GameSpot, giving it a perfect score, critics were divided on how Squaresoft handled the game's cast. David Zdyrko of IGN strongly praised the game's character accent system, stating he was impressed that \\"Square was able to give each of the game's 40-plus playable characters different characteristics and, in many cases, distinct accents and speech patterns. The accents were handled surprisingly well and most were pretty consistent throughout the entire game.\\" Zdyrko felt that the accent system helped validate the choice to make the cast so big, concluding that the accents \\"...combined with the fact that each of the characters in the game plays an important role in the plot of the story help brings them to life as individuals. The character development isn't the best you'll find in an RPG, but it's better than most.\\" GameSpot's Andrew Vestral similarly praised the cast, stating, \\"Surprisingly, Chrono Cross seemingly endless supply of characters works to its benefit, not its detriment...Every last one of the 40-plus members is a unique, story-driven, and valuable contributor. Unlike many cast-of-thousands RPG epics, each character in Chrono Cross is an interesting and worthy addition to your team. Everyone has a beautiful character model, excellently animated attacks, and three unique \\"limit break\\" type special skills. There's even a miniquest or special requirement for every character's best skill...you'll never add someone to your party and wonder, \\"Why is this character in the game?\\" There are no disposable placeholders in Chrono Cross.\\" Vestral did concede that much of the Chrono Trigger fan-base disapproved of the concept of 40+ characters prior to release, but he argued the way the game handled should dispel any such concerns. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution also acknowledged the concerns with the large cast as well, but felt that players would see more value in the characters once their respective dedicated sidequests were played. The staff review at RPGFan also praised the cast, not only for its size and character development, but for the unique scenario of allowing the player to recruit some characters, and then have them interact with alternate versions of themselves due to the game's alternate dimension scenario. Similarly, in a Kotaku retrospective on the game by Peter Tieryas, he stated that he initially \\"didn‚Äôt feel the characters were as rich or interesting as the ones in Chrono Trigger\\", he grew more positive of the cast upon realizing that \\"Cross wasn‚Äôt trying to recreate the closer, more intimate adventure of Trigger. Cross was about a huge cast of characters and the implications of their existence, how one death, or life, impacts the universe around them.\\" Some reviewers were less enthusiastic in regards to the game's cast of characters. USGamer's Jeremy Parish, in his Chrono Cross retrospective, felt that the creators were needlessly harsh in their treatment and uncertain fates of returning Chrono Trigger characters, a sentiment also echoed by Tieryas. Furthermore, Parish criticized the size and quality of the cast, comparing it to a failed attempt to mimic Pok√©mon or Suikoden's large casts. He concluded that too many of the characters didn't impact the game enough, stating, \\"The characters are the definition of slight ‚Äì most of them have little personality outside of a hokey accent ‚Äì but the core cast has purpose, while everyone else is there in case you want to have a giant voodoo doll, mushroom man, or baby alien in your party for some reason. Simon Seamann of RPGamer also criticized the difficulty in switching characters and transferring equipment between them, which he felt discouraged players from experiencing the full-breadth of the varied cast. Lack of character development outside of the core, required cast of characters was also cited as a problem. Leigh Alexander, in a separate retrospective from Kotaku, had a different interpretation of the cast altogether, claiming that while some characters weren't important or interesting, in a way, that was the point, and that still helped the overall narrative. She stated \\"Chrono Cross is special. That it contains so many disparate and seemingly-random recruitable party members ‚Äì though a few are key to the story ‚Äì seems to be considered by gamers to be a weakness of the game, but narratively it's effective, enhancing the player's empathy for Serge's isolation. Each person has his or her own goals; the game contains no grand messages on love and friendship and unity. It isn't particularly directed, either, with rewards sometimes to be found for simply exploring areas on one's own. It's easy to forget one's objective, to feel lost. The result is the game feels like an essay on self-discovery, a process that is inherently lonely and often sad.\\" GamesRadar particularly singled out the body-switching event between Serge and Lynx as one of their \\"Gaming's Most Satisfying Character Switches\\", with David Roberts praising the game in how it handled how differently characters interact with the player depending on the body being controlled at the time. The switch and its after-effects were also singled out by Tieryas as a standout moment, praising how the change in perspective shook up the game flow with Serge having to deal with the aftermath of Lynx's harsh prior actions to people, favorably comparing it to the film Face/Off. Other journalists found Kid to be more of a standout character. Trent Steely of RPGamer selected her as his pick for outstanding female character in RPGs, stating that \\"Kid deserves to be appreciated for her innate attributes. She truly cares for those around her, in spite of her rough edge and disdain towards authority. She also exhibits great strength and often pushes people to do the right thing. It's for those reasons why Kid deserves to be recognized as one of the better female RPG characters of our time. Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer deemed her his favorite character out of the 45 person cast, praising the stark contrast between her pleasant exterior and her difficult past of growing up homeless and living a difficult life, comparing her similarly to Aerith from Final Fantasy VII as being a character that the player would bond with and be disappointed when story events take her out of the player's party.

C√∂ln, first of her class, was launched on 5 October 1916 at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg and completed over a year later in January 1918. She and her sister were the last two light cruisers built by the Kaiserliche Marine; eight of her sisters were scrapped before they could be completed. The ships were an incremental improvement over the preceding cruisers. C√∂ln was commissioned into service with the High Seas Fleet ten months before the end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited and she did not see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. C√∂ln was to have participated in a climactic sortie in the final days of the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Unlike many of the other ships scuttled there, C√∂ln was never raised for scrapping. Design C√∂ln was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of steam turbines, which drove a pair of screw propellers. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired and six oil-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. The boilers were ducted into three funnels amidships. Her engines were rated to produce for a top speed of and a range of approximately at . Her crew consisted of 17 officers and 542 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, p. 114 The ship was armed with eight SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were arranged in a super firing pair aft.Gardiner & Gray, p. 162 These guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to .Gardiner & Gray, p. 140 They were supplied with 1,040 rounds of ammunition, for 130 shells per gun. C√∂ln also carried three 8.8 cm SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns mounted on the centerline astern of the funnels, though one was removed in 1918. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes in deck-mounted swivel launchers amidships. She also carried 200 mines. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships. The conning tower had thick sides, and the armor deck was covered with 60 mm thick armor plate. Service history C√∂ln was ordered under the contract name \\"Ersatz \\" and was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1915. She was launched on 5 October 1916, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 17 January 1918. After their commissioning under the command of Erich Raeder (17 January 1918 ‚Äì October 1918), C√∂ln and Dresden joined the High Seas Fleet.Hildebrand, R√∂hr and Steinmetz, p. 182Herwig, p. 205 They were assigned to the II Scouting Group, alongside the cruisers , , , , and .Woodward, p. 116 The ships were in service in time for the major fleet operation to Norway in 23‚Äì24 April 1918. The I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group, along with the Second Torpedo-Boat Flotilla were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway, with the rest of the High Seas Fleet steaming in support.Halpern, p. 418 The Germans failed to locate the convoy, which had in fact sailed the day before the fleet left port. As a result, Admiral Reinhard Scheer broke off the operation and returned to port.Halpern, p. 419 In October 1918, the two ships and the rest of the II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy. C√∂ln, Dresden, Pillau, and K√∂nigsberg were to attack merchant shipping in the Thames estuary while the rest of the Group were to bombard targets in Flanders, to draw out the British Grand Fleet. Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.Tarrant, pp. 280‚Äì281 On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied.Tarrant, pp. 281‚Äì282 The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.Tarrant, p. 282 When informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated, \\"I no longer have a navy.\\"Herwig, p. 252 Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. C√∂ln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event that she needed to be towed.van der Vat, p. 119 Despite the problematic turbine, C√∂ln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.van der Vat, pp. 128-129 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.Herwig, p. 256 C√∂ln sank at 13:50 and was never raised for scrapping.Gr√∂ner, p. 115 In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of C√∂ln and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as part of an effort to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.Gannon NotesReferences    Category:C√∂ln-class cruisers Category:Ships built in Hamburg Category:1916 ships Category:World War I cruisers of Germany Category:World War I warships scuttled at Scapa Flow Category:Maritime incidents in 1919 ","title":"SMS C√∂ln (1916)"},{"id":"3791478","text":"GBV may refer to: * GB virus C * Gbanu language * Gender-based violence * Guided by Voices, an American indie rock band ","title":"GBV"},{"id":"3791480","text":"Sapotskin (, , , , ) is a small town in Belarus, north-west of Hrodna with circa 2,000 inhabitants. Sapotskin became one of the centers of the Polish minority in Belarus. It is the only town in Belarus where the Polish population, consisting of the majority, was allowed to use bilingual street signs. History Synagogue in 1936. Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Sapotskin was part of Trakai Voivodeship. In 1795, Sapotskin was acquired by the Kingdom of Prussia as a result of the Third Partition of Poland and incorporated into the New East Prussia Province. From 1807 until 1815, Sapotskin was part of Lomza Department of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815, Sapotskin was acquired by the Russian Empire. Within the Russian Empire, the town was successively part of Augustow Voivodeship (1815-1837), Augustow Governorate (1837-1867) and Suwa≈Çki Governorate (1867-1915) before German occupation between 1915 and 1918. From 1921 until 1939, Sapotskin was part of the Second Polish Republic. It was a gmina centre in the Augustow powiat of Bia≈Çystok Voivodeship. In September 1939, Sapotskin was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. The area became part of the Belastok Region of the Byelorussian SSR, with Sapotskin as a regional centre. On 22 June 1941, the Germans invaded the Soviet Union and set fire to Sapotskin. The Jewish population at that time was around 1300, and the Germans ordered them to dig mass graves and bury the hundreds of dead from the shelling and fire, both Jewish and non-Jewish. The Germans then asked local Poles to identify Jewish collaborators with the Soviet occupation. The Poles gave them a long list, some of whom had nothing to do with the Soviet regime, including the local rabbi and other community leaders, and those Jews were executed. After that, surviving Jews were confined to a seriously overcrowded and unsanitary ghetto. Those conditions, plus the lack of clean water, led to an outbreak of cholera. In 1942, many Jewish men were sent to labor camps, older and sick Jews were sent to an unknown placce and executed, and in November, those remaining were taking to the Kielbasin transit camp. From there, about a month later, then were sent to the Grodno ghetto and then, in January 1943, to Auschwitz where almost all were murdered. Only a few Sapotskin Jews survived the Holocaust, including those protected by the Falejczyk and Bykowski families who were later named by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. A memorial book about the town's Jewish shtetl was translated into English. During the German occupation, Sapotskin was administered as a part of Bezirk Bialystok. Sapotskin was liberated by the Red Army on 18 July 1944. The town became a regional centre of Grodno Region. Old photographs of the town have been collected.

In 1664, Louis XIV decreed in the charter creating the French East India Company that French colonial law would be primarily based on the Custom of Paris, which was the variant of civil law in force in the Paris region.√âdit royal de mai 1664, √âdits et Ordonnances (√©dition de 1854), tome 1, p. 40; cited in Le Droit Priv√© au Canada - √âtudes comparatives / Private Law in Canada - A Comparative Study, Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press, 1975, Vol. I, para. 1.An Act respecting the Codification of the Laws of Lower Canada relating to Civil matters and Procedure, S.Prov.Can. 1857, \\"Preamble.\\" Justice was administered according to the ‚ÄúCode Louis‚Äù, consisting of the 1667 ordinance on civil procedure and 1670 ordinance on criminal procedure. Trials were conducted under an inquisitorial system. The French law merchant was in force as regulated by the 1673 ‚ÄúCode Savary‚Äù on trade. In 1763, at the conclusion of the Seven Years' War, France ceded sovereignty over Quebec to Britain, in the Treaty of Paris. The British Government then enacted the Royal Proclamation of 1763Royal Proclamation, 1763, R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1. which set out the principles for the British government of the colony. In particular, the Royal Proclamation provided that all courts in Quebec were to decide \\"... all Causes, as well Criminal as Civil, according to Law and Equity, and as near as may be agreeable to the Laws of England.\\" This provision displaced the Paris customary law for all things civil and criminal. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act,Quebec Act, 1774, 14 George III, c. 83 (U.K.). which re-instated the civil law legal system for private law in general and property law in particular. The key provision of the Quebec Act was s. VIII, which provided that all disputes relating to \\"Property and Civil Rights\\" were to be decided by the former law of Quebec. This phrase was carried forward as s. 92(13) of the British North America Act, 1867.Constitution Act, 1867 , 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 3 (U.K.), R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 11. This section granted all the provinces, including Quebec, the exclusive power to legislate with respect to private civil law matters. While the other provinces operate under common law, Quebec continues to apply civil law toward civil private law matters. In areas of law under federal jurisdiction, however, Quebec is, like its fellow Canadian provinces and territories, subject to common law. Quebec has therefore a bijuridical legal system. Civil law and common law occasionally overlap or contradict each other. For instance, under section 91 (26) of the British North America Act, 1867, marriage and divorce fall under federal jurisdiction. However, marriage ceremonies are solemnized according to the Quebec civil code, while divorce proceedings may apply federal laws and regulations and common law concepts such as in loco parentis which has no equivalent at civil law according to which only the biological or legally adoptive relationship with offspring are recognized. Criminal law is, however, based on the common law system and applied at the Federal level. See Law of Canada.  The Civil Codes = The Civil Code of Lower Canada  In 1866, the Parliament of the Province of Canada enacted the Civil Code of Lower Canada.An Act respecting the Civil Code of Lower Canada, S.Prov.Can. 1865, c. 41. This Civil Code applied only in Lower Canada, which a year later became the Province of Quebec. The Code was comprehensive and covered all areas of private civil law. The Code was largely based on and inspired by the Napoleonic Code of 1804. The Civil Code of Lower Canada consisted of four books: # Persons; # Property and its Different Modifications; # Means of Acquiring and Owning Property; # Commercial Law.  Civil Code of Quebec (1980)  In 1980, the Province of Quebec enacted a new Civil Code of Quebec,Civil Code of Quebec, S.C. 1980, c. 39, s. 1. dealing only with family law. This was an intermediary stage in the development of an entirely new Civil Code. The Legislature decided to enact this new Code because of the need for immediate reforms to the family law of Quebec.\\"A Short History of the Civil Code Reform.\\"  Civil Code of Quebec  Quebec's current civil code, the Civil Code of Quebec,Civil Code of Qu√©bec, S.Q. 1991, c. 64. was the product of a lengthy review of the civil law, beginning with the establishment of the Civil Code Revision Office in 1955. The new Civil Code of Quebec was enacted in 1991, and came into force in 1994. This Code repealed both the Civil Code of Lower Canada and the Civil Code of Quebec of 1980. The current Code consists of ten books: # Persons # The Family # Successions # Property # Obligations # Prior Claims and Hypothecs # Evidence # Prescription # Publication of Rights # Private International Law  Lawyers in Quebec  Unlike in the other Canadian provinces, Quebec possesses two distinct types of lawyers. In Quebec, lawyers are either advocates or notaries. Indeed, statute forbids a lawyer from having a dual practice, i.e. an advocate cannot practice both as an advocate and a notary at the same time.See Article 55, Code of ethics of notaries, CQLR c N-3, r 2. Advocates are similar but not identical to the all-purpose lawyers of the common law system because Quebec advocates are restricted to litigation and any other contentious legal business (e.g. torts, crimes, will contests, divorces, etc.). Advocates must have a bachelor's degree in civil law, complete an articled clerkship, pass the professional bar course and be called to the Quebec bar before being able to practise. Currently, 5 universities in Quebec and one university in Ontario offer an undergraduate degree in civil law, under various names: McGill University grants a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, the University of Ottawa grants a Licence en droit (LL.L.) while the other universities, such as Universit√© Laval, grant a Bachelor of Laws degree (LL.B.). Notaries in Quebec, like those in other countries with legal systems based on civil law, are office lawyers who are restricted to non-contentious legal business such as real estate, law of inheritance, non-contentious family law, and company law. To practise as a notary, candidates must have, in addition to a law degree, a 1-year master's degree in notarial law and be a member of the Quebec notaries‚Äô society (Chambre des notaires du Qu√©bec).

Cindy Kane. Common Sense Media. Retrieved 2011-12-06 Summary Middle school teacher Eva Marie Olinski returns to teaching after an accident left her paraplegic. She chooses four of her sixth-grade students (Ethan, Noah, Nadia, and Julian), who form a group they call 'The souls', to represent her class in the Academic Bowl competition. They defeat the other sixth-grade teams, then the seventh- and eighth-grade champions at Epiphany, and so on until they become New York state middle school champions. The children help their teacher live a happier life after her win. A child named Hamilton Knapp makes fun of her and makes life harder for her. Later The Souls stick out their arms and legs when Mrs. Olinski stands up for herself when Hamilton and his follower Jared Lord harass the class. They stick out their limbs to show that she can stand up for herself. Between chapters that feature the progress of the competition, each of the four students narrates one chapter related both to the development of The Souls and to a question in the state championship final. Noah Gershom recounts learning calligraphy and being best man for his grandfather's friend at his wedding in Century Village in Florida. Nadia Diamondstein describes working to conserve sea turtles and meeting Ethan, also at Century Village. Ethan Potter tells of meeting Julian, a new boy in town, and attending his tea parties, where the four Souls became friends. Julian Singh explains being new at school and tells of handling a chance for revenge against one of the bullies ‚Äî remarkably grounded in the part played by Nadia's dog in the school musical. Characters *Mrs. Eva Marie Olinski teaches at Epiphany Middle School. She feels that sixth-grade students have descended from Now what?\\" to \\"So what?\\" during the years she has been away. Once shaken by her injury (car crash) and left paraplegic, she has suffered also from how students receive her. The four Souls respect her and help restore her confidence as a teacher, although they are not as the Academic Bowl team representing her class. For a long while, she is not certain why she picked them, but with help from her friend Mr. Singh, she finally sees why, as explained in a long and confusing anecdote. *Noah Gershom has brown hair and wears glasses. His mother is a real estate agent and his father is a dentist who employs Nadia's mom. In Noah's story, he visits his grandparents who reside in a retirement home in Florida, where he unexpectedly has an opportunity to learn calligraphy and accidentally becomes the best man at the wedding of Izzy Diamondstein and Margaret Draper when always able to provide an answer and is a willing leader. As Noah learns, he cannot always be the hero, and that a team only wins the Academic Bowl by working together. *Nadia Diamondstein is a beautiful plump girl with curly red hair, which notably forms a halo in the sunlight. She recently moved to New York from Florida with her mother, who works as a dental hygienist for Noah's father. Her father is an accountant in Florida, where grandfather Izzy Diamondstein recently married Ethan's grandmother Margaret Draper, formerly a principal and Mrs. Olinski's best friend.<, ref group=lower-alpha>Review by Sigwald: Librarian John Sigwald remarks that \\"the characters hardly note the numerous links between Epiphany, New York, and Century Village in Florida. I found a family tree (with a few birds on the branches) to be useful ...\\". He provides a paraphrase of the tree. In the school play, Nadia's dog Ginger plays Little Orphan Annie's dog Sandy. She has a fondness for sea turtles. *Ethan Potter is a medium-sized boy with short, blond hair. He lives on a farm, and his family is one of the oldest in Epiphany. His grandmother, Margaret Draper, a teacher who retired to Florida, recently married Nadia's grandfather Izzy Diamondstein. Aware that he tends to disappoint his teachers, who compare and expect him to excel academically and athletically like his older brother, Lucas, or Luke, Ethan is a quiet and nervous individual until he becomes a part of the Souls. He loves theater, staging included, and has a secret passion for halos. His family's goal for him is to be a farmer while Lucas goes all around the world. *Julian Singh is an Indian boy with black hair and a British accent that he acquired as a boarding school student in England. His mother was a chanteuse, or singer, on a cruise ship who died young. His father is a cook and now an innkeeper at a farm in Epiphany that he has made into a bed and breakfast inn. There Julian has been \\"facilitator\\" of the four Souls, as host of 4:00 pm tea every Saturday. Julian was teased and bullied by other students this year, as a new boy from another culture. That was a learning experience, especially for Ethan. Julian is the last chosen for the quiz team, the missing piece from Mrs. Olinski's perspective. Julian makes the very best of things. When a bully wrote something that was not school appropriate on his backpack, he wrote: I AM A pASSenger on spaceship earth. When kids try to trip him, he says \\"excuse me\\" or \\"I beg your pardon\\". *Hamilton Knapp is the antagonist of the story and is the character who wrote the non school appropriate message on Julian Singh's backpack. Hamilton Knapp was almost the 4th member of the academic bowl team. Hamilton Knapp tried to drug Ginger in the play Little Orphan Annie's dog Sandy.

An early pioneer of outward foreign direct investment in the early modern period, he is considered by many as the father of Swedish industry for introducing Walloon blast furnaces in Sweden. He produced cannons for the German Protestant movement, the Dutch navy and the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company. Biography De Geer was born in Li√®ge, Belgium. He was the son of the iron industrialist and merchant Louis de Geer de Gaillarmont (1535-1602), and Jeanne de Neille (1557-1641). His father had previously (1563) been married to Maria de Jalh√©a (died 1578). In 1592, one of De Geer's half-sisters, Marie de Geer (1574-1609) married (1569-1636), a Dutch merchant and a director of the Dutch East India Company who lived in Dordrecht. Presumably due to ongoing turmoil in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge as well as his conversion to Protestantism, De Geer's father sold his properties in Li√®ge in 1595 and followed his daughter to Dordrecht, where since 1589 a neighborhood had existed populated by merchants from Li√®ge. In 1603, his daughter Margaretha de Geer (1583‚Äì1672) married Jacob Trip (1575‚Äì1661), brother and partner of Elias, further cementing the merchant families' relationship. Johannes Polyander appears to have been an important teacher of Louis Jr. in Dordrecht. From 1605 to 1608, De Geer trained as coppersmith in Roanne in France, after which he started his first business in La Rochelle. Returning to Dordrecht in 1611 he associated himself with his brothers-in-law. In 1612, he married Adrienne G√©rard (ca 1590‚Äì1634), also originally from Li√®ge, with whom he had 16 children. Having earned a fortune as a banker and industrialist he moved his family to Amsterdam in 1615. Owing to his extensive travels he received a good education in business. With the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War the demand for weapons increased enormously. In 1618, De Geer delivered weapons to Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, the Swedish king. Impressed by his business instincts the Swedish government allowed him to lease estates near Finsp√•ng, √ñsterg√∂tland in eastern Sweden proper. Before long, De Geer had established a formidable workshop industry there. In 1623 he was active in a Swedish trading company. The Swedish government continued to support him and De Geer received the monopoly on the copper and iron trade. De Geer, who adopted Sweden as his second home country, immigrated to Sweden in 1627. He hoped to evade paying toll in de Sont. In 1634, he bought \\"Het Huis met de Hoofden\\" on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam. His wife died after the birth of their sixteenth child. In 1640, De Geer travelled again to Sweden and was ennobled. In his new status he was able to buy 3/4 of the leased farmlands. his estate in Stockholm houses the Dutch embassy in Sweden. Working for Axel Oxenstierna he went to Amsterdam to support the war against Denmark. In 1644, at the start of the Torstenson War against Denmark, he singlehandedly equipped an armada of ships to sail against Denmark. This fleet contained a complete marine, 32 ships with sailors, weaponry and officers. The Swedes were able to conquer Fehmarn in Denmark, thanks to his aid. De Geer is also considered responsible for the Swedish Africa Company. When he founded the company a riot started in Amsterdam in 1649. His family also provided shelter to pacifist and humanist Comenius in his home in Amsterdam. He died in 1652 after falling ill during another voyage to Sweden. He returned to Amsterdam and died there. He was buried in the family grave in the in Dordrecht.

It was produced by Jes√∫s Grovas and directed by Juan Bustillo Oro, and also features Joaqu√≠n Pardav√©, Sara Garc√≠a, Sof√≠a √Ålvarez, and Dolores Camarillo. It was the twelfth film in Cantinflas's career, considered one of his best by Mexican film critics, as well as one of Mexico's best films. The film's sets were designed by the art director Carlos Toussaint. Plot summary Cantinflas is the boyfriend of Paz, the household maid of Cayetano Lastre. It is dinnertime and Cantinflas is waiting outside the mansion for Paz's whistle: a sign for Cantinflas to enter the kitchen to eat. This is because there is a dog in the front yard named \\"Bobby\\", and Paz's boss is unaware of Cantinflas's forays into the house. While waiting, another man also arrives to do the same, pulling out a cigarette and dropping his wallet in the process, which Cantinflas picks up when entering the house. Though like other times Cantinflas goes straight in to eat, this time his girlfriend has a favor to ask him: to kill the dog \\"Bobby\\" who has suffered a sudden onset of rabies and doesn't let Cayetano leave for an appointment. Seeing his hesitation, Paz is adamant: if he does not kill the dog, he does not get to eat. Cantinflas is nervous about the idea, but eventually kills the dog with a gun. Meanwhile, inside the house, after Cayetano leaves, his wife Dolores del Paso has given entrance to the other man: her ex-boyfriend Bobby Lechuga, a con artist who plans to blackmail her with some undated letters with a new date unless she does as he says. However, Cayetano suddenly returns to the house, as his over- bearing jealousy has led him to think that his wife cheats on him and has plotted a scheme to expose her supposed \\"adultery\\" red-handed. Hearing his arrival, Paz hides Cantlinflas and later does the same with Bobby. Cayetano finds and catches Cantinflas, assuming he is his wife's lover, but Dolores pretends that Cantinflas is her long-estranged brother, Leonardo del Paso. Being that his father-in-law (Dolores and Leonardo's father) needed the presence of all heirs to read and distribute their inheritance, Cayetano (whose business have been slow lately) begins treating Cantinflas like a king in order to gain his trust. Naturally, Cantinflas takes advantage of the situation. Things get complicated when Clotilde Regalado, Leonardo's partner, reads a newspaper clip mentioning Leonardo and the reading of the will, and makes her presence in the company of all of the couple's sons (and then some). Cantinflas tries to tell the truth about his identity to Cayetano, but as Dolores needs \\"Leonardo\\" to conceal the blackmail and Clotilde needs him to recognize and support her children, he continues to play along with the charade. Fully aware that Cantinflas is not the real Leonardo, she still moves over to Cayetano's house with the rest of her family, who are as much freeloaders as Cantinflas is. Intending for \\"Leonardo\\" to settle down, as well as to prevent him running away from \\"his\\" family and, by extension, further delay the reading of the will, Cayetano arranges for \\"Leonardo\\" to marry Clotilde. Cantinflas understandably hesitates and tries as much as he can to avoid being married, and when he is about to be forced to do so by using his fingerprints, policemen arrive at the house, looking for Leonardo. Confusion arises, as Bobby Lechuga has been killed and Cantinflas admits to killing \\"Bobby\\" (the dog, not the gangster), exacerbate by the fact that Bobby's wallet (which he picked up at the beginning) is found among his clothes, so he is arrested and put on trial. In a prolonged courtroom sequence, Cantinflas again confesses to killing \\"Bobby\\" the rabid dog, but as almost everyone in court sees him as Leonardo confessing to the murder of Bobby the con-artist, he is inevitably found guilty. Fortunately for him, the real Leonardo appears and explains about Bobby's blackmailing and the fact that he killed the extorter in self-defense. Cantinflas is fully acquitted and returns to his old antics, waiting outside Cayetano's mansion for Paz's whistle at dinnertime and then entering the kitchen to eat.

You're Missing the Point was the first feature film in which Mario Moreno was the lead actor. Under the name of his character in this film, Cantinflas, he achieved fame and used it as his stage name and the name of his characters in other films. In this film, he changed the film's director Juan Bustillo Oro's conventional sense of humor by presenting himself as linguistically as well as in appearance as a man of the common people, instead of using high-quality Spanish.Mora, p. 53 The film's last scene is based on true events involving Mexican criminal √Ålvaro Chapa, which inspired Cantinflas' form of speech for this film, also known as \\"cantinfleada\\". Bustillo Oro based it largely on his experience as a pro bono lawyer at the C√°rcel de Bel√©n. The film was completed in only three weeks, with the only problems arising from Cantinflas's improvisation over what he considered to be a poorly written script. In a comprehensive list of the 100 best Mexican films between 1919 and 1992, which was created by 25 film critics, filmmakers and historians and published on 16 July 1994 in the magazine Somos, You're Missing the Point was placed tenth.Wilt, p. 49 In 1950, the film was remade as '.

Built by Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard, it is the park's second roller coaster designed by that company following the success of Kumba, which opened 3 years prior. When the ride opened on May 16, 1996, it was the world's tallest and fastest inverted roller coaster, a title it has since conceded to Alpengeist at sister park Busch Gardens Williamsburg. The ride stands tall and reaches speeds of . History The concept of an inverted roller coaster with inversions was developed by Jim Wintrode, the general manager of Six Flags Great America, in the early 1990s. To develop the idea, Wintrode worked with Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard - from Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard - and engineer Robert Mampe to develop Batman: The Ride which opened in May 1992. In early 1995, planning began for Montu, fourteen months prior to the ride opening to the public. The owners of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, Busch Entertainment (since renamed SeaWorld Entertainment), entered into an agreement with Bolliger and Mabillard which would see them add Montu to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 1996, followed in 1997 by the additions of Alpengeist at Busch Gardens Williamsburg and The Great White at SeaWorld San Antonio. On May 16, 1996, Montu officially opened to the public. At the time of its opening to the public, the ride was the tallest and fastest inverted roller coaster in the world. Characteristics The Montu stands tall. With a top speed of , the ride features seven inversions including two vertical loops measuring , respectively, an Immelmann loop, a zero-g roll, a batwing and a corkscrew. Riders experience up to 3.8 times the force of gravity on the 3 minute ride. Montu operates with three steel and fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars, each sitting 4 riders in per row for a total of 32 riders per train. Montu was launched alongside Busch Gardens Tampa Bay's Egypt section of the park, which reportedly cost approximately US$20 million. With an overall theme around Egyptian mythology, the ride is named after the god of war Montu, a man depicted with the head of a hawk. When the ride was first launched, a Nile crocodile exhibit was located underneath the first turn out of the station. These animals were later relocated to the park's main animal habitat. Ride experience The ride begins with the floor retracting which leads to the front gate opening. The trains leaves the station with a small dip and turnaround out of the station tracking towards the chain lift hill. Once at the top, riders twist down to the left and into a vertical loop, reaching speeds of up to . Following the vertical loop, the track passes through a tunnel and zooms into an Immelmann loop, providing a footchopper element with the pylon. After completing the Immelmann, the train goes through a zero-g roll, where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness. Following the zero-g roll, the track hits a batwing, entering a trench at the valley between the two inversions. Leaving the batwing, the track rises up in to the mid-course brake run. Following the second brake run, the track makes a dive to the right into a trench where it hits a vertical loop. The track then exits the trench, making a three-quarter clockwise turn. After passing under the zero-g roll, the track makes a left hand turn over the first vertical loop's exit and dives into another trench to hit a corkscrew, before making another right turn onto the final brake run. Reception One of Montu's trains entering the zero-g roll Montu has generally been well received. Tom Buckingham of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune commended the ride, giving kudos to the park \\"for designing its monster rides so that wait times put Disney to shame\\". He stated \\"you'll generally be on the ride and screaming\\" before riders get a chance to change their mind. Sabrina Rojas Weiss of the Lakeland Ledger stated \\"the way this ride twisted my body upside-down and sideways seriously confused my senses\\". The Los Angeles Times put the ride on their \\"high rollers\\" list of new roller coasters for 1996. In 2012, Montu was featured on the Travel Channel TV series Insane Coaster Wars in the \\"Hang 'em High\\" category. Although the ride lost out to Aftershock at Silverwood Theme Park, Theme Park Review's Robb Alvey believed Montu would beat the competition which also included SeaWorld Orlando's Manta and Busch Gardens Williamsburg's Alpengeist. In Amusement Todays annual Golden Ticket Awards, Montu has consistently ranked highly. Montu is also one of only seven roller coasters to appear in the top 50 for all 15 years. It debuted at position 3 in 1998, before rising to position 2 the following year.

It was named after the tendency by artists to select from among multiple established styles of that era. A sensibility of relative renewal dominated the rest of Europe, while in Spain, Realism and Impressionism were slow to take hold. The movement is also said to be associated with the idea that models and innovations had run their course. Criticism Detractors consider it to be among the least brilliant periods in Spanish painting, in which there was a highly respectable level of skill, but no significant advancement of the form. This extends as far as the claim that practitioners used enormous canvases, of many meters in surface area, to give importance to something which didn't have any. Themes Spanish history was a predominant theme, especially from the Middle Ages and the reign of the Catholic Monarchs (Reyes Cat√≥licos). Anecdotal and sentimental scenes were the most popular, depicting highpoints of Spanish history with a human perspective, though not venturing beyond the earthly specifics of the subject. The style was frequently boosted by official establishments such as the Salones de Oto√±o (Salons of Autumn) and the Spanish Academy itself, which was chiefly interested in rigorous drawing and historical documentation. Development The subject of landscapes gained prominence with Spanish Romanticism until it became almost exclusive around the time of the Belgian painter Carlos de Haes, the first professor of landscape painting at the Spanish Academy. At the same time, a Catalan tendency toward urban and bourgeois scenes was developing. It eventually culminated in Catalan Pre-impressionism, which arrived with Mari√† Fortuny and Eduardo Rosales. Fortuny was credited with creating the tableautin (small tableau), a diminutive format depicting a comic or pleasant theme mainly intended to adorn the interior of a home. Artists The movement was exemplified by Francisco Pradilla Ortiz and Cano de la Pe√±a. Two others, Antonio Gisbert and Jos√© Casado del Alisal, were exponents of the bipartisan front for the imperial political regime of the time.

Crazy John's was the largest independent phone retailer in Australia, employing more than 400 people with more than 60 retail stores. Following his death in 2007, Ilhan's wife Patricia sold her stake in the company to Vodafone Australia, now a part of Vodafone Hutchison Australia. Originally a dealer of Telstra Mobile, Crazy John's became a Mobile Virtual Network Operator through the Vodafone Australia network, dealing directly with customers and offering its own competitive mobile phone deals and plans. History Crazy John's opened its first store in Brunswick, Victoria, in 1991. By 1998, there were fifteen store locations in Victoria, and the retailer was ranked in the top ten of Telstra's mobile dealers. they had 61 stores. The name Crazy John's came about through people constantly telling Ilhan his marketing ideas were \\"crazy\\", and the name stuck. Crazy John's came to prominence when it was the first company in Australia to offer $1 mobile phones. Following the death of the company's founder John Ilhan in 2007, his wife sold her 75% share of the company to Vodafone in September 2008. Approximately 200 staff became redundant. Closure In January 2013 Vodafone announced that it was to close up to 40 of their Crazy John's-branded stores by 20 February as part of their cost-cutting restructuring, Vodafone's parent company Hutchison Telecoms Australia having had a 131.3 million loss for the six months to 30 June 2012. The remaining 21 Crazy John's premises are to be re-branded as Vodafone Australia stores. Telstra legal disputes and defection Crazy John's was originally a dealer for Telstra Mobile, Australia's largest mobile telecommunications provider, with 900,000 customers providing close to 10 percent of Telstra's mobile revenue. In 2003, Telstra sent a letter by facsimile to Crazy John's demanding payment of A$21,283,642.61 it said was for the overpayment of trailing commissions, a percent of customers' phone bills. In the letter, Telstra hinted that, if the demand was not paid for, its contract as a Telstra dealer could be adversely affected. Crazy John's paid the $21 million, and immediately filed suit to demand it be refunded. Crazy John's claimed that Telstra's accounting system, MICA (Mobile Integrated Customer Accounts), used to bill its 8 million subscribers, was not able to provide the information required to produce an accurate bill and, therefore, support their payback demand. Industry analysts believed that Telstra may have been wanting Crazy John's to take a cut to its trailing commission, suggesting that Telstra believed Crazy John's could not make the payment, and it might be willing to renegotiate its commission percentage in lieu. However, Crazy John's was able to make the payment, and the situation reversed: instead of financially forcing the dealer to negotiate, Telstra was in a position of being sued and required to justify its $21 million demand, which Crazy John's believed it could not do. In May 2005, Telstra issued a second, $12 million demand, again for more alleged overpaid trailing commissions. Crazy John's applied for an injunction in the Federal Court in Melbourne to prevent Telstra from going ahead with this second demand. This was dismissed by Justice Mark Weinberg; Crazy John's paid the amount, and rolled the figure into its original refund demand, bringing the total to $33 million. At the same time, company founder John Ilhan announced his intention to dump Telstra in 2007 when its contract expired, and instead would buy its own airtime from a wholesale source and serve customers directly, rather than passing them on to Telstra. Ilhan said he was \\"fed up with Telstra's bullying\\" and that it \\"isn't competitive any longer\\". Telstra, on the other hand, began threatening to not renew the exclusive reseller agreement it had with Crazy John's when it ended on 1 July 2007, if didn't agree to new terms that included less commission per customer. Telstra did just that, giving the required two years notice in July 2005. After announcing his intention to defect from Telstra at the end of its contract, Telstra created a new company, BQ Communications, to compete against Crazy John's. In affidavits lodged in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Crazy John's claimed that Telstra was poaching Crazy John's staff to start up the company ‚Äì including Bill Asermakidis, the former national sales manager ‚Äì and \\"raping\\" its customer database by taking price lists and the names of customers. Telstra denied many of the claims made in the affidavits, but not the new company. On 1 July 2007, Crazy John's made the transition towards becoming a Mobile Virtual Network Operator through the Vodafone network. The deal allowed Crazy John's to deal directly with mobile phone handset manufacturers and offer its own competitive mobile phone plans. Just days before the switch to Vodafone, Telstra sought a court injunction to prevent Crazy John's from using confidential information in contacting Telstra's customers to sign them up to new contracts. Crazy John's agreed to limit the amount of customer information it can use after its contract ended. Marketing and sponsorship Crazy John's were a sponsor of the Collingwood Football Club. In 2003, Crazy John's bid for the naming rights to Subiaco Oval, in Perth, Western Australia, but soon lost it due to community action.

Stygofauna and troglofauna are the two types of subterranean fauna (based on life-history). Both are associated with subterranean environments ‚Äì stygofauna are associated with water, and troglofauna with caves and spaces above the water table. Stygofauna can live within freshwater aquifers and within the pore spaces of limestone, calcrete or laterite, whilst larger animals can be found in cave waters and wells. Stygofaunal animals, like troglofauna, are divided into three groups based on their life history - stygophiles, stygoxenes, and stygobites. # Stygophiles inhabit both surface and subterranean aquatic environments, but are not necessarily restricted to either. # Stygoxenes are like stygophiles, except they are defined as accidental or occasional presence in subterranean waters. Stygophiles and stygoxenes may live for part of their lives in caves, but don't complete their life cycle in them. # Stygobites are obligate, or strictly subterranean, aquatic animals and complete their entire life in this environment. Extensive research of stygofauna has been undertaken in countries with ready access to caves and wells such as France, Slovenia, the US and, more recently, Australia. Many species of stygofauna, particularly obligate stygobites, are endemic to specific regions or even individual caves. This makes them an important focus for the conservation of groundwater systems. Diet and lifecycle The Alabama cavefish, (Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni) Stygofauna have adapted to the limited food supply and are extremely energy efficient. Stygofauna feed on plankton, bacteria, and plants found in streams. Orconectes australis, a cave crayfish To survive in an environment where food is scarce and oxygen levels are low, stygofauna often have very low metabolism. As a result, stygofauna may live longer than other terrestrial species. For example, the crayfish Orconectes australis from Shelta Cave in Alabama can reproduce at 100 years and live to 175. The Tumbling Creek cavesnail (Antrobia culveri) is a typical stygobite: small, white and blind. Distribution and species Stygofauna are found all over the world and include turbellarians, gastropods, isopods, amphipods, decapods, fishes, or salamanders. Stygofaunal gastropods are found in the U.S, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Stygobite turbellarians can be found in North America, Europe and Japan. Stygobite isopods, amphipods and decapods are found widely around the world. Cave salamanders are found in Europe and the U.S, but only some of these (such as the olm and Texas blind salamander) are entirely aquatic. The approximately 170 species of stygobite fish, popularly known as cavefish, are found in all continents, except Antarctica, but with major geographical differences in the species richness. Collecting stygofauna Several methods are currently used to sample stygofauna. The accepted method is to lower a haul net, which is a weighted plankton net (with minimum 50 ¬µm mesh size), to the bottom of the bore, well or sinkhole and jiggled to agitate sediments at the base of the bore. The net is then slowly retrieved, filtering stygofauna out of the water column on the upward haul. A more destructive method is to pump bore water (using a Bou-Rouch pump) through a net on the surface (referred to as the Karaman-Chappuis method). These two methods provide animals for morphological and molecular analyses. A video camera can also be used down the hole, providing information on life-history of the organisms but, given the small size of the animals no species determinations can be made.

Subvocal recognition (SVR) is the process of taking subvocalization and converting the detected results to a digital output, aural or text-based.  Concept  A set of electrodes are attached to the skin of the throat and, without opening the mouth or uttering a sound, the words are recognized by a computer. Subvocal speech recognition deals with electromyograms that are different for each speaker. Therefore, consistency can be thrown off just by the positioning of an electrode. To improve accuracy, researchers in this field are relying on statistical models that get better at pattern-matching the more times a subject \\"speaks\\" through the electrodes, but even then there are lapses. At Carnegie Mellon University, researchers found that the same \\"speaker\\" with accuracy rates of 94% one day can see that rate drop to 48% a day later; between two different speakers it drops even more. Relevant applications for this technology where audible speech is impossible: for astronauts, underwater Navy Seals, fighter pilots and emergency workers charging into loud, harsh environments. At Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, research is underway to use subvocal information as a control source for computer music instruments. Research and patents With a grant from the U.S. Army, research into synthetic telepathy using subvocalization is taking place at the University of California, Irvine under lead scientist Mike D'Zmura.http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27162401/ NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View, California, under the supervision of Charles Jorgensen is conducting subvocalization research. The Brain Computer Interface R&D; program at Wadsworth Center under the New York State department of health has confirmed the existing ability to decipher consonants and vowels from imagined speech, which allows for brain-based communication using imagined speech. US Patents on silent communication technologies include: US Patent 6587729 \\"Apparatus for audibly communicating speech using the radio frequency hearing effect\\", US Patent 5159703 \\"Silent subliminal presentation system\\", US Patent 6011991 \\"Communication system and method including brain wave analysis and/or use of brain activity\\", US Patent 3951134 \\"Apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brain waves\\".

He was the first married man in America to serve as Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Early life Roberts was born in Frederick County, Maryland. His father was of Welsh and his mother of Irish ancestry. They were communicants of The Church of England. In 1785 the family moved to the Ligonier Valley, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. Roberts united with the M.E. Church when he was fourteen years old. Until he was twenty-one his was a thoroughly frontier existence, with few books and quite simple habits. Yet early on he commenced with study, all the while being drawn gradually toward the Ministry. Ordained Ministry After much hesitation, owing to great timidity, Robert preached his first sermon in 1801. He was licensed as a local preacher at the Holmes Meeting-house near Cadiz, Ohio. In the Spring of 1802 he was received on trial in the Baltimore Annual Conference, and appointed to a circuit including Carlisle, Pennsylvania and twenty-nine other preaching appointments in Western Pennsylvania, Maryland and Ohio. He was ordained, both Deacon and Elder, by Bishop Francis Asbury. It took as long as a month to visit the entire circuit. Roberts studied constantly. In 1804 a senior colleague reported that \\"his moral character was perfect and his head a complete magazine.\\" He was then sent by Bishop Asbury to Baltimore, where he reluctantly went, as he doubted his being suited to city congregations. Subsequently, Rev. Robert filled appointments in Baltimore, Alexandria, Virginia; Georgetown, and Philadelphia. In 1815 he was appointed Presiding Elder of the Schuylkill District of the Philadelphia Annual Conference. Owing to the death of Bishop Asbury, Rev. Roberts was elected to preside over the Philadelphia Annual Conference in the spring of 1816. Episcopal Ministry At the General Conference of 1816, the Rev. Robert Richford Roberts was elected to the office of Bishop, 14 May 1816. Being the first married man to serve as a Methodist Bishop, and the financial support for a Bishop being exceedingly small (since his predecessors had all had no dependents), Bishop Roberts settled in the western part of Pennsylvania upon a farm which he owned. From there he traveled extensively from Maine to Mississippi. Subsequently, he removed to Indiana and settled on a farm near White River, continuing to preach, visit the churches, and attend the Conferences in all parts of the Union. He accomplished much for missions in the west (i.e., western states, which then included Indiana, etc.). Indeed, only a year or two before his death he visited the Indian mission work of his denomination west of Arkansas. Bishop Roberts was involved in all the discussions and deliberations that culminated in the establishment of the Methodist Protestant Church. Bishop Matthew Simpson wrote of him during this time: :while during these excitements severe and exciting denunciations of the Bishops were publicly made‚Äìwhile they were called 'popes' and 'usurpers'‚Äìthe patriarchal appearance and the humble and loving manner of Bishop Roberts disarmed prejudice wherever he went. Death and legacy In the spring of 1843 Bishop Roberts contracted bilious fever. He died March 26, 1843 in Lawrence County, Indiana. He is buried along with his wife on the grounds of United Methodist- affiliated DePauw University, where there is also a residence hall named in his honor. The Roberts Park Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Indianapolis is named for him, too.

Gachas manchegas with a local wine in the background The berenjenas de Almagro Migas with fried egg, peppers, and sausage Atascaburras, a typical regional dish. Manchego cuisine; chickpea and Silene vulgaris stew. (Potaje de garbanzos y collejas) Manchego cuisine (Manchegan cuisine or Castilian-Manchego cuisine) refers to the typical dishes and ingredients in the cuisine of the Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha region of Spain. These include pisto (a vegetable stew with tomato sauce), gazpacho manchego, Manchego (a type of cheese), the white wine of La Mancha, and the red wine from Valdepe√±as (DO). The dishes and specialties of the region are generally sober and sensible, reflecting a modest, rural origin. They contain a limited number of ingredients. Ingredients tend to be those most easily accessible by the locals. Dishes tend to be high in calories, ideal for the diets of laborers, farmers, and shepherds. The cuisine of this area was popularized by Miguel de Cervantes in his early 17th century novel Don Quixote, where a number of traditional dishes are mentioned. Staples In La Mancha, traditional dishes include gachas de almorta, a paste made with grass pea (Lathirus sativus) flour, and tortas de gazpacho, a flat bread that is the base for the \\"gazpachos\\", an elaborate dish appearing in El Quixote under the name of \\"galianos\\".  Fruits and vegetables = Local ingredients  One of the local vegetables is the bladder campion (Silene vulgaris) plant, known colloquially as collejas. These plants are traditionally gathered in the mountains of La Mancha (as well as others parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia) and used for a variety of dishes. Like most Spanish cuisine, many local dishes contain garlic, including tiznao (salt cod with spring onions) and atascaburras (salt cod with mashed potatoes, also called ajoarriero). Additionally, the √±ora, a cultivated version of the Capsicum annuum pepper from Valencia, is often used in local dishes such as manitas de cerdo (pig's feet) and migas. Standalone products include berenjenas de Almagro, a variety of small aubergines that are grown in Almagro, Ciudad Real. These are seasoned and pickled according to a traditional recipe and usually eaten as a snack or side dish.  Vegetarian dishes  There are not many purely vegetarian dishes in the region. Some traditional vegetable-based dishes are pisto manchego (a local equivalent of ratatouille), pipirrana (a salad of onion, tomato, and cucumber), asadillo de la Mancha (roasted red peppers), and gazpacho viudo (widower gazpacho, or gazpacho made with bladder campion leaves).  Meat and fish There are many local meat dishes, which consist primarily of sheep, goat, and, to a lesser degree, beef. The most important dishes are carcamusas (typical of Toledo), chanfarina, roast lamb, cuchifrito, migas, gallina en pepitoria (chicken a la pepitoria), salpic√≥n, paturrillo, and zarajos. In areas where there is a lot of hunting, a number of game based dishes are also popular, such as conejo al ajillo (rabbit with garlic), liebre a la cazadora (hare hunter-style), and caldereta manchega. La Mancha is a landlocked area with historically few bodies of freshwater to allow for the generalization of fish in its cuisine. The traditional fish is therefore bacalao (salt cod), which was historically imported from coastal areas and does not spoil. This can be found in some dishes, notably chickpeas with cod, eaten during Lent.  Cheeses  Queso manchego, or \\"cheese from La Mancha\\", is one of the most famous Spanish cheeses; more than 30% of Spain's cheese products are of this variety. It is a cured cheese made from the milk of local sheep (Ovis Aries Ligeriensis, also called ovejas manchegas) which abound in the pastures year-round. The mass of the cheese is fairly hard and dense, with an ivory-white color. It has a characteristically tart taste when it is new due to the natural flavor of the sheep's milk, though as the cheese ages it slowly develops a savory quality, which Carlos Yescas of the Oldways Cheese Coalition describes as \\"a delicate balance of buttery, tart, sweet, and nutty.\\" The cheese is also high in calcium, Vitamins A, D, and E, and natural protein. There are several varieties of queso manchego, differentiated by both curing time and individual tradition (some are submerged in olive oil while curing).  Wines  Wine production is very important to the region, which has many protected designations of origin for the area. The major PDO is D.O. La Mancha, but others include: D.O. Valdepe√±as in Ciudad Real; D.O. M√©ntrida in Toledo; D.O. Jumilla and D.O. Manchuela in Albacete; D.O. Mond√©jar in Guadalajara, etc. In addition there are numerous home-made wines, such as the sacramental wines known as \\"pitarras.\\"  Entr√©es  Desserts References  External links  *\\"La cocina del Quijote\\", * \\"Costumbres y cocina manchega\\", *Consejo regulador del Queso Manchego Category:Spanish cuisine ","title":"Manchego cuisine"},{"id":"3791867","text":"Cotton Center is an unincorporated community in western Hale County, Texas, United States, located about 12 miles southwest of Hale Center. Until the late 19th century, the Comanche tribe of Native Americans occupied the area. In 1907, with the coming of a branch of the Santa Fe Railroad, a number of farming operations were established. Cotton Center was originally created in 1925 as a consolidated school district, with a small unincorporated community site, containing the school, cotton gins, and various businesses to support the surrounding farms. In 1935, a local post office opened, and the first irrigation well was drilled. By the late 1940s, irrigation wells proliferated, pumping water from the Ogallala Aquifer. The community revolves around farming and is tied together by the school, which as of 2005 had 140 students in prekindergarten through grade 12.

In this fictionalized American-Japanese co-production film set in the early 1960s, a flight crew's mission is to rescue a liferaft of Japanese civilians stranded in rough seas.Paris 1995, p. 182. Flight from Ashiya was based on the 1959 novel by Elliott Arnold. The film was released in Japan as Ashiya Kara no hiko.Orriss 2018, p. 152. Plot MSgt Mike Takashima (Yul Brynner), Col Glenn Stevenson (Richard Widmark) and 1st Lt John Gregg (George Chakiris), all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon (Shirley Knight). She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila (Dani√®le Gaubert), an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one Grumman HU-16 Albatross air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his aircraft for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the aircraft at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.

In the 1970s, she was convicted of kidnapping Patty Hearst. In 2003, she was convicted of murder in the second degree for being the shooter in a 1975 slaying that occurred while she and other SLA members were robbing a bank in California. She was sentenced to eight years in prison for the murder. Early life Born in Baltimore, Maryland,The FBI poster gives some biographical details. Place of birth is given as Baltimore, Maryland, although with the note \\"not supported by birth records\\" and raised in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, Harris was the daughter of Frederick Schwartz, an engineer, and had a middle-class upbringing. She graduated from Indiana University with a bachelor's degree in language arts. Founding the Symbionese Liberation Army Emily and Bill Harris arrived in Berkeley, California in 1973 from Bloomington, Indiana. They came with their friends Gary Atwood and Angela Atwood. They soon joined a left-wing group that, among other things, visited prisoners in northern California. The Harrises met an escaped prisoner, Donald DeFreeze. They joined the SLA, created by Mizmoon Soltysik, Nancy Ling Perry, Joe Remiro, Russ Little, Willie Wolfe, Angela Atwood, Thero Wheeler and Camilla Hall. Emily Harris's nom de guerre was Yolanda. On November 6, the SLA committed its first public act, the assassination of popular Oakland, California school superintendent Marcus Foster. The SLA mistakenly thought Foster was behind a plan to create student identification cards for Oakland high schools. Subsequently, they kidnapped Patty Hearst, the college student heir to the Hearst newspaper chain. Later SLA and Opsahl murder Emily and Bill Harris took over the leadership of the SLA after six other SLA members died in a Los Angeles shootout with police and the house fire it triggered. After the fire, the Harrises spent over a year eluding the authorities with Hearst, and new members Kathleen Soliah, Josephine Soliah, Steven Soliah, Mike Bortin, Jim Kilgore, and Wendy Yoshimura. Hearst herself had since become a participant in SLA crimes. Yoshimura, Patty's closest friend while underground, was a fugitive for her involvement with explosives that were stored in a garage she rented. During that year the SLA committed a string of crimes, including an April 21, 1975, robbery of Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. During the robbery, 42-year-old Myrna Opsahl was shotgunned to death. Opsahl was depositing a church collection at the time. Hearst stated in her 1982 autobiography Every Secret Thing that Emily Harris was the shooter. Hearst stated that Harris said, \\"Oh, she's dead, but it doesn't really matter. She was a bourgeois pig anyway. Her husband is a doctor.\\" Other SLA members had urged Harris not to bring the shotgun to the robbery, as it had accidentally discharged twice during preparations. The Harrises were eventually arrested and served eight years in prison for the Hearst kidnapping. Imprisoned at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California, Emily Harris spent the first half of her term in solitary confinement. Emily learned computer programming in prison. Life after first prison term After her release from prison in 1983, Harris became a computer programmer and began a successful computer consulting company. She worked at MGM Studios until her second conviction. She divorced her husband. Opsahl murder charges For over 25 years no one was charged in the Opsahl murder. The SLA wore wigs and masks during the Crocker Bank robbery, and left little evidence behind. However, with new forensics techniques, the FBI was eventually able to link shotgun pellets removed from Opsahl's body to shotgun shells found in an SLA hideout. Additional evidence mounted, and in January 2002 Harris and three other SLA members were charged with the Opsahl murder. Harris's bail was set at $1,000,000, which her supporters quickly gathered. Three former SLA members who had been granted immunity ‚Äì Hearst, Steven Soliah, and Wendy Yoshimura ‚Äì were set to testify for the prosecution in the Opsahl case. Facing a possible conviction, Harris and the others pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in November 2002. Emily Harris was sentenced to eight additional years in prison; Bill Harris was sentenced to seven years and Kathleen Soliah and Michael Bortin were each sentenced to six years for their roles. Emily Harris was paroled in February 2007 after having served four years in prison.

Wac≈Çaw Jan Prze≈∫dziecki was born July 15, 1883 in Le≈õmierz near ≈Åƒôczyca, to a family of old Polish gentry of Pierzcha≈Ça Coat of Arms, deprived of all their property by the Russian authorities after the January Uprising. In 1903 he graduated from the Higher Trade School in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, after which he joined the Technological Institute in Kharkiv (modern Ukraine). In 1904 he was relegated from the institute for being a member of a secret Polish resistance organisation. The only school to accept him was a military college in Kazan, from which he graduated in 1906. Prze≈∫dziecki then joined the Imperial Russian Army and served as an adjutant in the officers school and the 260th Infantry Regiment stationed in Batum. In 1913 he was promoted to the rank of Captain. During the First World War he served with distinction in the first line as the company and then battalion commander. After receiving a heavy wound in Prussia, he was declared ineligible for service and dismissed. After the February Revolution he joined various Polish organisations in Russia, including the Central Polish Military Committee (NPKW), and fought in the ranks of the 1st Polish Corps during the Russian Civil War. In 1918 he returned to Poland and joined the renascent Polish Army. As the commanding officer of the Polish 12th Infantry Division he fought in the Polish-Bolshevik War. After the Peace of Riga he remained in service at various staff posts. In 1926 he became the commanding officer of the Polish 21st Mountain Infantry Division and the following year he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. Retired in 1936, he settled in a small villa in Natolin, several kilometres to the south of Warsaw. During the Invasion of Poland in 1939, he returned to active service and took part in formation of various reserve and improvised units for the German and then Soviet fronts. As the commanding officer of the Wo≈Çkowysk Cavalry Brigade he took part in the battle of Grodno, one of the most important Polish-Soviet battles of the war. After the battle he crossed the border with Lithuania, where he was interned with his soldiers. In 1940 however, after the Baltic States were annexed by the Soviet Union he was arrested by the NKVD and sent to the Kozielsk camp. Soon afterwards he was transferred to Lubyanka prison, where he was offered to lead a Polish Division created as an ally of the Soviet Union. When he refused and relied his reaction on the decision of the Polish Government in Exile, he was transferred to a special NKVD detention centre in Gryazovets. After the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement he was released from the prison and allowed to join the Polish II Corps, with which he moved to Persia, Iraq and finally to Palestine. There he was judged (at age 58) to be too elderly for active service. After the war he remained in Palestine, and in 1947 moved to Great Britain, where he was given a role at the Polish Hospital in Penley, Wales. Wac≈Çaw Prze≈∫dziecki died there June 29, 1964, aged 80.

The theory is based on the idea that society tends to identify groups of people as fundamentally 'different', and of less value than everyone else. It catalogs the methods of this 'devaluation' and analyzes its effects. It may be used by those seeking to counteract these methods and effects. A recent compilation of normalization and social role valorization was by Flynn and LeMay (1999); their work remains important today in Europe, New Zealand and Australia among other countries. Overview of normalization and social role valorization Although normalization and the initial versions of SRV were described as an 'Ideology', the most recent formulation explicitly denies that SRV is about what should be done, and reinforces that SRV is intended to be a tool for analysis of the process and effects of Societal Devaluation. Wolfensberger's most recent (1999) definition of SRV is: \\"the application of what science can tell us about the enablement, establishment, enhancement, maintenance, and/or defence of valued social roles for people\\" (Susan Thomas and Wolf Wolfensberger in Flynn and Lemay 1999, p. 125). Susan Thomas, long time professional educator with Wolfensberger, continues to teach through the Institute at Syracuse University as of 2012. University students and training institute colleagues can be found worldwide with many internationally seeking collaborative projects with the Wolfensberger (e.g., now Rannveig Traustadottir, now Gender and Disability Chair at the University of Iceland). Social role valorization (SRV) is a relationship theory of empirical knowledge for the design and rendering of formal and informal services and relationships to people with any need or condition, especially those who are devalued or are at risk. Social role valorization is intended to address the social and psychological wounds that are inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on those who are close to them. SRV does not in itself propose a 'goal'. However a person who has a goal of improving the lives of devalued people may choose to use insights gained from SRV to cause change. They may do so by attempting to create or support socially valued roles for people in their society, because if a person holds valued social roles, they are highly likely to receive from society those good things in life that are available, or at least the opportunities for obtaining them. In other words, all sorts of good things that other people are able to convey are almost automatically apt to be accorded to a person who holds societally valued roles, at least within the resources and norms of his/her society. Social role valorization identifies social devaluation as a critical human experience that has long-term effects on the individual. SRV is designed to raise consciousness about the fate of socially devalued persons. SRV holds that the human being is vulnerable to the regard of others for both the heights of edification and the depths of degradation. An understanding of social role valorization can lead to ideas about how to improve the lives of people who are devalued by society. These can be seen to have two themes ‚Äì firstly, removing devaluing features (for instance people being segregated from society in a building along with others perceived to belong to the same group), and secondly taking action that leads to people being valued. On one the approaches of SRV involves socially valued persons allying themselves with socially devalued persons. This alliance will unify people, broaden acceptance of differences, and encourage coexistence. SRV is a realistic if not pessimistic sense of human behaviour, holding that human beings are imperfect and capable of great evils even if they are occasionally saintly, heroic or kind. Basic structure SRV is a description of how societally differentiated people are devalued, assigned low-value roles, and treated poorly, often to the extent of risk to their own lives. This poor treatment is given to members of any group that is given low value by powerful forces in society. SRV considers only those things that can be known from a scientific perspective. In itself it does not subscribe to a particular ideology ‚Äì it does not say what should be done and it does not say what is morally correct. However, SRV does understand that human interaction is impossible without a moral code and so SRV can be used to suggest what is desirable given the spoken or unspoken moral code of a particular society or individual. Consequently, it is necessary to understand what sort of moral code and societal expectations might be around the implementation of any application of SRV. A consideration of the concepts of humanity and morality place SRV in an appropriate context. Any particular human society will have a set of written and unwritten rules about who is a member of that society and about how members of that society should act, and what treatment is due to non-members of that society. These rules are often set down in codes of law and in religious texts. Every society has such a moral code. Support for SRV can be found throughout the human sciences. Biology, evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology all lend strands to SRV. Even history and geography have ideas to contribute. Although SRV is not in itself a science, it is based on empirically produced disciplines. Science in psychology, special education and philosophy Psychology and philosophy tell us that there is considerable doubt about the common sense idea that we have total free will; what we do is often societally or physically caused by unconscious mechanisms. Science tells us that people do not often act as completely free-thinking individuals, but in fact occupy particular social strata and roles that organize and simplify their social communication. Particular people may be forced into a negative role which they do not desire. Science tells us that individuals and groups will place positive and negative values onto other individuals and groups. This assignation of value may lead to a process of devaluation. Complex societal forces mediate the exercise of power and social control in a society. These forces are often not well understood by individuals in that society. Individuals in a society are very aware of similarities and differences between members of that society. This is societal differentiation. Such difference groups may include people with the following differences from the valued norm: *People with mental difficulties (including those states labelled as mental illness and learning disability) *People with physical capability differences (including those labelled as having difficulties with mobility, body control and bodily integrity) *People with physical appearance differences (including those labelled as facially disfigured, unusual appearance, overweight or underweight) *People perceived to be of a different ethnic or racial group *People of different gender or sexuality *People who are labelled criminals (whether legally or morally so or not) *People who do not accept societal norms for whatever reason *People who use drugs (including those who use alcohol and nicotine as well as those who use chemicals more usually called drugs in the society) *People who exhibit lack of control according to the expectations of that society Psychology shows us that perception and interpretation are complex subjects, highly reliant on beliefs and prejudices. Human perception and interpretation is complicated and often not in accord with what 'common sense' tells us that it is. Learning and particularly imitation are the natural modes of behavior formation and are important in developing useful as well as damaging performances. Image and image transfer are important subjects when considering how people interpret each other and their own surroundings. Performance, reputation and grouping determine how people are seen and interpreted. Summary of relationship to theories of power, deviancy and role relations So, we may summarise: people who differ in any way from societal expectations or desirability, where this difference is negatively valued, will be badly treated by that society. Powerful groups in society will: *Define people as different *Treat people with the same or similar differences as a group. *If the difference is seen as negative, it will treat such groups badly. *It will assign negative deviancy roles to such groups and people. (These deviancy roles include: not human (animal-like, plant-like, less than human, not yet human, used to be human, alien), waste, trivium (clown-like, humorously insignificant), threat, burden of charity, and death related roles.) SRV suggests that role messages are largely conveyed by image, whether of the individual or of their surroundings (including accompanying people). A person's potential roles may be limited or assigned by the company they keep, the surroundings in which they live, or the activities they engage in. SRV suggests that Role Occupancy is dependent on apparent competency in that role. So the availability of roles may be limited or assigned by the person's ability (or, more importantly, the lack of ability) to perform the necessary role requirements for the effective performance of that role. =Effects related to role theories: good things and devaluation= People cast into such negative roles will be denied the good things in life: The good things in life: *Family or small intimate group *An intermediate but still small-scale group *A transcendental belief system *Absence of imminent threats of extreme privation *To be viewed as a human and treated with respect *To be treated justly *Friends *Work, especially meaningful work *Opportunities and expectations to discover and develop skills, abilities, gifts and talents *To be dealt with honestly *To be treated as an individual *Access to the 'sites of everyday life' *Being able to contribute, and having ones contributions recognised as valuable Further, such groups will be damaged in the following ways: 'Wounds' or bad things which happen to devalued persons: *Relegation to low ('deviant') status and rejection, perhaps by family, neighbours, community, society, service workers, leading to: **Cast into one or more historical deviancy roles **Symbolical stigmatising, 'marking', 'deviancy-imaging', 'branding' **Being multiply jeopardised, scapegoated **Distantiation: usually via segregation and also congregation **Loss of control, perhaps even autonomy and freedom, leading to: ***Discontinuity with the physical environment and objects ***Social and relationship discontinuity, even abandonment ***Absence or loss of natural/freely given relationships, and substitution of artificial/'bought' ones ***Deindividualization, leading to: ****Involuntary material poverty, material/financial exploitation ****Impoverishment of experience, especially that of the typical, valued world ****Exclusion from knowledge of, and participation in, higher order value systems (e.g. religion) that give meaning and direction to life, and provide community ****Having one's life 'wasted' ****Being the object of brutalisation, 'killing thoughts', and death making Other reactions to bad treatment Additional mental and behavioral response patterns that are evidence of disturbed interactions with the world, and that are engendered by certain wounds and wound clusters, are: *Feeling like being an alien in the world *A sense of worthlessness, dislike of self, despair *Insecurity *Failure sets and avoidance mentalities *Awareness of being a source of anguish to those who love one *Searching for the abandoner *Fantasy and inventions about relationships that do not exist, and may never have existed *Seeking/demanding physical contact, perhaps insatiably *Problematic testing of genuineness of personal and social relationships, particularly new ones *Turning the hurt into resentment or hatred towards privileged people, benefactors, society, or God *Withdrawing from human contact, perhaps even from reality *Rage, perhaps violence *A sapping of energy, both physical and mental, resulting in a lowering of intelligent behavior, and possibly even of intelligence The coping mechanism is to avoid negative roles and outcomes: *SRV suggests that in trying to avoid the above, it is most useful to seek positive valued roles for the devalued people and groups. *SRV suggests that such role re-valorization may be considerably more effective than other means of assisting people in devalued states. *Consequently, SRV suggests that enhancing competency and image (of the person and their surroundings) will result in positive roles being made a possibility for devalued people. *If such positive roles are supported and defended, and further positive roles are sought and achieved, then the devalued person will be more likely to achieve more of the good things in life, and avoid the Wounds and other Negative Effects secondary to Devaluation. Positive actions at different levels In order to ensure that positive roles are available to persons who have been devalued by society, it is necessary to consider actions at multiple levels: *The level of the person themselves (personal appearance and competency) *The level of the usual immediate environment of the person (where they live, work, learn and play) *The level of all the life arenas in which a person may engage (everywhere else they engage with society) *The level of society itself (how one may effect political, legal and moral change regarding the devaluation of individuals) SRV suggests that by these means, people who have been devalued by society may be rescued (or may rescue themselves) from the effects of devaluation, and may manage to live their lives occupying Valued Roles and become seen as valued by society. Other theories regarding \\"mentally handicapped\\" individuals include consciousness raising and implications for normalization from the women's movement, related self-advocacy movements in special education and rehabilitation, and now the new movement to community inclusion as represented at the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006). Criticisms # SRV has had a lifespan of barely a generation even if taking into account its predecessor normalization (resulting in Nordic countries in the first integrated generation worldwide). According to one editor, this timeframe compared to the history of asylums, should give anyone pause in granting to it a permanency in societies which is still being established and solidified. History would predict a period of transinstitutionalization and retrenchment, and again further efforts to develop and promote and strengthen community. # SRV does not consistently raise consciousness and guarantee concern about socially devalued persons in part because it has a moral base in societies which are struggling with ethical concerns in government and administration. Ideologies cannot ultimately control the character of their adherents even though they are influential. Further, their theoretical value can be nullified if used wrongly. More often, theories such as SRV are analyzed and presented inaccurately by their opponents, and a real debate seldom is forthcoming. # Not all alliances between socially valued and devalued persons are moral, fruitful and advantageous which follows the literature on attempts at co- optation of all civil rights movements. # Knowing how social devaluation works in society may still leave one impotent against it. However, efforts at social valuations, in the context of positivism, can counteract for individuals and families the literature's \\"downward spiral\\". # SRV's societal impact, thus far, is largely confined to several narrow human service fields. In part, this factor is due to the insular nature of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the categorical division of state agencies and delivery system. # SRV is open to criticism because of the later politico-moral stance (Christian, right wing conservatism) of its founder, Wolf Wolfensberger, in which he advances a non-mainstream response to the plight of the wounded (his conceptual term) in society. This response may be seen as anti-death (opposing all abortion and all forms of euthanasia), morally conservative, anti- bourgeoise feminist (stressing the 'importance' of motherhood rather than parenthood, and persistently relegating women to subsidiary power roles), homophobic, anti psychiatry and religiose. This criticism appears unjust in that Wolfensberger is an early proponent of the rights of people with mental retardation to marry, while other professionals placed the same individuals in institutional abuse and confinement. His doctoral students hold leadership positions in gender and disability, and he is associated with liberals in his own academic department who support actions in that context to address entrenched societal discrimination. # Although Wolf Wolfensberger attempts to isolate SRV from his underlying beliefs, SRV may be negatively affected by this association for those whom disagree with these moral and religious positions (which of course, include a decade of students and colleagues as well). Reference to the series of Pamphlets entitled 'TIPS' and edited by Wolf Wolfensberger provides graphic evidence of the politico-moral stance of the lead proponents of SRV. This criticism has resulted in liberals and moderates involved in broader discrimination movements (e.g., gay civil unions, Black & Grey Panthers, Red and Pink Hat Societies) to limit the involvement of SRV adherents in their work. # SRV, with roots in normalization and related citizen advocacy, supports unpaid relationships, giving, volunteerism, life commitments, and commitments to new approaches to shared living, including the co-residency model and the L'Arche communities. It can be suggested that all constructed attempts to re-valorize the roles and raise the social status of marginalised individuals and groups are hollow as they are artificial, but of course, government is responsible to provide minimum wage laws, to increase worker benefits, to maintain entitlements, to provide quality housing and beneficial and affordable health care. In other words, the person providing the re-valorization efforts such as a social worker or supported employment worker is paid to do his or her job, and is not helping the marginalised person out of genuine interpersonal motivation such as friendship, attraction or emotional attachment, and people are well aware of this monetary role in professions in human services. Therefore, any re-valorized role is viewed by those outside the relationship as non-genuine, unstable, though new evidence and theory (e.g., theories of social acceptance, versus deviance) suggests that beneficence and social acceptance are active and result in positive life outcomes. Thus, paid roles (sometimes preferred in modern life) would tend to negate the security-giving benefits that valued, familial and friendship roles would normally provide. Misconceptions Some criticism of social role valorization is said by its advocates to be because of misconceptions about it. Such misconceptions include: * that the theory sees that some people have more value, and others less (the theory speaks about how people are valued by society, in the assumption that all actually have equal value), * that social role valorization encourages action which supports the valuing of certain sections of society or behaviours (the theory actually encourages action that helps society to value groups previously 'devalued'), * that social role valorization works against self-advocacy efforts by a group of devalued people (the theory describes how labelling and segregating people supports social devaluation, but says nothing to deny that good can come from groups identifying themselves as having common cause or as having experiences or cultures in common). The theory of social role valorization is best understood as referring primarily to extreme devaluation (such that few people care much about what happens to an individual or group, or even actively look for their eradication) not more subtle (but still damaging) devaluation such as occurs between different social classes or between genders. Comparative community theories Social role valorization (SRV), similar to normalization, is a foundational theory with roots in intellectual and developmental disabilities, often termed learning disabilities in Europe. It is a revolutionary concept which took roots in the deinstitutionalization and community integration movements of the 1970s and 1980s which aligned themselves with its broad concepts and goals more so than with the specifics of the theory, goals and formulations itself. SRV and normalization adherents, in contrast, are committed first to the specific theories and have tended to be reluctant to engage in academic theoretical discussions with related theorists (e.g., independent and supportive living; support and empowerment paradigms; user- and-family directed services; self-determination and choice theories). In addition, other giants in community development such as Gunnar Dybwad, advisors to Presidents in the US, Brandeis University professor, friend of the Center on Human Policy, and former Arc-US director, often are missed in contrasting theory formulations. SRV is supportive of the development of community paradigms (e.g., Schwartz, McKnight, O'Brien, Taylor, Racino, Wehman, Roberts, Towell, Lakin, Bruininks, Braddock, Hemp, Rogan, Anthony, Carling, Seekins, Condeluci & Gretz-Lasky)Condeluci, A. & Gretz-Lasky. (1987). Social role valorization: A model of community reentry. \\"Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation\\", 2(1): 49-56. which were necessary to replace the institutional paradigms of the pre-expose era, however, with community paradigms taking over 20 years to become the mainstream academic publications. Today, new goals of integration, a basic principle of normalization, involve the integration of family studies to include families with a disability family member, integration of financing (e.g., housing and homes), long-term services and supports development (e.g., personal assistance, support aides for homes and families), and modernization to areas such as green and sustainability.Racino, J.

It is primarily used to treat congestive heart failure and high blood pressure. Metolazone indirectly decreases the amount of water reabsorbed into the bloodstream by the kidney, so that blood volume decreases and urine volume increases. This lowers blood pressure and prevents excess fluid accumulation in heart failure. Metolazone is sometimes used together with loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide, but these highly effective combinations can lead to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. It was patented in 1966 and approved for medical use in 1974. Medical uses One of the primary uses of metolazone is for treating edema (fluid retention) associated with congestive heart failure (CHF). In mild heart failure, metolazone or another diuretic may be used alone, or combined with other diuretics for moderate or severe heart failure. In addition to preventing fluid buildup, the use of metolazone may allow the patient to relax the amount of sodium restriction that is required. Although most thiazide diuretics lose their effectiveness in kidney failure, metolazone remains active even when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 30‚Äì40 mL/min (moderate chronic kidney disease). This gives it a considerable advantage over other thiazide diuretics, since renal and heart failure often coexist and contribute to fluid retention. Metolazone may also be used in kidney disease, such as chronic kidney disease or the nephrotic syndrome. Chronic kidney disease causes excess fluid retention that is often treated with diet adjustments and diuretics. Metolazone may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Metolazone and a loop diuretic will synergistically enhance diuresis over the use of either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects will occur at two different segments of the nephron; namely, the loop diuretic will act at the loop of Henle, and metolazone will act at the distal convoluted tubule. Metolazone is frequently prescribed in addition to the loop diuretic. Metolazone may be used for edema caused by liver cirrhosis as well. The other major use of metolazone is in treating hypertension (high blood pressure). Thiazide diuretics, though usually not metolazone, are very often used alone as first-line treatment for mild hypertension. They are also used in combination with other drugs for difficult-to-treat or more severe hypertension. \\"The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure\\" (JNC 7) recommends thiazide diuretics as the initial medication for treatment of hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide is by far the most commonly used, as it is both better-studied and cheaper (about four times) than metolazone, although as mentioned above metolazone is used in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease. Toxicity Since thiazide diuretics affect the transport of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, and angioedema. Metolazone, like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides (\\"sulfa allergy\\") may also be allergic to metolazone. Mechanism of action Schematic of a nephron. The distal convoluted tubule is labelled \\"2nd convoluted tubule\\" (the proximal convoluted tubule is the first) in this illustration. The primary target of all thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, is the distal convoluted tubule, part of the nephron in the kidney, where they inhibit the sodium-chloride symporter. In the kidney, blood is filtered into the lumen, or open space, of the nephron tubule. Whatever remains in the tubule will travel to the bladder as urine and eventually be excreted. The cells lining the tubule modify the fluid inside, absorbing some material and excreting others. One side of the cell (the apical side) faces the lumen; the opposite side (the basolateral side) faces the interstitial space near blood vessels. The other sides are tightly joined to neighboring cells. As with other regions, tubule cells in the distal convoluted tubule possess the ATP-powered sodium-potassium antiporter (Na+/K+-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP to transfer three sodium ions out from the basolateral surface (toward blood vessels) while simultaneously transferring two potassium ions in. The distal convoluted tubule cells also possess a sodium-chloride symporter on the apical side, which passively allows one sodium ion and one chloride ion to diffuse together in from the lumen (where urine is forming) into the cell interior. As sodium is pumped out of the cell by the ATPase, its intracellular concentration falls, and additional sodium begins to diffuse in from the tubule lumen as replacement. The symporter requires chloride to be transported in as well. Water passively follows to maintain isotonicity; excess chloride and potassium passively diffuse out the cell through basolateral channels into the interstitial space, and water accompanies them. The water and chloride, as well as the sodium pumped out by the ATPase, will be absorbed into the bloodstream. Metolazone and the other thiazide diuretics inhibit the function of the sodium-chloride symporter, preventing sodium and chloride, and therefore water too, from leaving the lumen to enter the tubule cell. As a result, water remains in the lumen and is excreted as urine, instead of being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Since most of the sodium in the lumen has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal convoluted tubule, thiazide diuretics have limited effects on water balance and on electrolyte levels. Nevertheless, they can be associated with low sodium levels, volume depletion, and low blood pressure, among other adverse effects. Pharmacokinetics Metolazone is only available in oral preparations. Approximately 65% of the amount ingested becomes available in the bloodstream. Its half-life is approximately fourteen hours, similar to indapamide but considerably longer than hydrochlorothiazide. Metolazone is around ten times as potent as hydrochlorothiazide. The primary form of excretion is in the urine (around 80%); the remaining fifth is evenly split between biliary excretion and metabolism into inactive forms. Chemistry The use of activated anthranilic acid derivatives facilitates the preparation of the amides in those cases where the amines are either unreactive or difficult to obtain. Metolazone center: Thus, reaction of (1) with phosgene gives the reactive the isatoic anhydride (2). Condensation of that with ortho-toluidine leads to the acylation product (3) formed with a simultaneous loss of carbon dioxide. This is then converted to the quinazolone (4) by heating with acetic anhydride. Reaction with sodium borohydride in the presence of aluminum chloride selectively reduces the double bond to yield the diuretic agent metolazone (5).  Structure  Metolazone is a quinazoline, a derivative of the similar diuretic quinethazone, as well as a sulfonamide. It is related to analogs of 1,2,4-benzothiadizine-1,1-dioxide (benzothiadiazine). These drugs are called benzothiadiazides, or thiazides for short. Chemically, metolazone is not a substituted benzothiadiazine, and therefore is not technically a thiazide. However, since metolazone, as well as other drugs like indapamide, act on the same target as thiazides and behave in a similar pharmacologic fashion, they are considered \\"thiazide-like diuretics\\". Therefore, they are often included in the thiazide diuretics despite not being thiazides themselves. History Metolazone was developed in the 1970s. Its creator, Indian born chemist Dr. Bola Vithal Shetty has been active in helping the U.S. Food and Drug Administration review drug applications, and in the development of new medicines. Metolazone quickly gained popularity due to its lower kidney toxicity compared to other diuretics (especially thiazides) in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Pathogenesis  In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, there is narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) due to hypertrophy of the interventricular septum. During systole, the narrowing of the LVOT creates a more negative pressure due to the Venturi effect and sucks in the anterior mitral valve leaflet. This creates a transient occlusion of the LVOT, causing a midsystolic dip in the aortic waveform. Towards the end of systole, the ventricle is able to overcome the obstruction to cause the second rise in the aortic waveform. In severe aortic regurgitation, additional blood reenters the left ventricle during diastole. This added volume of blood must be pumped out during ventricular systole. The rapid flow of blood during systole is thought to draw the walls of the aorta together due to the Venturi effect, temporarily decreasing blood flow during midsystole. A recent paper theorized that an alternative explanation for pulsus bisferiens may be due to a forward moving suction wave occurring during mid-systole.

It is one of seven radio stations in the Youngstown market owned by Cumulus Broadcasting. Its transmitter is located in Youngstown. WHOT competes with 95.9 KISS FM/Youngstown, WLER/Butler, WDJQ/Alliance/Canton, WKDD/Akron/Monroe Falls, WAKS 96.5 KISS FM/Akron/Cleveland, WQAL/Cleveland and WKST 96.1 KISS FM/Pittsburgh. On August 15, 2006 WHOT became the first station in Eastern Ohio to broadcast in HD until it ceased HD transmission in 2015. The connection between the WHOT callsign and the Top 40/CHR format is one of the longest running in modern radio history, dating back to 1955. WHOT is one of the first Top 40 stations in the country, as an daytime-only signal licensed to Campbell, Ohio on the 1570 kHz facility (currently home to the Warren, Ohio-licensed WHTX). Despite its technical limitations, the station attained high ratings in the Youngstown, Ohio market, which has lasted after frequency moves; first to 1330 kHz in 1963 (now WGFT), then to 1390 kHz (now WNIO) in 1990. By 1991, the AM and FM stations broke into separate programming with the 1390 kHz facility taking an adult standards format (one that would be revisited in 1999 when WNIO's call letters and format moved to that dial position), while the 101.1 MHz taking the Top 40 format. Excluding a period of several months when WHOT-FM carried a rock music format in late 1991-early 1992, the station has since continued with a Top 40/CHR format. Since 1995, the WHOT calls have existed exclusively on the FM dial. Prior to becoming WHOT-FM on February 1, 1984, the station used the call letters WSRD. WSRD, nicknamed \\"The Wizard\\", featured an Album-oriented rock format that was established back in the late 1970s. Known for many years as HOT FM 101, the branding was changed to HOT 101 in the 1990s.

The station is operated by volunteers and owned by the Taranaki FM Trust. History The station began in 1995, originally only broadcasting one month out of the year, but by November 1997, it was broadcasting full-time. It operated for almost a decade on 92.3 MHz, being run by a willing and enthusiastic pool of students and volunteers. As a result of a bureaucratic glitch, Most FM lost its original license in early 2008. The resulting public outcry caused by Most FM going off air led to the formation of the Taranaki FM Trust, a consortium of local businessmen and well-wishers who vowed to get the station back on air. In March 2008, after a two-month break in transmission, Most FM began operating on 107.6 FM, but on a very localised frequency range. However, on Friday 15 August, Most FM 'powered up' on the new frequency of 100.4 FM, moving up from 100 to 300 watts. The Most has a wide range of alternative and specialist shows, reflecting the eclectic tastes of its show hosts and DJs. In April 2010 the station began relaying on 88.3 MHz to the town of Oakura which was previously out of range. Internet streaming also resumed online. The station broadcasts live weekday mornings from 6:30am to 10am. During the day the output is programmed with a live drive show from Monday-Thursday and specialised shows on Friday afternoon. In the evenings a wide range shows are offered by volunteers and cover diverse genres such as Rock, Drum & Bass, Gospel, interviews with NZ artists and comedy. Saturday mornings are dedicated to a live local sports show followed by a live programme between 9 and midday with a range of music genres. Sundays are given over entirely to volunteers when a full day of shows kicks off at 8am and runs through until 8pm. Classic rock, Blues, Live recordings and Electronica all feature in the mix.

She was regent of Saxony during the minority of her son in 1139-1142. Life Gertrude was the only child of Lothair of Supplinburg, Duke of Saxony, and his wife Richenza of Northeim. After the death of the last Salian emperor Henry V, her father, backed by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz was elected King of the Romans in 1125, and ruled as Holy Roman Emperor from 1133 to 1137. First marriage To strengthen the ties with the Welf dynasty, Lothair married Gertrude to Henry the Proud, Duke of Bavaria since 1126. The lavish wedding ceremony was held on 29 May 1127 on the Lech fields near Augsburg. Indeed, Duke Henry became a loyal supporter in Lothair's struggle with the rivalling House of Hohenstaufen. The marriage also marked a significant increase of the Welf power: in 1136 Lothair vested Henry with the Italian March of Tuscany and, after the death of his father-in-law in 1137, Henry also succeeded him as Duke of Saxony. He furthermore inherited extended Saxon allodial lands around S√ºpplingenburg, Brunswick and Northeim. According to the contemporary chronicler Otto of Freising he ruled over a realm that stretched \\"from Denmark to Sicily\\". Henry and Gertrude had one son, Henry the Lion, born in 1129, who later became Duke of Saxony and Bavaria. Gertrude's husband had received the Imperial Regalia from his father-in-law, however, as much powerful as arrogant, he failed to succeed Lothair as King of the Romans, when he was defeated by his Hohenstaufen rival Conrad III in the imperial election of 1138. Refusing to pay tribute, he was banned and stripped off his Bavarian and Saxon duchies, which Conrad gave to his rivals Margrave Leopold of Austria and the Ascanian margrave Albert the Bear respectively. While defending his rights in Saxony, Henry suddenly died at Quedlinburg 1139, leaving Gertrude alone with their ten-year-old son. Regent Acting as Saxon regent, Gertrude with the aid of her mother Empress Richenza was able to secure the inheritance rights of her son by reaching a consent with the Hohenstaufen King Conrad III. In 1142 Henry the Lion was finally vested with the Duchy of Saxony by King Conrad III, after Albert the Bear renounced his rights. Henry the Lion himself in turn renounced his succession in the Duchy of Bavaria, which Conrad ceded to the Babenberg margrave Henry II Jasomirgott of Austria. Second marriage Gertrude and Henry II married on 1 May 1142 in Brunswick. They had one daughter, Richenza (b. 1143 - d. 1200), later wife of Landgrave Heinrich V of Steffling. The marriage produced no male heirs, as Gertrude died in childbirth at Klosterneuburg Monastery in Austria on 18 April 1143, which was her 28th birthday. She was buried at Schottenstift, Vienna. Henry Jasomirgott later married his second wife, Theodora Komnene, a niece of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. In 1152 King Conrad was succeeded by his nephew Frederick Barbarossa, who vested Gertrude's son Henry the Lion with the Duchy of Bavaria in 1156.

History  Map from 1877 atlas The town was platted on March 5, 1832 by William B. Bailey and his brother Horatio who named it Milford, for their home town of Milford, Delaware. The plat included 48 lots, two north/south streets (Main and East) and three east/west streets (Pine, Center and Warren). The first store opened in 1833 and was followed in subsequent years by several more businesses, including a liquor store, blacksmith, grocery, tannery, shoe-maker, wagon-maker and others. A post office was established on December 2, 1837 as Poolesville, in honor of the town's first resident physician, Dr. Poole ‚Äî it retained the name until August 13, 1904. In 1869 the citizens of the town voted to incorporate, and renamed it from Milford to Green Hill, owing to the town's Green Hill Seminary which the United Brethren established there. An 1883 history of the area cited Green Hill's population as \\"over two hundred\\". In common with many other small Midwestern communities, Green Hill diminished during the 20th century as its rural population dwindled or moved to more urban areas. Current population in undetermined, but satellite photography shows perhaps 30 homes in and around the town. One of Green Hill's most notable natives is NASA astronaut Donald E.

It is known by the common name glasswing butterfly for its unique transparent wings that allow it to camouflage without extensive coloration. In Spanish speaking regions, it may also be referred to as espejitos, meaning \\"little mirrors\\" because of its transparent wings. The butterfly is mainly found in Central and northern regions of South America with sightings as far north as Texas and as far south as Chile. While its wings appear delicate, the butterfly is able to carry up to 40 times its own weight.Lamas, G. (Ed.). (2004). Checklist: Part 4A. Hesperioidea - Papilionoidea. In: Heppner, J. B. (Ed.), Atlas of Neotropical Lepidoptera. Volume 5A. Gainesville, Association for Tropical Lepidoptera; Scientific Publishers. In addition to its unique wing physiology, the butterfly is known for behaviors such as long migrations and lekking. The Greta oto closely resembles the Greta andromica.  Geographic range and habitat  The glasswing butterfly is most commonly found from Central to South America as far south as Chile, with appearances as north as Mexico and Texas. This butterfly thrives in the tropical conditions of the rainforests in the Central and South American countries. Life cycle=Egg A nightshade plant Eggs are typically laid on plants of the genus Cestrum, a member of the nightshade family of plants, which serves as a food source for later life stages. Larva The caterpillars of the glasswing butterfly have green bodies with bright purple and red stripes. They are found on the host plants of genus Cestrum. The larvae are cylindrical in shape with dorsal projections that are smooth with filaments. These properties make the larvae extremely reflective, which essentially causes them to be invisible to predators. Pupa  The pupae are silver in colour. During the fifth instar stage, the pupa produces a silk pad on the lower surface of leaves through four spinning movements, onto which it attaches. The silk fibers are important in providing greater flexibility to the pupa attachment. The cremaster, a hooked bristle-like structure on the pupa, attaches to this silk pad by a series of lateral movements of the pupa‚Äôs posterior abdomen. Pupa attachment failure occurs when the silk pad breaks. Additionally, researchers have found the pupa attachment to have high tensile strength and toughness, which prevent the pupa from being pulled by predators or breaking off in the wind, allowing them to safely swing.Greta oto adult Lantana flower nectar is a food source for adult glasswing butterflies Adult The adult glasswing butterfly can be identified by its transparent wings with opaque, dark brown borders tinted with red or orange. Their bodies are a dark brown color. The butterflies are in length and have a wingspan of . Food resources=Caterpillar Poisonous plants of the genus Cestrum provide the best source of nutrition for the caterpillar; experimental studies have shown that when larvae use other host plants, they often die in the first instar stage or develop more slowly. The caterpillars feed on these toxic plants and are perhaps toxic to predators through secondary chemicals stored in their tissues. For example, the caterpillar chemical extracts are unpalatable to Paraponera clavata ants. Adult The adult butterfly feeds mainly on the nectar of the flowers of the genus Lantana, which includes 150 species of perennial flowering plants. They also eat flowers in the Asteraceae and Boraginaceae families and the droppings of insectivorous birds, absorbing amino acids that are later converted to proteins. Adult butterflies are also toxic due to the males consuming Asteraceae flowers whose nectar contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Migration The glasswing butterfly is migratory and travels up to per day at speeds of up to . It migrates in order to change elevations, and this migration causes there to be population density differences in varying geographical areas. Predation Birds are common predators of this butterfly. The glasswing combats predators by consuming toxins through plants of genus Cestrum and family Asteraceae in both the caterpillar and butterfly stages. Toxin consumption gives the butterfly a foul taste that discourages predation. Protective coloration This butterfly utilizes its transparency to hide from predators by camouflaging into the background during flight. Transparency is a rare trait among Lepidoptera, since they more commonly use mimicry to ward off predators. Mating This butterfly species mates polygynously, with males attempting to obtain one or more female mates per breeding season. Lekking In order to attract females, male butterflies form leks, or large gatherings where males compete for mates. They gather in shaded areas of the rainforest and competitively display themselves in order to attract mates. Pheromones Male glasswing butterflies release pheromones during lekking in order to attract females. The pheromones produced are derived from pyrrolizidine alkaloids that the butterflies obtain through their diet of plants of the family Asteraceae. The alkaloids are then converted to pheromones through the formation of a pyrrole ring, followed by ester cleavage and oxidation. Additionally, since the process by which the pheromone is produced is not only formed by butterflies and moths themselves, but also derived from plants, as with the glasswing butterfly, it is unlikely that the pheromone is used to distinguish between species. Physiology=Wings Glasswing butterfly wing nanopillars The transparency of Greta oto‚Äôs wings results from the combination of several properties: wing material has a low absorption of visible light, there is low scattering of the light that passes through the wings, and there is low reflection of the light impinging on the wing's surface. The latter occurs for a broad range of incident wavelengths, covering the entire visible spectrum, and all incidence angles. This broadband and omnidirectional anti-reflection property originates from nanopillars standing on the wing's surface which ensures a gradient of refractive index between the incident medium, air, and the wing's membrane. These nanopillars, non-periodically arranged on the wing's surface, possess a high aspect ratio (defined as height divided by radius), where the radii are below the wavelengths of the visible light. Additionally, they feature a random height and width distribution, which is directly responsible for the smooth refractive index gradient and thereby for the broadband and omnidirectional anti-reflection properties. These properties are further improved by the presence of pedestals at the base of the nanopillars. Additionally, the structure of the nanopillars allows for the wings to have a low roughness factor because of its tiny hair-like microtrichia features. This was experimentally tested through water droplet adhesion to the wings. Conservation The following national parks of Costa Rica currently feature the glasswing butterfly and are working on their conservation: Guanacaste National Park, Rinc√≥n de la Vieja National Park, Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, Palo Verde National Park, Carara National Park, Po√°s Volcano National Park, La Selva Reserve and Biological Station, Juan Castro Blanco National Park, Iraz√∫ Volcano National Park, Chirrip√≥ National Park, and La Amistad International Park.

Career Born in West Thurrock, Essex, Hunt started his career in non-league football, whilst training in business and tourism management, with King's Lynn and Kettering Town before being signed by then manager Jim Smith for Newcastle United in early 1991. Smith departed soon after, and Hunt continued to play under his successor Ossie Ardiles. However, this was not a successful time for the Magpies, who had fallen into the Second Division in 1989 and failed to make even the playoffs in the 1990-91 season. Ardiles reshaped the side for the 1991-92 season by drafting in more young players and adopting a very attacking style of football, but things failed to improve and by the end of October in 1991 the Magpies were bottom of the Second Division. Ardiles was sacked on 5 February 1992 and replaced by Kevin Keegan, who chose David Kelly and Micky Quinn as his first choice attacking force. Hunt was on the sidelines for much of the next 12 months before departing to West Bromwich Albion, where Ardiles was now the manager. Hunt scored a hat-trick on his home debut for Albion in March 1993 against Brighton. He scored the first goal in the Second Division play-off final in 1993 at Wembley as West Brom beat Port Vale 3‚Äì0 to gain promotion. Hunt was a regular over the next five seasons, creating an effective partnership with Bob Taylor, but West Brom failed to gain another promotion. In 1998, he joined Charlton Athletic, who had just been promoted to the Premier League, on a free transfer. Charlton were relegated in Hunt's first season with them, but in his second season Hunt scored twenty four goals as Charlton won Division One to win promotion back to the Premiership. However, he retired early from football during the 2000‚Äì01 season due to chronic fatigue syndrome. Hunt returned to Charlton briefly in 2003 to try to earn another contract, and played in three reserve games, but was not offered a contract. Hunt now runs the Belize Jungle Dome and Green Dragon Adventure Travel, a pair of adventure travel companies in Belize, with his wife, former MTV presenter Simone Angel. Hunt also maintains a blog which details how he became a professional footballer, and his thoughts on different football issues.
