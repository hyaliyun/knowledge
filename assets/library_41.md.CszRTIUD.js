The film is about an unbalanced mother (Nathalie Baye) bullying her 12-year-old son Julien (Victor Sevaux). Plot The mother intercepts and destroys letters from Julien's girlfriend and does not allow him to see her. He is not allowed to wear clothing he gets from his grandmother or buys with his own money. She rejects angrily a gift from the boy. She enters the bathroom while he is naked, when he covers his genitals she demands that he exposes them. She asks him to lie to his soccer trainer about why he can't come to a training session, in order that she and the boy can be together. Also she does not tell him about the death of his beloved grandmother until after the funeral. Julien's father is always busy with his work and supports his wife's behavior. Only Julien's elder sister is concerned about the negative effect of the mother's behavior on Julien's well-being, but the parents refuse to listen to her. Nevertheless the mother also sometimes shows some kind of love for Julien: she likes dancing with him in the living room, playing soccer with him, and going together to the swimming pool. She often comes to his school to discuss Julien's progress. However, Julien's school achievements deteriorate. At school the mother tells the teacher that she does not know what the problem is. Julien secretly goes to his girlfriend's party. His parents go the girl's house to take him home. Julien's sister phones him to warn him that they are on their way. Julien hurries back home on his bike. The parents meet him, grab him and put him in the car, leaving his bike on the road. At home Julien is beaten by his mother. He alarms the police and tells that he may commit suicide. Four police officers arrive at the house. Reluctantly the mother lets them talk with him in a separate room. Julien does not fully speak out. The police check his arms and trunk for physical harm but do not see anything. They leave. Julien is punished by the removal of most of his possessions from his room, and by giving him limited access to his room. Julien gets an alarm gun from his schoolmates and threatens his mother with it. However, she is not impressed. Then he threatens her with a small knife, and she dares him to kill her. At last he stabs his mother. A scene already shown in flash-forward at the start of the film is repeated, in which somebody is taken on a stretcher from the house to an ambulance; now it turns out that it is the mother. A voice-over tells that she survives and does not blame her son.

Central Bowerhill is approximately 1.75 miles (2.75 km) south of Melksham town centre. Bowerhill has a sizable industrial estate to the west of its residential area. This industrial area had been developed from a former Royal Air Force training school, and is home to the Wiltshire Gymnastics Centre and the Christie Miller Leisure Centre. The German engineering company Knorr-Bremse Rail Systems (formerly Westinghouse Rail Systems) established large modern offices in Bowerhill in 2009, and in 2015 Herman Miller, American office furniture manufacturer, opened a factory and offices in a building designed by Sir Nicholas Grimshaw. Bowerhill has a population of approximately 3,000 inhabitants and is effectively a small satellite town of Melksham. In the first decade of the 21st century, residential developments such as Hunter's Meadow boosted Bowerhill's population further.  History  Bowerhill was a rural area until early in 1940 when work began on a new RAF station. In July the RAF School of Instrument Training moved here from Cranwell and later a branch of the RAF Armament School also moved here. In the following years other courses were run and in 1942 the Armament School moved out and was replaced by the RAF Electrical School from Hereford. Towards the end of the Second World War a large number of Royal Naval Air Service mechanics were trained here and many transport drivers also received instruction. After the war, RAF Melksham resumed its Electrical and Instrument courses and continued with these and other education programmes until the early 1970s. After the departure of the RAF, the site saw a mixture of industrial, commercial and residential use, with much development in the 1980s. Its history is remembered in the area's street names, many of which are taken from historical aircraft. These include Falcon Way, Lancaster Road and Fulmar Close. The local pub is called The Pilot, and was formerly named The Harrier. The village was bounded to the south by the GWR's Devizes Branch Line until its closure in 1966. The land formerly occupied by the railway began to be developed for new buildings in 2007.  Notable buildings  Woolmore farmhouse carries a date of 1631 and is Grade II* listed.  Amenities  Bowerhill has a primary school and a village hall. Bowerhill Sports Field (5.34 hectares) was part of the RAF training school. Melksham's secondary school, Melksham Oak, is close to Bowerhill on the other side of the A365 Melksham-Seend road.

It is located east of Basildon, between Pitsea and Thundersley. Pillboxes in the surrounding fields testify to its wartime role in defending the Thames Estuary which it overlooks. The place-name 'Bowers Gifford' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Bura, meaning 'cottages', from the Old English bur, in modern English bower. The 'Gifford' element relates to its lords of the manor.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.56. History The Giffards appear to have held the Manor of Bures Gifford as early as the reign of Edward I. In 1253, William Giffard, and Gundred his wife, were possessed of the advowson of the Church of S. Margaret de Bures; and in 1259 William Giffard is recorded as holding 100a of land in Bures, by the Sergeancy of making the King's lard or bacon, whenever he should be in England; and that he also held the Hundred of Barstable of the King for £16, and one mark, and used before to pay the King £18. In 1281, King Edward I, in exchange for the Bailyship of the Hundred-and-Half of Barstable, confirmed to William Gifford and Robert his son, and Gundred the wife of the said Robert, in fee, the Manor of Bowers, quit and exempt of the ancient fee farm, reserving view of frankpledge and other liberties of the same; reserving also to the said Robert the fairs and profits of his market in Horingdon (Horndon), with some other exemptions, and fine warren.

Van Surdam played college football at Wesleyan University from 1902 to 1905. Van Surdam then served as the head football coach at Marietta College in 1906 and 1907, at Sewanee in 1908, at the El Paso Military Institute from 1909 to 1912, and at the Texas School of Mines (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso) in 1920, compiling a career record of 22–8–3. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972. Early years Van Surdam was born in 1881 in Hoosick Falls, a village in upstate New York. His father was a bandleader, and Harry began playing with his father's band at age 12. After graduating from high school in 1898, Van Surdam attended the Michigan Military Academy on a music scholarship. He also played clarinet with the Detroit City Band in 1901. He next received a music scholarship at Wesleyan University in Connecticut and enrolled there in the fall of 1901. He played football at Wesleyan under head coach Howard R. Reiter who has been credited by some with the development of the overhand spiral forward pass. Van Surdam played halfback and end on Reiter's 1903 team and was the quarterback of the 1904 and 1905 teams. As a senior in 1904, he was selected as an All-New England quarterback. He returned to Wesleyan in the fall of 1905 for post-graduate study in chemistry, and he led the 1905 Wesleyan football team to a 7–2–1 record. Van Surdam was also a member of the school's track team and glee club.. At Wesleyan, he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. Van Surdam worked in 1906 as a metallurgical chemist for Westinghouse Laboratories in New York City and taught at the Choate School in Connecticut in 1907. Coaching career=Marietta Van Surdam was the head coach of the football team at Marietta College in Ohio for the 1906 and 1907 seasons. Van Surdam's 1906 Marietta team compiled a 9–1 record, and his 1907 team went 7–2. Coaching at a small school, he made do with only 13 players and no assistant coaches. He later recalled: \\"I remember my team in Marietta had 13 men. It was rough on them when we had to play two games in two days. My pay there was $400 a year and there were no assistants or scouts to help.\\" The forward pass became legal in 1906, and Van Surdam was credited with being one of the first coaches to incorporate the new tactic during the 1906 season at Marietta. On November 29, 1906, Marietta's Petey Gilman threw a 52-yard pass that stood as the longest forward pass in college football until 1920. Van Surdam later described the play: > The passer had to stand back five yards and you could only throw flat > passes. Throwing down the middle was still illegal. We had a tailback > standing 12 yards back with two blockers in front of him. The quarterback > took the direct snap from center -- paused briefly -- and then passed back > to the tailback. Meanwhile the left end was streaking down the field. The > ball was pumpkin-shaped and you had to sling it side arm, but you could get > the job done. He recalled the reaction to the play: \\"When we threw it, the other team was dumbfounded. So were the referees. They were so confused they let it stand. Sewanee In 1908, Van Surdam coached the 1908 Sewanee Tigers football team to a 4–1–3 record. Sewanee was one of the major powers in the early years of Southern football, and Van Surdam's 1908 team defeated Georgia Tech (coached by John Heisman), played Vanderbilt (coached by Dan McGugin) to a 6–6 tie, and suffered its only loss in a close game with Auburn. At Sewanee, Van Surdam became friends with Grantland Rice with whom he later composed songs – Rice composing the lyrics and Van Surdam the music. El Paso Military Institute In 1908, after finishing the football season at Sewanee, Van Surdam was hired as an instructor at the El Paso Military Institute in El Paso, Texas. He developed the football program at the Institute and coached the team. Though he was in his later 20s, Van Surdam also played on occasion for the Institute's football team. He played quarterback for the 1909 Institute team that shut out New Mexico, 11-0, in 1909. With respect to his eligibility to participate as a player, he later explained: \\"There was no NCAA west of the Pecos.\\" In 1910, Van Surdam became the superintendent of the Institute. Van Surdam later recalled that he had took time off from the Institute to pursue Pancho Villa after his 1913-1914 campaign into Ciudad Juárez, across the river from El Paso. When Van Surdam returned to El Paso, the Institute had been closed, and he was out of work. (In 1914, the Institute ceased operation, and its campus became the Texas School of Mines, later renamed the University of Texas at El Paso.) Texas School of Mines Van Surdam returned to coaching in 1920 as the head football coach at the Texas School of Mines. He led the 1920 Miners to a 2-4 record. The season began with losses to Arizona (7-60), New Mexico (0-78), and New Mexico A&M; (7-12) and ended with victories over the Base Hospital (28-0) and Aviation Corps (3-0).

A mile north of the village, Godmond Hall is a 17th-century house incorporating a medieval pele tower.Godmond Hall at British Listed Buildings Online  History  Bowston has roots in the paper production industry, which made Cropper's Paper Mill at Burneside successful. In 1880 Bowston Mill, between Burneside and Cowan Head, was purchased by Cropper's. Bowston Mill may well have begun life as a fulling mill, but a new building was constructed to prepare rags and ropes for the other two mills. Bowston Mill was closed in the early 1960s when waste paper rather than rags came into use in the paper pulp. The mill has now been replaced by terraced housing running along the river's edge.History of James Cropper plc  Walking  Bowston is on the Dales Way which links Windermere in the west to Yorkshire in the East, making it a busy destination for walkers and climbers who follow this long-distance path.

Life Gallion was born in 1913 in Montgomery. He attended Lakeview Grammar School, Paul Hyne and Phillips High Schools in Birmingham. He was a member of the Presbyterian church. Gallion attended the University of Alabama from 1931 until 1937, when he received his law degree. He then began the practice of law. While a student, he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Gallion married his wife Velma Lee on July 10, 1942 in Oneonta. Together, they had a son and a daughter. During World War II, Gallion served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1942 until 1945. He rose to the rank of 1st Lieutenant and saw combat in the Central Pacific and was wounded at Saipan. After the war, Gallion served as a special counsel for the State of Alabama in the Phenix City trials. He served as the Chief Assistant Attorney General during the tenure of then-Attorney General John M. Patterson from 1955 to 1959. Gallion was a Mason. He was also a member of the Loyal Order of Moose, Elks and Woodmen of the World. He died on August 11, 2007. Attorney General of Alabama Gallion was elected Attorney General in 1958 as a Democrat for the 1959–1963 term of office. In-eligible to seek a second consecutive term in 1962, he opted to run for governor but lost the Democratic primary to George C. Wallace. He successfully sought re-election to his old office of Attorney General four years later in 1966. Prior to the 1970 elections, the state legislature changed the law allowing statewide elected officials to serve a second consecutive term. In what was considered an upset, he lost re-nomination in 1970 to Bill Baxley, then the Houston County District Attorney.WALLACE second to Gov Brewer in primary vote In the primary campaign, Baxley had successfully created a widely viewed public impression, whether accurate or not, that he himself would be a better ally of George Wallace. During his tenure as Attorney General, Gallion successfully led litigation that established Alabama's offshore oil and gas rights. This helped the state later establish what is now a multimillion-dollar trust fund.

He went to Framingham Academy before going to Harvard.Explore the historic past of beautiful Nantucket Island at this tranquil cemetery During his sophomore year in the winter of 1807-1808, he began teaching in nearby West Newton. The cobblestone Main Street in historic Downtown Nantucket After receiving his bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1810, Peirce went to Nantucket Island to take charge of a private school there, but after two years there, he returned to Harvard in 1810 to start divinity school, which he completed in 1815. He then returned to Nantucket where he resumed his teaching career. On April 1, 1816, in Nantucket, Cyrus Peirce married Harriet Coffin, (born June 26, 1794), the daughter of William Coffin, II, and Deborah Pinkham Coffin, his wife. They had no children. Career Cyrus Peirce left Nantucket to begin preaching in 1818 and was ordained a Unitarian minister in North Reading on May 19, 1819, and ministered there until May 19, 1827, when he resigned to take charge of a school in North Andover, where he stayed until 1831. In 1831, Cyrus Peirce returned to Nantucket and opened a \\"School for Young Ladies.\\" In 1832, fourteen-year-old Maria Mitchell, who later became a well-known astronomer, became one of his pupils. She eventually became his assistant, but left to start her own school on the island. In 1838 Cyrus Peirce became the first principal of Nantucket High School, but left in July 1839 at Horace Mann's behest to go to Lexington to become the first head (later called president) of the first public normal school in the country.http://www.prospecthillcemetery.com/index.php? s=milestones In an 1841 letter to Henry Barnard where he described his work in the Lexington Normal School, Peirce wrote: > You ask for a full account of my manner of instruction in the art of > Teaching. This, it is not easy to give. From what I say, you may get some > idea of what I attempt; and of the manner of it. Two things I have aimed at, > especially in this school. 1. To teach thoroughly the principles of the > several branches studied, so that the pupils may have a clear and full > understanding of them. 2nd, to teach the pupils by my own example, as well > as by precepts, the best way of teaching the same things effectually to > others. I have four different methods of recitation. 1st, by question and > answer; 2nd, by conversation; 3rd, by calling on one, two, three, more or > less, to give an analysis of the whole subject contained in the lesson, and > 4th, by requiring written analyses in which the ideas of the author are > stated in the language of the pupil.

By 1844 the school had moved to West Newton and Peirce was persuaded to return for another term in July 1844. He served until May 1849, when ill health again forced him to resign. While at the school, he closed each class with the call for them to \\"Live to the Truth\\". His words are the motto of today's Framingham State University, which has acknowledged him as its first president. Soon after leaving his post at the normal school, Cyrus Peirce left for Europe where he was a delegate to the third International Peace Congress in 1849 and toured the continent and England before returning to West Newton. Later life After returning from Europe in 1850, Cyrus Peirce became involved with Nathaniel Topliff Allen (1823–1903) in Allen's Academy in West Newton. After the normal school moved to Framingham in 1853, the academy took over its buildings which were located on Washington Street, where the First Unitarian Society in Newton now stands. Ill health again forced Peirce to retire but he remained associated with the academy until his death. Cyrus Peirce died on April 5, 1860, in West Newton and is buried in Section TT, Lot 148 in Prospect Hill Cemetery in Nantucket. His monument was erected by the students of the normal school and consists of a Celtic cross inscribed with the motto he had chosen for the school: \\"Live to the Truth.\\" Harriet Peirce died on September 29, 1884 and is buried next to her husband.

Its data centers are located in Texas, Chicago, Kansas City, Virginia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Hong Kong. Rackspace became public in 2008, and in 2016 was purchased and taken private by Apollo Global Management LLC. In June 2020 it changed its name to Rackspace Technology. Then in August 2020, Rackspace Technology went public again under the symbol RXT on the NASDAQ market.  History  In 1996, Richard Yoo started a small Internet service provider called Cymitar Network Systems out of his garage apartment in San Antonio, Texas. The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and web hosting. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf. When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from California and joined the team in 1998. Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at Trinity University in San Antonio. Although the founders began as application developers for end-users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development–not hosting–but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its CEO. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its \\"Fanatical Support\\" offering to focus on service and support. On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor Norwest Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. George J. Still, Jr., Managing Partner at Norwest, subsequently joined the Board of Directors. The pre-2008 Rackspace Logo In 2008, Rackspace moved its headquarters from a building once occupied by Datapoint Corporation to the then-unoccupied Windsor Park Mall in Windcrest, Texas. Rackspace's Chairman, Graham Weston, owned the Montgomery Ward building in the mall until 2006 when it was sold to a developer. The city of Windcrest purchased south of the mall to create a residential and retail complex. The facility is located next to Roosevelt High School, and many Roosevelt students intern at Rackspace. Fortunes \\"Top 100 Best Companies to Work For 2008\\" placed Rackspace as the first year that Rackspace applied for consideration. The company was praised for its transparency. Regular \\"Open Book\\" meetings are held where the top level leaders share in-depth financial information with all employees. In 2011 and 2013, the company was named as one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune. On August 8, 2008, Rackspace opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\"RAX\\" after its initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised $187.5 million. The initial public offering included 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share. The IPO did not do well in the public market and lost about 20% of its initial price almost immediately. At around 3:45 PM CST December 18, 2009, Rackspace experienced an outage for customers using their Dallas–Fort Worth data center – including those of Rackspace Cloud. On September 8, 2010, Rackspace received national attention when they decided to discontinue providing web hosting service to one of their customers, Dove World Outreach Center. This was in reaction to Dove World's pastor Terry Jones' plan to burn several copies of the Qur'an on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Rackspace claims that this violated their company policy. This move came under criticism, notably from Terry Jones himself, who described it as an \\"indirect attack on our freedom of speech.\\" Others questioned the appropriateness of Rackspace's action, stating that there is \\"absolutely no reason for web hosts to have an editorial policy, and this only gives Jones more attention and makes him look more persecuted.\\" In August 2016, it was confirmed that Apollo Global Management had reached an agreement to buy the company for $4.3 billion. The sale was completed in November 2016 and Rackspace officially ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016. In May 2017, CEO Taylor Rhodes announced he was leaving the company on May 16 to work for a smaller private company in a different city. In May 2017, Rackspace named Joe Eazor as its new CEO. In April of 2019, the company named Kevin Jones as its new CEO. In June 2020 it changed its name to Rackspace Technology.  Acquisitions  On October 22, 2008, Rackspace announced it was purchasing cloud storage provider Jungle Disk and VPS provider SliceHost. On February 16, 2012, Rackspace acquired SharePoint911, a Microsoft SharePoint consulting company based in Cincinnati, Ohio. On May 25, 2017, Rackspace announced an agreement to acquire TriCore Solutions. On September 11, 2017, Rackspace announced plans to acquire Datapipe.

Involvement with other companies  Rackspace launched ServerBeach in San Antonio in January 2003 as a lower-cost alternative for dedicated servers designed for technology hobbyists who want flexibility and reliability. Richard Yoo was a catalyst in the startup of ServerBeach. A bandwidth and colocation provider, Peer 1 Hosting now known as Cogeco Peer 1, purchased ServerBeach in October 2004 for $7.5 Million. Peer 1 Hosting entered the UK managed hosting market in January 2009 and the ServerBeach brand now competes directly with the UK arm of Rackspace, run by Dominic Monkhouse, former managing director of Rackspace Limited. In October 2006, Mosso Inc. was launched, which experimented with white-labeling hosting services. Eventually, the division became the foundation for the Rackspace Cloud Computing offering. On October 1, 2007, Rackspace acquired Webmail.us, a private e-mail hosting firm located in Blacksburg, VA. Originally branded as Mailtrust on May 20, 2009, it became part of the newly formed Cloud Office division of Rackspace. On October 22, 2008, Rackspace acquired Slicehost, a provider of virtual servers and Jungle Disk, a provider of online backup software and services. Rackspace announced on March 8, 2017, plans for an expansion to its portfolio to include managed service for the Google Cloud Platform. The program began beta testing on July 18, 2017, with a planned full offering in late 2017. Rackspace partnered with Google in Customer Reliability Engineering, a group of Google Site Reliability Engineers, to ensure cloud applications \\"run with the same speed and reliability as some of Google's most widely-used products\\".  OpenStack  In 2010, Rackspace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component. In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. This change introduced a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking. In 2015, two Rackspace executives were elected to the board of the OpenStack Foundation.Mike W. Thomas, \\"OpenStack Foundation adds two Rackspace execs to board of directors\\" San Antonio Business Journal January 20, 2015 In a February 2016 interview, CTO John Engates stated that Rackspace uses OpenStack to power their public and private cloud.

He was selected as an All-American center in 1921, played on the 1926 World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals, and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. University of Michigan Born in Toledo, Ohio, Vick graduated from Toledo Scott High School. He attended the University of Michigan where he lettered four years in football (1918–1921) and two years in baseball (1921–1922). Football As a 180-pound freshman in 1918, Vick was permitted to play varsity football under the Students' Army Training Corps rule in effect during World War I. He was named to a number of All-Western teams as a freshman in 1918. In 1919, owing to \\"the lack of backfield material\\" in Ann Arbor, Vick was moved to the fullback position. After being laid up with a foot blister in Michigan's early games, Vick built a reputation as \\"a star line plunger\\" who was \\"fast for his weight.\\" In 1920, Vick was moved back to the center position, where he was Michigan's starter in 1920 and 1921. Michigan's Coach Fielding H. Yost said of Vick: \\"He is the most accurate passer from center that has ever put a ball into play. Under pressure he was dependable at all times.\\" Vick was named to Walter Camp's All-American team in 1921. Camp said of Vick: \\"He is the only man who has throughout the season added great power and aggressiveness to steadiness and consistency.\\" After exception was taken by many to Camp's selection of Vick, Michigan's Harry Kipke wrote a column in the Lansing State Journal defending the selection. Kipke wrote: > \\"Vick is the greatest lineman Michigan has had since the days of \\"Germany\\" > Schultze. He is good on the offense and even greater on the defense. He has > studied football and knows the game from all angles. His defensive work is > the best that has been seen on the western gridirons in years. … He is a > rough, rugged and dependable man to have in the pivot position.\\" Kipke noted that Coach Yost had so much confidence in Vick that he would often ask Vick's opinion on plays and players. Kipke said, \\"When as great a coach as Yost takes in his confidence one of the men playing on his team, he must be far superior to any player on the eleven.\\" After Vick's selection as an All- American, newspapers across the country published articles about his unusual practice schedule. Vick enrolled in Michigan's medical school in the fall of 1921, and the heavy load of classes and study prevented him from practicing with the team. A substitute ran through the signals at practice each night, but Vick donned his uniform and played the center position on game days. Under the headline \\"All-American Center Played Only Seven Hours in 1921,\\" The Bridgeport Telegram noted: > \\"Allowing that there were seven conference games on Michigan's grid schedule > in the fall, it can safely be said that 'Ernie' did not play more than that > number of hours during the entire season.\\" (\\"Ernie Vick due to a heavy > scholastic schedule during his senior year at Michigan did not practice one > minute with the team, yet appeared in every game, never needed a substitute > or a time out and was chosen All-American center.\\") Press accounts praised Vick for \\"his absolute dependability in passing the ball, coupled with his almost superhuman defensive play.\\" It was also reported that, despite his lack of practice time, Vick \\"never had one minute of time taken out,\\" and was never \\"credited with a bad pass to a back field man.\\" The Michigan Alumnus devoted more than a page to Vick after his selection as an All-American, including the following: > \\"Followers of football at Michigan did not doubt Vick's supremacy as a > centre. … Vick was unquestionably the mainstay of the line. There was hardly > a play that he did not get into. It is admitted that there was not a better > lineman in the West at diagnosing a play, and when the play was completed > Vick usually emerged from the mass of men who had stopped the formation.\\" After Vick graduated from Michigan, sports columnist Billy Evans wrote, \\"The name Vick will live long in the memory of those who like Big Ten football. Michigan will always remember his great work.\\" Baseball Vick as U of M baseball coach in 1922. Vick also played on Michigan's baseball team, as a catcher, in 1921 and 1922. During Vick's two seasons on the Michigan baseball team, they had a record of 42-10. Vick proved himself to be \\"a great baseball player\\" and was considered the best catcher in the Big Ten in 1921. At the conclusion of the 1921 season, the team voted unanimously to elect Vick as the captain of the 1922 Woverines baseball team. Vick had been set to join the St. Louis Cardinals in 1922, but opted to stay for his senior year after being selected as the team's captain. Former Michigan baseball coach Branch Rickey had seen Vick's ability and reportedly kept a contract ready for Vick to sign \\"any time he desires.\\" Vick ended his athletic career at Michigan with the conclusion of the baseball season in June 1922. Professional athlete=Baseball As soon as the college baseball season had ended, Vick signed with the St. Louis Cardinals and joined the team in Boston on June 5, 1922. He made his Major League debut on June 29, 1922, but spent most of the 1922 season playing for the Cardinals' affiliate in the American Association at Syracuse. Vick batted .320 with Syracuse in 1922. In the spring of 1923, Vick played with the Houston Buffs, and did not play in any Major League games during the 1923 season. In 1924, Vick appeared in 16 games for the Cardinals and compiled a .348 batting average and .423 on-base percentage. After the 1925 season, columnist Billy Evans wrote that Vick was an \\"excellent baseball prospect,\\" but injuries had \\"kept him from proving his real worth as a big leaguer.\\" His most serious injury was \\"a badly shattered thumb\\" that threatened to end his career. In 1926, Vick appeared in 24 games for the Cardinals team that won the 1926 World Series. Vick was best known in baseball as the catcher for Grover Cleveland Alexander. Vick played in his last Major League game on September 25, 1926. In April 1927, Vick refused to follow the Cardinals' orders and report to Houston in the Texas League, and was sold to Indianapolis in the American Association. In four seasons with the Cardinals, Vick appeared in 57 Major League games, compiling 26 hits in 112 at-bats for a .232 batting average with 7 RBI and scoring 12 runs. In 1958, when Vick visited the Baseball Hall of Fame, a New York newspaper reported that he was wearing a 1926 World Series ring that had been on his finger for 32 years. The paper reported that there was \\"a twinkle in his eyes\\" when he saw his picture in the team photo of the 1926 Cardinals, seated in the front row with Billy Southworth, Bob O'Farrell and Grover Cleveland Alexander. When he arrived at the plaque of his former teammate, Rogers Hornsby, Vick remarked, \\"This is a great moment in my life. Rajah, the greatest hitter in all National League history, and, maybe including the American League.\\" Football In 1922 and 1923, Vick returned to Ann Arbor after baseball season ended. He served there as a line coach for the football team under Fielding H. Yost in 1922 and George Little in 1923.http://www.bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1922fbt.htmhttp://www.bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1923fbt.htm During his coaching days, Vick published an article about proper technique for centers in which he described the center as \\"the mainspring of the football machine.\\" He noted there were two ways of passing the ball to the backfield—the spiral or end-over-end. Vick wrote that he preferred the end- over-end, because he was a more accurate passer that way. In October 1925, Vick told a reporter that he loved football and enjoyed coaching, but he had decided to sever his connection with football as a means of making a living. Vick complained that the salaries paid by the western schools was insufficient to make it worthwhile. In 1925, Vick decided not to return to Ann Arbor and instead signed to play professional football with the Detroit Panthers. He played in 10 games for the Panthers in 1925. With Vick playing at center, the 1925 Panthers finished with a record of 8-2-2, allowing only 39 points on defense—2nd best in the NFL. In 1927, Vick signed with George Halas's Chicago Bears team. Vick was secured by the Bears after the Panthers fell \\"on the financial rocks.\\" Vick played in 10 games for the 1927 Bears team. In 1928, Vick split the season between the Bears and the Detroit Wolverines, playing one game for Chicago and six for Detroit. Big Ten official and manufacturer's representative In February 1929, Vick signed a contract to serve as an umpire in the Piedmont League. And in the fall of 1929, Vick was working as a bond salesman in Michigan, but also signed up to serve as an assistant football coach under Bud Daugherty at Albion College. Vick later worked as a football official for the Big Ten Conference. He spent 22 years working games for the conference before retiring in 1953. He also officiated in baseball games and worked the Rose Bowl game and other important post- season contests. He also worked as a manufacturer's representative before retiring in 1959. Vick died in July 1980, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

It tells the story of a widowed, unlikely policeman investigating a rape and murder of a schoolgirl in rural France. His slow investigation is interspersed with everyday scenes of his quiet life. The film is shot with little dialogue in a contemplative and symbolical style. The policeman is named after a famous French painter, Pharaon de Winter, who was from the place the film is set. Plot In the far north of France, filmed in Bailleul, a girl of 11 has been raped and murdered as she walked to her parents' remote farm from the school bus. Called onto the case, the mentally disabled Inspector Pharaon de Winter feels extreme revulsion. After having lost his wife and child in an accident, he now lives quietly with his widowed mother. At the weekend his neighbour Domino, who is sympathetic to his deeply affected state, asks him to join her and her lover Joseph, a bus driver. They go to the seaside and to a restaurant, but the reserved Pharaon finds Joseph ignorant and coarse. The police investigation moves slowly, with Pharaon looking into possibilities such as whether the murderer was a bus driver or a psychiatric patient. Noting that the murder site could be seen from Eurostar trains, he goes to London to interview passengers. But with no firm lead, the case is taken over by the Lille police. The factory where Domino works goes on strike and the police, led by Pharaon, have to quell a demonstration. Though outwardly angry, in fact Domino admires his quiet determination and offers herself to him. However, he rejects her advances, finding them too vulgar, and his mother warns her off. Then the Lille police arrest Joseph. When Pharaon gets to the police station, he finds him beaten up and weeping. At first baffled, Pharaon is soon surprised to find Joseph confessing in tears. Being a man of deep feeling, Pharaon comforts him, caressing him with his nose and kissing him on the mouth. When he goes home, his mother is out and Domino is at the kitchen table weeping. He comforts her. The final shot shows Pharaon sitting in a chair in his office at the police station, staring out the window, with handcuffs visibly shackling his wrists.

He went on to coach at clubs including Scunthorpe, Sheffield United and Aston Villa, where he was manager from 1964 to 1967. Playing career Taylor was born in Wolverhampton, and began his career as an amateur with hometown club Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his debut in the First Division with Grimsby Town in the 1938–39 season, but his career was disrupted by the Second World War. He moved on to Scunthorpe United, then playing in the Midland League, in 1948 when he was already 30 years old, and played regular first-team football for five seasons, which included the club's first three years in the Football League. According to a Scunthorpe United match programme feature, he was \\"the old fashion centre half, brilliant in the air, accurate in his passing and cool in the tackle. Nothing frustrated him\\". Coaching career After retiring as a player he joined Scunthorpe's coaching staff, moving on to Sheffield United in 1956 to work under Joe Mercer, and two years later joined Aston Villa as Mercer's assistant. He took over as manager late in the 1963–64 season after Mercer resigned due to ill-health, and succeeded in avoiding relegation, which resulted in him being handed the job on a full-time basis. The following two seasons saw little improvement in form, leading Taylor to invest heavily in new players for the 1966–67 season. Unfortunately his investment failed disastrously, resulting in them being relegated to the Second Division of English football and plunging the club deep into financial trouble. It was only the third time Aston Villa had been relegated in the club's history. Taylor was sacked not long afterwards, and subsequently ran a sports shop near the club's Villa Park stadium.

It is often considered to be a subspecies of the saker falcon (Falco cherrug). It used to have a high reputation among Central Asian falconers. It is uncertain whether the bird is a saker subspecies or a hybrid. Distribution and taxonomy The Altai falcon breeds in a relatively small area of Central Asia across the Altai and Sayan Mountains. This area overlaps with the much larger breeding area of the saker falcon (Falco cherrug). It appears that Altai falcons are either natural hybrids between sakers and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus), or rather the descendants of such rare hybrids backcrossing into the large population of sakers. So far, molecular genetic studies cannot prove or falsify the hybrid hypothesis. Gyrfalcons are rare winter vagrants to the Altai falcon's range. The high altitude cold grasslands of the region constitute habitat intermediate between typical saker habitat (temperate lowland steppes) and typical gyrfalcon habitat (arctic tundra). These two species of falcons also easily hybridise in captivity. Thus the Altai falcon is tentatively considered to be a saker subspecies Falco cherrug altaicus. It tends to be larger than typical sakers and has red-backed, brownish and greyish colour varieties. Literature * Almásy Gy 1903. Vándor-utam Ázsia szívébe.

History and toponymy The A30 London-Land's End road used to pass through Zelah until 1992 when a bypass was built south of the village to divert the trunk road away from the \\"High Road\\" that ran through the village. This typical ridge road runs from Carland Cross to Chiverton with barrows and burial cemeteries along its length gives some idea of the age of this old way. The public house in Zelah is an old coaching inn named The Hawkins Arms in the 19th century in honour of a descendant of the West Country seafarer Sir Richard Hawkins who gave it patronage. E. R. Kelly's Directory of Cornwall lists two public houses in the village in the 1883 edition and shows on the map both The Hawkins Arms – licensee Mr John Borlase and just behind to the east the Half-Moon Public House – licensee John Jose. This second pub stood right up to the turn of the century until it was demolished along with a wheelwrights smithy (one of three in the village at that time – the two others being blacksmiths) and a larger barn in the Hawkins car park nearby. The old pub site is now occupied by Half Moon House.(Kelly's Directory of Cornwall; 1883. London: Kelly & Co.)

Plot Joan Burrows (Bettis) returns to her hometown of Ovid, Colorado to attend her niece Olympia's (Blanton) high school graduation, but finds herself confronted by her past in the town. Before the graduation is to occur, a young couple goes missing and within a few days a mutilated body is found in the water during a town fish festival. This initiates flashbacks in which Joan's dark past is learned. When Joan was 17, she and her best friend were kidnapped and tortured by a serial killer named Bishop (Cotton). Bishop bound Joan and her friend to an autopsy table where one girl was tortured while the other had the power to make it stop simply by demanding the death of the friend. Joan was able to escape and kill her captor, but was left as the sole survivor of the spree with a scar on her cheek. With the present day's body count rising, questions arise whether Bishop has evaded death or if a copycat killer has arisen. Cast *Angela Bettis ... Joan Burrows *Kirby Bliss Blanton ...

Principal Production The production office opened on September 5, 2006 and had a scheduled 25 days of shooting in Calgary, Alberta, Canada beginning October 3, 2006. Despite the use of 3-D an early review by Fangoria.com explains that the 3-D \\"doesn’t overshadow the film, which would be just as effective without it; instead of tossing in over-the-top, in-your-face FX like those seen in Jaws 3-D and Friday the 13th Part III, SCAR's dimensional cinematography encourages a subtler, more voyeuristic feel\\". All-digital workflow Scar is the first feature length narrative 3D movie be completed in a completely digital workflow. The production workflow was designed by NHK and DitlevFilms. Using a 3D camera rig engineered by NTS in Japan (built around two digital high definition Sony cameras) the all-digital workflow was supported by an on-site digital lab. The lab facilitated an HD offline version of the footage so editing could begin while filming. The lab also generated dailies and full resolution plates for VFX. Postproduction The editing process of Scar was done entirely in HD (720p) and was using an editing method that allowed both stereoscopic video streams to be cut and viewed simultaneously. Proprietary scripts were used to generate 3D previews using a DepthQ 3D projector and CrystalEyes3 glasses. The postproduction process was designed and implemented by Christian Ditlev Bruun (DitlevFilms) and included FotoKem, Technicolor, and Plaster City in Los Angeles. Final stereoscopic adjustments were done in Skip City in Kawaguchi, Japan with NTS (a division of NHK). Reviews and buzz According to early reviews at one instance a man was \\"out cold and paramedics were actually called\\" and \\"one viewer ran out of the theater and threw up\\". Release On May 19, 2007 Scar3D opened at the Cannes Film Market. It has been the #1 film at the box office in several countries around the world, including Russia where it opened in 3D on 296 screens.

It forms part of the District of Sedgemoor, and is north east of Bridgwater, south east of Burnham on Sea and west of Glastonbury. At the 2011 census it had a population of 2,115. History The village name means the settlement of Hunlaf's people and was known as Hunlavintone in the Domesday Book of 1086. The parish of Woolvington was part of the Whitley Hundred, Close to the village is the Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater, a factory which produced high explosives for munitions from 1941 until its closure in 2008. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St Mary has 11th-century origins and is a Grade I listed building. In the early 12th century it was granted to Goldcliff Priory in Monmouthshire by its founder Robert de Chandos who was lord of the manor of Woolavington. In the 15th century it passed to the cannons of Windsor.

The impoundment of water behind the dam forms the Nechako Reservoir, which is also commonly known as the Ootsa Lake Reservoir. The dam was constructed to power an aluminum smelter in Kitimat, British Columbia by Alcan (now Rio Tinto Alcan), although in the late 1980s the company increased their economic activity by selling excess electricity across North America. The development of the dam caused various environmental problems along with the displacement of the Cheslatta T'En First Nation, whose traditional land was flooded. History=Selection of the dam site Following the Second World War, the Canadian government invited the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) to explore the potential of various sites around the country for hydroelectric power generation. British Columbia was particularly interested in attracting the aluminum industry. Premier Byron Johnson introduced special legislation authorizing the provincial cabinet to do what it thought necessary to establish a new aluminum industry in BC. For its part, Alcan was concerned with locating its energy-intensive aluminum smelters in close proximity to an inexpensive source of hydroelectric power. Chilko Lake in the Chilcotin region was the original proposed site for the Kenney Dam, but due to preliminary calculations by Fisheries and Oceans Canada showing that the Chilko Lake held up to three-quarters of the Fraser River's total sockeye salmon spawned in the region, the provincial government eliminated the site from the proposal. In 1948, following feasibility studies, Alcan decided to pursue a project on the Nechako River to power a large aluminum smelter to be located at the new townsite of Kitimat. A public opinion poll taken in 1949 indicated that an overwhelming majority of British Columbians supported the Alcan's plans for hydroelectric development on the Nechako. Support was not universal, however: for example, the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission objected to the use of a salmon river for power. Alcan had originally proposed that the BC government build the dam and the company buy the electricity from the province, but the government declined. Instead, Alcan signed the Kemano I agreement with the province on December 29, 1950 which granted the company rights to divert water from the Nechako above the dam and Nanika River downstream of Nanika Falls, permission to dam the Nechako and divert a portion of the original flow through a tunnel to a hydroelectric facility at Kemano, tax exemptions, and favourable water rental rates. Alcan also received timber rights and mineral rights on the Crown land that was flooded, and was given the opportunity to purchase land for the townsite of Kitimat at a rate of $1.60 per acre. Construction and technical specifications Construction of the dam and its associated facilities began in 1951 and continued until 1967, although the dam became operational in 1954. The dam, located in the Canyon of the Nechako River, is a rock-filled, clay-core dam measuring 97 metres high and 457 metres wide (at the top). Construction involved over 3 million cubic metres of material.Nechako Canyon Protected Area BC Parks. Accessed 9 March 2012. Concrete was injected in bedrock fissures below the dam to stabilize the foundation.Reservoir and Dam Royal BC Museum. Accessed: 16 February 2012. Until the W. A. C. Bennett Dam was built on the Peace River in the 1960s, the Kenney Dam was the largest rockfill dam in the world. The dam was named for the Hon. Edward Tourtellotte Kenney, then-Minister of Lands and Forests in the government of Premier Byron Johnson. Behind the dam, the Nechako Reservoir filled from 1952 to 1957, flooding a series of lakes in the drainage basin of the upper Nechako River. The water of the reservoir filled an area of 92,000 hectares.Reservoir and Dam Royal BC Museum'. Accessed: 16 February 2012. However, the level of the reservoir can vary by more than 3 metres depending on rainfall and power generation needs. The dam, which sits at the east end of the reservoir, forms part of a hydroelectric complex which also includes the Skins Lake spillway, which regulates water levels both in the reservoir and downstream. On the west side of the reservoir, a long intake tunnel running through the Coast Mountain range brings water to penstocks for a The tunnel Royal BC Museum. Accessed: 16 February 2012. vertical drop to the 8 units of the 890-MW Kemano Generating Station. The basic design of the Kenney Dam-Kemano power station inspired a similar development in Quebec. The Bersimis-1 generating station, built between 1953 and 1956 by Hydro-Québec, shares many features with Alcan's project. Concurrent with the hydroelectric development of the Nechako, the Alcan smelter, and townsite of Kitimat were created. Relocation of the Cheslatta T'En=Flooding of First Nations land At the request of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and Department of Indian Affairs (DIA), the Murray Dam and the Skins spillway were constructed across the Cheslatta River to help cool water temperatures in the upper Nechako River in order to minimize the impact on salmon spawning from the development of the Kenney Dam. As a result of the discharged water from the Murray Dam and the spillway, the traditional lands which had been home to the Cheslatta T'En people for at least 10,000 years, were flooded and caused the relocation of approximately 200 Cheslatta people. Villages were demolished and burned prior to the flooding with most families unable to return to collect their belongings and as water levels rose, it has been noted that coffins and skeletons from their traditional grave sites were washed away with skeletal remains being allegedly found in and around Cheslatta Lake. Relocation and compensation The Cheslatta T'En people were given approximately 10 days notice before they were relocated to live in overcrowded tents at a temporary location 30 miles north of their reserves in Grassy Plains. They were responsible for transporting their own belongings by means of wagons and consequently were forced to leave most of their traditional possessions behind. After months of living in poor conditions at the temporary location sites, the Cheslatta people were eventually resettled on marginal farms scattered over large areas, which proved disconcerting for this once close- knit community. According to DIA documents, the Cheslatta people asked for $108,000 in compensation along with payments for their new land, traplines and monthly pensions, however requests were denied and claims were dismissed. Payments in the form of money were demanded for their new land and any constructional improvements within their community. The Cheslatta people were compensated an average of $77/hectare with no payment covering moving expenses, compared to non-native individuals who received relocation compensation of $1,544/hectare along with covered moving expenses. It was only a year after the Murray Dam was constructed that the band members received their compensation payments. The Cheslatta people were also regulated on where to hunt and when to fish which combined with the land payments forced many people to seek welfare benefits. Their traditional practices became increasingly difficult as they were forced to conform to a new way of living and consequently death tolls rose from tuberculosis, suicide and alcoholism as a result of their poor living conditions. Requests for assistance in health care, education and housing were denied until 1964 when the relocation sites were officially turned into federal reserves. DIA records show unanimous support by the Cheslatta people for the surrender of their territory, however many band members state that no formal assent was conducted and the signatures on documents are forged by Indian affairs officials. It is also widely debated whether or not the legal rights of the Cheslatta people were presented as many claim that they were unaware of their power to refuse the requests of the Government of British Columbia, along with their ability to have a third-party advisor. The Cheslatta people also claimed that Alcan had assured them most grave sites would be unaffected by rising water levels, however any grave sites running the risk of inundation would be transferred to higher grounds and the Cheslatta would be informed. Alcan, however, claimed that the Cheslatta had agreed to flooding the grave sites, so long as two recent graves were moved and commemorative markers were placed above the flood waters. In accordance with this understanding, Alcan moved two graves while the rest of the grave markers were burned. Subsequent settlements In 1990, the Cheslatta filed a $122 million court case against the Canadian government over DIA fraud, duress and breach of trust, however the case was settled out of court for slightly less than $7 million. In 1998, Members of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation filed a Statement of Claim with the Supreme Court of British Columbia disputing all agreements and licenses issued to Alcan by the Federal and Provincial governments. The appeal was dismissed in Alcan's favour with no further legal actions in effect. On January 30, 2012, Rio Tinto Alcan finalized the transfer of approximately 11,000 acres of land to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation. The Cheslatta received the land as a form of freehold ownership with an estimated value of $1.2 million  Environmental impacts  Construction of the dam involved flooding 32,000 acres of land in order to create the Nechako Reservoir. This flooding impacted surrounding agricultural land and caused the loss of 8.7 million cubic meters of timber. The reservoir also disrupted existing ecosystems, and impacted animals such as beavers, Canada geese, ducks, moose, and about 100 trumpeter swans, equivalent to one eighth of Canada's swan population. The Nechako Reservoir took four years to fill, during these four year there was no flow running from the Nechako Reservoir for 50 miles between the dam and the Nautley River. The fish left in this section of the river remained trapped and died. Local animals that relied on that section of the river were also forced to migrate. In the first two years of operation, smelter emissions from the new Aluminum plant in Kitimat were believed to have caused further forest depletion, health problems for local workers, and harm on aquatic ecosystems.Environment Canada. Threats to Water Availability in Canada, (Ottawa: Minister of Public Works and Government Canada, 2004), 4.  Impacts on fisheries  Although there was a general public acceptance of the proposed hydroelectric dam and smelter plant in the Fraser River region, the fisheries sector was outspoken about the dam's potential effects on salmon reproductive patterns. Hydroelectric development in the region was seen in the media as being disruptive to important Fraser salmon spawning areas. There were limitations to long-term streamflow and ecosystems data in the Fraser River and its tributaries, which has made specific impacts of river diversion hard to evaluate.Environment Canada, 4. The staff at the IPSFC and the DFO surveyed the Nechako River and discovered that the loss of salmon spawning grounds would not be the main threat to sockeye populations in dam construction. Rather, it was the diversion of the river's natural flow that would cause the most impact to the sockeye population. Research showed that because of the massive amount of water to be transmitted to the coast, there would be a loss of water during the spring and summer months, causing reduced flow. Close to 100 percent of the river's estimated mean annual flow was diverted into the reservoir during the four- year period. 627 million cubic feet of water were withdrawn from the river daily. Therefore, the Nechako riverbed would be affected, as well as causing a rise in water temperatures, which would make summer migration for salmon more difficult. In the process of dam development, water temperatures exceeded 20 degrees Celsius, and the safest levels for sockeye salmon is 14 degrees Celsius.International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission. Potential Effects of the Kemano Completion Project on Fraser River Sockeye and Pink Salmon. (New Westminster), 3. Although the Nechako River temperatures became too high, the dam reservoir water temperatures were too low, and contained too high of levels of nitrogen and not enough oxygen for salmon. Due to these concerns, the DFO asked Alcan to assist the river's flow during the summer months. Eventually both parties agreed to an extra spillway on Cheslatta Lake that would promote the natural flow of the river during these dry periods. The Cheslatta, a tributary of the Nechako, would hold a spillway and reservoir to supply the water needed in sockeye migration during the summer months. The river regained between 60 and 70 percent of flow, three years after the spillway was implemented. Economic impact=Energy export Starting in the 1960s, Alcan was no longer producing energy solely for Kitimat's aluminum smelter. The company had begun selling the extra energy produced by the Kenney Dam to BC Hydro, a publicly owned company. By 1968, Alcan was producing enough energy to allow BC Hydro to delay their proposed $100 million project by 10 years. BC Hydro's proposed project would improve the power transmission system from Prince George and Smithers and it would extend the transmission system further to Terrace. In 1978, when the project went forward, Alcan was able to run energy directly into the province's power grid. Because the BC Hydro grid is linked to the North American grid, Alcan began selling energy to Alberta and the United States. In order to meet the energy demands in its new market, Alcan began diverting more water into its reservoir, resulting in lower water levels in the Nechako River. The decrease in water levels provided an increase the water temperatures. By 1980 water temperatures in the Nechako River had risen above what Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) consider to be safe for migrating and spawning salmon. In response to the DFO studies, the federal government asked Alcan to increase water flow from the Nechako Reservoir into the river, but Alcan declined. This led to the \\"constitutional battle\\" over who controls the flow of water in the Nechako River. Kemano Completion Project In the late 1970s Alcan announced the Kemano Completion Project. The project would construct a second tunnel from the Nechako Reservoir to Kemano, where four more power generators would be built. Controversies began in 1980, starting with the DFO and the federal government when they realized Alcan was going to go ahead with the Kemano Completion project without addressing the existing water level and temperature concerns. The proposed Kemano Completion Project would result in an additional 12% reduction in the Nechako River water levels. To avoid increased tensions Alcan accepted annual renewals of a court injunction setting water flows from 1980 until 1985, while the DFO performed studies on the potential effects on the Nechako's salmon population. In 1985, Alcan refused to consent to the renewal of the injunction, and DFO brought a claim against Alcan in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Both parties armed with their own scientists. While the trial was briefly commenced in 1987, it was ultimately settled out of court through negotiations involving Alcan, the provincial government and the federal government, resulting in the 1987 settlement agreement. Aspects of the agreement include: Alcan could build a cold water release valve in the Nechako Reservoir to cool the water temperature for migrating salmon and, in turn, release a smaller volume of water, and the company gave up its water rights to the Nanika River. In addition, the federal and provincial governments agreed to allow Alcan to proceed with a modified version of its completion project. Critics and opposition governments accused all three parties of not doing a proper environmental assessment. Alcan has not built the cold water release facility outlined in the 1987 settlement agreement, and as such has not reduced the amount of water released in to the Nechako water system. Studies showed that the water in the reservoir was too cold and contained too much nitrogen, while not enough oxygen. In order to create the correct balance, it was suggested that Alcan needed to draw water from both the centre and the surface of the reservoir, then run the water through \\"a hallow cone valve and over a baffle- clock spillway to reduce the amount of nitrogen\\". Second delays in the construction were due to a decrease in the demand of aluminum and a decrease in the economy. In the early 1990s there were increased objections to the completion project, both from the public and the newly elected NDP provincial government, and in 1993 the BC Utilities Commission was directed to conduct public hearings. The hearings began January 17, 1994. They looked at the design and construction of the plans for the facilities required for the completion project, hydrology impacts, fishery impacts, and the economic impacts for the people in the surrounding areas. In 1995, due to the potential and unresolved impacts on the salmon fishery, BC Premier Mike Harcourt announced the cancellation of the Kemano Completion Project. However, Alcan had already invested $1.3 billion in the Kemano Completion Project and in 1987 had been given permission to continue with the project. After two years of negotiations between Alcan and the BC government, the two parties signed the 1997 settlement agreement. Alcan committed to spending $50 million on a cold water release facility at Kenney Dam.Bruce Sheedy, Analysis of a Cold Water Release Facility in the Nechako Reservoir. (Burnaby, BC: Simon Fraser University Library, 2005), 1. In addition, the government paid Alcan $500 million for what the company had previously invested in the project.

He played college football at the University of Michigan in 1945, 1949 and 1950, and is most remembered for scoring the winning touchdown in the 1950 Snow Bowl game between Michigan and Ohio State. Early years Momsen was born in Toledo, Ohio in 1928. He was the son of Rose and Anton Momsen, Sr. He attended Toledo's Libbey High School where he was a star athlete in football, basketball and track. In 1944, he was selected as the first-team center on the Associated Press All-Ohio football team. In announcing the selection, the AP quoted an Ohio coach who said, \\"Momsen was one of the finest linebackers I have ever seen. He diagnoses plays rapidly, is extremely fast and a terrific tackler.\\" He was also an all-city and all-state basketball player. University of Michigan Momsen enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1945. In November 1945, when Michigan's starting center, Harold Watts, was transferred for additional Navy training, Momsen became a starter at center for the 1945 football team. After the 1945 season, Momsen withdrew from school. He entered the military. He also married and had two children. In 1947, he played football for Bob Snyder's Grills in the City Federation football league. In the winter of 1949, Momsen returned to the University of Michigan. Momsen played center and linebacker for the 1949 and 1950 Michigan football teams. Momsen is most remembered for his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State. The game matched Momsen against his younger brother, Robert \\"Buckeye Bob\\" Momsen, who was a starter for Ohio State. The game was played in a blizzard, with weather conditions so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The Buckeyes scored when Vic Janowicz kicked a field goal after Robert Momsen recovered a blocked Wolverine kick. With 47 seconds remaining in the first half, Tony Momsen blocked a Janowicz punt and fell on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. The Wolverines won by a final score of 9-3. Momsen, who scored the game's only touchdown was remembered as \\"the hero of a brilliant forward wall.\\" Bob Momsen later recalled, \\"Two brothers got more publicity for playing in a terrible football game than anyone ever deserves.\\" The win over Ohio State sent Michigan to the 1951 Rose Bowl against California. In the lead-up to the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Times gave credit to linement Roger Zatkoff and Momsen for leading Michigan's defense: \\"Zatkoff and Tony Momsen, the other backer- upper in Michigan's usual six-man line defense, are the main reasons why Michigan topped the Big Ten in throttling opponents.\\" Professional football Momsen was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the fifth round of the 1951 NFL Draft. He signed with the Rams in July 1951, but he was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers before the 1951 NFL season started. Momsen appeared in 11 games, all as a backup for the 1951 Steelers. In August 1952, Momsen was traded to the Washington Redskins. Momsen appeared in two games for the 1952 Redskins before being released on October 7, 1952. In 1953, Momsen played for the Calgary Stampeders of the Western Interprovincial Football League. In 1954, Momsen was in the Toronto Argonauts organization. He quit the Argonauts in August 1954 after being told he would play for the Argonauts' farm team. Later years After retiring from football, Momsen worked as a cement contractor and built customized golf clubs. He lived in Sunrise, Florida for the last 25 years of his life. In March 1994, he died at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, due to complications following hip replacement surgery. Three weeks after Momsen's death, Libbey High School announced that Momsen would be included among the initial inductess into the Libbey High School Hall of Fame.

Publication history The Everyman first appeared in Captain America #267 (Mar 1982) and was created by J. M. DeMatteis and Mike Zeck. He also appears in Marvel Team-Up #131-133 (July–September 1983). The character subsequently appears as Zeitgeist in Alpha Flight #78 (December 1989), and Captain America #390 (August 1991), #393 (October 1991), and #442 (August 1995), in which he is killed. Zeitgeist received an entry in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12 (2006). A new, female Everyman named Lauren Fai was introduced in the 2018 limited series Luke Cage - Marvel Digital Original. Fictional character biography Larry Ekler was the son of Milton Ekler, a hard-working lower class man who never gave up on the American dream, though he eventually died penniless. Larry decided that the American dream was a sham. Larry intended to take up the cause of the common man and start a revolution. To really start things going, he and his followers became determined to assassinate Captain America in public. Styling himself as a \\"defender of the people\\", Everyman sought to avenge his father's death on all of society. His primary weapon is a sword which can emit a lethal electrical shock. The Everyman challenged Captain America to a duel to the death at the Statue of Liberty. When he began to lose during the duel, Everyman took one of his own followers hostage, but that did not prevent Captain America from defeating him and taking him into custody.Captain America #267 Reed Richards, also known as Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four, had been a longtime friend of Milton Ekler. When Richards learned of Larry's madness, he decided to take responsibility for him. However, the hospital where Larry was incarcerated was actually run by Doctor Faustus, who manipulated Ekler in a plot to destroy Reed Richards. Faustus sent Ekler with a device to drain Richards' psychic energy, intelligence, and self-confidence. Richards met with Ekler, but was unprepared for the brutal assault and was stunned, the ray leaving him with only a normal intelligence level. Spider-Man - who had dropped in to visit the Baxter Building shortly after Larry's attack - was able to help Richards track down Ekler, but Ekler was aided in his struggle thanks to his use of the Absorbascan, a device provided by Faustus that the doctor had claimed would allow him to bond with the masses around him and draw on their raw strength. However, Richards was able to convince Ekler to leave when he revealed that Ekler's use of the Absorbascan was actually draining the life-energies of the people around him rather than forming a benevolent link to him like he had been informed. After his departure, Spider-Man was able to help Richards develop a machine that would restore his intellect to what it had been before.Marvel Team-Up #132 As Zeitgeist Faustus used his ties within the Secret Empire to furnish Ekler with a new secret identity, Zeitgeist. As Zeitgeist, he joined the German superhero group Schutz Heiliggruppe and was able to conceal his past from its members. He even helped the group battle Faustus' allies, the Red Skull and Arnim Zola. They also fought and defeated the Skeleton Crew.Captain America #387, 388, 390, 393 Despite his new heroic persona, Ekler's mission was to assassinate superhumans starting in South America. His victims included Captain Forsa, Defensor, La Bandera, the first Machete, El Condor, Ojo Macabra and Zona Rosa. Eventually, Zeitgeist's own team was called in to investigate the various murders. While fellow member of the Schutz Heiliggruppe Blitzkrieg was investigating, Zeitgeist killed him using the foil he once used as Everyman.Alpha Flight #78, Captain America #442 Zeitgeist attempted to convince Vormund, the leader of the Schutz Heiliggruppe, that the Scourge of the Underworld was responsible for the murders. He tried to kill his original foe, Captain America, but Captain America easily defeated him. As Ekler tried to escape, he encountered Vormund. The two fought and Vormund used his ability to redirect kinetic energy to impale Zeitgeist on his own sword.Captain America #442 Powers and abilities As the Everyman, Ekler wielded a sword which could fire blasts of energy, a shield, and the Absorbascann. As the Zeitgeist, he wielded a camera which could take pictures of people's deaths before they occurred, and a belt which could allow him to change appearances, and become invisible.

She was born in Tongeren, known as Tongres in French (which is why she is also called \\"Lutgardis of Tongres\\" or \\"Luitgard of Tonger(e)n\\"), and entered into religious orders at the age of twelve. During her life various miracles were attributed to her, and she is known to have experienced religious ecstasies. Her feast day is June 16. Life Lutgardis was born at Tongeren in 1182. She was admitted into the Benedictine monastery of St. Catherine near Sint-Truiden at the age of twelve, not because of a vocation but because her dowry had been lost in a failed business venture. She was attractive, fond of nice clothes and liked to enjoy herself. For Lutgarde, as for so many other women of her time, the cloister represented a socially acceptable alternative to the disgrace of unmarried life in the world. She lived in the convent for several years without having much interest in religious life. She could come and go as she pleased, and received visitors of both sexes.Staley, Tony. \\"From fancy clothes to visions and levitation\\", The Compass News, 11 June 2004, Diocese of Green Bay Wisconsin According to her Vita, it was in the parlour, a welcome break in the monotony of monastic observance, that she was visited with a vision of Jesus showing her his wounds, and at age twenty she made her solemn profession as a Benedictine nun. Some of the sisters predicted that her change in behavior would not last. Instead, she became even more devout. Over the next dozen years, she had many visions of Jesus, Mary and St. John the Evangelist. Robert Bellarmine relates a story that Pope Innocent III, when recently deceased, appeared to Lutgardis in her monastery to thank her for the prayers and sacrifices she had offered for him during his reign as Roman Pontiff. Accounts of her life state that she experienced ecstasies, levitated, and dripped blood from her forehead and hair when entranced. She refused the honor of serving as abbess. However, in 1205, she was chosen to be prioress of her community.\\"St. Lutgardis\\", Christ in the Desert Monastery In 1208, at Aywières (Awirs), near Liège, she joined the Cistercians, a stricter order, on the advice of her friend Christina the Astonishing. The nuns of Aywières spoke French, not Lutgarde’s native Flemish. Despite her efforts, she found the French tongue impossible to master. Living, working, and praying in the midst of her sisters she experienced a loneliness and solitude that she had never known before. Nonetheless, she contributed powerful images to the developing Christocentric mysticism.Wiethaus, Ulrike. \\"Luitgard of Aywieres\\", Key Figures in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia, ed. Richard K. Emmerson. Routledge, 2013 The prolific multiplication of Cistercian monasteries of women in the Low Countries obliged the White Nuns to turn to the newly founded friars, disciples of Francis and Dominic, rather than to their brother monks, for spiritual and sacramental assistance. Lutgarde was a friend and mother to the early Dominicans and Franciscans, supporting their preaching by her prayer and fasting, offering them hospitality, ever eager for news of their missions and spiritual conquests. Her first biographer relates that the friars named her mater praedicatorum, the mother of preachers.Kirby, Dom Mark Daniel. \\"Draw Me to Thy Piercèd Side\\", June 15, 2008, Silverstream Priory, Stamullen, County Meath, Ireland Lutgardis was one of the great precursors of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The first recorded mystic revelation of Christ's heart is that of St Lutgardis.Grassi, Joseph A., Healing the Heart: The Transformational Power of Biblical Heart Imagery, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010 According to Thomas Merton, Lutgardis \\"...entered upon the mystical life with a vision of the pierced Heart of the Saviour, and had concluded her mystical espousals with the Incarnate Word by an exchange of hearts with Him.\\"Merton, Thomas. What are These Wounds?: The Life of a Cistercian Mystic, Saint Lutgarde of Aywières, Clonmore and Reynolds Ltd., Dublin, 1948 When, in a visitation, Christ came to Lutgarde, offering her whatever gift of grace she should desire, she asked for a better grasp of Latin, that she might better understand the Word of God and lift her voice in choral praise. Christ granted her request and, after a few days, Lutgarde’s mind was flooded with the riches of psalms, antiphons, readings and responsories. However, a painful emptiness persisted. With disarming candour she returned to Christ, asking to return His gift, and wondering if she might, just possibly, exchange it for another. “And for what would you exchange it?” Christ asked. “Lord, said Lutgarde, I would exchange it for your Heart.” Christ then reached into Lutgarde and, removing her heart, replaced it with His own, at the same time hiding her heart within His breast. During this time she is known to have shown gifts of healing and prophecy, and was an adept at teaching the Gospels. She was blind for the last eleven years of her life, and died of natural causes at Aywières. According to tradition, she experienced a vision in which Christ informed her of her death. She died on June 16, 1246, the day after the Feast of the Holy Trinity, at the age of 64. Veneration Statue of Lutgardis on Charles Bridge St Lutgardis is considered one of the leading mystics of the 13th century. A life of Lutgardis, Vita Lutgardis, was composed less than two years after her death by Thomas of Cantimpre, a Dominican friar and a theologian of some ability. A Middle Dutch verse translation of this, the Leven van Lutgart, was produced in the second half of the 13th century and is now regarded as one of the canonical works of Dutch literature. Lutgardis was venerated at Aywières for centuries, and her relics were exhumed in the 16th century. On December 4, 1796, as a result of the French Revolution, her relics were sheltered at Ittre, where they remain.Farmer, David. \\"Lutgardis\\", Oxford Dictionary of Saints, 5th ed., Oxford University Press, 2011 Works of art depicting the saint include a baroque statue of Lutgardis by Matthias Braun on Charles Bridge in Prague and a painting by Goya. The statue on Charles Bridge (socha sv. Luitgardy) was sculpted by Braun in 1710 as a commission from Evžen Tyttl, the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Plasy. Patronage St. Lutgardis is the patron saint of the blind and physically disabled.\\"St. Lutgardis\\", Catholic News Agency In the 19th century, she was also taken as a patron of the Flemish movement because of her inability to speak Walloon.

The paper's editorial position is homeless advocacy. Vendors purchase the paper for 25 cents and sell them for $1 and keep the difference of 75 cents. The paper features alternative news, interviews, and poetry written by local journalists as well as the homeless and those who work with them. Street Roots is a member of the North American Street Newspaper Association and the International Network of Street Papers. History Street Roots was established in 1998. Israel Bayer was hired as executive director a few years later, and remained in that position for 15 years, performing numerous duties as he emerged as \\"one of Portland's leading moral authorities on homelessness,\\" according to coverage in the Willamette Week. He announced his departure in 2017. In 2007, it was described as the \\"most vocal opponent\\" of a proposed \\"sit-lie ordinance\\" championed by the Portland Business Alliance and then-Mayor Tom Potter. Its acceptance of a $30,000 grant from Street Access For Everyone (SAFE), at a time when its annual budget was $90,000, prompted concerns about editorial influence. The funding was designated for printing 10,000 resource guides that listed services for the homeless and an employee to assemble the guides. The executive director at the time of Street Roots Israel Bayer asserted the paper would not change its editorial position against the sit-lie ordinance. Kyle Chisek, a non-voting member of SAFE at the time announced the money wasn't intended to influence newspaper's editorial position. Chisek added that SAFE committee and Street Roots shared commitment to \\"providing a service for the homeless.\\" Initially, the city was concerned that this guide might be a duplicate of services already offered by the government and other non-profit agencies.

Uranium mining started as a byproduct of vanadium mining about 1900, became a byproduct of radium mining about 1910, then back to a byproduct of vanadium when the radium price fell in the 1920s. Utah saw a uranium boom in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but uranium mining declined in the 1980s. Since 2001 there has been a revival of interest in uranium mining, as a result of higher uranium prices. Uravan mineral belt Mine waste dumps (gray-green rock) at Shinarump Mine, northwest of Moab Mining of uranium-vanadium ore in southeast Utah goes back to the late 19th century, at the northern end of the Uravan mineral belt (see Uranium mining in Colorado), where it crosses into Grand County, Utah. Uranium occurs in the Salt Wash member of the Morrison Formation of Jurassic age. Because much of the value depended on the vanadium content, the only economic ore minerals were carnotite and tyuyamunite. Following World War II buying for nuclear weapons programs made uranium valuable for its own sake, and attracted hundreds of prospectors to southeast Utah.R.P. Fischer (1968) The uranium and vanadium deposits of the Colorado Plateau region, in Ore Deposits in the United States, 1933–1967, New York: American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, p.738. Lisbon Valley Geologic map of the Lisbon Valley area with key uranium mines numbered. The Mi Vida Mine is a red number 68. Uranium was discovered in sandstone of the Chinle Formation in Lisbon Valley, San Juan County in 1913, and some carnotite was mined on a small scale for vanadium in 1917, 1940, and 1941. In the uranium mining boom of 1948, mining began in sandstone of the Permian Cutler Formation. Then in 1952, Charles Steen drilled into a rich uraninite orebody in the Triassic Chinle Formation; that type of deposit became the largest producer in the district. Ore is distributed along of outcrop on the southwest side of the Lisbon valley anticline. The district produced of U3O8 (uranium oxide) through 1965.Hiram B. Wood (1969) Geology and Exploitation of Uranium Deposits in the Lisbon Valley Area, Utah, in Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933–1967, v.1, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.770-799. On November 4, 2016, a historical marker commemorating the Lisbon Valley's uranium heritage and noting Charlie Steen's discovery was dedicated on the Anticline Overlook road off U.S. 191. The marker was funded entirely by private donations. Artist Michael Ford Dunton created an arch to frame the historical marker and the view to the location of the Mi Vida mine, to the east of the marker.Marcello, Molly (27 October 2016). \\"New historical marker installed near Lisbon Valley mine site commemorates region's complex uranium heritage\\".

Uranium associated with copper mineralization at the White Canyon district was identified in 1920, but production did not begin until 1946. The geology is similar to that of the Monument Valley uranium district to the south which straddles the Utah/Arizona state line (see Uranium mining in Arizona). Uranium occurs in the Shinarump Member of the Triassic Chinle Formation. Primary ore minerals are uraninite and coffinite. Through 1965, the White Canyon district produced of U3O8.Roger C.

In 2009 White Canyon Uranium opened the Daneros underground mine, 40 miles west of Blanding in the White Canyon District, trucking ore to Denison Mines's White Mesa Mill. Daneros was the first new uranium mine permitted in Utah since the 1980s. In 2011 Denison took over White Canyon Uranium. In 2012 Energy Fuels acquired the Daneros mine from Denison. Energy Fuels produced from the Daneros mine until October 2012, at which time the mine was placed on standby, care, and maintenance. Marysvale district At the Marysvale district, in Piute and Sevier counties, uranium occurs in hydrothermal veins in igneous rocks (quartz monzonite, latite porphyry, and aplite). Primary uranium minerals are uraninite and umohoite, with associated gangue minerals pyrite, fluorite, quartz, and adularia.Paul F. Kerr and others (1957) Marysvale, Utah, Uranium Area, Geological Society of America, Special paper 64. Silver Reef district Uranium minerals were noted by 1881 in the silver mines at the Silver Reef/Harrisburg district, at Silver Reef, Washington County. No uranium was extracted until 1950, when a small shipment was made. The uranium occurs as carnotite along with copper mineralization and the silver mineral chlorargyrite in the Chinle Formation.Frederick Stugard Jr. (1951) Uranium Resources in the Silver Reef (Harrisburg) District, Washington County, Utah, US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 51-41. Uranium production has been minor. Yellow Chief mine Uranium was mined from tuffaceous conglomerate and sandstone of the Miocene Spor Mountain Formation at the Yellow Chief mine in the Thomas Range of Juab County.

It originates in the warmer parts of the old world, but now has spread with humans to other places. It is common in disturbed areas, especially in sandy soils. It has shown some weedy behaviour in restricted areas within southern Australia. Description The lesser jack tends to grow as a sprawling weed. The leaves are plain in shape, resembling spinach. The flowers of different sexes are clustered separately on the same plant. The plant produces many seeds with a hard, prickly casing. These are produced both in clusters along the branches and at the base of the stem. The root is thick and succulent. At the end of the plant's life, the root dries up and pulls the seeds at the base of the stem into the ground. The spiny, durable seeds make the plant a nuisance around human habitats, much like the similarly shaped seeds of Tribulus terrestris. Taxonomy Rumex spinosus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It was transferred to the genus Emex by Francisco Campderá in 1819.

Events in the confidence crisis included recalls on consumer goods such as pet food, toys, toothpaste and lipstick, and a ban on certain types of seafood. Also included were reports on the poor crash safety of Chinese automobiles, which were slated to enter the American and European markets in 2008. This created adverse consequences for the confidence in the safety and quality of mainland Chinese manufactured goods in the global economy. Pet food On March 15, 2007, a Canadian pet food manufacturer notified the US Food and Drug Administration that animals had died after eating its products. The next day, popular brands of pet food were withdrawn across the US while the FDA began its search for the cause. The prime suspect was contamination indicated by the presence of melamine, an industrial chemical found in plastics and resins. The FDA examined 210 samples of pet food and ingredients in six field laboratories. Of those, 130 tested positive for melamine either in the food itself or in wheat gluten used to thicken the gravy accompanying it. Researchers at Cornell University found crystals of melamine and cyanuric acid in urine and kidney tissue taken from dead cats, New Scientist reported. 'How melamine might have got into the pet food remains controversial,' the journal added. 'The FDA says it originated in wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate imported from mainland China that was added to the pet food by US manufacturers. American journalists have since reported that factory owners in China have admitted to routinely adding melamine to such products to boost their nitrogen content, and so make it appear that they contain more protein than they actually do. China explicitly banned this practice on April 26, 2007, though officials dispute any suggestion that melamine from their country could have been responsible for killing America's pets. Wilbur-Ellis In April 2007, animal feed provider Wilbur-Ellis Company issued a recall of rice protein it supplies to pet food companies because it may contain melamine. The rice protein was imported from Binzhou Futian Biology Technology Co. Ltd. in China, a company spokesman said. Toys= RC2 Corp  In June 2007, toy firm RC2 Corp recalled several of its Thomas & Friends wooden train sets because of the level of lead in the paint its Chinese contractor had used. In December 2007, the company recalled all of its The First Years 3-in-1 Flush and Sounds Potty Seats because a Chinese contractor had used orange paint that contained excessive levels of lead on the decorative plaques inserted into the back of the potty seat. Mattel In August 2007, millions of Chinese exported toys made by Mattel were recalled due to overdoses of lead paint. Such products include dolls, action figures, diecast cars, and Fisher Price products.  Bindeez  In November 2007, the Australian-distributed toy known there as Bindeez was voluntarily recalled. This was due to shipped toys which contained the toxic chemical 1,4-butanediol that sickened children when it metabolized into the anaesthetic GHB.  Marvel Toys  On November 9, 2007 around 175,000 Curious George Plush dolls were recalled by Marvel Toys of New York City, New York. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the dolls contained an excessive amount of lead in their surface paint.  Dolgencorp  On November 8, 2007 about 51,000 Children's Fashion Sunglasses imported from China were recalled due to dangerous levels of lead. The sunglasses were distributed by Dolgencorp Inc. of Goodlettsville, Tennessee and sold in Dollar General stores nationwide from March 2005 through October 2007. Personal care products= Gilchrist & Soames  On August 13, 2007 hotel amenity provider Gilchrist & Soames recalled Chinese-manufactured toothpaste sold under its namesake brand, because the toothpaste was contaminated with poisonous diethylene glycol. Gilchrist & Soames cooperated with the FDA in the recall.  EU RAPEX toothpaste recall  The EU's RAPEX rapid alert system had alerted member states' governments to pull two brands of Chinese-made toothpaste, Spearmint and Trileaf Spearmint, from European shelves after they were found to contain diethylene glycol, a constituent of antifreeze. Some Chinese manufacturers had been using it as a less-expensive substitute for glycerol, a safe ingredient commonly used to thicken toothpaste. EU consumer affairs commissioner Meglena Kuneva had said: \\"The RAPEX alert system has demonstrated its value in this case and has paved the way for a rapid EU-wide safety response prompted by the vigilance of the Spanish authorities\\". Tests on toothpaste found in Italy and Portugal had confirmed the results of Spain's tests, which had triggered the alert.Spain withdraws Chinese toothpaste from the oral care market CosmesticsDesigns.com. 12 July 2007.Accessed: 2007-09-05. The 'authorities in Panama, the Dominican Republic and Australia have found diethylene glycol, known to have been a source of a number of mass poisonings, usually from adulterated medicines, in toothpaste products', the paper added. Ultimate sanction On 10 July 2007, China executed the former head of its state food and drug administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, for dereliction of duty and taking 6.5m yuan (about US $850,000) in bribes from manufacturers of substandard medicines that had been blamed for several deaths. Zheng, who headed the agency between 1998 and 2005, had become the symbol of the quality control crisis in China's trade arising from the export of tainted goods, for some of which the authorities in Beijing had blamed him.. The sentence reflected Beijing's resolve to wipe out corruption and to ensure consumer safety, China Daily reported on 11 July, quoting the state Xinhua News Agency. \\"Zheng Xiaoyu's grave irresponsibility in pharmaceutical safety inspection and failure to conscientiously carry out his duties seriously damaged the interests of the state and people,\\" Xinhua had cited the high court as saying. A court in early July 2007 had handed down a suspended death sentence to one of Zheng's subordinates on the same charges, the paper added. And a third official at the agency was imprisoned after being convicted of taking bribes and illegally possessing a firearm. \\"The nest of corruption in the food and drug administration has done incalculable harm to the state and people,\\" China Daily quoted the Procuratorial Daily as saying. China was the world's largest exporter of consumer products, and tainted goods represented a small fraction of the country's exports worth more than one trillion US dollars each year. However, officials worried that protectionist forces in the US could use the spate of quality problems to restrict trade. As Zheng was being executed, representatives of the country's leading food and drug regulatory bodies were holding a joint news conference to emphasize their determination to crack down on fake and counterfeit food and medicine. After weeks of denying serious problems or accusing foreign forces of exaggerating the issue, officials have begun to strike a less defensive tone. One senior official acknowledged that the food and drug safety network still allowed too many unsafe goods to slip through and said that at the moment the trend \\"is not promising … As a developing country, China's current food and drug safety situation is not very satisfactory because supervision of food and drug safety started late. Its foundation is weak so the supervision of food and drug safety is not easy,\\" said Yan Jiangying, deputy policy director of the agency Zheng had headed. Chinese authorities also ordered copies of Time Magazine sold there to remove a story about tainted Chinese products. Apparently, other stories about faulty exports have been censored. Officials have argued that they have been \\"smeared\\" by media agencies and were planning to take retaliatory sanctions against Western nations. On August 11, 2007, Zhang Shuhong, co-owner of the Lee Der Toy Company, which supplied Mattel, was found dead at one of his factories. Chinese press reported that he had committed suicide by hanging. He left his factory littered with goods made for Mattel and its Fisher-Price division. Mattel at the time was the world's biggest toy company, and several weeks earlier had recalled toys based on Big Bird and Elmo from Sesame Street and Nickelodeon's Dora the Explorer, due to lead paint it blamed on Lee Der. Before hanging himself, he paid off all his 5,000 staff.

She served again during World War I in the dangerous North Atlantic Ocean, delivering general goods and ammunition to American Expeditionary Force troops in Europe.  Acquisition for Spanish–American War service  Celtic (AF-2) was built in 1891 by Workman, Clark and Co., Ltd., Belfast, Northern Ireland, as SS Celtic King; purchased by the Navy 14 May 1898; fitted out at New York Navy Yard; and commissioned 27 May 1898, Lieutenant Commander N. J. K. Patch in command.  Spanish–American War operations  From 11 June to 25 September 1898, Celtic supplied fleet units in Cuban and Florida waters with medical supplies, fresh provisions, and ice. On 12 October, she cleared New York to round Cape Horn on the long route to the Asiatic Station, arriving at Cavite, Philippine Islands, 30 March, for service as storeship. Supporting the quelling of the Philippine–American War, Celtic carried stores and passengers between the Philippines and Australian ports until 16 July 1903, when she weighed anchor for Puget Sound Navy Yard. Here she was out of commission between 18 September 1903 and 19 October 1905.  Relief and local operations  Returning to New York City 24 January 1906, Celtic began supply operations with the Atlantic fleet until 23 February 1907, when she again went out of commission. She was recommissioned at Boston Navy Yard 23 October 1908. At the suggestion of her commander, President Roosevelt ordered the Celtic to earthquake-damaged Sicily because she was already full of Christmas provisions, where she set up a tent city at Messina. She returned to her U.S. East Coast and Caribbean operations 15 April 1909. Key supply ship for the Veracruz operation, Celtic lay anchored off the Mexican city from 16 June 1914 to 24 July 1915, except for occasional voyages to Key West, Florida, and Cape Haitien, Haiti, for replenishment.  World War I operations  Her voyages carrying stores from New York to Caribbean forces ended 2 July 1917, when Celtic cleared New York to carry cargo to American bases at Queenstown, Ireland, and Brest, France. She returned to New York 27 August, carried parts of the 168th regiment to Belfast, Ireland in November, 1917 and then resumed her Caribbean runs until 1 July 1918. Transferred then to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, she crossed the Atlantic twice to English ports and once to the Adriatic with ammunition and stores.  Pacific Ocean operations  Reassigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet on 30 June 1919, Celtic cleared New York 31 August, arriving at San Pedro, California, 22 September. She cruised the west coast carrying and issuing stores to the Fleet until 22 March 1921, when she was assigned to duty as cold storage station ship at Apra, Guam. Celtic sailed from Guam on her last naval passage 17 May 1922, arriving at Cavite 26 May.  Post-war decommissioning  There she was decommissioned 23 June 1922, and sold 23 January 1923.

He played high school football at Kearny High School (San Diego, California), and college football at the University of Oregon. He was nicknamed \\"Yazoo\\" because he was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi. He was an All-American his senior year (1967), and was drafted in the first round of the 1968 NFL Draft. He was the first defensive back taken in the draft, and the twelfth player overall. He played all 14 games during his rookie season, but his career ended after one year because of a severe neck injury. After his career was cut short, Smith sued the NFL and the Redskins in federal court on the grounds that the draft was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. He argued that he would have gotten a better deal if he could have negotiated with all teams instead of just one. He also sued for personal injuries. Smith was awarded treble damages in the amount of $276,600. The Redskins paid him $50,000 for his first season, and an additional $19,800 for an option year on his rookie contract, for a total of $69,800. However, the district court found that he should have gotten a 3-year contract worth $162,200, like his free- agent veteran teammate Pat Fischer, who was also a defensive back. Smith's lawsuit was successful both at the federal district court level and appellate level and was eventually settled in 1979. In the meantime, the NFL agreed with the NFL Players Association to restructure the draft so it would no longer violate the antitrust laws. http://legendsrevealed.com/sports/2015/03/12/how- did-an-injured-rookie-nearly-destroy-the-nfl- draft/http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/593/1173/111224/ References Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:People from Yazoo City, Mississippi Category:American football defensive backs Category:Oregon Ducks football players Category:Washington Redskins players ","title":"Jim Smith (defensive back)"},{"id":"12757986","text":"The Rhode Island Gulls were a team in the United States Basketball League (USBL) based in Warwick, Rhode Island during the 1985 and 1987 seasons.

Code-switching in Hong Kong mainly concerns two grammatical systems: Cantonese and English. According to Matrix Language Frame Model, Cantonese, as the \\"matrix language\\", contributes bound morphemes, content and function words, whereas, English, the \\"embedded language\\", contributes lexical, phrases or compound words. Distinctions still exist, albeit subtle, among \\"Hong Kong English\\", \\"borrowing\\", \\"code-mixing\\" and \\"code-switching\\". The definition of Hong Kong English is controversial, as to whether it is a type of learner language or a new variety of English. Nevertheless, it belongs to the domain of English. \\"Borrowing\\" or \\"loanwords\\" refers to words taken from another languages after the process of phonological and morphological assimilation. Borrowed items are supposed to be so deeply entrenched into the base language that speakers are not always conscious of their foreign origin. \\"Code-mixing\\" and \\"code-switching\\", on the other hand, incur less integration into the base language and speakers sometimes are aware of the coexistence of two systems. Various units can be involved in the process, from single words to longer elements such as phrases and clauses. Early works on this phenomenon in Hong Kong reserve \\"code-mixing\\" for intra- sentential alternation between Cantonese and English and \\"code-switching\\" for the inter-sentential alternation. Nevertheless, \\"code-mixing\\" has been gradually stigmatised, implying the incompetence of the bilingual speakers in either or both languages. As a result, \\"code-switching\\" tends to be employed as the umbrella term for both alternations, although the intra-sentential mode is predominant among Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong Chinese. Code-switching, deemed as less formal than pure English or Cantonese, appears mostly in interaction between peers. Still, this phenomenon occurs in written media, including local magazines, popular entertainment books, columns in newspapers and advertisements, especially on technology or business administration related topics. Social background *The history of British colonisation and the tradition of bilingualism since then exert significant influence on linguistic situations in Hong Kong. (See Bilingualism in Hong Kong for more) * For individual Hong Kong people, even after the handover to the People's Republic of China in 1997, the status of English remains both a cultural and symbolic capital. The fact that they code-switch, continue to use traditional Chinese characters (along with Taiwan, Macau, and the Chinese diaspora), and accord high \\"prestige value\\" to English, signals the gesture of maintaining a separate identity from mainland China. Linguistic features of code-switching in Hong Kong=Phonetics/phonology Different segments of English words undergo phonological changes when mixed into Cantonese, affecting vowels, single initial and final consonants, initial and final consonant clusters. Stress of original codes is also subject to shift in some cases. Syntax The English elements engaged in the code-switching process are mostly of one or two words in length, and are usually content words that can fit into the surrounding Cantonese phrase fairly easily, like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and occasionally, adverbs. Examples are like: * 去canteen食飯 (heoi3 ken6-tin1 sik6 faan6, 'go to the canteen for lunch') * 好多嘢press你 (hou2 do1 je5 pet1 si4 nei5, 'A lot of things press you') * 我唔sure (ngo5 m4 su1-aa4, 'I'm not sure') * 幫我check一check啊 (bong1 ngo2 cek1 yat1 cek1 a1, \\"Help me search/check for it\\") Meanwhile, structure words like determiners, conjunctions and auxiliary verbs almost never appear alone in the predominantly Cantonese discourse, which explains the ungrammaticality of two節 (does not make sense, but literally means 'two parts'). English lexical items, on the other hand, are frequently assimilated into Cantonese grammar. For instances, * 兩part (loeng5 paat1, 'two parts'), \\"part\\" would lose its plural morpheme \\"s\\" as do its counterpart in Cantonese. * equip 咗 (ji6 kwip1 zo2, 'equipped'), \\"equip\\" is followed by a Cantonese perfective aspect marker. A more evident case of the syntactic assimilation would be where a negation marker is inserted into an English compound adjective or verb to form yes-no questions in Cantonese. * 佢可唔可愛呀？ (keoi5 ho2 m4 ho2 oi3 aa3, 'Is s/he lovely?') is pure Cantonese while a sentence like 佢cu唔cute啊？(keoi5 kiu1 m4 cute a1, 'Is he/she cute?') is a typical example of the assimilation. For English elements consisting of two words or more, they generally retain English grammar internally without disrupting the surrounding Cantonese grammar like, * 唔駛再搵part-time job啦 (m5 sai2 zoi3 wan2 paak1 taam1 zop1 laa3, 'You don't need to look for a part-time job again') (Examples are taken from the same source). Motivations The first major framework dichotomises motivations of code-switching in Hong Kong into \\"expedient mixing\\" and \\"orientational mixing\\". For expedient mixing, the speaker would turn to English (e.g., form) if the correspondent \\"low Cantonese\\" expression is not available and the existing \\"high Cantonese\\" expression (e.g., 表格 biu2 gaak3) sounds too formal. In the case of orientational mixing, despite the presence of both \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" expression (e.g., for \\"barbecue\\", there exists both 燒烤 siu1 haau1 in \\"high Cantonese\\" and 燒嘢食 siu2 je5 sik6 in \\"low Cantonese\\"), the speaker could still resort to English if the subject is perceived to be inherently more 'Western'. (K.K. Luke 1998: 145–159) (Lee J. 2012:165) The following list elaborates and summaries the distinction between English,\\"High Cantonese\\", \\"Low Cantonese\\" and Code-Switching. Taxonomy identifies four specific motivations, including euphemism, the principle of economy, specificity and bilingual punning. (The following examples come from the same source.) Euphemism The English counterpart is preferred if the speaker finds the explicit Cantonese expression culturally embarrassing, like breasts of females or open expression of personal feelings. Therefore, in the example of 透bra格格 (tau3 baa1 gaak3 gaak3, 'a princess whose bra is visible'), \\"bra\\" replaces its Cantonese counterparts. Principle of economy English is also preferred if it would require less linguistic effort in comparison with its Cantonese equivalent.Patrick Chun Kau Chu. (2007). Rules and Constraints of the Code- mixing patterns in Hong Kong Cantonese. Paper presented at the First International Free Linguistics Conference, Sydney, Australia, 6–7 October. Instead of code-switching and using \\"check-in\\" in expressions like 你check咗in未？(nei5 cek1 zo2 in6 mei6 aa3, 'Have you checked in yet?'), people will have to use the pure Cantonese expression 辦理登機手續 (baan6 lei5 dang1 gei1 sau2 zuk6), which contains six syllables. Specificity Proper names and technical terms are likely to appear in its original language, like \\"lock brake\\", \\"kick down\\", and \\"power shift\\" in auto magazines. English is either used to fill the lexical gap where generally accepted Chinese translation is unavailable, or to avoid confusion if one single English term has different versions of translation in Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Bilingual punning Bilingual punning makes the use of similarity in pronunciation between English and Cantonese to attract attention, especially for advertisements. In particular, 'fun' is frequently used as it forms almost complete homophonous with the Cantonese characters like 分 (fan1, 'point' or 'to share') and 紛 (fan1, 'many and various'). Examples include the slang of \\"high tech 揩嘢，low tech 撈嘢 (haai1 tek1 haai1 je5, lou1 tek1 lou1 je5, 'High Tech brings trouble while Low Tech is profitable')\\" and a promotion slogan of \\"英文多fun日 (jing1 man4*2 do1 fan1 jat6, 'A day having great fun/high mark with English')\\". In the extended version this taxonomy, \\"quotation in the original code\\", \\"doubling of the same expression in two codes for emphasis\\" and \\"English interjections inserted into Cantonese\\" are also included.

The Huasco River begins at the confluence of El Tránsito River and El Carmen River which is located in Junta del Carmen (790ma.s.l.).

The game can be played with 2 to 8 players but works best with 3 to 6 players. It is unknown how the game came to be called “bing” although it may be because of the mining terms: unit of weight equal to 800 pounds, or a pile of rich lead ore. It is probably the second definition that gives the game its name referring to the pile of coins that accumulate throughout the game; especially as it is the Galena lead mines that popularized the term “bing ore”. These mines opened in 1919 about the time the game was developed. Play The deck consists of two standard 52-card decks (no jokers) with deuces wild. The game starts with each person buying in for the agreed amount (traditionally 25 cents). Once the cards are shuffled, the player on the dealer's right “cuts for a deuce” viz. starts to cut the deck and if the bottom card of the top section is a deuce, the player can keep the card. This is not a true cut as the two sections do not exchange positions. Each player is dealt 14 cards. If the player on the dealer's right cut a deuce, he is only dealt 13 additional cards, skipping the first one making 14 total. The remaining cards are placed in a draw pile and the top card is turned over to start the discard pile. Play then begins with the player on the dealer's left. On his turn, a player has three choices: #Draw a card from the pile and then discard #Take the top card from the discard pile and then discard a different card #Meld Melding A player may not meld on the same turn in which they drew a card or picked up the card from the discard pile. This is different than other rummy games in which players draw/meld/discard all in the same turn. This distinctive element of bing is tricky for beginners too get used to. A meld consists of three or more cards in the same rank (e.g. 8s 8h 8s) or a run of three or more cards in the same suit (e.g. 5d 6d 7d). Deuces are wild. The first time an individual player melds, they must play at least three sets (e.g. Kd Kh Kc; 8c 9c 10c; 3h 3s 3h 3s). During their first meld or anytime thereafter, a player may play cards on any other meld on the table. In the above example, a player (provided that they melded their three sets to start) could also meld a king, a 7 of clubs or jack of clubs, or a 3. Since a player's meld does not score any points, those cards would be placed on the other player's meld. An important rule about melding is that a player cannot meld in such a way so that the cards left in their hand would put them over 75 points. For example, a player starts the hand with 63 points. They can only meld if they will have 12 or fewer points left in their hand. Moreover, whenever they draw/discard they must ensure their hand stays under 12 points. Scoring When a player has melded all 14 cards, the players count up the points in their hand with each card valued as its rank, face cards are 10 points (A hand with 6, Q, Q would be 26 points) and aces are 15 points (A hand with A, 3 would be 18 points). This total is added to the player's running score and if he finishes with a score of 76 or more he can buy in for the starting amount of cash, he would then have a score equal to the highest score of 75 or less. A player with less than 76 points wins when all the other players have 76 points or more. Example At the start of a hand players A, B, C and D have the following points:- A – 31 B – 5 C – 19 D – 47 In the next hand, players C goes out with the other players having the following deadwood counts:- A – 58, B – 6, D – 29. The new totals would be as follows: A – 31+58 = 89 B – 5+6 = 11 C – 19 D – 47+29 = 76 Players A and D both have 76 points or more and are out of the game, but if bing rummy is being played for money they could both choose to buy back in. They would then resume the game on 19 points in this example, that being the highest score among the remaining players in the game. Strategy There are three main strategies. # Early lay: As soon as a player can lay down three sets, he does so. This has the advantage that the player is rarely caught with a lot of points (they have five or fewer cards in their hand) but it does give other players more opportunities to play. If a player has a nine of hearts in their hand and another player melds 6h, 7h, 8h, the first player can now meld their nine. # Common: Most players hold off until they can play four sets. Typically this leaves two cards in the player's hand resulting in a low score. The major disadvantage of this method is that since a set cannot be made from two cards, this player is forced to play these cards on melds (either their own or other players’). # Sandbagging: This player attempts to play all 14 cards in one meld. Although a rare method, it can have its use under the right circumstances especially as the consequence for a person caught with a high score is merely the need to buy back in. Therefore, there is no fundamental difference for a player with a score 73 or 74 as to how many points they are caught with, but sandbagging may catch other players with many points in their hands – perhaps even winning the game (and the money). Since a player must draw a card and meld on two separate moves, an observant player using the common or sandbagging method may be able to dump points if they suspect a player will go out on the next turn. Since fourteen cards make four 3-card sets with two extra cards, a player almost always must play cards on other players’ melds.

It was based on the story of 3 girls: Prarthna, Sidhhi, and Sanskriti. Even though they all have different lives and a different outlook of life, destiny is not always on their side, and when the unexpected happens their dreams, hopes and desires come crashing down. Concept First, the story focuses on the lives and different belief systems of the three main protagonists - Prarthana, Siddhi and Sanskriti. Prarthana (Rati Pandey) is an orphan nurtured by her uncle and aunt. Her only desire is to have a traditional arranged marriage into a happy joint family. Prarthana hopes that one day she will walk into a house that is full of warmth and love. Prarthana's cousin Siddhi (Aanchal Anand) is a vibrant and independent girl who has lived abroad most of her life. Siddhi cannot understand the concept of an arranged marriage, nor can she tolerate being surrounded by people all the time. She believes that one must marry one's true love. Sanskriti (Amrita Prakash) is a model by profession, very straightforward and blunt in her attitude. Sanskriti can't understand the concept of marriage at all. She doesn’t believe that marriage can hold two people closer than love can. She vouches for a live-in relationship.

It was started in 2001 with NASA funding as a follow up to the General Earthquake Models (GEM) initiative. The multi-scale nature of earthquakes requires integrating data types and models to fully simulate and understand the earthquake process. QuakeSim is a computational framework for modeling and understanding earthquake and tectonic processes. QuakeSim focuses on modeling interseismic process though various boundary element, finite element, and analytical applications, which run on various platforms, including desktop and high-end computers. The QuakeTables database allows for modelers to access geological and geophysical data. A goal of QuakeSim is to develop significant improvements in earthquake forecast quality, thereby mitigating the danger from this natural hazard.  QuakeSim Portal  The QuakeSim Portal allows for users to access and ingest data into models and simulations. It provides the computational infrastructure for the entire project. QuakeSim users can create an account and interact with different data and software through the portal. The QuakeSim Portal consists of portlets that include: *Facilities for accessing real-time and archival GPS data *Time series analysis tools, including ST_Filter and RDAHMM *Mesh generation and viscoelastic finite element simulation tools (GeoFEST) *Okada-based elastic fault modeling methods (Disloc, which is a forward model, and Simplex for inverting geodetic data).  QuakeTables  QuakeTables is the database used to access information for QuakeSim. Information found in the QuakeTables includes: *Paleoseismic fault data *Global Positioning System (GPS) surface deformation data *Seismicity data *Processed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Interferograms from existing satellites This information plays a big role in the process of forecasting and damage mitigation. The information allows for the creation of simulations and data mining. This then improves the prediction for potential earthquakes. This, along with attenuation modeling and site effects, leads to a better understanding of probable ground motion, allowing for the opportunity to improve structural response. Figure 1. Process for estimating damage probability.  Developed Software  QuakeSim includes several applications. GeoFEST, PARK, and Virtual California are used to model different aspects of the earthquake cycle. For more information on these programs, and to download them, see the \\"Download Code\\" section of the QuakeSim website.  QuakeSim-related NASA missions  QuakeSim utilizes GPS data from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the US Geological Survey Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN). QuakeSim is also establishing the computational infrastructure for the planned NASA DESDynI mission.  DESDynI: Deformation, Ecosystem Structure, and Dynamics of Ice  DESDynI (pronounced destiny) is a dedicated US InSAR and LIDAR mission for studying hazards and global environmental change. The objectives of DESDynI are to: *Determine the likelihood of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides *Predict the response of ice sheets to climate change and impact on sea level *Characterize the effects of changing climate and land use on species habitats and carbon budget *Monitor the migration of fluids associated with hydrocarbon production and groundwater resources  Affiliates  * NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (lead) * Brown University * Indiana University * NASA Ames * University of California, Davis * University of California, Irvine * University of Southern California References  * DESDynI: Deformation, Ecosystem Structure, and Dynamics of Ice Monitoring Hazards And Environmental Changes From Space.

It was revealed that the character would discover she is the half-sister of Rhys, starting an incestuous relationship. Speaking of her character, Moynihan said: \\"I'm thrilled to be joining the cast of Hollyoaks and to be playing the character of enigmatic rock chick Beth. She's a quick-witted and independent young woman who loves indie and rock music as well as having a real lust for life.\\" She continued, \\"Beth's got some great storylines lined up and I'm looking forward to the viewers' reactions as both her character and relationship with Rhys develops.\\" A Channel 4 spokesperson also commented on Beth's upcoming storyline, saying: \\"Beth's going to be central to a massive autumn storyline for Hollyoaks which will turn certain characters' worlds upside down.\\" Storylines Beth first appears when she is run over by Rhys Ashworth whilst they are both on their way to purchase tickets to see a band. Beth is not injured, but discovers Rhys has bought the last tickets for himself. Rhys gives Beth a ticket, which belonged to his friend Gilly Roach. The pair swap numbers and begin to date. They quickly fall for each other. Rhys's family does not believe him when he tells them he has found a girlfriend. However, Beth begins to avoid Rhys. Unknown to Rhys, this is because her father has died. Rhys's father Noel Ashworth dies and Rhys attends the wake. Noel's brother Neville then introduces Rhys to Noel's daughter, Beth. Rhys and Beth avoid each other, and Rhys is angry, believing Beth had known all along that they were half siblings. He then tells her that he never wants to see her again. However, Beth soon begins at Hollyoaks Community College, despite applying for a transfer. Beth befriends fellow students, Zoe Carpenter and Kris Fisher, giving her a reason to stay in the village. Slowly, Rhys and Beth resolve their differences as Beth moves in with the Ashworths. The family throw her a birthday party to make her feel welcome. She becomes friends with her cousin Hannah Ashworth and they go on a double date with Gilly and Danny Valentine. Beth and Gilly eventually kiss and become a couple, which makes Rhys jealous.

Before they leave, Beth and Rhys admit their love for each other, despite knowing it is illegal. Beth and Gilly return from Thailand and are surprised to see Rhys has a new girlfriend, Mercedes McQueen. The following day, Rhys warns Beth that Gilly is planning to propose marriage to her. When Gilly proposes, Beth reluctantly agrees, despite continuing an affair with Rhys. Rhys and Beth decide to run away together, but Rhys realises his family need him. Beth becomes even more jealous of Rhys and Mercedes' relationship. Eventually Beth breaks down in front of Rhys, telling him she wants to be with him. As they kiss, they are both unaware that Mercedes' sister, Michaela McQueen is watching. Michaela confronts them. However, they tell her it is due to her drug habit. Angered, Michaela tells Gilly what she saw. However, he refuses to believe her. Despite this, he returns home, only to find Rhys and Beth in bed together. As the rest of the Ashworths return home, Gilly attacks Rhys and informs his family of his affair. Neville, Suzanne, Josh and Hannah are disgusted. Rhys and Beth are then thrown out of their home, having to move into the student accommodation. Beth and Rhys are questioned by the police and a court date is set.

Television and visual media=Early TV appearances *Jean Grey (as Marvel Girl) made her first ever animated appearance on the series The Marvel Super Heroes in the episode of The Sub-Mariner with the original X-Men line-up (Angel, Cyclops, Iceman and Beast). *Jean Grey appeared in Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends in a flashback in \\"The Origin of Iceman\\". X-Men Phoenix in the X-Men animated series. Jean Grey-Summers is a central character in the mid-1990s X-Men animated television series, voiced by Catherine Disher. As in the comics, she was in a relationship with Cyclops, eventually marrying Cyclops while being the target of Wolverine's unrequited affection. For the most part, she was a warm, friendly person who when necessary stepped in and played peace maker between Cyclops and Wolverine. As far as her relationship with Cyclops was concerned, they were very happy and content with each other, in stark contrast to Gambit and Rogue often fighting and bickering. The entire saga of the Phoenix is retold and adapted in season three, subdivided into the five-part \\"Phoenix Saga\\" in which Jean acquires the power of the Phoenix and the battle for the M'Kraan Crystal occurs, and the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\", showcasing the battle with the Hellfire Club, the Phoenix's transformation into Dark Phoenix (voiced by Tracey Moore), and the battle to decide her fate. These particular episodes are as close as the cartoon came to directly duplicating the comic book storylines – the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" is so accurate to the original stories that the episodes have the additional credit \\"Based on stories by Chris Claremont\\". She also appears in the 1990s Spider-Man: The Animated Series in first the fourth and fifth episodes of season two along with the rest of the X-Men. X-Men: Evolution Jean Grey in X-Men: Evolution. Jean Grey appears as a central character in the animated TV series X-Men: Evolution, voiced by Venus Terzo. She is a popular soccer player, and also teaches and trains the mutant students of Xavier Institute. She wears a black suit with green accent. Since she is a telepath, she's the one who operates Cerebro aside from Professor Xavier. When humans found out about the existence of mutants, Jean was accused of using her psionic powers for things that she successfully accomplished without using her powers, such as playing basketball in school. At one point, Jean lost control of her powers which caused her to be uncontrollably read people's minds telepathically. The X-Men were having a hard time trying to help her, but luckily Rogue was present and used her own powers to drain enough of Jean's energy for Scott to prompt her to focus on Scott. Jean has a fear of clowns, to which Mesmero uses this to take control of her mind, so she could do the villain's bidding. Jean's personality is cheerful, slightly tomboyish, short-tempered, with a sort-of jealous streak and some insecurity issues that would appear later in the series. She possesses the power of telekinesis and telepathy, initially only being able to move objects with her hand. She can remote-view others, be in psychic rapport with others and can tell if another speaks the truth. Later on, her telekinetic powers greatly strengthened and increased to the extent that she can now move multiple objects as heavy as a helicopter without effort and create psionic blasts that can render a person unconscious within a few seconds. She is capable of flight at high altitudes and with intense concentration can divert the water flowing from a dam while in flight. At the start of the series, she dated popular but unpleasant football player, Duncan Matthews while struggling with growing and strengthening love feelings for her longtime friend and teammate, Scott Summers. In the third season, Jean finally severed ties with Duncan and began a strong and close romantic relationship with Scott; after saving Scott from nearly being murdered by Mystique. When Professor X became Apocalypse's horseman, Jean fought her mentor mind-to-mind, after Apocalypse's defeat, Professor X had had a prophetic vision that Jean would eventually become possessed by the almighty Phoenix Force within her and become the X-Men's most terrible of enemies. Had the show continued with a fifth season, it probably would have focused on the Dark Phoenix saga. Wolverine and the X-Men Scott Summers in Wolverine and the X-Men. Jean Grey appears in Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Jennifer Hale, as a supporting character. After a mysterious explosion at the Institute, Jean was lost and the X-Men disbanded until Wolverine reformed the X-Men. Mr. Sinister fooled Cyclops in to thinking that Jean was in the villain's clutches but of course it was only a set-up. Unknown to anyone, Jean was in a hospital. When she finally awoke, the doctors asked for her name but she could not remember anything. Jean's past was revealed and she is shown in her teenage years being confronted by Magneto and Professor X, ultimately joining the X-Men, becoming part of the original five that included Angel, Iceman, Beast and Cyclops. Magneto then tried to force Jean to join by attacking the X-Men, but she fought and defeated Magneto, forcing the extremist to admit that she was much stronger than originally thought. Specifically, Jean prevented Magneto from crushing a visorless Cyclops with a bus and using her telekinetic powers to restrain Cyclops's optic beams, then telepathically guided Cyclops aiming at Magneto, blasting Magneto's helmet off; it was around this time that she apparently developed a romantic relationship with Scott Summers. After working at the Institute for a few years, Logan develops a huge romantic crush on her at first sight. Scott and Logan confront each other regarding this matter, which ended with Jean scolding Scott for lashing out at Wolverine. In the pilot, she is still shown berating Scott for poor behavior towards Wolverine and demands that Scott apologize. Back in the present time, Jean is being helped by the nurse Marjorie on trying to recall her name. Marjorie starts speaking name after name and would not stop even though Jean asked her to. Jean became confused and not realizing what she was doing, lost control of her telekinetic powers. This caught Emma Frost's attention when it registered on Cerebro and went to pick her up with Cyclops. Meanwhile, Jean is being chased by the MRD in the hospital and, once cornered, ratted out by Marjorie, she unintentionally manifested her enormously powerful Phoenix abilities in the heat of her fear and hopelessness, which caused an intense psionic wave that affected almost the entire city. Archangel, under Mr. Sinister's command, went to capture Jean but Cyclops and Emma intervened. They soon discovered that the reason why Jean was not in mental contact with Scott was because she had no memory of Scott. Archangel pursued them as they tried to get Jean home, Cyclops desperately fought him, but in the end both he and Jean were captured so that Sinister could take samples of their DNA for his experiments. The X-Men came to rescue them and fought the Marauders, but just as Archangel is about to kill Cyclops, Jean manifests her immensely powerful Phoenix Force abilities and defeats him. Scott was able to calm her down and take her to the Institute for rest and promised her that she would regain her memories in conjunction with Emma's help. Everyone at the institute then became unconscious, except Emma, an undercover agent of the Hellfire Club who now had Jean, and therefore the Phoenix Force itself, in their hands. The Hellfire Club was then able to claim Jean as one of their members. By using the combined telepathic powers of both Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos, they mentally tricked Jean into doing what they wanted by using images of Scott and Professor X. But the mental contact was interrupted by Scott's unusually strong psychic/telepathic connection to Jean. The Stepford Cuckoos then tried to release the Phoenix Force so they could be hosts, and seemingly succeeded. Emma was shocked when she learned the true purpose was for the Inner Circle to control the vastly limitless power and energy of the Phoenix when she originally thought that they were trying to release the Phoenix back into space to prevent the world from destruction. Jean and Cyclops then left to fight the Phoenix, but not before Jean angrily pinned Emma to the wall and telekinetically bound Emma with iron pipes after seeing Emma passionately kiss Cyclops (leading her to suspect that Emma may have plotted to steal Cyclops from her). Jean was unable to subdue the Phoenix herself, prompting Cyclops to attack the cosmic entity, only to be struck down as Jean watched in horror. Before the Phoenix could kill Cyclops, Emma, freed by Wolverine, arrived and took the Phoenix Force into herself, seemingly dying in the process by shattering into several diamond fragments. Jean has rejoined the X-Men and her memories have since returned and appeared to have reconciled with Cyclops. The Super Hero Squad Show Jean Grey appears in The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Hynden Walch. In the episode \\"Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy\\", she is the only cheerleader at X-Men academy. After she becomes a victim of Ringmaster, she still shows her peppy side in her cheers (Call me Phoenix, call me Jean. Red-haired, mutant, prom night queen. I'll rap you with a mental hurl, if you call me Marvel Girl! Go Mutants!), after she's done her cheer she uses the Phoenix Force and creates a heavy windstorm in the hallway to open the lockers and find a fractal while under Ringmaster's control. Oddly while the comic book cover intro for the episode shows Jean wearing a childlike version of her classic Phoenix costume, she wears a cheerleader uniform with a X-logo in the actual episode. She also makes an appearance in the episode \\"Ice Man Cometh\\" where she is telekinetically keeping the water from the melted ice caps from hitting the school. X-Men Anime Marvel Anime: X-Men. Jean Grey appears in Marvel Anime: X-Men, voiced by Yurika Hino in Japanese and again by Jennifer Hale in the English dub, at the beginning of the series, she is consumed by the Phoenix Force and nearly destroys the world with her tremendous strength and power, the X-Men engage in a brief battle with her, until she ultimately sacrifices herself to save the world, although she dies, she assists the X-Men with conflicts through a strong telepathic link in later episodes, such as saving Professor X from hallucinations and appears as the White Phoenix of the Crown, encouraging the X-Men to keep on fighting to save the world, she was in a strong and close romantic relationship with Cyclops, and had a necklace with a ruby stone with gold in the shape of a phoenix, which was a gift from Cyclops, the necklace was then given to Hisako as a sign that Cyclops can finally let Jean go, as he recognizes her sacrifice as a symbol of love for her friends and the world. Her Dark Phoenix persona is taken from X-Men: The Last Stand where her face is full of dark veins and her eyes become entirely black. Iron Man: Armored Adventures Jean Grey appears in Iron Man: Armored Adventures, with Venus Terzo reprising the role. In this series, she is under the alias Annie Claremont (a composite homage to her friend Annie Richardson's death that triggered her powers and Dark Phoenix Saga writer Chris Claremont). She temporarily enrolls in the same school Tony Stark, James Rhodes and Pepper Potts attend while looking for a special school for mutants in the area, and after telepathically learning about Tony and Rhodey's secret, she confides in them. Tony and Rhodes, after sympathizing with her, rush to her aid when she is kidnapped and coerced by Magneto to assassinate rabid anti-mutant politician Senator Kelly. After defeating Magneto with the help of her new friends, she is approached by Professor Charles Xavier offering her a place in the institute.  Film  Famke Janssen portrays Jean Grey/Phoenix in several X-Men feature films, while Sophie Turner portrays a younger depiction in the prequel film series.  X-Men  Jean is introduced in the first film as a doctor at Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted, as well as a speaker for mutants' rights. She unsuccessfully campaigns against Senator Robert Kelly's Mutant Registration Act. At the mansion, she is introduced to Logan/Wolverine who shows an attraction to her, which she seems to reciprocate, if slightly, due to her relationship with Scott Summers/Cyclops. She analyses Logan's skeleton and attempts to read his mind to uncover some of the memories. Later in the film, she treats Kelly himself after he is transformed into a mutant by Magneto's machine, though he dies soon after. She also fixes Cerebro, after Mystique sabotages it to injure Xavier, and makes the fateful choice to use the machine herself to find Rogue, though the experience drains her. In the film's climactic battle against the Brotherhood of Mutants, Jean and Storm battle Toad, though Jean is incapacitated when Toad spits solid slime in her face. She nearly suffocates but is saved by Cyclops. She later telepathically aids Cyclops in regaining his visor to defeat Sabretooth, and uses her telekinesis to guide Wolverine to Magneto's machine, freeing Rogue moments before Brotherhood's plan was accomplished. After Magneto's machine is destroyed, Jean appears to be visibly \\"shaken\\" by the energy emitted from it. Following the battle, while treating Logan again, Logan admits feelings for her; she attempts to turn them down politely, but Logan quickly changes the subject, while kissing her hand.  X2  Janssen's depiction continues to work at Xavier's School, while her powers have slowly been growing unstable since the battle at Liberty Island. Following an assassination attempt on the President by a mutant, Nightcrawler, Jean and Storm are sent by Xavier to track him down. They find him in an abandoned church and realise he was acting under mind control. After Colonel William Stryker attacks the school and most of the mutants are forced to flee, Logan contacts Jean to pick him, Rogue, Iceman and Pyro up in Boston; they arrive just after a fight with the police which leads to the air force chasing after the Blackbird. Despite Storm's best efforts at shaking the fighter jets, one is able to launch two target-locked missiles at the Blackbird. When the team realizes what has happened, Jean falls into a trance and taps into her increasing abilities with startling results: her hair blows back from her face, her skin flushes with an almost fire-like glow, and her eyes burn with red flames as she telekinetically destroys one of the missiles with apparent ease. Shocked at what she's done and exhausted by the sudden power fluctuation, Jean loses her control and the other missile hits the Blackbird. They are then saved by Magneto and Mystique, who offer their aid in stopping Stryker from using Xavier to kill all the world's mutants with a second Cerebro. While camping, Logan makes a pass at Jean, who gently turns him down. Logan is later seduced by Jean, though he discovers it was Mystique in disguise. As the X-Men storm Stryker's base on Alkali lake, Jean accompanies Magneto and Mystique to open the second Cerebro chamber, but Jean is forced to fight a brainwashed Cyclops. When Cyclops unleashes the full power of his optic blasts, a power that, according to Jean earlier could potentially \\"punch a hole through a mountain\\", Jean erects a psychic shield and once more unleashes the full extent of her power; her eyes once more burn red and a fiery corona of energy surrounds her as she blasts Cyclops away. The sheer force of the explosion of the two's powers causes a deep crack in the dam itself, and sends the two combatants flying across the room from each other. Jean's blast woke Scott from his trance, though she injures her leg. They reunite with their friends and discover that Magneto fooled Stryker's son, Jason, into manipulating Xavier to kill all humans instead of mutants, though they foil the plan. As they make their way back to the X-jet, the controls are damaged due to the base falling apart. Jean unleashes her fully developed powers: she begins to fix the Blackbird's technical problems, locks all forms of exit to prevent a rescue attempt from distracting her from what needs to be done even preventing Nightcrawler from teleporting to her, and telepathically possesses Professor Xavier in order to say goodbye to her loved ones. She then creates a massive psychic barrier and holds back the entire wave of Alkali Lake, all while lifting the repaired Blackbird out of harm's way. Jean's eyes burn red and her entire body is engulfed in powerful psychic flames as she uses the last of her power to fly her friends to safety before a look of complete peace engulfs her as she drops her hands, allowing the rushing water to finish its work and is apparently killed by the flood, devastating both Logan and Cyclops. However, at the end of the film, the shape of a phoenix is seen.  X-Men: The Last Stand  Famke Janssen as Jean Grey / Phoenix in X-Men: The Last Stand. Haley Ramm portrayed Jean's first meeting with Charles Xavier and Magneto is shown in a flashback taking place twenty years before the events of the first film. In the present day, the X-Men, particularly Scott and Logan, continue to mourn Jean's death. After hearing Jean's voice, Scott travels alone to Alkali lake, where he encounters Jean herself, having survived the flood. They kiss passionately, but Scott suddenly vanishes. Xavier senses it and sends Logan and Storm to Alkali, finding Jean unconscious but alive and taking her back to the mansion, where Xavier reveals to a shocked Logan that due to the instability of Jean's powers, he created psychic barriers inside her mind to prevent her alternate personality, the destructive Phoenix, from taking over. Jean awakens shortly after in front of Logan; they almost make love before Logan discovers she is not herself. Though Jean begs Logan to kill her, the Phoenix takes over and knocks Logan out before leaving the mansion for her childhood home. Both the X-Men and Brotherhood track her down; though Xavier attempts to placate Jean, the Phoenix takes over again and vaporises Xavier, destroying most of the house, and joins the Brotherhood under Magneto while still distrusting him. Jean, however, manages to psychically call for Logan, seeing him as the only one able stop the Phoenix. Logan goes after her but is defeated by Magneto. Jean witnesses the film's climactic battle sequence on Alcatraz Island between the X-Men and the military and the Brotherhood, but refuses to obey Magneto. After Magneto is defeated, Jean is almost pacified by Logan, but the military's reinforcements arrive and open fire on the X-Men, causing the Phoenix to resurface and devastate Alcatraz Island, wiping out the military and most of Magneto's army. Magneto and the X-Men escape while Logan stays behind to reach Jean, his healing factor keeping him from being vaporised completely. Jean temporarily regains control and begs Logan to save her; he stabs her fatally after telling her he loves her. She is buried on the school grounds next to the graves of Xavier and Scott.  The Wolverine  Logan continues to be haunted by dreams of his role in Jean's death. However, in the film's climax, after saving his new lover, Mariko Yashida from the Silver Samurai, Logan has a final vision of Jean in which he finally lets go of her while telling her that he will always love her.  X-Men: Days of Future Past  The time-displaced Wolverine encourages the young Charles Xavier to later recruit Jean for the future team, along with Ororo Munroe and Scott, arguing that the good they accomplished outweighs the bad they experienced. Commentary in the film confirms that the young red-haired girl's identity in the field who was marveling at Magneto levitating the Robert F. Kennedy stadium was in fact her character as a young child. When the timeline reset, Logan is astonished to discover that Jean and Cyclops are alive and well in the new timeline, suggesting that the events of the original X-Men films played out very differently.223x223px  X-Men: Apocalypse  A younger version of Jean, alongside teenage versions of Scott and Ororo, appears in X-Men: Apocalypse. Now blue-eyed with long, loosely curled orange hair, this new variation of Jean had been located and enrolled sometime prior to the movie, as she, now in her mid-teens, is introduced as already being a student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. When Alex Summers brings his younger brother to the school after his own optic laser blast powers had manifested, Scott bumped into Jean, as he couldn't see due to being blindfolded. Jean drops the many books, binders, and papers she held, but instantly we watch as this new incarnation of Jean telekinetically pulls them back into her hands, exhibiting seemingly little effort, which seems to imply that the Professor has left her mind unbarred. She gets mad at this, but apologizes as Scott explains he can't exactly look where he's going. Later, Jean is studying by a tree when Scott attempts to talk to her. Seeing the other students show fear, Jean explains that they're afraid of her because they are aware of her full powers, and therefore is treated as an outcast. Jean is affected by the energy wave released by an ancient, god-like mutant who had awakened that day. This causes Jean to have a nightmare of the world ending during which the entire school shakes, most of the students are awoken from sleep, and the Professor hurries to her room to find that her telekinetic powers, already immensely strong, are quite literally burning the walls of her room. Telepathically reaching into Jean's mind to awaken her - an act that causes Charles a sizeable amount of pain - the wooden walls cease to burn and to emit smoke, and the Professor slumps back, substantially exhausted now. The powerful young psychic is reassured by Xavier that she is not losing control of her powers, despite her doubts. When the mansion is destroyed, she comforts Scott over the loss of his own brother and conceals herself, Scott, and Nightcrawler from Stryker's men. While in Stryker's base, she connects with Weapon X (Wolverine) and releases him from his cell. Before he, fearfully, leaves the complex Jean restores the few remaining memories of his that she can. She then joins the fight in Cairo. She telekinetically protects the group from Angel's metal wings. After Xavier is saved, he mentally links with her and reveals to Apocalypse that he is not the most powerful psychic, and convinces Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers. Her eyes glowing with fiery light, the powerful young Mutant walks through midair and within a matter of seconds, a massive burst of telekinetic energy (combined with fire generated by Magneto piling metal into Apocalypses' shields) explode outward from within Jean's body, almost instantaneously taking the shape of a great, fiery bird. Her powerful telekinesis dispels Apocalypse's shield, and aided with Cyclops, Storm and Magneto, they weaken the Apocalypse altogether. Until finally, as she gets more powerful, the fire reaches to Apocalypse's physical body, and she incinerates Apocalypse before calming down. She helps to psychically restore and revive Professor Xavier. She is last seen helping to re-build the mansion, alongside Erik Lensherr, before joining Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Quicksilver, under the leadership of Hank and Raven, to become the new official team of X-Men and preparing to test her powers in her very first Danger Room session against a group of Mark I Sentinels.  Logan  Five years after the events of Days of Future Past, it is revealed that many of the X-Men, including Jean, have all been accidentally killed by Xavier's first telepathic seizure. In a deleted scene, while eating with the Munson family, Logan is asked if he has ever been married. In his grief, and not remembering what truly happened, but rather loosely interpreting the events of X-Men: The Last Stand from the original timeline, Xavier claims that Jean was Logan's wife whom Logan killed by accident. Logan laughs and claims Xavier is confused, but is still shown to be visibly shaken by Jean's death.  Deadpool 2  Deadpool 2 features an Easter egg to Jean Grey's alter-ego \\"Phoenix\\" with a moving truck company called \\"Phoenix Moving\\" in the film. She is absent from the X-Men's roster in their cameo, implying she hasn't returned yet since leaving Earth in 1992.  Dark Phoenix  Turner reprises her role in the 2019 film Dark Phoenix, which more faithfully adapts The Dark Phoenix Saga. Taking place in 1992, 9 years after X-Men: Apocalypse, the X-Men are hailed as national heroes thanks to their defeat of En Sabah Nur. However, the X-Men are going on more increasingly risky missions and during a rescue mission in space, the Phoenix inside Jean is unleashed after she is struck by a solar flare.

Marvel Ultimate Alliance series  Jean Grey appears in the Marvel: Ultimate Alliance series of games. * Phoenix appears in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Sarah Waits. She is a NPC for the every versions, but Game Boy Advance version where she is one of the strikers. In the primary gameplay versions, she is initially kidnapped by Arcade putting her under mind control and forces her to battle the player's team. After she is rescued, she assists the player's mission to rescue Nightcrawler from Mephisto's realm, only to be captured by Blackheart in the process. After defeating Blackheart, the player has the choice to save either Jean or Nightcrawler, since saving one results in the other's death. If Nightcrawler was rescued, then Jean will be resurrected by Mephisto (this will occur during the game). After you defeat Phoenix during the fight against Mephisto, Jean Grey-Summers dismisses herself as an echo of her past self and sacrifices her life to defeat Mephisto. In the end of the game, it is revealed if the player let Jean die, she will return as the Dark Phoenix and exact her revenge on those who did not save her. On a side note, she has special dialogue with Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Invisible Woman, and Cyclops. On the game's PC Version, Jean is available as a playable Mod character from Marvel Mods. There are several versions of Jean which give her different powersets. These include powersets from the 1990s, Morrison's Run, current Phoenix, Dark Phoenix, and Goblin Queen.

This game appears to retcon Jean and Nightcrawler's previous fates depends on the player's choices in the previous game. She can be unlocked by collecting 5 shards of the M'Kraan Crystal. Her default costume is her Phoenix costume. She uses telepathy, telekinesis, and the power of the Phoenix. Jean's alternate costume is her X-Men: First Class costume and she fits in the X-Men, Masters of Energy, Repentant Killers, Natural Leaders, and Femme Fatales team bonuses. Since she is a playable character in this game, her fate in the first game is non-canon. In the game she has a special conversation with Cable, however, this conversation is only available if you pick Anti-Registration in the game, it deals on their family relationship and the status on the Civil War. Jean also has the unique ability to possibly resurrect herself from the dead in both versions of the game. In-game, whenever Jean picks up an object the object hovers, giving the effect that Jean is holding the object with her tk. During her block, whenever she is hit by a projectile a telekinetic shield is partially visible. There is quite a difference in the PS2/PSP/Wii version of her and her Xbox 360/PS3 version. In the former, Jean's telekinesis and telepathy is in the form of her pink energy signature, along with some fiery powers, and most of the animations are completely from X-Men Legends II. She also harnesses the signature Phoenix raptor during fusions. In the latter version, all of Jean's powers are fiery energy, including her telekinesis and telepathy. No Phoenix Raptor is in this version of her. Jean is not playable in the DS Version. Jean also appears on the back of the MUA2 cover for all versions. For some reason on the back of the cover she possess the fiery mane type of hair that she had under the artistic work of Phil Jimenez and Greg Land, but in the actual game, she has straight hair. * Jean Grey returns as a downloadable playable character in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 3, this time goes by her well-known codename, Phoenix. Her Dark Phoenix form is the antagonist of the X-Men DLC pack where Jean is included alongside three other X-Men (Iceman, Gambit, and Cable). Jennifer Hale reprises her role from Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Wolverine and the X-Men and Marvel Anime: X-Men. Phoenix's default costume is her green and gold \\"Phoenix\\" costume, and her alternative costume is her red and gold \\"Dark Phoenix\\" costume. Phoenix's other costume includes her Marvel Girl costume. Phoenix's abilities in the game include a mixture of fiery abilities mixed with her telekinetic abilities. Phoenix is able to revive herself and other team members by using her ultimate attack.  Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  Jean Grey-Summers (under the name of \\"Phoenix\\") appears in the crossover fighting game Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds as a playable character, voiced once again by Jennifer Hale. She is widely considered to be one of, if not, the most powerful character in the game winning many major tournaments and being played by many high level players. She has the lowest vitality of any character in the game, a little less than half of the next lowest health characters, but compensates for this by having tremendous damage output. She can teleport at distances, use telekinesis for her throw attacks, and heal her red-damage life bar with Healing Field Level 1 hyper (by getting close to enemies). Her main projectile attack is TK Shot, a cosmic fireball that varies in speed depending on the button pressed. Her one and only offensive Hyper Combo is Phoenix Rage, where she shoots a huge cosmic Phoenix raptor at her enemy, heavily burning enemy at contact. If her lifebar is emptied with the Hyper Combo gauge at maximum (5), she will transform into Dark Phoenix. Although her health is completely restored upon turning into the Dark Phoenix, her life bar depletes at a steady rate. However, her attacks become more powerful, shoots out small projectile fire feathers with normal attacks, and the Hyper Combo gauge refills at a faster rate than normal. Phoenix sports four alternate color schemes based on her classic look, her early 1990s appearance drawn by Jim Lee, which shares similarities with her appearance in Chris Claremont's X-Men Forever, and her costumes from Greg Pak's X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong and Grant Morrison's New X-Men. Phoenix has two additional colours as well as a DLC costume in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The DLC costume is available in The Dead Rising Pack and it is her 1990s Jim Lee look. The pack was released on 22 November 2011 and was the first pack to be released. The pack also contains additional costumes for Ghost Rider, Frank West and Nemesis. In Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Phoenix has been toned down to reduce overall character use, but can still be very destructive in the right hands. Mods for the PC version of Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 have allowed for Jean to have more health in the game, with some modders giving Jean the highest health in the game. Although making her incredibly unbalanced, players are unable to play online with her this way and as a result, must play offline with her. Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite ''' Modders for the PC version of the game have allowed for Jean Grey to be playable. Albeit as a skin for Captain Marvel. Modders have used the models from the Marvel Heroes MMO to make this happen.  Toys  Jean Grey-Summers has appeared in several X-Men toy lines, including the popular Marvel Legends line. Her first figure appeared within the Shi'ar assortment of X-Men figures, with her wearing her green Phoenix costume and included an electronic light up hair and eyes feature. Eventually a Jean in her 1990s outfit was offered as part of an exclusive line called She-Force (Subsequently, the figure was only a repaint of a previous figure). Later, she was a part of the Onslaught assortment, this time wearing he blue and yellow costume that she wore for most of the 1990s, which was oddly preposed with very little articulation. Following this figure, she was a part of the X-Men Space Riders assortment, wearing a variation of her 1990s costume that also included added space suit parts. After this, a better looking, more articulated version of Jean in her 1990s outfit was designed and shown at Toyfair. Unfortunately, the line had later been canceled and the figure never saw release. In Marvel Legends series 6, she appeared in her Phoenix (green) costume, with a Dark Phoenix variant. The Phoenix figure was later re-released as part of the X-Men Classics Line. A figure of Jean Grey from X-Men: The Last Stand was released in the second series of Marvel Legends from Hasbro with a Dark Phoenix variant as well. A Phoenix figurine has also been released as part of the \\"Superhero Squad\\" line of non-articulated figurines. These small scale figurines depict famous Superheroes in \\"kiddie\\" variations. Phoenix is released as a two-pack with the brown and orange costumed Wolverine. A Dark Phoenix variant has also been released as a Toys 'R' Us exclusive boxset. A Phoenix toy was created based on the first X-Men movie. Three different variants were released. The first had her with an open top, no bra, and her hair down. The second had a redesigned head with her hair tied back, and a bra painted on underneath her open top. The third had the same tied back hair do, but the chest was redone and closed up, making it the most accurate of the three variations. A Jean Grey-Summers figure was also created as part of Toy Biz's Famous Covers assortment. The figure depicted her in her blue and yellow 1990s outfit. Jean Grey is the eleventh figurine in the Classic Marvel Figurine Collection.  Other Media  Jean Grey is recast as Julia Ash in The Refrigerator Monologues. Julia has difficulty maintaining any kid of daily life in Deadtown, because she constantly disappears and reappears in a different form. She is revealed to be a Mockingbird (a mutant), so named because Charles Darwin discovered evolution by observing different types of mockingbirds. She developed telepathic powers as a child and was saved by Professor Yes (a female Professor X parody), who took Julia to St. Ovidius's School for Wayward children. There, Julia fell in love with Henry Hart, a pyrokinetic fellow student, and was groomed to become a member of Yes’ Millennial Men. Although Julia was bothered by the fact that she was the only member of the team, she remained loyal and able. Her team primarily went to war against enemy Mockingbirds led by Lodestone (Magneto). Julia started developing new powers, which bothered the Millennial Men (possibly because she was a woman). Then she had an encounter with the cosmic entity Chaybodis in space, giving her the powers of a god. Out of fear and jealousy, Yes and the Millennial Men encouraged her to keep a tight leash on her new abilities. Matters came to a head when the team faced Retcon, a new ally of Lodestone's, who killed Hart by transporting him into a timeline where he was not immune to fire. A furious Julia punched Retcon across the globe and grew a meadow on the Ice Shelf before abandoning her team. For the next several months, Yes stalked her psychically in an attempt to bring her home. Julia tried to numb herself with sex, seeing her teammates’ disapproval as a double standard. She tracks down Retcon, but is unable to hurt him, and he transports them both to an alternate timeline where America and Europe never existed. Retcon reveals that had Hart been allowed to live, he would have stolen Julia's power and used it to destroy the world, and that if Julia returns, her teammates will bury her alive. Julia and Retcon stay together in the alternate timeline for years, eventually having sex. Then Retcon abruptly teleports her back to the moment of Hart's death, putting her in a new timeline. Julia saves Hart's life and then abandons Earth forever in order to protect herself and others. However, Charybodis takes control up in space, driving Julia to eat a star and wipe out a solar system. She realizes that Retcon and Lodestone manipulated her with alternatre realities in order to drive her to xenocide. Julia is abandoned by her power and falls back to Earth, where she is treated much more harshly than any male criminal, including Retcon. Retcon is given custody of Julia and cycles her through an endless ring of alternate realities, including one where she is his abused wife. In some of these realities, Julia is dead, allowing her to seek comfort with her ghostly friends and the gargoyles of Deadtown. She is only allowed to remember who she is for a-fifteen minute stretch each week, although she still has some hope of being placed in a timeline where she has the power to free herself.https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/guide-comic-book- wives-girlfriends-inspired-refrigerator-monologues/  References  ","title":"Jean Grey in other media"},{"id":"12758402","text":"El Cajon Boulevard is a major east–west thoroughfare through San Diego, La Mesa and El Cajon, California. Before the creation of Interstate 8 it was the principal automobile route from San Diego to El Cajon, the Imperial Valley, and points east as U.S. Route 80; it is now signed as a business loop of Interstate 8. Route description The boulevard now consists of two disconnected portions, one in San Diego and La Mesa, and the other in El Cajon. The central section through La Mesa's Grossmont Pass was obliterated when Interstate 8 was built. History It was formerly part of U.S. Route 80, and became a business loop for Interstate 8 when U.S. Route 80 was decommissioned and replaced by the interstate. It is designated as a historic highway by the state of California. Only portions of what would become El Cajon Boulevard in both La Mesa and El Cajon were originally part of US 80. During a re-routing through San Diego onto Park Boulevard in 1929, the western portion of El Cajon Boulevard was added to US 80. The next section of El Cajon Boulevard added to US 80 was between La Mesa and El Cajon around 1940. Today, most of the latter route from La Mesa to El Cajon has been overlaid by I-8. The final part of El Cajon Boulevard to receive the US 80 designation was a small piece between Park Boulevard and Normal Street in the late 1940s early 1950s when US 80 was re-routed off Park Boulevard onto the new Cabrillo Freeway. US 80 ceased to exist legislatively within California after July 1, 1964. It has been cited as a prime example of a commercial strip whose growth and development was shaped by the automobile, as opposed to the parallel University Avenue commercial strip whose growth was shaped by the trolley. Since El Cajon Boulevard was formerly the major route east from San Diego, there are many old hotels and motels on it. One of them, the Lafayette Hotel, is of considerable historic interest. The first Jack in the Box restaurant was opened at 6270 El Cajon Boulevard by Robert O. Peterson in 1951.Jack in the Box website:history The site had originally been a drive-in diner called \\"Topsy's\\", later renamed \\"Oscar's\\" after Peterson's middle name, which was a classic drive-in where food was served by carhops to patrons in the parking lot. Jack in the Box was the first drive-through, with the innovation of a two-way intercom that allowed one car to place an order while another car was being served. Other restaurants had previously offered drive-up window service, but Jack in the Box was the first major chain to make drive-through windows the focus of its operation.Langdon, Philip, Orange Roofs, Golden Arches: The architecture of American chain restaurants, page 104, Knopf, 1986, The street was the site of the El Cajon Boulevard Riot in August 1960, also known as the Drag Strip Riot, considered one of the first major youth riots of the 1960s. In the latter part of the 20th century, El Cajon Boulevard developed an unsavory reputation as a hotspot for prostitution. Current conditions The El Cajon Boulevard Business Improvement Association was formed in 1988 to improve physical and economic conditions along the 60 blocks of the boulevard between Park Boulevard and 54th Street. The association installed a large \\"The Boulevard\\" sign (see photo) to document the street's importance. The College Area Business Improvement District was formed in 1996 and covered the area east of 54th Street to the La Mesa border at 73rd Street.

He is one of the creators of the GoogleSky concept, of the idea of astronomical outreach at South by SouthWest 2013 and of the James Webb Space Telescope iBook. Professional career Conti was born in Palmanova, Italy. He received his laurea degree in physics from the University of Trieste, Italy, with a thesis titled “Binary Galaxies in the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Redshift Survey.” During the following two years, he worked on the largest sample (at the time) of optical rotation curves of galaxies at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), in Trieste. There he developed algorithms to automate the extraction of physical parameters from galactic rotation curves, paving the way for the analysis of much larger samples. He has since specialized in statistical methods, computational astrophysics, and large datasets. in 2000 Conti graduated from the Ohio State University with a Ph.D. thesis on correlating galactic properties with the physics of galaxy formation. He then became a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Pittsburgh. In 2003, Conti joined the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) to co-lead the development of a new archive for the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). He integrated this effort with work on the National Virtual Observatory. In January 2005, he became Branch Manager for the Astronomy Tools and Applications (ASTTA) branch at STScI's Engineering System and Software Division. ASTTA develops some of the best-known software products for the astronomical community, such as Astronomer Proposal Tool, PyRAF, and Multidrizzle. At the 15th annual ADASS conference in October 2005, Conti became interested in the Google Earth software that allows anyone to browse Earth with a simple point-and-click interface. Back at STScI he sent a proposal to John Hanke, the Head of Google Earth and Google Maps, to extend the Google Earth interface to space-based data. Hanke agreed to have Brian McClendon establish a project plan for such a product, called GoogleSky. In September 2006, Conti became Chief Engineer for the Data Management System at STScI. Following his involvement with Google he became Development Manager at STScI's Community Missions Office (CMO). CMO serves as the conduit between mission teams and STScI personnel to ensure support for mission science operations, data archiving, grants administration, peer review and education/outreach. In 2008 Conti received first prize in the Pirelli Internetional Award for the development of GoogleSky.https://web.archive.org/web/20130122034331/http://www.pirelliaward.com/index.html In 2010 Conti became the Archive Scientist for the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope, the NASA UV and Optical data archive. In 2011 Conti became the Innovation Scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA's premier space observatory of the next decade. In 2013 Conti became the Innovation Manager for the Civil Air and Space at Northrop Grumman Corporation. In 2018 Conti became the Director for New Business and Innovative Solutions at Ball Aerospace & Technologies.

The conflict broke out on 11 May 1978 after 6,500 rebels from the Congolese National Liberation Front (FNLC), a Katangese separatist militia, crossed the border from Angola into Zaire in an attempt to achieve the province's secession from the Zairian regime of Mobutu Sese Seko. The FNLC captured the important mining town of Kolwezi.Widstrand, Carl Gösta, Timothy M. Shaw, and Douglas George Anglin. Canada, Scandinavia, and Southern Africa, 1978. Page 130. The Mobutist government appealed for foreign assistance and French and Belgian military intervention beat back the invasion, just as in 1977.George, Edward. The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965-1991: From Che Guevara to Cuito Cuanavale, 2005. Page 136. The US and Cuba coerced Angola and Zaire into negotiations leading to a non-aggression pact. That ended support for insurgencies in each other's countries. Zaire temporarily cut off support to the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC), the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and Angola forbade further activity by the Shaba separatists. The US worked with France in repelling the invaders in the first military co-operation between the two since the Vietnam War. U.S. Air Force elements involved included a Combat Control Team (air traffic controllers) of the 435th Tactical Airlift Wing, the 445th Military Airlift Wing, and other airlift wings. Battle of Kolwezi The French Foreign Legion's 2 Foreign Paratroop Regiment had 600 troops, who took back Kolwezi after a seven-day battle and airlifted 2,250 European citizens to Belgium but not before the FNLC had massacred 80 Europeans and 200 Africans.

He is noted for his work on the American Revolution, the Constitution, and the regional history of Northern California. American Revolution In 2001, Raphael's People's History of the American Revolution synthesized the \\"bottom-up\\" history that grabbed the attention of scholars in the field since the 1960s. Howard Zinn, author of People's History of the United States, endorsed the book and used it to initiate his \\"People's History\\" series, published by The New Press. While both Raphael and Zinn view common people as significant historical agents, Zinn's focus is decidedly more political, focusing on dissent and protest, while Raphael deals with everyday experiences as well as social movements.Times Literary Supplement, February 1, 2002; Boston Globe, April 6, 2001; William and Mary Quarterly, 59:1 (January 2002); American Spirit (Daughters of the American Revolution), July–August, 2001. In 2002, in The First American Revolution, Raphael chronicled the overthrow of British authority in the hinterlands of Massachusetts in 1774, the year before Lexington and Concord. The dynamics of the buildup to war have been generally overlooked in America's core national narrative, but Raphael showed how the citizens of Massachusetts, in response to being disenfranchised by the Massachusetts Government Act, seized political and military power throughout the province in dramatic form. In the town of Worcester, 4,622 militiamen from 37 towns throughout the county — half the adult male population — lined both sides of Main Street and forced the British appointed officials to walk the gauntlet between them, hats in hand, reciting their resignations 30 times apiece. Similar takeovers occurred in every county seat outside Boston, which was garrisoned by British troops. These events, well documented at the time but dropped from the national narrative since the mid-19th century, provide fuller context for the outbreak of war. Raphael demonstrated that the British march on Lexington and Concord, rather than \\"starting\\" the Revolution, signaled a counteroffensive to regain control of a province that American patriots had already seized. Alerted by the disappearance of the 1774 Massachusetts rebellion from history texts, Raphael explored the underpinnings of our national storytelling. In 2004, his Founding Myths examined thirteen time honored tales — Paul Revere's Ride, the Winter at Valley Forge, \\"Give me liberty or give me death,\\" etc. — and detailed their etymology in the 19th century, when an emerging nationalism and narrative demands combined to alter the historical record.Boston Globe, September 26, 2004; Worcester Telegram and Gazette, October 5, 2004; Chicago Tribune, December 2, 2004. In 2009, in Founders: The People Who Brought You a Nation, Raphael developed an original synthesis of the Founding Era, blending his previous bottom-up approach into the traditional national narrative. His seven lead characters — some high, some low — include both General George Washington and Private Joseph Plumb Martin, and both Robert Morris, so rich that he bailed out the bankrupt nation, and Thomas Young, a peripatetic revolutionary who spread rebellion in seven states. Constitution Raphael next turned to histories of the Constitution: President: How and Why the Founders Created a Chief Executive (2012) and Constitutional Myths: What We Get Wrong and How to Get It Right (2013). His The U. S. Constitution: The Citizen's Annotated Edition (2016) walked readers through the document clause-by- clause and amendment-by- amendment. What was the intent of the framers? How was it understood back then, and how is it interpreted today? Interweaving historical and contemporary contexts, he translated \\"Constitution-ese\\" for our time. Working with the Constitutional Sources Project (ConSource), Raphael has developed a series of interactive lesson plans—\\"Choosing to Make a Nation\\"—in which students participate in debates as delegates to the Constitutional Convention or members of Congress in the Early Republic. Early books Raphael's first books focused primarily on the history and regional issues of Northern California, where he has lived since the late 1960s. His Everyday History of Somewhere, an earthy treatment based on interviews with old-timers that intermingled natural with human history, won the California Commonwealth Club award for best book on California for 1774. In Edges: Human Ecology of the Backcountry; Tree Talk: The People and Politics of Timber (and its sequel, More Tree Talk: The People, Politics, and Economics of Timber); and Cash Crop: An American Dream?, he explored issues of contemporary local concern (development, timber, marijuana) in a unique journalistic style, interweaving Studs Terkel-style interviews with narrative history and analysis.Seattle Times, October 18, 1981; San Francisco Chronicle, December 13, 1981, and August 1, 1985; American Forests, January 1982; Los Angeles Times April 18, 1982. In 2007, with Freeman House (author of Totem Salmon), Raphael wrote an in-depth exploration of white-Indian conflicts of the mid-19th century in Northwest California, titled Two Peoples, One Place.San Francisco Chronicle, November 26, 2007. Raphael has also written a book on male initiation rites in contemporary American culture (The Men from the Boys), a study of the careers of teachers (The Teachers' Voice), and with his son Neil, a juvenile mystery (Comic Cops). His play on John and Jessie Freemont played to audiences across Northern California.New York Times, October 15, 1985, and March 12, 1989.. Editorial work In 2006 Raphael edited an issue on the Founders for Forum magazine that included original contributions from scholars Gary Nash, Alfred Young, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, Richard Beeman, Woody Holton, Carol Berkin, and Jack Rakove.Forum (Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society), Summer 2006. In 2011, with Gary Nash and Alfred Young, he edited Revolutionary Founders: Rebels, Radicals, and Reformer in the Making of the Nation, a collection of original biographical essays by twenty-two scholars. He is currently an associate editor for Journal of the American Revolution. Personal life A native of New York City, Raphael moved west after graduating high school. He holds BA and MAT degrees from Reed College and an MA from the University of California at Berkeley. He spent the summer of 1962 in North Carolina registering black voters and integrating public facilities and the summer of 1964 with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's \\"Freedom Summer\\" in Mississippi. His work in the \\"Movement\\" of the sixties influenced his grassroots journalistic style and his bottom-up telling of history.Raleigh Times, August 7, 8, 10, 14, 1962; News and Observer (Raleigh), August 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1962; The Carolinian, August 11 and 18, 1962; New York Times, June 20, 1964; Delta Democratic Times, Greenville, MI, June 25, 1964. Raphael settled in rural Northern California, where he raised two sons with his wife, Marie. (One of Marie's brothers, Robert Guillemin, is Boston's well-known street artist, Sidewalk Sam, whose bottom-up approach to art resembles Raphael's treatment of history.) Since age 50, Raphael has been a recreational whitewater kayaker.Record Searchlight (Redding, CA), July 14, 2004. For fifteen years Raphael taught all subjects except foreign language at a one-room public high school in his remote neighborhood.Rethinking Schools 16:2 (Winter 2004-2005); North Coast Journal interview, April 12, 2001. He also taught at Humboldt State University and College of the Redwoods. Known for his lucid style, Raphael blends teaching skills with strict academic discipline, writing works of scholarly importance in language accessible to lay readers.

In Belgium, it was known as the Combi, and in Taiwan the latter generation was marketed as the Estratto. It was also called the Subaru E10 and Subaru E12 respectively in some places, the names referring to the size of the engines. The Sumo shared many characteristics with the Sambar, except it had extended front and rear bumpers and a larger engine borrowed from the Subaru Justy. Because of these modifications, it didn't conform to kei car regulations, which stipulate the maximum dimensions of the vehicle and the maximum engine displacement requirements, which then determine the vehicle tax to be paid. It was launched with the option of four- wheel drive and powered by 1.0- and 1.2-litre 3-cylinder EF engines based on those used in the Subaru Justy although in the van they were rear mounted. Somewhat unusual for a microvan, the 1,200 cc Sumo could be ordered with selectable 4WD, operated via a gear stick mounted button. In normal driving conditions, only the rear wheels were driven, as there was no central differential to allow highway driving in 4WD mode. In 1994, Subaru's Full Time 4WD (S-AWD) was added to the options list with the ECVT transmission only and a viscous coupling. An oil cooler was installed on European versions to better facilitate light duty towing. Second generation Subaru Libero (Germany) The Sumo was discontinued when the sixth generation Sambar was introduced, and the market that the Sumo was targeted at was refocused towards the Subaru Forester, which, in comparison to the Sumo, had permanent 4WD, a more potent 2.5 L boxer engine and increased cargo capacity. In Japan, the Domingo market segment is now served by the Subaru Exiga, which is capable of carrying up to seven passengers. A more passenger car-like Subaru Domingo high-roof van with 997 cc, later 1,189 cc engines and coil springs at the rear was added in October 1983. It had a length of 341/342.5 cm and a width of 143 cm. This vehicle would stay available well after the release of the next generation Sambar. In the export the smaller Sambar received a 665 cc engine and the vehicle was called Subaru 700 (length 322.5 cm).

The hamlet lies 5 miles to the west of Nantwich and 6 miles to the north east of Malpas. The total population is a little over a hundred people. Nearby villages include Faddiley, Norbury, Ravensmoor and Wrenbury. It should not be confused with the civil parish of Chorley near the town of Alderley Edge, also in Cheshire East. Governance Chorley is administered jointly with the adjacent parish of Cholmondeley by Cholmondeley & Chorley Parish Council. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 Chorley falls in the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury, which has been represented by Edward Timpson since 2019, after being represented by Stephen O'Brien (1999–2015) and Antoinette Sandbach (2015–19). Geography and transport The River Weaver forms the southern boundary of the parish and part of its western boundary, and two of its tributaries run north–south through the parish. Another brook forms part of the parish's northern boundary. The terrain is gently undulating, with a high point of around 100 metres at the north-west corner of the parish and a low point of around 75 metres in the south, near Chorley Stock. The main land use is agricultural. There are multiple small meres and ponds scattered across the farmland, as well as a few small areas of woodland. Nantwich Road runs east–west through the parish to Larden Green in the adjacent parish of Faddiley; it connects to the A49 – which runs north–south around 500 metres to the west – via Wrenbury Road near Chorley Bank. The hamlet of Chorley lies at the junction of Nantwich Road with Chorley Green Lane, which runs north west back to the A49. Demography According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 100,Neighbourhood Statistics: Chorley CP (accessed 12 August 2007) increasing to 107 in 42 households at the 2011 census. This represents a decline from the population of 1851; historical population figures are 126 (1801), 173 (1851), 132 (1901) and 167 (1951). The population density was 0.2 persons/hectare in 2011, well below the average of 3.2 persons/hectare for Cheshire East. Education As of 2016, there are no schools within the civil parish.

The system includes 26 individual libraries including Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library (the central library). History Pre-1923 book plate for the DC Public Library. The library was founded in 1896 by an act of Congress after a lobbying effort by Theodore W. Noyes, editor of the Washington Evening Star newspaper. Noyes served on the library's board of trustees for 50 years. The first library branch was located in a home at 1326 New York Avenue NW, with a collection of 15,000 donated books and an appropriation of $6,720 for its maintenance. This was replaced by a main library, donated by Andrew Carnegie, built at Mount Vernon Square, which now houses the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. and an Apple Store. President Theodore Roosevelt attended the dedication of this building in 1903. Several of the branch libraries still in use were also built with funds donated by Carnegie. In 1972, the main library was replaced by a Ludwig Mies van der Rohe-designed building dedicated as a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr. Governance DCPL is an independent agency of the District of Columbia municipal government, managed by a Chief Librarian that is selected and reviewed by a Board of Library Trustees. The Board of Library Trustees are appointed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, subject to review and approval by the Council of the District of Columbia. The budget is also determined by the Council of the District of Columbia based on a request submitted by the Mayor as part of the annual budget process for the entire municipal government. The United States Congress also has to approve of the District's budget as a part of their oversight of the District of Columbia as the nation's capital. The Chief Librarian is often invited to attend the Mayor's Cabinet meetings and works closely with the City Administrator on how to execute the DCPL budget. The District's Chief Financial Officer provides a fiscal officer from that office to ensure that financial practices within DCPL meet with District requirements. DCPL also has independent procurement authority, allowing them to execute contracts for books, electronic resources, furniture, equipment, and construction services. In addition to the Board of Library Trustees, the Council of the District of Columbia provides oversight for DCPL via a Council Committee on Education. The DC Council routinely has Performance Oversight and Budget hearings for the D.C. libraries annually.  Books from Birth  The D.C. Public Library runs a program called Books from Birth. The program is for children aged newborn to 5. All enrolled children receive a book in the mail every month. All children who live in the district are eligible. The program runs in partnership with Imagination Library, a nonprofit run by singer Dolly Parton's Dollywood Foundation. The D.C. program launched in 2016, and as of November 2017, 57 percent of eligible children are enrolled (27,000 children).

The film was directed by Lewis Gilbert and stars Jack Warner in a familiar role playing a policeman, Anthony Steel, Joy Shelton and Sid James as a dubious boxing promoter. The film was a noted success compared to its small budget and helped establish Gilbert as a director.Screen: Of human Bondage Lewis Gilbert is best known for his three Bond films but as he celebrates his 80th birthday he tells Nicholas Jones about a lifetime in the movies and how he almost made The Godfather Jones, Nicholas. The Guardian; London (UK) [London (UK)]10 Mar 2000: FRIDAY10. The film was remade in 1962 as Emergency starring Glyn Houston. Synopsis The film centres around a race against the clock to locate three blood donors each able to donate one pint of a rare type of blood to save the life of a young girl suffering from leukaemia. The doctor in charge of treating the girl enlists the assistance of police officer Inspector Lane in order to assist in the search for suitable donors. The three donors are each from very different backgrounds, a white boxer, a black sailor, and finally a murderer who has been on the run from the police for a number of years. The boxer's donation is fairly straightforward, having only to avoid his manager, the sailor's donation is more complicated, following a war-time incident where a dying Nazi soldier refused to accept his offer of a donation which he attributes to racism, he initially refuses to donate, until it is explained to him that the Nazi officer refused his donation for reasons that can be attributed to the Nazi's master race ideology. The final donor is a murderer on the run from the police, living under an assumed name. The police eventually locate the man and he suffers a gunshot injury. He must choose to donate the last pint of blood needed and die at the scene from blood loss, or to refuse to donate in order to receive treatment in hospital but with the knowledge he will surely be found guilty of murder at trial and sentenced to death. The criminal chooses to donate and the young girl survives.

She served again during World War I in the dangerous North Atlantic Ocean, delivering general goods and ammunition to American Expeditionary Force troops in Europe. Acquisition for Spanish–American War service The first Navy ship to be named Glacier was built as the merchant ship, SS Port Chalmers in 1891 by J.L. Thompson & Son, Sunderland, England; purchased from the Federal Line, London, July 1898; commissioned at New York 5 July 1898, Comdr. J. P. Merrill, USN, commanding; had her name changed to USS Delmonico 6 July 1898, and to USS Glacier 6 days later. Glacier departed Hampton Roads 15 August, and for the following 5 months she supplied ice, meat, and stores to ships of the North Atlantic Fleet operating in the West Indies during the Spanish–American War. Sailing from San Juan, Puerto Rico, 3 January 1899, she arrived at New York 1 week later, and decommissioned there 6 March. Philippine Islands support operations Glacier recommissioned at New York 31 March 1899, assigned to the Asiatic Station, she stood out of Hampton Roads 24 May and arrived 15 July at Manila Bay via the Mediterranean and Suez Canal. Operating in the Philippines during these troubled years, she supplied U.S. Army and Navy forces with ice, meat, and stores; delivered stores to reconstructed gunboats at Hong Kong; and transported large quantities of meat and provisions from Australia to Manila. Sailing out of Manila Bay 22 April 1903, Glacier arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, 29 June, and decommissioned there 1 August. Additional turn-of-the-century assignments Recommissioning there 15 December, she loaded supplies and provisions at New York and delivered her cargo to ships at Guantanamo, Pensacola, Florida, and the Panama Canal Zone (14 February – 7 July 1904). Arriving at Boston, Massachusetts, 17 July, Glacier decommissioned there on the 30th and, following repairs, recommissioned 15 September and fitted out for special duty. Continued Philippine Islands assignment Glacier became a unit of the Special Service Squadron composed of Brutus (AC-15), Caesar (AC-16), and Potomac (AT-50), assigned to tow the floating dry dock Dewey (YFD-1) from Sparrows Point, Maryland, to the Philippines. Departing Solomons, Maryland, on the Patuxent River 28 December 1905, the squadron arrived at Olongapo, Philippines, via Las Palmas in the Canaries, Port Said, Suez, and Singapore, 10 July 1906. Following delivery of the dock, Glacier proceeded to Cavite for discharge of cargo and repairs. She stood out of Cavite 16 August, and arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, 14 November via the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean, and New York. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet Departing Boston 4 January 1907, Glacier became a unit of the Atlantic Fleet, and engaged in supplying fresh provisions to ships operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean area until returning to New York 14 October. Transferred to the Pacific Fleet USS Glacier 1908 postcard As a storeship, she departed New York 5 December and accompanied the Atlantic Fleet on its good will and training cruise to the Pacific, stopping at various ports in the Caribbean, South America, and Mexico en route. Arriving 14 April 1908 at San Francisco, Glacier cruised with the fleet on the California coast until departing San Francisco, California, 29 June. She continued as supply ship to the Atlantic Fleet on its famous voyage around the world, visiting Honolulu, the Fiji Islands, New Zealand, Australia, and the Philippines. On 21 October, while at Cavite, she became detached from the Atlantic Fleet and assigned to the Pacific Fleet in her former capacity. The Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Fleet reports in 1908: :\\"The storeships Culogoa (1889) and Glacier have been in constant attendance on the fleet, and have most successfully met all demands upon them. They have made the fleet absolutely independent of the local resources at the ports visited, which was necessary in view of the large number of men to be subsisted.\\" Loading provisions at Manila and Sydney, Australia (10 November-5 December), Glacier joined the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Talcahuano, Chile, 1 January 1909, and accompanied the fleet on a cruise to South and Central American ports and to Magdalena Bay. They arrived at Mare Island 2 June for repairs. World War I operations Continuing in her service as supply ship to the Pacific Fleet until 1918, Glacier was employed in delivering fresh provisions, stores, ammunition, target material, and mail; transporting personnel; and towing target rafts and coal barges. Her principal area of operations was on the U.S. West Coast, Mexico, and Central America. She made two trips to Asiatic waters (22 September 1909 – 14 February 1910 and 8 April – 17 August 1912) to supply ships operating in the Hawaiian area, the Philippines, and the China and Japan coasts. From 1913 to 1917 she operated between California and Mexico and Nicaragua, delivering stores, mail and men to the Fleet, investigating conditions at Mexican ports, and giving refuge to United States and other foreign citizens during the unsettled conditions in Mexico. She loaded stores, fresh meats, and ammunition at San Francisco 9 to 14 May 1917, arrived 30 June at Rio de Janeiro and, through March 1918, delivered her cargo to ships operating on the east coast of South America. Delivering food and stores to U.S. troops in Europe Departing Rio de Janeiro 2 April, Glacier arrived at New York on the 24th, and became assigned to NOTS. As a Naval Overseas Transport Ship, she made three trips to Europe carrying fresh meats and general stores to naval forces operating in European waters. The first two trips were made from New York to the British Isles, 2 June-26 July 1918 and 13 August-20 October 1918, and the third trip from New York to Brest, 4 November 1918 – 4 January 1919, returning to Norfolk, Virginia, with a cargo of aviation material and high explosives for New York. Standing in at New York 10 January 1919, she was detached from NOTS and assigned to the Train Squadron, Atlantic Fleet. From 6 May to 25 June 1919, she issued stores to the Atlantic Fleet and engaged in target practice with the fleet on the East Coast. Reassigned back to the Pacific Glacier departed New York 24 July, arrived 17 August at San Pedro, California, and became attached to the Train Squadron, Pacific Fleet. Until 1921 she was engaged in transporting stores, ammunition, and personnel to ships operating off the California coast and Panama Canal Zone area. Final decommissioning Arriving 31 October 1921 at Mare Island, Glacier decommissioned there 6 March 1922 and was sold 17 August to Barde Steel & Machinery Co., Seattle, Washington, for $22,000.

The LBC was incorporated on September 11, 1889, by William Thomas Carpenter and several other prominent Grand Junction, Colorado, business men. The purpose of the railroad was to haul coal from the Book Cliff mines owned by Carpenter to Grand Junction. Construction began in 1890 and progressed in sections until the rails finally reached Carpenter, Colorado, which was the station name applied to the Book Cliff mines' coal camp, in the third week of June 1892. The LBC's first locomotive was a 20-year-old, Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG;) cast-off that Carpenter purchased for $1,200. Throughout the railroad’s 35-year existence it owned but five locomotives, two of which were unique gear-driven Shay locomotive types that were purchased new from the builder. Other rolling stock included about 30 coal cars, a caboose, two excursion cars, and a couple of flat cars for hauling stone and performing maintenance-of-way work. The road's cars and coaches were all built by Grand Junction craftsmen, except a few that were rented from the D&RG; on occasion. The LBC made money for Carpenter; he then re-invested it into a project to enlarge the road. The project, a railroad called the Colorado, Wyoming & Great Northern (CW&GN;), would have negated the need for the Uintah Railway. The CW&GN; financially overextended Carpenter and he was unable to weather the Panic of 1893. Isaac Chauncy Wyman then acquired the LBC through bond foreclosure and reincorporated it as the Book Cliff Railroad about 1900. One of the most pleasant aspects of the railroad was the excursions it hosted. An outing to the Book Cliffs meant a day of hunting, horseback riding, hiking, picnicking, and a general good time. Of special note were the Memorial Day excursions; scores of people would go to Carpenter, gather the abundant wildflowers there and return to town with them to decorate their loved ones' graves. Associated with many excursions was a conveyance called a Go-devil. It consisted of little more than a few boards bolted together and attached to a set of handcar wheels. Thrill seekers used them to coast back down the tracks to Grand Junction at break-neck speeds. The most interesting feature along the line was its double-horseshoe curve about 8 miles out of Grand Junction. It was there that most of the road's accidents occurred. The worst was when Locomotive No. 4 rolled on its side sometime between 1915 and 1925. A curious fact about the LBC was that it lacked locomotive turning facilities. Their locomotives operated facing the same direction the entire time the road owned them. When a train reached Carpenter, the engine was run around the train on a passing track, coupled to the other end, and it pulled the return trip to Grand Junction in reverse. In 1925 the Monument Investment Company purchased the railroad from Princeton University in order to acquire the company's yard property in Grand Junction. They began railroad scrapping operations that summer and before long, pieces of the railroad were sold to buyers scattered throughout the country.  References  * Lampert, Lyndon J.; Robert W. McLeod.

It was described as beginning around 50,000 years before the present (B.P), lasting roughly 20,000 years, and ending ca. 30,000 B.P. In Africa the Mousterian industry was an archaeological term for a category of Middle Stone Age (or Middle Paleolithic) stone tool production. During the time that archaeological dates were determined by radiocarbon decay, the production of these tools was once thought to have occurred just before the limit of radiocarbon dating at 40 – 35 thousand years ago. In Europe Mousterian tools are made by archaic Neanderthals. In Africa these tools are made by early anatomically modern Homo sapiens. Similar people also made similar tools which are categorized as Alterian. To avoid confusion about the makers, the Mousterian and Alterian tools are now sometimes grouped as Aterian. With more recent dating methods, these tools are now understood to have been mostly produced during the humid Eemian interglacial and later phases of MIS 5, from 130 kybp to 72 kybp. Mousterian tools are frequently older than the Aterian tools. During the dry period that followed in Northern Africa, from 71 to 14.5 kybp, recent research has found that there were 3 semi-humid interruptions: 65–61 kybp, 52.5–50.5 kybp and 37.5–33 kybp. The later 2 have sometimes been grouped to constitute a “Mousterian Pluvial.” They are not associated with strong “Green Sahara” events line the ones of the Eemian in early MIS 5; the late MIS 5 humid period (from 105 – 75 kybp); or the early Holocene. Few, if any, Mousterian or Aterian tool makers survived in North Africa to witness them. Some older descriptions of the Mousterian Pluvial described it as a strong African Humid period. During earlier strong African Humid periods, the now-desiccated regions of northern Africa were well-watered, bearing lakes, swamps, and river systems that no longer exist. What is now the Sahara desert supported typical African wildlife of grassland and woodland environments: herbivores from gazelle to giraffe to ostrich, predators from lion to jackal, even hippopotamus and crocodile, as well as extinct forms like the Pleistocene camel. The humid periods of 52.5–50.5 kybp and 37.5–33 kybp were not has strong as those of the earlier Eemian humid period. The old theory was that the Mousterian Pluvial was caused by large- scale climatic changes during the last ice age. By 50 kybp (thousand years before present), the Wisconsin glaciation (\\"Würm glaciation\\" in Europe) was well-advanced; growing ice sheets in North America and Europe displaced the standard climatic zones of the northern hemisphere southward. The temperate zones of Europe and North America acquired an Arctic or tundra climate, and the rain bands typical of the temperate zones dropped to the latitudes of northern Africa. Curiously, the same influences that created the Mousterian Pluvial were thought to have brought it to a close. In the period of its fullest development, c. 30 to 18 kybp, the Laurentide Ice Sheet not only covered an enormous geographic area, but increased its altitude to 1750 meters (more than 1 mile). It generated its own long term weather patterns, which affected the jet stream passing over the North American continent. The jet stream effectively split in two, creating a new dominant weather pattern over the northern hemisphere that brought harsher conditions to several regions (including parts of Central Asia and the Middle East) -- changes that included an end to the Mousterian Pluvial and a return to a more arid climate in northern Africa. It is now understood that the major African Humid period events are caused by increased insolation in the northern hemisphere and the impact of continental surface warming on the tropical monsoons.

It details the Armenian Genocide, the events leading up to it, and the events following it. It begins with the state of the Ottoman Empire in the 1880s. Abdul Hamid II has come to power, and there are many issues in the country that he is expected to solve. Specifically, the country was losing money and land. Abdul Hamid II blamed these issues on non-Muslims in the country, and in particular, the Armenians. Over the course of the 1890s laws are passed limiting the rights of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. By the early 20th century, there was extreme overtaxing, robbery, and murder against Armenians, all going with no repercussion. The government began supporting these actions by sending the military to help. As the First World War was fought by the Ottoman Empire, the leader, Abdul Hamid II lost popularity. He was overthrown by a group of people known as the Young Turks. They said they would bring reforms for the Armenians, as well as end the war. Since he said this, the Armenians supported him, thinking that they would be treated as equals once more. Instead, the new government ordered masacres and death marches. Armenians were rounded up and killed. The ones lucky enough to escape the massacres were deported to other countries like Lebanon and Syria. The United States Red Cross was permitted into the country starting in 1915. The help they could provide was limited. The United States Government was also considering trying to help the Armenians by creating a country which they would get after the First World War. Woodrow Wilson and some members of congress supported this idea, but it never worked fully because the United States had oil interests in the Ottoman Empire and wanted to remain on good terms. Armenia instead became a state in the Soviet Union. The United States had ambitious plans for what to do with the Armenians, but economic issues prevented the United States from helping in any meaningful way. Other European powers at the time also did not do much. More than one hundred high-ranking government officials from the Ottoman Empire were put on trial for war crimes, fewer than 20 were convicted, and then none of the served their full sentences. Reception The book was received quite well in the United States. The historical accuracy of the book is not questionable considering the primary sources it has to prove the information it states correct. Some people who described the book called it \\"gripping\\" and \\"an important and compelling account (of the genocide).\\" \\"The Burning Tigris does succeed in resurrecting a little-known chapter of the American and as well as the Armenian history\\" \\\\- The New York Times. The book was praised for the new bits of information it found, such as certain primary sources which were published in the book. Author Peter Balakian also wrote poems, translations of Armenian literature to English, and 4 other books relating to the Armenian Genocide and how the United States responded.

For these reasons, as well as in some cases their size, Alt-A loans are not eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 3 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans, although there is no single accepted definition of Alt-A.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 3 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Typically Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, average credit scores, higher loan-to-values, and more investment properties and secondary homes.Fabozzi Fj. (2005). The handbook of mortgage-backed securities, pp. 207-57. McGraw-Hill Professional. A-minus is related to Alt-A, with some lenders categorizing them the same, but A-minus is traditionally defined as mortgage borrowers with a FICO score of below 680 while Alt-A is traditionally defined as loans lacking full documentation.Alt-A Mortgages. Alt-A mortgages may have excellent credit but may not meet underwriting criteria for other reasons.Fabozzi FJ. (1999). Fixed Income Securities, p. 286. During the past decade, a significant amount of Alt-A mortgages resulted from refinancings, rather than property purchases.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 3 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Alt-A loans should not be confused with alternative documentation loans, which are typically considered to have the same risk as full documentation loans despite the use of different documents to verify the relevant information.Investopedia. Alternative Documentation. As with subprime mortgages, a greater portion of Alt-A mortgages tend to be originated by specialized lenders, rather than banks and thrifts.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 3 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Characteristics of Alt-A Within the U.S. mortgage industry, different mortgage products are generally defined by how they differ from the types of \\"conforming\\" or \\"agency\\" mortgages, ones guaranteed by the Government- Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There are numerous factors that might cause a mortgage not to qualify under the GSEs' traditional lending guidelines even though the borrower's creditworthiness is generally strong. A few of the more important factors are: * Reduced borrower income and asset documentation (for example, \\"stated income\\", \\"stated assets\\", \\"no income verification\\") * Borrower debt-to-income ratios above what Fannie or Freddie will allow for the borrower credit, assets and type of property being financed * Credit history with too many problems to qualify for an \\"agency\\" loan, but not so many as to require a subprime loan (for example, low FICO score or serious delinquencies, but no recent charge-offs or bankruptcy) * Loan to value ratios (percentage of the property price being borrowed) above agency limits for the property, occupancy or borrower characteristics involved In this way, Alt-A loans are \\"alternatives\\" to the standard of conforming, GSE- backed mortgages. Borrower considerations An example of a person requesting a Stated Income mortgage is an individual with multiple and varying sources of income that would require an onerous amount of paperwork to document, such as income from self-employment or investments. Note that reduced documentation loans still require that borrowers authorize the lender to order their tax returns at random from the Internal Revenue Service in order to verify the income on the application. The same documentation features are available under \\"subprime\\" guidelines, and similar ones may even be available under agency guidelines. Alt-A and subprime differ in that, generally speaking, an Alt-A borrower would have had a sufficient financial profile to qualify for a \\"conforming\\" mortgage, if only it weren't for one of the factors mentioned above, whereas a subprime borrower would suffer from exceptionally weak credit, income or asset characteristics. However, in cases where borrower, property and loan characteristics meet agency guidelines especially well, Fannie's and Freddie's automated preapproval systems generally grant reduced documentation features automatically at no extra cost. More expensive Alt-A or subprime loans are not necessary for strong borrowers to expedite their applications. Aside from reduced documentation features, Alt-A guidelines usually also offer borrowers greater flexibility than agency guidelines concerning borrower credit scores, income and asset levels. Thus a borrower whose financial profile might not meet agency guidelines for the loan terms requested might still be eligible under Alt-A guidelines. Property and occupancy considerations Aside from the borrower's credit and financial profile, GSE standards are also generally the most stringent regarding how much of a given property type's value or purchase price is permissible to lend on owner-occupied, second (\\"vacation\\") and non-owner occupied (\\"investment\\") homes, and under what conditions. The combination of these property and occupancy factors with a given borrower's profile can move the loan out of the \\"prime\\" category of agency-conforming loans and into less stringent categories such as Alt-A and subprime. For example, Fannie Mae might agree to purchase all loans made by a particular lender on single family second homes in a particular area at a particular maximum LTV for borrowers within given income, asset and credit limits. Borrowers beyond those limits, or those seeking loans above that maximum LTV for second homes, would need to apply for an Alt-A loan. Borrowers still further outside the income, asset and credit limits might need to consider subprime financing—difficult to find as of 2008. Similar to Alt-A lending, the jumbo and super-jumbo categories generally use an amalgam of agency and Alt-A guidelines for borrower eligibility while allowing larger maximum loan amounts than those permitted by the GSEs (as of 2007, $417,000 for a single family home outside Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the US Virgin Islands). Revaluation of risk During the subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2007, Alt-A mortgages came under particular scrutiny. One problem associated with Alt-A loans is the lack of necessary proof or documentation needed to be approved for a loan. Thus, lenders may be inclined to suggest borrowers skew their incomes or assets in order to qualify for a larger loan; in the long run, the borrowers may turn out to be unable to afford their payments but the lenders still collect a hefty profit. Because Alt-A loans are also the financing of choice for most non-owner occupied, investment properties, as a class they represent a far greater likelihood of borrower default than conventional, conforming mortgages, since people are more likely to abandon a property in which they do not live than they are to risk losing their primary homes. As of 2008, there was strong evidence of weakness among securities backed by Alt-A mortgages for reasons similar to the crisis in those backed by subprime. Because Alt-A loans were not primarily purchased by the GSEs, they thus became more expensive and much harder to find as a result of the general crisis in markets for mortgage-backed securities. Alt-A loans were still available from individual institutions which held them \\"in portfolio\\" rather than re-selling them to investors, and as of mid-2008 there was a strong push for the FNMA and FHLMC to be permitted to buy more of them. However, the interest rates in this lending category increased substantially between 2006 and 2008 as a result of the shrinking secondary market.

Although there are various types, it typically takes the form of a newborn baby and cries in the jungle to attract unwary travelers. Once it is picked up by an unfortunate passerby, it reverts to its true form and attacks the victim. The tiyanak is also depicted to take malevolent delight in leading travelers astray, or in abducting children. Historical Accounts \\"They had another deception—namely, that if any woman died in childbirth, she and the child suffered punishment; and that, at night, she could be heard lamenting. This was called patianac. May the honor and glory be God our Lord's, that among all the Tagalos not a trace of this is left; and that those who are now marrying do not even know what it is, thanks to the preaching of the holy gospel, which has banished it.\\" Fr. Juan de Plasencia, Customs of the Tagalogs (1589) \\"449. Pregnant women could not cut their hair, for they said that the children that they would bear would have no hair. When a woman is about to give birth, some men undress until they are stark naked. Then taking shields and catans, one takes his stand in the silong, and another on the ridge of the house, and they continually fence with the wind with their catans as long as the parturition lasts. I have removed some from this performance by force of punishment. They say that it is to keep the patiànac and the osuàng away from the woman. These are witches among them who come to obstruct the success of the childbirth, and to suck out the souls of children; and the people act thus in order to prevent them. He who does not wish to have this observed in public, through fear of punishment, removes his wife to another house for the parturition, if he thinks that the witch is in his.\\" Fr. Francisco de San Antonio, Cronicas (1738-44) \\"They have many other superstitions, as that of the patianac, a spirit or ideal being, whose employment or amusement consists in preventing, [41]by certain means peculiar to itself, the delivery of a woman in labour. To counteract the malignity of this spirit, the husband, fastening the door, reduces himself to a state of complete nudity, lights a fire, and arming himself with his sword, continues to flourish it furiously, until the woman is delivered.\\" Fr. Martinez de Zuniga, Estadismo (1803) Appearance and characteristics While various legends have slightly different versions of the tiyanak folklore, the stories all agree on its ability to mimic an infant, able to imitate an infant's cries for luring victims. In some legends, the Tiyanak may take the form of a specific child. *In one version, it retains the general shape of a baby but then forms sharp claws and fangs to attack its victim. *In another, it shares certain similarities with dwarfs and is similarly associated with the earth. In this version, the \\"true\\" form of the tiyanak is that of a little old man with wrinkled skin, a long beard and mustache, a flat nose and eyes the size of peseta coins. The same story says that a tiyanak is relatively immobile because one leg is shorter than the other. This deformity forces it to move by leaping and/or crawling rather than walking, making it difficult to hunt or stalk victims, but its ability to mimic an infant's cry compensates for this disadvantage. *In yet another story it is seen supernaturally flying through the forest (still in the form of a baby) and in a legend from the island of Mindoro it transforms into a black bird before flying away *In another version from Central Luzon, especially in Pampanga, the tiyanak are described as small, nut-brown people who don't walk on the ground but rather float on air. They have large noses, wide mouths, large fierce eyes and sharp voices. *In the Batangas version, the tiyanak are described as regular babies who were lost in the wild. They are believed to be babies who died without a name, aborted or otherwise. It also is said that when the cry of a tiyanak sounds soft, one is actually nearby, and conversely if the cry sounds loud, it is actually distant. Origins There are various stories on how tiyanaks came to be. The Mandaya people of Mindanao claim that the tiyanak is the spirit of a child whose mother died before giving birth. This caused it to be \\"born in the ground\\", thus gaining its current state. A similar supernatural creature in Malay folklore is the Pontianak, which was a woman who died before giving birth. With the Spanish colonization of the Philippines in the 16th century, the tiyanak myth was integrated into Catholicism. The tiyanak in the Catholic version were supposedly the souls of infants that died before being baptized. In modern-day Philippines, this definition has extended to that of aborted fetuses that returned from death to seek revenge on those who deprived them of life. It is also said that Tiyanak cannot go to the afterlife because of not having a name. This causes them to be Earth-bound creatures which wander around searching for someone to give them names. Countermeasures In local belief, various countermeasures are supposedly effective against the tiyanak. Those that were led astray by the creature's cries are believed to be able to break the enchantment by turning their clothes inside out. The tiyanak finds the method humorous enough to let go of the traveler and go back to the jungles. Loud noises such as a New Year's celebration are also thought to be enough to drive the tiyanak away from the vicinity. Objects believed to repel Aswang (vampiric shape-shifters), like garlic and the rosary, are also commonly believed to be effective against the tiyanak. It is also believed that giving a name to these lost souls will bring them peace, and offering a white candle will help guide its spirit to afterlife. In popular culture The tiyanak is the subject of many Philippine movies: *Tianak (1953) *Tiyanak (1988) *Juan Tanga, super naman, at ang kambal na tiyanak (1990) *Impakto (1996) *Tiyanaks (2007) Tiyanaks appeared in the 2006 TV series, Super Inggo. Dubbed as the \\"junanaks\\" by Budong and Pareng Jomar. They also appeared in week-32 2013 episodes of Juan dela Cruz (TV series).

The highway was constructed in 1962–1963 to service the Cane Creek potash mine and processing plant southwest of Moab. The highway was named one of the most beautiful highways opened to traffic in 1963. The entire length of SR-279 has been designated the Potash – Lower Colorado River Scenic Byway by the Utah State Legislature, however is known locally as Potash Road. This highway was intended to be part of a longer highway, State Route 278, that was to scale the canyon walls between Moab and Dead Horse Point State Park. Only the connection to the potash mine was constructed before the project was cancelled. Although the highway was constructed to aid the mining industry of southeastern Utah, the road is popular with tourists and four wheel drive enthusiasts. The jeep trails beginning where SR-279 ends are used to access Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point. Route description State Route 279 following the Colorado River The highway begins just north of Moab at a junction with U.S. Route 191 near the southern boundary of Arches National Park. The road follows the north bank of the Colorado River to the potash mine. The road is legislatively designated north–south, but actually serpentines for most of its length. The highway loosely parallels a spur of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad built at the same time and for the same purpose of serving the potash mine. The route of the railroad features a tunnel that bypasses most of the serpentine bends in the Colorado River between Moab and the potash plant. While in the Colorado River canyon, the highway passes by dinosaur footprints, Indian petroglyphs and jeep trails leading to Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point State Park. The highway also passes by three named natural arches, Corona Arch, Bow Tie Arch, and Jug Handle Arch. History The southern terminus of SR-279 as seen from Dead Horse Point State Park The State Road Commission approved a new State Route 279 in 1960, connecting US-160 (now US-191) northwest of Moab with Dead Horse Point State Park. The route would be mostly new construction, following the right (northwest) bank of the Colorado River to Day Canyon, where it would climb to the southwest onto the plateau containing the park. Within the park, an existing roadway, then its primary access road, would become part of SR-279.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated December 2007. Retrieved May 2008 The state legislature approved this highway in 1961. Later that year, the commission added a second route—State Route 278—that would continue south alongside the river from SR-279 to the Grand-San Juan County line.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated December 2007. Retrieved May 2008 However, when it approved the addition in 1963, the legislature made it part of SR-279, renumbering the spur to the park through Day Canyon as SR-278. In addition, the south end of SR-279 was changed to Potash, a point north of the county line where the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company was building a potash plant.New York Times, Texas Gulf Sulphur Plans Big Utah Potash Project, September 27, 1960, p. 49 SR-279 was soon built, but the road through Day Canyon was never constructed. In 1975, the legislature deleted SR-278 in favor of a new SR-313, which followed the existing county road to Dead Horse Point through Sevenmile Canyon. \\"Wall Street\\" along SR 279 is a popular rockclimbing area for tourists.

The village lies 1½ miles to the east of the centre of Crewe. The parish also includes a dispersed settlement of houses and farms called Slaughter Hill, the Jacobean mansion of Crewe Hall, and the industrial estates of Crewe Hall Enterprise Park and Crewe Hall Farm.. (British national grid reference system) Nearby villages include Haslington and Stowford. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 140, increasing to 213 at the 2011 Census. History Crewe Green, then known as Crewe, was originally a township within the ancient parish of Barthomley. In the 12th and 13th centuries, it was the seat of the de Crewe (or de Criwa) family. The manor passed to the de Praers family of Barthomley by the marriage of Johanna de Crewe to Richard de Praers in 1319. Later in the 14th century it passed to the Fouleshurst (or Foulehurst) family, who held the manor jointly with Barthomley until around 1575. Sir Randolph Crewe purchased the manor in 1608, and it was held by various branches of the Crewe family until 1936, when most of the land was sold to the Duchy of Lancaster. The present Crewe Hall was built for Sir Randolph and dates from 1615–36. Crewe Green was made a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1857, and a separate civil parish in 1866. It also lay within Nantwich Hundred, Nantwich Poor Law Union, and Nantwich Rural Sanitary District. Later on it was part of Nantwich Rural District. Changes to its boundaries were made in 1936, which included the transfer of Crewe railway station from the civil parish to the municipal borough of Crewe, adjacent to it. In 1974 local government re-organisation saw it become part of the borough of Crewe and Nantwich. The parish was also renamed in 1974 from Crewe to Crewe Green to avoid confusion with the neighbouring borough. Governance From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the new unitary authority of Cheshire East .Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 Crewe Green falls in the parliamentary constituency of Crewe and Nantwich, which has been represented by Kieran Mullan since 2019, after being represented by Laura Smith (2017–19), Edward Timpson (2008–17) and Gwyneth Dunwoody (1983–2008). Geography The Crewe–Alsager railway line and the B5077 road run east–west through the parish, and the Crewe and Nantwich Circular Walk runs north–south through it. Valley Brook (also known as the River Waldron) runs through the civil parish, as does Englesea Brook, which joins the Valley Brook about south of the parish church, after having formed the boundary between Crewe Green and the unparished area that comprises the town of Crewe. For a short distance, the boundary then follows Valley Brook..

North Point Douglas comprises the northern portion of a peninsula of the Red River. Its boundaries are Main Street (west), Redwood Avenue (north), the Red River (east), and the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline (south), which bisects the peninsula. The southern portion of the peninsula is the neighbourhood of South Point Douglas (which is also considered part of Downtown Winnipeg.) Together, these two neighbourhoods are known simply known as \\"Point Douglas\\". In 2001, North Point Douglas had a population of 2,260. North Point Douglas is one of the Winnipeg's oldest neighbourhoods. Today, North Point Douglas boasts two of Winnipeg's oldest houses - Barber House and Ross House Museum. It is also considered part of Winnipeg's North End. History Barber House The eastern point of the neighbourhood was a traditional gathering place for Aboriginal tribes for ceremonial rites (while The Forks nearby was traditionally used for trading purposes). This is believed to have occurred prior to European contact, and continued until urbanization in the 1870s. In 1812, this first group of Selkirk Settlers arrived in Point Douglas and began raising wheat crops on the point and along the Red River, becoming the first agrarian colony west of the Great Lakes. As the Red River Colony (as the Winnipeg region was known) grew, a small cluster of commercial establishments developed on the Fort Garry road at Point Douglas by 1862, notably those of William Fonseca and Edmond Barber. After the incorporation of the City of Winnipeg in 1873, Point Douglas developed as a neighbourhood. Several notable citizens resided there, including merchant James Ashdown and Manitoba premier John Norquay. Among the houses of these men, there developed more modest cottages, industry such as Brown and Rutherford, a lumber company established in Point Douglas in 1872. In 1881, Point Douglas was selected as the location that the Canadian Pacific Railway would cross the Red River. This move solidified Point Douglas as a choice location for industrial firms, who could take advantage of proximity to the railway. With the railroad completed by 1885, Winnipeg experienced an intense period of growth, and by 1914, Point Douglas had become a densely populated working-class neighbourhood, with many immigrants from Eastern Europe. North Point Douglas today North Point Douglas continues to be primarily a residential neighbourhood, but is also home to commercial and light industrial uses, with industry located mainly on the south side of the neighbourhood along the CPR tracks, and commercial establishments on the western side, along Main Street—one of the city's busiest thoroughfares. North Point Douglas is located immediately north of Winnipeg's downtown, and is considered part of Winnipeg's inner city. It has faced many of the same challenges that have characterized the North American city in the postwar decades: population and economic decline, crime, drug abuse, and a lack of investment. In recent years, the neighbourhood has begun to stabilize, through efforts by community groups like the Point Douglas Residents Committee and North End Community Renewal Corporation, and through new and long-time residents renovating properties. Ross House Ross House Museum Ross House had its beginnings in 1852 when construction commenced on William Ross's log home. The museum was moved to its current location at 140 Meade Street (Joe Zuken Heritage Park, Point Douglas) in 1984. The construction of Ross House is a prime example of a Red River frame building.

Background Dick Ebersol left the show after the 1984–85 season, when the network refused his request to shut the program down entirely for six months and shift much of the material onto tape, not live broadcast. Once again, NBC briefly considered cancelling the show, but programming head Brandon Tartikoff (who was something of an SNL fan) decided to continue the show and re-hire producer Lorne Michaels. In some ways, the job Michaels returned to was more challenging than the one he took on in 1975. For starters, Michaels' \\"golden boy\\" reputation was somewhat tarnished. His most recent effort, the previous season's The New Show confused critics and was ignored by audiences. Also, the 1984–85 season had been a critical and ratings hit, generating memorable characters and stand-out performers. However, Michaels would not be the only member of the old guard to return: original writers Al Franken and Tom Davis would return as producers, and Jim Downey would be head writer. Fans and critics welcomed Michaels and many of the original producers and writers back, calling it a return to the show's roots. This season featured a new logo, which was used only for this season- the title, Saturday Night Live in an all caps, graffiti-style pink lettering (not the same logo as used in season6). This is the first season to show the animated NBC \\"In Stereo Where Available\\" captioning during the opening montage. Reception The new cast failed to connect with audiences, due to the cast's inexperience in comedy. The show also featured a frustrated writing crew (including future Simpsons writers Jon Vitti, George Meyer, and John Swartzwelder), who didn't know how to write sketches for such an eclectic cast. The season was plagued by harsh criticism, low ratings, and rumours of a possible cancellation. Tartikoff planned to cancel SNL after its season finale in May 1986; Michaels, however, pleaded with Tartikoff to let the show go on, provided that Lorne find better-suited cast members for the next season. Weekend Update \\"Saturday Night News\\" was changed to its original name \\"Weekend Update\\" starting with this season. \\"Weekend Update\\" proved to be a highlight in the season, with new anchor Dennis Miller (who rarely appeared outside of \\"Update\\") becoming the most popular anchor since Chevy Chase in 1975. The only people to return to the show in the following season would be Brown, Dunn, Lovitz and Miller. Notable sketches Notable moments of season included when Chevy Chase hosted the show. Chase was not popular with the cast and crew and, according to the book Live From New York: The Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, Chase pitched an idea for a sketch that featured openly gay cast member Sweeney as a person with AIDS who is weighed by a doctor to see how much weight he lost. Another notable moment of the season was in the episode hosted by George Wendt. During the show, Francis Ford Coppola appeared in between sketches where he, Michaels and Sweeney try to fix up SNL to boost the show's sagging ratings by turning creative control over to Coppola. With the exception of the \\"Who Shot C.R.?\\" storyline back in season6, this episode marks the series' only attempt at extending a plot throughout an episode, as Oscar-winner Coppola turns out to be an incompetent director. In the season finale, Michaels invited Wayans back to perform stand up on the show, even though he had been fired from the show two months prior. Also, in the final sketch, Billy Martin is shown dumping gasoline around the studio and then setting it on fire. The entire cast is shown to be trapped in a room as a parody of TV show cliffhangers. Credits rolled with question marks on each name, signaling that the viewer didn't know which cast members would be returning the next season. Cast members were angered by an ending added to the sketch, in which Michaels has the opportunity to rescue the cast from the fire, but chooses to save only Lovitz. Cast With Ebersol's cast and writers gone, Michaels hired Academy Award nominee Randy Quaid, best known for his work in The Last Detail and National Lampoon's Vacation; as well as Joan Cusack and Robert Downey Jr. Milestones included the first black female regular, Danitra Vance (Yvonne Hudson had been a featured player in 1980 and appeared in uncredited bit parts from 1978 to 1980. Vance is also the first lesbian cast member hired on the show); Terry Sweeney, the first openly gay male cast member (and one of Jean Doumanian's writers during the show's 1980–81 season); and Anthony Michael Hall, yet another fresh face from Hollywood, who had appeared with Quaid in Vacation and starred in The Breakfast Club earlier that year. At 17 years old, Hall was the youngest male cast member, beating out Eddie Murphy, who was only 19 when he joined SNL during Jean Doumanian's turbulent, short-lived era (Murphy is still the youngest African-American male cast member). Rounding out the cast were unknowns: stand-up comedians Dennis Miller and Damon Wayans and improv comedians Nora Dunn and Jon Lovitz. Don Novello, another member of the old guard, would also return as his popular Father Guido Sarducci character. Writer A. Whitney Brown was also added to the cast mid-season and Al Franken returned in the finale. Wayans, unhappy with the parts he had been getting, decided to play the minor police officer character he'd been assigned in one sketch as a gay stereotype, though it did not fit the role. For this, Michaels fired him. According to a recent interview with short-term cast member Dan Vitale, actress Anjelica Huston was nearly hired as a cast member this season.. Huston, a friend of Lorne's, was pegged to join the show as a cast member; instead she co-hosted the season finale with Billy Martin.https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/dan-vitale-snl-interview.html Cast roster Repertory players *Joan Cusack *Robert Downey Jr. *Nora Dunn *Anthony Michael Hall *Jon Lovitz *Dennis Miller *Randy Quaid *Terry Sweeney *Danitra Vance Featured players *A.

The club's most famous VFL/AFL player Ray Gabelich played with Collingwood in the Victorian Football League during the 1950s and 1960s. Club History A group of mates were having a beer at the Alphington Hotel. Amongst the group was a Mr Lionel Pepper who at the time raised the submission that the group consider the possibility of forming a football Club. Agreeing with Mr Pepper's suggestion was a Mr Les Hanger, who subsequently called for a meeting to be held to determine the level of support and commitment towards this idea. An Invitation was posted among the Fairfield and Alphington areas inviting all interested parties wishing to assist in the formation of a new football club to attend. It was to be held at the home of Mr Reg Watson in Gillies Street Fairfield on 19 January at 6pm. The meeting was attended by 14 people and they included: Mr Frank Aston, Mr Maurice Isaacs, Mr Horry Girdwood, Mr Stan Panther, Mr Jack Reynolds, Mr Jack Smythe, Mr Reg Watson, Mr Charlie Laxton, Mr Frank Mariner, Mr Les Hanger, Mr Lionel Pepper, Mr Willis Stuchberry, Mr Harry Smith and Mr Jack Woods. The first item on the agenda was to determine if there was enough commitment and passion amongst the group to found a club. With overwhelming support amongst all attendees, the meeting then focused on forming an identity, establishing a structure and locating a playing venue. The following outcomes were then decided: The playing venue to be sought after would be Pitcher Park, as this ground had no clu linked to it. The first president would be Mr Les Triggert. The football club would be called 'Parkside'. The name chosen because Pitcher Park was located centrally in the Alphington Parklands (which extended to Bell Street). The club colors would be red and white. The original Parkside jumper was all red with a white collar and cuffs. No logo was presented and the club was to be known only as 'Parkside Football Club'. The first coach, Mr Charlie Laxton was appointed. The first captain, Mr Reg Watson was appointed. This meeting on 19 January 1934 had formed a structure and foundation which was the birth of the Parkside Football Club. The next objective was to find a competition to play in. The Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) was the preferred option but the VAFA was an extremely difficult competition to break into. It was decided by late February that the club would be represented in the Church's Football League in which it competed from 1934 to 1937. The PFC logo was introduced to the jumper in 1935. In 1936 Parkside won its first Premiership. In 1938 the club was accepted into the VAFA. Following the disbandment of the committee due to the 2nd World War, Mr Charlie Laxton, Mr Frank Jones, Mr Ray Palling and Mr Harry Smith ensured that Parkside would continue to compete through this era. The next Parkside Football Club committee was formed in 1945 with Mr Lionel Pepper elected president. Parkside Football Club's first Senior Grade Premiership in the VAFA was won in 1954, the score was Parkside 15.19.109 defeating Old Xaverians 8.12.60. This side was also a Champion team, going undefeated for the entire season. In 1959, Parkside became known as 'The Devils', a name introduced by Brian Lauder. Parkside has won Premierships in the Senior Grade competition of the VAFA in 1954, 1963, 1972, 1982 & 1988\\\\. In 1988 an historical achievement was realised with the Parkside Football Club receiving promotion to 'A' Grade in the VAFA. 2002 marked the end of a 65 years of participation in the VAFA, as the club joined the Diamond Valley Football League (DVFL) for the 2003 season. The DVFL was re-branded for the 2007 season, with a new competition formed called The Northern Football League (NFL). Rich in history and tradition, priding on its values and culture, 2008 sees us all celebrate 75 Years of the Parkside Football Club. In 2018 Parkside FC played Box Hill North in Round 1 for The Ryder Cup.

Biography She was born Maria Longworth, daughter of Joseph Longworth, in Cincinnati, Ohio into perhaps the wealthiest Episcopalian family in the city of that time. Due to her comfortable upbringing, she was immersed in the fine arts at a young age and picked up hobbies like playing piano and painting. She married the American Civil War veteran Colonel George Ward Nichols in 1868, who had been hired by her family to catalog their vast collections of artwork. Nichols was eighteen years her elder. In 1871, she was responsible for planning and raising money for the now annually celebrated Cincinnati May Festival, making her the first female in history to found a music festival in the United States. The first festival was not held until 1873, the same year she began painting china under the instruction of German immigrant and ceramic chemist Karl Langenbeck. She enrolled as a student at the School of Design, later the Art Academy of Cincinnati, that following year. She began classes in china- painting from instructor, Benn Pittman. The students' work was on display in the Women's Pavilion at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition. She attended the 1876 Centennial Exposition held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the first World's fair held in the United States. By now well along in her skill as a ceramics painter, she returned home to Cincinnati with an appreciation for Japanese art and began incorporating some of those elements into her own work. Rookwood Pottery In 1879, along with her fellow ceramics painter Mary Louise McLaughlin, Nichols commissioned the creation of an under-glaze and over-glaze kiln at a local pottery shop in Cincinnati. Nichols was also having pieces of pottery created to her specifications locally, then painting them decoratively. The following year, Nichols founded the now famous Rookwood Pottery, the first woman from Cincinnati to own such a shop. Soon she employed a modest staff consisting of both men and women, including a potter and chemist named Joseph Bailey and, as her general assistant and a china decorator, Clara Chipman Newton. She encouraged her team to be creative, use new mediums and subjects to create fine art. American pottery was considered unrefined and Maria was trying to change this perspective. One of the first pieces made was the Aladdin Vase, a large vase whose dragon and catfish motifs were inspired by Japanese art. The dragon is modeled in low relief crawling around the neck of the vase, with one of its claws hooked into the vase's opening. Nichols made the vase in 1882 in response to an earlier piece by her rival McLaughlin, the Ali Baba Vase, which was then the largest underglaze- decorated vase in America. Although not as tall as the Ali Baba Vase, the Aladdin Vase is wider, a technically more difficult feat. That same year, Nichols won a gold medal at the Tenth Cincinnati Industrial Exposition for some of her works. In 1885 George Nichols died, and by March of the following year she was remarried to a lawyer named Bellamy Storer. In the wake of her first husband's death, Storer's output had lessened considerably. In 1889 she won a gold medal at the Paris Exposition, and that same year she handed her small company over to William W. Taylor (who incorporated the small factory). The Rookwood Pottery Company is still around today. The company continues produce artisan products. The assets of the company include master molds, secret glaze formulas, notes, and the Rookwood trademark which were purchased and the company was revived by Dr. Art Townley. Dr. Townley and other investors have kept the company in the company's birthplace. Later years From 1891-95, Bellamy Storer was a member of the U.S. Congress, who became foreign minister for the United States to Belgium from 1897 to 1898. In 1896 the couple became Roman Catholics due to the recommendation of Archbishop John Ireland.Profile, patheos.com; accessed 4 February 2018. In 1900, still involved with the arts, she won a gold medal at the Universelle Exposition for her paintings on bronze mediums. In 1899 Bellamy Storer became the foreign minister of Spain, and the two convinced President William McKinley to petition Pope Leo XIII to make Archbishop Ireland a Cardinal (with the help of New York governor Theodore Roosevelt). The following year McKinley arranged for a visit with the Pope and authorized the couple to mention John Ireland for consideration. In 1902, when Roosevelt was President, he made Bellamy minister to Austria-Hungary and did not wish to involve himself in advocating for Archbishop Ireland. However, Maria continued to press the issue by meeting with members of the Vatican and leaving false impressions with others that Roosevelt backed such sentiments. These events led to the removal of Bellamy as minister, the news of which was rather scandalous at the time. Ironically, Maria's nephew, Nicholas Longworth III, came to marry Roosevelt's daughter Alice later, and Storer refused to attend the wedding.

The core hospital is located on board Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka with branch clinics serving Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Combined Arms Training Center Camp Fuji, Commander Fleet Activities Chinhae Korea, Naval Support Activity Diego Garcia, Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni and Commander Fleet Activities Sasebo. U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka staff is composed of active duty service members, U.S. Civil Servants (USCS), contract employees and Japan Master Labor Contract (MLC) employees. History The core hospital (headquarters of U.S. Naval Hospital, Yokosuka) is located on the grounds of the original hospital compound built in 1881 for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Earthquake and fire destroyed those buildings in 1923. The Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt the hospital in February 1931 as a medical center and training school. At the end of World War II, American Occupational Forces used the facility as a 250-bed hospital dispensary. On September 11, 1950, at the beginning of the Korean War, the hospital was established. The command received its first Navy Unit Commendation for treatment of over 5,800 casualties from the Korean War. A second Navy Unit Commendation was awarded for services rendered during the Vietnam War. In 1973, the base was revitalized with the arrival of the aircraft carrier USS Midway and the start of the Overseas Family Residency Program. Due to the increased importance of the Middle East and Far East theatres, a new hospital facility was built in 1980 and opened on February 10, 1981. Shortly before the hospital opened, the command received a Meritorious Unit Commendation Medal for support provided to burn patients from the Marine Corps Training Camp, Camp Fuji, Japan, in October 1979. A second Meritorious Unit Commendation Medal was awarded for superb medical support provided between July 1986 and July 1988. A third Meritorious Unit Commendation Medal was awarded in July 1994 for support provided to victims of an explosion and fire aboard USS Midway in 1990 and victims of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the Republic of Philippines in 1991. In 1999, the Navy Medicine Inspector General recognized USNH Yokosuka as a benchmark command in customer relations and marketing. USNH Yokosuka opened a joint Wellness Center at the Fleet Recreation Center in Yokosuka and the world's first Women, Infants and Children Overseas Office in 2001. After September 11, 2001 the command reengineered operational readiness training. Throughout 2002, the command strengthened force health protection for the Forward-Deployed Naval Forces and those who support them while simultaneously improving Family Centered Care.

Mansell remained an inhabitant of the college until his death on 1 May 1665. He had previously studied there and left all his property to the college.  Biography  He was born at Muddlescombe, Carmarthenshire, the third son of Sir Francis Mansel (died 1628), first of the Mansel baronets, and his first wife Catherine Morgan.Mosley, Charles ed. Burke's Peerage 107th Edition 3 Volumes Wilmington, Delaware 2003 Vol. 2 p.2394 He was educated at the Free School in Hereford and then at Jesus College, graduating Bachelor of Arts in 1611. He became Doctor of Divinity in 1624.Burke's Peerage Vol. 2 p.2394 His election as Principal of Jesus College in 1620 was in the face of strong opposition, and he apparently thought it prudent to resign a year later and wait for a more favourable opportunity. His re-election in 1630 following the death of his successor Eubele Thelwall seems to have been uncontroversial.  Civil War and Restoration  During the English Civil War he was a staunch Royalist, who attempted to raise Welsh troops for the Royalist cause, leading to his ejection from the University in 1648.Burke's Peerage Vol. 2 p.2394 He retired to Glamorgan, as did his protege (and successor as Principal of Jesus) Leoline Jenkins. They both took refuge at the house of Sir John Aubrey, first of the Aubrey baronets, at Llantrithyd, as did Gilbert Sheldon, the future Archbishop of Canterbury. Both Mansell and Jenkins remained there until 1651, when Parliament ejected Jenkins for running a \\"seditious academy\\" (in fact a private boys school), and both he and Mansell returned to Oxford. Here, due to the respect in which he was universally held, Mansell was given rooms in his old college. He was left in peace, and at the Restoration of Charles II briefly resumed the office of Principal, but due to his failing eyesight he resigned a year later in favour of Jenkins. He was possibly the Francis Mansel who, as a wine importer from Chichester, Sussex, helped King Charles II escape from England to France in 1651 after he had been on the run from the Battle of Worcester. He lent the King a ship so that he could escape to France. In character he was described as \\"strict and severe\\", but also as a man who was held in great affection and respect by his friends.

The Italian victory was based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance. At the Battle of Tug Argan (11–15 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered defenders were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General Reade Godwin-Austen had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at the same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera. The British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, a prospective Italian coup de main was made impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General Archibald Wavell, the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Background= On 9 May 1936, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini proclaimed the foundation of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, AOI), formed from the colonies of Italian Eritrea, Italian Somaliland, and Ethiopia, conquered in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (3 October 1935 – 5 May 1936). On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and France, making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. Egypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of French Somaliland (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa (Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda). The Italian General Staff (Comando Supremo) had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942; the (Italian Royal Army) and (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa. Middle East Command The Kingdom of Egypt included Sudan, a condominium between Egypt and Britain. The British had based military forces in Egypt since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which only allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt in defence of the Suez Canal. The small British and Commonwealth force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General Archibald Wavell was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the new Middle East Command, with responsibility for the Mediterranean and Middle East. Until the Franco-Italian Armistice (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in Tripolitania (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in Cyrenaica (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt. The Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about with another training in Palestine. Wavell had about at his disposal for Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor Haile Selassie, the South African General Jan Smuts (an advisor for the region with Winston Churchill), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of Arbegnoch (Amharic for Patriots), by the conference. In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the Government Code and Cypher School (GC & CS) at Bletchley Park broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME). British Somaliland The British had fought the Somaliland Campaign (1900–1920) against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and the Dervish state, to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a King's African Rifles (KAR) battalion and the Royal Air Force (RAF). The colony had an area of about with a plain inland from the coast up to deep, ending at a mountain range an average of high. There was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. Berbera, the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal entrepôt of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 GRT ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the , a strong and hot wind, blew. French Somaliland Brigadier-General Paul Legentilhomme, in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the governor, Hubert Deschamps said that he would obey instructions from the Vichy regime, Legentilhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack. The 2nd Battalion, the Black Watch was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General Gaëtan Germain (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by Pierre Nouailhetas as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September. Prelude=British defence schemes The Somaliland border was long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to the British military commander, Brigadier Arthur Chater RM, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces in time of war. During the Phoney War Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. In December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at Jirreh and Dobo, parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony. In 1940, the 631 members of the Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target. British preparations After the Armistice of Villa Incisa, the end of pro-British prevarication by Legentilhomme, led to Chater receiving orders to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable. By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment (1st NRR), the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four 3.7-inch mountain guns) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion 2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment from the Colony of Aden and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two 3-inch anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden. A Blenheim Mk I in 2015 The British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through Hargeisa or via Burao. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of the Somali Police Force () an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force. The RAF in Aden had 8 Squadron (Bristol Blenheim bombers plus two Free French Martin Marylands), 11, 39, 45 Squadron (Blenheim) and 203 Squadron (Blenheim IVF long-range fighters), 94 (Gloster Gladiator fighters), 223 Squadron (Vickers Wellesley). A Bristol Bombay of 216 Squadron participated and 84 Squadron ferried six Blenheim IFs to Aden to replace losses on 15 August. Italian plans The Italians remained suspicious of French intentions and after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine feared a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall the British, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter a British intervention. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General Guglielmo Nasi, completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives; on 14 July they predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karim and Jerato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks. The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three Blackshirt battalions and five Bande, half a company of M11/39 medium tanks and a squadron of L3/35 tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support. Lieutenant-General Carlo de Simone, issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars. The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar, by defeating the garrison and occupying British Somaliland. Because the Assa Hills rose to over , parallel to the coast about inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider. The direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road. The eastern column (Brigadier-General Arturo Bertello) would move to Odweina and Burao in the south, cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary. De Simone, with the central column would establish a base at Hargeisa and Adalek then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The western column (Lieutenant-General Sisto Bertoldi) was to advance towards Zeila to seal the border with French Somaliland and then move eastwards along the coast road towards Berbera. Battle On 31 July 18° arrived at the Scelene airstrip near Dire Dawa with six Ca 133 bomber/transport aircraft. On 1 August (CTSAO, Western Sector Tactical Command) was created for the invasion of British Somaliland. At first the CTSAO ( Collalti) had 27 bombers, 23 fighters and seven reconnaissance aircraft. During the afternoon, flights of three SM 81 bombers each, attacked shipping off Zeila as two waves of six Blenheim Mk Is from 8 and 39 squadrons, escorted by two 203 Squadron Blenheim IVFs, bombed the Italian airfield at Chinele, which had been discovered that morning. The Blenheims dived to through anti-aircraft fire as CR 42 fighters of 410° scrambled from Dire Dawa ( away) and attacked the Blenheim IVFs. As the second wave of six Blenheims arrived, Corrado Ricci, the commander of 410° , took off in his CR 32 and shot one down. As the Blenheims flew home over Zeila, the crews spotted a flight of the SM 81 bombers attacking the port. Three Blenheims broke formation and shot down one of the Italian bombers. On the morning of 2 August, 39 Squadron raided Chinele aerodrome again and were intercepted by CR 42s of 413° ; the CR 42 of the CO Corrado Santoro, was hit in the engine and force landed. On 3 August 1940, British air reconnaissance discovered that about 400 Italians had crossed the frontier at Biyad. Nasi communicated with de Simone by wireless and liaison aircraft; the central column crossed the frontier and made for Hargeisa and Tug Argan in the Assa Hills as the western column advanced on Zeila and the eastern column struck east for Odweina, to deceive the defenders and exploit opportunities. Early on 4 August the central column advanced towards Hargeisa, observed by the SCC which skirmished with the column to impose delays. In the afternoon, three SM 81s attacked Berbera and a 94 Squadron Gladiator attacked one from the 15° which reached Jijiga with one dead crewman and two wounded. On 4 August, two SM 79 bombers of 44° arrived at Dire Dawa and two of the 94 Squadron Gloster Gladiators at Berbera transferred to Laferug further south closer to Tug Argan, both strips having only small-arms for defence. There were two 3-inch anti-aircraft guns at Berbera but these were reserved for the defence of the port. During the night 216 Squadron at Aden sent a Bristol Bombay to bomb Dire Dawa but a lightning storm forced the crew to divert to Zula. On 5 August as the Italian invasion force occupied Hargeisa, covered by Ro 37bis reconnaissance aircraft of 110° Squadriglia and attacks by SM 79s on Zeila, Berbera and Aden, two more SM 79s arriving from Addis Ababa and three Ca 133s from Doghabur to participate. Flights of three Blenheims of 8 Squadron made three attacks on Italian motor columns west of Hargeisa, one Blenheim being shot down by a CR 32 of 410° . The eastern column, comprising mainly , reached Odweina on 6 August and then headed north-west toward Adadle, a village on the Tug Argan, instead of towards Burao (: Somali for a dry sandy riverbed). The SCC and small patrols of , a small force of local levies normally employed on police duties, conducted a delaying action as the other British and Commonwealth forces retreated towards Tug Argan. At 01:00 twelve light tanks advanced in line; three were hit and knocked out by Boys anti-tank rifle fire from the SCC and the company of the NRR defending the hill station. On 6 August Blenheims of 8 and 39 squadrons continued to fly reconnaissance sorties and to attack the Italian columns. An 8 Squadron Blenheim was damaged by twelve attacks by CR 42s; the Italian pilots claimed one bomber shot down and a probable. With Hargeisa captured, two CR 32s and two CR 42s arrived from Dire Dawa on 7 August and began patrols; to the south, Ca 133s flew sorties over the front. The Italians paused at Hargeisa for two days to reorganise and then resumed the advance through the Karim Pass toward the Tug Argan, in the Assa Hills. Aosta urged haste but Nasi refused to rush because the road was deteriorating under the heavy traffic and rain. The Italian advance resumed on 8 August and for two days closed up to the British defences as the Italians made preparations to attack. The defenders reported the presence of Italian medium tanks and the captain of donated the ship's QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting gun, a three-man crew and thirty rounds of ammunition. The two Gladiators at Berbera were caught on the ground at 06:00 by three Italian fighters; one Gladiator was burnt out and the other damaged; when the news reached Laferug the other two Gladiators were ordered back to Aden. Blenheim IVFs of 203 Squadron from Aden patrolled Berbera as a substitute but two SM 79s bombed the port. Around noon a Blenheim attacked three more SM 79s as they bombed Berbera, damaged one and killed a member of the crew. Three SM 81s had attacked the Godojere Pass in the morning and three Ca 133s bombed the Kerim Pass. The Ro 37bis continued to fly reconnaissance sorties and the fighter patrols were maintained; a CR 32 and a CR 42 were damaged in landing accidents at Hargeisa. In the north, the Bertoldi column captured Zeila, about north- west of Berbera, cutting communications with French Somaliland and then began a slow advance south-east along the coast road, under intermittent air attack from Aden and bombardment from the sea, pushing back the SCC rearguards as far as the village of Bulhar by 17 August. Just before Wavell left Cairo to visit London for talks, reports of the size of the invasion force led him to order most of a field artillery regiment and two anti-tank guns of the 4th Indian Infantry Division to be sent from Egypt to Somaliland by special convoy. The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the 5th Indian Infantry Division for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major- General Reade Godwin-Austen was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan. Tug Argan position From 7 to 8 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, de Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Kerim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill east of Mill Hill. The positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery, the advantage was dubious. The defenders were too few in number to cover the gap and the hills were far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority. During the morning of 9 August, three Italian fighters strafed the airfield at Berbera but found only a damaged Blenheim. The aircraft were fired on by personnel at the base and the Australian cruiser Hobart in the harbour joined in with its pom-pom guns. The Gladiator damaged the day before was dismantled and taken to Aden. On 10 August the Italian northern column reached Zeila despite naval bombardments and bombing from aircraft flying from Aden; the column was eventually stopped by its vehicle tyres being damaged by the rough ground. Battle of Tug Argan The Australians from Hobart, with their Hotchkiss gun, arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled to load, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted. The battle for Tug Argan began and another two CR 32 and a CR 42 were sent from Dire Dawa to Hargeisa along with a Ca 133 of 53° ; five SM 79s from Addis Ababa were transferred to Dire Dawa. Early in the morning 8 Squadron sent three Blenheims to dive bomb Italian troops at Tug Argan, one being damaged by a CR 42. In the afternoon another three Blenheims bombed the village of Dubato; two of the Blenheims collided on the return journey and crashed in flames. On 11 August a morning attack was made by Six Ca 133s and three SM 81s on the Godojere Pass, a SM 81 being shot down by ground fire. Three CR 42s strafed Laferug and a SM 79 bombed the airstrip afterwards. A Blenheim was claimed shot down by Italian troops but no loss appeared in British records. On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. At dawn a couple of Blenheims from 11 and 39 squadrons from Aden bombed Italian artillery around Darboruk against anti-aircraft fire then the 11 Squadron Blenheim was bounced by a CR 42 and damaged while the crew were trying to drop a message for British troops. The 39 Squadron machine was also attacked and made an emergency landing at Berbera. About two hours later three 39 Squadron Blenheims arrived to repeat the attack and the formation leader was attacked by a 410° CR 32. The pilot of the third Blenheim saw the attack, jettisoned bombs and attacked the Italian fighter, which made a head-on attack, wounding the Blenheim pilot and killed the observer. The pilot managed to reach Berbera and crash-land; the Italian pilot was also wounded. During the attack, a Blenheim IVF of 203 Squadron patrolled Berbera and tried to intercept three SM 79s but broke off the pursuit when a hit in the cockpit, wounded the pilot and navigator. Italian aircraft provided ground support all day, six Ca 133s bombing Mandera and Laferug. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery howitzers were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap. On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. On 13 August the aircraft of CTSAO concentrated on the area to the east of Adadleh; the Jerato Pass was bombed by Ca 233s and the crashed Blenheims at Berbera were strafed twice by CR 32s, one on the second attack being hit by small-arms fire and landing inside British-held territory. Another three SM 81s were transferred from Shashamane (south of Addis Ababa) to Dire Dawa. Italian outflanking moves at Tug Argan led the British to begin a withdrawal to Berbera. Eleven 223 Squadron Wellesleys were sent to reinforce the RAF at Aden. On 14 August, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta, Italian troops of the western column reported air attacks at Zeila and on a column advancing down the coast road towards Berbera, one bomber being claimed shot down but no losses appearing in RAF records. SM 79s attacked shipping off Bulhar, three SM 81s and three Ca 133s bombed a fort near the Godojere Pass and retreating troops on the road to Berbera nearby. Three CR 32s attacked road transport at Laferug, Mandera and tracks to Berbera. At Tug Argan a counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply. The Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. Godwin-Austen informed Henry Wilson, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) British Troops in Egypt of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo. Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left, either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin- Austen to withdraw from the colony. Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday. Retreat to Berbera On 15 August, CTSAO bombers continued to fly sorties in support of the army. Three Ca 133s bombed around Laferug and three SM 79s bombed troops around Berbera. Six Blenheim I bombers flew from Iraq to reinforce the RAF at Aden and on passing Kamaran Island an SM 81 flew underneath the formation. The Blenheims dived on the bomber and three achieved firing positions, shooting it down. On landing the crews handed over their aircraft and returned to Iraq in Bombay transports the next day. After a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The CTSAO concentrated its operations against the port and in a dawn attack two SM 81 bombers attacked ships in the harbour and were damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Two SM 79s bombed at noon and one was also damaged by anti-aircraft fire. The third Italian raid, by three SM 79s met two Martin Marylands from the Free French flight in 8 Squadron, which were patrolling Berbera and one Maryland pilot claimed a SM 79 shot down; it was not confirmed but crashed in flames soon after. The CTSAO at Dire Dawa was reinforced by two SM 79s of 44° and three CR 32s from 411° at Addis Ababa and three SM 81s from Shashamanna. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the Italian forces but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan. Five Blenheims bombed the captured landing ground at Hargeisa and five Ca 133s with two CR 32 fighter escorts bombed the British residency at Sheikh. A 39 Squadron Blenheim on a reconnaissance sortie, was hit by ground fire and came down in the sea, the crew being rescued by the cruiser . As the Italian invasion neared completion, three SM 81s of the 4° went back to Shashamanna, two of the SM 79s of 44° went back to Addis Ababa and three more SM 79s of 10° 28° arrived from Gura in Eritrea after the 10° had exchanged it SM 81s from reinforcements of SM 79s being flown from Libya. In Aden 39 Sauadron gave up two Blenheims to 11 Squadron so that each had five operational bombers. Evacuation The Royal Navy had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials; on 16 August, the British started to embark troops. Attacks by the on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel Chakdina suffered splinter damage. On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser Ceres and halted by gunfire. After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. At 05:35 on 18 August three 11 Squadron Blenheims bombed Italian vehicles near Laferug and were intercepted by two CR 32s of 410° , which shot down a Blenheim in flames. the crew parachuted but two of the men died in hospital of burns. Soon after the Blenheims took off, five Wellesleys from 223 Squadron flew from Perim Island and bombed Addis Ababa airfield in bad weather. A CR 42 managed to damage four of the Wellesleys whose crews claimed two hangars destroyed, two damaged, four SM 79s destroyed, two damaged and Aosta's runabout destroyed. Italian records show a SM 79, a S 75 and three Ca 133s destroyed, one SM 79 and a SM 81 damaged. Two attacks on Berbera were made by SM 79s during the morning and three SM 79s escorted by two CR 42s attacked soon after noon, the fighters driving a Blenheim F away. Italian troops overcame the second British defensive position before Berbera. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, Hobart, with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug Queen was the only British ship lost in the operation. The Navy embarked them being front-line troops, and . Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped. SCC members who were embarked, became an armoured car unit under the same title. There was little Italian interference with the evacuation, perhaps because on 15 August Aosta had ordered Nasi to allow the British to evacuate without too much fighting, in the hope of a peace agreement being mediated through the Vatican. The last CTSAO raid was flown against Berbera by three SM 79s; soon afterwards, British aircraft from Aden attacked Italian troops as they occupied the town that evening. Much of Berbera was on fire and the wreckage of four British aircraft were found on the airfield. Mussolini annexed the colony to the AOI, as part of the Italian Empire. Aftermath=Analysis The Italians had shown the ability to coordinate columns separated by many miles of desert; the forces under British command had kept their discipline during the retreat and preserved most of their men. British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of England, British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and Kassala in Sudan, Moyale and Buna in Kenya. News of the evacuation came as a shock to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwin-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly. The British had to immobilise and abandon 350 vehicles and most of their stores because of the need to ferry everything to the ships offshore. From 5 to 19 August the RAF at Aden flew 184 sorties and dropped of bombs. From 16 to 19 August, the RAF flew 12 reconnaissance sorties, 19 bomber-reconnaissance sorties, 72 bomber sorties against Italian troops and transport and 36 fighter sorties over Berbera of the total. The British learned that inadequately defended airstrips could quickly be made untenable, leaving bombers flying from Aden unprotected against air attack. Despite the land campaign, a convoy sailed the Red Sea early in August and another convoy began the voyage on 19 August escorted by 14 Squadron Wellesleys as the Blenheim IVFs were busy over Berbera. After the British evacuation, both sides dispersed aircraft sent to reinforce the local units, the CTSAO being disbanded on 26 August. Winston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been vigorously defended and proposed a court of enquiry. Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage Churchill was said by General John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), to have been moved to \\"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell. In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the Battle of Britain and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to defeated generals. Adolf Hitler called the evacuation of the colony a \\"hard blow\\" but The capture of the colony was the greatest success of the Italians in the East African campaign but they had not been able to exploit the opportunities that they had created. Delays caused by the terrain, weather and the cancellation of a by Italian 300 infantry on the port enabled the British to get away, despite the improvised nature of the embarkation. Casualties In 1954, Ian Playfair, the British official historian, wrote that the British suffered 260 casualties and estimated Italian losses of 2,052 men. Seven British aircraft were shot down and ten were badly damaged in the fourteen days' fighting. In 1988, Alberto Rovighi, the Italian official historian, wrote that the Italians suffered 465 men killed, 1,530 wounded and 34 missing, a total of 2,029 men, of whom 161 were Italian and 1,868 were in local Eritrean and Somali Ascari units of the . Somali irregulars supporting the British suffered about another 2,000 casualties during the invasion and occupation; about 1,000 Somali irregulars became casualties fighting on the Italian side. In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that 38 of the British casualties had been killed and 222 wounded. In a 1996 publication, Christopher Shores gave the same figures for Italian casualties as Maravigna and wrote that the RAF lost seven aircraft and had ten damaged. In 2007, Andrea Molinari recorded 1,995 Italian casualties and four aircraft destroyed. Subsequent operations On 16 March 1941, the British executed Operation Appearance from Aden; the two Sikh battalions of the Indian Army, that had been part of the defence force in August 1940 and a Somali commando detachment, were landed on either side of Berbera from transports escorted by , Caledon, Kandahar and Kingston. The invasion by the Sikhs was the first successful Allied landing on an occupied beach of the war; few men of the Italian 70th Colonial Brigade offered resistance. Repairs began on the port and supplies for the 11th African Division were passing through within a week, reducing the road transport distance by . The British re-captured the whole of British Somaliland and on 8 April, Chater was appointed Military Governor.

Billingsley (center table right) among the celebrities in the Stork Club's Cub Room (November 1944) Life and career John Sherman Billingsley was the youngest child of Robert Billingsley and Emily Collingsworth. He was born in Enid, Oklahoma, on March 10, 1896.\\"Billingsley\\" American National Biography: Baker-Blatch, Oxford University Press, 1999, Page 775 (In later years, Billingsley claimed to have been born in 1900, but this is refuted by both the 1930 census and the Social Security Death Index.) His parents had settled in Enid following the 1893 land run. The Billingsley children attended school in a one-room schoolhouse, riding a horse to get to school. When an older brother committed a homicide and was sent to prison, the family relocated to Anadarko to be near him. Upon the brother's release, he enlisted Sherman as an assistant in his bootlegging business. The family moved again, this time to Oklahoma City, where Sherman was again drawn into the bootlegging business by another of his older brothers. This business extended into Omaha, Toledo, and Detroit. In Detroit at age 18, Billingsley was arrested and convicted on federal charges. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and spent time in Leavenworth before his conviction was reversed. When his brother ran out on his Detroit mob partners, he left for New York, with Sherman joining him within a short time. Billingsley began buying drug stores in New York City and even started his own real estate office to help him acquire drug stores. He created and owned the Stork Club. From the time of the speakeasy until the 1960s, he held court on East 53rd Street. According to Ralph Blumenthal in his 2000 book, Stork Club, another New York nightclub owner named Mary Louise Cecilia Guinan, widely known as Texas Guinan, introduced Billingsley to her friend, commentator Walter Winchell, in 1930. In his column in the New York Daily Mirror, Winchell called the Stork Club \\"New York's New Yorkiest place on W. 58th\\". Billingsley offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the return of his son-in-law, Alexander I. Rorke, Jr., in 1963, when his plane disappeared over the Caribbean. One of Billingsley's mistresses in the late 1930s was actress Ethel Merman.Brian Kellow, Ethel Merman: A Life (Viking, 2007), pg. 70 His nephew, Glenn Billingsley, was married to Leave It to Beaver actress Barbara Billingsley. (The actress should not be confused with Sherman Billingsley's daughter Barbara, who like his other children, sometimes figured in publicity about the nightclub.)

Its major stores are Target, Lowe's, Landmark Theatres, and a branch of the Indianapolis Public Library. History Glendale Shopping Center was planned in 1955 by Howard M. Landau, along with representatives of William H. Block Co. and L. S. Ayres, two Indianapolis-based department stores which would serve as the mall's anchor stores. Each department store was to be positioned at the opposite end of a mall concourse which would contain about 45 stores in total. The site chosen for the mall was along Keystone Avenue at 62nd Street. Representatives of the William H. Block Co. chain said that they felt that the location was suitably positioned for the city's growth at the time, and that having both department stores in the same center would offer a greater shopping variety for customers. Victor Gruen was the mall's architect. When the Glendale Shopping Center opened, it was the premier retail center in Indianapolis and boasted an impressive array of upscale retailers. It was converted to a covered mall in the 1960s. Until Glendale's construction, most major department stores in Indianapolis were located only in the Downtown district. Glendale was frequently the first local branch store away from the established flagship locations downtown. Following the opening of The Fashion Mall at Keystone north, Glendale began to lose many of its better-known tenants. The original mall was demolished March 1, 2007. New construction and design returned it to being an open-air shopping center in early 2008. The complex is currently owned by Kite Realty.

Her early work was loosely associated with conceptual art and minimalism, however, she is best known for her abstract dripped, splashed and poured \\"Waterfall\\" paintings, which she started in the 1980s, and for her later site-specific wall drawings. Steir has had retrospectives and exhibitions all over the world, including the Tate Gallery in London, and shows at the Brooklyn Museum and the New Museum of Contemporary Art that traveled throughout Europe. She has won numerous awards for her work, and is thoroughly represented in major museum collections in the United States and abroad, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Tate Gallery. She is a founding board member of Printed Matter bookshop in New York City, and of the landmark feminist journal, Heresies, first published in 1977. Steir has also taught art at Parsons School of Design, Princeton University and Hunter College. She has lived and worked primarily in New York City as an adult. She lives in Greenwich Village.Kurutz, Steven. \\"What Do Anna Wintour and Bob Dylan Have in Common? This Secret Garden\\", The New York Times, September 28, 2016. Accessed November 3, 2016. \\"The house is part of the Macdougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District, a landmarked community of 21 row homes, with 11 lining Macdougal Street and 10 running parallel on Sullivan Street.\\" Early life and education Steir was born Iris Patricia Sukoneck in 1940 in Newark, New Jersey. She attended the Pratt Institute in New York (1956–1958), where she was influenced by her teachers Richard Lindner and Phillip Guston, and Boston University College of Fine Arts (1958–1960). Steir returned to Pratt and earned a BFA degree in 1962. Career=Early years Pat Steir, Nothing, oil on canvas, 1974, Honolulu Museum of Art In 1962, the year she graduated from art school, Steir was included in a group show at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1964, her work was in a show called “Drawings” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her first one- person exhibition was at the Terry Dintenfass Gallery, New York, in 1964. During that time, she worked in New York as an illustrator and a book designer (1962–1966). Between 1966–1969, Steir was an art director at Harper & Row publishing company, New York. Around 1970 she became friends with Sol LeWitt, Lawrence Weiner, and other conceptual artists, and she made the first of many trips to New Mexico to visit Agnes Martin. She rose to fame in the 1970s with monochromatic canvases of roses and other images that were X-ed out. The artist explained, “I wanted to destroy images as symbols. To make the image a symbol for a symbol. I had to act it out―make the image and cross it out. …no imagery, but at the same time endless imagery. Every nuance of paint texture worked as an image.”Dominique-Lévy Gallery Nothing from 1974, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an example of this phase of the artist's work. Mature work Wind and Water, color soap ground aquatint with soap ground aquatint reversal, spit bite aquatint and drypoint, 1996. Steir's first museum exhibition, in 1973 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., marks the beginning of a career dense with painting exhibitions. She has also made installation work (shown at Documenta IX, Kassel, Germany, in 1992) and is an important printmaker. Crown Point Press began publishing her prints in 1977 and in 1983 the Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, gave her a print and drawing exhibition. A print retrospective at the Cabinet des Estampes in Geneva traveled to the Tate Gallery in London, England. Steir has had one-person painting exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum in 1984 and the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York in 1987, both of which traveled to other museums, many in Europe. In the late 1980s, Steir became influenced by the artists John Cage and Agnes Martin and began producing dripped, splashed and poured works, embracing the element of chance. The artist relates this work to the 8th and 9th century Chinese Yipin \\"ink-splashing\\" painters,Cheim and Read Gallery having studied ink splash in the harmony of nature and humanity, inspired by Tibetan philosophy. Wind and Water is an example of this phase of her work. In 1989–92 Steir began limiting her colors to monochrome. In 1995, the monograph Pat Steir was published by the American art critic Thomas McEvilley, chronicling the artists' life work up to that point. In November 1999, Steir was the subject of an Art in America cover feature, \\"Watercourse Way,\\" by critic G. Roger Denson, who wrote that Steir's lyrical waterfall paintings attest to her long-standing interest in Asian art and thought, particularly the ancient Chinese philosophy of Daoism, with Steir's literal and figurative motif embodying the flow of water (or in her case, paint) down a surface. Describing Steir's 2010 installation at Sue Scott Gallery, The Nearly Endless Line, which consisted of a white line snaking around the gallery's blue-black walls, lit with blue light, Sharon Butler writes in The Brooklyn Rail, \\"Walking through the darkened space, observers find themselves inside Steir’s painting, where they become part of the illusion she has created with paint and light.\\" Pat Steir said \\"I wanted to be a great artist, again not in slang in someone who is great. But in the fantastic, reaching the soul of other people.\\" Awards Steir has received many public honors for her work. She was the recipient of Individual Artist (1973) and Art in Public Institutions (1976) grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts in 1982. Both of her alma maters have recognized her: Pratt, with an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Art (1991) and a 2008 Alumni Achievement Award for “outstanding graduates who have distinguished themselves in their fields,\\" and Boston University, with a Distinguished Alumni Award (2001). In 2016, Steir was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Exhibitions Installation Image \\"For Philadelphia\\" exhibition (2014) In a career spanning over fifty years, Steir has exhibited at a large number of galleries and institutions, throughout the U.S. and internationally. Selected galleries where she has had solo exhibitions include: Terry Dintenfass Gallery, Max Protech Gallery, Crown Point Press, M. Knoedler & Co., Victoria Miro Gallery, Robert Miller Gallery, Cheim & Read, Locks Gallery, and Lévy Gorvy. Selected museums and institutions that have held retrospectives and exhibitions of her work include: Ball State University, Corcoran Gallery of Art (1973); Spencer Museum of Art, Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston (1983); Brooklyn Museum (1984); Cincinnati Art Museum, Philadelphia College of Art (1985); Museum of Fine Arts Bern, The New Museum of Contemporary Art, The Baltimore Museum of Art (1987); Musée d'art contemporain de Lyon (1990); and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum (2010). *Silent Secret Waterfalls: The Barnes Series, Barnes Foundation, 2019. *Pat Steir: Color Wheel, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, 2019.

In peacetime before and after the war she carried fruit and passengers; in war she supplied troops and ships in the field. In 1958 she was sold to a German shipping line, and in 1971 she was scrapped after 39 years' service. Building and pre-war service The Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia built the ship as SS Chiriqui for United Fruit Company in 1932. She was one of six UFC sister ships driven by turbo-electric transmission. Chiriquis peacetime service was in carrying fruit, passengers and mail on regular liner services between Central America and the USA. US Navy service The US Navy bareboat chartered her through the Maritime Commission on 4 June 1941. Brewer's Drydock Co. of Staten Island, New York converted her for Navy use and she was commissioned on 14 June 1941, commanded by Cmdr J.M. Connally. Neutrality period operations Tarazed loaded supplies sailed to North Carolina to supply ships of the Neutrality Patrol. After returning to New York City, she left late in August for a voyage to Iceland to resupply US and Royal Navy ships. World War II North Atlantic operations When the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, Tarazed was at Halifax, Nova Scotia preparing to join another convoy to Iceland. Upon completion of the voyage she went to Baltimore, Maryland, for an extensive overhaul before making resupply runs to Newfoundland, Iceland and Bermuda. In July 1942 Tarazed reached Boston, Massachusetts, from Nova Scotia and loaded a cargo for Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Panama. On 21 September she returned to Baltimore with a cargo of sugar. She continued supply runs from Baltimore or Norfolk, Virginia, to the Caribbean until mid-1943. Supporting the invasion of North Africa On 8 June 1943 Tarazed joined Task Force 65 at Norfolk – headed for North Africa – and arrived at Mers el Kebir, Algeria, on 22 June. She partially unloaded there and, on the 30th, took the rest of her cargo to Oran. On 4 July, Tarazed left for the US in convoy GUS-9. She reached Norfolk, VA on 23 July, was replenished, and left for Bermuda. After supplying Bermuda and Cuba she returned to the US, reaching Bayonne, New Jersey, on 13 August. Eight days later Tarazed left for North Africa, reaching Mers el Kebir on 2 September. After calling at Bizerte and Algiers, she returned to the US in convoy GUS-15 and arrived at Norfolk on 4 October. Late that month, she joined convoy UGS-22 to take materiel to Oran, Bizerte and Palermo. Then, with the exception of a voyage to the Mediterranean in April, she took provisions to the Caribbean in the first five months of 1944. Supporting the invasion of southern France In June, Tarazed delivered provisions to ships in the ports of Plymouth, Swansea and Portland Harbour in Britain and at Belfast in Northern Ireland. She steamed from Norfolk on 24 August and arrived at Oran on 4 September to supply ships supporting the invasion of southern France. She continued logistics runs to the Mediterranean into April 1945 and turned to supplying bases and ports in the Caribbean until 14 December 1945 when she was ordered to report to the 8th Naval District for disposal. Military honors and awards Tarazed received one battle star for World War II. Post-war decommissioning Tarazed was decommissioned on 4 January 1946, was returned to United Fruit through the War Shipping Administration at New Orleans, Louisiana, the same day and was struck from the Navy list on 21 January 1946. Post-war service United Fruit restored the ship's pre-war name Chiriqui to her. In 1958 United Fruit sold her to Union-Partenreederei T/S of Bremen, Germany, which also acquired her United Fruit sister ship Jamaica. Union- Partenreederei changed Chiriquis name to D/S Blexen.

The genre has increased in popularity as the baby boomers have aged and female readers have sought characters to identify with. Subjects are often romantic in nature, and heroines are usually between the ages of 45 and 65. Matron lit characters were often married at one point, but are no longer with their spouses or living with their children. There are usually feminist themes in matron literature, though some works are more overtly feminist than others. Matron literature has only recently become prominent. It can be regarded as a sub-category of boomer lit, although it originated as an offshoot of chick lit, which became quite popular in the late 1990s.Johnston, Laura. \\"Not Just for 20-somethings...\\" The idea of matron literature being chick lit for older women contributed to the alternative term hen lit for the movement. Since matron lit first began, it increased in scope; there are now industry publishing houses devoted solely to matron literature. Authors of matron literature tend to themselves be women of similar age to their heroines, but are not exclusively so. Works by authors such as Larry McMurtry also are part of the genre.Gardner, Marilyn. \\"In this new genre...\\" Many matron lit authors have developed popular series of books revolving around the same characters, like Joan Medlicott's Ladies of Covington.

On linguistic markets, linguistic capital—a subtype of the broader concept of cultural capital according to Pierre Bourdieu—is exchanged, and different languages and varieties have different symbolic values. Different linguistic varieties are assigned market values and various prices that are either positive or negative. Much of these values is based on connotation for the linguistic variety. The highest market values are assigned to varieties that are rare and desirable in the marketplace. The highest of these is considered legitimate speech. This desire for legitimate speech stems from the education system because it is closely connected to economic growth which relates economic markets to linguistic ones because society converts desirable careers to desirable speech. Linguistic exchange exists on three main levels: # Between the audience and the text # Within the content of the text # Between texts found in a common group On the standard linguistic market, standard languages usually enjoy more value due to the high overt prestige associated with them while on linguistic markets that value non-standard varieties, vernaculars can also enjoy a higher value. This concept has been proven to be useful in understanding other sociolinguistic concepts such as language variation and change and gender. Society at large is considered to be the macro-market for language application, however within society exist several micro-markets. Examples of micro-markets include families and peer groups. Values in micro-markets can vary significantly from the value in the macro-market for a particular variety. For example, many youth may use slang or other language that is particular to a peer group; in that micro-market, that language has a high-market value, however, in the macro-market of society this language value is much lower. Many researchers have attempted to create new index's to represent the economic parallel that exists within the field of linguistics. David Sankoff and Suzanne Laberge developed an index to specifically measure how speakers' activity within the linguistic market is related to the speakers' knowledge or application of the legitimate speech for the market.

The club has been known as Northcote Park since 1952 and play their home matches at Bill Lawry Oval, Northcote. Northcote Park have won a total of 17 premierships (5 as Prince of Wales FC). Their premiership years were 1947 to 1951, 1957, 1977 to 1979, 1985, 1994, 1997, 1999 to 2002, and 2012.  Original name The club formed as the Prince of Wales Football Club and was affiliated with the Methodist Football Association, playing their home matches at McDonell Park. Between 1947 and 1951, Prince of Wales FC won five consecutive premierships. Name change In 1952 the club changed its name to Northcote Park on transferring to the Sub District Football Association. After that competition folded after the 1953 season the club moved to the Metropolitan Football League. The Cougars won their first premiership in the Metropolitan League in 1957, then transferred to the PHFL in 1973 where the club won three consecutive premierships from 1977 to 1979. The search for stronger competition again led the club to move leagues again, this time to the Diamond Valley Football League (DVFL). The League formed a Division Two in 1981 and the club along with fellow new affiliates West Preston, Bundoora and Reservoir and the bottom four clubs from the 1980 DVFL season formed the new Division Two. Northcote Park's first DVFL premiership was the 1985 Division Two flag and as a result the club was promoted to Division One in 1986, but the Cougars were relegated that same season. In 1994 Northcote Park won their second Division Two premiership and have remained in Division One since. Relocation In 1987, Northcote Football Club dropped out of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) and was placed into liquidation, meaning Westgarth St was left without a tenant. Consequently, in 1989, Northcote Park relocated to Westgarth St from McDonell Park. In 1996, in partnership with the Darebin City Council, the club embarked on a major redevelopment of the ground, which included extending the club rooms and the viewing area, as well as constructing new change rooms and a gymnasium. With a revamped facility at the premier venue in Northcote, the Cougars started to dominate the DVFL, winning Division One premierships in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2012. The feat of four successive premierships, from 1999 to 2002, has only recently being equalled by Heidelberg from 2006 to 2009. Improved lighting was installed at Bill Lawry Oval in 2012, making it possible for night footy on Friday or Saturday nights. The club also fields junior teams, formerly known as Alphington Cougars Football Club, and now known as Northcote Junior Football Club. They play in the Yarra Junior Football League. The club also fields several women's teams.

Distinct interpretations of this type of presentation could be sensory processing disorder involving differences in the way a person reacts to sensory input which is regarded as a pervasive developmental disorder related to the autism spectrum; or there is an alternative psychological concept of 'innate sensitiveness' as a personality trait coined by Carl Jung later developed into the highly sensitive person trait.

Amplification is not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. The somatosensory amplification scale (SAS) has been validated to measure amplification.

Richard A. Lupoff was the editor for publishers Jack Biblo and Jack Tannen. After many years of operating their lower Manhattan bookstore, Biblo and Tannen Booksellers, at 63 Fourth Avenue, the two began a publishing subsidiary, named Biblo and Tannen, to republish out-of-print historical novels that were purchased mainly by school libraries. They also reprinted books on archaeology, including Arthur Evans's The Palace of Minos at Knossos. Reprints They launched another subsidiary, Canaveral Press, giving it a name identified with space exploration underway at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Under that imprint, Biblo and Tannen published a line of Burroughs books. Most were reprints of Edgar Rice Burroughs novels on which the copyright had lapsed, but in April 1963, the firm acquired the rights to unpublished Burroughs manuscripts. Canaveral was on good terms with the Burroughs heirs, and several Canaveral Burroughs titles are legitimate first editions of material not previously published in book form and in some cases not previously published at all. To illustrate the Burroughs novels, Lupoff brought into Canaveral several leading illustrators of the 1950s and 1960s, notably Reed Crandall, Frank Frazetta and Roy G. Krenkel.

Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer. This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, and in cases where the overflow was triggered by mistake, will often cause the program to crash or operate incorrectly. Stack buffer overflow is a type of the more general programming malfunction known as buffer overflow (or buffer overrun). Overfilling a buffer on the stack is more likely to derail program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls. A stack buffer overflow can be caused deliberately as part of an attack known as stack smashing. If the affected program is running with special privileges, or accepts data from untrusted network hosts (e.g. a webserver) then the bug is a potential security vulnerability. If the stack buffer is filled with data supplied from an untrusted user then that user can corrupt the stack in such a way as to inject executable code into the running program and take control of the process. This is one of the oldest and more reliable methods for attackers to gain unauthorized access to a computer. (dead link) Exploiting stack buffer overflows The canonical method for exploiting a stack-based buffer overflow is to overwrite the function return address with a pointer to attacker- controlled data (usually on the stack itself). This is illustrated with \`strcpy()\` in the following example: #include void foo(char *bar) { char c[12]; strcpy(c, bar); // no bounds checking } int main(int argc, char **argv) { foo(argv[1]); return 0; } This code takes an argument from the command line and copies it to a local stack variable \`c\`. This works fine for command-line arguments smaller than 12 characters (as you can see in figure B below). Any arguments larger than 11 characters long will result in corruption of the stack. (The maximum number of characters that is safe is one less than the size of the buffer here because in the C programming language, strings are terminated by a null byte character. A twelve-character input thus requires thirteen bytes to store, the input followed by the sentinel zero byte. The zero byte then ends up overwriting a memory location that's one byte beyond the end of the buffer.) The program stack in \`foo()\` with various inputs: { valign=\\"top\\" A. - Before data is copied. valign=\\"top\\" B. - \\"hello\\" is the first command line argument. valign=\\"top\\" C. - \\"A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​\\\\x08​\\\\x35​\\\\xC0​\\\\x80\\" is the first command line argument. } Notice in figure C above, when an argument larger than 11 bytes is supplied on the command line \`foo()\` overwrites local stack data, the saved frame pointer, and most importantly, the return address. When \`foo()\` returns it pops the return address off the stack and jumps to that address (i.e. starts executing instructions from that address). Thus, the attacker has overwritten the return address with a pointer to the stack buffer \`char c[12]\`, which now contains attacker-supplied data. In an actual stack buffer overflow exploit the string of \\"A\\"'s would instead be shellcode suitable to the platform and desired function. If this program had special privileges (e.g. the SUID bit set to run as the superuser), then the attacker could use this vulnerability to gain superuser privileges on the affected machine. The attacker can also modify internal variable values to exploit some bugs. With this example: #include #include void foo(char *bar) { float My_Float = 10.5; // Addr = 0x0023FF4C char c[28]; // Addr = 0x0023FF30 // Will print 10.500000 printf(\\"My Float value = %f \\", My_Float); /* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Memory map: @ : c allocated memory # : My_Float allocated memory *c *My_Float 0x0023FF30 0x0023FF4C @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@##### foo(\\"my string is too long !!!!! XXXXX\\"); memcpy will put 0x1010C042 (little endian) in My_Float value. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*/ memcpy(c, bar, strlen(bar)); // no bounds checking... // Will print 96.031372 printf(\\"My Float value = %f \\", My_Float); } int main(int argc, char **argv) { foo(\\"my string is too long !!!!! \\\\x10\\\\x10\\\\xc0\\\\x42\\"); return 0; } Platform-related differences A number of platforms have subtle differences in their implementation of the call stack that can affect the way a stack buffer overflow exploit will work. Some machine architectures store the top-level return address of the call stack in a register. This means that any overwritten return address will not be used until a later unwinding of the call stack. Another example of a machine-specific detail that can affect the choice of exploitation techniques is the fact that most RISC-style machine architectures will not allow unaligned access to memory. Combined with a fixed length for machine opcodes, this machine limitation can make the jump to ESP technique almost impossible to implement (with the one exception being when the program actually contains the unlikely code to explicitly jump to the stack register). Stacks that grow up Within the topic of stack buffer overflows, an often-discussed-but-rarely-seen architecture is one in which the stack grows in the opposite direction. This change in architecture is frequently suggested as a solution to the stack buffer overflow problem because any overflow of a stack buffer that occurs within the same stack frame cannot overwrite the return pointer. Further investigation of this claimed protection finds it to be a naïve solution at best. Any overflow that occurs in a buffer from a previous stack frame will still overwrite a return pointer and allow for malicious exploitation of the bug. For instance, in the example above, the return pointer for \`foo\` will not be overwritten because the overflow actually occurs within the stack frame for \`memcpy\`. However, because the buffer that overflows during the call to \`memcpy\` resides in a previous stack frame, the return pointer for \`memcpy\` will have a numerically higher memory address than the buffer. This means that instead of the return pointer for \`foo\` being overwritten, the return pointer for \`memcpy\` will be overwritten. At most, this means that growing the stack in the opposite direction will change some details of how stack buffer overflows are exploitable, but it will not reduce significantly the number of exploitable bugs. Protection schemes Over the years, a number of control-flow integrity schemes have been developed to inhibit malicious stack buffer overflow exploitation. These may usually be classified into three categories: * Detect that a stack buffer overflow has occurred and thus prevent redirection of the instruction pointer to malicious code. * Prevent the execution of malicious code from the stack without directly detecting the stack buffer overflow. * Randomize the memory space such that finding executable code becomes unreliable. Stack canaries Stack canaries, named for their analogy to a canary in a coal mine, are used to detect a stack buffer overflow before execution of malicious code can occur. This method works by placing a small integer, the value of which is randomly chosen at program start, in memory just before the stack return pointer. Most buffer overflows overwrite memory from lower to higher memory addresses, so in order to overwrite the return pointer (and thus take control of the process) the canary value must also be overwritten. This value is checked to make sure it has not changed before a routine uses the return pointer on the stack. This technique can greatly increase the difficulty of exploiting a stack buffer overflow because it forces the attacker to gain control of the instruction pointer by some non-traditional means such as corrupting other important variables on the stack. Nonexecutable stack Another approach to preventing stack buffer overflow exploitation is to enforce a memory policy on the stack memory region that disallows execution from the stack (W^X, \\"Write XOR Execute\\"). This means that in order to execute shellcode from the stack an attacker must either find a way to disable the execution protection from memory, or find a way to put their shellcode payload in a non-protected region of memory. This method is becoming more popular now that hardware support for the no-execute flag is available in most desktop processors. While this method definitely makes the canonical approach to stack buffer overflow exploitation fail, it is not without its problems. First, it is common to find ways to store shellcode in unprotected memory regions like the heap, and so very little need change in the way of exploitation. Even if this were not so, there are other ways. The most damning is the so-called return to libc method for shellcode creation. In this attack the malicious payload will load the stack not with shellcode, but with a proper call stack so that execution is vectored to a chain of standard library calls, usually with the effect of disabling memory execute protections and allowing shellcode to run as normal. This works because the execution never actually vectors to the stack itself. A variant of return-to-libc is return-oriented programming (ROP), which sets up a series of return addresses, each of which executes a small sequence of cherry-picked machine instructions within the existing program code or system libraries, sequence which ends with a return. These so-called gadgets each accomplish some simple register manipulation or similar execution before returning, and stringing them together achieves the attacker's ends. It is even possible to use \\"returnless\\" return-oriented programming by exploiting instructions or groups of instructions that behave much like a return instruction. Randomization Instead of separating the code from the data, another mitigation technique is to introduce randomization to the memory space of the executing program. Since the attacker needs to determine where executable code that can be used resides, either an executable payload is provided (with an executable stack) or one is constructed using code reuse such as in ret2libc or return-oriented programming (ROP). Randomizing the memory layout will, as a concept, prevent the attacker from knowing where any code is. However, implementations typically will not randomize everything; usually the executable itself is loaded at a fixed address and hence even when ASLR (address space layout randomization) is combined with a nonexecutable stack the attacker can use this fixed region of memory. Therefore, all programs should be compiled with PIE (position-independent executables) such that even this region of memory is randomized. The entropy of the randomization is different from implementation to implementation and a low enough entropy can in itself be a problem in terms of brute forcing the memory space that is randomized.

If language change is taking place, the apparent-time hypothesis assumes that older generations will represent an earlier form of the language and younger generations will represent a later form. Thus by comparing younger and older speakers, the direction of language change can be detected. The apparent-time method allows change to be studied by synchronic analysis (i.e., by examining the state of the language at a particular point in time); this contrasts with real-time sociolinguistics, which compares data from two points in time to observe change directly. Apparent-time analysis assumes that most features of language are acquired during childhood and remain relatively unchanged throughout an individual's lifetime once that individual is past a certain age. Therefore, a speaker's speech is a reflection of speech patterns acquired during language learning as a child. Overview=Methodology The apparent-time hypothesis depends on several assumptions: first, that a significantly broad sample is taken to be representative of the population; second, that vernacular speech is relatively stable in a given individual once that individual is past adolescence. Apparent-time studies are examples of cross-sectional studies, meaning a population group is examined at a certain point in time. Within the population, age-stratified variation is assumed to reflect the ages at which members of the population learned language. It is often contrasted with real- time studies, which are examples of longitudinal studies. The most direct way of investigating a population's usage of linguistic variants is through surveys and interviews. In the case of apparent-time studies, surveys are conducted in a population across a broad age range, in order to investigate the linguistic variants across a broad age spectrum. Theoretically, patterns of use should differ between different age groups. Data gathered from real- time sociolinguistics studies can also be used for apparent-time sociolinguistics. However, apparent-time data are only a surrogate for real- time evidence, and apparent-time data cannot uncritically be assumed to represent diachronic linguistic developments. Merits The apparent-time hypothesis allows sociolinguists the convenience of gathering data at one point in time or analyzing past data from historical linguistic studies that cannot be replicated. For real-time sociolinguistics, the same participants of the study must be recruited and tested at later times to validate the data, a difficult method to implement. However, real-time corpora can also be used for apparent-time analyses. Controversy=Criticisms The use of the apparent-time hypothesis in sociolinguistics is criticized for its insufficient informative value concerning an actual language change in progress. The results, if the study reflects a variation within different age groups, may be read as an ongoing language change or merely an expression of an age-graded variation within the tested network, which can have various reasons and does not necessarily indicate an actual language change. Comparison to real-time sociolinguistics Apparent-time sociolinguistics is often contrasted with real-time sociolinguistics. The apparent-time hypothesis is often assumed when it is not feasible to conduct real-time studies because of reasons such as time constraints and limited data. =Montreal English= Boberg compares apparent-time data on Montreal English with real-time data from earlier studies of the same community. A comparison was made between the 1972 survey by Scargill and Warkentyne and the more recent study in 1998-99 by Chambers. Real-time comparisons were made between the student group in 1972 to the 14–19 age group in 1999 and the parents from 1972 to the 40–49 age group in 1999. To make direct comparisons, data from 1999 were restricted to the real and project age categories of the 1972 study. The results reveal that while some age-correlated lexical variables show stability over speakers' lifetimes, which would suggest ongoing change, others show a change in progress over the speakers' lifetimes. However, the nature of individual change is generally found to be not the rejection of new variants by older speakers, associated with the age-grading model, but late adoption of new variants by adults who learned older variants as children. Case studies=Canadian (wh) study Canadian linguist J.K. Chambers, conducted a study applying the apparent-time hypothesis. The study, carried out in central Canada, examined the sociolinguistic variable (wh), where the unvoiced labiovelar glide /hw/ loses phonemic status and merges with the corresponding voiced glide /w/. In this study, the oldest subjects seem to indicate a stable period for this variable, both the 70- to 79-year-olds and those over 80 used the voiced variant where the unvoiced was \\"expected\\" 38.3 and 37.7% of the time, respectively. Each subsequent younger age cohort (10 years) shows a greater percentage of /w/ usage, with those 20–29 using /w/ 87.6% of the time and the teenagers using it 90.6% of the time. Notice that the deltas between the oldest two groups and between the youngest two groups are relatively small, 0.6% and 3.0%. Between these two extremes the rate of change between the groups is quite high, approximately 10% per age cohort. This pattern can be described as an initial stable period, followed by a period of rapid change, and a tailing off as the change nears completion. This S-curve pattern has been identified as characteristic for many types of linguistic changes. Maison study The apparent-time hypothesis has been applied in studies involving statistical analyses of semantic similarity judgements. J.P. Magué performed a study with native French speakers with mean ages of 21 years and 56 years. The study measured semantic variation among the speakers to create a semantic field by analyzing the speakers' judgements of synonyms for the French word maison 'house'. The synonyms had a high-frequency variation between the first and second halves of the 20th century. A correlation was found between semantic variation and age, in which the older group judged the synonyms more similar than the younger group. This shows that variation in semantic representations reflect semantic change instead of an age-grading phenomenon. This would be confirmed by real-time studies. The apparent time hypothesis has yet to be verified for semantic studies; however age-grading does not adequately explain why the semantic variation between ages occurs. Martha's Vineyard study Point of interest in the Martha's Vineyard study, conducted by William Labov in 1961, were the linguistic variables (ay) and (aw) in the speech of the islanders. The findings showed that the highest rate of centralization could be seen in the group of middle- age islanders from 31 to 45. Next highest rates were to be seen within the group of 46 to 60 years old. The age-stratified variation of the analyzed variables can be seen as an indicator of language change in progress, showing that the centralization of diphthongs on the island is about to decline in younger age groups. On the other hand, Labov discovered that young inhabitants, who left the island for work or study, showed an increase of centralizing diphthongs after they returned, which was explained by social factors. In fact, the study can rather be seen as a further point of intersection, where the apparent-time hypothesis comes across with the controversy of the hypothesis of age-graded variation, in which \\"individuals change their linguistic behavior throughout their lifetimes, but the community as a whole does not change.\\".

She was also the private secretary of Jean Moulin before being arrested then deported from 1943 to 1945 to the Nazi camp of Auschwitz, Ravensbrück and finally Buchenwald. Moreover, she is one of only six female resistants to be awarded the title Compagnon de la Libération. Life Diebold was born Laure Mutschler in Erstein (Alsace-Lorraine, part of the German Empire) to a French patriot family on 10 January 1915. She spent her childhood in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines where her parents lived from the year 1922. At the end of her studies, just before World War II, she became an administrative assistant in the \\"Etablissements Baumgartner\\". In 1940, Mutschler integrated the resistance network \\"A.V.\\" (which means \\"Army of the Volunteers\\" in French) of Dr. Bareiss in the annexed Alsace, and, at the same time, became a special agent under the name \\"Mado\\" in another resistance network known as \\"Mithidate\\". Her secret job led her to host in her home in Alsace escaped war prisoners before helping them to escape to France; but just before Christmas 1941, she had to leave Alsace secretly. She went to Lyon in the free south of France hidden in a locomotive. There, she worked as an administrative assistant in the service which works with refugees from Alsace; and from 1942, she collected information for her resistance network \\"Mithidate\\" before encoding them and sending them to London by post mail. On January 31, 1942, Mutschler was married to Eugène Diebold, who also escaped to Lyon. In July 1942 she was arrested with her husband, but they were released by the Gestapo. They moved to Aix-les-Bains where Mutschler became known only as \\"Mona\\". In September 1942 she was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant of the Free French Forces. She was assigned to the position of private secretary of Jean Moulin. After the arrest of Jean Moulin in 1943, she was sent to Paris to be the secretary of Georges Bidault. She was arrested again on 23 November 1943 with her husband and sent to Fresnes Prison. She was not tortured because she convinced her Nazi captors that she was just a secretary and not a major figure in the resistance network. Nevertheless, she was sent to the Nazi camp of Schirmeck and between January 1944 and her liberation in April 1945 she was transferred to Auschwitz, Ravensbrück and Buchenwald. Diebold died suddenly on 17 October 1965 in Lyon and, in accordance with her last wishes, she was buried in her childhood place Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines in Alsace. Today a street in Lyon and a square in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines are named in her honour.

Grand Valley Mine tipple for loading coal into gondolas of the Little Book Cliff Railway Carpenter is a ghost town in Mesa County, Colorado, United States, twelve miles northeast of Grand Junction at the end of an extension to 27¼ Road. The settlement was established by William Thomas Carpenter early in 1890 to provide the miners who worked in his two Book Cliff mines with a place to live. He began building shacks to house his single miners and later erected small houses for the employees with families. As a result of the town's rapid growth, a request to the U.S. post office to establish a branch there in June 1890 was quickly obliged and the community was officially dubbed Carpenter. However, the town never attained a population of over 50, and the post office closed after one year. After the closure of its post office, Carpenter built a company store and a combination boarding house/restaurant. Book Cliff company stone cutters and masons constructed several buildings and many foundations at Carpenter, using stone from the company quarry near the cliffs. One of the finest examples of a building made of Book Cliff sandstone is the Fruita, Colorado Catholic church. Several years of prosperity followed the arrival of the Little Book Cliff Railway at the townsite in 1892. Carpenter began to formulate big plans for his village. He envisioned it as a tourist resort complete with hotel, dance pavilion, picnic areas, and even a lake that was to be fed by a spring located near his Book Cliff mines. Carpenter renamed the camp Poland Spring after a noted resort of that name in Maine. It was variously referred to as Polen, Pollen, and Polan Springs, although Carpenter’s intended name was evidenced by his having it emblazoned on the side of one of his railroad excursion cars. The resort plans were never completed because Carpenter went broke shortly after the Panic of 1893. Isaac Chauncey Wyman, a wealthy Massachusetts investor, became the next owner of the Book Cliff company. The town continued to enjoy an active existence because he did much to improve the mines and thus created a need for additional employees. The old eating house, referred to as the Hotel de Carpenter on occasion, was converted into a school and church for the camp’s inhabitants, and many company structures were rebuilt and improved during Wyman’s tenure as owner. The new name Book Cliff was applied to the town but did not adhere any better than did Poland Springs. Usually, people referred to the place as the “Book Cliff Mines.” The town reached its zenith and then began a gradual decline following Wyman’s death in 1910. In his will, Wyman left the town, railroad, and mines to Princeton University. Princeton managed everything for 15 years then decided to abandon it all in 1925. By the end of that summer nearly everything had been sold, dismantled, and hauled away. References Lyndon J. Lampert and Robert W.

Gonzalo died of leukemia at Lausanne. He is buried in the Chapel of Saint Sebastian in the church of the Descalzas Reales in Madrid. Rank and titles Although noble, Gonzalo's mother was not of royal descent. Gonzalo's father signed a renunciation to the Spanish throne prior to the marriage, and thus Gonzalo and his brother were not in the line of succession to the Spanish throne in accordance with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1776. In Spain Gonzalo was generally addressed as Don Gonzalo de Borbón y Dampierre. Gonzalo was considered a French prince with the style His Royal Highness by those legitimists who believed that his grandfather Alfonso XIII was also the heir to the French throne. After his grandfather's death and the accession of his father Jaime in 1941, Gonzalo was regarded as second in line to the legitimist French throne for many years until the birth of his nephew in 1972. The internal family conflict over Gonzalo's rank and title continued throughout his life. In 1972 his uncle the Count of Barcelona invited him to the wedding of his daughter Margarita; the invitation did not recognise the royal rank of Gonzalo who wrote a letter of protest to his uncle.Aranguren, 222–223.

The Brigade drew its history from the 51st Guards Rifle Division, which was formed from the 76th Rifle Division midway through the Second World War. In late 1942, the 76th Rifle Division decimated the German force holding and protecting Kletskaya, a key industrial city with numerous metal works factories. For it, the division was promoted to Guards (Советская Гвардия) status on November 23, 1942, and became known as the 51st Guards Rifle Division. History=Action in World War IIStalingrad, Kursk, the Baltic: 1943–1945= In November 1942, the newly renamed Division was sent back to Stalingrad where it helped encircle and trap the attacking German 6th and 4th Panzer Armies during Operation Uranus. For its participation in the battle of Stalingrad, the unit was decorated with the Order of Lenin. In the summer of 1943, it was sent to complement tanks and other armored vehicles during the Battle of Kursk in Ukraine, once again retaking the cities of Belgorod and Bogodouqovye. From Kursk, the division was sent northward to push back German Army Groups Center and North. Under the command of General Ivan Bagramyan, the 1st Baltic Front commander, it liberated the Belorussian cities of Vitebsk and Polotski. Continuing its advance to the west, the 51st Guards Division took part in pushing Army Group North out of the former Soviet republics the Soviet Union had annexed in 1940, Latvia and Lithuania. Its sacrifice and courage in recapturing Vitebsk were recognized as it was bestowed with the honorary title of Vitebskyan in October 1944. One of the division's artillerymen Aramais Sarkisyan was killed in combat in Belorussia on June 25, 1944, and was recognized as a Hero of the Soviet Union, the highest honorary title for individuals in the Soviet Union. In the Latvian province of the Courland Peninsula was the final bastion of Army Group Courland. Despite repeated attempts to take the region, the German units resisted and successfully fended off Red Army offensives. In May 1945, the 51st Division was sent to Courland where it managed to isolate the forces remaining at the peninsula. On May 8, 1945, the remainder the garrison surrendered. The 51st division passed through approximately 7,000 kilometers of former Soviet territory and liberated over 600 towns and cities from the Axis occupying forces. Twenty-one men in the division were recognized as Heroes of the Soviet Union. The division's final wartime honorary title was '51 Guards Rifle Vitebsk Order of Lenin, Red Banner Division Armenian in the name of Voroshilov.'76 mining-Rifle Division Since World War IISoviet Union= The 51st Guards MRD (first formation) was formed after the Second World War from the 51st Guards Rifle Division but disbanded in the late 1950s in the Baltic Military District. Its honours and awards were taken over by the 29th Guards Rocket Division of the Strategic Rocket Forces.Michael Holm, 29th Guards Missile Division, accessed January 2013. In late 1947 the 15th Guards Rifle Division was relocated from the Austrian city of Vladimir- Volyn and Lyuboml. In the postwar years the unit's soldiers helped civilians rebuild postwar economy, harvest, were involved in the construction of irrigation systems in the Kuban and the Crimea. In September 1965, in an Order of the Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union commemorating the 51st Guards Rifle Division, which staunchly took the first blows of the German-Soviet war, the 15th Guards Rifle Division was given the number \\"51\\" and the honorary title of \\"Perekopskaya\\", becoming the 51st Guards Motor Rifle Division (second formation). It remained as part of the 13th Army (Soviet Union) in the Carpathian Military District since the late 1940s (when it was reassigned from the disbanding 5th Guards Army) until the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1988 the division comprised the 170th Tank Regiment, 44th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, 47th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, 50th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, 43rd Guards Artillery Regiment, and 59th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, plus smaller units.Feskov et al 2004, p.54 =Independent Ukraine= On January 19, 1992, personnel of the division took the oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the 1991 Declaration of Independence of Ukraine.

During August 2014, the brigade made three unsuccessful attempts to retake Ilovaisk. On 25 August, brigade soldier Andrei Krupa was captured by Russian troops and released a month later. In October 2014, President Petro Poroshenko ordered the disbandment of the brigade. Elements of the brigade judged to have performed well in combat became the new 14th Mechanized Brigade.

Division) was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866-1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. It was formed on October 1, 1912, and was the last regular division created in the Imperial German Army. It was headquartered in Saarburg in Lothringen (now Sarrebourg, France).Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p.135. The division was subordinated in peacetime to the XXI Army Corps (XXI. Armeekorps).Wegner, p. 86 The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was primarily recruited in the Rhine Province and the Province of Westphalia, as the German population in Alsace-Lorraine was insufficient to fill the division. Combat chronicle The division began World War I on the Western Front, fighting in the Battle of the Frontiers and then in the Race to the Sea. It was then transferred to the Eastern Front, seeing action in 1915 in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive and Operation Albion. It remained on the Eastern Front until December 1917, when it returned to France. In 1918, it fought in the Battle of the Lys and faced various Allied offensives, including the Hundred Days Offensive. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.42\\\\.

T. Petty. The film is based on an original short film, Blood Red Earth directed by Petty.The Burrowers World Premiere Exclusively Free on Fearnet.com Plot The year is 1879, and beyond the fringes of civilization a handful of pioneers maintain settlements while exploring the unknown territories. One night, a family from one of these settlements is brutally dragged into darkness by a group of unknown invaders. At first the kidnappers are thought to be hostile Native Americans, and a posse forms to bring the family back home safely. Venturing out into the unmapped territories is an Irish immigrant desperate to find his lost love, a naïve teen eager to prove his worth, a former slave seeking his fortune, and a hardened pair of battle-weary Indian fighters. But nature's wrath and the tomahawks of hostile tribes are not the only threats that this group will be forced to confront, because as the bodies begin to multiply and the truth about the abductors gradually emerges, these rescuers will find out that there are forces in this world that cannot be described in human terms—and that seem to have motivations beyond our comprehension. A species, called \\"Burrowers\\" by the Natives, used to subsist on buffalo. When white settlers depleted the buffalo, the species began to survive on human meat - first hunting nearby Indians and later the settlers. One tribe in particular, the Ute, have experience in combating the hunter-species. The \\"Burrowers\\" first lace their victims by cutting them and drugging them with a toxin. The victim is then buried alive and eaten only after decomposition has begun. By the time the film's protagonists meet up with the Ute their numbers are severely depleted, but the Ute method of drugging someone already infected with \\"Burrower\\" toxin proves effective. When the \\"Burrowers\\" go to eat the twice drugged victim they themselves fall asleep and are vulnerable, especially to the rays of the sun, which are the only apparent thing that can kill them. However, the surviving member of the posse, the Irishman Coffey, is unable to discover exactly what the Ute used to drug the \\"Burrowers\\", as most of the remaining Ute are executed by the overzealous cavalry. The film ends with the suggestion that the \\"Burrower\\" attacks will continue. CastRelease The Burrowers was first screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2008. Home media The film was released on DVD by Lionsgate and Maple Pictures in the United States and Canada respectively on April 21, 2009. Critical response The Burrowers received mostly positive reviews upon its release, with critics praising the film's blending of horror and western genres, cinematography, and character development. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75%, based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 6.02/10. Karina Longworth of IndieWire praised the cinematography, and screenplay, noting that the film \\"plays less like a horror film than a Terrence Malick film, with a mythological MacGuffin designed to reveal dark truths about the men forced to deal with it.\\" Adrian Halen from HorrorNews.net offered the film similar praise, while noting that the film was more focused on its characters rather than its title antagonists.

The melody is said to be a contrafactum of a popular border rant, \\"Bonnie Annie.\\" A different version, the one that endurs today, was musically adapted in 1869 by William Metcalfe (1829–1909), the organist and choirmaster of Carlisle Cathedral. The tune etymology has a long history that has been traced back to 1695 and attributed to adaptations – one in particular, from the 20th century, the 1939 jingle, \\"Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot.\\"  History  John Graves, who wrote it in Cumbrian dialect, tinkered with the words over the years and several versions are known. George Coward, a Carlisle bookseller who wrote under the pseudonym Sidney Gilpin, rewrote the lyrics with Graves' approval, translating them from their original broad Cumberland dialect to Anglican; and in 1866, he published them in the book, Songs and Ballads of Cumberland. Another song written by Graves mentions one of John's brothers, Askew Peel (1789–1854), a horsedealer who also lived in Caldbeck. \\"D'ye ken John Peel?\\" was first sung in 1824 in Gate House in Caldbeck in John Graves’ home to the tune of the Border rant \\"Bonnie Annie.\\" A different musical version was composed in 1869 by William Metcalfe, a conductor and composer – and lay clerk of Carlisle Cathedral. His arrangement – lauded as more musical than the traditional melody – became popular in London and was widely published. In 1906, the song was published in The National Song Book, but with a tune closer to Bonnie Annie – and _that_ version is the most widely known today. English counties have no official anthem. However, \\"D'ye ken John Peel?\\" is commonly regarded as a kind of unofficial anthem of Cumberland and the region.  Etymology and other uses  British musicologist Ann Gilchrist (1863–1954) and Canadian folklorist Edith Fowke (1913–1996) trace the use of the tune and lyrics in other songs and poems, including: 1. \\"Red House,\\" first published in 1695 by John Playford (1623–1686/7) in The Dancing Master (9th ed.) : Aka: 1. \\"Where will Our Good Man Lay? 2. \\"Where/Whar Wad Our Gudman/Bonny Annie Lye/Laye\\" 3. \\"Where/Whar wad our Guidman Lie\\" : \\"Where Will Our Goodman Laye,\\" published in Oswald's Caledonian Pocket Companion for the Flute (Vol. 2) (c. 1750), published by James Oswald (1710–1769) 4. From the 1729 opera, Polly, Act I, Scene VIII, Air 9, the song \\"Red House,\\" being the same version published in The Dancing Master 2. \\"Address to the Woodlark,\\" by Robert Burns (1759–1796) 3. \\"0! What Can Make My Annie Sigh?\\" by John Anderson 4. The words, \\"Where wad bonny Anne lye?,\\" in the song, \\"The Cordial,\\" sung to the tune \\"Where Should Our Goodman Ly?\\" : Published January 1, 1724, in Allan Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany: Or A Collection of Choice Songs, Scots and English (11th ed.) (Vol. 1 of 4) 5. English-turned-American composer Austen Herbert Croom-Johnson (1909–1964), born in Hereford, imported the tune, \\"D'ye ken John Peel,\\" and scored it for a 1939 jingle, \\"Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot\\" (aka \\"Nickel, Nickel\\"). His Chicago-born lyricist partner, Alan Bradley Kent (né Karl Dewitt Byington, Jr.; 1912–1991), wrote the words. :: :: goodman = husband :: guidman = form of address, typically between people of equal rank who are not on familiar terms (also gudman, gudeman, goodman, and more) :: bonnie = pretty, attractive :: air = aria or song :: ken = to be aware of or to know  Lyrics  Verse 1 (best known; by Graves) D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay?‡ D'ye ken John Peel at the break o' day? D'ye ken John Peel when he's far, far a-way. With his hounds and his horn in the morning? Chorus : For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed, : And the cry of his hounds which he oft time led, : Peel's \\"View, Halloo!\\" could awaken the dead, : Or the fox from his lair in the morning. ‡Some versions, according to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, show the phrase as \\" with his coat so gray,\\" inferring that his coat was likely made of local Herdwick wool, commonly gray. If so, the color of John Peel's coat would be in contrast to that of other huntsmen – traditionally brightly colored, often red or hunting pink. Additional verses Verse 2 (Coward's version) D'ye ken that bitch whose tongue was death? D'ye ken her sons of peerless faith? D'ye ken that fox, with his last breath Curs’d them all as he died in the morning? : For the sound of his horn, etc. Verse 3 Yes I ken John Peel and Ruby too Ranter and Royal and Bellman as true,* From the drag to the chase, from the chase to the view From a view to the death in the morning :For the sound of his horn, etc. Verse 4 And I've followed John Peel both often and far, O'er the rasper fence and the gate and the bar, From low Denton Holme up to Scratchmere Scar, Where we vie for the brush in the morning : For the sound of his horn, etc. Verse 5 Then here's to John Peel with my heart and soul Come fill – fill to him another strong bowl, And we'll follow John Peel through fair and through foul While we’re waked by his horn in the morning. : For the sound of his horn, etc. *These were the real names of the hounds that Peel, in his old age, said were the very best he ever had or saw. – J.W.G. Alternative versions As is common with songs often sung from memory, this has been recorded with other verses and minor differences in lyrics, such as in the third verse: \\"From the drag to the chase, from the chase to the view\\" and \\"From a view to a death in the morning\\": Alternative verse 1 Yes, I ken John Peel and his Ruby, too! Ranter and Ringwood, Bellman so true! From a find to a check, from a check to a view, From a view to a kill in the morning. : For the sound of his hor', etc. Coward's version of the last line was used for Matt Cartmill's book, A View to a Death in the Morning: Hunting and Nature Through History. The alternative version was used as a title to the short story From a View to A Kill, found in the Ian Fleming collection of short stories, For Your Eyes Only. This was in turn shortened to A View to a Kill, when applied to the fourteenth James Bond movie. This verse was not in Coward's version: Alternative verse 2 D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay? He liv'd at Troutbeck once on a day; Now he has gone far, away; We shall ne'er hear his voice in the morning. : For the sound of his horn, etc.  Parodies  A number of parodies also exist. On BBC radio's I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, a version parodied the British Radio DJ John Peel 1st parody D'ye ken John Peel with his voice so grey? He sounds as if he's far far away; He sends you to sleep at the end of the day; 'til you're woken up by Tony Blackburn in the morning. Another was used in the 1979 film Porridge, which saw Ronnie Barker as Fletch cheekily observe a new prison warden. 2nd parody D'ye see yon screw with his look so vain? With his brand new key on his brand new chain; With a face like a ferret and a pea for a brain : And his hand on his whistle in the morning.  Regimental marches  * \\"John Peel\\" was one of the quick marches of the King's Own Royal Border Regiment before it merged in 2004 with the Queen's Lancashire Regiment and the King's Regiment to become the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. * \\"John Peel\\" is the authorized Regimental March (dismounted) of The Lorne Scots (Peel, Dufferin and Halton Regiment) and The Ontario Regiment (RCAC) of the Canadian Forces. * \\"John Peel\\" is the regimental march of the Queen's Own Yeomanry, an armoured formation reconnaissance regiment of the British Army.

Early life and education Tamblyn was born in 1951 in Waukegan, Illinois, and attended a Catholic girls' school in Mundelein, Carmel High School for Girls. She was very shy as a child and never learned to ride a bike or drive a car. She moved to Chicago in 1968 or 1969 and began to audit courses at the University of Chicago while working as an administrative assistant for an insurance company. Around 1973 she began undergraduate studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she focused on video and performance because of what she saw as their links to everyday life. Her aesthetic in this period was deeply influenced by the work of Allan Kaprow and the Happenings of the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as by the Chicago Imagist school of videomakers, which included her teacher Phil Morton. She taught graduate-level courses in video while still an undergraduate.Guide to the Christine Tamblyn Papers, Online Archive of California On graduating from SAIC in 1979, Tamblyn moved to New York and pursued her performance work in East Village spaces. This was a difficult time in her life as she lacked access to the advanced equipment she needed to produce her work. She taught for a while at the School of Visual Arts and held some clerical jobs. By the early 1980s, Tamblyn had become increasingly involved in curatorial work. She decided to go to graduate school at the University of California, San Diego, where she was able to study with Kaprow as well as with the conceptual and performance artists Eleanor Antin and David Antin. She received her M.F.A. degree in 1986. In 1994, Tamblyn was hired as an assistant professor at Florida International University, Miami. Two years later, she took up an assistant professorship in the Department of Studio Art at the University of California, Irvine, where she began to lay the foundation of the department's digital arts curriculum. A few months before her death, Tamblyn moved back to San Francisco. She died there of breast cancer on New Year's Day 1998. Her archive is held by the University of California, Irvine. Art career and teaching As a visual artist, Tamblyn worked in performance and new media and was in the forefront of those experimenting with video and computer technologies for the creation of conceptual art.Harrison, Dew. \\"Exploring Duchampian and Darwinian ideas through interactive means.\\" Proceedings for EVA2009, Computer Art Society. British Computer Society, London (2010). Indeed, along with artists such as Timothy Binkley, Tamblyn argued that the emergence of computer art represented the apogee of the 20th century's conceptual art movement.Saltz, David Z. \\"The Art of Interaction: Interactivity, Performativity, and Computers.\\" Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 55 (1997): 117-128. Many of Tamblyn's works were autobiographically inflected, including the CD-ROM projects She Loves It, She Loves It Not: Women and Technology (1993), Mistaken Identities (1995)—both of which have been shown widely—and the posthumous Archival Quality (1998).Czegledy, Nina. \\"Gardens of Forking Paths: A Journey into the CD-ROMs of Christine Tamblyn and Adriene Jenik\\", n.paradoxa 2 (July 1998): pp.80-81. By including personal materials such as childhood journals, Tamblyn underlined the fact that interactive media do not provide a space of absolute freedom for the viewer but instead offer a structure that complexly links viewer to artist.Milutis, Joe. \\"Riddles of the Interface: Hieroglyphic Consciousness and New Experimental Multimedia.\\" Wide Angle 21.1 (1999): 95-103. Tamblyn's work was exhibited during her lifetime at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (London), Pacific Film Archives (California), San Francisco Exploratorium, Wexner Center for Contemporary Art (Ohio); Walter Phillips Gallery in the Banff Centre (Canada), and numerous other international venues. Tamblyn liked to work with other artists, and She Loves It, She Loves It Not was a collaboration with two of her SFSU students, Marjorie Franklin and Paul Tompkins. An interactive multimedia essay that channels contradictory attitudes towards technology in art, it was both an alternative kind of artist's book and one of the first CD- ROMs created and produced by a woman artist.Morse, Margaret. \\"The Poetics of Interactivity.\\" Women, Art, and Technology, 2003, p. 16. Tamblyn's second CD- ROM, Mistaken Identities, which set up comparisons between the life stories of ten prominent women, won a number of awards, including Finalist Award at the 1996 New York Exposition of Short Film and Video, an Honorable Mention in the 1996 \\"New Voices, New Visions\\" contest sponsored by Wired magazine, and First Prize in the 1997 International Festival of the Image in Colombia. In 1997 Tamblyn was commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts to produce a new CD-ROM, Archival Quality. This catalogue of her own writing and experience was nearly complete when she died and was finished by friends and colleagues.Trend, David. \\"Christine Tamblyn, Studio Art: Irvine\\", Calisphere website, 1998. In the 1980s, Tamblyn began working with feminist performance artists. In 1984 she was invited by the Los Angeles Woman's Building to create As the Worm Turns, a work that challenged the anti-pornography position held by some feminists. Some of her later writing similarly upholds the ways that sexually explicit imagery can serve as an antidote to certain idealized and prescriptive versions of female sexuality.Frueh, Joanna, and Arlene Raven. \\"Feminist Art Criticism: Its Demise and Resurrection.\\" Art Journal (1991): 6-10. In 1984 Tamblyn moved to San Francisco and began teaching at San Francisco State University as lecturer and coordinator of their graduate program, a position she held until 1996. Over the next few years, she also taught for short periods at the San Francisco Art Institute (1988-1990), University of California, Santa Cruz (1989), Mills College (1990), and the University of California, Berkeley (1990-1993), where she was a visiting assistant professor. While living in the Bay Area, she wrote for several major art publications, including Artweek (as contributing editor), Cinematograph (as editor), and Art News (as correspondent). By this point she had been writing art criticism and exhibition catalogs for most of a decade and had already served as the video and performance editor for the New Art Examiner journal from 1977 to 1979. Tamblyn was a prolific critic, going on to write dozens of reviews and a number of essays for Afterimage, High Performance, and Leonardo in addition to the above publications. Her writing often addressed issues of gender exclusion in new media, censorship of artists, and declining arts funding. She was known for producing finished articles from a first draft, without the need for revisions, an ability she attributed to her lifelong habit of daily journal writing. Twice, in 1987 and 1990, her writing was recognized by the John McCarron Art Writing Award from Artspace in San Francisco.

The mall's anchor stores are Dave & Buster's, HomeGoods, Round 1 Entertainment (opening 2021), JCPenney, Louie's Tux Shop, Macy's, and Barnes & Noble. History Since the mall's opening in 1966, Glenbrook has been expanded and/or renovated five times. These expansions and renovations occurred in 1976, 1981, 1990, 1994, and 1998; with the 1976, 1981, and 1998 renovations also being major expansions. Glenbrook Square annually receives over 15 million visitors,Glenbrook Square Mall Info . Retrieved 2008-04-20. and is the only enclosed super-regional mall in northeast Indiana. Based on leasable square feet, Glenbrook Square is also one of the three largest malls in the state of Indiana along with Castleton Square in Indianapolis and Southlake Mall in Merrillville. In total, Glenbrook Square has a gross leasable area of . Glenbrook Square features spaces for five anchors, currently occupied by Barnes & Noble, JCPenney, and Macy's, with one currently unused space under redevelopment and a second lot under redevelopment. L.S. Ayres (now Macy's) is Glenbrook Square's original anchor, in continuous operation since the mall's opening. Sears also opened simultaneously with the mall; this store closed in 2018. An A&P; grocery store was also an original tenant. This store closed when A&P; left Fort Wayne in the 1970s, and Barnes & Noble now occupies this area. The building for JCPenney was added in the 1976 expansion, another building (now unused) was added in the 1981 expansion, and the Barnes & Noble store was converted in 2007 from several smaller stores. In addition to three anchors, Glenbrook Square contains 152 stores and kiosks. A food court can be found, along with casual dining restaurants P.F. Chang's, Red Robin, Granite City Food & Brewery, TGI Fridays, and BJ's Brewhouse. Hudson's, and later Marshall Field's, once operated a store in the 1981 anchor space. In 2004 Marshall Field's was bought by May Co., which also owned the L.S. Ayres anchor. They closed the Marshall Field's anchor in 2005, and on December 12, 2007 the company (which by then had merged with Federated Department Stores and been renamed Macy's, Inc.) sold the vacant store back to GGP for $1 million. Between GGP's acquisition of the space from Macy's and the search for a new anchor, the former Marshall Field's space was used in several ways. These included temporary retailers such as Glowgolf, a fashion show sponsored by local Christian radio station WLAB Star 88.3,http://star883.com/news/post/modest-is-hottest and a Habitat for Humanity gift-wrapping station and display of Department 56 houses that operated during several holiday seasons. On December 12, 2012, GGP announced that Carson's would anchor the long-vacant space starting in the fall of 2013.http://www.wane.com/dpp/news/business/carsons-to-move-into-former- marshall-fields-space Carson's began construction in January 2013 and opened to the public on September 10 at 9:00AM of that year after over $1.6 million in renovations to the space. The holiday Habitat for Humanity display continued for one more season at a new location in the mall in the Carson's wing. A water main break occurred at Glenbrook Square on October 31, 2013 during overnight hours.http://www.wane.com/news/local/water-main-break-causes- damage-at-glenbrook-square 50 stores were damaged in the incident, but all five anchor stores were unaffected. Most affected stores were repaired and reopened within weeks, and all damaged stores except one reopened by Black Friday 2013.http://www.glenbrooksquare.com/events/water-main-break In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Glenbrook Square, into Seritage Growth Properties.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/4201-coldwater- rd/3312532/landing In April 2018, it was announced that the Carson's store would be closing due their parent company, The Bon-Ton Stores, going out of business. The store was closed on August 31, 2018. On August 22, 2018, Sears announced that the store would also be closing as part of a plan to close 46 stores nationwide. The store was scheduled to close in November 2018 after 52 years in business.https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/sears-at-glenbrook- mall-to-close-in-november/1389169521 At the same time as the store closings, Brookfield and Seritage Growth Properties put plans in place to renovate the former Carson's and Sears spaces, respectively. On February 6, 2019, it was announced that the shuttered Sears at Glenbrook Square Mall will be torn down under a plan to erect a new retail building in its place and a free-standing Portillo's eatery nearby. The Allen County Plan Commission received an application from New York-based Seritage SRC Finance LLC to develop the Shoppes at Glenbrook where Sears operated for five decades. The plan called for the Sears store and auto shop to be demolished, and a new retail building to be built, attached to the Glenbrook Square building. Announced tenants for this new wing include Dave & Buster's, HomeGoods, and Portillo's. Additional tenants will be announced later. Demolition of the former Sears was completed in summer 2019 and the new tenants will open in 2020. On August 8, 2019, Japanese firm Round One Entertainment announced that they would be opening in the former Carson's in 2021 as part of a larger expansion plan in the United States. Round1 will feature bowling, karaoke, arcade games, and food. Despite similar products, Round1 is a family-oriented concept whereas Dave & Buster's is focused on adults.

It is native to western North America. In 2005, D. pseudoobscura was the second Drosophila species to have its genome sequenced, after the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Allopatric speciation has been induced by reproductive isolation in D. pseudoobscura after only eight generations using different food types, starch and maltose.  Polyandry  Female Drosophila pseudoobscura are polyandrous, meaning they mate with more than one male. By mating with multiple males, polyandrous females have more genetically diverse offspring.  Fitness benefits  Prevention of extinction = In the D. pseudoobscura population, some males have a harmful chromosome called sex ratio (SR), where an inactive Y-chromosome is transmitted. If an SR male mates with a female, the female will produce only daughters. Monandry allows the spread of SR and increases the extinction risk in species having SR genes because the SR driver can spread quickly, enriching populations for females. Polyandry decreases the SR gene frequency because the non-SR male sperm outcompete the SR male sperm. Therefore, polyandry results in a decreased risk of extinction in the population. = Increased net offspring survival = Monandrous female D. pseudoobscura do not obtain sufficient sperm or a plenty of suitable sperm for the fertilization. Even though monandrous female experiencing multiple copulations can produce more eggs than polyandrous female experiencing multiple copulations, monandrous females produce less offspring that survive into adulthood than polyandrous females do. This means that polyandrous females have higher egg-to-adult survival ratio than monandrous females, making the polyandrous females more fit. = Mate selection as a fitness benefit = Polyandrous relationships benefit females D. pseudoobscura. In males D. pseudoobscura, the variation in number of sperms shows the difference in benefits between polyandrous and monandrous females. Males D. pseudoobscura ejaculate more sperm than any other Drosophila species, and it provides important nourishing factors to females and their offspring. The offspring viability benefits are increased by multiple and variable sperms through ejaculates. There are no additional costs to polyandrous females, because there are not big differences in life expectancy between monandrous female experiencing multiple copulations and polyandrous female experiencing multiple copulations.  Evolutionary consequences  Polyandry, in general, may have a few fitness consequences. Densely populated areas may have lower rates of polyandry due to environmental restraints such as geographic location and limited resources. This can greatly limit the survival and reproduction of offspring. Therefore, in population dense areas, polyandrous behavior may actually be a fitness consequence since the environment significantly controls the number of offspring that survive. Polyandry could also pose genetic fitness consequences. Polyandry does not always result in the spread of the most adaptive genes. For example, some individuals may appear to be attractive due to genes that code for increased pheromone production. As a result, attractive individuals are more likely to reproduce more often. However, since these individuals do not always contain adaptive genes, multiple mating events do not always result in the propagation of adaptive genes.

During Nixon's presidential campaign of 1968, the candidate made use of the contrasting style of two speechwriters (the other being Pat Buchanan) with Price becoming known to colleagues as Mr Outside because his work was aimed at broadening Nixon's appeal. A native of New York City, Price graduated from Yale University in 1951. There, he was a member of the Conservative Party of the Yale Political Union and also belonged to Skull and Bones. Price wrote a retrospective on the presidency titled With NixonNew York : Viking Press, 1977. and assisted Nixon in the writing of several books.

He was a 6'8\\" (203 cm) 225 lb (102 kg) power forward who occasionally also played the center position. Thomson was a member of the Joventut Badalona team that reached a EuroLeague final in 1992, and lifted the trophy in 1994. Early life Corny started playing basketball because people suggested that he play because he was tall. He was about 6'5\\" before he got to High School.http://www.uconnhooplegends.com/menslegends/ThompsonCorny.html He wasn't serious about it until Middle School. From then on, every year, Corny progressed, went to camp and became a better player. High school Corny attended Middletown High School in Middletown, Connecticut. In his freshman season, Corny was too good for the freshman team so he was promoted up to the Varsity team. The Varsity coach was Tom Labella. The team lost 5 or 6 games that year. In his sophomore through senior seasons the team won 76 games in a row. That record has still not been broken. The team won three State Championships and was ranked in the top 25 basketball teams in the country. Corny was the captain in the 1976, 1977, 1978 seasons (sophomore-senior). Corny still holds many records at Middletown High School. College career North Carolina, Virginia, Princeton and UConn were the schools Corny narrowed his decision down to.http://www.uconnhooplegends.com/menslegends/ThompsonCorny.html Corny liked the idea of staying close to home and he thought there would be advantages to being close to home. At Connecticut he was coached by Dom Perno. In his freshman season Corny started in every game, and the Huskies made the NCAA Tournament. Corny led the team in scoring all four years at UConn and finished with 1,810 points, and 1,017 rebounds.http://www.uconnhuskies.com/datadump/MBasketball/2009/Media_Guide/UConn_103-118.pdf Corny graduated in 1982 with a degree in Business Professional career Thompson was the 4th pick in the third round (50th overall) of the 1982 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks and played 44 games with them in the 1982–83 season, averaging 2.8 points, 2.7 rebounds and 0.8 assists per game. During the summer prior to his second year with the Mavericks, he suffered a knee injury, after which he was released from the team. Corny worked hard to get healthy and played basketball in Italy for Pallacanestro Varese in the Italian league for six years. It is when he played in the Spanish ACB League for a great Joventut Badalona team between 1990 and 1994 that he reached his full potential though, making it to the FIBA European League final in 1992 and winning the title in 1994.Tompson scoring the winning 3 point shot at the 1994 FIBA European League Final Four against Olympiacos.onsports.gr ΤΕΛ ΑΒΙΒ, 19 και 21 ΑΠΡΙΛΙΟΥ 1994: Ο Κορνέλιους, οι βολές και οι... βάρβαροι ReferencesExternal links * NBA stats @ basketballreference.com * Fibaeurope.com profile Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:American expatriate basketball people in Spain Category:American men's basketball players Category:Baloncesto León players Category:Basketball coaches from Connecticut Category:Basketball players from Connecticut Category:Continental Basketball Association coaches Category:Dallas Mavericks draft picks Category:Dallas Mavericks players Category:Detroit Spirits players Category:Joventut Badalona players Category:Liga ACB players Category:McDonald's High School All-Americans Category:Pallacanestro Varese players Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:UConn Huskies men's basketball players ","title":"Corny Thompson"},{"id":"12759853","text":"Giuseppe Lignano is an Italian-born architect and co-founder (with Ada Tolla) of the architectural design studio LOT-EK.

This field of study includes research and monitoring assessments of biophysical changes, analyses to identify causal and influential factors or support carrying capacity planning and management, and investigations of the efficacy of educational, regulatory, and site management actions designed to minimize recreation impacts. While studies of human trampling can be traced back to the late 1920s, a substantial body of recreation ecology literature did not accumulate until the 1970s when visitation to the outdoors soared, threatening the ecology of natural and semi-natural areas. Research Resource elements examined include soil, vegetation, water, and more recently, wildlife and microbes, with the majority of investigations conducted on trails, recreation sites, and campsites. Use-impact relationships, environmental resistance and resilience, management effectiveness, monitoring techniques, and carrying capacity are some of the major themes in recreation ecology. Study results have been applied to inform site and visitor management decisions and to provide scientific inputo to management planning frameworks such as: * Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) * Visitor Experience and Resource Protection (VERP) Ecotourism Recent growth of ecotourism has prompted a new batch of recreation ecology studies focusing on developing countries where ecotourism is aggressively promoted. There is an increasing concern that ecotourism is not inherently sustainable and, if unchecked, would generate substantial impacts to ecotourism destinations which are often fragile ecosystems.

These changes in the mucosa include friability of the mucosa and the presence of ectatic blood vessels at the surface. Patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy may experience bleeding from the stomach, which may uncommonly manifest itself in vomiting blood or melena; however, portal hypertension may cause several other more common sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such as esophageal varices and gastric varices. On endoscopic evaluation of the stomach, this condition shows a characteristic mosaic or \\"snake-skin\\" appearance to the mucosa of the stomach. Signs and symptoms Most patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy have either a stable or improving course in the appearance of the gastropathy on endoscopy. However, according to retrospective data, roughly one in seven patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy will develop bleeding (either acute or chronic) attributable to the gastropathy. Patients with chronic bleeding will usually come to the attention of the medical system because of anemia. The diagnosis of portal hypertensive gastropathy is usually made on endoscopy. The usual appearance of portal hypertensive gastropathy on endoscopy is a mosaic- like or reticular pattern in the mucosa. Red spots may or may not be present. The pattern is usually seen throughout the stomach. A similar pattern can be seen with a related condition called gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), or watermelon stomach. However, in GAVE, the ectatic blood vessels are more commonly found in the antrum or lower part of the stomach. Pathogenesis Several studies have found that patients with portal hypertension develop increased blood flow to the stomach. The physiological findings that correlate with worsening portal hypertensive gastropathy include an increased portal venous pressure gradient and decreased hepatic blood flow. Biopsies of the stomach in patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy show ectatic (or dilated) blood vessels, evidence of bleeding by means of red blood cells in the lamina propria, and edema in the stomach wall. Treatment Argon plasma coagulation, seen here to treat gastric antral vascular ectasia, has also been used to treat bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy Medications Several treatment options have been developed for portal hypertensive gastropathy. The first is the use of beta-blockers, which reduce portal pressures. Non-selective beta blockers (such as propranolol and nadolol) have been used to decrease the pressure of the portal vein in patients with esophageal varices, and have been shown to regress portal hypertensive gastropathy that has been worsened by medical treatment of varices. Propranolol has also been evaluated in patients with chronic cirrhosis and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Other medications that primarily treat bleeding, including anti-fibrinolytic medications such as tranexamic acid have also been used in case reports of patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy. These medications work by stabilizing deposits of fibrin at sites that ordinarily would bleed. Finally, octreotide, an analogue of somatostatin that leads to vasoconstriction of the portal circulation, can be used for active bleeding due to portal hypertensive gastropathy. Sucralfate, a coating medication has also been used, but evidence is from animal models. Procedural Portal hypertensive gastropathy can also be treated with endoscopic treatment delivered through a fibre-optic camera into the stomach. Argon plasma coagulation and electrocautery have both been used to stop bleeding from ectatic vessels, and to attempt to obliterate the vessels, but have limited utility if the disease is diffuse. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedures, or TIPS involve decompressing the portal vein by shunting a portal venule to a lower pressure systemic venule, under guidance with fluoroscopy. Since it treats the root cause of portal hypertension gastropathy, it has been putatively used for the condition. The literature reports suggest both regression of portal hypertensive gastropathy on endoscopic images and improvement in bleeding after TIPS. Finally, cryotherapy involves the use of pressurized carbon dioxide administered through the endoscope to freeze and destroy tissue in a focal area. It is being studied for the treatment of portal hypertensive gastropathy. Similar conditions Congestion of the mucosa in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract can also be seen in portal hypertension. When the condition involves the colon, it is termed portal hypertensive colopathy.

Biography Edwards was born in Newcastle, New South Wales in 1933, she studied in Sydney, the Brera Academy of Art in Milan, and at the Morley College Art School in London, before moving to New York in 1974. In New York, Edwards arrived at her signature style of abstract painting and collage, influenced by Abstract Expressionism, the dominant movement in American painting in the late 1940s and 1950s. At the core of Abstract Expressionism was a belief in the spontaneous freedom of the individual artist and the expression of the inner world of the artist's psychology and spirituality. Such art referred only distantly or obliquely, if at all, to the outside world. As a style, Abstract Expressionism also ranged over two very different sensibilities, both reflected in Edwards' work. One was characterized by energetic brushwork and rhythmic, dynamic compositions, as seen in the works of Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell and Antoni Tàpies. The other was more contemplative in mood and made up of subtle color harmonies, often sombre, with relatively static compositions and simple forms, exemplified by the paintings of Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt. Edwards preferred people to interpret her art in their own way, which is why she titled her work with the initials 'NY' (for work done in New York) and with a number, rather than a more descriptive title. She first exhibited a series of black paintings in New York in 1978. In hand written notes on her work in 1983, Edwards explained that, for her, black \\"is essential for directing the viewer...into a spiritual dimension, acknowledging the hidden mysterious nature of the eternal\\". Edwards noted that a black surface attuned the viewer to strive to glimpse subtleties of forms, some of which gave an illusion of depth (with some planes receding and others approaching the viewer), an illusion which could be related psychologically to the experience of varying levels of human consciousness: \\"If the painter achieves sufficient depth in the process of painting an experience of passing through an open door into a feeling of oneness or unity or complete freedom is attained\\". Then, in Edwards' work of the early 1980s, strong verticals and horizontals appeared across textured canvases. The physical presence of these dynamic works is compelling in itself, but there are also forms reminiscent of both natural and urban environments:linear elements may refer to tree trunks, horizons, rocks, rivers, cliffs, shorelines. And it has been noted that the gritty, rusted- industrial or bituminous looking surfaces of the paintings echo Edward's experiences of twice renovating filthy, former commercial loft spaces in the SoHo and TriBeCa areas of New York. In 1985, Edwards' black paint began to merge into deep colors: ochres, earthy reds and deep blues. These paintings, writes curator Jeanne Wilkinson, \\"portrayed darkness as a universal constant; not empty but filled with some mysterious presence; an origin, not a lack of light\\". Works on paper were also important in Edwards' art. She was constantly creating collages, prints and visual diaries, which are a record of ideas, an echo of experiences and environments as in the paintings, and sometimes a lighter and humorous foil to the darker, more intense paintings. When she died in 1989, Edwards had created a series of images that trace a journey both earthbound and spiritual; in her own words: \\"a progression through darkness and light\\". (Sue Smith - Curator Rockhampton Art Gallery 2007) Works by Edwards are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Canada, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

Some references are based on themes central to the story, such as the use of Nadsat words or phrases, whilst others have incorporated visual elements from the film. The film made Kubrick one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, and the film has become a cult classic. Fashion *The film version influenced bands' fashion styles. Films *The film version of A Clockwork Orange immediately revolutionized the science fiction film genre, opening the way for other films to portray elaborate dystopian narratives and to intelligently analyze social dilemmas. Many film directors have borrowed themes and cinematic techniques from the film. The film is an essential part of modern cinema and films often reference it,Russel, Catherine, 1995, Narrative Mortality: Death, Closure, and New Wave Cinemas, University of Minnesota Press, . with examples of films using similar cinematic techniques to A Clockwork Orange including THX 1138 (1971), Westworld (1973) and A Boy and His Dog (1975). The June 2006 issue of Entertainment Weekly named A Clockwork Orange the second most controversial film of all time, after The Passion of the Christ. *The torture scene in Reservoir Dogs (1992), set to \\"Stuck in the Middle With You\\", was described by Quentin Tarantino in an interview as a direct reference to the scene in A Clockwork Orange where Alex kicks the writer and rapes his wife to the tune of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\". A Clockwork Orange is also referenced at the beginning of the film when all the men are walking in slow motion, as Alex and his droogs did.Richards, Jeffrey, 1997, Films and British National Identity: From Dickens to Dad's Army, Manchester University, . *In Trainspotting (1996), director Danny Boyle referenced the bar Alex and his droogs sit in during the opening scene, where a club has similar text-based wall art. *In Gangster No. 1, a 2000 British crime film, Malcolm McDowell, who played Alex in the film, plays the protagonist gangster as a sort of older version of Alex.Nelmes, Jill, 2003, An Introduction to Film Studies, Routledge, . *The protagonist in Good Bye, Lenin! (2003) is named Alex, and the film features a furniture-shifting scene set to a sped-up synthesized version of the \\"William Tell Overture\\". *In Richard E. Grant's film Wah-Wah (2005), the main character, Grant himself as a child, takes comfort in watching a late-night screening of the film. *In the film Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (2006), Jack Black, while trying to sleep on a park bench, is assaulted by a gang dressed as the droogs. *Heath Ledger said he was inspired by Alex DeLarge to play the Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). While preparing for the film, he kept a journal containing many images, notes, and dialogue excerpts on A Clockwork Orange. Literature The original Chinese title of A Perfect Crime (下面我该干些什么?) by Chinese author A Yi (translated by Anna Holmwood) was based on the opening line of A Clockwork Orange: \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" Music *David Bowie started most of his concerts during his Ziggy Stardust period with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony from the film's soundtrack, and used the film as inspiration for stage costumes during that time. Bowie's lyric \\"say droogie don’t crash here!\\" in the song \\"Suffragette City\\" referenced Alex's word for his friends, and many of the lyrics in the song \\"Girl Loves Me\\" from his last album, Blackstar, are in Nadsat. *John Bonham of Led Zeppelin wore an outfit similar to Alex's while touring in 1975. *A Clockwork Orange, like other dystopian science fiction novels, had an important influence on industrial and cyberpunk music. *The WEA subsidiary record label Korova, named for the film's Korova Milk Bar, was founded in 1979 for post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen and later issued recordings by artists such as The Sound and Strawberry Switchblade. *Heaven 17, a synthpop band from Sheffield, England who formed in 1980, named themselves after a fictional pop group in the book and film. *Rosemary's Babies, a Hardcore Punk band from Lodi, New Jersey recorded the song \\"Ultraviolence, Sex and Death\\", for their Blood Lust EP later released on their compilation CD Talking to the Dead (album).

In the episode \\"Dog of Death\\" (March 12, 1992), Mr. Burns brainwashes the Simpsons' dog Santa's Little Helper into being one of his attack dogs by using the Ludovico technique. In the episode \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\", Bart speaks in a British accent and says \\"Can I slog off school tomorrow?

Also, in the episode \\"Duffless\\" (February 18, 1993), as a result of Lisa's electroshock therapy, Bart experiences difficulty in reaching for the cupcakes after dinner, in a manner similar to the effects of Alex's therapy; in particular, one shot parodies the film, with Bart looking up at the cupcakes on the table, in the same way Alex looks up to a naked woman's breasts after his therapy. In the episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XXI\\", at the end of a segment titled \\"Master and Cadaver\\", Maggie is seen wearing Alex's hat and eyelash. She drinks milk from her bottle with the film's theme song playing.

In the show's controversial 201st episode, \\"201\\" (2010), Mitch Connor (Cartman's hand-puppet) pretends to be a black man and asks to use the telephone at someone's house, alluding to the similar scene in A Clockwork Orange. In episode 206, \\"Coon 2: Hindsight\\" (2010), the scene where the Coon attacks the rest of his gang was reminiscent of the scene in which Georgie of Alexʼ Clockwork Orange droogs insists things be run in a \\"new way\\" that entails less power for Alex, who responds by attacking them while walking in order to re-establish his leadership. *In the Phineas and Ferb episode \\"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!\\" (2009), the military school the boys are sent to after getting busted uses the Ludovico technique in order to stop Phineas and Ferb from using their imagination. *In \\"Contorno\\", the fifth episode of season 3 of Hannibal (2015), the same section of Gioachino Rossini's The Thieving Magpie (as used in A Clockwork Orange) was played on a record player during a fight between Jack Crawford and Hannibal Lecter in Florence, Italy.

Biography Stoddard was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1850. In 1871 he graduated from Williams College. At Williams he was a member of the fraternity Delta Psi (aka St. Anthony Hall). Later he studied two years of theology at Yale Divinity School. After that he taught Latin and French at Boston Latin School.Dates and schooling from the biographical material in John L.

Stoddard's Lecturesarchive.org and eventually numbered 10 volumes and five supplements (1897–1898).Book dates taken from American Authors and Books. In 1901 Stoddard published a book on Gibraltar. The books include numerous illustrations derived from the immense catalog of photographs taken by Stoddard, and cover every subject, from art and architecture, to archaeology and natural history. The books were immensely popular in their day and many copies still survive. Later in life, Stoddard also published poetry, as well as books on religious subjects. Brought up a Protestant, Stoddard was an agnostic for more than 30 years before converting with his wife to Roman Catholicism. In 1922 he published Rebuilding a Lost Faith, a famous work of apologetics which is still in print.

He was born in Dublin, Ireland and attended Belvedere College and Trinity College Dublin. Political career Garland, an active member of the United Farmers of Alberta, was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1921 Canadian federal election as a candidate for the Progressive Party of Canada. He defeated two other candidates in a landslide to win his first term in office. A founding member of the radical Ginger Group of MPs, he stood for re-election in the 1925 Canadian federal election, he was barely re-elected in a hotly contested election to win his second term in office. The government was dissolved after the Liberal-Progressive coalition fell apart and he ran for re-election again just a year later in the 1926 Canadian federal election winning re-election this time under the United Farmers of Alberta banner. He stood for re-election and won his fourth term in the 1930 Canadian federal election. Garland was one of the group of radical MPs to meet following the 1930 election and plan the creation of a new party. He was a founding member of that party, the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation, when it was officially launched in 1932 and stood as a CCF candidate but was defeated on his bid for a fifth term in office in the 1935 Canadian federal election by Charles Edward Johnston from the Social Credit Party of Canada. He served as president of the UFA in the early 1930s.

According to this model, speakers adjust their speech primarily towards that of their audience in order to express solidarity or intimacy with them, or away from their audience's speech to express distance. History Earlier sociolinguistic research was primarily influenced by William Labov, who studied style-shifting as a function of attention paid to speech, and who developed techniques for eliciting various styles of speech during research interviews. Some sociolinguists have questioned whether Labov's categories of speech style apply outside the confines of the sociolinguistic interview, and some have suggested that attention to speech alone does not account for all types of style-shifting.Bell, A. (1984) Language Style as Audience Design. In Coupland, N. and A. Jaworski (1997, eds.) Sociolinguistics: a Reader and Coursebook, pp. 240-50. New York: St Mattin's Press Inc. Allan Bell's research The audience design model was inspired by Giles' communication accommodation theory and Bell's own research on the speech of radio news broadcasters in New Zealand. The study focused on two radio stations which shared the same recording studio and some of the same individual newsreaders. One station, National Radio, attracted an audience from higher socioeconomic brackets. The other, a local community station, drew a broader range of listeners including those from lower socioeconomic brackets. Bell's analysis of the newsreaders' speech revealed that they spoke differently based on the intended radio audience. He identified relationships in the frequency of sociolinguistic variables, such as postvocalic [t], which corresponded to the speech of the radio audiences. Bell proposed that because the topic of speech (identical news topics), speaker, and speech activity were the same, the most plausible way of accounting for the variation was that the newscasters were attuning their speech to what they perceived to be the norms for the respective radio audiences. Audience types The audience design framework distinguishes between several kinds of audience types based on three criteria from the perspective of the speaker: known (whether an addressee is known to be part of a speech context), ratified (the speaker acknowledges the listener's presence in the speech context), or addressed (the listener is directly spoken to). The impact of audience members on the speaker's style- shifting is proportional to the degree to which the speaker recognizes and ratifies them. Bell defined the following audience types: *Addressee – listeners who are known, ratified, and addressed *Auditor – listeners who are not directly addressed, but are known and ratified *Overhearer – non-ratified listeners of whom the speaker is aware *Eavesdropper – non-ratified listeners of whom the speaker is unaware Referee design In addition to audience design, Bell introduces an additional component of style shifting which he terms 'referee design'. This type of style-shifting refers to situations where the speaker does not accommodate to the speech style of their immediate audience, but rather \\"creatively uses language features ... from beyond the immediate speech community\\". In contrast with audience design which can be defined as a responsive style-shift where the speaker responds to specific factors of the speech context, referee design is characterised as an initiative shift. In such situations, speakers may use styles associated with non-present social groups to signal hypothetical allegiances with these speakers. For instance, Rickford and McNair-Knox (1994) examined the speech of Foxy Boston, an African-American teenager. Whilst on the whole they found that Foxy showed higher levels of AAVE features when communicating with African- American interviewers than with the European interviewer, thereby demonstrating the effect of audience design, in one situation Foxy showed considerably lower levels of AAVE features when interacting with the African- American interviewers. Interpreting these patterns, Rickford and McNair-Knox argue that Foxy's speech can be interpreted in terms of referee design. At the time, Foxy was attending a mainstream American High School where Standard American English was likely to be overtly prescribed. Thus, it is possible that Foxy was designing her speech to reflect the norms of a non-present speech community with which she identifies.

The largest naval base in Western Europe, HMNB Devonport is located in Devonport, in the west of the city of Plymouth, England. The base began as Royal Navy Dockyard in the late 17th century, but shipbuilding ceased at Devonport in the early 1970s, although ship maintenance work has continued. The now privatised maintenance facilities are operated by Babcock Marine, a division of Babcock International Group, who took over the previous owner Devonport Management Limited (DML) in 2007. DML had been running the Dockyard since privatisation in 1987. From 1934 until the early 21st century the naval barracks on the site was named HMS Drake (it had previously been known as HMS Vivid after the base ship of the same name). The name HMS Drake and its command structure has been extended to cover the entire base. The barracks buildings are now named the Fleet Accommodation Centre.Devonport Naval Base Handbook, 2010 In the early 1970s the newly styled 'Fleet Maintenance Base' was itself commissioned as HMS Defiance; it remained so until 1994, when it was amalgamated into HMS Drake. HM Naval Base Devonport is the home port of the Devonport Flotilla which includes the s. In 2009 the Ministry of Defence announced the conclusion of a long-running review of the long-term role of three naval bases. Devonport would no longer be used as a base for attack submarines after these moved to Faslane by 2017, and the Type 45 destroyers are based at Portsmouth. However, Devonport retains a long-term role as the dedicated home of the amphibious fleet, survey vessels and half the frigate fleet.Hansard House of Commons (23 February 2015) Defence questions History Drake House (the Commodore's residence), HMS Drake. In 1588, the ships of the English Navy set sail for the Spanish Armada through the mouth of the River Plym, thereby establishing the military presence in Plymouth. Sir Francis Drake is now an enduring legacy in Devonport, as the naval base has been named HMS Drake. Origins Plymouth Dockyard in 1798, by Nicholas Pocock. Centre front is Dummer's 1690s stone basin and dock: to its left, one double and two single dry docks; to its right, the 1761 double quadrangle storehouse. Behind the docks: pedimented workshops and the 1691 officers' terrace. On the right of the picture: building slips on the foreshore, with the smithery, timber stores, mast and boat houses beyond; then the long 1760s roperies and Mount Wise in the distance. In 1689 Prince William of Orange became William III and almost immediately he required the building of a new Royal Dockyard west of Portsmouth. Edmund Dummer, Surveyor of the Navy, travelled the West Country searching for an area where a dockyard could be built; he sent in two estimates for sites, one in Plymouth, Cattewater and one further along the coast, on the Hamoaze, a section of the River Tamar, in the parish of Stoke Damerel. Having dismissed the Plymouth site as inadequate, he settled on the Hamoaze area which soon became known as Plymouth Dock, later renamed Devonport. On 30 December 1690, a contract was let for a dockyard to be built: the start of Plymouth (later Devonport) Royal Dockyard. Having selected the location, Dummer was given responsibility for designing and building the new yard. At the heart of his new dockyard, Dummer placed a stone-lined basin, giving access to what proved to be the first successful stepped stone dry dock in Europe. Previously the Navy Board had relied upon timber as the major building material for dry docks, which resulted in high maintenance costs and was also a fire risk. The docks Dummer designed were stronger with more secure foundations and stepped sides that made it easier for men to work beneath the hull of a docked vessel. These innovations also allowed rapid erection of staging and greater workforce mobility. He discarded the earlier three-sectioned hinged gate, which was labour-intensive in operation, and replaced it with the simpler and more mobile two-sectioned gate. A further, double-dock (i.e. long enough to accommodate two ships of the line, end to end) was added, just north of the basin, in the 1720s.Historic England Grade II* listing: No 2 Dock, including bollards and capstans Dummer wished to ensure that naval dockyards were efficient working units that maximised available space, as evidenced by the simplicity of his design layout at Plymouth Dock. He introduced a centralised storage area (the quadrangular Great Storehouse) alongside the basin, and a logical positioning of other buildings around the yard. The southern boundary of his yard was formed by a 'double' rope-house (combining the previously separate tasks of spinning and laying within a single building); the upper floor was used for the repair of sails and a separate rigging house stood nearby. The smithery with its fire and forge was positioned to the north, safely separate from the other buildings. On high ground overlooking the rest of the yard he built a grand terrace of thirteen three-storey houses for the senior dockyard officers (the first known example in the country of a palace-front terrace); the commissioner was accommodated in the centre, and at each end of the terrace was a two-storey block of offices (one for the commissioner, the other for the Clerk of the Cheque). A chapel was built in 1700, alongside the Porter's Lodge at the main gate (it was destroyed by a fire in 1799). Most of these buildings and structures were rebuilt over ensuing years, including Dummer's original basin and dry dock (today known as No. 1 Basin and No. 1 Dock). The terrace survived into the 20th century, but was largely destroyed in the Blitz along with several others of Devonport's historic buildings. Just one end section of the terrace survives; dating from 1692 to 1696, it is the earliest surviving building in any royal dockyard. Development North and South Yards in 1909 From its original 17th-century site, the dockyard expanded in stages (first to the south and then progressively northwards) over the next centuries. The town that grew around the dockyard was called Plymouth Dock up to 1823, when the townspeople petitioned for it to be renamed Devonport. The dockyard followed suit twenty years later, becoming Devonport Royal Dockyard. In just under three centuries, over 300 vessels were built at Devonport, the last being HMS Scylla in 1971. =South Yard= Aerial view: South Yard (in the foreground) dates from 1690; the dockyard expanded northwards over ensuing centuries. The dockyard began in what is now known as the South Yard area of Devonport. It was here that Dummer built his groundbreaking stone dry dock (completely rebuilt in the 1840s). The numbers employed at the yard increased from 736 in 1711 to 2,464 in 1730. In the 1760s a period of expansion began, leading to a configuration which (despite subsequent rebuildings) can still be seen today : five slipways, four dry docks and a wet basin (slipways were used for shipbuilding, but the main business of the eighteenth-century yard was the repair, maintenance and equipping of the fleet, for which the dry docks and basin were used). One slipway (1774) survives unaltered from this period (Slip No.1): a rare survival. It is covered with a timber superstructure of 1814, a similarly rare and early survival of its type; indeed, only three such timber slip covers have survived in Britain, two of them at Devonport (the second of these, of similar vintage, stands over the former No.5 Slip; it was later converted to house the Scrieve Board, for full-size drafting of ship designs). The two additional docks were added, north of the double-dock, in 1762 and 1789 (both subsequently rebuilt). East Ropery (1763–71, rebuilt 1813–17). Before the expansion could begin, a rocky hillside to the south had to be cut away; the rubble was used to reclaim the mudflats ready for building. To open up the site, the old ropehouse was demolished and a new rope-making complex built alongside the east perimeter wall of the expanded site (where it still survives in part, albeit rebuilt following a fire in 1812). Where the old ropehouse had stood a short canal known as the Camber was laid out, terminating in a boat basin with a boathouse. On the New Ground to the south a new smithery was constructed, in 1776, containing 48 forges; though subsequently rebuilt it too still stands, the earliest surviving smithery in any royal dockyard. Initially used for the manufacture of anchors and smaller metal items, it would later be expanded to fashion the iron braces with which wooden hulls and decks began to be strengthened; as such, it provided a hint of the huge change in manufacturing technology that would sweep the dockyards in the nineteenth century as sail began to make way for steam, and wood for iron and steel. The most imposing building of this period was a double- quadrangular storehouse of 1761 (probably designed by Thomas Slade); replacing the Dummer's storehouse, it also incorporated a new rigging house and sail loft. It remained in use until it was destroyed in the Plymouth Blitz; the same fate befell several other buildings of the 18th and early 19th century, including the long and prominent pedimented workshop with its central clocktower, built to accommodate a range of woodworkers and craftsmen, the adjacent pedimented dockyard offices and Edward Holl's replacement Dockyard Church of 1814. The Fire on the morning of 27 September, 1840, by W. Clerk, after Nicholas Condy, which threatened to destroy the dockyard The dockyard suffered severe damage in a large-scale fire on 25 September 1840, it started in the North Dock on and were completely gutted, threatened the , and spread to nearby buildings and equipment. Estimates for the damage were put at £150,000 in the values of the day, and would have totalled £500,000 had the fire not been contained by demolishing several surrounding buildings. Despite significant damage during the blitz, the South Yard still contains four scheduled monuments and over thirty listed buildings and structures (though some of these have been allowed to fall into a derelict state in recent years: the 18th-century South Sawmills and South Smithery are both on the Heritage at Risk Register). In the space between the new slips and the new ropehouse, south of the boat pond, was a sizeable mast pond, flanked by mast-houses. =Morice Yard (New Gun Wharf)= Morice Yard viewed from the water: (l-r) No.4 Store, No.6 Sail Loft, No.5 Colour Loft, Officers' Terrace, No.3 Store, No.2 Store. Provision of ships' armaments was not the responsibility of the Navy but of the independent Board of Ordnance, which already had a wharf and storage facility in the Mount Wise area of Plymouth. This, however, began to prove insufficient and in 1719 the board established a new gun wharf on land leased from one Sir Nicholas Morice, immediately to the north of the established Dockyard. The Morice Yard was a self-contained establishment with its own complex of workshops, workers, officers, offices and storehouses. Gunpowder was stored on site, which began to be a cause for concern among local residents (as was the older store in the Royal Citadel within the city of Plymouth). In time new gunpowder magazines were built further north, first at Keyham (1770s), but later (having to make way for further dockyard expansion) relocating to Bull Point (1850).English Heritage: Thematic History of Ordnance Yards and Magazine Depots In contrast to South Yard, which fared badly in the Blitz, most of the original buildings survive at Morice Yard, enclosed behind their contemporary boundary wall; over a dozen of these are listed. On higher ground behind the wharf itself is a contemporary terrace of houses for officers (1720), built from stone rubble excavated during the yard's construction. Morice Ordnance Yard remained independent from the dockyard until 1941, at which point it was integrated into the larger complex. =The Devonport Lines= A \\"Plan of Stoke Town and Plymouth Dock\\" dated 1765 showing the course of the Devonport Lines as well as the docks and gun wharf. In 1758, the Plymouth and Portsmouth Fortifications Act provided the means to construct a permanent landward defence for the dockyard complex. The Devonport Lines were a bastion fortification which consisted of an earthen rampart with a wide ditch and a glacis. The lines ran from Morice Yard on the River Tamar, enclosing the whole dockyard and town, finally meeting the river again at Stonehouse Pool, a total distance of 2,000 yards (1,800 metres). There were four bastions, Marlborough Bastion to the north, Granby Bastion to the north-east, Stoke Bastion to the east and George Bastion to the south east. There were originally two gates in the lines, the Stoke Barrier at the end of Fore Street and the Stonehouse Barrier. A third gate called New Passage was created in the 1780s, giving access to the Torpoint Ferry. After 1860, the fortifications were superseded by the Palmerston Forts around Plymouth and the land occupied by the lines was either sold or utilised by the dockyard. =Keyham (the North Yard)= Clock tower and police office (formerly one of a pair flanking the gate to Keyham Steam Yard) In the mid-nineteenth century, all royal dockyards faced the challenge of responding to the advent first of steam power and then metal hulls. Those unable to expand were closed; the rest underwent a transformation through growth and mechanisation. alongside the wharf in front of the Quadrangle Building (left) and a covered dry dock, part of the Frigate Refit Complex (right) At Devonport, in 1864, a separate, purpose-built steam yard was opened on a self-contained site at Keyham, just to the north of Morice Yard (and a tunnel was built linking the new yard with the old). A pair of basins (8–9 acres each) were constructed: No. 2 Basin gave access to three large dry-docks, while No. 3 Basin was the frontispiece to a huge integrated manufacturing complex. This became known as the Quadrangle: it housed foundries, forges, pattern shops, boilermakers and all manner of specialized workshops. Two stationary steam engines drove line shafts and heavy machinery, and the multiple flues were drawn by a pair of prominent chimneys. The building still stands, and is Grade I listed; architectural detailing was by Sir Charles Barry. English Heritage calls it 'one of the most remarkable engineering buildings in the country'. The three dry docks were rebuilt, expanded and covered over in the 1970s to serve as the Frigate Refit Centre. HMS Westminster inside the Frigate Refit Complex, 2009. In 1880 a Royal Naval Engineering College was established at Keyham, housed in a new building just outside the dockyard wall alongside the Quadrangle where students (who joined at 15 years of age) gained hands-on experience of the latest naval engineering techniques. The Engineering College moved to nearby Manadon in 1958; the Jacobethan-style building then went on to house the Dockyard Technical College for a time, but was demolished in 1985. The 80-ton crane, a landmark of the Submarine Refit Centre since 1977, was dismantled in 2008. In 1895 the decision was taken to expand the Keyham Steam Yard to accommodate the increasing size of modern warships. By 1907 Keyham, now renamed the North Yard, had more than doubled in size with the addition of No. 4 and No. 5 Basins (of 10 and 35 acres respectively), linked by a very large lock-cum-dock, 730 ft in length, alongside three more dry-docks of a similar size, able to \\"accommodate ships larger than any war-vessel yet constructed\\". In the 1970s the northern end of No. 5 Basin was converted to serve as a new Fleet Maintenance Base, to be built alongside a Submarine Refit Complex for nuclear submarines; an 80-ton cantilever crane, one of the largest in western Europe, was installed to lift nuclear cores from submarines in newly built adjacent dry docks. Further north still, Weston Mill Lake (at one time Devonport's coaling yard) was converted in the 1980s to provide frigate berths for the Type 22 fleet. It is now where the Navy's amphibious warfare ships are based. In 2013 a new Royal Marines base, RM Tamar, was opened alongside; as well as serving as headquarters for 1 Assault Group Royal Marines, it can accommodate marines, alongside their ships, prior to deployment. In 2011 the MOD sold the freehold of the North Yard to the Dockyard operator, Babcock; the site includes six listed buildings and structures, among them the Grade I listed Quadrangle. =The naval barracks (HMS Drake)= Aerial view of HMS Drake Hulks at Devonport 8 September 1895 Until the late nineteenth century, sailors whose ships were being repaired or refitted, or who were awaiting allocation to a vessel, were accommodated in floating hulks. Construction of an onshore barracks, just north-east of the North Yard, was completed in 1889 with accommodation for 2,500; sailors and officers moved in in June of that year. In 1894 a contingent of sixty Royal Navy homing pigeons was accommodated on the site. Clock tower, HMS Drake The prominent clock tower was built in 1896, containing a clock and bell by Gillett & Johnston; it initially functioned as a semaphore tower. 1898 saw the barracks expand to accommodate a further 1,000 men. The wardroom block dates from this period. More buildings were added in the early years of the twentieth century, including St Nicholas's Church.A history of HMS Drake This part of the site contains some fourteen listed buildings and structures. Today The Royal Navy Dockyard consists of fourteen dry docks (docks numbered 1 to 15, but there is no 13 Dock), four miles (6 km) of waterfront, twenty-five tidal berths, five basins and an area of 650 acres (2.6 km2). The dockyard employs 2,500 service personnel and civilians, supports circa 400 local firms and contributes approximately 10% to the income of Plymouth. It is the base for the nuclear- powered hunter-killer submarines and the main refitting base for all Royal Navy nuclear submarines. Work was completed by Carillion in 2002 to build a refitting dock to support the Trident missile nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Devonport serves as headquarters for the Flag Officer Sea Training, which is responsible for the training of all the ships of the Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary, along with many from foreign naval services. The nuclear submarine refit base was put into special measures in 2013 by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and it could be 2020 before enhanced monitoring ceases. Safety concerns on ageing facilities, stretched resources and increasing demand are blamed for the measures. Devonport Flotilla Ships based at the port are known as the Devonport Flotilla. This includes the Navy's assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark. It also serves as home port to most of the hydrographic surveying fleet of the Royal Navy and seven Type 23 frigates. In 2018 the Defence Secretary announced that the proposed new Type 26 frigates would all be based at Devonport. =Amphibious assault ships= Ocean (decommissioned) berthed ahead of Albion in Devonport Dockyard * HMS Albion landing platform dock; * HMS Bulwark landing platform dock (In extended readiness). =Type 23 frigates= HMS Portland moored by the Quadrangle building * HMS Argyll * HMS Monmouth (In extended readiness) * HMS Montrose (Currently forward deployed to Bahrain for 3 years) * HMS Northumberland * * HMS Portland (Currently in LIFEX refit) * HMS Somerset (Currently in LIFEX refit) * HMS Sutherland * (Currently in LIFEX refit) In changes to base porting arrangements announced in November 2017, HM Ships Argyll, Monmouth and Montrose will join the Portsmouth Flotilla; HM Ships Westminster, Richmond, Kent and St Albans will move in the opposite direction.

St Albans moved to Devonport in July 2019 in preparation for her major refit. =Trafalgar- class submarines= HMS Talent at the Fleet Maintenance Base * HMS Trenchant * HMS Triumph =Surveying squadron= HMS Scott at Devonport * HMS Echo * HMS Enterprise * HMS Magpie * HMS Scott =Antarctic patrol ship= * Other units based at Devonport * Flag Officer Sea Training * Hydrographic, Meteorological & Oceanographic Training Group * HQ Amphibious Task Group * HMS Vivid RNR * RM Tamar/47 Commando Royal Marines ** 10 Landing Craft Training Squadron ** 4 Assault Squadron ** 6 Assault Squadron ** 9 Assault Squadron ** 539 Assault Squadron * Hasler NSRC (Naval Service Recovery Centre) & Hasler Company Royal Marines * Southern Diving Group RN * Defence Estates South West * HQ Western Division Ministry of Defence Police * CID Devonport MOD Police * DSG Devonport MOD Police South Yard redevelopment Listed buildings in the South Yard, including South Sawmills and Smithery (left), No. 1 Slip (centre) and King's Hill Gazebo (top right). Several sections of the historic South Yard are no longer used by the Ministry of Defence, though it is still currently a closed site and subject to security restrictions. The deep-water access it offers has made the site desirable for manufacturers of 'superyachts' and in 2012 Princess Yachts acquired the freehold to 20 acres at the southern end, with a view to building a construction facility. The company asserts that this development will \\"continue the boat building tradition within the dockyard\\" and \\"add drama to the site with yachts being moved around the quayside, launched on No. 3 Slip, tested in No. 2 Slip and moored alongside the quay wall\\". The site includes within it several listed buildings and scheduled ancient monuments, most notably the Grade I listed East Ropery, together with several other 18th- century buildings and structures associated with rope-making in the Yard, the covered slip (No. 1 Slip) and the 'King's Hill Gazebo', built to commemorate a visit by King George III. In 2014 it was announced, as part of a 'City Deal' regeneration agreement, that the South Yard would be 'unlocked' with a view to it becoming a 'marine industries hub'. As of 2016 the northern section of the South Yard (including the 18th-century dry docks, Nos. 2, 3 & 4) was being redeveloped in phases, with a marketing strategy focused on 'the development of marine industries and the high growth area of marine science and technology'; it has been renamed Oceansgate. Areas to the south and east (with the exception of the area now occupied by Princess Yachts) are being retained by the MOD, with No. 4 Slip having been recently refurbished for use with landing craft. =Museum= Former Fire Station (1851) within the South Yard. The Devonport Naval Heritage Centre is a maritime museum in Devonport's Historic South Yard. Run by volunteers, it is only accessible for pre-booked tours, or on Naval Base open days. Plymouth Naval Base Museum opened in 1969 following an appeal from the office of the Admiral-superintendent for items of memorabilia and was housed in the Dockyard Fire Station. Since then, the museum has expanded and now occupies, in addition, the 18th-century Pay Office and Porter's Lodge. The Scrieve Board (Project Managed by PDM) currently serves as a museum store. Discussions were underway in 2014 around removing the museum from the Dockyard and displaying some of its collections within an expanded Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery. The nuclear-powered submarine HMS Courageous, used in the Falklands War, is preserved in North Yard as a museum ship, managed by the Heritage Centre.  Nuclear submarine decommissioning  Thirteen out of service nuclear submarines were stored at Devonport in 2018.  (defuelled and preserved in North Yard as a museum ship)    * In 2018, the UK Parliament's Public Accounts Committee criticised the slow rate of decommissioning of these submarines, with the Ministry of Defence admitting that it had put off decommissioning due to the cost. The National Audit Office in 2019 stated that the costs of laid up storage of all nuclear submarines had reached £500 million, and they represent a liability of £7.5 billion. Nickname visiting Devonport The Naval base at Devonport is still nicknamed \\"Guzz\\" (or, sometimes, \\"Guz\\") by sailors and marines. One suggestion is that this originates from the word guzzle (to eat or drink greedily), which is likely to refer to the eating of cream teas, a West Country delicacy and, therefore, one with strong connections to the area around Plymouth. Another explanation advanced is that \\"GUZZ\\" was the radio call sign for the nearby Admiralty wireless station (which was GZX) at Devil's Point, (citing Brimacombe, Peter, \\"The History of HMS Drake\\", Rodney Brimacombe, Mor Marketing, Plymouth, July 1992.) though this is disputed and has recently been disproved by reference to actual wireless telegraphy callsigns in existence over the past century.See, for example: Another explanation is that the name came from the Hindi word for a yard (36 inches), \\"guz\\", (also spelled \\"guzz\\", at the time) which entered the Oxford English Dictionary, and Royal Navy usage, in the late 19th century, as sailors used to regularly abbreviate \\"The Dockyard\\" to simply \\"The Yard\\", leading to the slang use of the Hindi word for the unit of measurement of the same name. The Plymouth Herald newspaper attempted to summarise the differing theories, but no firm conclusion was reached. Charles Causley referred to Guz in one of his poems, \\"Song of the Dying Gunner A.A.1\\", published in 1951. A \\"tiddy oggy\\" is naval slang for a Cornish Pasty and which was once the nickname for a sailor born and bred in Devonport.Jolly, Rick (1989), Jackspeak: A guide to British Naval slang & usage, Conway (Bloomsbury Publishing Plc) (p. 462) The traditional shout of \\"Oggy Oggy Oggy\\" was used to cheer on the Devonport team in the Navy's field gun competition. Nuclear waste leaks Devonport has been the site of a number of leaks of nuclear waste associated with the nuclear submarines based there. * November 2002: \\"Ten litres of radioactive coolant leaked from \\" * October 2005: \\"Previous reported radioactive spills at the dockyard include one in October 2005, when it was confirmed 10 litres of water leaked out as the main reactor circuit of HMS Victorious was being cleaned to reduce radiation.\\" * November 2008: \\"The Royal Navy has confirmed up to 280 litres of water, likely to have been contaminated with tritium, poured from a burst hose as it was being pumped from the submarine in the early hours of Friday.\\" * March 2009: \\"On 25 March radioactive water escaped from HMS Turbulent while the reactor's discharge system was being flushed at the Devonport naval dockyard\\" Administration=Commissioners of the Navy Up until 1832 the Plymouth Royal Dockyard, was administered by a Commissioner of the Navy on behalf of the Navy Board in London included: =Resident Commissioners Plymouth= * Captain Henry Greenhill, appointed 25 December 1691 * Captain George St Lo, appointed 26 March 1695 * Captain William Wright, appointed 1 May 1703 * Captain Henry Greenhill, appointed February 1704 * Captain William Wright, appointed 1 July 1708 * Captain Richard Edwards, appointed 19 June 1711 * Captain Sir William Jumper Kt., appointed 12 November 1714 * Captain Thomas Swanton, appointed 30 March 1715 * Captain Francis Dove, appointed 23 July 1716 * Captain Sir Nicholas Trevanion, appointed 22 April 1726 * Captain Matthew Morris, appointed 9 December 1737 * Captain Philip Vanbrugh, appointed 8 January 1738 * Captain Sir Frederick Rogers, Bart., appointed 3 October 1753 * Captain Paul Henry Ourry, appointed 30 January 1775 * Mr Edward Le Cras, appointed December 1782 * Captain Sir John Laforey, Bart., appointed 6 May 1784 * Captain Robert Fanshawe, appointed 13 November 1789 * Captain William Shield, appointed 12 December 1815–1822 =Resident Commissioners Devonport= * Captain William Shield, 1823–1828 * Captain Charles B H Ross, appointed 13 March 1829.

Admiral Superintendents of the yard In 1832 the Navy Board was abolished, everything except the gun wharves were brought under the direct control of the Admiralty. A serving Royal Navy officer, usually of rear-admiral rank, was appointed as admiral-superintendent of the dockyard; however, the post was sometimes held by a commodore- superintendent or even a vice-admiral.

In 1956, he took part in the now infamous attack on five missionaries during Operation Auca. He is believed to have speared both Nate Saint and Ed McCully during the attack. In 1958, missionaries made peaceful contact with the Huaorani tribe. They came to live with them, learned their language, and taught them the Bible. Mincaye soon converted to Christianity. He eventually became a preacher and an elder in the Waodani church, and became one of the most outspoken of the Huao Christians. He said of the change he saw in his tribe, \\"We acted badly, badly, until they brought us God's carvings (the Bible). Then, seeing His carvings and following His good trail, now we live happily and in peace.\\" Mincaye became especially close with Nate Saint's son Steve, who lived in the tribe for many years. Because he had killed Steve Saint's father, Mincaye felt a special responsibility in raising him. A kinship bond was developed, and Mincaye adopted Saint as his tribal son. After the Saint family came to live permanently with the Huaorani in 1995, Mincaye considered the Saint children his grandchildren. In 1997, Mincaye travelled to the United States for the first time. He made several trips with Steve Saint where they made appearances together. In 2000 they attended Amsterdam 2000, an international evangelism conference presented by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He also travelled with Steven Curtis Chapman during his \\"Live Out Loud\\" tour.. Mincaye also appeared in the 2004 documentary Beyond the Gates of Splendor. He was interviewed and appeared as himself. The 2006 film End of the Spear largely tells the story of Mincaye and Steve Saint's lives. Mincaye was portrayed by Marco Flaco as a child and Louie Leonardo as an adult. He also made a brief cameo appearance towards the end of the film, in the scene reenacting the funeral of Rachel Saint.

Dawn News' test transmission was launched by former President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf.'Media first line of defence': DawnNews TV's test transmission Dawn (newspaper), Published 26 May 2007, Retrieved 4 June 2018 The complete launch of the channel coincided with the result of the Supreme Court case which cleared the Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who had been suspended by General Musharraf. The channel was initially housed in Haroon House, the head-office of PHPL, but later moved to its current premises in West Wharf, Karachi. The channel has an online stream available on its website for foreign viewing. History of the parent organisation The founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah launched the Dawn newspaper in the 1940s - it is the oldest English language newspaper in Pakistan. DawnNews was launched as Pakistan's first English news and current affairs channel and vows to \\"provide its viewers with a medium that is responsible, credible and balanced.\\" The channel has bureaux in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Quetta and Peshawar, with studio facilities in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including digital satellite news gathering (DSNG) capability and broadband global area networks (BGANs), the channel has the capacity to provide live transmission from remote areas via satellite, thus enabling comprehensive and prompt news coverage from across the country. After a brief test transmission, the channel went live on 23 July 2007. Over the past few years the channel has established its fame being the most credible voice in the murky pool of electronic media, in Pakistan. Keeping in view the public demand, DawnNews had decided to launch a separate Urdu news channel. But before launching the separate channel, it had started a three-hour Urdu transmission within its English channel’s airtime, which was later increased to 12 hours. The channel officially put an end to its English language programming on 15 May 2010. DawnNews has broken a number of big stories. It was DawnNews which exclusively broadcast the footage of the assassin of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. It was DawnNews that got official confirmation from Pakistan that lone surviving gunman of Mumbai terror attacks – Ajmal Kasab – was a Pakistani. Besides, DawnNews has covered major events including Lal Masjid, Islamabad operation, lawyers’ movement, military operations in tribal areas and Pakistani general election, 2008. Most of the time, the channel beat its rivals despite limited resources. DawnNews transmission is watched in all urban areas of Pakistan. It also has access to the rural population, wherever the cable reaches. DawnNews is in agreement with several satellite TV channels, which include BBC World News, Sky News, ABC News and Aljazeera and can be watched in the US, Europe, Middle East and Africa.

The company was established in 1978 by Bob and Charlee Moore. Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods is a producer of natural, certified organic, and gluten-free milled grain products, billing itself as the \\"nation's leading miller of diverse whole-grain foods.\\" Its products are distributed throughout the United States, Canada, and a number of other locations such as the Caribbean. It produces over 400 products, primarily whole grains that are ground with quartz millstones which come from several 120-year-old mills, as well as baking mixes, beans, seeds, nuts, dried fruits, spices, and herbs. They are sold through seventy natural food and specialty grocery distributors in the United States and Canada, their online store, and the company's factory store and restaurant. History Moore's beginnings as a business owner was in gasoline, not grains. In the 1950s, he briefly owned a filling station in Los Angeles. The smog in the city influenced Bob and his wife Charlee to sell the station, and move to Mammoth Lakes, a small resort town in the mountains just to the north of Los Angeles where he opened a second gas station. It failed after a year and the family was forced to move temporarily into a rental owned by their minister. Moore got a job working as a manager at a Firestone Tires store and got back on his feet. He bought a five-acre goat farm where he and Charlee raised their boys. He and his sons sold milk and eggs locally. Charlee began experimenting with baking whole grain breads. Moore's drive for healthier foods started with his father's death of a heart attack at age 49, and his grandmother's healthy eating obsession. He began experimenting with stone ground flours in the mid 1960s after reading \\"John Goffe's Mill,\\" a book about an archeologist who rebuilt a flour mill and went into business with no prior experience. Stone grinding, largely abandoned when the flour industry moved to steel rollers, used quartz millstones that operate at lower temperatures and blend the germ, its oil, the bran, and the endosperm, preserving the nutrition in the grains. He found his first traditional stone- grinding flour millstones from a company in North Carolina while he was working, at the time, for J.C. Penney. The equipment sat for a few years until Moore, his wife, and two of his three sons started their first mill business, Moore's Flour Mill in Redding, California. Bob and his wife retired from the Redding Mill and left one of his sons to run it. That mill still produces some products under contract with Moore's current company. The Moores moved to Portland, where Bob attended a seminary to study the Bible for about six months. Bob found a commercial flour mill in Oregon City that was for sale, painted it red, and went back into the flours business. Moore bought mill stones from the closed Boyd mill near Dufur, Oregon. He acquired other stones from old mills in Indiana and Tennessee. The business that is now Bob's Red Mill began producing stone ground flours and cereals for the local area. In 1978, Moore sold direct through his store until he made a deal with the Fred Meyer grocery stores to carry his products In 1988, annual sales to area health food stores and smaller grocers were approaching $3M when the original mill was destroyed by an arsonist's fire. The stones were spared from the fire. Grain from the second floor fell on them in the fire which extinguished the flames around the mills themselves, keeping the quartz stones from shattering in the heat, and preserving the gears that turned them. The company built a new mill in Milwaukie, Oregon after Moore was flown around the state by friends unsuccessful in finding an existing mill that would do. The couple borrowed $2.5M to rebuild the factory and warehouse in a new 60,000 sq. ft. facility. Bob continued to grow the business by working with small markets, local retail and larger wholesale customers, rather than a corporate approach. The Moores were early to the whole grains movement, when other suppliers were making more money making faster, cheaper product. They also were one of the first gluten-free mills in 1991, and one of the first to offer specialty grains and cereals in retail-sized packaging. They were the one of the first flour mills to build labs that tested their products to certify organic and gluten-free compliance. In 1996, the Moores took on partners to expand and pay off their debt. Dennis Gilliam, who came from the printing business, became their vice-president of sales and marketing. John Wagner became vice-president of administration. Gilliam expanded the company wholesaling with California- based Quality Brokerage and Nature's Best, the company's first large regional distributors. Wagner helped the company control debt by building and repairing machinery in-house, and through the purchasing of used machinery needed for expansion from older and closed mills like Seattle-based Fisher Mills, Inc. Bob Moore, founder of Bob's Red Mill In 2005, it was estimated that Bob's Red Mill's annual revenue was between US$30 million and $50 million. In June 2007, the company announced that it was moving both its administrative headquarters, and manufacturing and warehousing facility to a building from its original facility, which it planned to sell and sub-lease. Its current manufacturing facility is . The new facility will triple the company's manufacturing capacity. As of 2005, its products were available in Japan and the company intends to expand distribution to other countries. In February 2010, owner Bob Moore transferred ownership of the company to his employees using an employee stock ownership plan. Bob's Red Mill was the site of a COVID-19 outbreak in late May 2020. By June 3, there were 19 infections. The risk to the public was low. Philanthropy In 2011, the Moores donated $5 million to Oregon State University to develop a center to study whole grains and over $1 million to a local naturopathic college, both for the study of childhood obesity.

The history of Anguillian sailing is often indistinguishable from the history of the island itself. Sailing craft date back to the Taino and Arawak peoples who inhabited Anguilla before the British Colonisation. However these craft have had little influence on the unique sailing practiced in Anguilla. Instead, it originated from the fishing vessels constructed and built locally after colonization and the subsequent collapse of the local plantation system to provide food and modest income to the inhabitants. A modern square rigger viewed from Long Bay \\"The Battle of Anguilla\\" The earliest reference to sailing in Anguillian history involves what is unofficially known as \\"The Battle of Anguilla\\". In 1796, during the height of the Napoleonic Wars, 400 men were dispatched from the neighboring French colony of St. Martin aboard two frigates, Le Decius and Le Valiant. This force landed on what is now known as Rendezvous Bay. An Anguillian defense force was led by Lieutenant Governor Benjamin Gumbs, and for the next four days they were beaten back through the capital of The Valley and onto Sandy Hill, where they fortified themselves in a former Dutch Fort. Desperate for ammunition, they were said to have used lead weights from fishing nets and musket shot, and an Anguillian sailing ship was sent to St. Kitts to request aid. This ship, whose name was not recorded, came into contact with the H.M.S. Lapwing led by Commander Barton. Barton acted swiftly to relieve Anguilla, and the Lapwing's presence drove the French to attempt to retreat. Le Decius and Le Valiant fled and attempted to escape the British frigate, leaving the soldiers stranded. They surrendered to the Anguillian forces, were imprisoned and then massacred in retaliation for the massive amount of damage inflicted by the invaders. The Lapwing sank Le Decius and drove the Le Valiant onto the rocks in St. Martin, where it was set ablaze.Carty, D. (1997). \\"Nuttin Bafflin\\": The Story of the Anguilla Racing Boat. Anguilla Effects The Battle of Anguilla had several interesting cultural effects on the island. Rendezvous was named because it was the site where the French held their \\"rendezvous\\" for the invasion. Lead sinker balls are referred to locally as \\"bullets\\" after the desperate attempts of the besieged militia. However, the main effect was a result of the devastation inflicted on the plantations, in addition to the island's naturally arid climate and hurricanes doomed large scale agricultural efforts. By 1821, plantations were almost totally eliminated. Despite this, Anguillian subsistence farmers managed to grow corn, pigeon peas and other staples. The surplus of especially good yields was shipped overseas. However, as a result of the failure to maintain effectively the only profitable economy it could as a British colony it fell into poverty. Twice, in 1832 and 1843, the Governor of the Leeward Islands recommended a complete evacuation of the island and resettlement of the residents to Guyana and Trinidad. With no other alternative, the Anguillian people turned to maritime occupations - fishermen, shipwrights, riggers and traders. It is considered ironic that the name of the Anguillian ship which was sent for rescue, almost undoubtedly the forerunner of the modern Anguillian racing boat was lost, while the name of the Lapwing survives as a favored name for boats even today, especially among the police force boats. Trade with Nova Scotia After the American Revolution the Navigation Acts banned trade between the new United States of America and the British West Indian colonies. Canadian territories, especially schooners from Nova Scotia filled this gap in trade. These ships exported Canadian timber and fish and were then reloaded with West Indian sugar, rum, molasses and salt. Salt Industry The salt industry began in 1769 providing Anguilla with an export. This industry was based in the village known as \\"Sandy Ground\\", which is situated on a stretch of sand between the large Road Salt Pond and Road Bay. Anguilla has roughly of salt ponds, less than half of that of the Turks and Caicos. Although it lacked plantations and had smaller salt ponds, the salt industry benefited from close proximity to Demerrara, Trinidad, Barbados, Antigua and St. Kitts. Schooners returning to Canada from these colonies would make a last stop in Anguilla or St. Martin to purchase salt. These ships would jettison their ballast in Road Bay as the salt was loaded on board. The granite rocks used as ballast accumulated at the northern end of Road Bay and formed a reef known locally as \\"The Ballast\\". An 1880 map of Sombrero, showing the mining operations Phosphate Mining The short lived phosphate mining industry was a major source of income for Anguilla in the 19th century. Although there was some mining on the mainland of Anguilla, the majority of the phosphates were mined from quarries on Sombrero. Beginning in 1860, American entrepreneurs invested in several pieces of equipment and construction on the island, including a steam railway, accommodation for workers from Anguilla, a rock crusher and several loading points for ships. The operations on Sombrero declined drastically in 1880, and the supply had been exhausted by 1890. Effect of industries The presence of the schooners and the income from the trading allowed Anguillian sailing to advance. Shipwrighting and rigging were honed considerably during this period. Foreign exchange earnings allowed the purchase of metal pieces for use on ships, such as hawse-pipes and deck pumps. Anguillians who sailed with Canadian and other crews were able to learn and teach new knowledge and traditions to Anguillian sailing peers, improving sailing knowledge in Anguilla. In addition, due to a Canadian policy of replacing Grand Bank fishing schooners after 10 years. Many of these were purchased by Anguillians. By the end of the 19th century, an impressive number of the roughly 4,000 residents of Anguilla owned a trading sloop or schooner. These Anguillians earned a living with their vessels by running a trading fleet. They mostly made shipments for merchants from more prosperous islands. Uniquely among trading boats in the Caribbean, Anguillian boats deducted running expenses from gross earnings, and then the pay was divided up as follows: The owner earned one third of the net earnings and the remaining two thirds. The captain was then paid an additional half-share of the captain's earning. This scheme, known as the \\"Share Plan\\", was typically used by fishermen, but only by traders in this case. Migration to Santo Domingo In 1895, major American investment spurred the growth of the sugar industry in the Dominican Republic. Large plantations recruited cane cutters from Eastern Caribbean islands - Particularly, St. Martin, Tortola, Anguilla, St. Kitts and Antigua. Although the pay was merely $0.17 per ton of cane and conditions were poor, the opportunity was considered a \\"saviour\\" by those who took it up, especially among the still poverty stricken Anguilla. The Anguillian trading fleet found it an even greater opportunity - Many of the labourers from islands in the southern end of the archipelago came to St. Martin to find transportation to Santo Domingo. In addition, the exchange also opened up new trade routes between the Eastern Caribbean and Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. However, British law limited the number of passengers to a number equal to its weight in tons. Most schooners, weighing between sixty and ninety tons, were limited to sixty to ninety passengers. To avoid this law, the ships would load to full legal capacity in Anguilla and leave for St. Martin. Once in Marigot, under French jurisdiction, they would be allowed to take on as many passengers as they desired. Usually each schooner carried roughly two hundred men in cramped conditions on leaving Marigot. The schooners (and occasionally sloops) would leave St. Martin on the first or second of January. The ships would leave en masse, on a downwind run to Santo Domingo and La Romana. (The wind typically blows from the east in the West Indies.) On these downwind legs, the crew of each vessel would often attempt to outrun each other to alleviate the boredom of a journey that often took four days. The return trip in July, being a beat directly to windward, was difficult and long, taking up to twenty-one days. It was also more competitive, with much debate on tactics and weight distribution on each ship. Some even breached international navigation rules and switched their starboard and port lights in attempt to fool their opponents. In addition to being a source of entertainment, the schooners that could outrun their opponents were able to deliver their loads home faster. Those with a reputation for speed were able to charge more per passenger, and were usually guaranteed a full load of passengers. Even after the schooners had been derigged and the crews turned to fishing, their passion for racing and sailing experience carried on into the smaller fishing craft. The racing fervor was not limited to crew, however. Passengers on the boats were spectators and volunteers, usually rooting for the boat that they were traveling on. In addition, as most of the able-bodied men were employed as either mariners or cane cutters, the elderly, women and children highly anticipated the return of the schooners. On the event of the top of a mast being spotted, eager loved ones on shore would watch anxiously as two or three ships would fight for first anchorage. In this way, with essentially all Anguillians in one way or another involved in the boat race, it would have an indelible mark upon the culture of the island. Many stories are passed down of this time, often considered the \\"golden age\\" of Anguillian sailing. On one occasion the Ismay and the Warspite were close at the end of the journey to their anchorage in Sandy Ground. These impromptu races would cause great excitement among the people in Anguilla, especially in Sandy Ground, who had their own favourite. The Ismay usually won. On one occasion, the Warspite was tacking back and forth up to the anchorage. The Ismay was on a long tack and passed close to Sandy Island and continued all the way up until she was almost under the lee of the hills. Many of her supporters, some of whom had placed bets, were worried that the hills would kill her wind. It was a beautiful sight to see the Ismay under full sail. The Warspite looked certain to win. Then the Ismay tacked and in a straight reach beat the Warspite to the mooring. The congregation in a church on South Hill slowly emptied as the worshipers slowly went out toi watch, finally followed by the Minister.(Source Daphne Gillanders née Lake -Captain Olando Lake's daughter). The schooners became legends and their captains became heroes in Anguillian history. Some of the notable ships include the Yolanda (owned by Captain Olando Lake), the Ismay (Captained by Orlando Lake and now commemorated on the Anguilla $3.00 stamp) and the Warspite (captained by Joe Romney). The Warspite, which continued sailing decades later under various captains, was later commemorated as a symbol of Anguilla and featured on the EC ten dollar bill. In 1930 the dictator Rafael Trujillo rose to power in the Dominican Republic. The resulting instability and terror sent the schooner trade into decline, and was finished by the end of the decade. The trading fleet switched over to sailing up and down the islands for irregular cargo duties. Fishing Fishing was the main source of food for Anguillians, though it was complemented by subsistence farming. Surplus fish were sold in St. Martin to support the purchase of foods such as flour, rice, cornmeal and salt pork, which were unavailable in Anguilla otherwise. The boats were typically between 17 and , with no deck. The mast was tall and made of soursop wood, with mainsails made of 8 ounce duck cloth and jibs of 7 ounce \\"duck\\". Three times a week they would leave their villages before dawn and set fish traps at reefs along the length of the island. Usual catches included grouper, butterfish, goatfish, grunt, snapper, oldwife and hammerheads (a blue fish which is now rarely seen). The fish were sold in \\"straps\\" (six to eight pounds of fish strung together through the gills) for between two and four pence. As refrigeration was unavailable at the time, boats were required to reach shore before midday to sell their catch quickly. They typically sailed in convoys of three or four boats from a particular village. If one boat finished fishing before the others in its convoys, it would \\"lay to\\" (furl the jib and slacken the mainsail) and wait for the others. Once all were finished, they would race home. These impromptu competitions were the basis for modern Anguillian races. Smuggling As a result of living off of mainly fishing and subsistence farming, Anguillians had little money to hire labor for plowing, or \\"holing ground\\" as it was locally called. Instead, a communal effort called \\"jollification\\" would provide the labor for such a task. Several neighbors and friends of the person who needed the help would gather and work together to prepare the ground. This labor would be paid for in demijohns of rum which would be available at the jollification.With little money, Anguillians could hardly the exorbitant duties on rum - a gallon of rum purchased in St. Martin for 3 shillings in the 1930s would cost 20 shillings including tax. Instead of paying this, the majority of the fishing boats began to smuggle at night. Although the majority of the cargo was rum, staples including flour, rice and sugar were also smuggled. Contraband would be loaded in St. Martin and then carried at night to Sandy Hill Bay and Little Harbour on the southern side of the island and occasionally to Mead's Bay (then Maid's Bay) on the northern side of the island. The sales were legal in St. Martin, and friendly suppliers would open themselves for business at night as a convenience to smugglers. Jules Petit in particular was a major supplier and owner of an infamous racing boat, the Polaris, which led the St. Martin contingent to races in Anguilla. Police efforts in Anguilla at the time were concentrated on capturing smugglers, which made them unpopular among the people - on one occasion, police escorting two captured smugglers were assaulted and the smugglers freed. (They were re-arrested the next morning.) Many stories and calypsos have been written about the exploits of the smugglers and confrontations with the police and colonial magistrate from St. Kitts. The smuggling boats were typically small, quick and maneuverable fishing boats with an easily collapsible rigging. The ideal smuggling boat would be able to sail across the channel from St. Martin laden with cargo and arrive in Anguilla well before dawn. Upon arrival, it was necessary to collapse the sail and rigging quickly to avoid attracting attention of the authorities. This design lent itself well to racing, and as a result the smuggling boat is the direct forerunner of the Anguillian racing sloop. Communities and families highly prized the smuggling boats, and depended on them to outwit the Revenue Officers. This passion was a precedent to the modern racing fervor. Regattas There are regular sailing regattas on national holidays which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These regattas do not conform to international sailing rules with regard to right of way. Instead, there is only one rule, known as the \\"hard lee\\" rule. (The name derives from the motion required to tack a tiller boat, which is to push the tiller \\"hard to leeward\\"). In the event that two boats on opposite tacks are on a collision course, one or both of the captains may elect to call \\"hard lee\\" to the other. When this call is made, both boats must tack regardless of whether it is advantageous or not. The objective of this manoeuvre is to attempt to gain as much distance upwind as possible before having to tack to avoid a collision. Alternatively, one captain may decide to \\"draw\\" and either tack earlier or change his point of sail to avoid the manoeuvre. This means a loss in height, but it may be preferable to tacking towards a shallow reef or other unfavourable position. August Week Throughout the English-speaking Caribbean the first Monday in August is a national holiday commemorating the Emancipation Act passed by the British House of Commons on July 31, 1833. The act took effect on August 1, 1834 and freed all slaves under British control. Before 1840 Before 1840, August Monday in Anguilla was celebrated at \\"Landsome Pasture\\" (Now Ronald Webster Park). The Anglican Vestry would organize a fair, bazaar and sports meet. A few days prior, the schooner Betsy or the sloops Speed would sail to St. Kitts for supplies including ice packed in sawdust. This fair would last from ten in the morning until sunset, and the proceeds went towards the church. Fishing villages would celebrate informally by holding \\"stem-to-stem\\" races between fishing boats. West End, Island Harbour, Sandy Ground and Blowing Point would hold their own races with little organization and no prizes. Each village had their own roster of racers and their own courses. August Monday Boat races The first organized regatta on August Monday can be credited to good friends Melrose MacArthur Owen and William Elliot Carty, both residents of North Hill. \\"Mac\\" Owen was a highly respected, multi-talented man who was respected island-wide. The son of Herbert Owen (a principle Sombrero lighthouse keeper), he was employed at \\"The Factory\\" (a general store, small cotton gin and blacksmith's shop), he often experimented with plumbing, electricity and machines at a time when such objects were rare in Anguilla. Despite seldom reading, he was technically gifted and his advice was often sought for repairs varying from roofs to cars. He was also a notable local cricketer. One of the few Anguillians to not fish for a living, he viewed sailing as a sport and developed his boats as such. His vessel, the Violet, a formidable craft, was noteworthy for its odd initial launching (It was lowered down a steep hillside near his home) and its purpose - unlike most Anguillian sailing craft, it was designed first for racing and secondly for fishing. He was known for being reserved and thoughtful, preferring to think deeply before giving his opinion (often some days later). Elliot Carty, on the other hand, was known for his spontaneous, aggressive and forceful nature. The son of Arthur Romney Carty, owner of the Warspite, he was heavily involved in schooner building, fishing/racing boat building, fishing, trading, rigging and most things associated with boats and the sea. He is credited with building Anguilla's largest schooner, the Liberator, in addition to several others. He took over the management of the Warspite after his father became too ill to work, and later passed it down to Sir Emile Gumbs, his nephew.

It contains two species: * Five-striped sparrow Amphispiza quinquestriata * Black-throated sparrow, Amphispiza bilineata It has long been considered to contain the sage sparrow complex as well, but mitochondrial DNA sequences suggest that the sage sparrow (in the broad sense) is not very closely related to the five-striped and black-throated sparrows, so it has been placed in its own genus, Artemisiospiza, a treatment followed here. Both Amphispiza species inhabit dry areas of the western United States and northern Mexico, but in different habitats. They frequently run on the ground with their tails cocked and sing from low bushes. Adults are whitish on the belly and gray above and on the head, with black and white head markings. Juveniles are rather similar to each other, grayish brown above and whitish below, with short streaks on the breast. The genus name Amphispiza derives from the two Ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"on both sides\\" or \\"around\\", and (), a catch-all term for finch-like birds, originally applied to the sage sparrow.

He was an influential figure in the history of modern Chinese central bank. Biography Chang was born in 1889 in Jiading outside of Shanghai. His grandfather was a Qing dynasty official and his father a doctor, so he and his siblings enjoyed educational opportunities not available to most of their countrymen. While his brother, Carsun Chang distinguished himself in the world of politics, Chang Kia-ngau became a leading figure in modern Chinese banking. Chang Kia-ngau was a supporter of reform in China and started his public service career in 1910 as editor-in- chief of the Official Gazette published by the Ministry of Communications. In 1913 he started his banking career assistant manager of the Bank of China in Shanghai. He distinguished himself just a few years later in 1916 when he refused a request by Yuan Shikai to stop redeeming banknotes for silver. The move was meant to secure silver deposits for Yuan's use, but would have undermined confidence in the new currency, so Chang disregarded the order and was instrumental in the bank's separation from the Peking government's control. By 1923, the Bank of China was almost exclusively owned by private, Shanghai-based shareholders, and during the next decade, it became the largest bank, by far, in Republican China. Under Chang's leadership, the Bank of China resisted the Kuomintang government's pressure to return to government control and to purchase government bonds which would contribute to ever-growing deficits. In 1928, T. V. Soong tried quite aggressively to assert control over the bank, but Chang and the directors resisted, so Soong created the Central Bank of China. Chang agreed to finance the new central bank's creation in exchange for a measure of independence and a charter to serve as the country's international exchange bank. Chang's interest was the development of the country, particularly railroad and other infrastructure development, even if such projects were not particularly profitable for the bank. In March 1935, H.H. Kung staged a coup against the Bank of China and Bank of Communications, forcing both to create new shares to allow the government to take a controlling share financed by overvalued government bonds. Chang Kia-ngau was removed as general manager of the Bank of China and was offered a lesser role within the Central Bank. He declined the offer, but in December 1935, accepted the position of Minister of Railways. During much of the Sino-Japanese War, Chang served as Minister of Communications, accompanying the central government from Nanking to Chungking. After mid-1943, he was in the U.S. frequently promoting aid to the Republic of China and at the negotiations of post-war arrangements, including aviation rights. He wrote a book on railroad development which was published in the U.S. at a time when interest in China was high. After the War, he was appointed Economic Commissioner for Manchuria, and his diaries from this period were also published in the U.S. After his departure from China, Chang moved to the US and was a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He died on October 13, 1979 in Palo Alto, California. His wife, Chang Pihya, died in Palo Alto on May 17, 1997.

During the next summer the organizers of the ferry company surveyed and laid out the town site for Omaha City west of the Missouri River. The first commercial building in Omaha belonged to the ferry company, which donated its services as the legislative chambers for the first territorial legislature and the first post office. Prior to the completion of the Omaha railroad bridge in April 1872 the Union Pacific railroad transfer boats carried the trains across to the Nebraska side. In the winter an ice bridge was constructed for the train to use. In 1862 Captain W. W. Marsh bought a large interest in the company and the next spring took charge of the business. The company ran a twenty-year charter which featured a variety of boats until 1872, when the Union Pacific railroad opened the first bridge across the Missouri River. That bridge made the ferry service obsolete at the end of the contract term after it was constructed in 1888. People associated with the ferry company included pioneers such as Dr. Enos Lowe, Jesse Lowe, Jesse Williams, and Joseph H. D. Street, all of whom resided in Kanesville, now known as Council Bluffs. The president of the incorporated company was Dr. Enos Lowe, and the other members were Sam S. Bayliss, Joseph H. D.

He is best known for founding and building WTVA, an NBC affiliate in Tupelo, Mississippi. In his later life, Spain also owned and operated other stations and a microwave service company. He was also a principal investor of MCI Southeast. Early life Spain was born in North Lewisburg, Ohio. He spent most of his youth in Tupelo. Even early in his life, Spain took great fascination with the way electronics worked. While still a high school student, he helped build and operate a local AM radio station, WELO. Spain also served as the chief engineer on a part-time basis. After graduating with honors from Mississippi State University at the age of 19, Spain took his electrical engineering degree and ventured to Washington, D.C. Career Shortly after being employed by NBC, Spain assisted in the construction of WNBW (now WRC-TV). He helped with the first live television feeds which originated from the Capitol, White House, and other various historic locations, including the 1949 presidential inauguration. In 1949, Spain joined the NBC Development Group in New York City to design television and microwave relay equipment. Spain explains the development group here in a 2000 interview: > \\"In those days, at least in the case of NBC and CBS, they had design and > development groups who were basically manufacturing their own cameras and > equipment and whatever. And then RCA and General Electric would take these > designs and modify them somewhat and sell them commercially. So, the > projects we were working on were very shortly thereafter [evolved into] > color television.\\" While there, he also helped build the first UHF television station in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and supervised the pattern measurements of the station's antenna. New standard With technology rapidly changing the scope of television in 1950, the decision was made by the Federal Communications Commission to adopt a color standard for all broadcast television networks. Spain participated in the 1949-1950 demonstration of the RCA-compatible color television system. Though the FCC initially dropped RCA's system, a rehearing was held two years later and RCA's all-electronic system was adopted. Two years later, Spain left NBC to take an engineering director position at WHEN- AM-FM-TV in Syracuse, New York. Origins of WTWV While working in Syracuse, Spain hoped to build a station in Tupelo. In December 1953, Spain successfully petitioned the FCC to allocate channel 9 to Tupelo, and was granted a construction permit three years later. The station first went on the air on March 18, 1957. The station's equipment--antenna, transmitter, cameras, etc.-- had been hand-built by Spain. Though many NBC executives believed Tupelo was not a desirable place for a local affiliate station because of its rural location, they told Spain that if he could figure out a way to obtain a network signal, he could carry it. After several under-the-table deals with WMC-TV in Memphis, Spain set up a network of microwave relays and repeater systems to carry the WMC-TV signal to Tupelo. WTWV became an official NBC affiliate sometime in the mid-1960s. WTWV changed its call letters to WTVA in 1979. Microwave Service Company In 1959, Spain started Microwave Service Company to provide distant signals to CATV systems and network interconnects for broadcast facilities. At the peak of his terrestrial transmission business, the company served twelve states. Because of the strategic location of these facilities, Spain joined Jack Goeken and Bill McGowan in the start-up of MCI. He maintained a sole ownership in MCI Mid-South and an equal partnership with the Meredith Corporation in MCI Southeast. Later years Spain began a fascination with antique cars after buying his first in 1974. Today, the Tupelo Automobile Museum houses all of Spain's 150-car collection. The museum, founded by Spain, opened in 2002 and was designated as the official state automobile museum in 2003. Spain was known internationally in broadcast circles and was awarded the Gold Circle Emmy Award in 2005 for 50 years' Lifetime Achievement in Broadcasting. Though his health declined after the turn of the millennium, Spain continued to visit WTVA almost daily until his death. Known to many of his employees as a true hands-on owner, Spain often bragged that he could \\"take the Channel 9 staff anywhere in the world and they would be second to none.\\" Of all the accomplishments Spain had overseen, WTVA was his crown jewel. Spain died at North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo on April 25, 2006 after a long battle with cancer. His family sold WTVA in 2015.

Some researchers associate the Piora Oscillation with the end of the Atlantic climate regime, and the start of the Sub-Boreal, in the Blytt–Sernander sequence of Holocene climates. The spatial extent of the change is unclear; it does not show up as a major, or even identifiable, event in hemispheric temperature reconstructions. First detection The phenomenon is named after the Val Piora or Piora Valley in Switzerland, where it was first detected; some of the most dramatic evidence of the Piora Oscillation comes from the region of the Alps.Lamb, pp. 124, 128, 143. Glaciers advanced in the Alps, apparently for the first time since the Holocene climatic optimum; the Alpine tree line dropped by 100 meters. In the Middle East, the surface of the Dead Sea rose nearly 100 meters (300 feet), then receded to a more usual level. A few commentators have associated the climate changes of this period with the end of the Uruk period, as a Dark Age associated with the floods of the Gilgamesh epic and Noah's flood of the Book of Genesis.Lamb, p. 128. Link to horse domestication The Piora Oscillation has also been linked to the domestication of the horse. In Central Asia, a colder climate favored the use of horses: \\"The horse, since it was so adept at foraging with snow on the ground, tended to replace cattle and sheep.\\"Matossian, p. 43. The Piora period seems associated with a period of colder drier air over the Western and Eastern Mediterranean, and may have depressed rainfalls as far afield as the Middle East. It is also associated with a sudden onset of drier weather in the central Sahara. Causes The cause or causes of the Piora Oscillation are debated. A Greenland ice core, GISP2, shows a sulfate spike and methane trough c. 3250 BCE, suggesting an unusual occurrence -- either a volcanic eruption or a meteor or an asteroid impact event. Other authorities associate the Piora Oscillation with other comparable events, like the 8.2 kiloyear event, that recur in climate history, as part of a larger 1500-year climate cycle.

The club currently competes in the Northern Football League. History From the 1890s, social football was played at Lew Curtis's Flat, Hurstbridge. In 1914, the Hurstbridge Football Club was founded and matches were played in the Bourke Evelyn Football League. Hurstbridge transferred to the Heidelberg District Football Association for just the one season in 1921 before returning to the Bourke-Evelyn Football League. The Club moved activities to the newly developed Memorial Park (now known as the Ben Frilay Oval) in 1922. In 1923, the Club joined the Diamond Valley Football League for the first time and their initial match was hosting Eltham Football Club. In 1924 the team purchased new jerseys and socks at the League's insistence that clubs wear uniform colours. In the early days Hurstbridge wore a Black guernsey with a yellow sash. Later, the club wore navy guernseys with a white HFC monogram. The club went into recess between 1925 and 1928, before rejoining the Diamond Valley Football League for the 1929 season. Hurstbridge joined the newly formed Panton Hill Football League in 1932. When this league went into recess in 1937 & 1938, Hurstbridge returned to the DVFL,only to return to the PHFL in 1939 where it remained until the league's demise at the end of the 1987 Season. Hurstbridge enjoyed considerable success in the PHFL winning seven premierships. In 1988 with the club rejoining the D.V.F.L changed its strip to its current blue and yellow guernseys to avoid clashes with existing clubs. In 2003 Hurstbridge broke a long drought winning the Second Division premiership defeating Lalor. Promotion to the highly competitive First Division in 2004 saw the Club failing to win a match and was relegated back to the Second Division for the 2005 Season where it has remained. After Thirteen Rounds of the 2009 Season, Division Two was split with the ninth to fourteenth clubs relegated to a new Third Division. Hurstbridge having finished tenth was placed into this new Grade and after five Rounds of Division Three finished Second and contested Finals and eventually played off in the inaugural 2009 Division Three Grand Final which Hurstbridge lost to Parkside 8.17.65 to 12.9.81 The 2010 Division Three Grand Final played on 4 September at Epping Oval against Parkside resulted in Hurstbridge's ninth premiership defeating Parkside 7.10.52 to 2.7.19 and promotion to Northern Football League Division Two in 2011.

It was the first single from Sharp's debut album, A Cheap and Evil Girl. After Trauma Records heard a demo of the song, they signed her to a record deal.Interview with Bree Sharp from June 10, 1999 Lyrics and meaning The song makes a direct reference to actor David Duchovny, who portrayed FBI special agent Fox Mulder on the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files, which revolves around special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Sharp commented in a 1999 interview with Rolling Stone that the song's message can be interpreted in a more expansive way: \\"[The] song is about David, but it's also about the way fantasy and reality can blur, and how giddy, hot, and excellent that can be.\\" Music video The X-Files set received a demo tape of the song and two of the show's assistants, Charles Forsch and Will Shivers, created a humorous video for the song for the set's Christmas party with permission from Sharp's label.Faster, Faster, She's the Star in This Disaster Movie, Off! Magazine, April 12, 2000 The video mixes clips of Duchovny with footage of X-Files crew members and numerous celebrities lip-syncing the lyrics, including series co-star Gillian Anderson, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Pamela Anderson, Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Jenna Elfman, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jane Leeves, Alex Trebek, KISS, and Jerry Springer. A complete list of participants is included in the credits at the end of the video. The video was never officially released, due to the money that would be needed for all the celebrities to sign off, but it became \\"a hot underground item\\". Upon seeing the video, Sharp said that \\"it was so exciting, and so shocking, and underground, and wonderful. I don't know what to say about it except that it was one of the thrills of my life to see the likes of Charles Nelson Reilly, and all four members of KISS, and Brad Pitt.\\" Release and acclaim After Sharp recorded the song, it eventually made its way to Duchovny, who expressed his appreciation for the track. Word began to spread, and soon, Sharp was approached by Trauma Records, who signed her for a record deal. After Forsch created the music video for the song, it became an underground hit. In an interview, Duchovny told Entertainment Weekly that he felt that \\"it's a really good song\\". He also admitted to playing it in his car \\"now and then\\". Ultimately, he jokingly gave it an \\"85\\", but noted that it was a \\"little embarrassing\\" because he \\"never expected it to be such a big deal.\\" Critically, the song received positive reviews. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the song and noted that \\"Sharp has a beautiful and distinctive voice, and 'David Duchovny' is an undeniably catchy confection.\\" Due to the success of the single, Sharp was invited to perform at Lilith Fair for several tour dates. Reference to this song was made during a March 2011 episode of the Showtime TV series Californication, \\"The Trial\\". David Duchovny's character Hank Moody, having uncharacteristically put on a suit and tie, is looking at himself in the mirror and complaining that he \\"looks like a fucking FBI agent\\".

RuBee utilizes Long Wave (LW) magnetic signals to send and receive short (128 byte) data packets in a local regional network. The protocol is similar to the IEEE 802 protocols in that RuBee is networked by using on-demand, peer-to-peer, active radiating transceivers. RuBee is different in that it uses a low frequency (131 kHz) carrier. One result is that RuBee is slow (1,200 baud) compared to other packet based network data standards (WiFi). 131 kHz as an operating frequency provides RuBee with the advantages of ultra low power consumption (battery life measured in many years), and normal operation near steel and/or water. These features make it easy to deploy sensors, controls, or even actuators and indicators. Because RuBee uses long wavelengths and works in the near field (under 50 feet) it is possible to simultaneously transmit and receive from many adjacent antennas, without interference providing the signals are synchronized. That makes it possible to enhance bandwidth and remove any angle sensitivity normally seen with other RF systems. RuBee has no reflections and is not blocked by steel or liquids and therefore is volumetric (not line-of-sight). That makes RuBee robust in harsh environment visibility and security applications. It also means RuBee has no TEMPEST target or eavesdropping risks in secure facilities. RuBee is the only wireless technology to ever be approved for use in secure facilities by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE). RuBee has also been approved by DoE and HERO tests by the DoD for use in high explosive areas with a Safe Separation Distance (SSD) of zero. RuBee is also only wireless technology to ever be approved by DoE with an intrinsic safety zero SSD. RuBee tags may be detected with high sensitivity through doors, even if the asset is hidden in steel brief case, as well as in vehicles though gates using antennas buried in a road. RuBee is often confused with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). It does not work like passive or active RFID, and has a protocol more in common with WiFi and Zigbee. All passive and active RFID protocols use what is known as backscattered transmission mode. Passive and active RFID tags act like a mirror, and work as reflective transponders. In contrast RuBee, similar to WiFi and Zigbee in that it is peer-to-peer, is a networked transceiver that actually transmits a data signal on demand, but is much slower (6-8 two way packets per second). The main difference between RuBee and WiFi or Zigbee is that RuBee works in the long wavelength band using the magnetic field, whereas WiFi, Bluetooth, Delta7, and Zigbee work in the VHF, UHF or SHF bands and with the electric field. The 1902.1 standard has been approved by the IEEE. RuBee received the Technology of the year award from Frost & Sullivan in 2007. The IEEE 1902.1 protocol details 1902.1 is the \\"physical layer\\" workgroup with 17 corporate members. The Workgroup was formed in late 2006. The final specification was issued as an IEEE standard in March 2009. The standard includes such things as packet encoding and addressing specifications. The protocol has already been in commercial use by several companies, in asset visibility systems and networks (see www.rubee.com). However, IEEE 1902.1 will be used in many sensor network applications, requiring this physical layer standard in order to establish interoperability between manufacturers. A second standard has been drafted 1902.2 for higher level data functions required in Visibility networks. Visibility networks provide the real-time status, pedigree and location of people, livestock, medical supplies or other high-value assets within a local network. The second standard will address the data-link layers based on existing uses of the RuBee protocol. This standard, which will be essential for the widespread use of RuBee in visibility application's, will support interoperability of RuBee tags, RuBee chips, RuBee network routers and other RuBee equipment at the data-link layer. RuBee tag details A typical RuBee radio tag, about 1.5 x .75 by 0.07 inches. It has a 4 bit CPU, 1 to 5 kB of sRAM, crystal, and lithium battery with expected life of five years., a clock. It could optionally have sensors, displays and buttons RuBee is bidirectional, on-demand, and peer-to-peer. It can operate at other frequencies (e.g. 450 kHz) but 131 kHz is optimal. RuBee tags can have sensors (temperature, humidity, jog), optional displays and may have a full 4 bit microprocessor with static memory. The RuBee protocol uses an IP Address (Internet Protocol Address). A tag may hold data in its own memory (instead or in addition to having data stored on a server). Some tags have as much as 5 kB of memory. RuBee functions successfully in harsh environments, with networks of many thousands of tags, and has a range of 1 to 30 m (3 to 100 ft) depending on the antenna configuration. By 'harsh environment' we mean situations in which one or both ends of the communication is near steel or water. RuBee radio tags function in environments where other radio tags and RFID may have problems. RuBee networks are in use in many visibility applications, including: exit entry detection in high security government facilities, weapons and small arms in high security armories, mission critical specialized tools, smart shelves and racks for high-value assets; smart entry/exit portals. How RuBee works IEEE 1902.1 RuBee uses magnetic waves also often called inductive communication. James Clerk Maxwell presented his now famous set of equations (Maxwell's Equations) to the Royal Society in 1864. These equations describe what happens when an electron travels along a conductive wire. Two fields are created, the Electric Field, labeled E, and the Magnetic Field, labeled H. These electric and magnetic fields travel through the aether, (i.e. outer space or the far field), at the speed of light with an assumed impedance of 377 Ω. E, the electric field, may be given in newtons per coulomb or volts per meter, and H, the magnetic field, may be given in gauss or amperes per meter. The two fields are tied together with the aether to form simple electric circuit capable of transferring power. However, when these two fields are measured in what is called the near field (much less than the wavelength of the signal) very strange things happen. (Also see Capps \\"Near Field or Far Field\\"). E and H are no longer connected in a simple predictable manner. The value of c (speed of light) and the resistance of the aether are altered and it is possible to produce large H values with low E values. It is as if the aether impedance has been reduced to only a few ohms. Virtually all of the energy radiated by a RuBee base station or a RuBee radio tag is contained in the magnetic field (H), not the electric (E) field. This stems from the fact that the RuBee antennas are short relative to the wavelength (about a mile and half or 2 km at 131 kHz), and RuBee operates in the near field. A typical emitted E from a RuBee base station is about 40-50 nanowatts, and H is about 900 milligauss (90 μT). Finally, RuBee is a packet based protocol in which only one end of the communication at a time generates fields, that is, a RuBee tag is a radiating transceiver. Environmental factors RF is based on physics, and can be reliably modeled with prediction tools and tuned models. RF is not always predictable because the active environment (people, steel shelves, floors, cabinets, doors) are all part of the same tuned circuit, and change with time. For example, a cell phone call to a phone in a building is modified by steel in the building. Reception may be improved by moving the phone near a window, or pointing the antenna in a particular direction. Radio waves are affected by just about everything around us. Many environmental factors influence performance. The more significant ones include steel and water, but people and electrical noise sources are also high on the list. Magnetic waves can pass through almost anything, even rock. That same rock blocks RF after only a few feet. An RF signal falls off as 1/r, whereas the strength of a magnetic wave falls off far faster at the rate of 1/r³. This means that the magnetic signal will not travel nearly as far as the RF signal. This rack likes to vibrate (resonate) at the RuBee frequency At first glance this difference in fall-off rate may appear as a negative for the range of a tag using magnetic signaling, but, as explained below, it turns out to be quite a plus in a local visibility network. Secondly, an unexpected advantage is that the noise RuBee sees is also magnetic, so it too falls off 1/r³. Noise and interference sources must be much more local to have significant strength, and tend to be easy to locate and minimize in an IEEE 1902.1 network. RuBee is 99.99% magnetic waves it therefore is not affected at all by people or animals, mud or water. Steel can alter performance, but steel can actually enhance a magnetic signal. A high frequency (over 1 MHz) RF antenna on or near a steel shelf has three problems: 1. The steel detunes the antenna; 2. RF nulls will appear on the shelf with no signal at all (Swiss cheese field) this is because steel blocks radio waves; and 3. Steel also reflects the radio waves (E in Maxwell's equations) contributing to communication errors and shelf nulls. In contrast Long Wavelength magnetic transmissions (below 1 MHz) is not blocked or reflected by steel so nulls do not occur. The loop antennas may be detuned by the steel, just like higher frequencies. But, unlike higher frequencies, magnetic loop antennas may be re- tuned with external capacitors, and, in many cases, circuits can be created that dynamically pick the optimal external capacitor for the antenna. Thus the de-tuning issue can vanish in a RuBee network. But the tuning has to be set to the right frequency by adjusting the capacitor to match the tuning curve with steel in place. Parasitic inductance and capacitance (see Self-resonant frequency) of the antenna wire and the shelf steel limit the range of tuned frequency of any antenna circuit. A simple loop of speaker wire about 100 ft (30 m) in diameter maybe tuned to resonate at 131 kHz with a simple external capacitor. A loop of only a 1-inch (25 mm) may be also tuned to resonate at 131 kHz. At 30 MHz, however, you might be able to tune the 1 inch (25 mm) antenna, but not the 100 ft (30 m) antenna, and not the shelf. At 30 MHz the largest tunable loop is about . RuBee's frequency is low on purpose so that it can nearly always re-tune to compensate for the parasitic inductance and capacitance despite use in harsh environments like steel shelves (see Roche et al. 2007). Back to the shelf example—the RuBee installation actually tunes the steel in the shelf, and the shelf itself becomes the antenna - the shelf becomes part of the resonate circuit and the H signal gets stronger near the shelf. For frequencies over 1 MHz it's not possible to incorporate most things you find in a warehouse, office building or factory as part of the antenna. RuBee works well in harsh environments because most steel items resonate well at the RuBee frequency of 131 kHz. As the frequency goes up over 1 MHz fewer steel items resonate. At a frequency of 10 MHz for example, nothing large made of steel can be tuned to resonance. How big can a RuBee loop antenna be? As the antennas get larger and larger noise becomes the gate keeper. A 100 ft (30 m) diameter loop can detect lightning storms hundreds of miles away. The biggest source of noise is deep space kilometric noise. While it is possible build a second antenna and do differential subtraction, a limit of a RuBee network is adequate for most practical visibility applications. RuBee antennas may also use ferrite rods with wire coils and get same range but without large loops. RuBee disadvantages and advantages The major disadvantage RuBee has over other protocols is speed and packet size. The RuBee protocol is limited to 1,200 baud in existing applications. The IEEE 1902.1 specifies 1,200 baud. The protocol could go to 9,600 baud with some loss of range. However, most visibility applications work well at 1,200 baud. Packet size is limited tens to hundreds of bytes. RuBee's design forgoes high bandwidth, high speed communication because most visibility applications do not require them. The use of LW magnetic energy brings about a number of advantages: * Long battery life – Because of the use of low frequencies and data rates the chips and detectors can run at low speed. Using (lowest cost) 4 micrometre CMOS chip technology, this leads to extremely low power consumption. LW magnetic wave tag systems can, and have, achieved 15-year lives using low-cost lithium batteries. This is also the expected battery shelf life. * Tag data travels with the asset – Because data is stored in the tag, IT (Information Technology) costs are reduced. This means that with a low-cost handheld reader one can read a RuBee tag and learn about the asset — manufacturing data, expiry date, lot number, etc. — without having to go to an IT system to look it up. In addition, the distance between the reader and the asset is not critical. RuBee can also write to a tag at the same range as it can read it. RFID, on the other hand, uses EEPROM memory, and writing to the tag is awkward. (In the case of RFID, range is limited, more power is required and write times are long.) * Human-safe – A RuBee base station produces only nanowatts of radio energy. RuBee's LW magnetic waves are not absorbed by biological tissues and are not even regulated by OSHA. In fact, RuBee produces less power and lower field strengths than the metal detectors in airports and the anti-theft detectors in retail stores operating at similar frequencies — by a factor of about 10 to 100. Recently published studies show that RuBee has no effect on pacemakers or other implantable devices (Hayes et al., 2007). * Intrinsically safe – A RuBee base station and tag produce a low level of magnetic energy not capable of heating explosives or creating a spark. In independent studies carried out by the Department of Energy RuBee was given a Safe Separation Distance (SSD) of zero, and is the only wireless technology to have that rating. That means tags and base stations can be placed directly on high explosives with no risk of accidental ignition or any heating. * High security and privacy RuBee tags have many unique advantages in high security applications. The eavesdropping range (the range at which a person with unlimited funds can listen to tag conversations) is the same as tag range. That means if someone is listening, they must be close enough for you to be able to see them. This is not true for RFID or 802 protocols. That means no one can secretly listen to tag/base station conversations. In addition, since RuBee tags have a battery, a crystal and sRAM memory, they can use strong encryption with nearly uncrackable one time keys, or totally uncrackable one time pads. RuBee is in use today in many high security applications for these reasons. RuBee is the only wireless technology approved for use in secure US government sites. * Controlled volumetric range – RuBee has a maximum volumetric range of approximately 10,000 square feet (900 m²), using volumetric loop antennas — From even a small volumetric antenna of 1 sq ft (900 cm²), RuBee can read a tag within an egg-shaped (ellipsoid) volume of about 10 x 10 x 15 ft (3 x 3 x 5 m). A special feature of IEEE P1902.1 known as Clip makes it possible to place many adjacent loop antennas in an antenna farm, and read from tens to hundreds of base-stations simultaneously. * Cost effective - With RuBee, relatively simple base stations and routers can be employed, which means receivers and card readers can be reasonably priced as compared to higher frequency transceivers. In addition, the tags often include a single chip, a battery, a crystal and an antenna, and can be priced competitively with respect to active RFID tags (those including a battery). * Less noise – Because ambient noise in a region falls off as 1/r³, RuBee exhibits reduced susceptibility to extraneous noise. The major limit to antenna size is deep space noise.  Unique RuBee application example: mission critical asset availability and security  Because RuBee is secure and magnetic it can provide real-time automated visibility, and the highest possible security of Mission Critical Assets—Mission Critical Assets (MCA) are assets that simply can not be lost or stolen, worth far more on the street or in hands of terrorists than the cost to replace. Visible Assets, Inc., Dasco Date, Inc., SMi Ltd, and Laser Device Inc. provide RuBee based automated MCA visibility and security using three important security layers: * Security Layer 1: Real-Time, Storage Physical Inventory. Assets in storage in a warehouse on racks, shelves or weapons in armory racks or other secure facility have RuBee wireless tags embedded or attached. RuBee enabled smart racks and smart shelves turn the steel in these racks into an antenna, and Visible software applications do daily or hourly audit trails of each item and report inventory and asset status. * Security Layer 2: Issuance Check Out/In. When an asset is removed from inventory, we know it has been removed from shelf, but ownership has to be transferred from a \\"storekeeper\\" to a new owner, a soldier or guard or asset guardian. This is done using ruggedized Apple iPads known as gRaps that have a RuBee embedded reader. Tags are read as the asset is passed across the check out counter. * Security Layer 3: Exit/Entry Detection. When the asset leaves the facility RuBee portal platforms provide identification detection and alarms using DoorGuard and GateGuard. Both detect RuBee enabled assets and IDs as a person passes through a door or gate, on foot or in a vehicle. These systems have passed many objective User Acceptance Tests (UAT) with 100% detection of assets even if hidden inside a steel case or vehicle. Three-Layer Security provides process free security for mission critical assets on racks with real-time inventory, on check in/out, and with sensitive exit entry detection of people and assets. Because RuBee is not blocked by people or by steel tags are read automatically without human assistance Security becomes far more reliant on human trust with loss of any layer. RuBee reduces that human trust reliance with full \\"process free\\" automation in all three layers. For example, if something is removed from inventory off the racks, but does not get checked out an alarm is issued. If an asset exits facility but is not checked out, an alarm is issued etc. RFID and barcode systems are blocked by steel and the human body. As a result, security is based on new human processes focused only on Layer 2. Both become human assisted asset tracking systems, not real-time automated security systems. Visible has repeatedly proven that RuBee is the wireless technology that can provide fully integrated, visibility with three security layer automation. Three-Layer RuBee Security compared to tracking technologies like bar codes and RFID. Bar codes and RFID become line-of-sight in harsh environments, blocked by people and by steel, and therefore require human assisted tag reads. In contrast RuBee visibility is not line-of-sight in harsh environments and provides process free security for mission critical assets because it is not blocked by steel or water RFID and barcode systems are blocked by steel and the human body. As a result, security is based on new human processes focused only on Security Layer 2. Both become human assisted asset tracking systems, not real-time automated security systems. Many in-use secure sites provide, process-free, fully automated, RuBee visibility with three-layer security.  Compare to NFC and Qi inductive power transfer  This protocol is similar at the physical level to NFC (13.56 MHz carrier, basically an air-core transformer pair) and also Qi's inductive energy transfer (100 kHz-300 kHz carrier). Both modulate the receiver's coil load to communicate to the sender. Some NFC tags can support simple processors and a handful of storage like this protocol. NFC also shares the physical security properties of \\"magnetic\\" communications like RuBee, however NFC signals can be detected miles from the source. RuBee signals are detectable at a maximum distance of from the source.

He has written extensively on New Zealand English, language style, and media language. He is a founding co-editor of the international quarterly Journal of Sociolinguistics and is known for his theory of audience design. Currently, he is working as the Director of the Institute of Culture, Discourse & Communication and is a Professor of Language & Communication at Auckland University of Technology.  Education and early career  Bell received a PhD scholarship from the University of Auckland in 1970. Seeing as how Bell had wanted to study linguistics but lacked the sufficient background to do so, the scholarship allowed him to have the sufficient amount of funding to study abroad to do the coursework for the field. Bell ended up going to London, England and began attending and auditing courses that were being taught by well-known London linguists, including Randolph Quirk, Ruth Kempson, Neil Smith, Dick Hudson, and Bill Downs. With Bill Labov serving as the external examiner for his PhD dissertation, Bell modeled his research in a similar manner that Labov had done by looking at the similarities and differences of different radio stations through varying social class audiences. Bell alluded in his dissertation that he applied VSLX methods to the study of newspaper language: \\"And I remember writing you know from New Zealand such a distant star in the Linguistic universe. Transformational grammar said, \\"you can't do this kind of work\\" you know studying news language to see how style works. You know there's no way to do this. It varies. We don't do \\"vary.\\" Well, I discovered that there were these people who had started to study variation and that made possible what I did.\\" Bell's dissertation took three radio stations in New Zealand, each one coming from the same studio, in order to tackle certain linguistic variables: consonant cluster simplification; the voicing of intervocalic t; negative contraction, auxiliary contraction, and specific determiner deletion. Through the use of VSLX techniques, Bell was able to uncover numerous difference amongst the radio stations. Bell led an audience survey, which uncovered that different sections and communities of the New Zealand population were being targeted in different manners by the radio stations. This led Bell to conclude that people will shift their styles based on who the audience they are targeting is. This idea led Bell to develop the theory of audience design, a theory that landed a prominent place within the field of sociolinguistics. While also doing work within the field of sociolinguistics, Bell has worked as a journalist and editor for several news outlets, including daily news services, weekly newspapers, and monthly magazines. Bell was an Honorary Research Fellow at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.  Journal of Sociolinguistics  Bell co-founded Journal of Sociolinguistics in 1996 with Nikolas Coupland. Having served as regular correspondents to each other's work since the mid-1980s, Bell and Coupland wanted to find a project or study that the two could work on together. The two decided to establish a new Sociolinguistics journal, especially during time when the field was beginning to grow and more publications were needed to be published: \\"But we had this idea that it would be nice to start a journal. We were both in awe of Language in Society and you know there were certainly other important journals around as well. But it simply occurred to me I think that there wasn't a journal called anything to do with Sociolinguistics and why not? And the [Sociolinguistics] Symposium was growing and there was lot of work around and we thought we could make it work. So, we approached Blackwell and they were utterly utterly wonderful from the very beginning. They saw the opportunity.\\" The journal was well supported by members of the Sociolinguistic community. Encompassing various areas of sociolinguistics, the journal sought to promote contributions that present thorough research in linguistic and social-scientific endeavors. Bell and Coupland served as co-editors until 2007, which was when Coupland retired and Bell became the primary editor. Publications= New Zealand Ways of Speaking English (1990)  Co-edited with Janet Holmes, Bell discusses the attitudes, variations, and changes that are associated with New Zealand English. Also offers a pragmatic analysis of New Zealand discourse.  The Language of News Media (1991)  Discussing what media language is and how importance the process of producing it is, Bell emphasizes throughout the publication that journalists and editors don't produce articles, but rather stories that have viewpoints and values that are meant to be analyzed. Bell also stresses his concerns on how audiences can influence media language styles and reconfigure the news that comes along with it.  Approaches to Media Discourse (1998)  Co-edited with Peter Garrett, Bell covers the approaches that are most prominent within media discourse: * Opinions and ideologies in the press * Structure of stories in the news * Television news discourse * Political and economic news discourse * Front page discourse  Languages of New Zealand (2006)  Co-edited with Ray Harlow and Donna Starks, Bell looks at New Zealand English, a more recent variety of English that younger New Zealanders have started to claim as part of their identities. Bell, Harlow, and Starks distinguish the use of New Zealand English through the \\"use of Maori words such as kia ora (hello) and grammatical features such as 'at the weekend'.\\"  The Guidebook to Sociolinguistics(2013)  Serving as a comprehensive oversight to the field, Bell takes a gives an overview of the main terms and concepts of Sociolinguistics. He also discusses the goals and methods that come along with the field. Bell discusses the numerous areas that are associated with the study: * Multilingualism * Language shift and maintenance * Language birth, death, and in time * Variation in language and situated language * Language theories and engagement See also *Sociolinguistics *Audience Design References *Bell, A. & Koenraad Kuiper.

His short stories about American Indian life were the first to attempt to accurately portray the Plains Indians and among the first attempts at realism by an American writer. Snelling's short story collections were among the earliest in the United States. Snelling was born and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. He moved to the American frontier in Minnesota and, from his late teens to his mid-20s, traded with the American Indians and explored the area. He lived with the Dakota Indians for a time and learned their language and customs. In 1828, Snelling returned to Boston and began a writing career. He wrote for New England periodicals and earned friends and enemies with his opinion pieces on American society. Over the next 20 years, he tackled subjects such as American writing, gambling, and prison conditions. Early life and career William Joseph Snelling was born on December 26, 1804, in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, Josiah Snelling, was an officer in the army, and his mother was Elizabeth Bell. His mother died when he was six years old, and Snelling moved outside Boston to live with relatives and attend school. At age 14, Snelling entered West Point.Reichardt 336. Two years later, Snelling left school and gradually moved west. He lived with the Dakota tribe of American Indians for a winter. In 1821, Snelling reached his father's military post at Fort St. Anthony (later Fort Snelling) in Minnesota. William Joseph Snelling stayed there for five years, trading in furs and exploring the surroundings. During his time with the Dakota, he had learned their language and customs, and he worked as an interpreter between the Indian Agency and the Indians. For example, he helped negotiate the resolution of hostilities between the Dakota and the Chippewa and Winnebago tribes. In 1826, Snelling married Dionice Fournier, a Frenchwoman. She died a year later. Josiah Snelling died in 1828, and William Joseph Snelling moved on. Writing career Snelling returned to Boston and entered the writing field. Over the next 20 years, he wrote pieces for American Monthly, Boston Book, the Boston Herald, the New England Galaxy, New England Magazine, North American Review, and Token. Snelling expressed frank opinions on American society and proposed social reforms, earning him both praise and enmity.Reichardt 336–7. Truth: A New Year's Gift for Scribblers is an early example. The piece, written in 1831, satirizes American letters. As editor of the New England Galaxy, Snelling initiated an anti- gambling movement among Boston's newspapers. He was sued for libel and fought back by publishing his editorials in pamphlet form, called \\"Exposé of the Vice of Gaming\\", in 1833. He used the proceeds to pay his legal costs. He later served four months in jail for drunkenness. The experience led him in 1837 to take on prison reform with his The Rat-Trap; or Cogitations of a Convict in the House of Correction.Reichardt 337. Snelling earned his greatest fame as a writer of short stories about his experiences on the American frontier. He realized that the lifestyle of the Plains Indians was under threat, and he deemed the popular characterization of Indians in American literature to be stereotyped and inaccurate. He thus tried for realism in his stories, making him one of the earliest American writers to do so. Modern ethnographers still recognize his works as the first accurate literary portrayal of the lifestyle of the Plains Indians. In \\"The Last of the Iron Hearts\\", Snelling wrote, \\"[We] beg leave to assure our readers, that the Indian is not the ferocious brute of Hubbard and Mather, or the brilliant, romantic, half-French, half-Celtic Mohegan and Yemassee created by Symmes and Cooper.\\"Quoted in Reichardt 337. He further claimed that one \\"must live, emphatically, live, with Indians; share with them their lodges, their food, and their blankets, for years, before he can comprehend their ideas, or enter into their feelings.\\"Preface to Tales, quoted in Reichardt 337. Snelling's tales met with critical acclaim, and modern critics praise them. In 1923, Fred Lewis Pattee wrote that \\"his Indian stories are undoubtedly the best written during the early period [of American literature]\\"Development of the American Short Story, quoted in Reichardt 337. Contemporary biographer Mary R. Reichardt credits Snelling with \\"creating . . . engaging and vigorous tales based on Native-American life and legend as well as stories of the cultural conflict resulting from the early white settlements on the frontier\\", although the stories \\"lapse at times into sentimentality and didacticism.\\" In 1830, Snelling published a compilation of ten of his frontier stories as Tales of the Northwest; or, Sketches of Indian Life and Character; this is one of the earliest short story collections published in the United States. Snelling also wrote poetry about his experiences. He wrote children's stories of adventure and travel under the pseudonym Solomon Bell. Snelling died on December 24, 1848.

After over 130 years, Fossati's is still owned and operated by the same family. Fossati had the current building constructed in 1895 and moved the deli from a nearby downtown location (actually, Fossati's had changed locations several times, and had, at one time or another, been on every corner of the square in downtown Victoria). The current building features double front doors with multi-light transoms. Over the years, Fossati's has handled imported foods, groceries, and feed and has served as an important gathering place for Victoria's citizens. In addition, many famous musicians have played at the deli, including country music legend Willie Nelson. The deli is often used for political functions as well. Most recently, Texas Governor Rick Perry held a campaign stop in Victoria on August 25, 2010. In the back room of the deli, known as the Frank Napoleon room, there is a giant bookcase filled with hundreds of cookbooks, many of which have been out of print for 50+ years. Also inside, there is a trench-like area just above the floor surrounding the bar. This is where men used to spit tobacco.

It is primarily concerned with Aboriginal welfare issues and the preservation of Aboriginal culture and heritage, and is based in Melbourne.  History  The League was established in 1957 as a response to an enquiry by retired magistrate, Charles McLean, into the circumstances of Aboriginal Victorians. McLean was critical of conditions in the Lake Tyers and Framlingham Aboriginal Reserves. McLean recommended that persons of mixed Aboriginal and European descent be removed from the reserves. The people of Lake Tyers objected to this, and the League was formed out of their campaign.Aboriginal Advancement League (ATNS) The new League drew from two already existing organisations, the Australian Aborigines League, established 1934Australian Aborigines League – Institution – Reason in Revolt:Australian Aborigines League (1934- ) and the Save the Aborigines Committee, which had been established in 1955 as a response to the Warburton Ranges crisis. Founding President of the League was Gordon Bryant, with Doris Blackburn as Deputy President, Stan Davey as Secretary and Douglas Nicholls as Field Officer. An umbrella national organisation, the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement when founded in February 1958 in Adelaide, South Australia, but the Aborigines Advancement League of South Australia (AALSA) finally disaffiliated in 1966, because it thought the federal organisation was too centred on Victoria. Early activities included lobbying for a referendum to change the Australian constitution to allow the Federal government to legislate on Aboriginal affairs, and an establishing a legal defence fund for Albert Namatjira, after he was charged with supplying liquor to an Aboriginal ward. By 1967 it had moved to being fully controlled by Aboriginal people with Bill Onus as the first Aboriginal President.Onus, William Townsend (Bill) (1906–1968) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online From 1975 to 1983, a salaried director of the Aboriginal Advancement League was Elizabeth Maud Hoffman becoming the organizations longest serving director.

He was a prolific and highly regarded composer at the time, but little of his work survives, almost all having been destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake and fire of 1755. Life Ghersem was born in Tournai, and received his boyhood musical training there, possibly under the direction of composer George de La Hèle. While still young, \\"between the ages of 7 and 12\\" according to the Habsburg chapel records, he was one of 14 boys brought to Spain to sing in the imperial chapel choir, the capilla flamenca. During this period, as during the previous two hundred years, the Low Countries provided a dependable source of talented young musicians for the choirs of kings and aristocrats in other parts of Europe. This practice was shortly to come to an end, as the last known group of choirboys from Flanders went to Spain in 1594. After coming to Spain, Ghersem may have worked again with La Hèle briefly, since he directed the choir in Madrid, but La Hèle died in 1586. Ghersem rose in the ranks in the chapel, becoming cantor in 1593 and assistant director in 1598. In the 1590s he worked with prolific composer Philippe Rogier, who was then the director of the chapel choir; before Rogier died young in 1596 (he was 35) he had asked Ghersem to assist in publication of a group of masses he wrote; Ghersem added one of his own to this collection, which was fortunate, since that is the only work of Ghersem which survives complete. In 1604, Ghersem left Spain and returned home, perhaps seeking a position as a music director, a position which was denied him in Madrid. In Brussels he found such employment in the chapel of Albert and Isabella, a position he kept for the rest of his career. He also became chaplain of the oratory, also in Brussels, and became a priest. During this time the court in Brussels was one of the leading artistic centers in Europe; this was the beginning of the \\"Golden Age\\" in the southern Netherlands. Some of his distinguished musical colleagues in Brussels in the early 17th century included Peter Phillips and John Bull. Ghersem died in Tournai, the place of his birth.Grove online, Ghersem Music and influence Ghersem seems to have written most of his music in Spain, and he wrote quite a lot. The catalogue of the library of John IV of Portugal, which listed only about a third of the contents of that colossal collection, one of the largest libraries of the age, gives well over 200 works, all of which were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake and fire of 1755. Ghersem's sacred vocal music included masses, motets, settings of the Lamentations, Magnificats, psalms, and 170 villancicos; he also wrote some secular music which John archived there, including chansons in French and a few songs in Spanish. Some of the villancicos were antiphonal compositions for Christmas, which had exchanges between voices and groups of instruments.Grove online, \\"Villancico\\" Not enough is known of his music to determine if he adopted the Baroque style, the seconda pratica, for any of this work. Also no music for instruments only is known from the catalogue. His solitary surviving complete work is a mass for seven voices, in the polyphonic style of the Renaissance. It makes use of canon, and is based on a motet by Francisco Guerrero. Ghersem's music was loved by both Philips of Spain as well as John IV of Portugal, and Italian music theorist and writer Pietro Cerone praised him effusively in his massive and chaotic work El melopeo y maestro of 1613.

Conflent went through a Visigothic and then a Moorish phase before it was reconstituted as a county by the Franks. It was initially attached to the County of Razès and the Barcelona. Conflent was one of the last Catalan counties to see widespread grants of aprisiones, which were not commonplace until the 890s.Lewis, 72 and n20. Serfdom, though less common there than elsewhere, existed in Conflent in the late ninth century.Lewis, 170. Until 870 Conflent was also attached to the counties of Urgell and Cerdanya, but in that year Charles the Bald granted it to Miro the Elder, who already governed the Capcir and Fenouilledès. Under Miro's governance the monastery of Sant Andreu d'Eixalada (which was destroyed in a storm in 878) was replaced by the new foundation of Sant Miquel de Cuixà. When Miro died Conflent passed to his brother Wilfred the Hairy. Under Wilfred's heirs the nominal authority of the Carolingian monarch was disregarded and Conflent was ruled as a family possession. Already in the reign of Charles the Bald much of the royal fisc in Conflent had been granted away.Lewis, 161-162. Throughout the tenth and eleventh centuries, Conflent was attached to Cerdagne, which was almost always more prominent. In the mid-tenth century Conflent experienced a period of encastellation. Two castles, Castellano and Turres Betses, appear by the 950s; castles were more common in the Spanish and Gothic marches as one approached the border with the Moors:Lewis, 229. Conflent therefore lay somewhere in the middle in terms of density of fortifications. Under Wilfred II, however, it achieved prominence over Cerdagne when he built a palace at Corneilla-de-Conflent and resided there frequently. He also founded the new monastery of San Martín de Canigó (1000), to which he retired in 1035. About 1089 count William Raymond transferred the capital from Cornellá de Conflent to Vilafranca de Conflent, which he had founded. When the line of the counts of Cerdanya and Conflent died out in 1117, and the counties were inherited by Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona, the county of Conflent was quick to disappear from the administrative language. In 1118 Raymond Berengar \\"by the counsel and directive of the magnates and the knights of the whole county of Cerdanya and Conflent\\" and jointly with the bishop of Elne established a peace in Conflent and Cerdanya.Bisson, Mediterranean Territorial Power, 144. He also stabilised the coinage of Conflent (for a tax) and took an oath of fealty from the castellans.Bisson, Celebration and Persuasion, 185-186. By 1126 Conflent was a vegueria within the county of Cerdanya or, more usually, Roussillon. Capcir was a sotsvegueria (major subdivision) of the vegueria of Conflent. Conflent remained as a recognisable feudal unit as late as c.1200, when it was one of three counties (along with Cerdanya and Roussillon) whose charters were gathered together in the great cartulary called the Liber feudorum Ceritaniae.

Bioactivity  dFBr has been identified as a novel positive allosteric modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with sub- type specificity for heteromeric receptor with no effect on homomeric sub- type. A recent study has been published which describes the synthesis of water-soluble salts of dFBr and its action has been confirmed as selective potentiator of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor responses by using two- electrode voltage clamp whole cell recordings. In the year 2002 it was reported that dFBr was cytotoxic on human colon cancer cell line HCT 116. Desformylflustrabromine has also been found to be a positive allosteric modulator for the α2β2 subtype of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Additionally it relieves the inhibition of both α2β2 and α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by β-Amyloid (1–42) Peptide. Thus desformylflustrabromine can potentially be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Many of the analogues and derivatives of dFBr are reported to have a potentiating effect on the α4β2 receptors. Modulation of nicotonic acetylcholine receptor function by desformylflustrabromine has also been found to produce analgesic and anti-allodynic effects in animal models, which could potentially make it of interest for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anti-addictive and pro-cognitive actions have also been demonstrated. Furthermore, limited experimental data suggests a potential use in treating the compulsive behaviors seen in OCD.

It is commonly called an axe-knife, because the blade is fixed onto an axe-like haft. The weapon takes its name from the city of Bhuj in the Kachchh district of the state of Gujarat, where it originated, though it may have also originated in Sindh. The Bhuj is short, broad, stout, and heavy, with a mild curve. It often sports an engraved and gilded mount, inlaid haft and decorated knob. This knob is typically a stylized elephant head, giving the weapon the nickname elephant knife. The short re-curved blade measures 7-10 inches long, and its copper sheath makes the weapon 20 inches long in total. It is mostly single-edged, except for a slight rear edge at the tip. The blade is mounted at a right angle to a metal haft in a manner similar to a long axe. The haft is sometimes hollow, concealing another small stiletto-like dagger. The weapon is similar to the Punjabi Gandasa or the European Glaive. The Weapon was popular among the Sindhi cavalry of the Soomra and Samma Dynasties of Sindh.

Plot The movie revolved around a Chinese flatbread restaurant in Hong Kong, where the Mo family worked and make a living. Luk Siu-fung (Lydia Shum) is the matriarch of the family, protecting them against all external threats from local gangsters, while also serving the family's every need. However, Siu-fung suffers from heart problems, and on the eve of her wedding anniversary with her longtime husband, Mo Chak-shu, Siu-fung died. Before Siu-fung died, she expressed a desire to ride a Chinese Wedding Sedan in the afterlife, which Chak-shu and his son, Sonny, promises. When Siu-fung reaches the underworld, the wedding sedan arrived just in time to carry Siu-fung over the Neihe Bridge, where she will officially reach the underworld and be prepared for reincarnation. After proper registrations, Siu-fung (who is grossly overweight) attempted to cross the Neihe Bridge with the sedan, and the excessive weight caused the bridge to collapse. The sedan carriers, along with the sedan, fell to their death into the Neihe River, while Siu-fung was saved by the Spiritworld Keeper at the last moment. Since the Neihe Bridge was destroyed, Siu-fung cannot cross the bridge, thus creating an anomaly where Siu-fung is not officially dead, in spiritworld terms. The spiritworld keeper attempted to guide Siu-fung back to human life, where she can reenter her body, and be returned to life. However, Siu-fung was a little late, and her husband and son pressed a button to cremate Siu-fung's body.

Meanwhile, Mo Tak-ko (武德高) is phonetically similar to \\"無得高\\", which means \\"will never grow tall\\". Paul Chun's character, Kam Tai-tse (金大枝) somewhat resembles the transliterated name of the former President of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung. Mo Tak-ko's purported English name, Charles (as revealed to Diana), is a reference to Charles, Prince of Wales, while Diana's name is a reference to Diana, Princess of Wales.

The division spent the period from its formation to early 1917 mainly involved in positional warfare in Upper Alsace, after which it occupied the trenchlines near Verdun. It remained in positional warfare in this general region until the end of the war. It participated in no major battles, but was primarily suited to quieter sectors of the line.

Biography Hardenbergh was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey on May 18, 1830. He attended Rutgers College in 1844. He took up residence in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1846 and was employed in a banking house in New York City. He was a clerk in the Hudson County National Bank in 1852. He served as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly in 1853 and 1854.

Hoffmann's version of the European legend of The Sandman. Plot summary Late on a moonlit evening, a young boy is sent up to bed by his mother. He walks through the darkened hallway of his house and ascends the long, narrow flights of stairs alone, becoming increasingly paranoid that something is following him, until he reaches the safety of his bedroom. As he's drifting off to sleep, he sees a face appear in the crescent Moon outside his window. At the bottom of the stairs, a monstrous, bird-like man appears. It begins to clamber upstairs, slamming doors and creaking floorboards all the way to let the boy know of its impending presence. Frightened, the boy accidentally knocks over his oil lamp—alerting the monster to exactly what room he's in. The boy hides under the covers, as a figure opens the door and approaches his bed. It's revealed to be his mother, who retrieves the broken lamp and tucks him in for the night. As he falls asleep, feeling safe once more, the monster appears in his room and begins to make noise, trying to rouse him. When the boy finally opens his eyes, the monster blows sand in them and snatches something from him before departing through the bedroom window. The monster returns to its nest on the Moon, where its hungry children are waiting. it reveals the boy's eyes, which it plucked out, and feeds to them to its young. The boy, now blind, walks helplessly among a crowd of children who've been victimized.

Tibetan incense is made in Tibet, Northern parts of Nepal, and Bhutan. Incense is an important representation of the Tibetan culture. These incenses have a characteristic \\"earthy\\" or herbal scent to them. Tibetan incenses can contain 30 or more ingredients. As with most Asian incense, Tibetan incense is not rolled around a bamboo stick, but is extruded into lengths or coils. Medicine In Tibetan medicine, incense is regarded as a way of treatment for various ailments. This information can be found in Tibetan medical books which originated from the four Tantras (Root Tantra, Tantra of Enlightenment, Tantra of Instructions, Concluding Tantra) which is also known as rGyudbzhi in Tibetan. It is the central work upon which contemporary Tibetan medicine is based. Tibetan medical theory states that everything in the universe is made up of the 5 proto-elements: sa (earth), chu (water), me (fire), rLung (wind or air), and Nam-mkha (space). But only four play a role in the classification of our illnesses, except Nam-mkha. Each element contains eight active forces and 17 qualities. Some of these elements are contained in our three bodily energies and their imbalance affects the equilibrium of the three 'fluids' (rLung, mkhrispa and badkan). Production Authentic Tibetan incense originates either from traditional monastery or medical college/hospital formulation, so Tibetan incense follows a particular lineage which can be traced back to the originator. Over the years, Tibetan incense making have been polluted and over commercialized which leads to incense formulation by non-authentic makers. This has affected and degenerated the Tibetan incense formulation and making methods to a certain degree, which forms an important part of the unique Tibetan Culture. But there are still some in parts of Nepal and Bhutan that produce Tibetan incense in an authentic manner, by using authentic Himalayan herbs and ingredients.

It is located off State Route 77 just south of the town of Waldo, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southeast of Talladega. Coordinates are (33.379106, -86.028853). Built in 1858, the 115-foot (35 m) bridge is a combination of Howe truss and Queen-post truss construction over a single span. Its WGCB number is 01-61-02. The Waldo Covered Bridge is currently eligible for addition to the National Register of Historic Places. It is the second oldest surviving covered bridge in the state, although it is also the only one not being maintained. History The Waldo Covered Bridge was built on an old Socopatoy Indian trail behind Riddle's Mill, a grist mill which was later converted into the Waldo Town Hall and then a restaurant. Nearby is the Riddle's Hole gold mine, which operated from 1840 through World War II. The bridge was used as an access route in April 1865 by Wilson's Raiders during the American Civil War, a cavalry group led by Union Army General James H. Wilson. The bridge was open to traffic in later years, possibly for mine access during its operation, but condemned by the state in the 1960s and the approaches removed as overall maintenance remained minimal. Even though there was extensive restoration work done to the Waldo Covered Bridge in recent years as part of establishing a recreational park, the project was soon scrapped. As a result, the structure was left to sit on its two stone piers \\"as is.\\" The Waldo Covered Bridge is currently inaccessible to the public but people can walk the grounds with permission from the Old Mill Restaurant. There were plans by the owners to once again restore the bridge, but time and money have been major issues. The restaurant closed and the property went up for sale. The restaurant is now open under new ownership. See also *List of Alabama covered bridges References * Dale J. Travis Covered Bridges. Waldo CB: Credits.

Life and work  Li Ziming was born in Lijia Village, Ji County in Hebei province on June 25, 1902, and died on January 23, 1993, at the age of 90. He had a very cultured upbringing including the study of literature and martial arts, and was very talented at calligraphy and painting. In 1921, he became a disciple of the second generation Baguazhang master, Liang Zhenpu, and a friend of his father. He began an intensive study of Baguazhang. Liang passed down the art of Baguazhang through the oral tradition. He practised every day until he achieved a very deep understanding of the fighting secrets of Baguazhang. After extensive training with Liang, Li entered the Hebei province Martial Arts Academy and trained in martial arts under the famous masters Zhang Zhankui, Shang Yunxiang and Ju Qingyuan. He later returned to Beijing, where he often exchanged techniques and sparred with martial arts brothers Guo Gumin, Li Shaoan and Zeng Xingsan, as well as many other famous martial arts masters. Li reached a very high level of technical proficiency and attainment in all aspects of Baguazhang including forms, weapons, theory and fighting methods. He was especially skilled at the art of fighting and his hand-to-hand combat skills increased perceptibly over the years. Li dedicated his life to the preservation of Baguazhang forms, the research of Baguazhang theory and the popularization of the art. In 1979, in order to protect Dong Haichuan's tomb, he suggested to move it to Wanan Public Cemetery from the old location; on August 2 and 3, 1980, a group of over 100 Beijing Baguazhang practitioners under his leadership moved Dong's remains as well as accompanying stone tablets to the new location in Wanan Public Cemetery. Chinafrominside.com website Li Ziming was conscientious and meticulous with all things relating to Baguazhang. He was not given to flattery, and followed a strong code of morals and righteousness. He was well known for being generous, kind, modest, amiable, charitable, and benevolent to others. He was very patient when teaching his students, while never holding anything back from them. Li Ziming conducted extensive research about the applications of other styles of Baguazhang, and took the best elements from each style.

Chita was the headquarters of the district. It was finally disbanded on December 1, 1998 by being amalgamated with the Siberian Military District, though Chita remained the headquarters of the new amalgamated district.  History = Formation and World War II  The district was formed in response to the Japanese invasion of China and military escalation in the region. The armies and corps of the district took part in the battle of Khalkhin Gol under General Georgy Zhukov. In June 1940 the 16th Army was formed in the District before being transferred to the west. On June 22, 1941, the District comprised the 17th Army, Air and Air Defence commands, 12th Rifle Corps (65th and 94th Rifle Divisions), 93rd Rifle Division, the Transbaikal Fortified Region, two gun artillery regiments, a howitzer artillery regiment, and smaller units.Orbat.com/Niehorster, Transbaikal Military District June 22, 1941 The Transbaikal Military District became the Transbaikal Front; a front formed on September 15, 1941 in order to prevent a possible attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army. Against the general trend of Soviet tank divisions being disbanded in the first few months of the German invasion during the Second World War, due to heavy losses, the 57th and 61st Tank Divisions were active in the District in 1941.See Michael Holm, 13th Motor Rifle Division, 2015, for 61 TD  Cold War  On 30 September 1945 the Transbaikal Front was disbanded and reorganized as the Transbaikal-Amur Military District, following the success of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. On 10 July 1947, Headquarters Transbaikal-Amur Military District was amalgamated with HQ 36th Army to become the Transbaikal Military District (second formation). In 1955 the 61st Tank Division became the 13th Tank Division, then two years later the 13th Motor Rifle Division (Ulan Ude), but was then disbanded in 1957. The 6th Guards Tank Army was stationed in Mongolia for fifteen years after the end of the war, reporting to the Transbaikal Military District. The then friendship with China and the Khrushchev reductions in the Soviet Ground Forces' strength meant the 6th Guards Tank Army was relocated to the Kiev Military District. Perhaps as a consequence, the 9th Guards Motor Rifle Division was disestablished. In the late 1960s the situation on the Sino-Soviet border became more tense and many new units were sent to Siberia, or formed there, such as the 29th Army. Among these formations was the 11th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which was transferred from Smolensk to Bezrechnaya in May 1968. Thanks to this buildup, Chita became one of the developed cities in Eastern Siberia. In 1988 the District included the 29th Army at Ulan-Ude (5th Guards Tank Division, 52nd, 91st and 245th Motor Rifle Divisions), the 36th Army at Borzya (11th Guards, 38th Guards, and 122nd Guards Motor Rifle Divisions), the 212th Guards District Training Centre at Chita (just renamed from the 49th Tank Training Division), the 150th Training Motor Rifle Division, and the 39th Army, controlling Soviet troops in Mongolia, which had its headquarters at Ulan-Bator and included the 2nd Guards Tank Division, 51st Tank Division, and 12th, 41st, and 91st Motor Rifle Divisions.

Origins In January 1997, Mayor Pierre Bourque tried to dismiss two members of Montreal's Executive Committee: Deputy Chairman Sammy Forcillo and Pierre Goyer. Yet, the city charter of 1921 clearly states that appointments to the Executive Committee are irrevocable. Forcillo and Goyer left Vision Montreal (Bourque's party) to sit as independents, but exercised their right to stay on the committee. Therefore, management by consensus became nearly impossible to reach for the remainder of Bourque's term. Commission permanente de l'aménagement du territoire - Auditions et étude détaillée du projet de loi n° 216, Assemblée nationale du Québec, June 4, 1997 That incident as well as allegations of authoritarian tendencies led thirteen other Vision Montreal councillors to leave the party and sit as independents with their colleagues of the opposition. Consequences By August 1997, only a minority of the council members (24 out of 51) were members of Vision Montreal and the credibility of the Bourque administration was undermined.

Much of what is today considered angolanidade was created by Angolan intellectuals as a conscious effort to highlight an idealized vision for what it means to be Angolan.  History  Angolanidade began to develop in the 1940s and '50s, when black Angolans started to differentiate themselves from white settlers by embracing and reclaiming aspects of traditional African culture. Angolanidade adopted some aspects of négritude, a cultural ideology developed by francophone African intellectuals that emphasized the distinctness of African cultural output. The ideas espoused by the négritude movement were adapted to Angolan culture by Angolan intellectuals, such as the poet Viriato da Cruz. Da Cruz codified the concept of angolanidade in 1948 as a literary movement with the slogan \\"Let's Discover Angola!,\\" supported by publication of the journal \\"A Mensagem.\\" Writers within the movement, including Agostinho Neto, later to be Angola's first president, identified and highlighted the vibrant culture of Angolan musseques, or shantytowns, as a direct counterpoint to the colonial government's perspective that such places were squalid and full of crime. Though the literary movement had largely declined by the 1960s, its cultural influence remained. By the time of the Angolan War of Independence, from 1961-1974, embracing angolanidade and declaring cultural autonomy became a way of pushing back against the oppression of colonialism.  Cultural aspects  Writing, dance, music, and fashion are major aspects of how angolanidade is created, perpetuated, and expressed. Especially in the capital of Luanda, which was historically associated with white colonial settlers, black Angolans were encouraged to wear traditional dress as a form of cultural distinction and to build a sense of nationalism among the people. Opting to wear traditional clothing also indicated a refusal to assimilate and therefore lose one's culture in the face of colonialism.  Music and dance  Music and dance are central to the expression of angolanidade. Historian Marissa Moorman argues that it is \\"in and through popular urban music, produced overwhelmingly in Luanda's musseques, that Angolan men and women forged the nation.\\" Angolan music began to be explicitly political in the 1950s, drawing from and supporting the budding Angolan liberation movements that were starting to take root. A number of members of Angolan bands were members of the MPLA, and their political experiences informed their music, which in turn influenced the politics of their audiences. In choosing to use local instruments and national languages - primarily Kimbundu and Umbundu - in their music, Angolan musicians rejected assimilation and reinforced the concept of angolanidade.

It was part of Spain's effort to colonize the region of Spanish Florida and convert the Timucua to Catholicism. It served the Ibi people, also known as the Yui or Ibihica, a Timucua group of the area. History Mission San Lorenzo was established at the main village of the Ibi, Ibihica. It was located in the Georgia interior 14 leagues (about 50 miles) from Mission San Pedro de Mocama on Cumberland Island.Milanich 1999, p. 50. It probably stood east of the Okefenokee Swamp, near the Charlton-Camden county line, just north of the present border between Georgia and Florida and between St. Marys and Satilla Rivers. Spanish missionary efforts among the Ibi began with the visit of the Franciscan Fray Pedro Ruíz in 1597. Ruíz had some success in converting the people and managed to secure the submission of the chief to Spanish authority, but he had to be recalled later that year due to the Guale Rebellion. The Ibi thus had no friar of their own, but were visited regularly by friars from Missions San Pedro de Mocama and San Juan del Puerto.Worth vol. I, p. 54. After 1616 San Lorenzo de Ibihica was established to give the Ibi their own mission.Worth vol. I, pp. 74–75. It continued to operate until 1656, when the mission and town were evidently destroyed by the Spanish as a result of the Timucua Rebellion.Worth vol. I, p. 74.Worth vol. II, p. 117.

Career=Amateur Rogers pitched for Georgia Southern University and in 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Detroit Tigers He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 11th round of the 2003 MLB Draft. Detroit assigned him to the Low-A Oneonta Tigers in the New York–Penn League, where he went 3–2 with a 3.34 ERA in twelve starts. In 2004 Detroit promoted Rogers to the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps, where he went 6–8 with a 4.55 ERA. Lack of run support contributed to several losses: at one point in April, Rogers was 0–1 despite three consecutive quality starts and a 2.38 ERA. For 2005, Detroit converted Rogers into a relief pitcher and promoted him to the High-A Lakeland Tigers, where he posted a 2.06 ERA in 52 appearances. Rogers and fellow middle-reliever Danny Zell were cited by manager Mel Rojas as integral to Lakeland's success that year, while pitching coach Britt Burns called Rogers \\"the most improved pitcher on this staff.\\" Detroit promoted Rogers to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves where he continued to work as a reliever, compiling a 3–2 record with an ERA of 2.39 by the end of July, when the Tigers traded him to the Pittsburgh Pirates for first basemen Sean Casey. Pittsburgh Pirates Rogers made a whirlwind tour through Pittsburgh's minor league system, making a combined nine appearances with the Double-A Altoona Curve and Triple-A Indianapolis Indians, during which he posted a 1–1 record and an ERA of 0.93. The Pirates called Rogers up at the end of August, and Rogers made his major league debut on September 1, 2006. In ten appearances with the Pirates, Rogers posted an ERA of 8.31, but did not figure in any decisions. Rogers spent most of the 2007 season in Indianapolis, where he went 2–1 with a 3.05 ERA. The Pirates recalled Rogers briefly in May 2006, but optioned him back to Indianapolis after he gave up three runs (including two home runs) in just two innings of work. Rogers returned to the Pirates' minor leagues for 2008, but was released in mid-June. The Tigers, who had traded Rogers in 2006, promptly signed him to a contract and sent him to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. After posting an ERA of 7.65 in sixteen appearances the Tigers released Rogers to make room for Gary Glover. He finished the season playing for the Binghamton Mets in the New York Mets' minor leagues and became a free agent at the end of the season.

The teleplay by Craig Warner is a semi-fictionalized account of the life of Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, from 1952 until the mid-1970s. It was produced by Touchpaper Television, part of the RDF Media Group, and was broadcast by Channel 4. It has been released on DVD by BBC Video. Plot The drama opens with the disclaimer \\"Some of the following is based on fact. And some isn't\\". When Archbishop Fisher of the Church of England refuses her request to allow her and divorced war hero Peter Townsend, an equerry to her sister, to wed in a religious ceremony, and her brother-in- law and confidant Prince Philip advises her she will lose all her material possessions if they engage in a civil union, Margaret ends the relationship and plunges into a hedonistic lifestyle that frequently draws headlines in the press. She finds herself partnered with Tony Armstrong-Jones at a party that dissolves into an evening of sexual shenanigans, and she and the impoverished photographer begin to meet frequently for clandestine encounters in his dingy flat. When their relationship is made public, the two wed in an elaborate ceremony that is admired by those who embrace the monarchy and criticized by politicians who are shocked at the amount of money spent on the occasion while their constituents are struggling to get by on meagre wages. The turbulent marriage falls victim to Margaret's increased drinking and Tony's indiscreet womanizing. She treats him more like a subject than a spouse, and he eventually moves out. When she is caught in flagrante delicto with the pianist from a restaurant she frequents, she and Tony escape to their hideaway in Mustique and try to present a united front for the press, but their scheme backfires when they are criticized for their lavish lifestyle in the tropics. To escape the limelight, Margaret invites herself to the country home of her friends Rachel and Curly Burke. There she meets Roddy Llewellyn, a considerably younger aspiring pop singer. Shortly after she learns Robin Douglas-Home, with whom she once had a highly publicized affair, has committed suicide. Roddy suggests she stay with him at his cottage, which he shares with a commune of friends, to avoid the press, but a diligent photographer manages to catch them in an embrace. Tony Armstrong-Jones then announces the couple will divorce. Margaret's continued drinking, drug-abuse and deepening depression lead to her being hospitalized for several weeks for what is described as \\"exhaustion\\". After her release, she returns to Roddy, who announces he is marrying one of his housemates. Margaret departs for Mustique, and in the film's final moments she is seen standing in the surf and pondering her future. CastCritical reception The show aired on BBC America on 5 March 2006. In his review in Variety, Brian Lowry called the film \\"engaging if somewhat tawdry\\" and \\"occasional fun\\" and added, \\"Lucy Cohu does deliver a regal, rollicking performance in the title role ... [She] makes it all worth watching, conveying the contradictions - she can be down to earth and snotty all at once - that surely helped render Margaret an object of fascination in her time. Yet even with its sumptuous production values as Margaret jet-sets her way across the globe, it's a lightweight confection, especially when held up against the BBC's tony track record with historical fare. In other words, some BBC America productions are really outstanding, and some of them aren't.\\"Variety review On the website DVD Talk, Paul Mavis observed, \\"At times funny and satirical, at other times raunchy and low down, The Queen's Sister is always fast-moving and involving ... Propelling [it] along at breakneck speed is the lusty, vibrant performance by Lucy Cohu ... [who] is really quite affecting.\\"DVD Talk review Awards and nominations In the 2006 British Academy Television Awards, the film was nominated for Best Single Drama, and nominations went to Lucy Cohu for Best Actress, Simon Cellan Jones for Best Director, and James Keast for Best Costume Design. The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences nominated Cohu for Best Performance by an Actress, and the Royal Television Society named David Threlfall Best Actor for his performance in this and Shameless.

Songs= Balisong The song was re-released when Rivermaya came out with their International EP You'll Be Safe Here. Two music videos have been made for \\"Balisong\\". The first came out in 2004. It begins with a piano intro by vocalist Rico Blanco, then the band starts to play the song inside a room that is lit by sunlight. As the song progresses, pictures and letters are shown all over the room, revealing the \\"past relationship\\" that the song is portraying was being reminisced. The second video came out in 2006, when Rivermaya had just released their international debut \\"You'll Be Safe Here\\". The video was set in a carnival where Rivermaya is one of the acts. This video also shows Rico Blanco playing the piano, but to a lesser extent. As the video plays, Rico Blanco is attracted to a certain woman, dressed in a red gown. He then comes up to the woman and sings to her the chorus of the song. The song ends when all the carnival acts leave and the band is left alone. This video was renamed \\"Bali Song,\\" possibly to differentiate it from the first video. \\"Balisong\\" is one of very few OPM songs which have two different videos made for them. Other songs performed by OPM bands which have two music videos are \\"You'll Be Safe Here\\" also by Rivermaya, \\"Narda\\" and \\"Ambisyoso\\" by Kamikazee, \\"Stars\\" by Callalily, \\"Yugto\\" by Rico Blanco, and \\"With A Smile\\" by Eraserheads. In Philippine culture, balisong is a knife with a retractable blade. Strangely, the song does not reference the knife or even mentioned in the song lyrics. This song served as the official theme song of the 2017 movie 100 Tula Para Kay Stella, which stars Bela Padilla and JC Santos. Aside from the said movie in connection to the song, Balisong, the song is also used in CreamSilk's Modern Filipinas Transformed campaign with the appearances of Nadine Lustre, Yassi Pressman, Julie Anne San Jose, Coleen Garcia, Rachelle Ann Go, Heart Evangelista, Pia Wurtzbach, Lea Salonga, Anne Curtis & Sam Pinto in coincidence with the celebration of International Women's Day which is celebrated annually by all women worldwide.

Like Storer, McLaughlin was one of the originators of the art pottery movement that swept the United States. Biography Mary Louise McLaughlin was born to a wealthy family of Cincinnati, her father being the owner of a successful dry goods company in the city. Her older brother was architect James W. McLaughlin. Showing an artistic ability at a young age, McLaughlin did not take formal art lessons until 1871 at a private school for girls. In 1874, at Cincinnati's McMicken School of Design, later the Art Academy of Cincinnati, McLaughlin took a china painting class offered by a Mr. Benn Pitman. During an exhibition by Maria Longworth Nichols Storer at the school that same year, McLaughlin's interest in painting china ripened. In 1875, the two women's works were featured at The Centennial Tea Party to critical acclaim, and in 1876 both women had exhibitions at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While at the exhibition McLaughlin was especially taken by the works presented by Haviland & Co. of France, who showcased pieces that featured paintings using the underglaze technique. Since this was a unique advancement at the time, McLaughlin returned to Cincinnati with the determination to figure out the secret to their method. She also wrote a book on china painting upon her return which sold many copies (China Painting: A Practical Manual for the Use of Amateurs in the Decoration of Hard Porcelain). McLaughlin sold more of her works at the exhibition than Storer did, thus starting a competition of sorts between the two women. Portrait of Esther McLaughlin (the artist's niece), by Mary Louise McLaughlin, 1882, on porcelain In 1877 she worked out how to paint the porcelain under the glaze, and consequently became the first artist in the United States to implement the underglaze technique. Eventually other artists began utilizing this same technique, and in 1879 McLaughlin founded the Cincinnati Pottery Club along with Clara Chipman Newton and others. While it might seem logical that Storer would join the group, she declined an invitation to do so. This rivalry is likely what caused her to start Rookwood Pottery in the first place. Each member of the club had their pottery made at the Frederick Dallas Hamilton Road Pottery factory, and they would meet at the Women’s Art Museum Association located on Fourth Street in downtown Cincinnati. Eventually the group moved their meeting to the Dallas shop when the association moved to Cincinnati Music Hall. When Rookwood Pottery was opened, many of the workers from Frederick Dallas joined her team and effectively hindered some of the aspirations of McLaughlin and her group. In 1880 she published another work, titled Pottery Decoration under the Glaze. By this time the technique was already being implemented in other parts of the country. That same year, McLaughlin created one of her most celebrated vases, the Ali Baba Vase (so named by Newton). At 37 inches high (with a volume of 22 gallons), it was at that time the largest underglaze decorated vase in America. It features loosely painted hibiscus flowers on a sage green ground. Its success prompted Storer to counter with what became another famous piece, the Aladdin Vase, which was wider than the Ali Baba Vase though not as tall. The following year, Frederick Dallas died and his shop closed, leaving McLaughlin and her club to rent a room at Rookwood Pottery. In 1883 Storer evicted the club due to the conflict of interest involved in housing them, though she continued to have her pottery pieces made at Rookwood. While the club continued to showcase their work, they were outshone by Rookwood during their tenure. This in part caused McLaughlin to take up portrait painting in the 1890s, taking classes from Frank Duveneck in what was his first painting lesson. In 1890 Rookwood had changed ownership, and a William W. Taylor was the new owner. Taylor, under the direction of Storer, started making claims that McLaughlin was not the true discoverer of the underglaze method. He went so far as to demand the withdrawal of a statement by Clara Chipman Newton in an 1893 pottery catalog to the effect that McLaughlin was the founder of the technique in America. This never happened, but the incident effectively terminated any remnants of a relationship the two women had once shared. McLaughlin exhibited two etchings and a portrait of Henry L. Fry at the Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In the 1890s Mclaughlin returned to pottery, this time working out of her own backyard in the studio pottery style (the hardest of its kind). She effectively went from painting porcelain to creating it. Starting from 1885, McLaughlin was assisted in her work by her companion and housekeeper of 47 years, Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Hickey. Hickey was an Irish immigrant who started working for McLaughlin when she was about 20 years old. By the winter of 1898-1899 she was doing all the casting of the ware, and by the fall of 1901 she was also managing all the firing. In 1906 Mclaughlin gave up pottery and began writing again. Hickey died in 1932, still working for McLaughlin. In 1934 Grace W. Hazard (1869-1952) replaced Hickey; Hazard called McLaughlin \\"Ma\\" and she was the main beneficiary of McLaughlin's will, that was contested by McLaughlin's family. McLaughlin died January 19, 1939 at age ninety-one and is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery. Hazard is buried near her.

It was built to serve the Tacatacuru, a Mocama Timucua people. History San Pedro de Mocama was part of the missions system of Spanish Florida, a territory of New Spain. It was built c.1580 to serve the Tacatacuru peoples, a chiefdom of the Timucua. San Pedro was one of the earliest and most prominent missions of Spanish Florida, and its church was as big as the colonial one in St. Augustine. Together with Mission San Juan del Puerto on Fort George Island (in the mouth of the St. Johns River, Florida), it was one of the principal missions of what the Spanish came to know as the Mocama Province. San Pedro de Mocama, protected by an associated fort, was for a time at the northern extent of Spanish power, serving as a bulwark against the Guale people to the north. Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de de Puturibato was also built from 1595–1597 on Cumberland Island. Tacatacuru peoples The Tacatacuru were part of a Timucua group known as the Mocama. The Mocama spoke a dialect of Timucuan also known as Mocama and lived in the coastal areas of southern Georgia and northern Florida. Mission San Pedro was built at the south end of Cumberland Island, near the main village of the Tacatacuru. By 1595 some of the Tacatacuru−Mocama living near the mission were fluent in Spanish. Some had learned to read and write in a combination of Spanish, Latin, and the system of writing the Timucua language devised by Father Francisco Pareja, who worked at the San Juan del Puetro mission, located at the mouth of the St. Johns River at present-day Fort George Island. He wrote a catechism in Spanish and Timucuan that was printed in 1612. The Tacatacuru were severely affected by disease and warfare through the 17th century. Mission San Pedro de Mocama was abandoned in 1660. Pressure from other tribes led the Tacatacuru to abandon Cumberland Island by 1675.

The Syndicate At the beginning of the series, is introduced as a mysterious underground organization with no apparent objective. Its operatives work with both Contractors and Dolls and even have access to M.E. technology in order to erase sightings of their affairs from witness' minds. The Syndicate makes extensive use of \\"word of mouth\\" communication in relaying both missions and operative status. In the later course of the show, it is revealed that The Syndicate is in fact merely another façade for a global organization in control of PANDORA, that declares to be looking for stabilizing the world order and destroying Hell's Gate. At the ending of Ryūsei no Gemini, a new Syndicate is established consisting of Misaki, Kobayashi, Mao and Madame Oreille after American occupation forces have subdued the old Syndicate. From left to right: Huang, Yin, Hei, Mao ;: :Codename \\"Hei\\", he is an elite contractor with the Messier Code BK-201. Hei has a double persona in the series: as a civilian, he is referred to as , a good-natured Chinese exchange student living in an old apartment complex for foreigners and getting by through brief part-time jobs. These are typically related to the current mission he is on. When he is working with the Syndicate, he acts almost exactly as a typical contractor, appearing to be cold and rational. Nonetheless, Hei still demonstrates compassion and sorrow, and these mannerisms are noted as unusual by other contractors. Hei began working with the Syndicate as a child assassin to protect his sister, Bai, in South America during the Heaven's Gate war. Hei's goal is to find her once again. Though he usually calls himself an exchange student, he has never once gone to any University throughout the course of the series, using his title as a student only to gain access to the gate on one occasion. At the end of the first series, his disappearance was reported as him getting deported. :Hei possesses the ability to generate electricity in deadly concentrations. It is revealed that Hei's abilities are inherited from his sister, Bai (the first contractor linked to BK-201), whose true contractor ability was manipulating molecules on the quantum level. Due to this control over molecules, Bai actually resides in Hei's body. Thus, even though he has the abilities of one, Hei is not a true contractor, because he has no obeisance (even if his habit to eat a lot of food is often mistaken as one) and can still express a range of emotion. Hei's trademark weapon is a double-bladed knife tied to a metal wire, which he uses as an offensive weapon, a grappling hook, and an electricity conductor. :In Season Two of Darker than Black series, Hei loses his powers due to an anti- contractor device developed by Section 3, and relies only on his skills as a human to survive. He also begins taking care of Suoh Pavlichenko and the Doll July as they head from Russia back to Tokyo. :He develops a deep attachment to Yin later in the series. Even after she is taken over by a being from the gate known as Izanami, he still refuses to kill her. At the end of the second season, Hei is seen walking from Hell's Gate with Yin's body in his arms. It is unknown whether he \\"killed\\" her or extracted Izanami with his control over molecules. His whereabouts are unknown. :\\"Hei\\" is the Chinese pronunciation for the Mandarin character \\"黒\\", meaning \\"black.\\" The Japanese reading is \\"kuro\\", corresponding to Hei's nickname as \\"Kuro no Shinigami\\", or the \\"Black God of Death\\". ;: :A member of Hei's team, an emotionless spirit medium known as a \\"Doll\\". Her power lies in tracking and observation through direct contact with water. Huang mentions that her \\"program\\" is a minimal one, incapable of showing emotion or even allowing her to make decisions for herself; however, she later debunks this by making the decision to keep working with Hei and the others when given the choice of leaving, a possible sign of her recovering her humanity. Yin is of Finnish origin and her real name is Kirsi, which is the Finnish diminutive form of either Kirsikka (meaning \\"cherry\\") or Christina.http://www.behindthename.com/name/kirsi She was once a student of a famed Finnish pianist named Eelis Kastinen (or Kostinen, depending on translation; both are Finnish surnames), who slowly started developing a love interest in her mother. Yin's father died in a plane crash; in the aftermath, Yin's mother was left vulnerable and realized her own love for Kastinen. As they were about to kiss one night, Yin saw them, and ran away in shock. She ran onto the street, and was almost run over by an incoming truck, but was saved when her mother pushed her out of the way, trading her own life in the process. Little, if anything, is known about how Yin became a Doll, but it seems to be linked to her personal tragedy. :It is implied that she has feelings for Hei, when Amber compared that they were both similar in that aspect and asked her to take care of him. Throughout the course of the series, Yin begins to display emotions and her own will, deciding to follow Hei and remain to be his partner, and even observes and notices a change in his behavior, despite not being ordered to do so. This has been made apparent when she called Hei from the void to come back to her and not leave her alone. In the process, her observation apparition evolved or upgraded, now having a human-like body shaped with her silhouette and is capable of physical touch. Episode 2 of Gaiden reveals that \\"Izanami\\" possessed Yin during the events of episode 25, which explains her new abilities. :\\"Yin\\" means silver, and is the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of \\"銀\\"; the Japanese pronunciation is \\"gin\\". It is pronounced with a hard \\"g\\" [g] instead of a soft \\"g\\" . ;: :Huang is the leader of Hei's team, and is usually the one giving orders and explaining the mission to the members of the team. Huang is usually very demanding of everyone on the team and often makes clear his distaste of working with Contractors and Dolls. Aside from being the middle man between the Syndicate and Hei's team, Huang will usually show up to provide backup in situations that would have normally contributed to the loss of a team member. He is often seen in his trademark vest, coat, and beret, smoking a cigar and relaying information via cellphone. Prior to the start of the series, Huang was a police officer known as Kiyoshi Kuno. He met the Contractor Shihoko, who was the only person that he ever loved. However, she seemingly betrayed him, using his love to extract information from him to kill his partner and erase his partner's wife's memory. After the events, the Syndicate appeared and gave him a choice: join the Syndicate, or have his memories of the event erased. Huang chose the former, but the entire ordeal caused Huang's hatred towards Contractors and Dolls. When he met up with Shihoko again on another mission, Huang learned that she did actually love him, as her payment for being a Contractor was to feel human emotions again, and that she was the reason why his memories weren't erased, because to her, erasing someone's memories is the same thing as killing them. Later on, Huang and the rest of his team are cut out of the Syndicate. Huang later dies while helping Hei and the others get to Hell's Gate, exploding his own car that he drives while leading a large group of officers away from them. :His main weapon is a Beretta M 1934 pistol. He also used a bolt-action sniper rifle for shooting Itzhak in episode 14. :\\"Huang\\" is the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of \\"黄\\", literally meaning yellow, while the Japanese pronunciation is \\"ki\\". ;: :Mao is a Contractor who has the ability to possess animals, subduing their natural instincts. His Messier code is HM-432. His brain is directly connected to a wireless network which enables him to send and receive information at any time. Mao usually creates diversions for Hei in battle. While on an assignment in Russia following the Pavlichenko family, his human body was destroyed in the explosion that destroyed a laboratory, trapping him in the body of a black cat he was currently possessing. While he completely lost his need to fulfill a payment with the destruction of his body, he must connect periodically with the wireless network or run the risk of having the animal's natural instincts take over. Near the end of the first Season, his wireless connection was cut off when he defects from the Syndicate with the rest of his team, resulting in his human consciousness vanishing while in Hell's Gate; however, he manages to reunite with Hei via a backup network under the control of an unknown organization. It is likely that \\"Mao\\" is his codename; like Hei, his real name was never stated, though it could be speculated to be \\"Ricardo\\", as he is called by that name when he first meets Madam Oreille. At the beginning of the second season, he is also in hiding in Russia with Hei and resides in the body of Suoh's pet flying squirrel, Petya. :Mao hates the spring season, as most cats would try to find a partner to breed kittens. Later, this becomes a running gag, as even after he took over Petya, he was still being chased down by other cats, albeit likely as a food source rather than a mate. :\\"Mao\\" is the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of \\"猫\\", literally meaning \\"cat.\\" In Japanese, the cat is called \\"neko\\". Pavlichenko family Pavlichenko siblings during the events of Darker than Black. Shion(left) and Suoh (right). ;: : A 13-year-old girl who lives in Vladivostok, Russia. In the Gemini of the Meteor story arc, Suoh becomes involved in the war and machinations between the various groups and Contractors, and her life is forever changed when she meets Hei. She is Eurasian, with a Japanese mother and Russian father. She also has a twin brother, Shion, who uses a wheelchair. She is later revealed to have some form of contractor ability when she goes into mental shock, which awakens her latent powers. She can manifest an anti-tank rifle (PTRD) from a meteor fragment she wears as a pendant, and can wield the rifle easily despite its heavy weight of the weapon and powerful recoil; however, even though the weapon comes with its own ammunition each time it is created, the wear and tear on it remains, so Suoh must maintain it like any other gun.Darker Than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini episode 4 The payment for her power is to fold origami. Her stated goal is to kill all Contractors (though this might have changed due to Hei), and the awakening of her latent powers is referred to by some characters as the \\"beginning of the end\\". After meeting her mother, Suoh discovers that she is actually a 'copy' of the original Suoh who died in an explosion many years ago, created by Shion's power.Darker Than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini episode 10 After reuniting with Shion, Suoh appears to die after the meteor fragment she is carrying breaks. Later, it is revealed that she has been transported to an alternate world without Contractors (including her brother), where she can live a normal life, with no memory of her previous one. ;: :Suoh's twin brother, recognized by various organizations as Izanagi, the counterpart to the Izanami entity that has possessed Yin. He was believed to have lost his right eye due to an accident with a falling meteor core fragment during the Tokyo explosion, and that this incident also turned him into a Contractor. It is later revealed that he was in fact born a Contractor, a unique occurrence according to Mao's words, and that the meteorite incident was actually a fake memory he put into his sister's mind. His Contractual payment is to lose the use of his legs every time he uses his power, forcing him to constantly use a wheelchair. His power allows him to create a near- perfect clone of anything, with only one flaw from the original. He also displays telepathic abilities, being able to mentally contact his sister and instruct her in how to get to safety during an attack on their home; though perhaps this could have been traces left in his sister memories triggered by events he and his father planned ahead. He leaves behind a clue for Suoh telling her he has left for Japan, which drives her to leave Russia to find him. He is reunited with Suoh in Hell's Gate, where he wishes for a world where Suoh can live a normal life before being killed by Izanami. ;: :Suoh and Shion's father, and the husband of Asako Makimiya. Dr. Pavlichenko works for a research group studying the time and space distortion effects occurring on the planet. He also created of the memory eraser. He is believed to have been killed by Hei, but it is later revealed that it had just been another of Shion's copies. He used to be involved with The Syndicate, until they decided to pull the plug and bombed his laboratory, accidentally killing Suoh and Mao in the process. Aware that the current Suoh is a copy of the original, he still regards and loves her as the daughter she would have become had she lived, rather than as a replica or replacement for the original. After being reunited with Suoh, Dr. Pavlichenko is mortally wounded while rescuing her from government forces and dies. ;: : Suoh and Shion's estranged mother, who divorced her husband several years ago. She works as a photographer in Japan and Suoh purchases all of the albums that she makes. When Suoh is reunited with her mother in Japan, Asako initially mistakes her for Shion. When Suoh corrects her, a shocked Asako reveals that Suoh died eight years ago in the laboratory explosion and rejects Suoh, whom Asako has realized is actually a copy of the original Suoh that Shion must have created. Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Its HQ is temporarily located at present day Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation HQ, 19-2, Nishi-Shinjuku 3-chome, Shinjuku. The real-life MPD HQ at Kasumigaseki is now within the restricted area of the Hell's Gate in the Darker than Black universe. From left to right: Yutaka Kouno, Yuusuke Saitou, Misaki Kirihara, Kunio Matsumoto. Public Security Bureau Foreign Affairs Section 4 A division with the PSB, dedicated for Contractor-related cases. Due to Hōrai's actions at the ending of Darker than Black, the Japanese government decided to disband the division and reassigned its officers to different divisions within the force. ;: :The Section-Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section 4 who is investigating matters that concern Contractors. Misaki has long brown hair and glasses and rarely smiles or laughs. She has a strong sense of justice and a sharp intuition. Kirihara became a policewoman in order to protect the weak, has a distaste for smokers due to their smell, and is sensitive about the exposure of her body. She likes eating greasy food but claims to stay fit due to constantly moving around every day as part of her job. Her father is Superintendent Supervisor Naoyasu Kirihara of the National Police Agency. It appears that she has feelings for Hei, or at least his civilian alias, Li. :After the events of Darker than Black and the Darker than Black: Shikoku no Hana manga, she resigns from the section and relocates to the Hachijo-Jima police station. She is then recruited into Section 3 with the alias of . ;: :A subordinate of Kirihara's, who traditionally wears a business suit. Despite being an officer, he seems to have little common sense as he infiltrated a gang operation undercover using his real name. He admits to finding Kirihara scary, but in the OVA it was revealed that he also harbors more romantic feelings for her. He still works in the Department, but secretly maintains contact with Misaki. ;: :Saito's partner. A reckless, hot-headed officer, who often provides comic relief in the otherwise serious police station. ;: :The oldest member of Section 4. In the events of Shikoku no Hana, he was severely wounded with his left arm dismembered while being on a Section 4 assignment, forcing Matsumoto to early retirement. ;: :Section 4's liaison officer with the Astronomy Bureau. In her private time, she's an otaku who enjoys anime and does anime/manga-based fanfiction stories.Mayu: \\"Just between us, I was in the manga club of my university and I'm actually pretty into it... My hobby is writing stories.\\" (Beneath the Fully Bloomed Cherry Blossoms OVA) Public Security Bureau ; :Misaki's boss; the Chief of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Public Security Bureau. It was revealed in the final episode of Season One that he was a member of the Syndicate, and that he had planned the genocide of contractors with other influential members of the Syndicate. National Astronomical Observatory of Japan Its HQ is located at the present day National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Mitaka Campus, Mitaka. It is affiliated with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. It monitors and provides information on the actions of the Stars of Contractors in the \\"false sky\\". After Darker than Black and Darker than Black: Shikoku no Hana, the entire observatory was officially declared closed with its equipment and personnel taken over by Section 3. ;: :Kirihara's friend since high school and a head staffer at the observatory. In Shikoku no Hana, Kanami relocates to Hawaii after accepting a job there. ;: :A strange monk who sits in the center of the observatory and appears to be the chief observer of the stars. She speaks riddles or prophecy, and has been seen to be able to speak during Amber's freezing of time. Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications In the Darker than Black world, the MIAC has a black ops division known as Section 3, created 2 years after the attack on the PANDORA institute to eliminate any individual/group with links to the Syndicate. Currently, its present location is unknown. In addition to its mostly Contractor agents, Section 3 has a covert paramilitary commando force armed with small arms, such as the MP5 submachine gun, and tactical gear. MIAC operatives in Ryusei no Gemini. From left to right: Yōko Sawasaki, Mina Hazuki and Genma Shizume. ;: :Head of the 2nd Investigate Division of the MIAC's Statistics Bureau. However, the position is merely a cover as head of Section 3. After the United States invades Tokyo and takes over the Gate, Gorō goes underground with Misaki. He resembles Golgo 13 with glasses, revealing a quite muscular body under his clothes, and has the same rifle. ;: :A representative working for the Third Chief Clerk in the 2nd Investigative Division of the Statistics Bureau in the MIAC, as well as a Contractor. Despite his status as a contractor, Genma has a habit of saying some odd things, many of them implying he is a sexual deviant. He is shown to be fairly bumbling as well, as he is the only one who still believes Suoh is Shion. His ability allows him to cover his body with whatever material he touches in order to form tank armour, taking from the object until he is sufficiently covered. His armored form enhances the power of his punches and protects him from bullets. His remuneration is to have moxibustion treatment each time his power is used. He uses traditional budō. It is later revealed that he is a double agent for the CIA, and is responsible for Yōko's death. He is killed by Mina who stabs him through the head with her sword. ;: :A colleague of Genma's, Mina is a Contractor with the ability to charge any object with energy, which she uses to create potent projectiles from scraps and turn her sword into a \\"lightsaber\\". She also uses retractable wires similar to Hei's. Her remuneration is to passionately kiss a man, which she appears to dislike due to \\"bad aftertaste\\"; such is her distaste that with even two mouth washings, she resorts to kissing another woman to remove the taste, though she hints to having an interest in women. She seems to specialize in wetwork, wearing a half-faced balaclava and wielding a wooden katana (which she transforms using her ability). After killing Genma in revenge for Yōko's death, Mina disappears. ;: :A staff member of the MIAC team with Genma and Mina. She usually performs support duties such as driving them around or tapping radio communications. She is captured by Hei, who interrogates her for Yin's location. She is murdered by Genma by putting her through ME Squeezer and probably also by torturing her in the process, as her body is left severely beaten, unlike Pavlichenko's. ;: :An agent of Section 3. She was formerly a housewife to a local restaurant owner named Lebanon, who left him and their son Norio after turning to a Contractor by unknown means. She can manipulate a water source as a weapon and her remuneration is to bake cakes. She loses control of her powers in a battle with Suoh, due to Yin's apparent interference, and dies drowning in a sphere of water. Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) Like its real-life counterpart, its HQ is located at Vauxhall Cross. British Intelligence originally sent three operatives to Japan to retrieve Havoc. There are five known members: ;: :MI6's top agent, and a field leader whose civilian alias is Jack Simon. November 11 is charged with investigating BK-201 and his cohorts. November's ability enables him to freeze liquids, including blood in the human body he does not have direct contact with. He is able to shape water into projectiles by freezing it and subsequently hurl them with lethal precision. He can also create protective shields out of frozen water. November 11 has a strong aversion to tobacco, though to his dismay, his remuneration is smoking cigarettes. Through the series, he develops a close professional relationship with Misaki. After he discovers the true motives of the organization he works for he confronts Decade, becoming fatally wounded in the process. He later dies on the street after leaving a voice message on April's phone. ;: :A woman who supports November 11. Her power creates hurricanes which result in downpours, coating everything in water so that November 11 can freeze it. She can also control water more precisely, being able to engulf a person's head in water to drown him or her. Her remuneration is to drink beer, specifically Guinness Stout in the anime. In contrast to November 11, she very much enjoys her remuneration due to her love for alcohol. She dies at the hands of Hei in season two's first episode of Gemini of the Meteor. ;: :A young child most often seen being led around by April. He is a Doll whose observation powers rely on glass as a medium. He considers November and April to be his friends, a fact that initially astonishes Misaki and November as dolls are not supposed to think outside of their programming. April and July frequently visit November 11's roadside site of death with offers of a bouquet or cigarettes and a beer or two. In the third episode of the 2nd season, July assists Suoh by helping her direct her new-found powers against the FSB and the MIAC, and later joins up with Hei's group, although his motivations for joining them remain unclear. However, it is implied later on that he has fallen in love with Suoh. After he and Suoh are killed by Izanami, they are both seen in the alternate world Shion created, with July being a normal boy instead of a doll. ;: :A member of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). November 11's superior. He is killed by November 11 in Episode 22 after November discovers Decade's involvement in the massive effort to destroy Hell's Gate. ;: :Appearing in the Gemini of the Meteor story arc, August 7 is a Contractor who works at MI6. He has the ability to distort space around himself, allowing him to pull weapons out of thin air, as well as dodge bullets and knives. His remuneration is revealing the secrets of a magic trick. He is also nicknamed \\"Magician\\", and he wears a red coat and a black silk top hat. After April's death, August goes after Hei and Suoh, but encounters the FSB. He dispatches the FSB agents easily and continues his pursuit, where he has a showdown with Hei. He is defeated and electrocuted by Hei, although he remains barely alive. Genma Shizume apparently finishes him off after Hei and Suoh escape into the sea, although no star is seen falling. In episode 12, he is still alive, appearing in Hell's Gate and asking July to return to MI6 due to the cancellation of their mission, and leaving without the latter when July refused to leave, amused at his display of emotions. Evening Primrose An organization promoting equal rights for contractors and their existence to be made public. Contrary to the popular belief, EPR does not intend for Contractors to rise above humanity, but rather seeking a solution for the peaceful coexistence of Contractors and human beings. ;: : The first confirmed Contractor, with her star's Messier code UB-001. She was originally a spy for MI6 with the codename but later defected and joined the Syndicate, adopting \\"Amber\\" as her new name. She worked together with Hei and Bai in South America during the \\"Heaven's War\\", and founded her own organization, the Evening Primrose at that time. She went missing together with Bai and millions of other people when the Heaven's Gate disappeared, only to reappear later to fight the Syndicate with the rest of the strengthened Evening Primrose. Even after leaving the Syndicate, she chose to keep her codename \\"Amber,\\" stating that she had grown attached to it. Her appearance is also very similar to Code Geass character C.C.. :Amber's ability is chronal manipulation, which includes temporal freezing of time and rewinding of events to an unknown degree. Elaborate usage of her power enables her to gain knowledge of future events, and then respond to them accordingly. Once time has been frozen around her, she can also pull other people out of the frozen time stream, while those still under her ability's effect will no longer detect her presence or movement. Her remuneration is aging backwards, making her appear frequently younger. Amagiri has warned her that she cannot use her ability flippantly, saying that she can only pay off her contract to a certain extent. Her overall objective is to destroy the Hell's Gate in a way that doesn't erase every Contractor from existence. Amber cares deeply about and has feelings for Hei, in spite of him believing her to be a traitor. To emphasize this, she often goes as far as to order her subordinates to avoid fighting Hei, even though this usually veers close to compromising their given mission objective. She maintains the mysterious Meteor Fragment retrieved from PANDORA's Gate Research Facility in her care in a pouch slung across her shoulder. After showing him all that he would have if he used his power to close off the gate (her, his friends, and his sister), she reveals the true extent of her feelings for him by sacrificing herself so that Hei may pursue, instead, the option of shutting down the particle accelerator that would destroy the gate instead of sacrificing Japan or all Contractors. In the Ryuusei no Gemini arc, when Misaki accesses the \\"Files of the Future\\" she is seen behind her before disappearing when she turns around. ;: : A portly, red- haired man whose left eye is frequently shut. His contractor ability enables him to project concussive blasts from his palms. He appears to be Amber's right-hand man, carrying out operations necessary to the Evening Primrose. His remuneration is the consumption of boiled eggs - a fact he does not like due to the cholesterol in them. Surviving the fire in season 1, he gathers the remnants of EPR and retreats into deep jungle. He is later seen rescuing Hei and Yin in Hong Kong after receiving intelligence on the whereabouts of the duo. ;: : A blonde-haired woman whose cover was as a secretary in the American embassy in Japan. Her ability is to teleport herself and anyone she is in contact with; however, any clothing is left behind. Brita's remuneration is to kiss other people, which she often combines into one convenient act when teleporting others. She uses her ability to, among other actions, kidnap the researcher Schroeder for the EPR and help Amagiri get to the anti-Gate particle accelerator. Curiously, she seems to have grown accustomed to the inevitable nudity to the point of preference. She is presumed killed in Pandora's attack against \\"Evening Primrose\\" \\"dolls\\" after being almost burnt to death alongside Amagiri. ;: : A young boy with heterochromatic irises. Maki's ability allows him to perform a type of spontaneous combustion on objects that he touches with his hands. The explosions can occur remotely as he often prepares handprints before activating his ability. He uses this to cause attacks on the embassies in Tokyo. His remuneration is drinking hot milk. Maki seems to be infatuated with Amber and says he would do anything for her. He attempts to kill Hei out of jealousy, after learning Hei is the \\"him\\" that Amber frequently spoke of, convinced that he (Maki) is the only one fit of her love. He is killed by November 11. ;: : (childhood) : Hei's younger sister. Bai is the Contractor responsible for the disappearance of Heaven's Gate five years prior to the story's setting and had since vanished.Darker than Black Episode 23 The Messier code BK-201 belongs to her star. Bai's abilities are said to be vast, with generating abnormal electricity as only the tip of the iceberg. In addition to this, she also has the power of molecular reconstruction. Her remuneration is to sleep. At the time of the Heaven's War in South America, Hei was constantly together with Bai during their many operations, acting as a bodyguard of sorts. It was for Bai's sake that Hei originally joined the Syndicate. When the Heaven's Gate disappeared, Bai's power became Hei's, because—according to Amber—she continues to exist within him by fusion through her molecular reconstruction ability. Hei himself remains oblivious to the fact, until the very end. Her other name is revealed at the end: Xing (which may in this instance mean \\"star\\".) PANDORA Physical quantity Alternation Natural Deconstruction Organized Research Agency (PANDORA) is a UN research agency established to investigate Hell's Gate in Tokyo. It is revealed that the Syndicate has sway with the organization and has plans to commit genocide against all Contractors by eliminating Hell's Gate. ;: : A Japanese-American man. He is a high-ranking official within PANDORA. He had influence over Japanese law enforcement over anything related to PANDORA. It is revealed that he is also a high-ranking official within the Syndicate and was placed in charge of destroying Hell's Gate after he had placed a termination for Hei, Mao, Yin and Huang. Hourai later shoots him after Hei destroys the Saturn Ring system. In Shikokku no Hana, his father makes his appearance. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Following the loss of the dominant superpower position, the CIA strives to restore the United States to her former glory by engaging in various international subvert operations, even as far as going for an all-out invasion on Tokyo at the end of the Season 2. ;: :A scientist who Hei meets as he infiltrates PANDORA. Nick and Hei become friends and both have a fascination with the \\"real sky\\". Nick turns out to be a contractor and is revealed to have the ability to manipulate electricity, apparently the same as Hei's ability. His remuneration is putting people's shoes on the ground upside-down next to each other. He became close to Hei, thinking that they were both alike, not just in their abilities, but even their dream of wanting to see the real starry sky. He felt that of all the people, he didn't want Hei to know he was a contractor and to get him involved. After he and Hei battle for the artifact known as the \\"meteor fragment\\" Nick disappears as soon as the artifact is activated. Apparently, the meteor fragment reacted with Hei and allowed him to make Nick's \\"dream\\" come true, which is to have a rocket (which looks very comical) to send both Nick (who became a young boy in his dream) and his sister to space. Nick's ability to have an ambition is a mystery even to himself since contractors shouldn't have emotion. ;: :A courier who exhibits erratic behavior after infiltrating Pandora. Murdered by Nick. ;: :Full name John Smith, a CIA agent who makes frequent contact with Madame Oreille in regards to finding out what happened to Hei after going rogue against the CIA. An avid reader of the Art of War, he is often seen quoting phrases found in the book. He later stages the American occupation of Tokyo and Hell's Gate to regain United States' technological dominance. Russian Intelligence Two Russian intelligence agencies appear in the series: Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) and Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The FSB is the domestic security agency of Russian homeland, acting similarly to the FBI in United States. Meanwhile, the SVR is responsible for intelligence and espionage activities outside of the Russian Federation. It is shown in the series that the SVR has stationed its operatives in various parts of Japan, including Hokkaido and Tokyo. ;: :Bertha is a large lady and a former opera singer. She is a Contractor that is able to control the resonance of sound. By resonating a frequency that is the inverse of a target's resonance frequency, she can destroy a target. This can also cause other body problems, such as a heart attack, by matching the hearts resonance frequency. Bertha's remuneration is to ingest a foreign substance and then vomit it out; for example, she is shown paying by eating a handful of cigarettes and then vomiting them up. It does not have to be cigarettes but she recounts her past to Itzhak about how she had a baby, who unfortunately choked to death while ingesting one of Bertha's dropped cigarettes. Bertha is killed by Hei in trying to retrieve Yin. ;: :Itzhak is a companion of Bertha. He is a Contractor with the ability to capture the \\"specters\\" projected by Dolls. He steals many from the astronomy division's mediums. It appears that when he captures them he can also acquire knowledge from the controller of the specters. Itzhak's remuneration is writing poetry, although he is not very good at it, shown by Bertha commenting that it sounds like a teenage girl wrote it, and that he should at least have it rhyme. (He responds that he had never done this before the contract). Itzhak is killed by Huang with a sniper rifle, but before his life ends, he releases all the specters that he had captured. ;: :An agent working in the FSB, Goran is a Russian Contractor who is able to move at super speed to the extent he could dodge bullet hits easily. His remuneration is to eat hamburgers, and he keeps them on hand in a bag whenever he is out on field work. He will even offer the hamburgers to his enemies, that is if they are willing to submit and surrender peacefully. During a raid on a Dr. Pavlichencko's lab, Goran escapes the huge explosion in the lab and later engages April in a battle in the forest nearby. He is killed when April tricks him into running through raindrops at high speed, which punch holes through his body. Later, his corpse, along with his bag of burgers, is seen alongside April's, with an associate telling Repnin, a leading FSB agent, that Goran did not live up to his expectations. ;: :A contractor with the Russian SVR. His ability is to shut off the brain functions of his victims, causing them to get deprived of oxygen and asphyxiate to death slowly. Ilya is psychotic, sadistic and depraved, and, according to him, he has murdered many women brutally before becoming a Contractor, just to watch them suffer. After he became a contractor, he became more \\"rational\\", and started using his ability to deliver a \\"relaxing\\" death to his victim. He initially debuts in Hokkaido as he murders an underground doll-trading informant in the toilet of a roadside food outlet. His remuneration is drawing sketches. Although not obliged to do so, Ilya has a tendency to draw rather gruesome images as his payment, particularly of women in death poses with severed limbs and heads. He kidnaps Suoh, Mao and July, intending to hand them over to his superiors, but Hei manages to intercept him. Without his contractor abilities, Hei almost loses to Ilya until he manages to strangle him with his grapple wire. Ironically, Ilya suffers the same sad fate as his past victims -- suffocating to death. ;: :A close friend of Suoh and Nika, attending the same school as them. She awakens to her latent Contractor abilities at the start of the second season, gaining the ability to summon a seemingly limitless swarm of flesh-devouring cockroaches and joining the FSB soon after. Her apparent remuneration is pulling out strands of her hair. As an FSB agent, she confronts Suoh and Hei, demanding to know Shion's whereabouts. She battles Hei, and uses her cockroaches to devour her former boyfriend Nika, killing him almost instantly, before a surprise shot from awakened Suoh knocks her out. Despite the coldness she shows towards the death of Nika, Tanya is later shown to catch glimpses of the time she and Nika spend together.Darker Than Black: Meteor of Gemini, episode 8 She is killed after being shot by Shion Pavlichenko from afar using a PTRD-41, the same weapon manifested by Suoh's contractor abilities, which has misled Hei into believing that Suoh has pulled the trigger. Underworld ;: : An information broker with a vast information network and knowledge on a number of subjects. She recruits Hei on behalf of the CIA to capture Shion Pavlichenko. She entrusted Hei with the mission to take down a Section 3 cargo before he cut off all ties with her. Her known clients include Agent Smith (CIA) and Misaki Kirihara. She also appears on the rooftop in Ikebukuro informing Suoh of her mother's scheduled arrival at Haneda International Airport. She is seen using a ray gun (a miniature version of the Saturn Ring anti-Gate particles accelerator) on a Section 3 contractor. How she obtain such a weapon remains unknown, as it is developed by Dr. Schroeder exclusively for Section 3 following the destruction of Saturn Ring by Hei in the first season. It appears that she may have had a romantic relationship with Mao in the past, addressing Mao by the name Ricardo. Notable Contractors ;: :A middle school student and the daughter of Kōzō Tahara, the only survivor from Hell's Gate. There is a significant emotional detachment between Mai and her father and Mai chose to adopt her deceased mother's maiden name. As a result of her father's attempts to subdue her Contractor powers, she became a Moratorium but eventually reverts to a Contractor. Her power allows her to create and manipulate fire. Her remuneration takes the form of humming a song. She seems to think of Hei as an older brother. She reappears as a contractor of the syndicate, protecting the Saturn anti-Gate particle accelerator, and burns Amagiri using her powers. She is thought to be crushed to death by falling debris from the Saturn system. ;: :A Regressor who lost her powers and a significant portion of her memories after Heaven's Gate disappeared in South America, five years prior to the story's setting. She was found in a Romanian village after the incident and had lost both her power and memories, and was isolated from the Syndicate. She lived together with a family in the village, which had greatly influenced her to change emotionally, she discovered simple things such as eating and cooking to be fun. She wanted to cook more for the children, wanting to see more of their smiles. The reason why she was discovered again was not clear, but she was discovered by the MI-6 and brought to PANDORA. She used to be one of the most notorious and feared Contractors, rumored to have killed hundreds to thousands of people during the South American War. Her former powers are unknown, but are said to be similar to creating a vacuum.Darker than Black episode 5 Her remuneration was to drink the blood of children.Darker than Black episode 6 Havoc, whose real name is Carmine, and Hei have some history together; this becomes apparent when Hei interrogates Havoc about the whereabouts of his missing sister Bai, and that she also noticed that he still had the same big appetite but he had changed for the better since he was more emotional, causing her to laugh aloud. Hei notes that it was the first time he had seen her do so, to which she also notes that she's not good at it, and so was Hei. When Havoc decided to help Hei in finding his sister by regaining her memories, she had hoped that she would be able to handle her abilities because of her change, but unable to do so, she wanted Hei to kill her because she doesn't want to kill any more. However, Hei refuses to do so wanting to save her by getting her out of the gate, but in her confusion she later dies at the hands of November 11, unable to deliver her last message to Hei after her memories and powers returned from being near the gate. ;: :A Contractor by code VI-952. Wei has an elvish appearance with narrow eyes, pointy ears and shoulder-length black hair. He attempted to overthrow and take over the Chinese gang by murdering many of its executives. Prior to this he acted as the bodyguard of the Qing Long Tang's leader's daughter, Alice Wang. His contract allows him to disintegrate anything his blood spills onto by snapping his fingers. Conveniently, his remuneration is shedding blood, allowing him to cut his heavily scarred arm so that he can spill or fling blood onto targets to use his power.Darker than Black episode 10 He is thought to have died after being electrocuted and beaten by Hei in a battle, however, it is later revealed by Huang that his body mysteriously disappeared from the morgue. He later reappears as a member of the Evening Primrose, revealing a shorter haircut and a burn-like scar covering much of the left side of his face due to being electrocuted by Hei. He joined the Evening Primrose to get an opportunity for a rematch with Hei, who Wei states is the only person to have beaten him. Mao observes that Wei's desire to fight Hei due to feeling humiliated is very unusual for a Contractor, as there is a possibility he will die.Darker than Black episode 23 After being mortally wounded by Hei in a fight, he admits defeat and uses his ability to destroy both himself and the wall behind him, giving Hei access to Hell's Gate. ;: :A Contractor who started her own religion intended for those like herself. Pursued by the Syndicate for killing one of their operatives, her congregation is in danger of being brought down. It is she who first brings to light what contractors really are and how they differ from normal humans, this truth being the reason why she started her religion. Her contract is the ability to transform her physical appearance to match a target exactly at the cost of her longevity. Thus, because of her skills, she had been utilized as an infiltrator and assassin. Though young in appearance to her followers, her true form is that of an elderly woman due to extensive use of her contract. She later exhibits emotions unlike a contractor where she truly wished to create a haven for her fellow contractors. She relayed her past and ambitions to Hei as her last message, accepting her fate, which in of itself was not befitting of a contractor to do so, since she could've prolonged her life by escaping. ;: :An operative of The Syndicate even longer than Huang, Shihoko is a contractor tasked with the job of infiltrating Alma's organization to gather intel for an eventual assassination. Years ago, she was tasked with assassinating Isozaki, Huang's partner when the two were detectives, after learning that he was linked to covering up the murder of one of the syndicate's operatives. She had gotten very close to Huang in order to figure out which of the two was working for Alma's organization, leaving Huang with an emotional scar for many years. Her contract allows her to destroy the internal organs of an individual at the cost of regaining her human sensitivity for a short time. The remuneration can put her in a state of psychological shock due to the abrupt swing of emotion. Although she experiences human emotions during her remuneration, she realizes that her feelings for Huang were genuine because even though her contractor emotions came back, the memories she had together with him still made her feel warm. She later commits suicide by jumping in front of a truck, saving Huang from being targeted by the Syndicate. ;;: :A contractor who works for the Syndicate who was sent to capture Yin, he appears in Darker Than Black Gaiden. Claude's core ability is the control of people; he can also control people's senses, putting them under illusions. He was even able to trick Hei into thinking he was Amber. His remuneration is that he must eat the petal of a flower. Claude possessed a high degree of irrationality, unlike most other contractors. He does not seem to care about his own safety, but is only intent on causing chaos whenever he can. This may stem from his nihilistic attitude towards the world which he has displayed on several occasions. His main goal is to awaken Izanami, for he believes that she will create a world where Contractors would rule over humans. He manages to capture Yin, and at first his intentions seem to be selling Yin to the highest bidder. However, he calls all the major intelligence agencies at once, causing them to arrive all at the same time and engage in a massive four-way fight. The Chinese are the first to get through to him, and Claude seemingly strikes a deal with them. However, he later calmly throws the money he gains out of the window, and tricks Hei into awakening Izanami. The Chinese agents tackle him for his betrayal, and Claude willingly allows himself to be shot three times in the stomach. He lives long enough to be killed by Izanami. Minor characters Umitsuki Apartment residents. From left to right: Louis, Babo, Joshua, Irene. ;: :Hei's landlady. She is usually seen chasing Mao away from the house. She also likes to compliment Hei for being such a good boy. ;: :Misuzu's husband. He speaks very rarely and mostly tends his plants. ; :Hei's Neighbor, who has only one line, which is at the end of the OVA episode, despite appearing more frequently than other tenants. He catches Mayu Ōtsuka spying on Hei and became convinced she was stalking himself. He brought flowers for her at the end of the OVA, but stated in his one line that, \\"She isn't coming, is she?\\" ;: :A dark skinned Filipino woman with orange hair who lives beneath Hei. She moved to Japan to make money for her family back in her homeland by working as a bartender. ;: :Hei's Neighbor. Almost never seen without his guitar. ;: :Hei's Neighbor. He came to Japan from Israel. He has an interest in Japanese animation, claiming it is #1 in the world. ;: :Gai Kurasawa is Japan's \\"number one\\" detective. Formerly known as Gai Matsukichi, he was a police officer who quit the force to start his own detective agency. He uses unorthodox methods to solve mysteries and crimes, is afraid of cats, has horrible body odor and athlete's foot, and is struggling financially. ;: : Gai Kurasawa's assistant, she is obsessed with manga and anime. She's often seen partaking in cosplay and reading fanfiction. Her character is perceived as a flamboyant parody of the stereotypical \\"fangirl\\". She also has a crush on Hei, and consistently plots methods of stalking him. In the season 1 OVA, she swoons over his perfect collarbones. Kiko also makes multiple attempts at befriending Yin, and has included her in her cosplay, despite the fact that she's a doll. But despite her somewhat childish nature, Kiko also can be very level-headed, making attempts at keeping Gai grounded while he's on a case, and is constantly concerned about his business's financial status. She sometimes can come off as money-grubbing, and willing to do anything for a quick buck. She's referred to by Mao as \\"that pink girl.\\" Series terminology ; :A powerful organization of Contractors led by February, a former MI6 agent codenamed \\"Amber\\". They aim to reveal the existence of Contractors to the general public, and to promote their status as a new race/group of humans. Special rights and privileges for Contractors are also on their list of objectives. ; :A mysterious and chaotic area of space that appeared in Tokyo ten years before the start of the series. Its appearance led to the rise of Contractors and Dolls. A massive Gate Wall has been constructed around it to keep civilians—or anyone else, for that matter—from entering. Several countries, including Japan, are cautiously conducting research on the Hell's Gate, exemplified by a top-secret research facility PANDORA built next to the Gate Wall. ; :Another chaotic area of space that appeared in South America and seemingly disappeared five years before the beginning of the series, along with everything in a 1500 km radius around it. Its exact nature at this point is unknown in the series. Its appearance apparently started a large-scale war, one in which Great Britain and Argentina participated. Amber, Havoc, Hei, and his sister Bai, were involved in the War and were adversely affected by the Heaven's Gate's sudden disappearance. The area (within the 1500 km radius) around the gate became inaccessible. Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate are located on opposite ends of the globe, and are considered exact opposites of each other. PANDORA (Physical Alteration Natural Deconstruction Organized Research Agency) :A UN-operated research facility dedicated to studying the phenomena of Hell's Gate. Located on the edge of the Gate within the walls, an international team of scientists examine the properties of the gate via manned and unmanned expeditions within. Paranormal phenomena akin to ghosts are common here, likely due to the lab's close proximity to the Gate. Though run by the UN, it is not impervious to intelligence agencies; both the Syndicate and CIA have infiltrated almost every level of the research center. PANDORA has a heavily armed security force, consisting of armed soldiers possibly of various nationalities and armored vehicles, meant to protect its facilities and personnel. ; :Contractors are individuals who have gained supernatural powers due to the appearance of the Hell's and Heaven's Gates. In Kuro no Keiyakusha Gaiden, it is revealed that Contractors are defects that emerge when humans are unable to become Dolls. The existence of Contractors is kept a secret from the general public by most governments around the world, but they are well-known to the higher echelons of society and in the criminal underworld. Contractors possess two other traits that give them a rather sinister reputation: the need to perform remuneration, which is a bizarre, obsessive compulsive \\"payment\\" for the use of their powers, and a generally pragmatic, Machiavellian world view. This is described by the Contractors themselves as a lack of emotion in general, but not much evidence exists to verify this claim. Many Contractors exhibit at least some forms of emotion, including love, joy, guilt, and sorrow. :Later in the series it is explicitly revealed that Contractors are capable of experiencing emotions, but that those feelings do not play a prominent role in their thought processes. They are described as being totally rational, and totally amoral. The general rules seem to be that they feel no guilt, and they cannot form or retain social bonds. A normal Contractor cares, in essence, only about their own well-being, and everything is reduced to a cost/benefit analysis: any other issues like laws, emotions, or the question of the sanctity of human life are irrelevant to them. ; :Emotionless \\"mediums\\" created to mimic the forms of humans. Dolls can form a variety of functions; the most commonly seen in the series is their use of \\"observer spirits\\", which serve as reconnaissance. Dolls have different mediums through which they can send their observer spirits and must be in contact with this medium while observing; for example, Yin's medium is water, through which she can send her observer spirit anywhere else there is water. A Doll can also act as the perfect sleeper agent. It can be given the memories and personality of another person and assume a person's personality perfectly, mimicking all their habits, dreams, and feelings until the time is right. A Doll by the name of Shinoda Chiaki seemed to have some \\"life\\" of her own by saving Hei from being killed by another Contractor. This suggests that Dolls, like Chiaki, can go beyond their \\"set\\" characteristics and become \\"something else\\". Other examples include when Huang discovers Yin crying, when Yin hugs Huang when saying goodbye, July expressing confidence in himself and November 11 as a team, July staying with Suoh of his own choice, and Sakurai, a Doll stolen by the yakuza, smiling as she runs away with one of the yakuza who fell in love with her. ; :An intermediate between a Contractor and a Doll. Moratoria appear to be people with Contractor powers who do not require remuneration as part of their power. Unlike Contractors, they do not have control of their powers, shifting into a hypnotic state of unconsciousness as they use them. Moratoria also suffer from severe mental trauma as a result of their power. According to Mao, the chance of a Moratorium morphing into a Contractor is near-zero, but possible. ; :A Contractor who loses their powers in exchange for a flicker of hope for a normal life. There are very few known Forfeiters, and the way one becomes a Forfeiter is also unknown. Havoc became a Forfeiter after Heaven's Gate went missing. A Forfeiter can regain their powers if they get close to another gate. ; :An object coveted by many intelligence agencies and organizations, and once held at PANDORA. It seems to be connected to the appearance of Hell's Gate; however, PANDORA does not believe that it is of much importance as they had already discovered a similar substance in South America before Heaven's Gate disappeared. Its appearance resembles a large lens, and when inside the Hell's Gate, it displays a synchrotron light, which is yet to be explained. The Meteor Fragment was first stolen by Nick for the CIA. It was then stolen by Hei who infiltrated the PANDORA installation by orders from the Syndicate. It was then obtained by Amber, who holds it to this day. This object allows entities which do not exist (such as ghosts) to appear, and also allows entities which exist to disappear. ; :True to their names, all Contractors must \\"pay the price\\" for using their powers, whether they wish to or not. Moreover, it seems that the amount of payment required is dependent on how much the Contractor uses his/her power. Although this payment can be delayed, especially in the midst of combat, it is ultimately unavoidable. Each Contractor has a unique remuneration, reflecting the chaotic nature of the Hell's Gate. The cost is performing an action, different for each Contractor, ranging from the mundane to the bizarre (some examples include baking, eating boiled eggs, or breaking one's own finger). Not all contractors dislike their remuneration, and at least one uses it in conjunction with his own ability. :It is also possible for a Contractor to fully pay off his Contract, but this is an incredibly rare feat, requiring a drastic and traumatic sacrifice. In the series, it has only been seen to happen in those Contractors who have the ability to swap bodies, where their contract requires them to eventually lose their original body as remuneration.

He was fatally shot by Korean American activists, Jang In-hwan and Jeon Myeong-un, one of the first acts of nationalist rebellion by pro-Korean activists in the United States. The territory under Stevens' jurisdiction, within the Japanese government, would later be liberated at the cost of 12,000 Soviet lives and 21,000 Japanese lives, in the Battle of Manchuria during World War 2. Stevens' assassination took place at the same time as numerous other pro-Korean demonstrations, largely as a reaction to the 1905 treaty that established Korea as a colony of Japan. Itō Hirobumi (the Japanese Resident-General) was also assassinated, crowds in Korea attacked and burned down a pro-Japanese newspaper office, and crowds also clashed with Japanese guards at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Early life and career Stevens grew up in Washington, D.C. He enrolled as an undergraduate at Ohio's Oberlin College, from which he graduated in 1871; he then returned to his hometown to study law at Columbian University and Howard University, and was admitted to the bar association of the District of Columbia in 1873 in a class with Joseph E. Lee, Jacksonville, Florida's first black lawyer, Henry Wagner, US Consul at Lyons, France, William E. Matthews, John S. Leary, J. H. Smith, and John A. Moss.Hon Joseph E.

Grant appointed him secretary of the United States Legation at Tokyo, where he served under then-United States minister to Japan John Bingham. He enthusiastically accepted his new position, in part due to his fondness for learning new languages; he had previously studied Latin, Greek, French, and German. He was initially one of only three staff members at the Legation. He served as secretary until July 1883, and also took up the post of Charge d'Affairs ad interim in 1878–79, while Bingham was on home leave. After resigning his post, he returned to the United States. Working for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs In November 1883, Stevens entered the service of the Japanese Government as English Secretary to the Imperial Legation at Washington, a position which he obtained thanks to the influence his former superior Bingham had with the Japanese government. In 1884 he was ordered to Tokyo for service in the Foreign Office. In the winter of 1884–85 he accompanied Count Inoue Kaoru to Korea to assist in negotiations related to the murder of several Japanese citizens on Korean soil; for services rendered on that occasion, the Emperor Meiji awarded him with the Third Class of the Order of the Rising Sun. He was Bureau du Protocole of an 1885-87 Tokyo conference aimed at the renegotiation of unequal treaties imposed on Japan by Western countries; following the conference, he returned to Washington, D.C. with the rank of Honorary Counsellor of Legation. He served under Count Mutsu Munemitsu, then-Minister at Washington; during that time, he assisted in the negotiation of the treaty with Mexico, which was the first treaty made by Japan fully recognizing her right to exercise all the sovereign powers of an independent state. Soon after the start of hostilities in the First Sino-Japanese War, Stevens published an article in the North American Review, in which he sought to justify the war by asserting that the \\"dry rot of Chinese conservatism\\" blocked Korea's development, and that a reduction of Chinese influence in Korea and a corresponding increase in Japanese power would result in social and commercial reform. For services rendered during the war, he received the Second Class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures. He travelled twice to Hawaii to represent Japanese interests there, once in 1901 and again in 1902. He was also decorated two more times by the Japanese government, the third time receiving the Second Class of the Order of the Rising Sun, and then in October 1904, the fourth time, being awarded the Grand Cross of the Sacred Treasure. Adviser to the Korean government In November 1904, Stevens was appointed as adviser to the Korean Foreign Office. The Japanese government had urged the Korean government to appoint him to this position on the basis of the 1901 recommendation of Horace Allen. Stevens ignored several requests that a Korean consul be appointed in Hawaii; despite this, in 1905, Allen also commended Stevens to F.M. Swanzy, president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association; Swanzy was interested in seeing Korean emigration to Hawaii restarted. The Japanese government expected that Stevens supported their efforts to block Korean emigration to Hawaii, but he was initially open to the idea. He had several meetings with Swanzy in Tokyo in mid-1905 on the subject, but in the end, Swanzy's efforts were unsuccessful. Later that year, he issued a statement that Japan would welcome legislation restricting the entry of Japanese immigrants into the United States, and that they were also in favor of stopping movement to Hawaii, \\"provided it can be done in a manner that would not be offensive to Japan or that would not affect her dignity\\"; he stated that the Japanese government hoped to induce potential emigrants to settle in Korea or northeast China instead. While officially under the employ of the Joseon government, he purportedly continued to receive tens of thousands of dollars in payments from the Japanese in order to \\"advance Japanese propaganda\\" among the American people, according to South Korea's Ministry of Patriots' and Veterans' Affairs. In early 1906, Stevens made a bet with Kiuchi Jūshirō, a Japanese official resident in Korea, about the length of time before Japan would annex Korea. Kiuchi expected it would only take three years; Stevens' guess of five years would prove to be more nearly correct, as the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty was signed in mid-1910. However, Stevens would not survive to see his prediction come true. Assassination Stevens returned to the United States in March 1908 to visit his family in Washington, D.C. and vacation with his sisters at a cottage they owned in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Upon his arrival, he gave an interview with a San Francisco newspaper in which he stated that the common people of Korea were benefiting from the increasing Japanese presence and protection in their country, and that, in the state that Korea was in, Korea was not fit to be a liberated country. These statements provoked the ire of two local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Independence Club, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that something had to be done about Stevens. On March 22, 1908, four Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a man by the name of Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper, and whether \\"Japanese were not killing off the Koreans\\". He answered yes to the first question and no to the second, then proceeded to tell Lee that he had \\"probably been too long away from his country to know the exact condition of the Government.\\" Upon this, the four men began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him to strike his head against the marble flooring; Stevens backed up against the wall until help arrived. After the assault, Lee was quoted as saying, \\"We are all very sorry that we did not do more to him.\\" The following day, Jang In- hwan and Jeon Myeong-un, both Korean immigrants to the United States, approached Stevens at the Port of San Francisco as he prepared to catch a ferry to make a rail connection in Oakland and attacked him. Jeon fired his revolver at Stevens first, but missed, and instead rushed at him, using his weapon as a club to hit Stevens in the face. However, Jeon was quickly subdued by Stevens. Jang, who was also seeking to assassinate Stevens, saw the fight and then fired into the melee, striking Stevens twice in the back; Jeon was also shot in the confusion. The crowd which had gathered urged that they be lynched on the spot; Jang was arrested and held without bail on a charge of murder, while Jeon was first hospitalized, and later charged as an accessory. In newspaper interviews after the attack, both Jeon and Jang offered no apology for the assassination, describing Stevens as a \\"traitor to Korea\\" and stating that \\"thousands of people have been killed through his plans\\". One bullet had penetrated Stevens' lung, while another lodged in his groin; however, surgeons at the St. Francis Hospital initially expected that he would be able to make a recovery, and on the day of the attack he was apparently in good enough health to issue a statement to the press that the assault was \\"evidently the work of a small band of student agitators in and about San Francisco, who resent the fact that the Japanese have a protectorate over Korea and believe that I am to some extent responsible for this condition of affairs in their country\\". However, his condition began to deteriorate on the morning of March 25. His doctors, seeing signs of inflammation in his wounds, placed him under anesthesia and began to perform surgery at six that evening. He never regained consciousness after that, and died shortly after 11 PM, with Japanese Consul Chozo Koike at his bedside. He was buried in his hometown of Washington, D.C. after a funeral service at St. John's Episcopal Church; Secretary of State Elihu Root was among his pallbearers. Reaction to death News of Stevens' assassination was greeted with sorrow in diplomatic circles in Japan and among American missionaries in Korea, to whom Stevens was well known; United States Ambassador to Japan Thomas O'Brien was quoted as saying that \\"the utmost grief is expressed by everyone\\", adding that he counted Stevens as a \\"true and useful friend\\". Yale University professor George Trumbull Ladd, in a letter to the editor of The New York Times, denounced the attacks as \\"cowardly and shockingly brutal\\", calling Koreans a \\"bloody race\\" and, comparing the Stevens case to a number of other assaults in Korea, such as that against American missionary George Heber Jones, concluded that politically motivated murders were not \\"an isolated or at all peculiar experience\\" in Korea, and stated that the events \\"furnish an instructive object lesson for the correct estimation of the Korean character and the Korean method of self-government\\". Jang and Jeon both stood trial for Stevens' murder separately, as there was insufficient evidence to prove they had conspired with each other; Jeon was quickly acquitted of charges. The Korean community hired three lawyers to defend Jang, among whom one, Nathan Coughlan, eventually agreed to take on the case pro bono. During the trial, he planned to use Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of \\"patriotic insanity\\" to argue that Jang was not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found Jang guilty of second- degree murder on 23 December of that same year. Later Korean accounts describe Stevens as a traitor to Korea and refer to Jeon and Jang as patriots and heroes.

It flew for the first time in 1935, and entered service with the Peruvian Air Force in 1937, and with the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) in January 1938. A proposed variant with more powerful engines designated the Caproni Ca.325 was built only in mock-up form. Origins General Valle (Chief of Staff of the Regia Aeronautica) initiated the \\"R-plan\\" – a program designed to modernize Italy's air force, and to give it a strength of 3,000 aircraft by 1940. In late 1934 a competition was held for a bomber with the following specifications: * Speed: at and at . * Rate of climb: in minutes. * Range: with a bombload. * Ceiling: . The ceiling and range specifications were not met, but the speed was exceeded by almost all the machines entered. At the end of the competition, the \\"winners\\" were the Ca.135 (with 204 aircraft ordered), the Fiat BR.20 (204), the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 (96), the CANT Z.1007 (49), and the Piaggio P.32 (12). This array of aircraft was proof of the anarchy, clientelism, and inefficiency that afflicted the Italian aviation industry. Worse was the continuous waste of resources by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force). Orders were given for aircraft that were already obsolete. The winners of the competition were not always the best – the BR.20 was overlooked in favour of the SM.79, an aircraft which was not even entered in the competition. Design 300px The Ca.135 was to be built at Caproni's main Taliedo factory in Milan, which is why the type had a designation in the main Caproni sequence, rather than in the Caproni-Bergamaschi Ca.300 series. However, the project was retained at Ponte San Pietro and the prototype, completed during 1934–35 (a long construction time for the period), was first flown on 1 April. The project chief was Cesare Pallavicino of CAB (Caproni Aereonautica Bergamasca). Although the new bomber was in the \\"century series\\" of Caproni aircraft, it resembled the Caproni Ca.310, with its rounded nose, two engines, low-slung fuselage and wings with a very long chord. Several versions were fitted with different engines and some had noticeable performance differences. The prototype was powered by two (at 4,000 m/13,123 ft) Isotta Fraschini Asso XI.RC radial engines initially fitted with two bladed wooden propellers. It had a length of , a wingspan of , and a wing surface of . It weighed empty and had a useful load. Structurally, it was built of mixed materials, with a stressed-skin forward fuselage and a wood and fabric-covered steel-tube rear section; the wings being of metal and wood, using fabric and wood as a covering. The wings were more than of the total length, and had two spars of wooden construction, covered with plywood and metal. The strength coefficient was 7.5. The tail surfaces were built of wood covered with metal and plywood. The fuel system, with two tanks in the inner wings, held a total of 2,200 L (581 US gal). The Ca.135's fuselage shape was quite different from, for example, that of the Fiat BR.20. If the latter resembled the American B-25 Mitchell, the Ca.135, with its low fuselage more resembled the American B-26 Marauder. Its long nose accommodated the bomb-aimer (bombardier) and a front turret (similar to the Piaggio P.108 and later British bombers). The front part of the nose was detachable to allow a quick exit from the aircraft. It also had two doors in the cockpit roof, giving the pilots the chance to escape in an emergency. The right-hand seat could fold up to assist entry to the nose. A single 12.7 mm (0.5 in) in a turret in mid-fuselage, was manned by the co-pilot. A seat for the flight engineer was later fitted. The wireless operator's station, in the aft fuselage, was fitted with the AR350/AR5 (the standard for Italian bombers), a radiogoniometer (P63N), an OMI AGR.90 photographic-planimetric machine or the similar AGR 61. The aircraft was also equipped with an APR 3 camera which although not fixed, was normally operated through a small window. The wireless operator also had a 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine gun in the ventral position. All this equipment made him very busy; as a result, an extra man was often carried. The aircraft had very wide glazed surfaces in the nose, cockpit, and the central and aft fuselage; much more than in other Italian aircraft. The aircraft was fitted with three machine guns: two 12.7 mm (0.5 in) calibre in the upper turret rsp. belly-stand and one 7.7 mm (0.303 in) calibre gun in the nose. All had 500 rounds, except the 7.7 mm (0.303 in) which had 350. Bombload, like most Italian bombers, was less than impressive in terms of total weight, but was relatively flexible, depending on the role – from anti-ship to close air support: * 2 × 800 kg (1,760 lb) bombs (the heaviest in the Regia Aeronautica), plus 2 × 50 kg (110 lb), and 2 × 31 kg (68 lb), for a total of 1,862 kg (4,105 lb) * 2 × 500 kg (1,100 lb) + 4 × 100 kg (220 lb) + 2 × 31 kg (68 lb), total nominal 1,462 kg (3,223 lb) * 4 × 250 kg (550 lb) * 8 × 100 kg (220 lb) + 8 × 50 kg (110 lb) + 4 × 31 kg (68 lb), total 1,324 kg (2,919 lb) * 16 × 50 kg (110 lb) + 8 × 31 kg (68 lb), total 1,048 kg (2,310 lb) * 24 × 31 kg (68 lb), 20 kg (40 lb), 15 kg (33 lb), or 12 kg (26 lb). * 120 × 1 kg (2 lb) or 2 kg (4 lb) bomblets * 2 × torpedoes (never used, but hardpoints were fitted) The aircraft had a better bomb capacity than most of its contemporaries (the SM.79 could carry: 2 × 500 kg/1,100 , 5 × 250 kg/550 lb, 12 × 100 kg/220 lb or 50 kg/110 lb bombs, or 700 × 1–2 kg/2-4 lb bomblets). Performance The aircraft was underpowered, with a maximum speed of at and a high minimum speed of , (there were no slats, and maybe not even flaps). Ceiling was only and the endurance, at 70% of throttle, was . All-up weight was too high, with total of , not as expected. The total payload of was shared between the crew (320+ kg/705+ lb), weapons (200 kg/441 lb), radios and other equipment (100 kg/220 lb), fuel (2,200 L/581 US gal), oil (1,500 kg/3,307 lb), oxygen and bombs. There was almost no chance of carrying a full load of fuel with the maximum bombload, (other Italian bombers were generally capable of a 3,300–3,600 kg/7,275-7,937 lb payload). The lack of power made take-offs when over-loaded, impossible. Indeed, even with a normal load, take-offs were problematic. Take-off and landing distances were and . The range was good enough to assure with 550 kg (1,210 lb) and with 1,200 kg (2,650 lb). The production version was fitted with two inline liquid- cooled Asso XI RC.40 engines, each giving at 4,000 m (13,120 ft). Aerodynamic drag was reduced, with three-bladed metal propellers that were theoretically more efficient. These new engines gave the aircraft a maximum speed of at 4,000 m (13,120 ft). It could climb to 2,000 m (6,560 ft) in 5.5 minutes, 4,000 m (13,120 ft) in 12.1 minutes and 5,000 m (16,400 ft) in 16.9 minutes. Despite this, the aircraft was still underpowered, so the 1939 Ca.135Mod, fitted with Piaggio P.XI engines, was developed. Operational service The aircraft arrived late in respect to the others (like the BR.20), and with totally unsatisfactory technology. Despite this there was an order for 32 aircraft from the Regia Aeronautica on 19 June 1937. They started to enter service in January 1938, over a year after the BR and SM bombers. Spanish Civil War In 1938 seven aircraft were earmarked for the Aviazione Legionaria to serve in the Spanish Civil War. These Tipo Spagna (\\"Spanish Type\\") aircraft were refitted with Fiat A.80 R.C.41 engines, rated at . Crews from 11 Wing were sent to Taliedo (just outside Milan), to take the first seven aircraft – designated Ca.135S – to Spain. One was damaged on take-off, the other six flew to Ciampino near Rome, where two suffered damage on landing. After repairs and some modifications, the seven aircraft were not ready to leave for Spain until late 1938. During the flight two were forced by icing to return to Italy and three crashed into the sea. Only two arrived at Palma de Mallorca, where they remained unused for six months. Italy Production of the aircraft was initially 32 aircraft, of which eight were Ca.135Ss, some were converted into the Ca.135Mod. The first Ca.135Bis were built in 1938. They were fitted with 746 kW (1,000 hp) Piaggio P.XI RC.40 engines, with Piaggio P.1001 three-blade metal propellers. Length was 17.7 m (58.1 ft), wingspan 18.8 m (61.7 ft), and wing surface 60 m (646 ft). Armament was still only two 12.7 mm (0.5 in) guns and one 7.7 mm (0.303 in), but the nose was redesigned to be more aerodynamic. Another 32 aircraft were ordered and built between 1939 and June 1940. They were not successful aircraft, being heavily criticized by the Italian pilots. Unable to be used operationally, they were sent to flying schools, and then exported to Hungary. The first batch of Ca.135s flown by 11 Wing were phased out by late 1938. 25 were still available at Jesi airfield, but only four were airworthy. The others were probably in maintenance for engine replacement. There were at least 15 Ca.135Ss and Ca.135Mods at the Malpensa flying school in 1940, the poor condition of these aircraft meant that they were scrapped in November 1941. With the scrapping of the first batch and the selling of the second, all 64 Ca.135s left the service of the Regia Aeronautica without performing a single operational mission. Hungary A Ca.135 of the Hungarian Air Force in 1942. In the 1938 Imperial Japanese Army Air Force evaluation, the Ca.135 P.XI had lost to the Fiat BR.20, but the Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő (MKHL; the Royal Hungarian Air Force), Hungarian Air Force nonetheless ordered it. They were delivered 1940 and 1942 in two series of 36 rsp. 31 (originally 32, but one plane was lost on the delivery flight) planes. Also a licence production of aircraft and engines was considered. The Hungarians operated a total of 67 Ca.135bis with some success against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front in 1941 and 1942, once Hungary had committed its forces in that sector during World War II. These aircraft constituted almost the entire Hungarian heavy bomber force. They were ordered after Hungarians returned 33 out of 36 Caproni Ca.310s acquired between May and September 1939. Because of an Italian credit for 300 million lire and the impossibility of acquiring modern German aircraft, Honvéd air force acquired the new, more powerful, Ca.135bis. They were ordered in Dec 1939.Neulen 2000, p. 121. After that \\"deal\\" the first charge was delivered in May/June 1940, the second one in May 1942 (from a second order submitted in July 1941). Regia Aeronautica had rejected the Ca.135s on account of its technical shortcomings and the aircraft had been taken off production. But in Hungarian service this bomber proved quite satisfactory.Neulen 2000, p. 121. When Hungary declared war to the Soviet Union, in June 1941, Honvéd air force was almost entirely equipped with Italian aircraft.Neulen 2000, p. 121. The bombers had their baptisme of fire on 27 June 1941, the day of Hungarian declaration of war. That day, 1st Lt Istvan Szakonyi, on his Ca.135 from the 4/III Bomber Group, managed to destroy an important bridge with a 'trial drop' of two bombs.Neulen 2000, p. 124. The Ca.135s equipped the 3./III Group of 3rd Bomber Wing, based in Debrecen, a bomber unit of the Hungarian air formation commanded by Lt Col Béla Orosz, that had been tasked to provide air support to the Hungarian Rapid Corps, subordinated to German 17th Army.Neulen 2000, pp. 124–125. On 11 August, six Capronis, commanded by 1st Lt Szakonyi, took off to bomb a 2 km (6,560 ft) bridge across the Bug River of the city of Nikolayev, on the Black sea. One Ca.135 had to turn back due to engine problems, but the other five, escorted by Hungarian Fiat CR.42s and Reggiane Re.2000s, continued eastwards. Szakonyi's Caproni was hit by AA fire and lost his port engine but the squadron commander remained in action. One of his pilots, Capt. Eszenyi, destroyed the bridge, and Szakonyi bombed the Nikolayev train station. On the way back the Capronis were intercepted by Soviet Polikarpov I-16 fighters. The escorting Hungarian fighters shot down five I-16, while the crippled Szakonyi's Ca.135 managed to destroy another three Polikarpovs. After the German 11th Army captured Nikolayev, on 16 August, the commander of Luftflotte 4, Col Gen Lohr, decorated the successful Hungarian crews at Sutyska.Neulen 2000, pp. 125–126. The Ca.135 on the Eastern front had frequent malfunctions and its insufficient combat load-carrying capability set high demands on the mechanics maintaining it. A 50 per cent operational readiness of the Capronis was to be seen as a great achievement.Neulen 2000, p. 121. The first Hungarian Flying formation on the Eastern Front was withdrawn in September 1941, for recuperation, re-equipment and rest. In June 1942 the Hungarians sent the 2nd Air Brigade to provide tactical support and reconnaissance sorties to Hungarian 2nd Army, deployed on the Don. The only bombardment unit, the 4/1 Bomber squadron, was equipped with 17 Ca.135s.Neulen 2000, pp. 126–127. A Hungarian Air Force Ca.135 being loaded with bombs, 1942. The 4° squadron operated these aircraft until late 1942, when the survivors, worn out, were used as training aircraft. The Hungarians did not love the Ca.135Bis, but it was all they had, and so they had to make best out of it. One of the squadrons, the I/4, (originally equipped with eight aircraft), soon lost one on landing. It was replaced by another four aircraft. This squadron, up to October 1941, carried out 265 attacks, flew 1,040 sorties, and dropped around 1,450 tonnes (1,600 tons) of bombs, evidently helped by the short range (200–300 km/120-190 mi) that allowed them to use the aircraft's maximum bomb load. Two aircraft were shot down, another two were lost in accidents and 11 crewmen were killed. The daily average, over these four months, was over 8 missions flown and 13 tonnes (14 tons) of bombs dropped. PeruDesign and production= Early in 1936, Capronis representative in Lima, Peru, approached the Peruvian Navy and Aviation Ministry regarding the possible Peruvian purchase of Ca.135 aircraft. Peru had been considering the replacement of its unsatisfactory Caproni Ca.111 bombers since 1935, and the Italian Air Ministry approved of the foreign sale of the Ca.135. Consequently, Peru ordered six Ca.135s from Caproni in May 1936. Peruvian Aviation Corps Commander Ergasto Silva Guillen led a Peruvian delegation to Italy to evaluate the Ca.135 and to ensure that there was no repeat of what Peruvians recall as the \\"Ca.111 fiasco\\". Caproni test pilot Ettore Wengi made a demonstration flight for the Peruvians which left Silva unimpressed; he viewed the Ca.135 as underpowered and lacking in defensive armament and wrote a letter to the Caproni company insisting on modifications to the aircraft and threatening to cancel the Peruvian order if they were not made. Caproni company founder Gianni Caproni (1886–1957) personally promised that the changes would be made.The Latin American Aviation Historical Society: South American Aviation: \\"The Caproni Bergamaschi Ca.135 in Peruvian Service\\" by Amaru Tincopa Gallegos. The resulting version of the aircraft, the Ca.135 Tipo Peru (\\"Peruvian Type\\"), had more powerful engines—Isotta Fraschini Asso XI R.C.40 Spinto (\\"Driven\\") engines, uprated versions of the Isotta Fraschini R.C.40 Asso (\\"Ace\\") delivering 559 kilowatts (750 horsepower) at sea level and 671 kilowatts (900 horsepower) at 4,000 meters (13,123 ft) – and modified engine cowlings with additional openings to accommodate the additional air intakes of the new engines. The new engines gave the Ca.135 better performance that met the Peruvian requirements, and also allowed an increase in the aircrafts bomb load to 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds). Defensive armament was improved by the installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5-inch) machine gun in a semi-open dorsal turret equipped with a wind deflector shield to protect the gunner and another 12.7-millimeter machine gun in a retractable ventral turret.The Latin American Aviation Historical Society: South American Aviation: \\"Those Peruvian Ca. 135s\\" by Dan Hagedorn\\". Both turrets had a 360-degree field of fire, although the ventral turret produced excessive aerodynamic drag when extended and was recommended for use only in emergencies. All six Ca.135 Tipo Peru aircraft were completed in early July 1937. After test flights by Wengi and acceptance by the Peruvian delegation, they were disassembled and shipped to Callao, Peru. Personnel of the Caproni companys Peruvian subsidiary, Caproni Peruana S.A., promptly began their reassembly at Las Palmas. The first Ca.135 was reassembled within two weeks, and the first flights in Peru took place when the six bombers were turned over to the Peruvian Aviation Corps new 2nd Heavy Bomber Squadron on 10 September 1937. =Operational service= After their pilots had undergone two months of intensive training by Italian officers, five 2nd Heavy Bomber Squadron Ca.135s flew to their permanent base, the Lieutenant Commander Ruiz base, at Chiclayo, Peru, on 5 November 1937, while the sixth bomber remained at Las Palmas to train additional personnel. Once at Chiclayo, the five Ca.135s became the 2nd Bombardment Group, joining the Ca.111 bombers of the 1st Bombardment Group as part of the 1st Aviation Squadron. In 1940 a reorganization resulted in the Ca.135s being assigned to the 13th, 14th, and 15th Escuadrillas alongside Ca.111 bombers, although later in the year the Ca.111s were reclassified as transport aircraft and reassigned to transport squadrons, at which point the 14th and 15th Ecuadrillas were disbanded and all Ca.135s were assigned to the 13th Escuadrilla. In service, the Ca.135 Tipo Peru soon came under criticism, with Peruvian pilots complaining that the bombers yawed to the right on take-off and had poor lateral stability; in addition, their engines proved unreliable in service, and the bombers suffered an excessive number of oil and hydraulic leaks. Caproni Peruana S.A. noted these problems and made plans to correct them in a version of the Ca.135 to be manufactured in Peru, although in the end no Ca.135s were built in Peru. As the result of a growing border crisis with Ecuador in 1941, the bomber squadrons of the Peruvian Aviation Corps were ordered into operational readiness, although engine problems kept them from having more than two aircraft out of each squadron's assigned five bombers airworthy at any given time. However, the Peruvian bombers were able to train at a bombing range north of Chiclayo. When the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War broke out on 5 July 1941, the Ca.135s remained behind at the Lieutenant Commander Ruiz base while other bombers moved to forward airfields, the greater range of the Ca.135s allowing them to avoid the need to move to forward air bases. However, Peruvian bombing missions were limited to tactical attacks on Ecuadorian troops in the front lines and facilities and forces supporting them directly, a type of attack to which Ca.135s were unsuited. Instead, the Ca.135s conducted unescorted reconnaissance flights over Ecuadorian territory and transport flights to the airfields at Piura and Talara, Peru. On 10 July 1941, during a transport flight, one of the Ca.135s was forced down by engine problems in an area inaccessible to ground vehicles about from Piura; although suffering only minor damage, its disassembly for transportation to a repair facility was infeasible, so it was stripped and abandoned. After the war ended on 31 July 1942, the five surviving Ca.135s remained at Chiclayo. They soon were removed from service, disassembled, and carted away on flatbed trucks driven by American military personnel from El Pato airbase. By October 1942, the last of the Peruvian Ca.135s had disappeared. Although they are rumored to have been burned in the desert or buried somewhere around the El Pato air base, their final fate is unrecorded. Modified aircraft A single Ca.135 P.XI was modified by Caproni. It incorporated a dihedral tailplane and 1,044 kW (1,400 hp) Alfa Romeo 135 RC.32 Tornado radial engines, and given the designation Ca.135 bis/Alfa. The newer and more powerful engines pushed the maximum speed of the aircraft to more than 480 km/h (300 mph). The final variant was also a one-off, known as the Ca.135 Raid. It was used to set records and win air races. It was built in 1937 to the order of the Brazilian pilot de Barros. It was powered by two Isotta Fraschini Asso XI and provided with additional fuel capacity for a greatly extended range. While attempting a flight from Italy to Brazil in 1937, de Barros and the Ca.135 Raid disappeared over North Africa, in another disaster for the image of the aircraft.

Al- Khasawneh in Northern Jordan At the time of the Ottoman Empire, Northern Jordan was a sanjak (administrative division) of the town of Ajloun. The Al- Khasawneh appeared in the second part of the 16th century in Ein Al-Sharah in the mountainous part of Ajloun where they were engaged in constant clashes with bedouin tribes and other local forces before becoming a dominant group in the area known as Al-Asar district (nahiyah, Ajloun). An Ottoman document of 1757 records that their sheikh Musa Al-Hamad was the sheikh of the Banu Obaid group and responsible for contributing to the protection of the annual pilgrimage caravan or hajj to Mecca- a highly lucrative and sought after office. Later on, this part of Al-Asar district was renamed the Banu Obaid district in a classic case of a newcomer group giving their own name to a geographic area. It continues to be known by that name and the Al-Khasawneh are the traditional hereditary sheikhs of the district, although the Nuseirat clan have competed with them at times for the sheikhdom of the district. In the second part of the 18th century, well-known rebel Zahir al-Umar, of Galilee and later Acre extended his rule to the Ajloun area through his son Ahmad al-Zahir. The Ottomans, preoccupied with their war against Russia that ended with the Kunuk Kenarcha treaty of 1775, had no choice but to acquiesce to Zahir's territorial expansion. In conjunction with his bedouin allies, Musa Al-Hamad led a number of battles against Zahir and his son, but was later appointed a member of a consultative group of sheikhs by Ahmad, son of Zahir, who nevertheless remained suspicious of his intentions. When Ahmad was informed in the early 1770s that Musa was trying to raise a revolt against him, he invited Musa to his citadel at Tubna in the Koura district of Ajloun, where he was killed after dinner. After 1775 the Ottomans, now free to tackle Zahir, sent both Hussein Pasha and Ahmad beik, later Pasha, El-Jazzar against Zahir, who was killed, signalling the beginning of a revolt in Ajloun where the Al-Khasawneh and their allies attacked the citadel of Tubna. In the event, Ahmad, son of Zahir, escaped to Palestine and threw himself on the mercy of Ottoman officials who took him to Istanbul. For Al-Khasawneh, who had stood firmly by the Ottomans, this proved an auspicious turn of events and soon Musa's two sons, Saleh and Musa II were able to regain their father's possessions and to move to the village of Husn where they and their descendants continued as the leading family in the area. Musa II also fought against Napoleon's army at the battle of Mount Tabor in northern Palestine, where the French were led by general Kléber and later by Napoleon himself. In 1869, the Khasawneh were asked by the Ottoman government to move out of Husn. Taking advantage of the situation, they gained possession of the villages of Idoun and Nu'eima along with six or seven ruined villages. These they were able to defend against marauding nomadic tribes and other forces and continue as one of the largest land owners in northern Jordan. The Ottomans introduced a system of elected local government in the 1860s in what was known as the council of Ajloun, with representation from the old prominent clans of Ajloun with the Al-Khasawneh always having an elected member. This was part of a larger process taking place all over the Middle East whereby the Ottoman co- opted local forces into local and central government. Sub-branches The different branches of the clan are: Al Homoud, Al- Nawasir, Al-Musa, Al Essa, Al Nasser, Al Barakat, Al Hindawi, Al Musleh, Al Halalsheh, Al-Yousuf. A separate branch settled in the village of Beit Guvrin in Palestine, and is today called \\"Al-Azzah.\\" There is also another part of the Al-Azzah clan that settled in Iraq, which is known as the Azzawi clan.

Owned by Lazer Broadcasting, the station airs a regional Mexican music format. KZER is simulcast on FM translator K293CK (106.5 FM) in Santa Barbara. History=KTMS The station at the 1250 kHz frequency in Santa Barbara first signed on October 31, 1937 as KTMS, originally at 1220 kHz and powered at 500 watts. It was founded by Santa Barbara News-Press publisher Thomas More Storke (hence the station call sign). KTMS was an NBC Blue Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas, and big band broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio. Among the programs produced at the station was 1-2-5 Club, which debuted in 1937 and was hosted by disc jockey Bob Ruth for many years. In 1941, KTMS moved to the 1250 AM frequency, where the call letters would stay for 57 years. The move was coupled with a power increase to 1,000 watts. When the Blue Network became ABC in 1945, KTMS maintained its affiliation while also carrying shows from the Mutual Broadcasting System and the Don Lee Network. On December 1, 1956, KTMS replaced KDB as the Santa Barbara affiliate of Don Lee. In March 1964, Storke sold News-Press Publishing to Robert McLean, owner of the Philadelphia Bulletin, for an undisclosed amount; the radio station was valued at $350,000. The new owner of KTMS acquired KRCW (97.5 FM) the following year and changed its call sign to KTMS-FM. At first the FM station mostly simulcast programs heard on 1250 AM but later became separately programmed with a beautiful music format. In 1985, KTMS-FM became top 40 outlet KHTY. News-Press Publishing's cross-ownership of KTMS-AM-FM predated the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 1975 rules prohibiting a person or entity from owning both a newspaper and a radio or television station in the same media market. The company's mix of media outlets was allowed to remain intact. KTMS adopted a middle of the road music format in the mid-1970s. By 1983, the station became a full-time news/talk outlet. On July 12, 1985, News-Press Publishing sold KTMS and its FM counterpart, then known as KKOO-FM, to F&M; Broadcasting for $2 million. This transaction marked the end of KTMS' common ownership with the News-Press after nearly five decades. In January 1996, Engles Enterprises, Inc. purchased KTMS and KHTY for $2 million. KEYT In September 1998, Engles sold KTMS for $1.6 million to Smith Broadcasting, owner of the local ABC television affiliate KEYT-TV (channel 3). Smith immediately launched an all-news format on 1250 AM with new call letters KEYT to match those of its new TV sister. \\"KEYT 1250\\" featured news reports from the Associated Press and simulcasts of KEYT-TV newscasts. Meanwhile, the KTMS call sign and news/talk format moved to 990 AM. KZER KEYT 1250 was a financial drain on Smith Broadcasting from the beginning, losing $1 million over five years. In 2003, Smith sold the station to Lazer Broadcasting. Lazer changed the station's call letters to KZER and its format to regional Mexican.

Origins Henry Rolle was born circa 1589, the second son of Robert Rolle (d. 1633) of Heanton Satchville in the parish of Petrockstowe, Devon, by his wife Joan Hele, daughter of Thomas Hele of Fleet, Devon. Henry was a great-grandson, in a junior line, of George Rolle (c.1486-1552) of Stevenstone, Devon, founder of the influential and wealthy Rolle family of Devon, Keeper of the Records of the Court of Common Pleas and MP for Barnstaple in 1542 and 1545. His brothers included:Vivian, p.654 *Sir Samuel I Rolle (c.1588-1647) (eldest brother)Vivian, p.654 of Heanton Satchville, Member of Parliament for Callington, Cornwall in 1640 and for Devon 1641-1647 and a supporter of the parliamentary side in the Civil War. *John Rolle (1598–1648) (younger brother) a Turkey Merchant and MP for Callington, Cornwall, in 1626 and 1628 and for Truro, Cornwall, in 1640 for the Short Parliament and in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. A supporter of the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil War Early legal career He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 20 March 1607, and was admitted on 1 February 1609 to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1618. He was elected bencher in 1633 and reader in 1637 and 1638, but owing to the prevalence of the plague, did not give his reading until Lent 1639. Among his contemporaries at the Inner Temple and his intimate friends were Sir Edward Littleton (1589–1645), afterwards lord keeper and created Baron Littleton; Sir Edward Herbert, afterwards attorney-general; Sir Thomas Gardiner, afterwards recorder of London; and John Selden, by whose conversation and friendly rivalry he profited in the study of the law and humane learning. Rolle practised with eminent success in the Court of King's Bench. He was appointed recorder of Dorchester in 1636, and was called to the degree of serjeant-at- law on 10 May 1640. Political career He served as MP for Callington, in Cornwall, between 1620 and 1624, during the last two parliaments of King James I (1603-1625), and for Truro between 1625 and 1629 in the first three parliaments of his successor King Charles I (1625-1649). He early identified himself with the popular party and was unsurpassed by any other member in his vigour to effect the impeachment of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and was likewise insistent that supply should be postponed to the redress of grievances. On the outbreak of the Civil War he took the side of Parliament, contributed £100 to the defence fund, and took the Covenant. Judicial career His advancement to a judgeship in the Court of King's Bench was one of the stipulations included in the propositions for peace of January 1642–3. On 28 October 1645 he was sworn in as such, and on 15 November 1648, further to votes of both houses of parliament, he was advanced to Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, otherwise known as Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench. About a week after the execution of King Charles I in 1649, he accepted on 8 February 1649, a new commission as Lord Chief Justice of the upper bench on the understanding that no change should be made to the fundamental laws of the kingdom. On 13 February 1649 he was voted a member of the Council of State, which appointment strengthened the government, and his presence on the western circuit contributed much to the settlement of the public mind. On 4 August 1654 he was appointed Commissioner of the Exchequer. Rolle was exceeded in his abilities as advocate or judge by none of his contemporaries save by the great Sir Matthew Hale. His decisions, reported by William Style, rarely relate to matters of historic interest. Nevertheless, he established, in the case of Captain Streater, committed to prison by order of the Council of State and the Speaker of the House of Commons for the publication of seditious writings, the principle that a court of justice cannot review parliamentary commitments if regular in form. Case of Don Pantaleone Sá Rolle's name is associated with a cause célèbre of international law. Don Pantaleone Sá, a brother of the Portuguese ambassador, was arrested for a murder committed in an affray in the New Exchange in the Strand, London. The fact was undeniable, but the Don claimed the privilege of exterritoriality, due to his being a member of the Ambassador's household. The point was discussed by Rolle in consultation with two of his puisne judges, two admiralty judges and two civilians, and on 16 January 1654 was decided against the Don. The decision was without precedent, for it could neither be denied that the Don was of the household of the ambassador, nor that the privilege of exterritoriality had theretofore been understood to extend even to cases of murder. At the trial on 6 July 1654, over which Rolle presided, the prisoner was conceded a jury, half English half Portuguese, but was denied the assistance of counsel and was compelled to waive his privilege and plead to the indictment by a threat of peine forte et dure. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. The execution was carried out on Tower Hill on 10 July 1654. On the outbreak of the Penruddock uprising on 12 March 1654–5, Rolle was at Salisbury on assize business, when he was surprised by the cavaliers under Sir Joseph Wagstaffe, who coolly proposed to hang him. At Penruddock's intercession, however, he was released. Resignation He served as one of the commissioners for the trial of the insurgents at Exeter in May 1655, and being unable to decide against the merchant George Cony, who had sued a customs officer for levying duty from him by force without authority of parliament, and rather than give further offence to the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell he resigned on 7 June 1655. He was succeeded by Sir John Glynne. Death and burial He died on 30 July 1656 and was buried in the parish church of his manor of Shapwick, near Glastonbury, in Somerset. Publications While engaged in the practice of law Rolle spent much of his leisure in making reports and abridgments of cases. His Abridgment des plusieurs Cases et Resolutions del Commun Ley, known as Rolle's Abridgment, was published in London in 1668 as two volumes folio. The preface includes an engraving of his portrait and is followed by a memoir by Sir Matthew Hale in which he is characterised as \\"a person of great learning and experience in the common law, profound judgment, singular prudence, great moderation, justice, and integrity\\". His Reports de divers Cases en le Court del Banke le Roy en le Temps del Reign de Roy Jacques, appeared in print in London in 1675–6, in two volumes folio.

Related to sexual slang is slang related to defecation and flatulence (toilet humor, scatolinguistics). References to the anal tract are often given a sexual connotation in the context of anal sex (in particular, in a context of male homosexuality). While popular usage is incredibly versatile in coining ever new short-lived synonyms, old terms with originally no pejorative colouring may come to be considered inappropriate over time. Thus, terms like arse/ass, cunt, cock and fuck should not be considered \\"slang,\\" since they are the inherited common English terms for their referents, but they are often considered vulgarisms and are replaced by euphemisms or scientific terminology in \\"polite\\" language. Pejorative usage Terms of disparagement are used to refer to members of a given sexual minority, gender, sex, or sexual orientation in a derogatory or pejorative manner. They are used as insults by persons who are not or do not wish to be associated with the group being disparaged. For example, queer can be used as an insult by those seeking to deprecate homosexual, bisexual, and transgender or transsexual people, but the word has also undergone reclaiming, such that it can be used positively within that community. Which terms are used as slurs is determined by a society's or subculture's set of values, especially its biases against genders (sexism). For example, words such as whore and slut are typically used to refer to sexually promiscuous women. Sexual slurs are common across many cultures and historical periods. The most common slurs directed against men historically include accusations of being a passive homosexual (Aristophanes notably enjoyed using such allusions) or of being effeminate; for example, in the Hittite military oath, oath-breakers are threatened with being made into women (a promise of either actual castration, or of divine revenge on the traitors' manhood). The pejorative term prick for a contemptible person is also usually used for men.Terry Victor, Tom Dalzell, The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, Routledge, Nov 27, 2014  Sexual slang and humor  In the popular jargon of many cultures, the use of sexual slang is a form of humor or euphemism that often creates controversy over its public use. Sexual humor has been seen in many circles as crude and unsophisticated, as well as insulting towards the subject it describes. Sexual slang has a long history in literature and comedy: examples from Shakespeare are well-known. The popularity of contemporary comedians who indulge in sexual humor, from George Carlin to Andrew Dice Clay, reflects the appeal of this form of speech. It is often seen as a form of taboo, in which much of the appeal lies in the shock value of daring to speak \\"forbidden\\" words in public.

It is approximately east of Ecclefechan, and north-east of Annan, on the banks of the Middlebie Burn. Middlebie Parish consists of the ancient parishes of Middlebie, Pennersax (Pennersaughs) and Carruthers, united in 1609. Middlebie was the seat of a Presbytery from some time after the Reformation until 1743. It was then divided to form the Presbyteries of Langholm and Annan. Middlebie parish is now in the Presbytery of Annandale & Eskdale. It is bounded by the parishes of Tundergarth, Langholm, Canonbie, Half Morton, Kirkpatrick Fleming, Annan and Hoddam. The villages of Eaglesfield, Middlebie and Waterbeck lie within the parish, with Kirtlebridge on its southern boundary. Eaglesfield and Hottsbridge by Waterbeck still have primary schools. The school at Middlebie closed in 1972 nearly a hundred years after it opened. The Eaglesfield building is now just over a hundred years old. The former school in Waterbeck village, built about 1900, is now the public hall. Eaglesfield's public hall was built in 1892-3. Middlebie's old hall (a wooden ex-army building purchased in 1928) was demolished and a new one built in 2001. The West Coast Main Line railway runs through the parish from London to Glasgow. Previously the Caledonian Railway, the line formerly had a station at Kirtlebridge, where the writer Thomas Carlyle would alight before walking up to his parents farm at Scotsbrig above Middlebie. From Kirtlebridge the Solway Junction Railway ran down to Annan and across by the Solway viaduct to Cumbria. It was built to transport iron ore to the Lanarkshire steelworks. In 1841 the population of the parish was 2,154 and about sixty of these people were handloom weavers. There were inns and shops and the Lime Works Blacketridge. Tradesmen listed in 1841 include joiners, shoemakers, tailors, cloggers, masons, millers, carters, grooms, gardeners, dressmakers, straw-hat makers, etc. Today, only Eaglesfield still has a general store and post office. In 1841, as well as 73 farmers, 314 people were employed as agricultural labourers and 60 more as servants.

He has been inducted into the Harness Racing Hall of Fame, the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Dunc Campbell and his father before him were Standardbred horsemen. Dunc had two sons Ray and Jack Campbell with his family near London, Ontario. Jack had two sons, John Campbell and Jim Campbell. Ray was a trainer/driver as well as his son Robert Campbell. Both John and Jim Campbell have established themselves in the upper echelon of harness racing, however many consider John Campbell the greatest reinsman of all-era's. Campbell's dollar purse earnings, exceed any currently active driver or jockey. John has won more dollars-in- purses at any North American Track (i. e, The Meadowlands Racetrack) than any jockey or driver. Campbell is considered by many to be the best driver in harness racing history. In 1976, harness racing was changed forever by the opening of the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Meadowlands, also known as the Big M, is a one-mile harness track which attracted the very best harness horses, trainers and drivers in North America. Entering the 1970s, harness races were mostly contested with the horses racing in single file until they reached the homestretch, where the real race began. Also, most horses were driven by their owners or trainers. When the Meadowlands opened, a new breed of driver emerged called the catch-driver. The catch-driver was usually younger, lighter and more athletic and was able to make the horses go faster than the previous generation of driver. Campbell was the dominant catch driver of the late 1970s and 1980s and well into the 1990s. Campbell was a pioneer in the development of the modern catch driver and today, most top drivers are catch drivers. He was the youngest driver ever elected into the U.S. Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1990 at age 35 and is also a member of the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the London (Ont.) Sports Hall of Fame in its inaugural class, 2002.

He was also posthumous father-in-law of King Albert II of the Belgians, and grandfather of King Philippe of Belgium. Family history Ademarus Rufus, who died in 1049, held the title of Comes in southern Italy. Siggerio Ruffo became Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II's grand marshal of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1235. The family divided into two branches after the 14th century: the Ruffo di Calabria and the Ruffo di Scaletta, to the former of which Fulco belonged.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser XVI. \\"Ruffo\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 2001, pp.522-529. . Don Fulco was the son of Fulco VII Beniamino Tristano Ruffo di Calabria, 5th Duke of Guardia Lombarda (1848–1901), and Laura Mosselman du Chenoy, a Belgian aristocrat, whose maternal grandfather was Count Jacques André Coghen, Belgium's second finance minister. Beniamino Ruffo di Calabria was the younger brother of the head of the House of Ruffo, Fulco Ruffo di Calabria-Santapau, 10th Principe di Scilla and 2nd Duca di Santa Cristina. Don Fulco was made, by decree of 15 March 1928, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, in the Kingdom of Italy. By inheritance he was also the 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda and 17th Count of Sinopoli. The family Ruffo di Calabria represents one of the most ancient lineages of Italy and includes Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo. Fulco was related to historically eminent Roman and southern Italian noble families, including the Colonna, Orsini, Pallavicini, Alliata and Rospigliosi. Among his distinguished ancestors of the French aristocracy were the Marquis de Lafayette, hero of American Independence, and the Dukes of Noailles. Since the fall of the Italian monarchy in 1947 the Princes Ruffo di Calabria have become connected by marriage to such formerly reigning dynasties as the Orléans, the Savoys, the Bonapartes and the mediatized family of Windisch-Graetz.de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. Coutant de Saisseval, Guy. Le Petit Gotha. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery, Paris 2002, p. 702 (French) Early life and prewar military service Fulco Ruffo di Calabria was born in Naples, Kingdom of Italy on 12 August 1884. His noble family's patriotism was prominent in Italian military history since at least 1797. He thus volunteered for reserve officer's training with the 11th Foggia Light Cavalry Regiment on 22 November 1904. On 31 May 1905, he was promoted to Caporal; on 30 November, he was again promoted, to Sergente. On 20 February 1906, he was commissioned into officers' ranks as a Sottotenente. Subsequently, he became deputy director of the Belgian Wegimont shipping company's African station. He returned from Africa as World War I broke out.Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory.

World War I service Displayed here is Ruffo di Calabria's SPAD V.II Ruffo di Calabria returned to military duty before Italy's entry into World War I, and was assigned to the Battaglione Aviatori (which later became the Corpo Aeronautico Militare) on 20 December 1914. After pilot's training, on 28 September 1915, he was posted to the 4a Squadriglia Artiglia, an artillery coordination unit that later morphed into 44a Squadriglia. On 26 January 1916, he moved to 2a Squadriglia (later 42a Squadriglia). He won two Bronze awards of the Medal for Military Valor--in February and April 1916--while still a two-seater pilot with them. His personal emblem was a black skull and crossbones painted on the fuselage of his plane, whether it was his original Nieuport 11s, or his later Nieuport 17 and SPAD VII airplanes. Ruffo di Calabria underwent further training on Nieuports at Cascina Costa in May 1916.

By 16 September, when he shared a victory with Baracca and Luigi Olivari, he was scoring for his new unit, 70a Squadriglia. He ran his score with them to four confirmed and four unconfirmed by 28 February 1917. In March 1917, he was transferred out of the reserves when he was promoted to Tenente. In May he then switched to flying a Nieuport for 91a Squadriglia. He was awarded both a Silver and a Bronze Medal for Military Valor that same month. His promotion to Capitano came through in August 1917. By that time, his confirmed victories totaled 13. He ended 1917 with his total victories at 16. Ruffo di Calabria's records for 1918 are incomplete, but credit him with four more victories. On 5 May 1918, he was granted the ultimate Medal of Military Valor, the Gold award. After Baracca's death on 19 June 1918, Fulco assumed command of the renowned \\"Squadron of Aces\\". He relinquished command of 91a Squadriglia on 18 September to Ferruccio Ranza, after suffering a nervous breakdown.Guttman, Jon. SPAD XII/XIII Aces of World War I.

Post-World War I On 1 February 1919, the Bongiovanni commission's military intelligence report verified all 20 of Ruffo di Calabria's confirmed victories, though still denying the five that were unconfirmed.The Aerodrome Forum lists him with 20 confirmed and 6 not confirmed \\"victory credits\\" Di Calabria remained in the military, though without assignment. By 1925, his main activity was management of his family estates located near Paliano. In 1934, he was named senator of the kingdom by King Victor Emmanuel III. He also continued in the military, eventually rising to the rank of Tenente Colonello in 1942. Ruffo di Calabria served in the Italian senate until 1944. During World War II, he was a supporter of the Italian fascist leader Mussolini. He was subsequently convicted postwar by an Italian court for complicity in the crimes of fascism, and that ruling was upheld on 10 January 1946 despite his appeal.

They were east-bound slow convoys originating in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada (designated as Sydney, Cape Breton by the Allied navies to avoid confusion with Sydney, New South Wales); from there they sailed to ports in the UK, mainly Liverpool. The Royal Canadian Navy base responsible for the Sydney operations was . The first convoy, SC 1, departed Sydney Harbour on 15 August 1940. For a time after the entry of the United States into the war the point of origin was switched to New York, but congestion problems there resulted in a further move, this time to Halifax, Nova Scotia. However, the SC designation was retained throughout. SC convoys ran from August 1940 until May 1945, although they were suspended during the summer of 1944 when a number of escort groups were diverted to cover the Normandy landings. During this period all east-bound traffic sailed in the HX series, which ran as Fast or Slow convoys, and whose sizes were effectively doubled. A total of 177 SC convoys ran during the campaign, totalling 6,806 ships. Only 3 failed to complete the passage: SC 52 suffered an attack shortly after leaving port, and was forced to return; and SC 62 and SC 63 were both scattered by appalling weather conditions which forced those ships to proceed independently. Of these formations, 29 (around 20%) were attacked; they saw the loss of 145 ships ( though this number does not include stragglers, perhaps the same number again) and a further 18 lost in marine accidents (perhaps 340 in total; around 5%). As these were slow convoys, composed of ships making 8 knots or less, they were correspondingly more vulnerable, and witnessed a disproportionate number of attacks. The SC convoys were the subject of some of the major battles of the campaign. Of the 40 convoys which lost 6 or more ships, 11 of them were SC series. Some notable SC convoy battles were: * SC 7. Attacked in October 1940, 20 ships were sunk in the worst day's shipping losses of the entire campaign. * SC 42. Two U-boats were sunk by reinforcements coming to the aid of the weak Canadian escort for this September 1941 convoy. 14 ships lost in 3 days. * SC 94 in August 1942 marked the beginning of the climactic North Atlantic convoy battles following the 2nd Happy Time off the American east coast. * SC 104 lost seven ships while Escort Group B6 sank two U-boats in October 1942. * SC 107 lost 15 ships in November 1942 including five torpedoed by U-boat Ace Kapitänleutnant Siegfried Freiherr von Forstner's . * SC 118. Attacked in February 1943. U-boat Ace Kapitänleutnant Siegfried Freiherr von Forstner was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross when his U-402 torpedoed seven ships including Henry R. Mallory transporting American troops to Iceland. * SC 121. Attacked in March 1943 after being scattered by a Force 10 gale. Only 76 of the 275 crewmen of the sunken ships were rescued. * SC 122. Attacked in March 1943, this action, which converged with that around HX 229, was the largest convoy battle of the Atlantic campaign. *SC 130. Attacked in May 1943, this convoy was successfully defended, seeing the destruction of 5 U-boats and the death of Admiral Karl Dönitz's son Peter Dönitz without losing any ships. This action culminated the period known as Black May, which saw the withdrawal from the North Atlantic by the German navy.

Club career=England Born in Birmingham, England, Child signed with English First Division club Aston Villa when he turned fourteen in 1966. He remained with the club for the next six seasons but never made a first-team appearance. In 1972 the nineteen-year-old Child was loaned to the Atlanta Chiefs of the North American Soccer League. United States When Child arrived in Atlanta during the 1972 NASL season, he promptly scored eight goals in twelve games and was named a first team All Star. The Chiefs then purchased Child's contract from Villa. In 1973, the team became known as the Atlanta Apollos. In 1974, the Apollo traded Child to the expansion San Jose Earthquakes where he led the league in scoring with fifteen goals and six assists. In 1975, the NASL ran an indoor tournament during the 1974-1975 off season. The Earthquakes won the title and Child led the scoring, gaining MVP honors, with seven goals in four games.

Identity He is commonly assumed by some Egyptologists to be the son of his predecessor Nebiryraw I, given the rarity of the name Nebiriau in Egyptian historical sources.Kim Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C, Museum Tusculanum Press, (1997), p.155 Unlike his presumed father who ruled Upper Egypt for 26 years, he was an obscure king who is completely unattested by contemporary archaeological sources.Ryholt, p.201 The only two non-contemporary attestations for Nebiriau II are the mention of his personal name on the Ramesside Turin Canon (position 13.5, his throne name was lost), and a bronze statuette of the god Harpocrates (Cairo 38189). The four sides of the base of the statue were inscribed with the names written into cartouches; these are \\"Binpu\\", \\"Ahmose\\", \\"The good god Sewadjenre, deceased\\" and \\"The good god Neferkare, deceased\\" respectively.Donald B. Redford (1986). Pharaonic king- lists, annals and day-books: a contribution to the study of the Egyptian sense of history. Mississauga: Benben Publications, , p. 55 The first two were likely two princes of the royal family of the 17th Dynasty which would replace the 16th Dynasty shortly thereafter; Sewadjenre was the throne name of Nebiriau I and finally, it is believed that Neferkare is the otherwise unattested throne name of Nebiriau II. The finding is also peculiar because the cult of Harpocrates – and thus the statuette itself – dates back to the Ptolemaic period i.e. about 1500 years after the people named on the statuette had lived. Nebiriau II was succeeded by an equally obscure king named Semenre who is attested by a single axe – inscribed with his throne name – and then by Seuserenre Bebiankh who is given 12 years in the Turin Canon.

It also ran rail freight operations. The company went into administration at the end of March 2010. History=19th and 20th centuries The company was founded in 1846 as the Jarvis Construction Company. In 1994, Paris Moayedi was appointed Chief ExecutiveThe swift ascension of Jarvis and refocused the business on infrastructure maintenance and renewal. The Company acquired the Northern Infrastructure Maintenance Company, a rail maintenance business, in 1996.Jarvis in talks to buy third rail business It bought Fastline, a rail freight business, and Relayfast, a rail engineering business, in 1997. In 1998, it entered the road and airport maintenance business by acquiring Streamline Holdings.Jarvis buys Streamline 21st century Tamper in Jarvis PLC Fastline livery. In 2002, seven people were killed when a train derailed at Potters Bar after passing faulty and badly maintained points. As Infrastructure Maintenance Contractor for the line, Jarvis was considered jointly responsible for the crash (along with Railtrack), with the Office of Rail Regulation declaring \\"Jarvis’s performance fell far short of that to be expected of a competent IMC\\". On 16 September 2003 a GNER express was derailed at just after 07:00hrs (BST) immediately after leaving Platform 4 at King's Cross station in London. The immediate cause of the accident was the routing of the train onto a length of track with a missing rail. The length of rail had been removed during maintenance work, as is permissible, but it should not have been possible for a train to be routed onto the section of track where the rail had been removed. The significance of this accident was not in the accident itself, which was not serious, but in the political consequences for the private contractors, Jarvis plc, employed to maintain the track. The derailment did further damage to the company's reputation. The month after the derailment, Jarvis quit rail maintenance; this marked the end of private company-led rail maintenance in the UK, with all future work being administered by the state-owned company Network Rail. Moayedi resigned as chairman of the company in 2003 and was replaced by Steven Norris. The Company gradually over-extended itself and in 2004 was forced to sell its Private Finance Initiative (PFI) business to Vinci,Jarvis sells PFI unit to reduce debt mountain its European roads business to French group SomaroJarvis sells European roads business and its stake in Tube Lines to Ferrovial.Jarvis sells Tube stake to Spain The company also entered the vehicle hire business with a fleet of 1,700 vans by 2010.Fastline Transport - Vehicle Hire www.fastline-group.com In March 2010, the company announced that it was to enter administration, saying that, \\"Following negotiations with the company's secured lenders, it has today become clear that sufficient support will not be extended to the company to enable it to continue trading as a going concern.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Business services companies established in 1846 Category:Companies based in York Category:Business services companies of the United Kingdom Category:Construction and civil engineering companies of the United Kingdom Category:Engineering companies of the United Kingdom Category:1846 establishments in England Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 1846 Category:Construction and civil engineering companies disestablished in the 21st century Category:British companies disestablished in 2010 Category:British companies established in 1846 Category:2010 disestablishments in England ","title":"Jarvis plc"},{"id":"12762447","text":"Norman Sylla (born 27 September 1982) is a Guinean football striker.

Local legend held that Sauk leader Black Hawk used it to elude his pursuers, though there are differing details and versions of the story. One version puts Black Hawk's presence in the tree during the 1790s, while another states it was after the conclusion of the 1832 Black Hawk War and involved a young Lieutenant Jefferson Davis. In reality, it is unlikely that Black Hawk ever used the tree to hide, though he was probably in Prairie du Chien once after his surrender at the end of the 1832 Black Hawk War. The tree was felled by a windstorm during the 1920s. Background Local lore in Prairie du Chien held that the Sauk leader Black Hawk had once hidden in a cottonwood tree that was located in the city. In one version of the tale, the tree was said to have been used by Black Hawk during the 1790s to evade capture from troops stationed at Fort Crawford. Black Hawk would later become famous for his role in leading a band of Sauk and Fox, known as the British Band, back into Illinois in violation of several disputed treaties. The event triggered the Black Hawk War of 1832. Another version of the story held that one day, after his capture following the Black Hawk War, he was being escorted by Lieutenant Jefferson Davis and managed to escape. While eluding his pursuers, it is said, Black Hawk hid himself among the branches of the tree.\\"Black Hawk's Tree is still alive at Prairie du Chien,\\" LaCrosse Tribune, 2 July 1922, via Wisconsin State Historical Society. Retrieved 14 August 2007. This version of the story appeared in the LaCrosse Tribune in 1922; even then, the story noted, there were those who pronounced the tale a \\"myth.\\" Tree In reality, the local legend is probably untrue. Most historians believe that while Black Hawk was in Prairie du Chien once, it was not until after the decisive battle of the Black Hawk War at the mouth of the Bad Axe River. By this time, in August 1832, Black Hawk had surrendered to the custody of the Ho-Chunk and could not have hidden in the tree. Regardless of the veracity of the tale, the tree was unique in a settled area that had few trees and a large population utilizing wood for various purposes. A 1906 article in the Prairie du Chien Union debunked the popular tale, outlining the ownership of the property, the writer's interviews with the subjects, and their assertion that the tree was not planted until at least the 1840s.Fairfield, George. \\"History of the Black Hawk Tree,\\" Prairie du Chien Union, 8 March 1906, via Wisconsin State Historical Society. Retrieved 14 August 2007. The same article went on to assert the tree had a right to \\"importance and honorable mention\\" because of its namesake and the injustices he faced during the 1832 \\"war of extermination.\\" Newspaper accounts stated that visitors purposely passed the tree in automobiles and many stopped to view the tree. By 1922, the once two- trunked tree was reduced to one trunk and was in decline. During a windstorm in the 1920s, the Black Hawk Tree was destroyed, but even after its death the site continued to be marked. The Black Hawk Tree is, without question, the most well-known tree in the Prairie du Chien area and part of local lore.Allison, R.

These buildings, some of which have a history of over 1000 years, were the setting of historical events, domains of famous personalities and are still imposing buildings to this day. This list encompasses castles described in German as Burg (castle), Festung (fort/fortress), Schloss and Palais/Palast (palace). Many German castles after the middle ages were mainly built as royal or ducal palaces rather than as a fortified building.

The community of Llanstadwell includes the settlements of Hazelbeach, Mascle Bridge (or Mastlebridge), Jordanston, Waterston, Scoveston and Little Honeyborough. The population as of the 2011 UK Census was 905. Name The name derives from the dedication of the parish and church to St Tudwal, a 6th- century Breton monk. History Llanstadwell was in the cantref of Rhos, in the 16th century becoming the Hundred of Roose, but there are some ancient British sites within the present-day parish. The parish appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. The administrative parish of Llanstadwell originally included Neyland which, at the start of the 20th century had grown enough to have its own council. The ecclesiastical parish of Llanstadwell still includes Neyland, whose St Clement's Church is a daughter church to Llanstadwell. Worship The parish of Llanstadwell extends from the shore of the Cleddau as far north as Rosemarket and is largely rural with a few scattered hamlets. The parish church is dedicated to St Tudwal, and the area includes other places of worship at Little Honeyborough, Neyland (four chapels and a Roman Catholic church) and Waterston. St Tudwal's is believed to date from the 12th century, and the bells from 1684, but much of the present church is mid-19th century.

The official name is Kyo-hwa-so (Reeducation camp) No. 1. It is not to be confused with Kaechon internment camp (Kwan-li-so Nr. 14), which is located to the south-east. Location The camp is located in Kae'chŏn county, P'yŏngan-namdo province in North Korea. It is situated on the outskirts of Kaechon city, around east of the city center, behind a little hill.Google Maps: Kaechon city and the concentration camp, Updated: August 12, 2009 Description Kaechon concentration camp is a large prison compound, around 300 m (1000 feet) long and 300 m (1000 feet) wide, surrounded by a 4 m (13 feet) high wall with barbed wire on top.Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: Satellite Imagery of the North Korean Gulag: Kyo- hwa-so No. 1 Kaechon Overview, p. 225 The prisoners, around 4000 men and 2000 women (in 1992), are political prisoners mixed with common criminals. Theoretically prisoners should be released after reeducation through labor and serving their sentence. But as the prison sentences are very long and the conditions are extremely harsh, many do not survive their prison sentences. Ji Hae-nam estimates that during her sentence of two years around 20% of the prisoners died.Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: The Hidden Gulag (Section: Testimony Kyo-hwa-so No. 1 Kaechon, p. 100 - 105) Purpose The main purpose of Kaechon camp is to punish people for less-serious crimes, whereas political crimes (e. g. criticism of the government) are considered a severe offense. But the prisoners are also used as slave workers, who have to fulfill high production quotas in very difficult conditions. For this purpose there is a shoe making factory, a leather and rubber factory, a clothing factory and other factories in the camp. Human rights situation The human rights situation in the camp is described in detail by Lee Soon-ok in her testimony to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. She explains how the prisoners have no rights and how they are treated at the mercy of the guards. Forced labour The prisoners are forced to work around 18 hours per day at the camp's factories. If someone does not work quickly enough, he or she is beaten. Sometimes prisoners sleep at their workplaces to fulfill the production quota. All this involves frequent work accidents and many prisoners are crippled from the work or from torture.Citizens’ Alliance for North Korean Human Rights: Life in Kaechon Indoctrination Camp Health and sanitation Prisoners are forced to sleep in a room with 80 to 90 people in 30 square metre (322 square feet) flea-infested rooms. Prisoners are only occasionally allowed to use the toilet (one for about 300 people) and may only take a shower after several months. Diseases like paratyphus are common, resulting from the bad nutrition. Malnutrition Food rations are 100 grams of broken corn three times a day and a salt soup. In case of rule violations food rations are reduced. Lee Soon-ok reported that prisoners even killed rats and ate them raw in order to survive. A survivor: Soon Ok Lee – 7 years of torture in N. Korean prison camp, October 28, 2003, NBC News Torture There are 78 punishment cells in the camp, each 60 cm (24 inches) wide and 110 cm (43 inches) high, where prisoners are locked up several days. Afterwards many of them are unable to walk and some even die. Prisoners are often beaten, kicked or whipped. Lee Soon-ok was tortured being forced to drink a large quantity of water until she fainted (water torture) and almost died. During her sentence she witnessed many types of torture. Homicides and Infanticides Pregnant women are forced to have abortions by injections. Lee Soon-ok witnessed babies born alive being murdered directly after birth. Executions As with all the prison camps, public executions are commonplace and usually done in front of all of the prisoners.United States Senate Hearings: Testimony of Ms. Soon Ok Lee, June 21, 2002 Prisoners (witnesses) * Lee Soon-ok (1987–1992 in Kaechon) was imprisoned on alleged embezzlement of state property, when she refused to put material on the side for her superior. She was sentenced to 13 years in a prison camp, but released earlier under a surprise amnesty. * Ji Hae-nam (1993–1995 in Kaechon) was imprisoned on disruption of the socialist order, as she sang a South Korean pop song and was denounced by a neighbor. She was sentenced to 3 years in a prison camp, but released after 2 years and 2 months.Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: The Hidden Gulag (Section: Testimony Kyo-hwa-so No. 1 Kaechon, p. 100 - 105) See also * Human rights in North Korea * Prisons in North Korea * Yodok concentration camp * Kaechon internment camp * Lee Soon Ok * Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman External links * United States Senate Hearings: Testimony of Ms. Soon Ok Lee – Lee Soon-oks testimony to the US Senate Judiciary Committee June 21, 2002 * Committee for Human Rights in North Korea – Overview on North Korean Prison Camps with Testimonies and Satellite Photographs * Daily NK: North Korean crimes against humanity – Collection of testimonies * Witness reveals horror of North Korean gulag - Report on prison camps, The Guardian, July 19, 2002 * A survivor: Soon Ok Lee – 7 years of torture in N.

The tea rooms are famous for being the only cafe in Queensland to include kopi luwak coffee on their menu, hailed as the most expensive coffee in the world.Australia's Most Expensive Cup Of Coffee?, 12 April 2007.  Kopi luwak  Kopi luwak is an Indonesian coffee made from beans that have passed through the digestive system of the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), known in Indonesia as the luwak. Collected from the floor of the jungle, the defecated beans are dried and roasted, and then exported for a price of up to A$1,250 per kilogram.  North Queensland's oldest building  The Heritage Tea Rooms are situated inside North Queensland's oldest building - a split log construction built circa 1865. Formerly known as the Eureka Hotel, the building has been restored to its former glory and remains standing as one of the countries few slab sided inn's. In the 1860s the inn provided a welcome respite for early travelers ascending the range via Thorntons Gap.  Other attractions  Aside from kopi luwak, the Heritage Tea Rooms provide a variety of attractions including: * Birdwatching - with over 150 varieties of birds in the local vicinity. * Close proximity to the Herveys Range scenic drive, with direct road access to Charters Towers and the Atherton Tablelands In the media  On 1 July 2007, the Australian Channel Seven show Border Security: Australia's Front Line ran a story on kopi luwak being imported into Australia. Customs officials decided after much deliberation that the rare coffee would pose no threat to the Australian agricultural industry, and approved the importation. For many viewers, this was the first they had ever heard of kopi luwak.Who Loves Border Security?, 10 July 2007.

In a sheep-farming area spread over half-a-million hectares, greater Colesberg breeds many of the country's top merinos. It is also renowned for producing high-quality racehorses and many stud farms, including one owned by renowned golfer, Gary Player, are nearby.  History  Founded in 1830 on an abandoned station of the London Missionary Society, and initially named Toverberg after a nearby hill, it was renamed Colesberg after Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole, then Governor of the Cape Colony. The site of the town lay on one of the well- travelled routes used by traders, hunters and explorers to gain access to the interior. Towerberg or Coleskop is a prominent hill near the town and a landmark easily seen from a distance by travellers. Colesberg saw a large number of battles and skirmishes during the second Anglo-Boer War, and the Colesberg Garden of Remembrance is located just outside the town. Another view of part of the main street A number of 1820 Settlers established farms in the Colesberg district. Outnumbered as a religious group, some attended the Methodist Church and others the Dutch Reformed Church, where services in English were specially held for them. Anglican officials in Cape Town appointed Dr CEH Orpen as rector and the first services were conducted in the Court House and the London Mission Chapel, which became known as St Stephen's Church. In 1852 the construction of the Anglican Christ Church was started, having been designed by Sophy Gray, wife of the Cape Town bishop Robert Gray. The Colesberg Bank was founded in 1861. Michael Davitt wrote while documenting the Second Boer War, that the previous generation noted the village as a rendezvous for hunters and diamond miners. Past residents *General Piet Cronje a South African general in the both Anglo-Boer wars. * Frans du Toit a South African Economist, and Trade Commissioner. *Hennie Bingle rector of the PUK Cityscape=Architecture The town boasts many buildings that were built in a blend of Cape Dutch and Georgian architecture with ceilings of reed, and yellowwood timbers, and others that display a range of designs reflecting the changes of 19th century building. Originally plots were pegged out and sold on the site of the town to fund the building of the Dutch Reformed church. Society and culture=Museums, monuments and memorials A large number of Heritage Sites registered with the South African Heritage Resources Agency are located in Colesberg.  Economy  Farming in the area is dedicated almost entirely to horses and merino sheep. While in a sheep-farming area spread over half-a-million hectares, greater Colesberg breeds many of the country's top merinos. Colesberg is renowned for producing high-quality racehorses and many stud farms, including one owned by legendary golfer, Gary Player, are nearby. The ostrich-feather boom of the early 1900s, which left many farmers rich, is long forgotten. The town has a thriving tourism industry, in part because it represents a rough halfway point between Johannesburg and Cape Town. There is a hotel, a motel, and many guest houses and B&Bs; around town, most having restaurants and pubs on-site. Several guest farms operate in the district offering accommodation with 4x4 trails, mountain bike trails, game hunting (mainly springbok, wildebeest and blesbok) and bird watching. Three major service stations with on-site shops, restaurants and toilet facilities are located on the N1 at Colesberg. Small industries are located in town, including a sheep abattoir, a factory which makes a range of furniture to order and a panel beater. The Doornkloof Nature Reserve is located near Colesberg on the confluence of the Orange and Seekoei Rivers.

It is the fourth book in the Factory series, following He Died with His Eyes Open, The Devil's Home on Leave, and How the Dead Live. Plot summary In the fourth novel in the Factory series opens, young prostitute Dora Suarez is axed into pieces. The killer then smashes the head of her neighbour, an 86-year-old widow. On the same night, a mile away in the West End, a shotgun blows the top off the head of Felix Roatta, part owner of the seedy Parallel Club. As the detective obsesses over the young woman whose murder he investigates, he discovers that her death is even more bizarre than he had suspected: the murderer ate bits of flesh from Suarez’s corpse and ejaculated on her thigh. Autopsy results compound the puzzle: Suarez was dying of AIDS, but the pathologist is unable to determine how she had contracted HIV. Then a photo, supplied by a former Parallel hostess, links Suarez to Roatta, and the detective's inquiries at the nightclub reveal her vile and inhuman exploitation. Criticism Cook’s notoriety crested following the 1990 publication of what many consider his best – and most repulsive – work: the tortured, redemptive tale of a masochistic serial killer, I Was Dora Suarez. To Cook’s delight, the ensuing novel caused Dan Franklin, the publisher of its three predecessors, to vomit over his desk. As a result of this reader response, Secker & Warburg told the author to take his nauseating wares elsewhere. Scribner took over the fourth novel in the factory series. Writing for The New York Times, Marilyn Stasio proclaimed, “Everything about I Was Dora Suarez...shrieks of the joy and pain of going too far.” Filmmaker Chris Petit described it in The Times as “a book full of coagulating disgust and compassion for the world’s contamination, disease and mutilation, all dwelt on with a feverish, metaphysical intensity that recalls Donne and the Jacobeans more than any of Raymond’s contemporaries.” Cook recognized I Was Dora Suarez as his greatest but most onerous achievement: “Writing Suarez broke me; I see that now. I don’t mean that it broke me physically or mentally, although it came near to doing both. But it changed me; it separated out for ever what was living and what was dead. I realised it was doing so at the time, but not fully, and not how, and not at once. […] I asked for it, though. If you go down into the darkness, you must expect it to leave traces on you coming up — if you do come up. It’s like working in a mine; you hope that hands you can’t see know what they’re doing and will pull you through. I know I wondered half way through Suarez if I would get through — I mean, if my reason would get through. For the trouble with an experience like Suarez is that you become what you’re writing, passing like Alice through the language into the situation.” (The Hidden Files, pp. 132-133.) Adaptations Robin Cook read some excerpts of his novels in a live performance with background music by the alternative rock band Gallon Drunk.

Hottinger collaborated with the Natural History Museum of Basel (Switzerland). Hottinger was one of the major experts on present-day and fossil larger foraminifera. In 1997 he obtained the Cushman Award from the Cushman Foundation for Foraminiferal Research (Journal of Foraminiferal Research, vol. 28/1, 1–2) for his lifetime contributions to foraminiferal research. Professor Hottinger completed his PhD thesis on Paleocene and Eocene Alveolina in 1959 under the direction of Professor Manfred Reichel. His thesis on Paleogene Alveolina included genus and species definitions and changes through time, the concept of phylogenetic lineages, and their use in zonal biochronology. Published as a double volume of Mémoires Suisse de Paléontologie in 1960, this remains the authoritative work on these unique foraminifera. From 1959 to 1964 he lived in Morocco working for the geological survey under the direction of Georges Choubert and Anne Faure- Muret, a time that was essential for his formation. His bibliography, widely respected by the international scientific community, comprises over 120 papers and six monographs. These contributions range far over the geological landscape, including topics as diverse as stratigraphy, paleoecology, and evolution, and spanning the globe from Indo-Pacific and Africa to the northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Besides being a member of the Swiss Academy of Natural Sciences, in 1993 Professor Hottinger was honored with membership in the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and in 1997 was awarded the Doctor Honoris Causa by the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona (Spain).

His father Ichikawa Danjūrō XII died in 2013; in January 2019, Ebizō announced that he would adopt the name of Danjūrō, thus becoming Ichikawa Danjūrō XIII, in May 2020.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2019/01/14/entertainment- news/popular-kabuki-actor-ichikawa-ebizo-become-13th-holder-danjuro-stage- name/#.XSS4-etKjIU The name change was postponed when Kabuki shows were cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Career=Early acting career At a very young age, Ebizō began rigorous training: voice training to master the unusual vocalizations that characterize Kabuki, and physical training to prepare for the stylized movements and poses demanded on the stage. Ichikawa Ebizō XI appeared on stage for the first time at age five in 1983 at the Kabukiza Theater in the role of “Harumiya” in the performance of The Tale of Genji (Genji Monogatari). In 1985, he received the stage name Ichikawa Shinnosuke VII, an honorific name in the Ichikawa lineage, and made his full stage debut in the performance of Uiro-uri also at the Kabukiza Theater. In 1994, he made his first television appearance in the NHK Taiga drama, Hana no Ran, which starred his father Ichikawa Danjuro XII. And in 2003, he was cast as a leading role Miyamoto Musashi, in the NHK Taiga drama, Musashi. Later work In 2011, Ichikawa Ebizō XI landed a starring role in the film Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai, which premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The film Ask This of Rikyu in 2013 was a biographical film of Sen no Rikyū in which he won Best Actor at the 37th Japan Academy Film Prize for performing the title role. The following year, he starred in the film Over Your Dead Body, and in 2017 he appeared in a supporting role in the Japanese samurai film Blade of the Immortal, which also premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. He has appeared numerous times at the Kabuki-za Theater, Osaka Shochikuza Theater, Minami-za Theater, and many other theaters in Japan. In recent years, Ebizō has been actively engaged in producing performances to reintroduce the values of traditional Japanese art to the contemporary generation in projects. Since 2012, Ebizō has produced the performance series entitled “Invitation to the Classics” to make Kabuki more accessible to smaller cities in rural Japan. Also, in 2013, 2015 and 2017, he self-produced an innovative project called “ABKAI” where the original contemporary Kabuki was introduced. On November 28, 2019, Ebizō starred as Kairennosuke in the stage production . In addition, his son Kangen Horikoshi portrayed a younger version of Kairennosuke in the play's third act. International performance His activities have taken him abroad extensively, including performances in Paris in 2004, London/Amsterdam in May–June 2006, Paris Opera in March 2007, Monaco Opera in September 2009, London/Rome in June 2010, Singapore in November 2014 and October 2015, UAE in February 2016. He has also appeared at Carnegie Hall in New York City in February 2016, which collaborated with Noh and Kyogen. Ebizō became the first kabuki actor to hold commemorative performances at the Theatre national de Chaillot in Paris, and he earned a nomination for the prestigious Laurence Olivier Award for his work on the London stage in 2006. In 2007, France awarded him its prestigious The Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in appreciation of his work.

Personal life On November 19, 2009, he announced his engagement to news presenter Mao Kobayashi. On November 25, 2010, Ebizō got involved in a late-night brawl at a members-only bar in the Nishi Azabu district of Tokyo, and sustained serious injuries, including a burst blood vessel in his left eye. Although the assailant, a member of a motorcycle gang, was arrested and jailed, the court's judgment was that Ebizō's role in provoking the incident could not be denied. The incident caused a subsequent hiatus in his acting activities, and led to the cessation of a commercial advertising campaign featuring him. The incident received broad coverage due to Ebizō's status, and brought to public view the links that exist between the entertainment world and mobsters in Japan. On July 25, 2011, his daughter, Reika, was born. On March 22, 2013, his son and successor, Kangen Horikoshi, was born. When Ebizō succeeds to the name of Ichikawa Danjūrō XIII in May 2020, his son will become Ichikawa Shinnosuke VIII.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2019/01/14/entertainment- news/popular-kabuki-actor-ichikawa-ebizo-become-13th-holder-danjuro-stage- name/#.XSS4-etKjIU In 2016, he ordained as a Shingon Buddhist monk at Narita- san Shinshō-ji temple.

He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. DEPTEL 243, also known as Telegram 243, the August 24 cable or most commonly Cable 243, was a high-profile message sent on August 24, 1963, by the United States Department of State to Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the US ambassador to South Vietnam. The cable came in the wake of the midnight raids on August 21 by the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem against Buddhist pagodas across the country, in which hundreds were believed to have been killed. The raids were orchestrated by Diem's brother Ngô Đình Nhu and precipitated a change in US policy. The cable declared that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu remaining in a position of power and ordered Lodge to pressure Diem to remove his brother. It said that if Diem refused, the Americans would explore the possibility for alternative leadership in South Vietnam. In effect, the cable authorized Lodge to give the green light to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) officers to launch a coup against Diem if he did not willingly remove Nhu from power. The cable marked a turning point in US-Diem relations and was described in the Pentagon Papers as \\"controversial\\". Historian John M. Newman described it as \\"the single most controversial cable of the Vietnam War\\".Jacobs, p. 161. The cable also highlighted an internal split in the Kennedy administration, with anti-Diem officials in the State Department prevailing over generals and Department of Defense officials who remained optimistic that the Vietnam War was proceeding well under Diem. This was underlined by the manner in which the cable was prepared before being transmitted to Lodge.  Background  Ngo Dinh Nhu (r), shaking hands with US Vice President alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. The cable came in the wake of the midnight raids of August 21 by the Catholic regime of Ngo Dinh Diem against Buddhist pagodas across the country in which hundreds were believed to have been killed and more than a thousand monks and nuns were arrested. The pagodas were also extensively vandalized. Initially, the raids coincided with the declaration of martial law on the day before. A group of generals of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam had asked Diem to give them extra powers to fight the Viet Cong but secretly wanted to maneuver for a coup. Diem agreed, so that Nhu's Special Forces could take advantage and attack the Buddhist pagoda while disguised as regular ARVN forces. The raids were instigated by Nhu's Special Forces and Secret Police.Jacobs, pp. 152-154. At first, there was confusion as to what had occurred. Nhu had ordered the phone lines into the US embassy and the US Information Service to be cut. A curfew was imposed on the streets, and it was initially believed that the regular army had orchestrated the attacks. The Voice of America initially broadcast Nhu's version of the events, which held that the army was responsible. This infuriated the ARVN generals, since many Vietnamese listened to the program as their only source of non-government, non-propaganda news. Through CIA officer Lucien Conein, General Trần Văn Đôn communicated to the Americans that Nhu had created the impression that the ARVN were responsible in order to increase dissent among the lower ranks and to weaken support for and discredit the generals in case they were planning a coup.Jacobs, p. 160.  Preparation of the cable  W. Averell Harriman was one of the foremost proponents of Diem's removal and key figure behind the cable. The message was drafted by W. Averell Harriman, Roger Hilsman and Michael ForrestalJones, p. 314. who were the only senior State Department officials on duty on August 24, 1963, a Saturday afternoon, with Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and CIA director John McCone on vacation. President John F. Kennedy was on vacation at Hyannis Port, his family retreat, when Forrestal telephoned seeking to expedite the process with the commander-in- chief's verbal approval.Jones, p. 315. Kennedy asked them to \\"wait until Monday\\" when all the key figures would be in Washington, but Forrestal said that Harriman and Hilsman wanted to get the cable \\"out right away\\". Kennedy thus told Forrestal to get another high-ranking official to \\"get it cleared\\". Harriman and Hilsman then drove from their offices to a Maryland golf course where Under Secretary of State George Ball was playing with Alexis Johnson. Ball told the trio to meet him at his home after he and Johnson finished their round of golf. Having returned home, Ball read the message but-- knowing that the telegram could raise the morale of the generals and prompt a coup--refused to authorize it until his three visitors had gained Secretary of State Dean Rusk's endorsement. Those present at Ball's home then phoned and read the important passages of the message to Rusk. They asked Rusk what he thought of the message if Kennedy was comfortable too. Rusk replied, \\"Well, go ahead. If the president understood the implications, [I] would give a green light.\\" Ball then discussed the matter with the president, who asked \\"What do you think?\\" over the phone. Ball said that Harriman and Hilsman were in strong support, saying that his \\"watered down\\" version \\"would certainly be taken as encouragement by the generals to a coup.\\" Ball said that his group regarded Diem as an embarrassment to Washington because of his \\"most unconscionable and cruel, uncivilized\\" actions. He further cited Nhu's violence against the Buddhists and Madame Nhu's verbal attacks as reasons for breaking with Diem.Jones, p. 316. According to Ball, Kennedy appeared to be broadly supportive of the cable, although apprehensive as to whether a new leader would do a better job. As McNamara was away, Kennedy told Ball that the message was acceptable if Rusk and Roswell Gilpatric endorsed it. Rusk then approved the message. In the 1980s, Rusk said \\"If Ball, Harriman, and President Kennedy were going to send it out, I wasn't going to raise any questions.\\" Forrestal then phoned Gilpatric's farm in the evening and told him that both Kennedy and Rusk had already approved. Gilpatric later recalled that \\"If Rusk went along with it and the President went along with it, I wasn't going to oppose it.\\" He washed his hands of the matter, saying that it was between Kennedy and the state department, saying that \\"In McNamara's absence I felt I should not hold it up, so I went along with it just like you countersign a voucher.\\" Marine General Victor Krulak also signed off without showing his superior, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Maxwell Taylor. Richard Helms of the CIA also endorsed the message without notifying the director John McCone; he later said that he believed that Forrestal was only advising of a resolution that had already been made. Forrestal then told Kennedy that he had gained the support of Kennedy's inner circle, so the president told him to send the message. Cable 243 was thus sent to Lodge at 21:36.  Cable  The opening paragraphs of the cable stated: The cable went on to instruct Lodge to inform Diem that the US could not accept the raids and to call for strong action to address the Buddhist crisis. Lodge was told to tell the South Vietnamese military officers that: The cable also informed Lodge of the need to exonerate the ARVN from responsibility of the pagoda raids. It asked Lodge to approve a broadcast by the Voice of America placing the responsibility on Nhu. Lodge was further requested to examine and search for alternative leadership to replace Diem.  Lodge's response  Lodge replied the next day and endorsed the strong position but proposed to refrain from approaching Diem to suggest that Nhu be removed. Lodge advocated only stating the US position to the generals and in effect to encourage the ARVN to stage a coup. Lodge's cable stated:  Infighting  U.S. President John F. Kennedy regretted his authorization of the coup. The decision to authorise the cable prompted significant infighting in the Kennedy administration. This began on a Monday morning meeting at the White House on August 26. Kennedy was met with angry comments by Rusk, McNamara, McCone and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Maxwell Taylor, all of whom denied authorizing the cable. Kennedy was reported to have said \\"My God! My government's coming apart.\\" Taylor felt insulted by the final line of the cable which asserted that only the \\"minimum essential people\\" had seen its contents. During an acrimonious exchange at a midday meeting, he condemned the cable as an \\"egregious end run\\" by an anti-Diem faction. Hilsman rebutted Taylor by asserting that Kennedy and representatives of departments and agencies had approved the message. Years afterward, Taylor declared: Taylor claimed that the message was reflective of Forrestal and Hilsman's \\"well-known compulsion\\" to remove Diem.Jones, p. 318. He accused them of pulling \\"a fast one\\". Kennedy could no longer stand the arguing among his officials and shouted \\"This shit has got to stop!\\" Kennedy was angry at Forrestal and Hilsman; the former for what he deemed to be incompetence and Harriman for indiscretion. When Kennedy angrily criticised Forrestal for proceeding without gaining the explicit approval of McCone, Forrestal offered to resign. Kennedy acerbically replied \\"You're not worth firing. You owe me something, so you stick around.\\"Jones, p. 319. In the end, despite the bitter disagreement, the cable was not retracted. Ball refused to back down, maintaining that \\"the evil influence of the Nhus\\" overrode all other factors. Ball later described Diem as \\"an offense to America\\" and said that his government should not tolerate \\"such brutality and crass disregard of world sensitivities\\". However, he also admitted that he did not know much about the leading figures in South Vietnam. McCone did not advocate a reversal of policy despite disagreeing with the process in which the telegram left Washington. Taylor also agreed to stand by the original decision despite his disagreement. He said that \\"You can't change American policy in twenty-four hours and expect anyone to ever believe you again.\\" Kennedy walked around the meeting table and asked each of his advisers whether they wanted to change course. None were willing to tell him to retract his telegram. Colby recalled that \\"It is difficult indeed to tell a President to his face that something he has approved is wrong and to do so without anything positive to offer in its place.\\" As a result, Kennedy chose not to revoke Cable 243, thereby enabling Lodge to proceed in encouraging a coup. The historian Howard Jones called it \\"a momentous decision\\". According to Hilsman, Kennedy \\"didn't say anything\\" with regards to reservations about the coup. Kennedy had unanimous but uneasy and unhappy support from his advisers, although in reality only the decision had been made by a vocal anti-Diem minority who had sidestepped their colleagues and avoided getting a consensus to put in place a policy without thorough deliberation. The president was angry with himself and his advisers; him for being pressured into a hasty decision and his advisers for their dishonesty. alt=Middle-aged man with graying dark hair parted slightly off-center. He wears a green dress uniform, with suit and tie, is clean-shaven, and has four stars on his shoulder to indicate his rank. Robert Kennedy had discussed the matter of revoking the cable with McNamara and Taylor, but felt pressured into not backflipping on something that the administration had not \\"fully discussed, as every other major decision since the Bay of Pigs had been discussed\\". Taylor felt that the cable broke the solidarity of the Kennedy administration, and created a cold atmosphere. Kennedy later described the cable as a \\"major mistake\\", feeling that most of the blame fell at Harriman's feet. His brother said \\"The result is we started down a road that we never really recovered from\\".Jones, p. 320. Encouraged by the authorization for Lodge to interfere directly in South Vietnam's governance process, the critics of Diem from the State Department tried to capitalize on the momentum that they had developed. A midday meeting followed at the White House on the same Monday, August 26. Continuing on from Saturday's activism, Hilsman recommended pressuring Diem to replace his brother Nhu with a combination of military figures and civilians. Encouraged by the administration's choice to proceed with the telegram, Hilsman said that if Diem retained his brother, Washington should move to remove Diem and start a military-led regime led by General Trần Thiện Khiêm, the Army Chief of Staff and General Nguyễn Khánh, who commanded the II Corps--one of four in South Vietnam--based in the Central Highlands town of Pleiku. Kennedy asked Hilsman of the consequences of a failed coup; his adviser said that it would be bad for the US, as Nhu was anti-American. McNamara agreed with Hilsman, and they thought that only Tung's men and some marine battalions remained loyal to Nhu. The advisors thought that the officer corps would mostly be anti-Diem after the pagoda raids, and said that they would no longer fight if the Ngos stayed in power. They thus concluded that if the coup failed, the communists would win, so the Americans had to either leave Vietnam pre-emptively or be forced out if the coup failed, or to overthrow Diem. Hilsman said that contingency plans for an American evacuation had been made. Harriman then called for American moves for a coup, with which Kennedy agreed, The president also criticized the media coverage of The New York Times' Saigon correspondent David Halberstam, who had debunked Nhu's false claims that the army had launched the raids, and had been severely critical of the Ngo family. Kennedy called for \\"assurances we were not giving him serious consideration in our decision. When we move to eliminate this government, it should not be the result of [The] New York Times pressure.\\" Taylor remained opposed to any moves towards the disposal of Diem. Years afterward, he said that Diem was \\"a terrible pain in the neck\\", but was a devoted servant of his country. Taylor called on Kennedy to support Diem until a better leader had been lined up, pointing out that the officers were divided and therefore could not be relied on to plot and stage a coup. Hilsman then cited two phone calls on August 24 from Admiral Harry D. Felt, the commander of US forces in the Pacific, calling for backing to the generals to remove Nhu. Felt said that the mid-level officers would not fight if Nhu was not removed. Taylor became angry that Felt had advised the State Department to move against Diem without first consulting the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Taylor then told Kennedy that Americans would not tolerate their officers selecting the president, and thus they should not usurp the cabinet in doing the same in South Vietnam.Jones, p. 321. When pressed by McNamara as to which generals to support, Hilsman listed only Dương Văn Minh, Trần Thiện Khiêm, and Nguyễn Khánh, and said that the trio had some colleagues that they refused to name. Kennedy expressed agreement with Lodge that the Ngo brothers would never part ways, as did officials in Vietnam, but Rusk disagreed, still hesitant to endorse a coup, although he said a decisive action would be necessary either way. Hilsman continued to say that the Vietnamese public blamed the Nhus for the situation and would welcome a coup, which in his opinion, would need support. Rusk said that if Nhu stayed, \\"we must actually decide whether to move our resources out or to move our troops in\\". Hilsman ended the meeting by saying to \\"It is imperative that we act\\". According to Jones, the policy was \\"inherently contradictory: It offered Diem an opportunity to salvage his regime by making reforms at the same time that it undercut his regime by assuring assistance to the generals if they staged a coup.\\"  Notes  References   Category:Buddhist crisis Category:1963 in Vietnam Category:History of South Vietnam Category:History of the foreign relations of the United States Category:Ngo Dinh Diem ","title":"Cable 243"},{"id":"12762843","text":"Heinz Barth (15 October 1920 – 6 August 2007) was a mid-ranking member in the Waffen-SS of Nazi Germany during World War II.

The 1983 East German court found that Barth participated, as a member of security police battalion, in execution of 92 Czech civilians during martial law in summer of 1942 in Klatovy and Pardubice. He was also one of those who, in June 1942, shot 32 citizens of Ležáky according to the historian Eduard Stehlík from the Military History Institute in Prague.Czech notice of Barth's death Barth joined the SS on 10 February 1943 (n°458037) with the rank of Untersturmführer(Second Lieutenant) and was assigned to the SS-Kraft Pioneers detachment.

During his 1983 trial, he testified to having personally shot roughly fifteen times into the crowd. He also confirmed that the massacre of 642 civilians (the whole village, including more than 200 children) had no military objective. Trial and conviction After the end of the war, Barth returned to his hometown in Brandenburg in the then German Democratic Republic. According to the AFP, he returned under a false name.

It served mainly as the cemetery for the descendants of Chinese settlers in Gaochang from the 4th century to the first half of the 8th century. The complex covers and contains over 1,000 tombs. Due to the arid environment many important artifacts have been well preserved at the tombs, including natural mummies. Description of the tombs Stairs leading to an underground tomb. Portrait of a servant, mid-8th century, color on silk, Tang Dynasty, from the Astana Graves The tombs consist of sloping passageways leading downwards for 4 or 5m to a rockcut entrance, about a meter wide and over a meter high. A step then leads into a brick-lined chamber, square or oblong and measuring between two and four meters wide, three to four meters long and up to two meters high. Some tombs contain one or two narrow antechambers in which there are niches on either side for guardian beasts in effigy. These figures show a variety of animal features and some have human faces. In their exuberance they resemble the clay statues of Guardian Kings similarly found at the entrance to Buddhist temples. The body or bodies were shrouded in textiles. A silver oval shaped eye-mask and an oval piece of silk covered the face. Sometimes coins were used instead of these eye-masks. The origin of placing a coin inside the mouth is unclear: Stein saw parallels with the Greek custom of providing the deceased with the fare for the ferryman of Hades, but Chinese scholars have argued the same custom is seen in Chinese burials from the first millennium BC. The coins included Byzantine, locally minted replica Byzantine, other locally minted replica Chinese coins and Chinese coins. The bodies were originally placed inside wooden coffins, propped up with bundles of paper, and with small articles of personal use and models of garments made from paper and silk — such as shoes and hats — placed alongside them. Other offerings were placed inside wooden or pottery vessels near the head of the coffin on a wooden pedestal. Many of the vessels were painted with a distinctive pattern of white dots and red lines. Remains of food, desiccated but identifiable, were found in some of the unrobbed tombs and included grapes, plums, pears, pieces of meat and wheat. Several tombs contained well-preserved pastries, including a jam tart. According to Chinese beliefs, the afterlife was very similar to the life from which they had departed, and the deceased were therefore buried with goods and money they would require. However, it was sufficient to bury models and not original objects. These include human figurines, animals, clothes, ornaments and musical instruments. They were listed on a written inventory, also placed inside the tomb. Many tombs also contained epitaph tablets for the dead and a funerary banner showing the Chinese mythological figures, Fuxi and Nüwa. There are various Tang Dynasty figurines and Chinese silk paintings found in the cemetery. A new pavilion has been built outside the cemetery the centerpiece of which is a large statue of Fuxi and Nüwa. History of the area At the start of the first millennium this area was occupied by the Jushi who offered allegiance to the Chinese Han court. According to the Chinese histories, the Shiji and Hanshu, the original inhabitants east of the Tian Shan to the beginning of the first millennium AD, the Jushi, were a people who 'lived in felt-tents, kept moving in pursuit of water and grass for grazing, and had a fair knowledge of farming.' The Chinese rulers divided their territory in 60 BC and stationed a garrison and military colony there. Until 450 AD the main city was Jiaohe, west of present-day Turfan. At times the Chinese lost control to the Xiongnu and also withdrew when control in central China broke down. In the early 4th century an alternative commandery was established in Gaochang to the east of present-day Turfan, and this area also fell in and out of Chinese and steppe control over the following centuries. Excavations The site was visited by many of the archaeological expeditions sent by various imperial powers to Chinese Central Asia in the first two decades of the 20th century, among them the Japanese expeditions of Ōtani Kōzui in 1902, the German expeditions led by Albert Grünwedel (Nov 1902-March 1903) and Albert von Le Coq (1904-7, 1913-4), and the Russian Sergey Oldenburg between 1909–10. The archaeologist Aurel Stein also went to Astana in 1907, then returned for longer in December 1914. Chinese archaeologists have undertaken over ten excavations at the Astana and Gaochang graveyards from 1959 onwards, unearthing 456 tombs, 205 of which contained manuscript fragments. Most of these fragments were originally part of funerary objects – paper shoes, paper hats, paper belts, paper coffins - made from discarded documents. Two thousand documents were found which yield insights into the life of the people there. Objects from the tombs A mummy from a tomb at the Astana Graves Material from the Russian explorations was originally deposited in the Asiatic Museum of St. Petersburg. Later the manuscripts were transferred to the St Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The Japanese collections were taken to Kyoto but were soon dispersed after Otani resigned as Abbot of Nishi Honganji in 1914. Unlike the other expeditions, the Japanese monk- explorers were privately funded by Otani and so the finds were not deposited in public collections. Although by 1926 the first expedition material was in the Imperial Gift Museum of Kyoto, by 1944 these items were in the hands of the private collector Teizo Kimura. The Japanese Government had to repurchase them after the war and, along with some other items bought from other individuals, the collection was deposited in the Oriental Section of Tokyo National Museum, where it remains today. A large part of Otani’s second and third expedition material were kept in his house and sold along with the house in 1916. The buyer, Fusanoske Kuhara, was a friend of Terauchi Masatake, Governor-General of Korea (annexed by Japan in 1910). He presented the collection to his friend who kept it in the Museum of the Governor-General, which later became the National Central Museum in Seoul (now the National Museum of Korea). The German collections are in the Staatsbibliothek (manuscripts) and the Museum for Asian Art, Berlin. Stein's collections from Astana are in the British Library, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Museum, New Delhi. Many thousands of artifacts found by Chinese archaeologists since 1958 were removed to the Ürümqi Museum. Objects from the tombs from various excavations have been displayed in several exhibitions.

Life Perkins was born in Old Newburyport, Massachusetts, the second son of six children of Jacob Perkins and his wife, Hannah, née Greenleaf. His name came from that of his father's brother in-law and close friend Angier March. Jacob Perkins travelled to the UK in 1819 in order to exploit his bank note printing inventions and Angier March followed in 1821 to join his father in the printing business.McConnell (2004) Angier March eventually took charge of his father's business but in 1828 launched his own heating and steam engineering enterprise. He married Julia Georgina Brown in 1831 and in the same year filed the first of his patents for heating equipment. His first steam heating system was installed in 1832 in the home of Governor of the Bank of England John Horley Palmer so that the owner could grow grapes. He also installed heating systems in commercial premises. Angier March's business prospered and he moved to larger premises, sharing an office with his father who, though still inventive, enjoyed less commercial success. He ultimately became involved in improved methods for smelting iron and designs for piping and plumbing fittings. His high-pressure steam technology proved to have other uses, including a mobile baker's oven for the British Army.

He played a crucial role by popularizing science and technology in Croatia. He was also the president of Matica hrvatska and the author of several physics handbooks for primary school and a series of popular scientific works from the areas of physics, astronomy and electrical engineering. Youth He was born in Petrinja as the first of thirteen children of Ida and Franjo Kučera, a teacher. His son Vlaho later claimed that Oton was born on December 31, 1856, but that pragmatic reasons (such as the army service) prompted his parents to move the date by one day. Oton celebrated his birthday on January 1, as shown by the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1927. Oton's father was soon transferred, so the family left Petrinja and settled in Otočac, where Oton spent his childhood and completed five years of primary school. He attended the secondary school in Senj. Traveling over the mountain range of Velebit to reach Senj from Otočac, the young man discovered his love and interest for mountains and the starry sky. He continued his studies in Vinkovci, where he completed his secondary education in 1873. As an excellent and talented student, Oton was given the Krajina grant. He went to Vienna, where he studied physics, mathematics and astronomy, attending the lectures of the famous scientists Jožef Stefan, Ludwig Boltzmann and Johann Josef Loschmidt. He also went to the Vienna Observatory, which was managed by Karl von Litrow. He was offered the post of the assistant, but patriotic and family reasons brought him back to Vinkovci, where he started lecturing at the local Gymnasium at the age of 19. Two years later he passed the required teacher exam in Vienna. Early works In 1881 he published his first scientific works. Together with Spiridon Brusina and Gjuro Pilar, he founded the Croatian Society of Natural Sciences in Zagreb in the late 1885. He was still a teacher in Vinkovci. The Society published its Glasnik (Herald), where Kučera's first article, Man and Natural Science, can be found in 1886. It described the development of natural sciences. Having moved to Požega, Kučera started popularizing science, which he would do until his death. He founded the first observatory in Požega. In 1892, his first book of popular science was printed, Notes on Magnetism and Electricity. Popular science flourished in the 19th century Croatia, especially because the Croatian language became prominent in local science. Kučera played a crucial role in popularizing science. He is popularly called the \\"Croatian Flammarion\\" after his famous French counterpart. Kučera believed that man has the same relationship towards the stars as towards his homeland, and that astronomy makes people think about the fundamental questions of life and forget the low passions, which endows it with great educational value. The peak of his career When Kučera moved to Zagreb in 1892, it was the start of his most prolific period. He taught at the Realna Gymnasium, where he created the first modern lecture room for physics in 1893. In the same year, he published another book, Weather: Notes on Meteorology. In 1895, he wrote Our Sky, a book of popular astronomy published by Matica hrvatska in a printing run of 12,000 copies. It was received enthusiastically and printed two more times during his life (1921, 1930). It earned him the award of the foundation of the count Ivan Nepomuk Drašković. In 1995, a hundred years after it was first published, the book had its fourth edition in Zagreb. In 1899, Kučera wrote Physics for Beginners, a textbook with an appendix of astronomy and chemistry. He got his Ph.D. from the University of Zagreb with a work on Marin Getaldić and became a lecturer of higher mathematics, theoretical physics and mechanics at the Academy of Forestry in Zagreb, where he stayed until retirement in 1915. At the Academy, he introduced a two-year course of geodesy, which he managed during the first year. That course would later evolve into the Zagreb Faculty of Geodesy. In 1902, Kučera published Experimental Physics for Secondary Schools and initiated the astronomy section at the Croatian Society of Natural Sciences. Still lecturing at the academy, he accepted the position of the head of the Zagreb Observatory, created in 1903, which he had helped found. The astronomy section and the observatory were a great success, since they boosted the membership in the Society from 95 to 230. In 1924, Kučera became a member of the French Astronomical Society in Paris. His book Waves and Rays was published in 1903. In 1907 he translated two textbooks, Scheiner's Structure of Space and Walentin's Advanced Physics for Secondary School. Kučera was active in many other areas: he was the president of the first radio club, a member of the literary committee of Matica hrvatska, and the president of Matica from 1909 to 1917. From 1908 to 1911, he was the president of the Secondary School Teacher Society. He was a regular and popular lecturer at the Open University of Zagreb. Kučera was an editor of the Herald of the Croatian Mountaineering Society since its first issue. From 1892 to 1913 he was the secretary and then president of the Croatian Mountaineering Society. He was also a member of the Brethren of the Croatian Dragon, with the honorific title \\"Dragon of Petrinja\\", and a working member of the Croatian Literary Society of St. Jerome. Later life and family Kučera went into retirement in 1915. In 1920, after the fall of Austria-Hungary, he returned to work, becoming the government officer for secondary schools. He managed the Zagreb Observatory again from 1920 to 1925, when he went into retirement for the second time. From 1924 to 1926, he was the editor of Bošković, an astronomical calendar. Among many books he published in later life, the most important were published in the series of Modern Age Inventions: Movement and Forces. Notes on the Mechanics of Sky and Earth (1915) and Wireless Telegraph and Telephone (1925). His daughter from his first marriage, Elsa, became a renowned psychologist. When his first wife died, he remarried and had three more children: daughters Mara and Nevenka and son Vlaho. In the last years of his life, family reasons made him sell the family house at Jurjevska Street 14 in Zagreb and move to a rented apartment in Mallinova Street. He died in Zagreb and was buried in Mirogoj, the main city cemetery. Kučera made many contributions to the development of science and technology in Croatia, especially astronomy. When the Višnjan Observatory discovered its first asteroid on May 22, 1996, they named it (7364) Otonkucera. Matica hrvatska has an annual science award that bears his name.

The Space Farms museum houses an extensive variety of antique vehicles and items used during the early history of the United States, such as horse-drawn carriages and early motorcycles.Krebs, Michelle. \\"Driving Back in Time: Auto Exhibits in the Mid- Atlantic States\\", The New York Times, August 20, 2006. Accessed October 11, 2007. The vehicles are largely unrestored, being in much the same remarkable condition as when they were acquired. There are also colonial period tools and weapons on display. Children can feed young animals by hand and there is a large food and drink area for picnics. There is also a gift shop and playground area where people can explore nature without being in the wild. The atmosphere is very relaxed, with family members giving talks and performing (animal) infant feedings. Space Farms was named one of the Top 10 Worst Zoos by Parade Magazine in 1984. An article from the Associated Press about the list stated, \\"The 10 worst, 'animal slums' with bare, cell-like environments that can cause physical and emotional damage to animals, according to the magazine, were [...] Space Games Farm Zoo, Sussex, N.J.\\" More recently, enclosures have been designed for enhanced enrichment and privacy. In 2011, Space Farms built outside enclosures for two African Serval, that included locust tree branches and a privacy den, and for two South American Coati, with a branched tree and several boulders. In 2014, a new Kodiak Bear exhibit was scheduled to open.  Notes  Further reading  * Day, Lori S. The Zookeeper's Daughter PublishAmerica, 2004. * Day, Lori S.

As Nash Icon, it broadcasts a country music format and is under the ownership of Cumulus Media, which also owns the market's other country music outlet, KHKI. Its studios are located on 109th Street in Urbandale, while its transmitter is located on Northwest 100th Street on the border with Grimes and Johnston. History KJJY originally signed on the air February 4, 1978, as KANY in 1978 at 106.3, licensed to serve Ankeny, Iowa. On May 2, 1981, the station was sold by the Ankeny Broadcasting company to Fuller-Jeffrey Broadcasting, who later changed the call letters to KJJY and the format to country music. As KJJY, the station slowly built a following taking on the market's current country giant KSO, which had been the market's country leader on the AM band since 1972. KJJY fended off a challenge from KKXI in 1986, asserting its dominance in the FM country market. To further compete in the market, KJJY moved to 92.5 MHz in 1988 and received a power upgrade to 50,000 watts. The 106.3 frequency ceased at this time, but returned to the air in 1991. Today, KXNO-FM occupies the frequency. In 2003, Citadel Broadcasting, which had purchased KHKI, acquired KJJY from Wilks Broadcasting. The pairing has paid off for both stations, ratings and audience wise, without cannibalizing each other. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. At 3pm on August 15, 2014, KJJY became one of the first affiliates of the new \\"Nash Icons\\" network as \\"92.5 Nash Icon\\".

The boundaries of the site, laid out on the former Cattleugh's nursery gardens, are marked by Cadogan Square West, Milner Street, Lennox Gardens Mews, Walton Street and Pont Street.Not to be confused with the 18th century Brighton Prince of Wales Ground. The 1872 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described the ground as 'grand and quick and one of the finest playing grounds in England'. The first match played on the ground was Household Brigade v. Lords and Commons on 3 June 1871. Middlesex County Cricket Club used the ground between 1872 and 1876 and played their first match on 23–25 May 1872 against Yorkshire. The ground was also used by South of England and by Gentlemen of the South. Several Gentlemen v Players fixtures were also played there, the first taking place in July 1873. In 1878, the touring Australians played two matches on the ground: Gentlemen of England v Australians and Players v Australians (the last first-class match held on the ground, scheduled for 11 to 13 September but finished in two days). The increasing acquisition of portions of the site for building development, made possible by 'The Cadogan and Hans Place Improvement Act of 1874', discouraged its further use. The former first-class cricketer Thomas Box was employed as an attendant at the ground. On 12 July 1876, during the Middlesex v Nottinghamshire match, he collapsed.

It is commonly recited by Indians in unison at public events, especially in schools, and during the Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations. It is commonly found printed in the opening pages of school textbooks and calendars. It is recited in the morning assembly of most Indian schools. However, Pledge is the part of the Indian Constitution. The pledge was originally composed in Telugu language by writer Pydimarri Venkata Subba Rao in 1962. It was first read out in a school in Visakhapatnam in 1963 and was subsequently translated into various regional languages. Origin The Indian national pledge was composed by Pydimarri Venkata Subba Rao. Subbarao, a noted author in Telugu and a bureaucrat, composed the pledge while serving as the District Treasury Officer of Visakhapatnam District in 1962. He presented it to the senior Congress leader Tenneti Viswanadam who forwarded it to the then Education Minister P.V.G. Raju. Subba Rao was born in Anneparti, Nalgonda District, Telangana. He was an expert in Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi, English and Arabic languages. He worked as Treasury officer in the state of Hyderabad. After the formation of AP, He worked in Khammam, Nizamabad, Nellore, Visakhapatnam and Nalgonda Districts. The Pledge was introduced in many schools in 1963. The Indian National Pledge is commonly recited by Indians at public events, during daily assemblies in many Indian schools, and during the Independence Day and Republic Day commemoration ceremonies. Unlike the National Anthem or the National Song, whose authors are well known in India, P.V. Subbarao, the author of the pledge remains largely a little-known figure, his name being mentioned neither in the books nor in any documents. Records with the Human Resources Development Ministry of the Government of India however record Subbarao as the author of the pledge. Subbarao himself is thought to have been unaware of its status as the National Pledge with a position on par with the National Anthem and the National Song. Apparently, he came to know about this when his granddaughter was reading the pledge from her textbook. Wording The Pledge India is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sisters I love my country, and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage. I shall give respect to my parents, teachers and all the elders, and treat everyone with courtesy. To my country and my people, I pledge my devotion. In their well being and prosperity alone, lies my happiness.

It is the former seat of the Crawley-Boevey Baronets. History=Foundation and background Flaxley Abbey was founded in 1151 by Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford as a Cistercian monastery. It was allegedly founded on the spot where his father Milo, 1st Earl of Hereford was killed during a hunting in the Forest of Dean in 1143. The monks who built the abbey came from Bordesley Abbey founded in Worcestershire in 1138. In the late 12th century, it was noted that Pope Celestine III and Pope Alexander III granted the monks of Flaxley Abbey special immunity from tithes. The monastery came under royal protection during the reign of King Henry II and was used as a royal hunting quarters. In 1227 King Henry III gave a grant to Flaxley Abbey to the woods, called Abbot's Woods. King Edward III, who paid frequent visits to Flaxley Abbey, granted to Flaxley Abbey income from the rents and profits of the lands of the Forest of Dean in 1353.The cartulary and historical notes of the Cistercian abbey of Flaxley. Dissolution Flaxley Abbey was eventually dissolved during the Dissolution of the Monasteries on 4 September 1536. On 21 March 1537 the abbey and its lands were granted to Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower of London during much of the reign of Henry VIII, who superintended the execution of Queen Anne Boleyn. During this time the west and south wings of the abbey were converted into a manor.  The Crawley-Boevey family \\"Flaxley the seat of Mrs Bovey\\", Flaxley Abbey, 1712 engraving by Johannes Kip. Flaxley Abbey was purchased in 1648 by the London merchant, lawyer and philosopher James Boevey (1622–1696), with his half-brother William. Later resident Catherina Boevey, an inheritance from her short marriage to William Boevey (James Boevey's son), passed the house to Thomas Crawley (later styled Crawley- Boevey) at her death in 1727.'Flaxley', A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 5: Bledisloe Hundred, St. Briavels Hundred, The Forest of Dean (1996), pp. 138-150. Date accessed: 16 October 2010. The family was created as the Crawley-Boevey Baronets (originally Barrow Baronetcy) on 22 January 1784. During this time the house was substantially rebuilt by the designs of architect Anthony Keck. As baronets the manor and the estate continued to pass down from father to eldest son. Flaxley Abbey remained as the family home until 1960. Gardens and landscape After the death of William Boevey, his wife Catherina Boevey completed Dutch-style gardens on the grounds of Flaxley Abbey. It is said that Maynard I Colchester, a close friend of Catherina, was influenced by her own canal gardens for his Westbury Court Garden. The layout of the gardens and improvements to Flaxley Abbey were continued by her after her husband's death. However, due to the modification of the land, the Dutch- style gardens at Flaxley Abbey were eventually removed. Between 1962 and 1963 a new modern style garden as well as the manor's interior were redesigned by Tony Award winning theater and set designer Oliver Messel.

Monnig (September 4, 1902 - May 4, 1999) was an American amateur astronomer, acknowledged for his contributions to meteoritics. Private life Monnig was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the United States. In 1925 he received a law degree from the University of Texas. He worked for the family dry goods business and was its president from 1974 to 1981, when it was sold. In 1941 he married Juanita Mickle, who died in 1996. They had no children. Monnig died in the city where he was born on May 4, 1999. Astronomy In the 1920s Monnig started to be interested in astronomy. He founded the Texas Observers astronomy club and between 1931 and 1947 he published a monthly newsletter – the Texas Observers Bulletin – writing especially about issues of amateur astronomers' interest, such as variable stars, meteors, comets, and the planets. In the late-1920s, Monnig developed an interest in meteorites and their contribution to astronomers' studies on the origins of the Solar System. He was a founding member of the Society for Research on Meteorites (later renamed Meteoritical Society). Meteoritical collection In the early-1930s he started his own meteoritical collection. After he failed with his requests to be allowed to study meteorites at the Smithsonian Institution, the Field Museum, and the American Museum of Natural History, he increased his collecting effort. He questioned witnesses of meteoroid detonations or bolides and organized and financed searching expeditions. He paid 1 dollar per pound, a price that museums could not match at the time of the Great Depression. Gradually, his collection grew to be one of the largest private collections in the world: it contained about 3,000 specimens from 400 different meteorites. Probably the most valuable were two carbonaceous chondrites, found at Crescent, Oklahoma, in 1936 and at Bells, Texas, in 1961. Monnig later decided to donate the collection to Texas Christian University: he made a series of transfers, between 1976 and 1986. Nowadays, the collection contains over 1,000 different meteorites. In 2003, four years after he died, the Oscar E. Monnig Meteorite Gallery was opened, exhibiting about 10 per cent of the meteorites to the public. The numbering system Monnig used to label his collection is a topic of great intrigue, as scientists and meteorite specialists believe that Monnig's collection numbers are an \\"intriguing, perhaps almost magical...a tangible link with researchers and collectors who have gone before us,\\" as stated by Geoff Notkin. Scientists have concluded that it is likely that Monnig used a similar labeling system as Harvey H. Nininger. Awards In 1984, Monnig became the first person to win the Texas Star Party's annual 'Lone Stargazer Award' for his accomplishments as an observer in amateur astronomy In 1990, he received the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific for his contributions to meteoritics. The main belt asteroid 2780 Monnig was named in his honour.

Origins  Crown of Aragon The origins of military force in Catalonia date back to the thirteenth century, with the Sagramental, the brotherhood among several peoples to guarantee their own security, made by oath, and, therefore, called this way. Though they were institutionalised during the reign of James I, they had already been legislated in writing during the 11th century. In Catalonia, the usage Princeps namque established the requirement that every man participate in the national defense in the event of external threat. The history of the Mediterranean has often tasted Catalan weapons, from Murcia to Athens and Neopatria (Great Catalan Company), but also to old Catalonia, before and after the Nueva Planta decrees (1716). The Catalans have been organized spontaneously militarily in many different ways, from the Sagramental, the Crusades of the Almogavars to the maulets, the submissive ones, or the maquis. Until the Nueva Planta decrees, in Catalan homes there were always weapons and ammunition to defend themselves, either from the Saracens, the pirates or the French. It is not therefore until after the defeat of the War of the Spanish Succession that the new Bourbon authorities limited and controlled the right to bear arms, and under the pretext of pacifying the country, it hides the desire to prevent citizens from rising in Weapons against it, as had happened many times.Vegeu Guerra de Successió Espanyola, derrota i repartiment de Catalunya i els fets anteriors, en aquest mateix article.

In addition, the Catalan constitutions, abolished in fact by the Decree, forced the Crown to negotiate the popular support, represented by the arm seal (an institution that convened the Provincial Council of the General in an extraordinary way in cases of emergency or urgency) of the catalan courts, support that they often granted in exchange for privileges, which limited the royal authority. This balance of powers disappears after the defeat, and humiliation becomes apparent in many ways, such as the demolition of La Ribera quarter, where there was more resistance, the construction of the fortress of the Ciutadella in the same place, the imposition of the Cadastre, or the closure of all Catalan universities. For this reason, when they saw the difference of the concept of royal authority in Castile, the Catalans rose up with Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, handed out posters of propaganda and negotiated with England.

The deplorable History of The catalans written by Queen Anne of England or The case of the catalansdocument of several European foreign ministries reflect that abandonment. The Crown of Aragon has been considered an empire which ruled in the Mediterranean for hundreds of years, with the power to set rules over the entire sea(for instance, the Llibre del Consolat del Mar or Book of the Consulate of the Sea, written in Catalan, is one of the oldest compilation of maritime laws in the world).

He represented Tenali in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly for four consecutive terms from 1952 to 1965. Alapati_Venkatramaiah Early life Venkataramaiah was born on 9 September 1917 to a very rich agricultural family in the village of Edlapalli, about seven kilometres from Tenali Town in Guntur district. His parents were Alapati Anjaiah Garu and Smt Chellamma Garu. In those years when there were no proper schools in the villages, Sri Alapati Venkataramaiah Garu completed only primary school. But as a generous and kind-hearted person he knew the needs of the community, in fact some elders say his lack of higher education was a blessing in disguise in some ways as it left him pure and simple. When his well-wishers mentioned to him that having a degree would have helped him, he used to say that to live honestly and fulfill one's responsibilities effectively that degrees were not required. Early career As an animal lover he enjoyed conducting races for bulls and horse carts in his village in the name of eminent freedom fighter Desoddaraka Kasinathuni Nageswara Rao in 1940. That was the first time races were held on such a large scale in Guntur district. He conducted Kabaddi and volleyball tournaments also in his twenties. Attracted by the freedom struggle going on in the country he took part in the Quit India movement in 1942. He worked undercover supplying money, clothes and food to the people participating in the movement. He along with Bayankarachari and Seshagiri Rao were a trio who worked closely. In one such operation while he was on his way back from Alipore camp jail after meeting some freedom fighters, he was arrested by Police with 3 revolvers on him. He was arrested and kept in Bellary police station. He had a childhood friend who was the Munsif in the Hospet court on whose guarantee he was released on bail. This laid a very good foundation for his career in the Congress party. One notable and memorable fact that made the Congress party take notice of this young dynamic leader was his victory in the first Madras Legislative Assembly Elections of 1952. There was a big communist wave sweeping across the Telugu land and political stalwarts such as Kasu Bramhananda Reddy, Kalluri Chandramouli, Kakani Venkatratnam, Yarlagadda Sivaram Prasad, Bezwada Gopal Reddy and Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy all lost this election. Out of 17 seats in the combined Guntur and Prakasam district, the Congress party could only win 4 seats, with the Communists and Socialists winning the remaining 13. But Mr Alapati won his seat with a majority of over 8,000 votes, leading to the popular moniker of the 'Iron Man' in Guntur District. His seniors both in age and politically were Mr Kala Venkata Rao, Mr Mantena Venkat Raju, Mr Kalluri Chandramouli and his guide, mentor and best friend Mr Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy. They were fondly called the Pancha Pandavas with Mr Alapati the youngest of them. Highlights and important events in his Life 09/08/1942 Entered the Quit India Movement. 1946 Organized a stop for the special train taking Gandhiji near his village and ensured thousands of people could get a glimpse of Mahatma. 25/01/1950 Unanimously elected as the chairman of Guntur District Cooperative Central Bank and continued to be re elected for 5 times in the same post until 1962. 1952 Elected as MLA in the first ever Assembly elections after Independence.

Proved himself as an able administrator by Amending the old Municipal act. Envisioned, planned and laid the foundation for KPHB Housing colony Phase I and II in Hyderabad by convincing the CM and the state cabinet against heavy odds due to its distance from the city back then. 'S.R Nagar' built in the name of his mentor and friend was his pet project, to which many people in the colony acknowledge him till date and proof of his far sightedness. Planned and implemented the beautification of TankBund in Hyderabad. The Bund was widened to include gardens and a Restaurant. As part of first phase 1.5 km of Bund was widened and more money was to be allocated in the next budget before he died. As Municipal Administration and Housing minister he considered 'Vizag' as his second home. Major developments he did during his tenure was the expansion of Tatipudi Reservoir to supply drinking water to city and also to the steel plant. In those days the beach road between Harbour and Andhra university was not connected end to end there was Indian navy's Coastal battery in the middle, people had to travel an extra 1.5 km. The Navy was unwilling to part with land to the Vizag corporation to connect the missing link. A Sardarji was the Navy official Mr Alapati appointed another Sardarji Mr Ajith singh as commissioner of Vizag. Both the Sardar's worked and Mr Alapati was successful in acquiring Navy land and connect the road end to end. He also had built quarters for professors in Vizag medical college. Kirlampudi layout was developed during his tenure. 24/05/1964 Took oath as Endowments Minister in Mr Kasu Brahmananda Reddy Cabinet in addition to Municipal administration portfolio he already had. This proves the trust the party and specifically Mr. Brahmananda Reddy who was considered his opponent (same district) had on his abilities. Took the initiative of amending the 1930 Endowments Act and entrusted the powers to Endowment department. His cabinet colleagues included Marri Chenna Reddy, Raja Yarlagadda Sivaram Prasad, M R Apparao, PVG Raju, Gurumurthy,P.V.Narasimha Rao and Mrs Sadalakshmi Developments in Tenali during Alapati's Tenure 1959 Built RanaRanga Chowk in Tenali a memorial for 7 people who lost their lives in Police firing near Railway station during the Quit India Movement. 1962 Built the Railway overbridge in Tenali.

And also the only one who was Municipal Chairman, Dist Co operative bank Chairman, District congress President and an MLA all simultaneously. Such a towering personality he was among the masses and his peers.

She was also the first woman and directly elected Guntur Zilla Parishad chairman in 1987.

The Cisternoni of Livorno are a series of three large buildings in the neoclassical style at Livorno, in Tuscany, Italy. They were constructed between 1829 and 1848 as part of a complex of purification plants and storage tanks to the Leopoldino aqueduct; a fourth cisternone planned at Castellaccia was never built. The cisternoni, literally \\"great cisterns\\", provided Livorno -- a city that is still today one of the principal ports of the Mediterranean -- with fresh and, more importantly, clean water throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Designed by the architect Pasquale Poccianti, the cisternoni are architecturally important, as they represent the advent of an aesthetically considered approach to the design of utilitarian public work. This movement, whose followers are sometimes known as \\"Utopians\\", was pioneered by such architects as Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude-Nicolas Ledoux at the close of the 18th century.Vidler, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux: Architect of the Revolution Between Vision and Utopia. The movement resulted in great palaces and temples of industry and commerce, their palatial and temple-like facades concealing the mundane reality of their true use, which were to dominate many towns and landscapes from the 19th century onwards.  Acquedotto Leopoldino  Acquedotto Leopoldino. The Acquedotto Leopoldino (also known as the \\"Acquedotto di Colognole\\") and the neoclassical cisterns of Livorno were part of a sophisticated scheme to not only provide water to Livorno, but also clean it. The scheme was centred on the long aqueduct which runs south to north bringing water to the city from Colognole. This feat of engineering first carried water to the city in 1816, long before its completion. It was Livorno's sole water supply until 1912, still serving some areas of the city. The aqueduct was commissioned in 1792 by Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Construction began in 1793 to plans drawn by the architect Giuseppe Salvetti, replacing an earlier aqueduct constructed in the 16th century by Ferdinand de' Medici. Work stopped in 1799 on the death of Salvetti and, because of the political difficulties and upheavals in Tuscany caused by the first disruptive phases of the Napoleonic occupation of Tuscany, did not resume until 1806, when Maria Louisa, regent of Etruria, acting for her infant son, appointed the architect Riccardo Calocchieri to supervise the work. Later, in 1809, during the French occupation of Tuscany and reign of Elisa Bonaparte, Poccianti was appointed by the newly formed \\"Comune of Livorno\\" to oversee the project and under his direction work continued until 1824, the date usually considered as that of the aqueduct's completion. However, modifications were always being implemented, and after Poccianti's death in 1858, the project was continued by his successor Angiolo della Valle. The aqueduct crosses valleys in the Livorno Hills, supported on great arches which tower above the forests and slopes of macchie below.  Pasquale Poccianti  Villa del Poggio Imperiale with the facade envisaged and drawn by Pasquale Poccianti. Pasquale Poccianti, the reservoirs' architect, was \\"Engineer to the Commune of Livorno\\" and \\"Architect of the Royal Works\\". Poccianti had trained at Florence's Accademia di Belle Arti. In his capacity as court architect, Poccianti worked on many prominent Tuscan buildings both private and municipal, including the grand ducal residence, the Palazzo Pitti. Poccianti was a keen disciple of the architect Gaspare Maria Paoletti, who had redesigned much of the Villa del Poggio Imperiale leaving only the main facade unchanged. In 1807, Giuseppe Cacialli redesigned the principal facade of the Villa from drawings by Poccianti.Villa del Poggio Imperiale retrieved 17 August 2007 In their use of monumental neoclassical architecture for industrial buildings, the Livorno cisterns can be compared with works of radical French neoclassicists Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. Thus their dominating, over-scaled proportions emphasize the new prominence which was to be given throughout the 19th century to functional buildings proving mundane services -- not only celebrating the innovations of the forthcoming industrial age but attempting to realise the Utopian approach to town planning envisaged from the late 18th century. Previously such buildings, when they existed, had been given little aesthetic architectural consideration and had often been hidden from view or, when unavoidably visible, disguised to conceal their true use. Occasionally the disguise could draw more attention than necessary, as was the case with the pumping station designed by Ludwig Persius built in Sanssouci Park in 1842, which was disguised as a grandiose mosque complete with minarets.  La Gran Conserva  \\"La Gran Conserva\\" of Livorno designed in 1829 The 1766 design by Ledoux for Marie-Madeleine Guimard's Parisian mansion with a similar niche to that of the Gran Cisternone. Ledoux's plans for the ideal city of Chaux: The \\"House of Supervisors\\" at the source of the Loue. Published in 1804. The River Inspector's house straddles the river. La Gran Conserva, or \\"Il Cisternone\\", situated on what were the outskirts of 19th-century Livorno, is the largest and best known of the city's's covered cisterns. It was constructed between 1829 and 1842 to the design of Pasquale Poccianti. While the facade of the Cisternone was completed by 1833 to commemorate the marriage of Tuscany's ruling Grand Duke Leopoldo II to his second wife Maria Antonietta, the water system was not fully operational until 1842. It is thought that the architect, Antonio Antolini (better known for his work at the Bonaparte Forum in Milan, a circular piazza of palazzi with the Castello Sforzesco at its centre)M. Giulia Marziliano, Giovanni Antonio Antolini architetto e ingegnere (1753 - 1841). Faenza Editrice, Faenza - Bologna 2000. may have also been involved in the design, as correspondence between him and Poccianti regarding the Cisternone exists.F. Gurrieri and L. Zangheri (eds.) (1977), Pasquale Poccianti architetto, 1774 - 1858\\\\. Contributi al convegno per la celebrazione del secondo centenario della nascita, Firenze, p.39. The building appears almost surreal in its design, due to its dominant dome which resembles more a \\"cut- away\\" illustrative architectural drawing, a section, than a realised project. Inspired by the Pantheon in Rome the \\"dome\\" is unique, appearing as a half- dome or \\"semi-cupola.\\" It is in reality an enormous niche -- open to the elements -- thus it seems that one views the interior from the exterior. A similar, but less theatrical, construction can be seen crowning the classical temple front of Alberti's Basilica of Sant'Andrea in Mantua, built in 1470. At Livorno, the great niche surmounts a massive portico supported by eight columns in the Tuscan order, the order theorists considered most appropriate to military architecture. Attention is drawn to the niche by its proportions which dwarf the lower floors beneath it. One explanation for the individuality of the great niche is that large niches and concave recesses ornamenting pediments were a defining feature of Italian Baroque architecture. In Italy the Baroque style was superseded more swiftly by the neoclassical style than elsewhere in Europe; thus there can be found a confusing blend of the two styles in parts of Italy. However, the Gran Cisterno is very late for this fusion of styles, so the influence of Ledoux seems the most likely reason for this magnificently eccentric feature. There are obvious similarities between the Gran Conserva and Ledoux's drawings for the \\"House of Supervisors\\" at his idealistic vision of the city of Chaux, a late 18th-century example of modern town planningThis theory is explored further in D. Matteoni (1992), Pasquale Poccianti e l'acquedotto di Livorno, Roma - Bari. and more obviously still in a design by Ledoux for a Parisian mansion for Marie-Madeleine Guimard, which was conceived as early as 1766. In its turn, the Gran Cisternone was to be the inspiration for the design of half-dome Beaux-Arts bandshells, such as the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park, New York.Naumberg Concerts . The interior of the building is divided into two halves. The first and most visible is the principal facade and its flanking wings, which house the apartments for caretakers and staff; behind lies the second half and main body of the building which contains the \\"T\\" shaped reservoir itself. This is subdivided by Tuscan columns supporting the roof above, giving it the air of a cavernous aquatic cathedral. The cisterns were not only places for storing the city's water but were also \\"purgatori\\" -- places for purifying the water. Water entered the reservoir from the Acquedotto Leopoldino through layers of gravel and carbon, a method of filtration which was later replaced by a more modern chlorine treatment system. The later removal of the gravel filtering system meant that the cistern could be used to its maximum capacity to store 10,000 cubic metres of water. This reservoir and purification plant is still in use today.  Cisternino di Pian di Rota  Cisternino di Pian di Rota designed in 1827 Villa Badoer designed by Palladio in 1557 The smaller Cisternino di Pian di Rota, in the Pian di Rota area of the city, was begun in 1845, although it had been planned as early as 1827. While, like the architect's other works, it is strictly speaking in the neoclassical style, the Cisternino di Pian di Rota also has the air of a Palladian villa of the Veneto. The symmetrical facade is dominated by a massive prostyle portico clearly based on that of the Pantheon in Rome while the composition of the facade could be emulating Scamozzi's Villa Rocca Pisani or Palladio's Villa Badoer. Whatever the inspiration, the architect's vision of achieving Utopian ideals in architecture by emulating the temples of antiquity is very evident. Such philosophies had been advocated and popularised in the paintings of the idealised Italian landscape by Claude, Poussin and Dughet. A temple similar to the Cisternino di Pian di Rota had been built in the 1750s as a garden folly in the gardens at Stourhead in England.While the Stourhead \\"Pantheon\\" has a rotunda, their facades are almost identical. Stourhead Landscape Garden. The National Trust 2000. P 14. The interior houses the large rectangular reservoir, originally divided into two, as with the other cisternoni. One half houses a filtration system of beds of gravel and carbon. The roof of the reservoir is supported by 28 Tuscan columns.  Cisternino di città  Cisternino di città is an austere neoclassical design which was approved in 1837 and completed in 1848. The design was greatly altered during its construction: originally the close proximity of neighbouring buildings meant that only one facade would be visible, but alteration and demolitions in the city during 1840 caused the building to face two different new thoroughfares. The result of the redesign was a great loggia supported by ionic columns raised above a heavy base pierced only by sparse and narrow windows. The sides of the building are embellished by apses with lunette windows. The \\"Cisternino di città\\" in the centre of Livorno was also designed by Pasquale Poccianti. This severe almost startling form of neoclassicism had become popular in the first decade of the 19th century. It was pioneered by such architects as Peter Speeth and Friederich Gilly and is in contrast to the more elegant neoclassicism of such architects as Robert Adam and John Nash. This form of street architecture was most popular in Germany, where it was used to great effect in such squares as Munich's Theresienwiese. This building was never used for its intended purpose and has been used in several different roles. Most recently it has since 1945 served as Livorno's cultural centre.  Cisternoni  Cisternoni are not peculiar to Livorno; they have been constructed from Roman times in many other locations in Italy. Most notably in Albano Laziale in the 3rd century AD, and Spasiano in Sorrento. Both of these examples, like the comparatively new Gran Conserva, are today still in use. Like their earlier counterparts the Cisternoni of Livorno are today places of public interest. References Sources * F. Borsi, G. Morolli, L.

The name Langstrothdale derives from Old English and translates as 'long marsh' or 'marshy ground'. The dale was first colonised by Anglians in the seventh century, with Norse invaders arriving later. In Norman times, many of the isolated settlements were allowed to remain, but were prevented from expanding by an arcane ruling known as the 'Forest Law'. At that time, Langstrothdale was well forested, and the upper northern part of the dale (which is now moorland) was a royal hunting forest known as Langstrothdale Chase or as the 'Forest of Langstroth'. The dale became part of the lands owned by the Clifford family and in 1604, due to the then Earl of Clifford's 'extravagances', the lands were sold to pay off his debts. This allowed many Dalesfolk to purchase their own farmsteads. In the age before mass transportation, the road through the dale was part of a packhorse route from Lancaster to Newcastle upon Tyne.

Until recently a special school located here was known as Abbotsford School, but has since been renamed as The Bridge.

Thomson played in 548 league matches, scoring 194 league goals in a career that saw him play for Queen of the South, Partick Thistle, Falkirk and Stenhousemuir in Scotland and Southend United, Oxford United, Gillingham and Queens Park Rangers in England. Playing career=Queen of the South (First spell) Thomson signed on 28 July 1989 for Dumfries club Queen of the South from Motherwell-based boys' club Jerviston as an 18-year-old. As Thomson became more experienced the goals started to flow and never stopped in his five seasons at Palmerston Park. Arguably his finest achievement with Queens was the 1990–91 Scottish League Cup run to the quarter finals, where Queens eliminated higher division opponents Dundee and Dunfermline Athletic, before being defeated by a late goal versus Celtic at Parkhead. Thomson scored 109 goals in all competitions during his first spell in Dumfries, with 93 of those goals scored in 175 league appearances. In season 1993–94, Thomson was Queens Player of the Year and was also awarded the Scottish Second Division's Player of the Year Award, that he also won for the 1991–92 season. Thomson was also Scottish football's top scorer for the 1993–94 season. Aberdeen offered \\"Queens\\" £150,000 for Thomson but the club rejected the \\"Dons\\"' bid. Southend United then offered £250,000 and a deal was agreed between the two clubs that led to Thomson leaving for Essex on 4 July 1994 to join Peter Taylor's Shrimpers at Roots Hall. As well as being a record transfer fee paid at that particular time by the \\"Shrimpers\\", this still remains the highest fee received by Queens. Andy Thomson returned to Scotland to play for a Queen of the South Select on 23 April 1995. The opposition in the 2–2 draw was Rangers in a match to mark Queens' 75th anniversary and the opening of the new East Stand. Other guests for Queens included Ted McMinn, Davie Irons and Rowan Alexander.\\"The Queens\\" by Iain McCartney on Creedon Publications, 2004 Southend United and Oxford United Thomson played for Southend United from season 1994–95 until 1997–98, where he scored 28 goals in 122 league appearances, then spent the 1998–99 season playing for Oxford United, where he scored 7 goals in 38 league appearances. Gillingham Thomson signed for Gillingham on 5 August 1999 for £25,000 just before the season started. Peter Taylor had now signed Thomson for the second time in his managerial career and later described the transfer deal as the best £25,000 he had ever spent. On 28 May 2000, Thomson scored the winning goal for Gillingham in the Football League Second Division play-off final at Wembley Stadium. Thomson had come on as an extra time substitute in the 97th minute of the game. Thomson scored with two minutes of play left on the clock. Following Ty Gooden's centre from the left, the diving Thomson stole in front of Stuart Balmer to glance the ball into the far corner of the net. The goal was reminiscent of Keith Houchen's cup final goal for Coventry City versus Tottenham Hotspur. The 3–2 win versus Wigan Athletic ensured the Kent club's first ever promotion to the second tier of English football. The club's website described the goals as, \\"The most iconic moment in the long history of Gillingham Football Club encapsulated in a few moments of extra time football\\". Thomson became the second former \\"Queens\\" player to win a Wembley play-off final after Ted McMinn. Thomson also scored four goals in Gillingham's 1999-00 FA Cup run, versus Cheltenham Town, Walsall, Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday. The \\"Gills\\" were knocked out of the FA Cup in the quarter finals, the first time they had ever reached so far, at Stamford Bridge, when they lost 5–0 to Chelsea. Thomson scored 14 goals in 52 league appearances for the \\"Gills\\" in his two seasons at Priestfield, which were 1999-00 and 2000–01.

Thomson added, \\"Norman Blount was an excellent chairman.\\" During his second spell at Palmerston Park, Thomson scored 5 goals in 27 league appearances and overall, Thomson scored 114 goals in his two spells in Dumfries and is currently the fifth highest all-time goalscorer for the Doonhamers.

Trefentanil is most similar to short-acting fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil. In comparative studies, trefentanil was slightly more potent and shorter acting than alfentanil as an analgesic, but induced significantly more severe respiratory depression. For this reason trefentanil has not been adopted for clinical use, although it is still used in research. Trefentanil has very similar effects to alfentanil, much like those of fentanyl itself but more potent and shorter lasting. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear. The risk of respiratory depression is especially high with potent fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil and trefentanil, and these drugs pose a significant risk of death if used outside of a hospital setting with appropriate artificial breathing apparatus available.
