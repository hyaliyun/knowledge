A nursing sow in a farrowing crate. Fish meal factory Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat is a 2014 non-fiction book by Philip Lymbery and Isabel Oakeshott. It surveys the effects of industrial livestock production and industrial fish farming around the world. The book is the result of Lymbery's investigations for which he travelled the world over three years. Isabel Oakeshott is the political editor of The Sunday Times, Philip Lymbery is CEO of Compassion in World Farming. The book was published by Bloomsbury. Synopsis The thesis examined in the book is that globalised production chains of industrialised agricultural systems negatively affect farmed animals, human health, the countryside, rivers and oceans, biodiversity in rainforests and many of the world's poorest people. The authors seek to shed light on the conditions in intensive agriculture which, according to them, often differ from the image that the industry wants to sell to the public. Intensification in animal farming goes along with a growing demand of cropland to grow animal feed ‚Äì factory farming is thus not a means to save space.Farmageddon by Philip Lymbery with Isabel Oakeshott ‚Äì review, Lucy Siegle, The Observer, 2 February 2014Farmageddon by Philip Lymbery with Isabel Oakeshott, review, Tom Fort, The Daily Telegraph, 10 February 2014 They argue consequently that to feed the world population factory farming is not the solution but a threat, not least since more than a third of the world's arable harvests are being used to supply farmed animals.Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat by Philip Lymbery ‚Äì review, Tristram Stuart, The Guardian, 31 January 2014 According to the book the consumer price of cheap meat does not include the overall costs of industrial meat production.Farmageddon, website of Philip Lymbery The reader follows Lymbery's journey from his start in California's Central Valley. There he finds dairies where 10,000 cows can be milked at once.Farmageddon, first chapter (online), p.19 He travels to enormous piggeries in China and visits the fishmeal industry of Peru, which converts millions of tonnes of anchovies to fishmeal for supplying the livestock industry with feed.Farmageddon by Philip Lymbery (with Isabel Oakeshott): Book review, Mike McCarthy, The Independent, 7 February 2014 In Taiwan he visits a farm (labelled \\"organic\\") where 300,000 laying hens are being starved and held in batteries. A visit is paid to the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, US where he finds the marine ecosystem impacted by waste from the poultry industry. The author talks to a community in Mexico in an area dominated by pig sheds. There he documents a lake of effluent and air and water pollution, and discusses the outbreak of swine flu. One chapter of Farmageddon is dedicated to the question \\"What happened to the vet?\\" Lymbery says that veterinarians work in an industry with an \\"inbuilt flaw\\". He states that veterinarians often comply with the industrialization of animals, for example in the prophylactic use of antibiotics which are applied in the mass production of animals, eggs and milk instead of demanding a different (pasture-based) agricultural system. According to Lymbery veterinarians should not support systems that are \\"inherently bad for animal welfare\\", which allegedly is the case in \\"mass production of broiler chickens, caged production of eggs, the large-scale permanent housing of dairy cows (so- called mega dairies) and highly intensive pig production where mothering pigs are kept in confinement where they can't turn around for weeks at a time\\".\\"Have vets really sold out to industrial agri-business?\\", Lucy Siegle, The Guardian, 19 January 2014 In order to prevent Farmageddon the authors come up with suggestions for consumers, policy makers and farmers: Consumers should eat less meat. Fish should be fed to people rather than converted into fishmeal. Animals should be fed with grass and animal farming should be a pasture-based system. These changes would save resources by reducing the competition of humans and animals for food and land. Reception Tristram Stuart wrote in a review for The Guardian that although he is critical towards the \\"orthodoxy that large-scale farms and industrial agricultural technology are inherently wrong\\", \\"this catalogue of devastation will convince anyone who doubts that industrial farming is causing ecological meltdown\\".

The name  Sima was an acronym, the letters standing for \\"Soci√©t√© Industrielle de Mat√©riel Automobile\\". Violet respected the creator of the cars, Marcel Violet.  The business  The company was founded at Courbevoie on the northwestern side of Paris, in a part of the city which was already home to numerous automobile manufacturers and suppliers. Marcel Violet who created the little vehicle was a long-standing advocate of two-stroke air-cooled boxer-format engines, and these powered the cyclecars that carried his name Sima Violet ended production in 1929, to be succeeded at their Courbevoie site by the Sima-Standard business which survived till 1932.  The cars  The only vehicle produced was a cyclecar, which was a four-wheeled vehicle lighter than a conventional passenger car, but with a two-stroke engine and light-weight construction reminiscent of a motor cycle. In the years following the First World War the French government used taxation policy to encourage cyclecars. The Sima-Violet cyclecar was powered by a two-stroke twin-cylinder air-cooled engine of 497cc mounted in a low-slung position ahead of the driver. Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a two speed transmission mounted on the rear-axle. The quoted top speed for a standard vehicle was 110 km/h (68 mph). The Sima-Violet appeared at the Paris Motor Show in October 1924 at which time the only body-style listed was a steel-frame \\"Torpedo\\" type 2-seater, sitting on a wheelbase, and which the manufacturer was listing at a price of 4,950 francs. A single seater sports bodied version was also produced. The front wheels were suspended using a transversely mounted leaf-spring, combined with \\"friction shock-absorbers\\". The brakes operated only on the rear wheels. By the time of its final show appearance at the 22nd Paris Motor Show in October 1928 the car had acquired what appears to be a vertically mounted radiator at the front, but was still reportedly powered by a flat-twin motor-cycle style engine. The twin-cylinder air-cooled boxer-format motor was mounted in a low slung position at the front of the vehicle.

Finland's Bandy Association (Finnish: Suomen J√§√§palloliitto, Swedish: Finlands Bandyf√∂rbund) is the governing body for the sport of bandy in Finland. Bandy was one of the sports for which the Ball Association of Finland, founded in 1907, was created. The present Finnish Bandy Association was founded on 18 March 1972, to take over bandy from the Ball Association of Finland, which from then on concentrated on association football only. History Bandy came to Finland from St. Petersburg in Russia in the 1890s. The first club was Viborgs Skridskoklubb in Vyborg, which was Finnish back then. At the Nordic Games held in Sweden in 1901 (a predecessor of the Winter Olympic Games), bandy was included in the programme and in 1907, similar winter games were held in Helsinki and bandy was again included. Finland was represented by the club Polyteknikkojen Urheiluseura (PUS) at the 1907 games, but the winner of the competition was a combined team from Sweden, which defeated PUS as well as the team from St. Petersburg. The first Finnish Championships were played in 1908; in the finals, PUS beat Helsingin IFK 8-3. Bandy was the first team sport, for which a Finnish championship was created. Finland became independent in 1918 and Finland's first international as an independent country was against Sweden in 1919, which Finland won 4-1. The first game between two ladies' teams known to have been played in Finland was in March 1916, √Öbo Simklubb vs Helsingfors Damhockeyklubb, 3-1. Finland was one of the founding members of the Federation of International Bandy in 1955 and in 1957 the very first Bandy World Championship was held at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. In 2008 the Finnish bandy league, Bandyliiga, celebrated its 100th anniversary.

The projection method is a slight variant of the Gauss‚ÄìKr√ºger series development for the ellipsoidal transverse Mercator projection.

It would be led by Romanov pretender Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen as Emperor Nicholas III, with Bakov serving as Archchancellor. By 2017, Bakov had alleged to have held talks with the heads of several countries in order to purchase a territory in which to establish a legitimate, \\"non-micro\\"state. These have included Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, The Gambia, Antigua and Barbuda, and Kiribati.

On 24 February 2017, the Kiribati government rejected Bakov's proposal for the islands. Bakov later claimed it wasn't the final decision and that it was related to an inner Kiribati political struggle. On 1 December 2017, the Memorandum of Friendship and Cooperation between The Republic of The Gambia and the Romanov Empire was, according to Bakov, signed in Banjul by the Secretary General of The Gambia, Dawda Fadera, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romanov Empire, Modou Lamin Saidykhan, and on 6 December Bakov stated that the Romanov Empire was in talks with five other undisclosed countries. However, on 12 December The Gambia denied that such a memorandum was ever signed.

The 17 claimed territories include the entire continent of Antarctica and land under the jurisdiction of Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other nations. Bakov declared himself prime minister and announced a constitution and state symbols.

It does not claim land that was part of the historical Russian Empire that is now part of Finland, Poland, or the former Soviet republics. In June 2012, Bakov registered the Monarchist Party with the Russian Ministry of Justice, with a stated goal of restoring the monarchy to Russia in accordance with law. It is the only legalised monarchist party in Russia.

Accession of Prince Karl Emich  Anton Bakov and Karl Emich signing founding documents for the Imperial Throne On 31 March 2014, under the new name of the Imperial Throne, the micronation issued a manifesto announcing itself a sovereign nation and declaring that Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen (born 1952) had become its head with the title of Nicholas III, Emperor of All Russia, as a successor to Nicholas II. The title claim emerged upon the Prince's conversion from Lutheranism to Eastern Orthodox Christianity on 1 June 2013. Karl Emich descends from the House of Romanov through his grandmother, Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna (1907-1951), eldest child of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, who in 1924 claimed the Russian crown from exile following the execution of his cousin Nicholas II in 1918. The Imperial Throne claimed that by his conversion, Prince Karl Emich had fulfilled the accession requirements of Articles 35 and 53 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire last established in 1906. Prince Karl Emich accepted the Orthodox name \\"Nikolai Kirillovich\\"(–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª–æ–≤–∏—á) to become Nicholas III, and his (third) wife, n√©e Countess Isabelle von und zu Egloffstein, who also converted, accepted the name\\"Yekaterina Fyodorovna\\" (–ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∞).

The flag of the empire is the St. Andrew's Cross, which was the Russian Navy Ensign, The St. Andrew's Cross flag is also currently used as the party flag for the Monarchist Party of The Russian Federation, which Anton Bakov is the President and Chairman of said party. With the transformation into the Imperial Throne, the coat of arms was changed to a black Russian Imperial Eagle with the Chi Rho symbol in the escutcheon. Bakov emphasized the Chi Rho symbolizes the formation of the Christian Monarchy in the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great who saw the symbol in the skies before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 AD.

The multiplex was constructed in 1993 on the site of what was previously the Warner West End cinema. History The site was previously occupied by Daly's Theatre, which opened on 27 June 1893; following acquisition by Warner Brothers, this was demolished in 1937, to build a new 1,789-seat cinema, which opened on 12 October 1938 showing The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn. Known as the Warner Theatre, its architects were Thomas Somerford and E.A. Stone, and it featured a facade of reconstructed marble panels, with large relief panels in each top corner by Bainbridge Copnall depicting the spirits of sight and sound. Its single auditorium was a 2 level design, with a circle balcony, and its sidewalls were fitted with asbestos panels, perforated with large holes, over acoustic absorption. In 1970, the original auditorium was subdivided at a cost of $1.5 million to form 2 screens, known as the Warner West End (with 800 seats) and the Rendezvous Warner West End (with 700 seats). The Warner West End opened 29 October 1970 with the British premiere of There Was a Crooked Man... starring Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda, and the Rendezvous opened 12 November with the world premiere of The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer. A third auditorium, built in the former bar area, was added in 1974, with the screens now numbered 1-3. In 1975 Screen 2 was subdivided into 2 auditoria, and a 5th auditorium was added in 1981. The whole complex became known as the Warner West End. Following its closure on 12 September 1991, the 1938 building was almost entirely demolished, but with the retention of, in particular, most of the front facade. A new 9 screen multiplex was constructed having a total capacity of 2,482, opening on 23 September 1993 with a Royal premiere of The Fugitive. The architect was HGP Greentree Allchurch Evans with Higgs and Hill as the main contractor. A new glass fronted staircase was woven into the existing facade, which also featured a new canopy, and above, two vertical stacks of large single line monochromic LED dot matrix displays. Auditorium fit-outs were typical of the time with grey coloured Soundfold pleated wall coverings over acoustic absorption, but also featured art deco proscenium details and orange/gold coloured tabs. The main foyer is on the ground floor, with a large bar area on the 1st floor. A series of escalators enable access to all levels, with Screens 1-4 accessed from the basement, 5 from the ground floor, 6 and 7 from the 2nd floor, and 8 and 9 from the 4th floor. JBL cinema speakers were used throughout the complex, with the two main auditoria, Screens 5 and 7, being THX certified and featuring JBL 4675 screen speakers, 4645 subwoofers and 8330 surround speakers. Playback of all the major 35mm digital sound formats was available, i.e. Dolby Digital, DTS and SDDS, with Screen 7 in particular equipped for all three systems. Following a joint venture between Warner Bros. International Theatres and Village Cinemas, the complex became the Warner Village West End, and after the acquisition of Warner Village in 2003, it has been known as Vue West End. Some of the publicly accessible areas, particularly the foyer and lobby areas, were redecorated in subsequent years, and the large frontage rows of monochrome LED dot matrix displays were initially replaced with printed advertising, and subsequently colour LED displays. Digital projection was installed, Martin Audio speakers replaced the JBL installations, and THX certification was eventually dropped, initially from Screen 5, but later Screen 7 also. Today In 2017, the cinema closed for a major refurbishment at a cost of ¬£6.6m, reopening on 10 July 2017, with new finishes in all auditoria and public areas, and larger luxury auditorium seating installed with a commensurate reduction in seating capacity to a total of 1388. The architect was UNICK Architects, with the foyer, 1st floor bar area and new frontage details by Brinkworth Design, and auditoria largely fitted out by (or on behalf of) Eomac, the walls primarily being covered with stretched fabric over acoustic absorption and acoustic carpet. Proscenium details and tabs have been retained. Sony 4K projection is installed throughout, with dual Sony FINITY SRX-R515DS projectors, a product Sony markets for premium large format cinemas, in the two main auditoria, Screens 5 and 7; and Sony SRX-R320 projectors elsewhere. Screens 5-8 feature Harkness Clarus XC170 screens. The two main auditoria are also equipped for Dolby Atmos with a Dolby CP-850 processor, Dolby multi-channel amplifiers and Dolby SLS speakers. The facade has been updated with a new doors, and a new canopy, above which a single large (62.7m2) colour LED display has been installed. The ground floor foyer now features concessions for Square Pie, Pizzeria Malletti and Ben & Jerry's, as well as Vue's own counter, and two bars; one on the ground floor and another on the first floor.

He managed banks, dug canals, and was adopted as a chief into a tribe of the Seneca Indians.Edward Harold Mott Between the Ocean and the Lakes: The Story of Erie. Collins, 1899. p. 461-62 William Maxwell, Guy Maxwell's third son, was born at Tioga Point, now Athens, Pennsylvania, February 11, 1794. His parents moved that year to Newtown Point, now Elmira. He was educated in local schools, and studied law in the office of Fletcher Mathews, a distinguished member of the bar at that time. Chemung Canal Bank Building, chartered in July 1833.  District Attorney of Tioga County  In 1822 he was the District Attorney of Tioga County, of which Chemung County was then a part; in 1829 he was the surrogate of the county, and was a member of the Assembly in 1828 and in 1847. He was a delegate from the county to the State Constitutional Convention of 1846. He was always prominent in the public affairs of the town and county, and was connected with the formation of the Chemung Canal Bank, one of the earliest enterprises of the kind in the Southern Tier. At one time most of the land in the Third and Seventh Wards of the city of Elmira, and reaching beyond for two or three miles toward Horseheads, stood in his name. He was a power in the Democratic party in those times in that region, and what he said became the order of things. It was largely through his push and influence that the Chemung Canal was constructed, and his enterprise and money helped on most of the railroad enterprises in Elmira.  New York and Erie Railroad  He early became interested in the project of the New York and Erie Railroad, and was an influential delegate to several of the conventions held to adopt measures looking to the furthering of the prospects of that undertaking. Map of New York & Erie Rail Road constructions, 1844 It was the part he took at a convention held at Owego in the spring of 1842 that brought him into the prominence in Erie affairs that resulted in his being made president in the fall of that year.  Family  He married Zerwiah Baldwin, September 15, 1814, a daughter of William and Azubah Baldwin, pioneers of the Chemung Valley. One son was born to Mr. Maxwell, but died in infancy. They adopted as their daughter a niece of Mrs. Maxwell, Azubah McQuhae. Mr. Maxwell died at Maxwell Park, Elmira, November 22, 1856. An old-timer at Elmira Ausburn Towner, of Washington, D. C, to whom Edward Harold Mott declared himself indebted for his sketch pays this tribute to William Maxwell: > I remember him ever since I can remember anything. He lived in one of the > most beautiful spots in the valley, a big brick house, with a great lawn, > and lots of trees, that must have belonged to the original forest there.

The attacks occurred intermittently from June 2002 to March 2006, due to regional instability caused by the start of the War on Terrorism. The US consulate has been described as a tempting target for terrorism. June 2002 attack On the morning of June 14, 2002, a truck with a fertilizer bomb driven by a suicide bomber was detonated outside the United States Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan. Twelve people were killed and 51 injured, all Pakistanis. A group called al-Qanoon claimed responsibility for the attack. However, the incident is believed to have been connected with al-Qaeda and the US War on Terror although no conclusive links were proven. Several people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack, and were reported to be members of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, a large insurgent organisation. In November 2004, the alleged mastermind of the attack, Naveed-ul Hassan, was arrested in Pakistan. February 2003 shooting On February 28, 2003, gunmen killed two police officers and wounded five other officers and a civilian in front of the consulate. The attack was conducted from motorcycles, and was deliberately aimed at the paramilitary rangers who have taken over guard duties at the consulate from the Pakistani police. March 2004 bomb plot On March 15, 2004, there was another attempt to blow up a van in front of the consulate. A grey van was stolen the day before after the driver was shot in the leg. The same van with different plates was later found parked in front of the US Consulate at 7:15 am. When the driver of the parked van was questioned by the police, he claimed that the van had broken down. Soon after, the man was picked up by another car. The police investigated the van and discovered a large blue tank filled with nearly 200 gallons of liquid explosives hooked up to a timer and two detonators. The device was deactivated. March 2006 bombing On March 2, 2006, a suicide car bomb killed four people and injured thirty outside the Marriott Hotel in Karachi, which is about 20 yards from the consulate. Among the dead was David Foy, an American diplomat and three Pakistanis. It appears that Foy was the direct target of the bomber, who detonated his vehicle in the car park behind the consulate as Foy arrived. The bomb was reported to be the most powerful attack of its kind in Karachi, and it left a two-metre crater in the car park and destroyed at least ten nearby cars.

The disclosures have been largely instigated by revelations from the former American National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The Mira hotel in Hong Kong, where Edward Snowden hosted his first meeting with Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and journalist Ewen MacAskill of The Guardian 2012 In April 2012, Defense contractor Edward Snowden began downloading sensitive Western intelligence material while working for the American computer corporation Dell.Mark Hosenball (August 15, 2013), Snowden downloaded NSA secrets while working for Dell, sources say Reuters By the end of the year, Snowden had made his first contact with journalist Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian.Peter Maass (August 18, 2013), \\"How Laura Poitras Helped Snowden Spill His Secrets\\" The New York Times  January‚ÄìMay 2013 In January 2013, Snowden contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras. In March 2013, Snowden took up a new job at Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii, specifically to gain access to additional top-secret documents that could be leaked. In April 2013, Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New York City. In May 2013, Snowden was permitted temporary leave from his position at the NSA in Hawaii, on the pretext of receiving treatment for his epilepsy. Towards the end of May, Snowden flew to Hong Kong.  June 2013  After the U.S.-based editor of The Guardian held several meetings in New York City, it was decided that Greenwald, Poitras, and The Guardians defence and intelligence correspondent Ewen MacAskill would fly to Hong Kong to meet Snowden. On June 5, in the first media report based on the leaked material,Everything We Learned From Edward Snowden in 2013 - NationalJournal.com The Guardian exposed a top secret court order showing that the NSA had collected phone records from over 120 million Verizon subscribers. Under the order, the numbers of both parties on a call, as well as the location data, unique identifiers, time of call, and duration of call were handed over to the FBI, which turned over the records to the NSA. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Verizon order is part of a controversial data program, which seeks to stockpile records on all calls made in the U.S., but doesn't collect information directly from T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless, in part because of their foreign ownership ties. On June 7, 2013, the second media disclosure, the revelation of the PRISM surveillance program, was published simultaneously by The Guardian and The Washington Post. Documents provided by Snowden to Der Spiegel revealed how the NSA spied on various diplomatic missions of the European Union (EU) including the EU's delegation to the United States in Washington D.C., the EU's delegation to the United Nations in New York, and the Council of the European Union in Brussels, as well as the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

A method of bugging encrypted fax machines used at an EU embassy is codenamed Dropmire. During the 2009 G-20 London summit, the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intercepted the communications of foreign diplomats. In addition, the GCHQ has been intercepting and storing mass quantities of fiber-optic traffic via Tempora. Two principal components of Tempora are called \\"Mastering the Internet\\" (MTI) and \\"Global Telecoms Exploitation\\". The data is preserved for three days while metadata is kept for thirty days. Data collected by the GCHQ under Tempora is shared with the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. From 2001 to 2011, the NSA collected vast amounts of metadata records detailing the email and internet usage of Americans via Stellar Wind, which was later terminated due to operational and resource constraints. It was subsequently replaced by newer surveillance programs such as ShellTrumpet, which \\"processed its one trillionth metadata record\\" by the end of December 2012. According to the Boundless Informant, over 97 billion pieces of intelligence were collected over a 30-day period ending in March 2013. Out of all 97 billion sets of information, about 3 billion data sets originated from U.S. computer networks and around 500 million metadata records were collected from German networks. Several weeks later, it was revealed that the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) of Germany transfers massive amounts of metadata records to the NSA. On June 11, 2013, The Guardian published a snapshot of the NSA's global map of electronic data collection for the month of March 2013. Known as the Boundless Informant, the program is used by the NSA to track the amount of data being analyzed over a specific period of time. The color scheme ranges from green (least subjected to surveillance) through yellow and orange to red (most surveillance). Outside the Middle East, only China, Germany, India, Kenya, and the United States are colored orange or yellow  July 2013 According to the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, the NSA spied on millions of emails and calls of Brazilian citizens,EUA espionaram milh√µes de e-mails e liga√ß√µes de brasileiros, O Globo, July 6, 2013.

According to Edward Snowden, the NSA has established secret intelligence partnerships with many Western governments. The Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD) of the NSA is responsible for these partnerships, which, according to Snowden, are organized such that foreign governments can \\"insulate their political leaders\\" from public outrage in the event that these global surveillance partnerships are leaked. In an interview published by Der Spiegel, Snowden accused the NSA of being \\"in bed together with the Germans\\". The NSA granted the German intelligence agencies BND (foreign intelligence) and BfV (domestic intelligence) access to its controversial XKeyscore system.'Prolific Partner': German Intelligence Used NSA Spy Program, Der Spiegel. Retrieved July 21, 2013. In return, the BND turned over copies of two systems named Mira4 and Veras, reported to exceed the NSA's SIGINT capabilities in certain areas. Every day, massive amounts of metadata records are collected by the BND and transferred to the NSA via the Bad Aibling Station near Munich, Germany. In December 2012 alone, the BND handed over 500 million metadata records to the NSA. In a document dated January 2013, the NSA acknowledged the efforts of the BND to undermine privacy laws: According to an NSA document dated April 2013, Germany has now become the NSA's \\"most prolific partner\\". Under a section of a separate document leaked by Snowden titled \\"Success Stories\\", the NSA acknowledged the efforts of the German government to expand the BND's international data sharing with partners: In addition, the German government was well aware of the PRISM surveillance program long before Edward Snowden made details public. According to Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert, there are two separate PRISM programs - one is used by the NSA and the other is used by NATO forces in Afghanistan. Both surveillance programs are \\"not identical\\". The Guardian revealed further details of the NSA's XKeyscore tool, which allows government analysts to search through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals without prior authorization.Greenwald, Glenn (July 31, 2013).\\"XKeyscore: NSA tool collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'\\".

An internal NSA document dating from 3 August 2012 described the PRISM surveillance program as a \\"team sport\\". Even if there is no reason to suspect U.S. citizens of wrongdoing, the CIA's National Counterterrorism Center is allowed to examine federal government files for possible criminal behavior. Previously the NTC was barred to do so, unless a person was a terror suspect or related to an investigation. Snowden also confirmed that Stuxnet was cooperatively developed by the United States and Israel.

The following networks have been infiltrated by the GCHQ: TAT-14 (Europe-USA), Atlantic Crossing 1 (Europe-USA), Circe South (France-UK), Circe North (The Netherlands-UK), Flag Atlantic-1, Flag Europa-Asia, SEA-ME-WE 3 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe), SEA-ME-WE 4 (Southeast Asia-Middle East- Western Europe), Solas (Ireland-UK), UK-France 3, UK-Netherlands 14, ULYSSES (Europe-UK), Yellow (UK-USA) and Pan European Crossing. Telecommunication companies who participated were \\"forced\\" to do so and had \\"no choice in the matter\\". Some of the companies were subsequently paid by GCHQ for their participation in the infiltration of the cables. According to the SZ the GCHQ has access to the majority of internet and telephone communications flowing throughout Europe, can listen to phone calls, read emails and text messages, see which websites internet users from all around the world are visiting. It can also retain and analyse nearly the entire European internet traffic. The GCHQ is collecting all data transmitted to and from the United Kingdom and Northern Europe via the undersea fibre optic telecommunications cable SEA-ME- WE 3. The Security and Intelligence Division (SID) of Singapore co-operates with Australia in accessing and sharing communications carried by the SEA-ME- WE-3 cable. The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) is also in a partnership with British, American and Singaporean intelligence agencies to tap undersea fibre optic telecommunications cables that link Asia, the Middle East and Europe and carry much of Australia's international phone and internet traffic. The U.S. runs a top-secret surveillance program known as the Special Collection Service (SCS), which is based in over 80 U.S. consulates and embassies worldwide. The NSA hacked the United Nations' video conferencing system in Summer 2012 in violation of a UN agreement. The NSA is not just intercepting the communications of Americans who are in direct contact with foreigners targeted overseas, but also searching the contents of vast amounts of e-mail and text communications into and out of the country by Americans who mention information about foreigners under surveillance. It also spied on the Al Jazeera and gained access to its internal communications systems. The NSA has built a surveillance network that has the capacity to reach roughly 75% of all U.S. Internet traffic. U.S. Law-enforcement agencies use tools used by computer hackers to gather information on suspects. An internal NSA audit from May 2012 identified 2776 incidents i.e. violations of the rules or court orders for surveillance of Americans and foreign targets in the U.S. in the period from April 2011 through March 2012, while U.S. officials stressed that any mistakes are not intentional. The FISA Court that is supposed to provide critical oversight of the U.S. government's vast spying programs has limited ability to do and it must trust the government to report when it improperly spies on Americans. A legal opinion declassified on August 21, 2013 revealed that the NSA intercepted for three years as many as 56,000 electronic communications a year of Americans who weren't suspected of having links to terrorism, before FISC court that oversees surveillance found the operation unconstitutional in 2011. Under the Corporate Partner Access project, major U.S. telecommunications providers receive hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the NSA. Voluntary cooperation between the NSA and the providers of global communications took off during the 1970s under the cover name BLARNEY. A letter drafted by the Obama administration specifically to inform Congress of the government's mass collection of Americans‚Äô telephone communications data was withheld from lawmakers by leaders of the House Intelligence Committee in the months before a key vote affecting the future of the program. The NSA paid GCHQ over ¬£100 Million between 2009 and 2012, in exchange for these funds GCHQ \\"must pull its weight and be seen to pull its weight.\\" Documents referenced in the article explain that the weaker British laws regarding spying are \\"a selling point\\" for the NSA. GCHQ is also developing the technology to \\"exploit any mobile phone at any time.\\" The NSA has under a legal authority a secret backdoor into its databases gathered from large Internet companies enabling it to search for U.S. citizens' email and phone calls without a warrant. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board urged the U.S. intelligence chiefs to draft stronger US surveillance guidelines on domestic spying after finding that several of those guidelines have not been updated up to 30 years. U.S. intelligence analysts have deliberately broken rules designed to prevent them from spying on Americans by choosing to ignore so-called \\"minimisation procedures\\" aimed at protecting privacy. After the U.S. Foreign Secret Intelligence Court ruled in October 2011 that some of the NSA's activities were unconstitutional, the agency paid millions of dollars to major internet companies to cover extra costs incurred in their involvement with the PRISM surveillance program. \\"Mastering the Internet\\" (MTI) is part of the Interception Modernisation Programme (IMP) of the British government that involves the insertion of thousands of DPI (deep packet inspection) \\"black boxes\\" at various internet service providers, as revealed by the British media in 2009. In 2013, it was further revealed that the NSA had made a ¬£17.2 million financial contribution to the project, which is capable of vacuuming signals from up to 200 fibre-optic cables at all physical points of entry into Great Britain.  September 2013 The Guardian and The New York Times reported on secret documents leaked by Snowden showing that the NSA has been in \\"collaboration with technology companies\\" as part of \\"an aggressive, multipronged effort\\" to weaken the encryption used in commercial software, and the GCHQ has a team dedicated to cracking \\"Hotmail, Google, Yahoo and Facebook\\" traffic. Israel, Sweden and Italy are also cooperating with American and British intelligence agencies. Under a secret treaty codenamed \\"Lustre\\", French intelligence agencies transferred millions of metadata records to the NSA. The Obama Administration secretly won permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 to reverse restrictions on the National Security Agency's use of intercepted phone calls and e-mails, permitting the agency to search deliberately for Americans‚Äô communications in its massive databases. The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner ‚Äúreasonably believed‚Äù to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or ‚Äúforeign powers.‚Äù The FISC extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress. A special branch of the NSA called \\"Follow the Money\\" (FTM) monitors international payments, banking and credit card transactions and later stores the collected data in the NSA's own financial databank \\"Tracfin\\". The NSA monitored the communications of Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff and her top aides. The agency also spied on Brazil's oil firm Petrobras as well as French diplomats, and gained access to the private network of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France and the SWIFT network. In the United States, the NSA uses the analysis of phone call and e-mail logs of American citizens to create sophisticated graphs of their social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information. The NSA routinely shares raw intelligence data with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about U.S. citizens. In an effort codenamed GENIE, computer specialists can control foreign computer networks using \\"covert implants,‚Äù a form of remotely transmitted malware on tens of thousands of devices annually. As worldwide sales of smartphones began exceeding those of feature phones, the NSA decided to take advantage of the smartphone boom. This is particularly advantageous because the smartphone combines a myriad of data that would interest an intelligence agency, such as social contacts, user behavior, interests, location, photos and credit card numbers and passwords. An internal NSA report from 2010 stated that the spread of the smartphone has been occurring \\"extremely rapidly\\"‚Äîdevelopments that \\"certainly complicate traditional target analysis.\\" According to the document, the NSA has set up task forces assigned to several smartphone manufacturers and operating systems, including Apple Inc.'s iPhone and iOS operating system, as well as Google's Android mobile operating system. Similarly, Britain's GCHQ assigned a team to study and crack the BlackBerry. Under the heading \\"iPhone capability\\", the document notes that there are smaller NSA programs, known as \\"scripts\\", that can perform surveillance on 38 different features of the iOS 3 and iOS 4 operating systems. These include the mapping feature, voicemail and photos, as well as Google Earth, Facebook and Yahoo! Messenger.  October 2013  On October 4, 2013, The Washington Post and The Guardian jointly reported that the NSA and the GCHQ have made repeated attempts to spy on anonymous Internet users who have been communicating in secret via the anonymity network Tor. Several of these surveillance operations involve the implantation of malicious code into the computers of Tor users who visit particular websites. The NSA and GCHQ have partly succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. The government agencies were also able to uncover the identity of some anonymous Internet users. The Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) has been using a program called Olympia to map the communications of Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry by targeting the metadata of phone calls and emails to and from the ministry. The Australian Federal Government knew about the PRISM surveillance program months before Edward Snowden made details public. The NSA monitored the public email account of former Mexican president Felipe Calder√≥n (thus gaining access to the communications of high-ranking cabinet members), the E-Mails of several high-ranking members of Mexico's security forces and text and the mobile phone communication of current Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. The NSA tries to gather cellular and landline phone numbers‚Äîoften obtained from American diplomats‚Äîfor as many foreign officials as possible. The contents of the phone calls are stored in computer databases that can regularly be searched using keywords. The NSA has been monitoring telephone conversations of 35 world leaders. The U.S. government's first public acknowledgment that it tapped the phones of world leaders was reported on October 28, 2013 by the Wall Street Journal after an internal U.S. government review turned up NSA monitoring of some 35 world leaders. The GCHQ has tried to keep its mass surveillance program a secret because it feared a \\"damaging public debate\\" on the scale of its activities which could lead to legal challenges against them. The Guardian revealed that the NSA had been monitoring telephone conversations of 35 world leaders after being given the numbers by an official in another U.S. government department. A confidential memo revealed that the NSA encouraged senior officials in such Departments as the White House, State and The Pentagon, to share their \\"Rolodexes\\" so the agency could add the telephone numbers of leading foreign politicians to their surveillance systems. Reacting to the news, German leader Angela Merkel, arriving in Brussels for an EU summit, accused the U.S. of a breach of trust, saying: \\"We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this must now be established once again. I repeat that spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany.\\" The NSA collected in 2010 data on ordinary Americans‚Äô cellphone locations, but later discontinued it because it had no ‚Äúoperational value.‚Äù Under Britain's MUSCULAR programme, the NSA and the GCHQ have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centers around the world and thereby gained the ability to collect metadata and content at will from hundreds of millions of user accounts. The mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel might have been tapped by U.S. intelligence. According to the Spiegel this monitoring goes back to 2002 and ended in the summer of 2013, while the New York Times reported that Germany has evidence that the NSA's surveillance of Merkel began during George W. Bush's tenure. After learning from Der Spiegel magazine that the NSA has been listening in to her personal mobile phone, Merkel compared the snooping practices of the NSA with those of the Stasi. On October 31, 2013, Hans-Christian Str√∂bele, a member of the German Bundestag, met Snowden in Moscow and revealed the former intelligence contractor's readiness to brief the German government on NSA spying. A highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as Stateroom involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the Five Eyes (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called \\"Special Collection Service\\" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered. The SCS for example used the American Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to monitor communications in Germany's government district with its parliament and the seat of the government. Under the Stateroom surveillance programme, Australia operates clandestine surveillance facilities to intercept phone calls and data across much of Asia. In France, the NSA targeted people belonging to the worlds of business, politics or French state administration. The NSA monitored and recorded the content of telephone communications and the history of the connections of each target i.e. the metadata. The actual surveillance operation was performed by French intelligence agencies on behalf of the NSA. The cooperation between France and the NSA was confirmed by the Director of the NSA, Keith B. Alexander, who asserted that foreign intelligence services collected phone records in \\"war zones\\" and \\"other areas outside their borders\\" and provided them to the NSA. The French newspaper Le Monde also disclosed new PRISM and Upstream slides (See Page 4, 7 and 8) coming from the \\"PRISM/US-984XN Overview\\" presentation. In Spain, the NSA intercepted the telephone conversations, text messages and emails of millions of Spaniards, and spied on members of the Spanish government. Between December 10, 2012 and January 8, 2013, the NSA collected metadata on 60 million telephone calls in Spain. According to documents leaked by Snowden, the surveillance of Spanish citizens was jointly conducted by the NSA and the intelligence agencies of Spain. thumbcenter500pxOn October 4, 2013, The Washington Post published a powerpoint presentation leaked by Snowden, showing how the NSA has compromised the Tor encrypted network that is being employed by hundreds of thousands of people to circumvent \\"nation state internet policies\\". By secretly exploiting a JavaScript plug-in, the NSA is able to uncover the identities of various anonymous Internet users such as dissidents, terrorists, and other targets  November 2013  The New York Times reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. During his 2009 visit to Iranian Kurdistan, the agency collaborated with the GCHQ and the U.S.'s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is \\"communications fingerprinting\\": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in Iran. The same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of \\"an adversary\\". The ally was conducting a spear- phishing attack: its e-mails contained malware. The NSA gathered documents and login credentials belonging to the enemy country, along with knowledge of the ally's capabilities for attacking computers. According to the British newspaper The Independent, the British intelligence agency GCHQ maintains a listening post on the roof of the British Embassy in Berlin that is capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications all over the German capital, including adjacent government buildings such as the Reichstag (seat of the German parliament) and the Chancellery (seat of Germany's head of government) clustered around the Brandenburg Gate. Operating under the code-name \\"Quantum Insert\\", the GCHQ set up a fake website masquerading as LinkedIn, a social website used for professional networking, as part of its efforts to install surveillance software on the computers of the telecommunications operator Belgacom. In addition, the headquarters of the oil cartel OPEC were infiltrated by the GCHQ as well as the NSA, which bugged the computers of nine OPEC employees and monitored the General Secretary of OPEC. For more than three years the GCHQ has been using an automated monitoring system code-named \\"Royal Concierge\\" to infiltrate the reservation systems of at least 350 upscale hotels in many different parts of the world in order to target, search and analyze reservations to detect diplomats and government officials. First tested in 2010, the aim of the \\"Royal Concierge\\" is to track down the travel plans of diplomats, and it is often supplemented with surveillance methods related to human intelligence (HUMINT). Other covert operations include the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels as well as the monitoring of computers hooked up to the hotel network. In November 2013, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Guardian revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate (DSD) had attempted to listen to the private phone calls of the president of Indonesia and his wife. The Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, confirmed that he and the president had contacted the ambassador in Canberra. Natalegawa said any tapping of Indonesian politicians‚Äô personal phones ‚Äúviolates every single decent and legal instrument I can think of‚Äînational in Indonesia, national in Australia, international as well‚Äù.Indonesia recalls Canberra ambassador over Yudhoyono phone tapping attempt, Foreign minister demands explanation after documents reveal Australian agencies targeted phones of president and his wife The Guardian 18 November 2013 Other high-ranking Indonesian politicians targeted by the DSD include: * Boediono (Vice President) * Jusuf Kalla (Former Vice President) * Dino Patti Djalal (Ambassador to the United States) * Andi Mallarangeng (Government spokesperson) * Hatta Rajasa (State Secretary) * Sri Mulyani Indrawati (Former Finance Minister and current managing director of the World Bank) * Widodo Adi Sutjipto (Former Commander-in-Chief of the military) * Sofyan Djalil (Senior government advisor) Carrying the title \\"3G impact and update\\", a classified presentation leaked by Snowden revealed the attempts of the ASD/DSD to keep up to pace with the rollout of 3G technology in Indonesia and across Southeast Asia. The ASD/DSD motto placed at the bottom of each page reads: \\"Reveal their secrets‚Äîprotect our own.\\" Under a secret deal approved by British intelligence officials, the NSA has been storing and analyzing the internet and email records of UK citizens since 2007. The NSA also proposed in 2005 a procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other Five-Eyes nations alliance, even where the partner government has explicitly denied the U.S. permission to do so. Under the proposal, partner countries must neither be informed about this particular type of surveillance, nor the procedure of doing so. Towards the end of November, The New York Times released an internal NSA report outlining the agency's efforts to expand its surveillance abilities. The five-page document asserts that the law of the United States has not kept up with the needs of the NSA to conduct mass surveillance in the \\"golden age\\" of signals intelligence, but there are grounds for optimism because, in the NSA's own words: The report, titled \\"SIGNT Strategy 2012‚Äì2016\\", also said that the U.S. will try to influence the \\"global commercial encryption market\\" through \\"commercial relationships\\", and emphasized the need to \\"revolutionize\\" the analysis of its vast data collection to \\"radically increase operational impact\\". On November 23, 2013, the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported that the Netherlands was targeted by U.S. intelligence agencies in the immediate aftermath of World War II. This period of surveillance lasted from 1946 to 1968, and also included the interception of the communications of other European countries including Belgium, France, West Germany and Norway. The Dutch Newspaper also reported that NSA infected more than 50,000 computer networks worldwide, often covertly, with malicious spy software, sometimes in cooperation with local authorities, designed to steal sensitive information. thumb700pxcenterOn November 23, 2013, the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad released a top secret NSA presentation leaked by Snowden, showing five \\"Classes of Accesses\\" that the NSA uses in its worldwide signals intelligence operations. These five \\"Classes of Accesses\\" are:  December 2013 According to the classified documents leaked by Snowden, the Australian Signals Directorate, formerly known as the Defence Signals Directorate, had offered to share information on Australian citizens with the other intelligence agencies of the UKUSA Agreement. Data shared with foreign countries include \\"bulk, unselected, unminimised metadata\\" such as \\"medical, legal or religious information\\". The Washington Post revealed that the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than five billion records of phone locations on a daily basis. This enables NSA analysts to map cellphone owners‚Äô relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths. The Washington Post also reported that the NSA makes use of location data and advertising tracking files generated through normal internet browsing i.e. tools that enable Internet advertisers to track consumers from Google and others to get information on potential targets, to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance. The Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), which cooperates with the NSA, has gained access to Russian targets in the Kola Peninsula and other civilian targets. In general, the NIS provides information to the NSA about \\"Politicians\\", \\"Energy\\" and \\"Armament\\". A top secret memo of the NSA lists the following years as milestones of the Norway-United States of America SIGNT agreement, or NORUS Agreement: * 1952 - Informal starting year of cooperation between the NIS and the NSA * 1954 - Formalization of the agreement * 1963 - Extension of the agreement for coverage of foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT) * 1970 - Extension of the agreement for coverage of electronic intelligence (ELINT) * 1994 - Extension of the agreement for coverage of communications intelligence (COMINT) The NSA considers the NIS to be one of its most reliable partners. Both agencies also cooperate to crack the encryption systems of mutual targets. According to the NSA, Norway has made no objections to its requests from the NIS. On 5 December, Sveriges Television reported that the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) has been conducting a clandestine surveillance operation in Sweden, targeting the internal politics of Russia. The operation was conducted on behalf of the NSA, receiving data handed over to it by the FRA. The Swedish-American surveillance operation also targeted Russian energy interests as well as the Baltic states. As part of the UKUSA Agreement, a secret treaty was signed in 1954 by Sweden with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, regarding collaboration and intelligence sharing. As a result of Snowden's disclosures, the notion of Swedish neutrality in international politics was called into question. In an internal document dating from the year 2006, the NSA acknowledged that its \\"relationship\\" with Sweden is \\"protected at the TOP SECRET level because of that nation‚Äôs political neutrality.\\" Specific details of Sweden's cooperation with members of the UKUSA Agreement include: * The FRA has been granted access to XKeyscore, an analytical database of the NSA. * Sweden updated the NSA on changes in Swedish legislation that provided the legal framework for information sharing between the FRA and the Swedish Security Service. * Since January 2013, a counterterrorism analyst of the NSA has been stationed in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. * The NSA, the GCHQ and the FRA signed an agreement in 2004 that allows the FRA to directly collaborate with the NSA without having to consult the GCHQ. In order to identify targets for government hacking and surveillance, both the GCHQ and the NSA have used advertising cookies operated by Google, known as Pref, to \\"pinpoint\\" targets. According to documents leaked by Snowden, the Special Source Operations of the NSA has been sharing information containing \\"logins, cookies, and GooglePREFID\\" with the Tailored Access Operations division of the NSA, as well as Britain's GCHQ agency. During the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit, the U.S. embassy in Ottawa was transformed into a security command post during a six-day spying operation that was conducted by the NSA and closely co- ordinated with the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC). The goal of the spying operation was, among others, to obtain information on international development, banking reform, and to counter trade protectionism to support \\"U.S. policy goals.\\" On behalf of the NSA, the CSEC has set up covert spying posts in 20 countries around the world. In Italy the Special Collection Service of the NSA maintains two separate surveillance posts in Rome and Milan. According to a secret NSA memo dated September 2010, the Italian embassy in Washington, D.C. has been targeted by two spy operations of the NSA: * Under the codename \\"Bruneau\\", which refers to mission \\"Lifesaver\\", the NSA sucks out all the information stored in the embassy's computers and creates electronic images of hard disk drives. * Under the codename \\"Hemlock\\", which refers to mission \\"Highlands\\", the NSA gains access to the embassy's communications through physical \\"implants\\". Due to concerns that terrorist or criminal networks may be secretly communicating via computer games, the NSA, the GCHQ, the CIA, and the FBI have been conducting surveillance and scooping up data from the networks of many online games, including massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) such as World of Warcraft, as well as virtual worlds such as Second Life, and the Xbox gaming console. The NSA has cracked the most commonly used cellphone encryption technology, A5/1. According to a classified document leaked by Snowden, the agency can \\"process encrypted A5/1\\" even when it has not acquired an encryption key. In addition, the NSA uses various types of cellphone infrastructure, such as the links between carrier networks, to determine the location of a cellphone user tracked by Visitor Location Registers. US district court judge for the District of Columbia, Richard Leon, declared on December 16, 2013, that the mass collection of metadata of Americans‚Äô telephone records by the National Security Agency probably violates the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. Leon granted the request for a preliminary injunction that blocks the collection of phone data for two private plaintiffs (Larry Klayman, a conservative lawyer, and Charles Strange, father of a cryptologist killed in Afghanistan when his helicopter was shot down in 2011) and ordered the government to destroy any of their records that have been gathered. But the judge stayed action on his ruling pending a government appeal, recognizing in his 68-page opinion the ‚Äúsignificant national security interests at stake in this case and the novelty of the constitutional issues.‚Äù However federal judge William H. Pauley III in New York City ruled the U.S. government's global telephone data-gathering system is needed to thwart potential terrorist attacks, and that it can only work if everyone's calls are swept in. U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is Smith v. Maryland: ‚ÄúSmith‚Äôs bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties,‚Äù Judge Pauley wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union declared on January 2, 2012 that it will appeal Judge Pauley's ruling that NSA bulk the phone record collection is legal. \\"The government has a legitimate interest in tracking the associations of suspected terrorists, but tracking those associations does not require the government to subject every citizen to permanent surveillance,‚Äù deputy ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement. In recent years, American and British intelligence agencies conducted surveillance on more than 1,100 targets, including the office of an Israeli prime minister, heads of international aid organizations, foreign energy companies and a European Union official involved in antitrust battles with American technology businesses. A catalog of high- tech gadgets and software developed by the NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) was leaked by the German news magazine Der Spiegel. Dating from 2008, the catalog revealed the existence of special gadgets modified to capture computer screenshots and USB flash drives secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves, and fake base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals, as well as many other secret devices and software implants listed here: File:NSA SPARROW II.jpgSPARROW II - Mobile device that functions as a WLAN collection system File:NSA FIREWALK.jpgFIREWALK - Hardware implant for collection of Gigabit Ethernet network traffic File:NSA GINSU.jpgGINSU - Software that extends application persistence for the CNE (Computer Network Exploitation) implant KONGUR File:NSA IRATEMONK.jpgIRATEMONK - Replaces master boot records (MBRs) of various hard disk manufacturers File:NSA SWAP.jpgSWAP - Exploits motherboard BIOS before the operating system loads File:NSA WISTFULTOLL.jpgWISTFULTOLL - Software implant that exploits Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to transfer data File:NSA HOWLERMONKEY.jpgHOWLERMONKEY - Short to medium range radio frequency (RF) transceiver File:NSA NIGHTSTAND.jpgNIGHTSTAND - Mobile device that introduces NSA software to computers up to 8 miles (13 kilometers) away via Wireless LAN File:NSA COTTONMOUTH-I.jpgCOTTONMOUTH-I - USB flash drive implant File:NSA COTTONMOUTH-II.jpgCOTTONMOUTH-II - USB implant File:NSA COTTONMOUTH- III.jpgCOTTONMOUTH-III - USB implant File:NSA JUNIORMINT.jpgJUNIORMINT - Digital core packaged into a printed circuit board (PCB) and a flip chip File:NSA MAESTRO-II.jpgMAESTRO-II - Miniaturized digital core packaged into a multi-chip module (MCM) File:NSA TRINITY.jpgTRINITY - Miniaturized digital core packaged into a multi-chip module (MCM) File:NSA SOMBERKNAVE.jpgSOMBERKNAVE - Software implant for Windows XP that provides covert Internet access for the NSA's targets File:NSA SURLYSPAWN.jpgSURLYSPAWN - Device for keystroke logging NSA RAGEMASTER.jpgRAGEMASTER - Hardware implant concealed in a computer's Video Graphics Array (VGA) to capture screenshots and video File:NSA IRONCHEF.jpgIRONCHEF - Software implant that functions as a permanent BIOS system File:NSA_DEITYBOUNCE.jpgDEITYBOUNCE - Software implant for insertion into Dell PowerEdge servers File:NSA JETPLOW.jpgJETPLOW - Installs a backdoor targeting Cisco PIX and ASA firewalls File:NSA HALLUXWATER.jpgHALLUXWATER - Installs a backdoor targeting Huawei's Eudemon firewalls File:NSA FEEDTROUGH.jpgFEEDTROUGH - Installs a backdoor targeting numerous Juniper Networks firewalls File:NSA GOURMETTROUGH.jpgGOURMETTROUGH - Installs a backdoor targeting numerous Juniper Networks firewalls File:NSA SOUFFLETROUGH.jpgSOUFFLETROUGH - BIOS implant for Juniper SSG300 and SSG 500 series firewalls File:NSA LOUDAUTO.jpgLOUDAUTO - Covert listening device File:NSA NIGHTWATCH.jpgNIGHTWATCH - Device for reconstruction of signals belonging to target systems File:NSA CTX4000.jpgCTX4000 - Portable continuous-wave radar (CRW) unit to illuminate a target system for Dropmire collection File:NSA PHOTOANGLO.jpgPHOTOANGLO - Successor to the CTX4000, jointly developed by the NSA and the GCHQ File:NSA TAWDRYYARD.jpgTAWDRYYARD - Device that functions as a radio frequency (RF) retroreflector File:NSA PICASSO.jpgPICASSO - Modified GSM handset File:Nsa-ant-genesis.jpgGENESIS - Modified Motorola SLVR L9 handset File:NSA CROSSBEAM.jpgCROSSBEAM - GSM module for commercial mobile phones File:NSA CANDYGRAM.jpgCANDYGRAM - Mimics the GMS cell tower of targeted networks File:NSA DROPOUTJEEP.jpgDROPOUTJEEP - Software implant for the iOS operating system of the iPhone File:NSA GOPHERSET.jpgGOPHERSET - Software implant for GSM subscriber identity module (SIM) cards that pulls out address books, SMS (Short Message Service) text messages, and call log information File:NSA MONKEYCALENDAR.jpgMONKEYCALENDAR - Software implant for GSM subscriber identity module (SIM) cards that pulls out geolocation information File:NSA TOTECHASER.jpgTOTECHASER - Windows CE implant that targets the Thuraya handset File:NSA TOTEGHOSTLY.jpgTOTEGHOSTLY 2.0 - Software implant for Windows Mobile capable of retrieving SMS (Short Message Service) text messages, Voicemail and contact lists, as well as turning on built-in microphones and cameras The Tailored Access Operations (TAO) division of the NSA intercepted the shipping deliveries of computers and laptops in order to install spyware and physical implants on electronic gadgets. This was done in close cooperation with the FBI and the CIA. NSA officials responded to the Spiegel reports with a statement, which said: \\"Tailored Access Operations is a unique national asset that is on the front lines of enabling NSA to defend the nation and its allies. [TAO's] work is centred on computer network exploitation in support of foreign intelligence collection.\\" In a separate disclosure unrelated to Snowden, the French Tr√©sor public, which runs a certificate authority, was found to have issued fake certificates impersonating Google in order to facilitate spying on French government employees via man-in-the-middle attacks.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/10/french_gov_dodgy_ssl_cert_reprimand/ January 2014 The NSA is working to build a powerful quantum computer capable of breaking all types of encryption. The effort is part of a US$79.7 million research program known as \\"Penetrating Hard Targets\\". It involves extensive research carried out in large, shielded rooms known as Faraday cages, which are designed to prevent electromagnetic radiation from entering or leaving. Currently, the NSA is close to producing basic building blocks that will allow the agency to gain \\"complete quantum control on two semiconductor qubits\\". Once a quantum computer is successfully built, it would enable the NSA to unlock the encryption that protects data held by banks, credit card companies, retailers, brokerages, governments and health care providers. According to the New York Times the NSA is monitoring approximately 100.000 computers worldwide with spy software named Quantum. Quantum enables the NSA to conduct surveillance on those computers on the one hand and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks on the other hand. Among the targets are the Chinese and Russian military, but also trade institutions within the European Union. The NYT also reported that the NSA can access and alter computers which are not connected with the internet by a secret technology in use by the NSA since 2008. The prerequisite is the physically insertion of the radio frequency hardware by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user. The technology relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The technology can also transmit malware back to the infected computer. Channel 4 and The Guardian revealed the existence of Dishfire, a massive database of the NSA that collects hundreds of millions of text messages on a daily basis. The GCHQ has been given full access to the database, which it uses to obtain personal information of Britons by exploiting a legal loophole. Each day, the database receives and stores the following amounts of data: * Geolocation data of more than 76,000 text messages and other travel information * Over 110,000 names, gathered from electronic business cards * Over 800,000 financial transactions that are either gathered from text-to-text payments or by linking credit cards to phone users * Details of 1.6 million border crossings based on the interception of network roaming alerts * Over 5 million missed call alerts * About 200 million text messages from around the world The database is supplemented with an analytical tool known as the Prefer program, which processes SMS messages to extract other types of information including contacts from missed call alerts. According to a joint disclosure by the New York Times, the Guardian, and ProPublica, the NSA and the GCHQ have begun working together to collect and store data from dozens of smartphone application software by 2007 at the latest. A 2008 GCHQ report leaked by Snowden asserts that \\"anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system\\". The NSA and the GCHQ have traded recipes for various purposes such as grabbing location data and journey plans that are made when a target uses Google Maps, and vacuuming up address books, buddy lists, phone logs and geographic data embedded in photos posted on the mobile versions of numerous social networks such as Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn, Twitter and other services. In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, the GCHQ cited the popular smarphone game \\"Angry Birds\\" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through geolocation), age, gender, ZIP code, marital status, income, ethnicity, sexual orientation, education level, number of children, etc. A GCHQ document dated August 2012 provided details of the Squeaky Dolphin surveillance program, which enables the GCHQ to conduct broad, real-time monitoring of various social media features and social media traffic such as YouTube video views, the Like button on Facebook, and Blogspot/Blogger visits without the knowledge or consent of the companies providing those social media features. The agency's ‚ÄúSqueaky Dolphin‚Äù program can collect, analyze and utilize YouTube, Facebook and Blogger data in specific situations in real time for analysis purposes. The program also collects the addresses from the billion of videos watched daily as well as some user information for analysis purposes. During the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, the NSA and its Five Eyes partners monitored the communications of delegates of numerous countries. This was done to give their own policymakers a negotiating advantage. The Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) has been tracking Canadian air passengers via free Wi-Fi services at a major Canadian airport. Passengers who exited the airport terminal continued to be tracked as they showed up at other Wi-Fi locations across Canada. In a CSEC document dated May 2012, the agency described how it had gained access to two communications systems with over 300,000 users in order to pinpoint a specific imaginary target. The operation was executed on behalf of the NSA as a trial run to test a new technology capable of tracking down \\"any target that makes occasional forays into other cities/regions.\\" This technology was subsequently shared with Canada's Five Eyes partners - Australia, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States. February 2014 According to research by S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and TV network NDR the mobile phone of former German chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to military intervention in Iraq. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the National Sigint Requirement List (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to Angela Merkel's mobile. However S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post ‚Äì which in 2002 was still held by Schr√∂der. According to research by the two media outlets, Schr√∂der was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA. The GCHQ launched a cyber-attack on the activist network \\"Anonymous\\", using denial-of-service attack (DoS) to shut down a chatroom frequented by the network's members and to spy on them. The attack, dubbed Rolling Thunder, was conducted by a GCHQ unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG). The unit successfully uncovered the true identities of several Anonymous members. The NSA Section 215 bulk telephony metadata program which seeks to stockpile records on all calls made in the U.S. is collecting less than 30 percent of all Americans‚Äô call records because of an inability to keep pace with the explosion in cellphone use according to the Washington Post.. The controversial program permits the NSA after a warrant granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to record numbers, length and location of every call from the participating carriers in.  March 2014  The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed TURBINE which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by The Intercept, TURBINE is designed to \\"allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually.\\" The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance ‚Äì the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of: * breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks * infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive * covertly recording audio from a computer's microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam * launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites * exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance \\"sensors\\" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or \\"tips\\" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data \\"selectors\\" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique \\"cookies\\" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates. The CIA was accused by U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein of spying on a stand-alone computer network established for the committee in its investigation of allegations of CIA abuse in a George W. Bush-era detention and interrogation program. A voice interception program codenamed MYSTIC began in 2009. Along with RETRO, short for \\"retrospective retrieval\\" (RETRO is voice audio recording buffer that allows retrieval of captured content up to 30 days into the past), the MYSTIC program is capable of recording \\"100 percent\\" of a foreign country's telephone calls, enabling the NSA to rewind and review conversations up to 30 days and the relating metadata. With the capability to store up to 30 days of recorded conversations MYSTIC enables the NSA to pull an instant history of the person's movements, associates and plans. On March 21, Le Monde published slides from an internal presentation of the Communications Security Establishment Canada, which attributed a piece of malicious software to French intelligence. The CSEC presentation concluded that the list of malware victims matched French intelligence priorities and found French cultural reference in the malware's code, including the name Babar, a popular French children's character, and the developer name \\"Titi\\". The French telecommunications corporation Orange S.A. shares its call data with the French intelligence agency DGSE, which hands over the intercepted data to GCHQ. The NSA has spied on the Chinese technology company Huawei. Huawei is a leading manufacturer of smartphones, tablets, mobile phone infrastructure, and WLAN routers and installs fiber optic cable. According to Der Spiegel this \\"kind of technology [‚Ä¶] is decisive in the NSA's battle for data supremacy.\\" The NSA, in an operation named \\"Shotgiant\\", was able to access Huawei's email archive and the source code for Huawei's communications products. The US government has had longstanding concerns that Huawei may not be independent of the People's Liberation Army and that the Chinese government might use equipment manufactured by Huawei to conduct cyberespionage or cyberwarfare. The goals of the NSA operation were to assess the relationship between Huawei and the PLA, to learn more the Chinese government's plans and to use information from Huawei to spy on Huawei's customers, including Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kenya, and Cuba. Former Chinese President Hu Jintao, the Chinese Trade Ministry, banks, as well as telecommunications companies were also targeted by the NSA. The Intercept published a document of an NSA employee discussing how to build a database of IP addresses, webmail, and Facebook accounts associated with system administrators so that the NSA can gain access to the networks and systems they administer. At the end of March 2014, Der Spiegel and The Intercept published, based on a series of classified files from the archive provided to reporters by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, articles related to espionage efforts by GCHQ and NSA in Germany. The British GCHQ targeted three German internet firms for information about Internet traffic passing through internet exchange points, important customers of the German internet providers, their technology suppliers as well as future technical trends in their business sector and company employees. The NSA was granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the authority for blanket surveillance of Germany, its people and institutions, regardless whether those affected are suspected of having committed an offense or not, without an individualized court order specifying on March 7, 2013. In addition Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel was listed in a surveillance search machine and database named Nymrod along with 121 others foreign leaders. As The Intercept wrote: \\"The NSA uses the Nymrod system to 'find information relating to targets that would otherwise be tough to track down,' according to internal NSA documents. Nymrod sifts through secret reports based on intercepted communications as well as full transcripts of faxes, phone calls, and communications collected from computer systems. More than 300 'cites' for Merkel are listed as available in intelligence reports and transcripts for NSA operatives to read.\\"  April 2014  Towards the end of April, Edward Snowden said that the United States surveillance agencies spy on Americans more than anyone else in the world, contrary to anything that has been said by the government up until this point.  May 2014  An article published by Ars Technica shows NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) employees intercepting a Cisco router. The Intercept and WikiLeaks revealed information about which countries were having their communications collected as part of the MYSTIC surveillance program. On May 19, The Intercept reported that the NSA is recording and archiving nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas with a system called SOMALGET, a subprogram of MYSTIC. The mass surveillance has been occurring without the Bahamian government's permission. Aside from the Bahamas, The Intercept reported NSA interception of cell phone metadata in Kenya, the Philippines, Mexico and a fifth country it did not name due to \\"credible concerns that doing so could lead to increased violence.\\" WikiLeaks released a statement on May 23 claiming that Afghanistan was the unnamed nation. In a statement responding to the revelations, the NSA said \\"the implication that NSA's foreign intelligence collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false.\\" Through its global surveillance operations the NSA exploits the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications to harvest millions of images. These images are then used by the NSA in sophisticated facial recognition programs to track suspected terrorists and other intelligence targets.  June 2014  Vodafone revealed that there were secret wires that allowed government agencies direct access to their networks. This access does not require warrants and the direct access wire is often equipment in a locked room. In six countries where Vodafone operates, the law requires telecommunication companies to install such access or allows governments to do so. Vodafone did not name these countries in case some governments retaliated by imprisoning their staff. Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty said \\"For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying. Snowden revealed the internet was already treated as fair game. Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin ‚Äì our analogue laws need a digital overhaul.\\" Vodafone published its first Law Enforcement Disclosure Report on June 6, 2014. Vodafone group privacy officer Stephen Deadman said \\"These pipes exist, the direct access model exists. We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data. Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility. If we receive a demand we can push back against the agency. The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used.\\" Gus Hosein, director of Privacy International said \\"I never thought the telcos would be so complicit. It's a brave step by Vodafone and hopefully the other telcos will become more brave with disclosure, but what we need is for them to be braver about fighting back against the illegal requests and the laws themselves.\\" Above-top-secret documentation of a covert surveillance program named Overseas Processing Centre 1 (OPC-1) (codenamed \\"CIRCUIT\\") by GCHQ was published by The Register. Based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, GCHQ taps into undersea fiber optic cables via secret spy bases near the Strait of Hormuz and Yemen. BT and Vodafone are implicated.Duncan Campbell, \\"Revealed: Beyond top secret British intelligence Middleeast Internet spy base\\", The Register, June 3, 2014. The Danish newspaper Dagbladet Information and The Intercept revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed RAMPART-A. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory. Among the partners participating in the NSA mass surveillance program are Denmark and Germany.  July 2014  During the week of July 4, a 31-year-old male employee of Germany's intelligence service BND was arrested on suspicion of spying for the United States. The employee is suspected of spying on the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. Former NSA official and whistleblower William Binney spoke at a Centre for Investigative Journalism conference in London. According to Binney, \\"at least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.\\" He also stated that the majority of fiber optic cables run through the U.S., which \\"is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in.\\" The Washington Post released a review of a cache provided by Snowden containing roughly 160,000 text messages and e-mails intercepted by the NSA between 2009 and 2012. The newspaper concluded that nine out of ten account holders whose conversations were recorded by the agency \\"were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else.\\" In its analysis, The Post also noted that many of the account holders were Americans. On July 9, a soldier working within Germany's Federal Ministry of Defence (BMVg) fell under suspicion of spying for the United States. As a result of the July 4 case and this one, the German government expelled the CIA station chief in Germany on July 17. On July 18, former State Department official John Tye released an editorial in The Washington Post, highlighting concerns over data collection under Executive Order 12333. Tye's concerns are rooted in classified material he had access to through the State Department, though he has not publicly released any classified materials.  August 2014  The Intercept reported that the NSA is \\"secretly providing data to nearly two dozen U.S. government agencies with a 'Google-like' search engine\\" called ICREACH. The database, The Intercept reported, is accessible to domestic law enforcement agencies including the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration and was built to contain more than 850 billion metadata records about phone calls, emails, cellphone locations, and text messages.  February 2015  Based on documents obtained from Snowden, The Intercept reported that the NSA and GCHQ had broken into the internal computer network of Gemalto and stolen the encryption keys that are used in SIM cards no later than 2010. , the company is the world's largest manufacturer of SIM cards, making about two billion cards a year. With the keys, the intelligence agencies could eavesdrop on cell phones without the knowledge of mobile phone operators or foreign governments.  March 2015  The New Zealand Herald, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed that the New Zealand government used XKeyscore to spy on candidates for the position of World Trade Organization director general and also members of the Solomon Islands government.  April 2015  In January 2015, the DEA revealed that it had been collecting metadata records for all telephone calls made by Americans to 116 countries linked to drug trafficking. The DEA's program was separate from the telephony metadata programs run by the NSA. In April, USA Today reported that the DEA's data collection program began in 1992 and included all telephone calls between the United States and from Canada and Mexico. Current and former DEA officials described the program as the precursor of the NSA's similar programs. The DEA said its program was suspended in September 2013, after a review of the NSA's programs and that it was \\"ultimately terminated.\\"  January 2016  * NSA documents show the US and UK spied on Israeli military drones and fighter jets.

The film premiered at the Film Society of Lincoln Center on November 6, 2013, and was later released on video on demand on February 7, 2014. Haunt stars Harrison Gilbertson as a teenager who moves into a new house and goes through not only a sexual awakening but also a terrifying haunting. Plot A distraught man, Frank, tries to speak to his dead children in the afterlife by using an EVP box; soon thereafter, he is mysteriously possessed by a ghost, which then apparently causes him to kill himself. After this incident, a woman who will come to be known to the viewer as Dr. Morello begins narrating about her family and how they were murdered one by one by an unknown force. When Evan Asher (Harrison Gilbertson) and his family move into the old Morello house some years later, they are largely unaware that it has a history of death and grief. After having difficulties sleeping, Evan goes for a walk where he meets Samantha Richards crying as a result of her drunk, abusive father. They say goodbye but she sneaks into his bed that same night. Soon after their arrival Evan begins to experience paranormal activity and enlists Samantha's (Liana Liberato) help to uncover what is going on. As the two teens spend more and more time with each other, they begin to fall in love and in the course of exploring the house, find the same EVP box from before. Not really expecting anything to actually happen, they use it to speak with the dead and it starts working. The ghosts continue haunting the two teens as well as psychically contacting the youngest child (leaving the parents unaware of the whole situation), and at the urging of Dr. Morello, whom they deduce might know something about the hauntings, the frightened Evan and Sam decide to burn the box and the belongings of the previous owners. They also seal the small room in their attic bedroom where the box was found. However, these actions fail to work as hoped and the ghost of a woman haunts them that night and locks the door. It is then revealed to Sam in a psychic vision that the ghost is vengeful. Frank Morello had an affair with a woman who was his neighbor and his wife's patient . This woman gave birth to a daughter revealed to be Samantha . Doctor Morello finds out about the affair and brutally kills the woman while the weak-willed Frank stands by and watches, holding the daughter he sired. The woman is then buried in a small room in the attic, where Evan is staying now. Sam is then possessed by her mother's spirit who in turn kills Evan by bludgeoning him with a hammer saying \\"You shouldn't have burned the box, you shouldn't have closed the room.\\" Sam is caught by Evan's father when she tries to open the wooden plank in the floor under which the woman's body is buried, calling out \\"Mommy\\" the whole time. She is arrested and taken away by the cops. The movie ends with the voice of Dr. Morello wondering if Evan will haunt that house forever like she believes the members of her family will.

Production and filming for the movie was set to begin in Utah in November 2012, and Jacki Weaver was confirmed to be performing in Haunt. In early 2013 QED International launched a viral website that detailed the fictional Morello House, portraying it as a real paranormal case study. Reception Fearnet gave Haunt a mostly positive review, noting that while the film's story \\"won't win many awards for originality\\", that Haunt did bring in some new ideas and that overall \\"it's a respectably old-school chiller that feels sort of refreshing after watching so many high-tech, post-modern, and uber-subversive horror flicks.\\" We Got This Covered also commented on the film's familiarity to similarly-themed haunted house films, but praised Carter's directing as they felt that it helped keep it from becoming \\"another genre copy with a ghost, a story, and absolutely no intrigue.\\" In contrast, Shock Till You Drop gave the film a more mixed review, commenting that it was \\"competently made\\" but that \\"no matter how well-made it is, you have seen every minute of this movie before\\".

Those of us who were privileged to know him as a friend are ...\\" Handford was born in Salisbury. He was principal horn of the Hall√© Orchestra 1949‚Äì61, then associate conductor 1966‚Äì71, and staff conductor. He died in Warminster. The following article was published in The Daily Telegraph on 17 December 1986, shortly after his death: \\"Maurice Handford who has died aged 58, was a conductor with a wide range in repertoire. Although he was perhaps not a familiar figure to concert goers on the South Bank, he was well known to audiences in the rest of the country and from 1971 to 1975 was principal conductor of the Calgary Symphony Orchestra. Born in Salisbury, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music. He was a horn player and for 12 years, from 1949 to 1961, he was principal Horn in Barbirolli's Hall√©. Although he did not have a big tone, he had a natural feeling for tone colour and was unfailingly accurate, one rarely heard a 'fluff' in any of his orchestral solos. He had ambitions to be a conductor and was assisted by the patronage of ICI (Blackley), which invited him to conduct the works orchestra and, in May 1960, sponsored a Hall√© concert in Manchester at which he conducted Berlioz‚Äôs Symphony Fantastique. He was also helped by Barbirolli, who invited him to conduct some Hall√© industrial concerts. By 1962 he was sufficiently launched to be given charge of the first Hall√© performance of Orff‚Äôs Carmina Burana. Soon he was conducting works of the size of Strauss‚Äôs Also sprach Zarathustra and Shostakovich's 12th symphony. Barbirolli concert. Through the rest of the 1960s, until Barbirolli‚Äôs death in 1970, Handford conducted most of the adventurous works in the Hall√© repertoire and in 1963 was appointed Associate Conductor, at first jointly with Lawrence Leonard, but after 1966 on his own. Sir John trusted him enough to let him conduct Elgar and Vaughan Williams symphonies in which he himself excelled, but Handford never followed his mentor into Mahler and Bruckner. He was responsible for performances of Messiaen‚Äôs Turangalila Symphony, Schoenberg's Erwartung and for introducing to Manchester the music of Lutoslawski and Penderecki. But no assignment was more difficult than in September, 1970 when he conducted Elgar's Dream of the Gerontius in memory of Barbirolli, a performance that rose both musically and emotionally to the occasion. Handford had every expectation that the Hall√© conductorship would then be his. He was bitterly resentful when he was passed over and in 1971 he resigned as Associate Conductor, the Hall√© management had probably reasoned that he had not at that time had sufficient experience with other orchestras and that he was not a ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù as far as audiences were concerned. Nevertheless, it was still to Handford that the Hall√© turned when a Bruno Maderna concert had to be undertaken at short notice or when Elgar‚Äôs The Apostles and Delius‚Äôs Mass of Life needed revival, or a concert version of Porgy and Bess was planned. He was by now in demand with other orchestras, such as the BBC Northern and Welsh, the CBSO and the Ulster, where his willingness to take on the unfamiliar was appreciated. Unobtrusive style He was for a time a conductor of the Liverpool Welsh Choral Union and until 1972 conducted the annual opera and choral performances of the Northern School of Music, Manchester. His virtues as a trainer of students were also recognised by the Royal Academy of Music, where he conducted several remarkable performances. Although the compilers of ‚ÄòNew Grove‚Äô did not consider him worthy of inclusion and record companies virtually ignored him, Handford's unobtrusive style and his ability to get to the heart of a score were appreciated by musicians. He was not the flamboyant maestro and this may have held back his career in quarters where flashier talents are admired. But those who heard his finest Elgar performances and his lucid readings of complex contemporary works will know that music making in this country is much the poorer for his premature and lamented death.\\" ReferencesExternal links * National Portrait Gallery Category:1929 births Category:1986 deaths Category:British male conductors (music) Category:20th-century British conductors (music) Category:20th-century British male musicians ","title":"Maurice Handford"},{"id":"41909989","text":"\\"Isobel\\" is the 21st episode of the first season of The CW television series, The Vampire Diaries and the 21st episode of the series overall. It originally aired on May 6, 2010. The episode was written by Caroline Dries and Brian Young and directed by J. Miller Tobin. Plot Isobel (Mia Kirshner) and Alaric (Matt Davis) talk at the Grill. Alaric asks Isobel why she left him to become a vampire and she says that is what she always wanted. Isobel wants to meet Elena (Nina Dobrev) and asks Alaric to arrange a meeting for her but he refuses to do it and leaves. Isobel follows him and attacks him at the parking lot. She threatens to kill all his students if he will not do what she asked and leaves. At Mystic High Alaric sets Matt (Zach Roerig) and Tyler (Michael Trevino) to work together and help to build the Founder's Day float before he sees Elena and Stefan (Paul Wesley) from afar and leaves. The two friends still do not talk to each other after Tyler made out with Matt's mother, Kelly, even though Tyler tries to apologize. Meanwhile, Caroline (Candice Accola) asks Bonnie (Kat Graham) what is going on between her and Elena but Bonnie does not want to say. Alaric gets Elena and Stefan at his classroom to talk to them about Isobel's request. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) joins them a little bit later since Alaric called him. Damon is surprised hearing that Isobel is in town and wonders if she is working with John (David Anders) and why she wants the Gilbert device. When they tell him that the only thing she wants is to meet Elena, Damon tells Elena that she does not have to meet her if she does not want it but Elena agrees and meets her later at the Grill. Elena and Isobel meet at the Grill while Stefan sits a few tables away for protection. Isobel is surprised of how much Elena looks like Katherine and says that Katherine found her after she became a vampire. Elena wants to know who her father is but Isobel has no any intentions of telling her. Instead, she reveals the real reason she wanted to meet Elena which is no other than the Gilbert device, the same one that John wants. Elena asks how she knows John and Isobel admits that John was in love with her in the past and that he was the one who told her about vampires. Elena refuses to help her with the device and Isobel threatens her that she has to do it. She leaves and Bonnie enters the Grill. She sees Elena upset but she turns around when she sees Stefan approaching her. At the Gilbert house, Jeremy (Steven McQueen) keeps calling and leaving messages to Anna (Malese Jow) from who he did not hear since she went home and found her mother dead, something that Jeremy does not know. John hears Jeremy leaving the message and talking to Jenna (Sara Canning) about it and he tells him that if he wants to talk about girls he is there. Jeremy is surprised by the offer and he just leaves. Isobel comes back home and finds Damon waiting for her. The two of them have a talk and Isobel tells Damon that it is Katherine the one who wants the device and Damon warns her to stay away from the people he cares about. Before he leaves, he delivers a message for Katherine; that if she wants the device then she should come and take it herself. Bonnie shows up at Elena's house feeling bad for not talking to her at the Grill while she saw how upset she was and she apologizes. Elena tells her that she met her birth mother. Elena tells her about the device and later, Bonnie asks her to come and she shows Elena Emily's spellbook. Bonnie explains that Emily was the one responsible for all of Jonathan Gilbert's inventions since she was casting spell on them making him believe that they were working. From the book they learn that the device is a weapon against the vampires and that it's consisted of two parts. Damon only has one part of it. Back outside at school's yard, Isobel shows up in front of Elena saying that she wants to be involved in her life. Elena refuses her \\"offer\\" and Isobel points out that she knows every one of Elena's friends; Bonnie, Caroline, Matt and her little brother Jeremy. To show her that she can hurt them without second thought, she has one of her compelled friends to jump on the float Matt's working on pinning his arm underneath. Tyler and Stefan run to help Matt, while Isobel's other compelled friend kidnaps Jeremy. She promises Elena to kill him if she will not bring her the device. Elena, Stefan and Bonnie try to figure out how to get the device from Damon who does not want to hand it over, especially now that he knows what it does. Bonnie convinces them that she can remove the spell Emily put on it and that way, Isobel or anyone else won't be able to use it to kill vampires. Damon has his doubts but he eventually gives in and hands the device over to Elena. Bonnie works on the device and few moments later she says that she has removed the spell. John arrives at Isobel's place and sees that Isobel kidnapped Jeremy. He tries to convince her to let him go but she orders her two friends to attack him. She removes the ring that protects him and leaves on the floor bleeding. Jeremy and John are alone and Jeremy asks what Isobel wants. John explains that there is a group of vampires who are out there and want revenge, and he and Isobel want to kill them. Elena meets Isobel in the town square. Elena came with Damon and Stefan while Isobel came with her two friends for back-up. Elena does not want to hand over the device until she knows Jeremy is fine. Isobel tells her to call home and she does. Jeremy answers the phone and says that everything is fine. Elena believes that Isobel was never going to hurt Jeremy, but Isobel tells her that she was sure Elena would get the device from Damon because Damon is in love with her. She hands over the device and Isobel leaves warning her that as long as she has the Salvatores in her life she is doomed. Back at home, Elena tries to talk to Jeremy and make up with him but Jeremy still worries about Anna. He admits to Elena that he knows what Anna is and everything else because he read her journal. He is mad at Elena for letting Damon erase his memory and while Elena tries to apologize, Jeremy will not listen and shuts the door in her face. After Elena leaves, Anna shows up crying and tells him that her mother is dead and she had nowhere else to go. Isobel finds Alaric to say goodbye before she goes. Alaric wonders why she bothered since she did not do it the first time. The two of them have an intense conversation where Alaric removes his ring that protects him and throws the vervain he has on the floor daring her to either kill him or compel him. Isobel compels him to stop looking for her, she puts his ring back on his finger and leaves. At the Salvatore house, Stefan tries to talk to Damon about what Isobel said; him being in love with Elena. Damon doesn't deny the accusation but Stefan makes it clear that Elena is not Katherine and history will not repeat itself. Damon, changes the subject and tells Stefan that Elena's birth father is John. Stefan asks if he has any proof for that but Damon says that he does not need one since he put everything together and it is clear that it is John. Isobel calls John to tell him that she left the device at his doorstep along with his ring. He promises to do what Katherine wants and he will kill all the tomb vampires. Isobel asks him to kill Damon and Stefan as well because she does not want their daughter (revealing that John is Elena's father) to have this life. John reassures her that he will take care of it. The episode ends with Bonnie talking to Caroline. She admits that she lied to Elena that she would do something but she did not and she knows that when Elena finds out, she will never forgive her.

Reviews \\"Isobel\\" received positive reviews. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.1/5. \\"On \\"Isobel,\\" The Vampire Diaries took a breath. It wasn't as fast-paced as many other episodes, but it moved the necessary pieces into place for next week's season finale and it dropped a bomb on us: John Gilbert is Elena's father!\\" Richenthal closes his review saying: \\"Looking ahead to the May 13 finale, we hope John doesn't go through with his plan to kill Stefan and Damon, that's for sure. But if this somehow happened, we could understand why. That's an impressive feat for the show to pull off.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3/4. \\"This episode began with conflicts, and ended with even more. Bonnie‚Äôs ploy, Founder‚Äôs Day, Stefan‚Äôs anger at Damon‚Äôs love for Elena, Elena‚Äôs parentage, whether or not John will figure out that Anna is a vampire: so many of these conflicts center on knowledge that some people have and others don‚Äôt.\\" Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 4/4. \\"This episode shows the skill with which the series is structured. It works as a self-contained episode, focusing on Isobel‚Äôs visit to town. It also works as a set-up to the season finale that will follow. Both the external and emotional conflicts of the season are positioned to come to a climax.\\" Popsugar from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that it was an amazing, climactic one. \\"With an episode titled as modestly as \\"Isobel,\\" I was expecting some reveals about Elena's birth mother, but I wasn't expecting the onslaught of revelations that this week had to offer.\\" Meg of Two Cents TV gave a good review to the episode saying that the reunion of mother and daughter included more death threats and face slaps than hugs and flowers. \\" This was a great episode ‚Äì the first one where I‚Äôve seen any depth to Uncle J‚Äôs character. Mia Kirshner could not have been more perfectly cast.\\" Jen Yamato from HitFix praised Kirshner for her portrayal as Isobel saying that she is possibly the most amazing guest performance in the entire series thus far. \\"The woman should win an award for general bad-assery from this episode alone. Because as much as she convinces you to love to hate her for much of \\"Isobel,\\" Kirshner pulls out some revelatory material in the ep's final moments that instantly makes her one of this show's most intriguing and compelling characters.\\" References Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 1) episodes ","title":"Isobel (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"41909992","text":"Crespo Asiku is a Ugandan professional footballer, who plays as a Forward for Bul FC.

Background Fraser was born in Leeds, Yorkshire to Scottish parents. She was educated at Queen's Park Higher Grade School, Glasgow. She opened a studio in Glasgow that specialised in black and white illustration work and embroidery.Helen Fraser, Spartacus Educational Political career She joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) after hearing Teresa Billington speak in Glasgow. She travelled to England to help the WSPU campaign at the 1906 Huddersfield by-election. She became Treasurer of the Glasgow WSPU and a WSPU Scottish Organiser, one of the fifty-eight funded branches in the UK. On 20 December 1906, with Flora Drummond, Fraser and three others attempted to enter the Stranger's Lobby in the Parliament, and after a skirmish Drummond was arrested. In 1907, Fraser organised the WSPU campaign, using press publicity handbills about the demonstrators ' CRUSHED BY THE MOUNTED POLICE AGAINST THE RAILINGS OF THE ABBEY, AND TRAMPLED UNDER THEIR HORSES HOOFS'. Fraser had the help of Mary Phillips in East Fife and during the 1907 Aberdeen South by-election she met Adela Pankhurst with whom she remained close friends throughout her life. Her sister Annie, along with Maggie Moffatt, became one of the first Scottish suffragettes to be arrested. In 1907, Janie Allan, being inspired by Fraser and Theresa Billington-Greig speaking about suffragette activity and organised a large WSPU meeting in St. Andrew's Hall, Glasgow. Fraser also took a prominent role in the WSPU's 1907 Hexham by-election campaign; for which by the Daily Mail praised her. She worked with Rachel Barrett, Elsa Gye and Mary Gawthorpe during the Dundee by-election the next year. In 1908, Fraser attended the 'monster meeting' Women's Sunday and wrote to Isabel Seymour that it was 'successful but not entirely satisfactory', Fraser estimated half a million people attended ( a number supported by The Times estimates) but said that at three of the speaker platforms 'there was much rowdyism' and said 'it seemed to me that the mass of people were simply curious - not opposed- simply indifferent. Fraser was also becoming disillusioned with the violent militant tactics of the WSPU. She criticised the actions of one WSPU member who broke the windows of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She resigned from the WSPU soon afterwards, and was approached by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) and agreed to work for them. She was a member of the NUWSS national executive committee for fourteen years. Fraser was effective as a public speaker and had speaking engagements not just in Scotland, but all around the UK. In a one-year period (1908‚Äì09), her meetings collected a total of ¬£56.19.10 for the NUWSS. In 1912, she spoke at a meeting in Cambridge organised by the Cambridge Women's Suffrage Association, held during a course of University Extension Lectures. In 1915, she acted as temporary Honorary Secretary of the Penarth Women's Suffrage Society. During the First World War, she worked as a Commissioner for the National War Saving Committee,The Woman's Year Book, 1923. in the course of which she personally set up 109 local War Savings Committees in England and Wales. She was seconded to the Board of Agriculture to persuade women to work on the land. In 1917, at the suggestion of Millicent Fawcett, she was included by the UK Government as part of the official British War Mission to the US, to speak about Britain's war effort. She travelled through 40 states and spoke 332 times in 312 days. She also had a meeting with President Woodrow Wilson. In 1918, upon her return to Britain, her book of the tour Women and War Work was published. In 1918, when women gained the right to stand as parliamentary candidates, she turned her attention to the campaign to elect women as Members of Parliament. She spoke in Cardiff on behalf of the Joint Committee for Getting Women into Parliament. She did not contest the 1918 general election. She took an active role in the affairs of a number of organisations; she was a member of the Executive Committee, of the NUWSS successor organisation the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, she was a member of the Common Interests Committee of the English-Speaking Union, she was involved in the Reunion of British War Missions in USA, she was a member of the Council for the Representation of Women in the League of Nations and she was a Member of the British Institute of International Affairs. Her efforts during the war and after had come to the attention of Prime Minister David Lloyd George and she joined his National Liberal organisation. In 1922, she was the first woman to be adopted in Scotland as an official prospective parliamentary candidate when she was selected as National Liberal candidate for the Govan Division of Glasgow for the 1922 general election. She was one of only three women candidates (all Liberals) to contest the general election in Scotland. Govan was a safe Labour seat and she was not expected to win. Fraser was a prominent member of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage (GWSAWS). She had the GWSAWS backing to stand in Govan on the platform of the Liberal manifesto. This platform included the establishment of widows' pensions and an equal franchise for women. During her campaign she criticised her male Labour party opponent's \\"appropriation of our feminist ideals and policies.\\"Gender and Political Identities in Scotland, 1919‚Äì1939 By Annmarie Hughes In 1923 she went to Paris, France to attend the conference of the International Alliance of Women for Suffrage and Equal Citizenship as a delegate of the NUWSS. Later in 1923, following re-union between Lloyd George and Asquith, she switched constituencies to stand as Liberal party candidate for the Hamilton Division of Lanarkshire at the 1923 general election. Though also a Labour seat, it was believed that her prospects here were a little better. However, abuse and calumny by the Labour Party candidate Duncan Macgregor Graham made the experience a thoroughly unpleasant one. Her last political invitation was to fight the 1924 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election\\"The By-Elections.\\" Times [London, England] 10 May 1924: 12. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 February 2014. but the Conservative candidate Walter Elliot was a friend, and she knew that she could poll enough votes to cause him to lose the seat, so she refused and gave up the idea of a career in politics. Fraser then moved to London, earning money from freelance articles on women's issues. She was elected to Kensington Borough Council, sitting as a member for seven years. Personal life and political activities in Australia While living in London, Fraser was in contact with an old friend named James Moyes who had emigrated to Australia. His wife had died, and he asked Fraser to marry him several times before she accepted. She emigrated to Sydney in 1939. She later became the President of Women for Canberra, an organisation established to get more women to stand for election to the Australian Parliament Late in her life she wrote an autobiography, entitled A Woman in a Man's World, that was published in 1971.

He, together with Kalyanananda was responsible for setting up and running the Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama, Kankhal. He was inspired by Vivekananda's philosophy of serving man as God and dedicated his life to serve poor and downtrodden in the remote areas where no healthcare facility existed. He worked in military service before joining the Ramakrishna Order as a direct monastic disciple of Vivekananda. He met Vivekananda in Madras and decided to become his disciple. After Vivekananda's death, he went for pilgrimage and by chance came to Haridwar where he met his brother disciple Kalyanananda and joined him in carrying out the works of Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal. Pre Monastic Life Nischayananda was born in 1865 in a small village near Janjira in Maharashtra. His pre monastic name was Suraj Rao. He was known as Raoji. He studied for a few years in an English school but could not complete his study owing to family poverty. He knew several South Indian languages and in later life could also speak fluently in Bengali. After leaving school and not finding any suitable vocation he joined military service in South Karnataka regiment. As part of his job he traveled to many places, esp. pilgrimage spots in India. He also traveled abroad to Burma, Siam (Thailand), Gibraltar, Malta etc. He went to Andaman and studied the life of the tribals residing there and collected many information about their way of life. He was a first class shot and secured high rank in shooting competition in the military. He was promoted to the rank of lance corporal. Once while he was in Raipur, he met Niranjananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. Niranjananda introduced him to spiritual life and instilled in him a desire to meet Vivekananda, who was in West at that time. Suraj Rao went through all news and information that appeared about Vivekananda. In January 1897 when Vivekananda returned to India and was traveling through South India. Suraj Rao was one of the large crowd of villagers who had stopped the train carrying Vivekananda to Madras, to have a glimpse of him. He traveled by foot to Madras and met Vivekananda in Castle Kernan. Because he wanted to renounce the world and follow the footsteps of Vivekananda, which was hindered by his service commitment, Suraj Rao feigned insanity and was discharged from the military service. Immediately upon discharge he traveled to Calcutta and met Vivekananda in 1901. He was subsequently initiated by Vivekananda into monastic life who gave him the name Nischayananda (Nischaya - determination). Nischayananda, sitting in the front most row. Vivekananda is sitting in the middle row Monastic Life Swami Nischayananda was assigned the responsibility of looking after Swami Vivekananda as his attendant. He discharged his duties and responsibilities as a worship. He used to daily fetch drinking water in a huge vessel for Swami Vivekananda from a tube well from Baranagar on the other side of Ganga. Once when Josephine MacLeod, an American friend of Swami Vivekananda, had advised Swami Nischayananda to assign this task to a servant, the latter was annoyed. Swami Vivekananda, who understood the reason for the dedicated labour, explained to Ms. MacLeod that she had offended the sense of devotion of his disciple because in India it was imperative for a disciple to serve his master in every possible way. On another occasion he was sent to purchase a milch cow for Belur Math and Swami Vivekananda had instructed him not to let go of the rope to which the cow would be tethered. While crossing the river Ganga, the cow had jumped into the river and Nischayananda, in order to not let it go, jumped into the water and dragged the cow to the other bank, risking his own life in the process, but never letting go of the rope. Swami Nischayananda was deeply influenced by both Shivaji and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the two Maharashtrian icons. Tilak had visited Belur Math and met Swami Vivekananda in 1901. Swami Nischayananda affirmed that Tilak was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's point of view about serving the poor with a view to uplift them. Swami Nischayananda left Belur Math within a month of passing away of Swami Vivekananda. As per his testimony to Swami Saradananda in this regard, he came to Belur Math to work for Vivekananda and therefore had no further desire to stay after the latter's death. He became a wandering monk and visited various holy places, and spent his days in spiritual practices. He arrived in Haridwar to participate in Haridwar in 1903. There he met Swami Kalyanananda, another direct monastic disciple of Swami Vivekananda, who had already established the Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama in Kankhal, near Haridwar. Swami Vivekananda had explicitly instructed Swami Nischayananda not to accept food without providing some kind of service to the community. Therefore the latter joined Swami Kalyanananda in serving the poor and the sick in that region. The orthodox monks used to deride this spirit of service since according to traditional customs a monk should not indulge in any form of actions. However Kalyanananda and Nischayananda got strong backing from Dhanraj Giri, a very senior and well respected head of Kailash Math and a reputed scholar of Vedanta. Dhanraj Giri's strong support resulted in acceptance of the two disciples of Swami Vivekananda and their work among the community of monks in Northern India. He was very austere in his spiritual practices and continued spiritual practices like meditation at night, despite a hard toil during the day. Contribution Swami Nischayananda worked with his brother disciple to develop the Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal into a hospital for the treatment of poor and needy. He himself nursed the patients, cleaned their bedpans and lavatories, prepared food and washed them. If a patient died they also carried the body to the river to immerse it as per the customs. His daily routine consisted in waking up early in the morning, carrying a medicine box and a bundle of other necessary articles, and walking to Rishikesh which was twenty eight kilometres up the hill. There he would go from place to place inquiring about the well being of the monks and other itinerants, treat the sick and feed the disabled. In the evening he would walk all the way back to Kankhal. At noon he would go for begging his food. In the evening he would at times bring patients from Rishikesh to the Sevashrama. This he did for many years at a stretch. For three decades, both the brother-monks, Kalyanananda and Nischayananda tirelessly kept serving pilgrims and local people in the Kumbha Mela by providing medical care and assistance. They served the pilgrims and monks in all the three Purna Kumbha Melas held in 1903, 1915 and 1927. Last Days Swami Nischayananda fell ill with a gastric ulcer, and died on 22 October 1934 while sitting in the lotus posture. Legacy The Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal (http://www.rkmkankhal.org/index.html) still stands. According to Abjajananda the spirit of worshiping God in every human being as ideal was finally accepted by the orthodox monks of the region when they saw the work of the two monks of Ramakrishna Order.

The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, Connie Britton, Walton Goggins, John Leguizamo, Bill Pullman, and Tony Hale. The story is about a stoner who discovers he was part of a secret government program and is a sleeper agent. It was released on August 21, 2015, by Lionsgate. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and underperformed at the box office. Plot Mike Howell is a stoner who lives in the sleepy town of Liman, West Virginia, where he works as a convenience store clerk. He is planning to propose to his longtime girlfriend, Phoebe Larson, on a trip to Hawaii. He is unable to board the plane, as he suffers from intense panic attacks anytime he tries to leave town. He does not understand why Phoebe puts up with him. In Langley, Virginia, CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her \\"Wiseman\\" Ultra program, is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates, and his similar \\"Toughguy\\" agents. Feeling a duty to protect Mike, Lasseter travels to Liman and \\"activates\\" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves in resigned frustration. Mike finds two Toughguys interfering with his car and is attacked, but his training activates and he kills them using a spoon. He calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher and Crane, to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealer Rose. Mike becomes unnerved by an array of facts he suddenly knows regarding military strategy. He also realizes he has very little memory prior to living in the town with Phoebe, wondering aloud why he never questioned this before. Yates quarantines the city, and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter convinces her former assistant, Petey Douglas, to air drop her a weapon using a drone. Yates finds out and threatens to charge Petey with treason. Yates then attacks Rose's house with two Toughguys using a lethal gas. The agents kill Rose and his two guards, Big Harold and Wuinzin, before Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers and she rescues Mike from the gas, which she is familiar with. When pressed for answers on her knowledge of the gas, Phoebe reluctantly reveals she was a CIA agent assigned to be Mike's handler, leaving him heartbroken. Laugher ambushes the duo and captures Phoebe. Mike is rescued by Lasseter and insists on returning to his house. She tells him that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his memories erased. He also learns that Phoebe was to get him settled in Liman and then leave, but chose to stay because she genuinely fell in love. Lasseter explains that his panic attacks, including his fear of leaving town, were implanted to keep him safe. Yates‚Äô army liaison, Otis, joins a Toughguy to attack Mike‚Äôs house. Mike and Lasseter kill them, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey calls off the drone strike at the last minute, then secretly reports the situation to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger. Mike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, whom he spares when Mike learns he is a mentally unbalanced man forcibly conscripted by Yates. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her. Phoebe and Mike leave the store under gunpoint of multiple law enforcement officers, as he proposes to her. In a forested area, Krueger has Yates and Lasseter bound and kneeling. Yates argues that what he was doing would have been okay with Krueger, despite the deaths of innocent people, if the results had been successful, and Krueger agrees. Yates, smugly smiles and stands, but is executed by Krueger for his failure. Krueger admits he informed Lasseter of Yates‚Äô plan as a courtesy but did not expect her to intervene. She points out that, by taking out seventeen Toughguys, Mike is proof of the success of the Wiseman program and a potentially valuable asset. Six months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are in Manila, confident and happy together as they carry out a CIA assignment. CastProduction Kristen Stewart in 2014, with her hair dyed \\"orangey-red\\" for the role. Writer Max Landis was inspired by a top secret CIA program from the 1950's code named MK Ultra, which conducted experiments on humans to develop superior agents through various mind control techniques. He wondered what it would be like if an ordinary stoner guy had been subjected to the program. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Eisenberg and Stewart were on board the project, having previously starred together in the film Adventureland. On March 14, it was announced Goggins had been cast in the film. On April 1, Grace joined the film. On April 14, Pullman and Hale joined the cast. On April 15, it was announced Sharon Stone had been cast in the film; it was later reported Britton would be replacing her. Filming Principal photography began on April 14, 2014 in Louisiana near New Orleans and wrapped in mid-June. Filming in Louisiana presented challenges, the production had to deal with snakes, alligators, and torrential rain. Nourizadeh and director of photography Michael Bonvillain emphasized wide shots, and allowed the actors move around the set, with two cameras running to get coverage. The film was shot over a 43 day shooting schedule. The film received tax incentives for filming in Louisiana, and spent $20.4 million in the state and received $6.55 million in tax incentives. The film spent a further $3.3 million in post production in New York, and received $0.9 million in tax credits. Animation The \\"Apollo Ape\\" artwork was created by John Martel, a self-taught artist from Lake Charles, Louisiana. The promotional poster in the style of a comic book cover was done by artist Jim Evans. The end credits animation was made by Gary Leib. Leib worked on the animation over six months. Release In November 2013, Apsara Distribution announced that they had acquired the rights to distribute the film outside the United States. In March 2014, Lionsgate announced their acquisition of the North American rights to the film, for $7 million. In April 2015, Lionsgate set an August 21 release date for the film. The first still and two teaser posters were released on May 14, 2015 by MTV. The red band trailer was released by Yahoo! Movies on May 28, 2015. To promote the film at Comic-Con Lionsgate created a website offering free Marijuana to people with existing prescriptions. The film premiered in Los Angeles, at the Theatre at Ace Hotel. The film was released on August 21, 2015. It is the first film to be released with a DTS:X soundtrack. According to iSpot.TV Lionsgate spent $12.6 million on TV advertising to promote the film. Reception=Box office American Ultra grossed $14,439,985 in North America and $15,855,091 in other territories for a worldwide total of $30,295,076, against a budget of $28 million. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $5.5 million, finishing sixth at the box office and third among the week's new releases, behind Sinister 2 ($10.5 million) and Hitman: Agent 47 ($8.3 million). Landis reacted to the film's poor box office performance in a series of Twitter messages: In an interview with RedLetterMedia Landis elaborated on his comments, and further discussed the difficulties of making a film not based on existing intellectual property, and what he considered a misleading marketing campaign. Critical response American Ultra received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 43%, based on 173 reviews, with an average rating of 5.37/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"American Ultra has some interesting ideas, but like its stoned protagonist, it's too easily distracted to live up to its true potential.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 50 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Mark Kermode of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, stating \\"Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart brave an anarchic mish-mash with lots of violence but few laughs.\\" David Dishman of the McAlester News-Capital writes \\"American Ultra promoted itself under the slogan, \\"There is nothing more dangerous than a stoned cold killer,\\" and while they may be right, there's also nothing spectacular about that stoned cold killer's movie.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film two of four stars: \\"Soon the movie's twisty charm gives way to gory splatter. Eisenberg and Stewart stay appealing to the last. The movie, not so much.\\" Neil Genzlinger from The New York Times gave the film a mixed review, ending with \\"A lot of it seems familiar, and Mr. Eisenberg and Ms. Stewart aren‚Äôt stretched much. But Mike finds amusing ways to defend himself using ordinary household items, Walton Goggins and John Leguizamo enliven things in goofy small roles, the plot has a nice twist or two, and your theater is probably air-conditioned.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter had mixed opinions of the film, calling it uneven and \\"A genre mash that's mildly amusing until it can't think of anything else to do besides flop around in the deep end of conspicuous gore.\\" He praises the supporting turns from Leguizamo, and Goggins. McCarthy gives particular praise to the animated end credits. Andrea Barker of Variety magazine welcomed the film, \\"In a summer film slate awash with reboots, sequels and dutifully box-checking superhero product, it‚Äôs refreshing to see a genre film made from a completely original screenplay\\" and praised the \\"clever ideas, bloody violence so cartoonish that it‚Äôs almost cuddly, and an eminently likable leading pair\\" but was critical of the inconsistent tone and didn't feel the end result came together as a whole. Barker concludes \\"Only at the end, with completely off-the-wall animated closing credits that embrace the film‚Äôs latent surreality, do we finally get a glimpse of what ‚ÄúAmerican Ultra‚Äù has been aching to become.\\" Some critics said the marketing was misleading, and Neil Gunzlinger of the New York Times described it as \\"a diverting summer action adventure with occasional laughs, not a diverting stoner comedy with occasional action.\\" Author Stephen King praised the film in a Twitter message: \\"Saw AMERICAN ULTRA last night, and loved it. Fresh and exciting, very cool. Can't figure out why it isn't a smash.\\" See also * List of films featuring drones * Drug-induced amnesia in popular culture ReferencesExternal links  * * , Category:2015 films Category:English-language films Category:2015 action comedy films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:American films about cannabis Category:American spy comedy films Category:Drone films Category:Films about the Central Intelligence Agency Category:Films about computing Category:Films about contract killing Category:Films about security and surveillance Category:Films scored by Marcelo Zarvos Category:Films set in Virginia Category:Films set in West Virginia Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Lionsgate films Category:Fiction about mind control Category:Films with screenplays by Max Landis Category:2010s spy comedy films Category:Techno-thriller films Category:Stoner films Category:2015 comedy films ","title":"American Ultra"},{"id":"41910293","text":"John Keenan (born 19 December 1964, in Glasgow) is the bishop of the Diocese of Paisley in Scotland.

Early life and family G√ºn Sazak was born on March 26, 1932 in Ankara to Emin Sazak and his wife Ay≈üe. His father was a member of parliament from the Republican People's Party (CHP) and later the Democrat Party (DP). His brother G√ºven Sazak served as the president of S√ºper Lig club Fenerbah√ße SK, and Yƒ±lmaz Sazak, was the president of the Turkish Athletic Federation. Sazak completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara. His family had extensive agricultural land at Sazak village in the Mihalƒ±√ß√ßƒ±k district of Eski≈üehir Province. Because of this land Sazak went in 1951 to the United States to study at the California State Polytechnic University College of Agriculture. After eight years, he returned home, and worked on a construction business and the family farm. Sazak achieved a significant increase in agricultural production by applying modern techniques. He was married to Nilg√ºn and they had a son named S√ºleyman Servet Sazak in 1955. Their son became a deputy of Eski≈üehir. The Sazaks also had two daughters, Mahmure G√ºlg√ºn Sazak, and Ay≈üe Bilg√ºn Sazak. Ay≈üe Bilg√ºn married textile businessman Cem Boyner. Politician career In 1971, G√ºn Sazak entered politics representing the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Sazak was elected to the post deputy chairman of the MHP in 1972 following a traffic accident which killed the previous holder of the post. At the 1977 general election, Sazak unsuccessfully ran for an Eski≈üehir Province seat in the parliament, representing the MHP. During the formation of the 41st government (the so- called Second Nationalist Front coalition cabinet) of S√ºleyman Demirel, Sazak was appointed Minister of Customs and Monopolies despite not being member of the parliament. He served as government minister 21 July 1977 until 5 January 1978. During his term he successfully fought corruption, smuggling and customs fraud. Sazak reduced arms trafficking conducted by organized crime and terrorism and imported cigarette smuggling. Customs corruption was said to be restored after he left the post. Abdi ƒ∞pek√ßi (1929‚Äì1979), the later- assassinated editor-in-chief of the daily Milliyet, who opposed Sazak's politically, had praised Sazak in a column on October 12, 1978 for his achievement in re-establishing law and order at the customs. Another political opponent CHP stated during the 1978 budget debates that Sazak is the only person, who had stopped the \\"robbery\\" at the customs since the foundation of the Republic. G√ºn Sazak was also the chairman of the executive board at the daily Herg√ºn. Assassination G√ºn Sazak's official police guard was removed by an order of the martial law commander in Ankara. This was despite the risk to Sazak during a period of political unrest. On May 27, 1980, G√ºn Sazak was assassinated in front of his house by members of the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist terrorist group Revolutionary Left (), shortly Dev Sol. The terrorists, who were later identified as Mehmet Edip Eranƒ±l, Ahmet Levent Babacan, Sadƒ±k Zafer √ñzcan and Cengiz G√ºl arrived at Sazak's house around 19:00 hours and they then waited for Sazak's arrival. G√ºl shot and severely wounded G√ºn Sazak in his back as he arrived home around midnight. Sazak had got out of his car and he was trying to take his belongings out of the car's boot. Sazak died on his way to the hospital. It was later said that a passing minibus had hindered Babacan's shooting. The perpetrators left on foot and later caught a taxi. Aftermath After the assassination, G√ºl and Babacan delivered their handguns to 17-year-old Cem √ñz, another member of Dev Sol. Instructed by G√ºl, √ñzcan phoned the newspapers Milliyet and Terc√ºman and gave notice of Dev Sol's responsibility for the assassination. Two days after the assassination, MHP supporters were said to have spread propaganda about Sazak's death. Alevis in √áorum were attacked and there was a call to attack both Alevis and any left wing activists. The military restored order after 48 people were said to have died and numerous people had their faces mutilated. In July 1980, Dev Sol claimed responsibility for the assassination in its illegal journal Devrimci Sol. The capture of the assailants took time. The fugitives Eranƒ±l, who was the organization's Ankara office chief, Kemal Cemal Altun, a co-planner of the assassination, and G√ºl fled abroad after the military coup on September 12, 1980. G√ºl crossed the border to Greece first, and then went to Frankfurt, Germany. Sadƒ±k Zafer √ñzcan was apprehended on March 2, Ahmet Levent Babacan on March 7 and Cem √ñz on March 15, 1981. Ten months after the assassination, Babacan, √ñzcan and √ñz, were apprehended. On April 6, 1983, the 2nd Military Court of the Martial Law Command in Ankara sentenced Babacan to life imprisonment, √ñz to five year aggravated imprisonment and √ñzcan to six year aggravated imprisonment. Eranƒ±l, who was considered the mastermind behind the assassination hijacked a plane with three other accomplices. The Turkish Airlines airplane was on a domestic flight from Istanbul to Ankara and it was commanded to go to Burgas in Bulgaria on 24 May 1981. The hijackers asked for the release of nearly 50 prisoners in Turkey and half a million dollars. They were overpowered by their hostages and were arrested by the Bulgarian police. However, it was not revealed whether Eralƒ±n was extradited to Turkey or not. Eranƒ±l was reported to be running a caf√© in Duisburg, Germany in 2008. Altun was arrested in Germany on 5 July 1982 in connection with the assassination of former Turkish prime minister Nihat Erim. However Altun committed suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of the courthouse in West Berlin, Germany on August 30, 1983 to prevent his extradition to Turkey. In January 2013, a report of the National Intelligence Organization of Turkey (Mƒ∞T) revealed that the assassination of G√ºn Sazak was instructed by Dursun Karata≈ü (1952‚Äì2008), the leader of Dev Sol. Legacy A boulevard in Kar≈üƒ±yaka district of Izmir and streets in U≈üak and in Ke√ßi√∂ren, Ankara are named after him. A secondary boarding school in his family's hometown in Mihali√ß√ßƒ±k, Eski≈üehir bears his name.

The ultimate goal of the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach County, a nonprofit organization, is to ensure that every child and every adult in Palm Beach County becomes a reader. One in seven adults in Palm Beach County is unable to read and understand information found in books, newspapers, magazines, brochures and manuals. Through extensive outreach and collaboration with a network of community partners, the Literacy Coalition strives to ensure that individuals who need to improve their literacy skills receive the help they need. The organization's operates with the assistance of over 9,000 volunteers. In 2013, the Literacy Coalition provided services to more than 25,000 adults, children and families. History Representatives of business, government, libraries, the school district, the media, literacy providers and other community groups established the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach County in 1989. In 1990, a Literacy Hotline was established as a single contact point for volunteer tutors and adult learners. In 1991, the first Love of Literacy luncheon fundraiser was held. In 1997, Literacy AmeriCorps began with funding from the Corporation for Community and National Service for the purpose of recruiting, training, placing, and supervising members to perform literacy tutoring with adults, children, youth and families throughout Palm Beach County. Also in 1997, the Literacy Coalition participated in the America Reads Pilot Program, as one of 15 national sites to involve volunteers with reading to at-risk elementary and preschool children. Additional initiatives with which the organization has maintained involvement include, but are not limited to Care to Read, Early Reading First, Reach Out and Read, Read Together Palm Beach County, Village Readers Program, though which thousands of Palm Beach County residents have benefited.

Loop the Lake for Literacy Loop the Lake for Literacy is a fundraising and advocacy event hosted by the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach County. Participating bike riders follow a course along Lake Okeechobee's outer banks. The ride is one of the Literacy Coalition's most successful fundraising events. American Girl Fashion Show The American Girl Fashion Show is an event which raises money for the Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach County's education programs tailored to children, youth, and adults. Models provide an educational look at how generations of American Girls have used clothing to express their own unique style and personality. Programs=Adult Literacy The Outreach Program markets adult literacy programs throughout Palm Beach County as well as recruits adult learners and volunteer tutors. The populations targeted are adults needing basic literacy skills, proficiency in the English language and/or subject mastery needed to pass the GED test. In partnership with the School District of Palm Beach County, the Palm Beach County Library System Adult Literacy Project and a number of community-based organizations, the Literacy Coalition connects adult learners and volunteer tutors with local literacy programs. Budding Readers Budding Readers is an early literacy program that matches three-year-old children at child care centers with a Reading Partner for a weekly one-to-one interactive reading session. Reading Partners are intended to nurture the blossoming of these \\"budding readers\\" into lifelong lovers of books, reading and learning as they work with them to develop the early literacy skills they will need for future success in school. As of 2012, 16 Reading Partners at partnership sites served 417 children, 91 percent of the children demonstrated development in early literacy skills needed for future success in school and 4,917 books were distributed to children to begin a home library. Workplace and Community Education The Workplace and Community Education Program provides customized instruction for adults who need help improving their English language skills, obtaining a GED or addressing specific workplace needs. Classes are provided at workplace and community sites throughout the county by trained adult education instructors. Classes are tailored to each particular site and the skill levels of the students. The adult students, who attend classes twice a week, develop literacy skills to prepare them for enhanced employment opportunities and/or future education. Read Together Palm Beach County To involve 10,000 - 20,000 adults throughout Palm Beach County in reading the same book at the same time. This community reading campaign will entice adults who can read, but often don't, to get involved in the habit of reading again. It will also promote community dialogue and engagement as citizens gather together to discuss key themes. Former Governor Jeb Bush wrote to every city in Florida and encouraged them to form \\"One Book, One Community\\" reading campaigns based on the Palm Beach County model. Read Together Palm Beach County produced a handbook on how to conduct a similar reading campaign and Former Governor Bush urged municipalities to use this book to guide them in their campaigns. Participants include businesses, libraries, chambers of commerce, municipalities, local book clubs, neighborhood associations and many other groups. Pink Shirt Day The Literacy Coalition, in conjunction with Prime Time Palm Beach County, both of which receive significant funding from the Children's Services Council of Palm Beach County, encourage afterschool programs across Palm Beach County to participate with their own on-site celebrations of how bystanders can make a difference when it comes to bullying. Recognition In March 2012, the Quantum Foundation honored the Literacy Coalition with a \\"Change Leader\\" award for the service that has been provided to the community through the Literacy AmeriCorps program. The Palm Beach County School District has honored the Coalition with Above and Beyond, and Business Partnership Award for its work with children attending elementary schools in disadvantaged District neighborhoods. In 2005, the Literacy Coalition was one of 78 organizations selected nationally for the Bank of America Foundation's Neighborhood Builder Award for exhibiting \\"the highest standard in community building.\\" The Children's Services Council of Palm Beach County awarded the group its annual Striving for Excellence Award, in recognition of the Coalition's outstanding governance and administration. The Literacy Coalition has earned their five consecutive 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, indicating that the organization outperforms most other charities in the United States, and demonstrates to the public it is worthy of their trust. The Literacy Coalition was also among the first agencies to be certified by Nonprofits First, a Palm Beach County group advocating for efficiency in area nonprofit organization.

It was the 17th international horticultural exposition recognized by the Bureau International des Expositions.http://www.bie- paris.org/site/en/2003-rostock The park was created in a derelict area around ruins of the former village of Schmar on the banks of the river Warnow. This made it possible to have a connection between water and gardens.  The project IGA 2003  The project was more than the World Horticultural Exposition. The access roads to the newly built Warnow Tunnel, the new trade fair and congress centre, the integration of the historical ship type Frieden as a wharf museum, the reuse of the park after the exhibition and the improvement of infrastructure in Rostock were part of the project as well.  Participating countries  Thirty-two countries were represented with a national garden: Austria, Bolivia, Bulgaria, China, Colombia, Croatia, Finland, France, Greece, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Latvia, Luxembourg, Mauritania, Netherlands, North Korea, Pakistan, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Tanzania, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.  Financials  The preparation and furnishing of the terrain cost 62 million euros, the trade fair 32 million euros. The bills were paid by the City of Rostock, the State Mecklenburg- Vorpommern and the German federal government. 2.63 million people visited the exposition. The IGA 2003 met expectations as an attraction for holiday makers and tourists. More than half of the visitors came from outside Mecklenburg- Vorpommern and one third stayed in Rostock overnight, resulting in 50 million euros extra sales in this region. Despite this result the exposition closed with a deficit of 20 million euros due to lack of supervision by the authorities.  Events  Inside the trade fair During the IGA 2003, a total of 17,000 visitors attended 275 different meetings and congresses. 32 countries were represented with their own national gardens, and 20 of them got extra attention on the Nationentage. Visitors liked the national gardens, the aerial cable car, the floating garden, and the 25 alternating displays in the trade fair. Several outdoor events, totalling 1361 on 171 days, were held in the park. The main contributors were the Rostocker Volkstheater with 50 events, and the broadcaster NDR with their Open-Air-Veranstaltungen.  Willow Church  Willow church An architectural experiment was the Willow Church constructed during the preparations for the IGA 2003. It was the biggest living building of the world. The dome was 15 meters high and the church was 52 meters long. The building was designed by architect Marcel Kalberer, who also led the construction. 650 volunteers from 13 countries started building in 2001. 50 volunteers at the same time lived at a camp to knot and bundle the willow branches and set up the self-supporting construction. During the IGA an average of 300 visitors attended the mass on Sundays. 250 services took place, 3 of them marriages and 6 baptisms.  Reuse  Concrete ship Capella at the Warnow's embankment All park facilities and a part of the national gardens were retained and can still be visited. Access to the park however is restricted by a fence, its location outside the city and the entrance fares. The stage in the park and the Willow Church are still in use. The trade fair appears to be a financial burden for the city that still has to pay for the losses.Kein Platz f√ºr die Natur ‚Äì das Auslaufmodell Bundesgartenschau, Beitrag der Fernsehsendung ‚ÄûKontraste‚Äú, Manuskript auf rbb-online.de  References  External links  * IGA-Park * Weidendom * Official website of the BIE Category:World's fairs in Germany Category:International Horticultural Exhibitions Category:2003 in Germany ","title":"2003 World Horticultural Exposition"},{"id":"41910504","text":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a groupoid object in a category C admitting finite fiber products is a pair of objects R, U together with five morphisms s, t: R \\\\to U, e: U \\\\to R, m: R \\\\times_{U, t, s} R \\\\to R, i: R \\\\to R satisfying the following groupoid axioms # s \\\\circ e = t \\\\circ e = 1_U, \\\\, s \\\\circ m = s \\\\circ p_1, t \\\\circ m = t \\\\circ p_2 where the p_i: R \\\\times_{U, t, s} R \\\\to R are the two projections, # (associativity) m \\\\circ (1_R \\\\times m) = m \\\\circ (m \\\\times 1_R), # (unit) m \\\\circ (e \\\\circ s, 1_R) = m \\\\circ (1_R, e \\\\circ t) = 1_R, # (inverse) i \\\\circ i = 1_R, s \\\\circ i = t, \\\\, t \\\\circ i = s, m \\\\circ (1_R, i) = e \\\\circ s, \\\\, m \\\\circ (i, 1_R) = e \\\\circ t. A group object is a special case of a groupoid object.  Examples  Example: A groupoid object in the category of sets is precisely a groupoid in the usual sense: a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. Indeed, given such a category C, take U to be the set of all objects in C, R the set of all arrows in C, the five morphisms given by s(x \\\\to y) = x, \\\\, t(x \\\\to y) = y, m(f, g) = g \\\\circ f, e(x) = 1_x and i(f) = f^{-1}. Incidentally, one can consider a notion of a semigroupoid (unital semigroup = a category with a single object); but, according to this example, that is nothing but a category; so a groupoid object is really a special case of a \\"category object\\", better known as a stack (or prestack). A groupoid S-scheme is a groupoid object in the category of schemes over some fixed base scheme S. If U = S, then a groupoid scheme (where s = t are necessarily the structure map) is the same as a group scheme. A groupoid scheme is also called an algebraic groupoid, for example in , to convey the idea it is a generalization of algebraic groups and their actions. When the term \\"groupoid\\" can naturally refer to a groupoid object in some particular category in mind, the term groupoid set is used to refer to a groupoid object in the category of sets. Example: Suppose an algebraic group G acts from the right on a scheme U. Then take R = U \\\\times G, s the projection, t the given action. This determines a groupoid scheme.  Construction  Given a groupoid object (R, U), the equalizer of R \\\\overset{s}\\\\underset{t}\\\\rightrightarrows U, if any, is a group object called the inertia group of the groupoid. The coequalizer of the same diagram, if any, is the quotient of the groupoid. Each groupoid object in a category C (if any) may be thought of as a contravariant functor from C to the category of groupoids. This way, each groupoid object determines a prestack in groupoids. This prestack is not a stack but it can be stackified to yield a stack. The main use of the notion is that it provides an atlas for a stack. More specifically, let [R \\\\rightrightarrows U] be the category of (R \\\\rightrightarrows U)-torsors. Then it is a category fibered in groupoids; in fact, (in a nice case), a Deligne‚ÄìMumford stack. Conversely, any DM stack is of this form.  See also  *simplicial scheme  Notes  References  * *H.

The Library was founded in 1838 by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Karol Sienkiewicz, among others. Its first task was to safeguard all surviving books, documents, archives and treasures of national significance. It has become a historical and documentary resource open for the use of Poles and other researchers and visitors. The Library houses three museums related to significant Polish artists: the Salon Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, the Adam Mickiewicz Museum and the Boles≈Çaw Biegas Art collection. UNESCO's Memory of the World Register rates it as an institution unique of its kind. History David d'Angers - Adam Mickiewicz in 1835 The prime instigator for the creation of the Polish Library in Paris was Karol Sienkiewicz, who had managed to assemble the already existing book collections in the history and statistical departments of the Towarzystwo Literackie w Pary≈ºu, and the Towarzystwo Pomocy Naukowej, the Polish Literary and Scientific Aid societies. A critical role in the venture was played by the French Soci√©t√© de Civilisation, which, spurred on by the effect Adam Mickiewicz had with his article, \\"Rabunek bibliotek i muze√≥w w Polsce\\" - the pillage of libraries and museums in Poland - started a public appeal to garner support for a library dedicated to Poland. The act of foundation was signed in November 1838, followed in March 1839 by a gala opening of the building. A library committee consisting of eight delegates took on the running of the enterprise. Prince Czartoryski was elected as its life president, while the functions of secretary, librarian and treasurer were entrusted to Sienkiewicz. To satisfy French legal requirements, Czartoryski took on formal ownership of the institution, thus securing its material survival. The initial plan was to erect a purpose-built Polish mansion in Paris to house the collections, but the shortage of funds led to the abandonment of that ambition, and instead a 17th-century four storey mansion was bought, on the Ile Saint-Louis along the Quai d'Orleans. The library moved into eleven rooms on the second floor while the rest of the building was let as accommodation to finance the loans that had been taken out. Meanwhile, the Library saw rapid expansion as gifts and legacies arrived from private individuals, for instance the collections of Ma≈Çachowski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Karol Kniaziewicz and Adam Mickiewicz. By 1845 the Library held 15,000 volumes and three years later, almost 20,000 items. In 1914 the collection contained 100,000 books. In addition, there was a stock of journals and reviews, of photographs, and of medals and coins.Marek ≈ªukow-Karczewski, Biblioteka przy Quai d'Orl√©ans, \\"≈ªycie Literackie\\", 2 IV 1989 r., nr 13 (1932), s. 4. Towards the end of the 19th century, the activities of the Literary Society had declined, and the maintenance of the library in Paris was transferred in 1893 to the responsibility of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Krak√≥w.Zaleski (b). in 1926, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Mickiewicz (son of Adam) bequeathed his important collection of manuscripts to the library. In the following period, a number of valuable books, manuscripts and artworks which the library could not properly maintain were sent to museums and institutions in the now independent Poland. World War II Franciszek Jan Pu≈Çaski, Director of the Polish Library, 1928-1956 On the eve of World War II there were 145,000 books, 1,000 manuscripts, 12,000 images, 2,800 atlases and maps and 20,000 copies of documents relating to Polish history drawn from British and French archives. Although German occupying forces seized the library's collection during World War II, the Library was able to resume work with the liberation of Paris.Zaleski (c). Most of the looted materials were returned from Germany by 1947, however, the Library faced bitter legal battles with the post-war Communist Polish government over ownership.Nowacki, K. \\"The Polish libraries in Paris and London\\", Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, Sage, April 1983 15: 87-104. These were eventually resolved in the Library's favour in 1959.Zaleski (d). Following Poland's return to democracy in 1989, links were reestablished with the new Polish government.Zaleski (e). Current dilemmas Chopin in 1836, by his fianc√©e M. Wodzi≈Ñska Quai d'Orl√©ans (the first building on the right houses the Polish Library) The Polish Library in Paris is the oldest cultural institution outside the territory of Poland. Since 1854 the Library has occupied the entire original building. Next to the Library are the premises of the Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Paris, opened in 1903. Attached, are also the Salon Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, the only permanent exhibition in Paris to the memory of the composer and the Mus√©e Boleslas Biegas with paintings and sculpture by the artist and other Polish artists. In 1989 the collection had grown to 220,000 volumes, around 5,000 Polish maps, 7,000 16th - 20th century images, plus the collections of the Towarzystwo Historyczno-Literackie w Pary≈ºu. Although in 1893 the Library came under the predecessor of the Polish Academy of Learning in Krak√≥w, at that time in partitioned Poland, this did not resolve its relationship with the Library's neighbour and founding institution in Paris, the Historical and Literary Society, (Fr.: Soci√©t√© Historique et Litt√©raire Polonaise -SHLP). Not until 2004, after a process of arbitration, was it formally agreed that the Library is jointly \\"owned\\" by both organisations, through the mechanism of the Association de la Biblioth√®que Polonaise de Paris, in effect a governing council, composed of seven delegates from each of the two \\"parent\\" institutions. Typically, these are people with distinguished academic credentials from France or Poland. The chairman of the association, or governing council of the Library, is elected for a term of 5 years and is currently C. Pierre Zaleski, from the Polish Academy of Learning. He is also the chief executive of the Library and heads a professional management team for its day-to-day running. The Library and its part-owner, the Historical and Literary Society, are jointly members of the Standing Conference of [Polish] Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West[ern hemisphere].Website of the Standing Conference of Polish Museums, Archives and Libraries This body groups all recognised collections outside Poland, but it does not cover items held in foreign institutions, nor the many thousands of objects as yet unrecovered from war-time looting and displacement. In the present economic decline, although partly funded from Poland's higher education budget, the Library faces continuous challenges as maintenance costs rise, materials age and cultural institutions face financial competition from other social priorities and needs, not least digital ones. There is currently pressure on the Polish collection at Rapperswil Castle to leave its premises in Switzerland. This bodes ill for other such centres which may be obliged either to be scattered or receive more fragile materials, as has already disastrously happened in the case of the decimated Polish Museum at Fawley Court, England.

Sissy stalls Captain Butler who says that his dreams \\"went with the wind\\", to which Sissy asks \\"What wind?\\" and the theme music starts again. Sissy then says, \\"That's real pretty but that don't answer my question\\". Starlet then descends the staircase in her handmade dress, complete with curtain rod, and Ratt professes his love by saying \\"That gown is gorgeous\\", to which Starlet replies \\"Thank you, I saw it in the window and I just couldn't resist it\\". The Yankee soldier comes to, marries Ratt and Starlet, and she gives the soldier the money for the back taxes. After an altercation and finding out that Starlet is in love with Brashly, Melody dies, but only after she pushes Starlet down the stairs. Brashly leaves. Then Ratt leaves and Starlet slams the door in his face as he is about to deliver the famous line of the original film. Finally, Starlet complains to Sissy, \\"What am I gonna do?\\", whereas Sissy then slaps her and states \\"Frankly, Miss Starlet, I don‚Äôt give a damn\\". Cultural references The sketch made various cultural references including Bobbie Gentry's \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\", Tony Orlando and Dawn's \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\", \\"Dixie\\", \\"Camptown Races\\", Chicken of the Sea \\" A Streetcar Named Desire\\", and tuna casserole. Curtain dress The curtain dress worn by Burnett The curtain dress was conceptualized and designed by The Carol Burnett Show costumer Bob Mackie. The script originally called for the dress to be hanging off Burnett, but Mackie did not find it funny. He asked the art director for a real curtain rod and green fabric and made the dress on a mannequin. Burnett said that she came into costume fittings and when she saw the curtain rod she said it was the most brilliant sight gag ever. A popular misconception gives Bob Mackie sole credit for the iconic drape dress. Sketch co-writers Rick Hawkins and Liz Sage had the original idea for the dress to include the curtain rods. They took the idea to the brilliant Bob Mackie,and he constructed the dress we all know and love.Sketch co-writer Liz Sage Earlier Parodies Exactly nine years earlier to the day, November 13, 1967, The Carol Burnett Show aired a different spoof entitled \\"Gone With the Breeze.\\" In that sketch, Burnett's character was named \\"Scarlett O'Fever.\\" Guest star Richard Chamberlain played \\"Ratt Butler,\\" and Korman appeared as \\"Uncle Ben.\\" On another occasion, when the show was doing a tribute to the films of MGM, a quickie based on Gone With the Wind was performed by Vicki Lawrence as Scarlett and Lyle Waggoner as Rhett. Legacy The curtain dress scene was named #2 in TV Guides January 23‚Äì29, 1999 list of \\"The 50 Funniest TV Moments of All Time\\". The laughter when Burnett came down the staircase was too long‚Äîindeed, it was the longest-length laugh during the entire ten-year series of the program‚Äîand it had to be edited. The entire outfit, with curtain rod, is on display at the Smithsonian Institution. In addition to this, Mattel released a character doll of Burnett as Starlet under the Barbie Celebrity Doll line in 2009. The sketch inspired a challenge in the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race, named \\"Gone with the Window,\\" in which the contestants had to make dresses from curtains.

Fossils have been found from the Santa Maria Supersequence of the late Carnian and early Norian stages, making Polesinesuchus one of the oldest aetosaurs. It contains a single species, Polesinesuchus aurelioi, the fifth aetosaur species known from South America to date.  Discovery  Polesinesuchus was first named by L√∫cio Roberto-da- Silva, Julia B. Desojo, S√©rgio F. Cabreira, Alex S. S. Aires, Rodrigo T. M√ºller, Cristian P. Pacheco and S√©rgio Dias-da-Silva in 2014 and the type species is Polesinesuchus aurelioi. It is known solely from its holotype specimen, a partially articulated partial skeleton. It is composed of the parietal bone and the braincase as well as postcranial elements including cervical, dorsal, sacral and caudal vertebrae, both scapulae, a humerus, the ilium, pubis, ischium and tibia, a partial right pes, and anterior and mid- dorsal paramedian osteoderms. It was collected from the Santa Maria Formation which dates back to the late Carnian and earliest Norian stages of the Late Triassic.  Description  Polesinesuchus is known from a relatively small- sized individual, probably a juvenile based on the incomplete fusion of neural arches to their centra in the whole vertebral column. Polesinesuchus can be distinguished from all other aetosaurs by a unique combination of characters not controlled by ontogeny, most of which are found in its vertebrae. Its cervical vertebrae show prezygapophyses that widely extend laterally through most of the anterior edge of the diapophyses. In Polesinesuchus, hyposphene articulations are absent in both cervical and mid-dorsal vertebrae. A ventral keel is present in the cervical vertebrae. The centra of the anterior and mid- dorsal vertebrae lack a lateral fossa. The proximal end of the scapula is greatly expanded, while the medial portion of scapular blade is expanded anteroposteriorly. Polesinesuchus possess a short humerus with a robust shaft, and a dorsoventral and very low iliac blade with a long anterior process, exceeding slightly the pubic peduncle.  Classification  A phylogenetic analysis was conducted in the first description of Polesinesuchus based on a slightly updated data matrix from previous analyses, resulting in a matrix that includes 19 aetosaurs and two outgroup taxa which are scored based on 37 morphological traits. Polesinesuchus was recovered as the sister taxon of Aetobarbakinoides, known from the same geological formation. Close relatives of this clade included Aetosauroides and Neoaetosauroides, both of which are also from South America. However, Aetosaurinae is found to be paraphyletic representing a grade of early aetosaurs that developed into desmatosuchines and typothoracisines later in the Triassic. Although this clade is placed in a relatively basal phylogenetic position among stagonolepidid aetosaurs, it is closely related to both desmatosuchines and typothoracisines, two derived clades of stagonolepidids. Below is a cladogram modified from this analysis.

Articles of Cherukad Govinda Pisharody. The novel describes the social and cultural backgrounds of Malayalis from the period from 1930 to 1950. It explains about the life of teachers, the harassments they had to face by the managers, it describes the unjust actions and orders the managers forcefully imposed on their dependent teachers. The story uses the colloquial language which was used by the people in the villages so that the novel is presented in a natural way. The narration is made by the heroine Nani, she is a bold and a very strong character in the story. The novel is explained as Nani's point of view. Still, the title is dedicated for her grandmother. Nani's grandmother is yet another powerful character in the story. She represents a typical old generation woman, strictly holding ethics and certain orthodox conventions. But Nani struggles with her grandmother for moving on with the pace of the contemporary society, the situation symbolically illustrates the struggle made by the new generation ideas with the old generation concepts and finally the conventional concepts being replaced by the most modern ideas. Nani is an educated woman who worked as a teacher. She worked in the teachers' union and made many developments in the field of education. However, some political issues made her jobless. She was attracted towards the socialist ideas which were spreading fast in many places of India at the time of independence. The main reason for her dismissal was her strong belief on socialist ideas and because of the support she offered for the Communist Party. Her brother, husband and many dearer and nearer peoples worked hard for promoting socialistic ideas and were sent to jail. Gradually, her grandmother was also interested in such democratic concepts and she finally accepted that socialism is the best way to implement the righteousness and social equality of all class of people. Grandma firmly believed in communism and in a particular point of the story, she was even sent to jail. But the extraordinary boldness of the heroine made her strong enough to endure all such hardships. The story happened at the time when the social conditions were really worse, even caste system existed in the society at that time. The life of common people at that period was very clearly depicted by the novelist in the story. It explains about the vivid life of people in Kerala at the time of independence and the subsequent events that followed after obtaining independence. In this way, Cherukad always tried to picturise the stories of common people. His simplicity in presentation and innocent narration always attracted the readers. His autobiography Jeevithapaatha (1974) received the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1975 and Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977.\\"Cherukad won the sahithya Academy Awards for his contribution\\".

February 2 bombings During the February second bombings there was from 90 to 100 people inside the Picture House movie theatre who were watching Ziddi Pakhtun at Qissa Khawani Bazaar. The attackers threw two grenades after the movie was paused while still sitting in the back of the cinema. The grenades killed five which was followed by a stampede during which 31 were injured. The wounded were transported to Lady Reading Hospital where two of them died. February 11 bombings The February 11 explosion happened during the Pashto language film called Yarana at Shama Cinema. According to Ejaz Ahmed, the Capital City Police Officer, the cinema contained 80 people (50 under other sources) and that three grenades were used by the attackers. After the blasts there was blood on caps and shoes as well as human remains scattered around. It was followed by a stampede soon after, which caused majority of injuries. The injured were taken to the Lady Reading Hospital. No group have claimed responsibility but the cinema received warnings prior to the attacks. It was believed that the attack happened because the theatre used to show pornographic films. The blasts were later condemned by Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf chairman Imran Khan and mentioned that it will hinder peace talks as well. Some hours later, the attack was also condemned by the Pakistani President Mamnoon Hussain, as well as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussain.

A leg mechanism (walking mechanism) is a mechanical system designed to provide a propulsive force by intermittent frictional contact with the ground. This is in contrast with wheels or continuous tracks which are intended to maintain continuous frictional contact with the ground. Mechanical legs are linkages that can have one or more actuators, and can perform simple planar or complex motion. Compared to a wheel, a leg mechanism is potentially better fitted to uneven terrain, as it can step over obstacles.. An early design for a leg mechanism called the Plantigrade Machine by Pafnuty Chebyshev was shown at the Exposition Universelle (1878). The original engravings for this leg mechanism are available. The design of the leg mechanism for the Ohio State Adaptive Suspension Vehicle (ASV) is presented in the 1988 book Machines that Walk. In 1996, W-B. Shieh presented a design methodology for leg mechanisms. The artwork of Theo Jansen, see Jansen's linkage, has been particularly inspiring for the design of leg mechanisms, as well as the Klann patent, which is the basis for the leg mechanism of the Mondo Spider.  Design goals  * horizontal speed as constant as possible while touching the ground (support phase) Alt URL * while the foot is not touching the ground, it should move as fast as possible * constant torque/force input (or at least no extreme spikes/changes) * stride height (enough for clearance, not too much to conserve energy) * the foot has to touch the ground for at least half of the cycle for a two/four leg mechanism or respectively, a third of the cycle for a three/six leg mechanism * minimized moving mass * vertical center of mass always inside the base of support * the speed of each leg or group of legs should be separately controllable for steering * the leg mechanism should allow forward and backward walking Another design goal can be, that stride height and length etc. can be controlled by the operator. This can relatively easily be achieved with a hydraulic leg mechanism, but is not practicable with a crank-based leg mechanism. The optimization has to be done for the whole vehicle ‚Äì ideally the force/torque variation during a rotation should cancel each other out.  History  Richard Lovell Edgeworth tried in 1770 to construct a machine he called a \\"Wooden Horse\\", but was not successful. Patents Patents for leg mechanism designs range from rotating cranks to four-bar and six-bar linkages. See for example the following patents: * U.S. Patent No. 469,169 Figure Toy, F. O. Norton (1892). * U.S. Patent No. 1,146,700, Animated Toy, A. Gund (1915). A leg mechanism formed by an inverted slider-crank. * U.S. Patent No. 1,363,460, Walking Toy, J. A. Ekelund (1920). A leg mechanism formed by a rotating crank with extensions that contact the ground. * U.S. Patent No. 1,576,956, Quadruped Walking Mechanism, E. Dunshee (1926). A four-bar leg mechanism that shows the coupler curve forms the foot trajectory. * U.S. Patent No. 1,803,197, Walking Toy, P. C. Marie (1931). Another rotating crank leg mechanism. * U.S. Patent No. 1,819,029, Mechanical Toy Horse, J. St. C. King (1931).

Merritt and Hannes Bok. Merritt had completed the first seven chapters, roughly 20,000 words, before his death in 1943. Bok wrote the remainder of the novel, twenty chapters of more than 60,000 words, working from \\"a sketchy plot outline\\" left by Merritt. The story concerns the discovery of a centuries-old shipwreck, complete with the preserved bodies of its crew, and the consequences for the passengers and crew of the cruise ship that comes across it.Sam Moskowitz, \\"Fantasy Book Reviews\\", Fantastic Novels, January 1949, p.113. Publication history The Black Wheel was originally published in 1947, by the specialty publisher New Collectors Group, in a stated hardcover edition of 1000 copies (although more were reportedly printed). According to Robert Weinberg: \\"The New Collectors Group was the joint effort of Paul Dennis O'Connor, Stanley Mullen and Martin Greenberg (not to be confused with Martin H. Greenberg). Their first two hardcovers were The Fox Woman and Blue Pagoda and The Black Wheel, both by A. Merritt and Hannes Bok. Bok was a science fiction artist and a lifelong fan of Merritt's work. The two books were short novels begun but never finished by Merritt. Bok finished both novels and provided the illustrations for the books as well. Both books did reasonably well considering that neither story was very good. The company broke up early in 1948 when the other partners grew disillusioned with O'Connor's business practices. Greenberg withdrew from the press and with another fan, David Kyle, formed Gnome Press.\\" Robert Weinberg, Science Fiction Specialty Publishers in Hall, Hal W. (ed) Science Fiction Collections: Fantasy, Supernatural and Weird Tales. Haworth Press, 1983, p. 123 In 1976, The Black Wheel was included in an omnibus collection of Merritt-Bok collaborations issued by Arno Press. A mass market paperback was released by Avon Books in 1981.ISFDB bibliography Reception Sam Moskowitz, reviewing the original edition, noted that the Merritt sections were unlike most of his other work, particularly since \\"The introduction of characters and the initial build-up is almost leisurely,\\" concluding that \\"Bok has done a commendable job of completing the novel.\\" E. F. Bleiler, however, found Bok's effort \\"not a very good job\\" (although he praised Bok's illustrations).E. F. Bleiler, The Guide to Supernatural Fiction, Kent State University Press, 1983 (p.362). Thrilling Wonder Stories reviewed the novel tepidly, describing it as \\"an entertaining oddity\\" even though the characters were undeveloped, the supernatural events too numerous and too repetitive, and the story \\"so fantastic that it stretches credibility close to the snapping point\\".\\"Science Fiction Book Review, Thrilling Wonder Stories, December 1948, pp.176-77. Baird Searles, reviewing the 1981 reissue, declared the novel \\"years ahead of its time\\", although noting that some aspects of the writing had dated badly. and concluded that Bok had captured \\"the dreamlike -- or nightmarish -- quality that Merritt often achieved, though he never attains the extravagant, baroque splendor of Merritt at his best\\".\\"On Books\\", Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, February 15, 1982, p.19-20 References Category:1947 American novels Category:1947 fantasy novels ","title":"The Black Wheel"},{"id":"41910888","text":"Odontotrochus chlorostomus is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails Marshall, B.

Several dozen poems of this genre were written over the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This name of this genre, meaning ‚Äúyour God‚Äù, comes from the closing word of Numbers 15:41: ‚Äú...to be your God; I am the Lord your God.‚Äù A quote from the end of this verse appears in the Qedusha liturgy of Musaf in most Jewish prayer rites, including the Ashkenazic Rite. The poets of Medieval Western Ashkenaz composed the Elohekhem piyyutim to be inserted in the liturgy immediately after this Biblical quote. These poems all begin with the word ‚ÄúElohekhem‚Äù, thus creating an anadiplosis with the last word of the Biblical quote. The Elohekhem genre is miniaturistic; the poems average a length of six to seven lines (though some are as short as four, and some as long as eighteen).Ezra Fleischer, Hebrew Liturgical Poetry in the Middle Ages (Hebrew: Shirat Ha-qodesh Ha-‚Äòivrit Bim√© Ha-benayim), Keter Publishing House: Jerusalem, 1975. Pp. 448-9. Of the several dozen piyyutim of this genre that were written in the Middle Ages, eight of them survived into the printed Western Ashkenazic rite, and most or all of them are still recited in synagogues of that rite even today. These are: \\"Elohekhem Shofe·π≠ ·∫íedeq\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊©◊ï◊§◊ò ◊¶◊ì◊ß), for Shabbat Shuva; \\"Elohekhem Yashiv Be-shalem\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊ô◊©◊ô◊ë ◊ë◊©◊ú◊ù), for the Sabbath in the middle of Sukkoth; \\"Elohekhem Yazria·∏• Shimsho\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊ô◊ñ◊®◊ô◊ó ◊©◊û◊©◊ï), for a Sabbath that falls on Rosh ·∏§odesh; \\"Elohekhem Yaskil \`Avdo\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊ô◊©◊õ◊ô◊ú ◊¢◊ë◊ì◊ï), for Shabbat Bereshit (the Sabbath on which the annual reading of the Torah is begun, with the Torah- portion Bereshit); \\"Elohekhem Yishla·∏• Meshi·∏•o\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊ô◊ñ◊®◊ó ◊û◊©◊ô◊ó◊ï), for the Sabbath that falls during Hanukkah; \\"Elohekhem Yosif Yado\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊ô◊ï◊°◊ô◊£ ◊ô◊ì◊ï), for Shabbat Na·∏•amu; \\"Elohekhem Shikhno Sam\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊©◊õ◊†◊ï ◊©◊ù), for the Sabbath on which a wedding is being celebrated in the community; and \\"Elohekhem Ani Zokher Ha-berit\\" (◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊õ◊ù ◊ê◊†◊ô ◊ñ◊ï◊õ◊® ◊î◊ë◊®◊ô◊™), for the Sabbath on which a berit mila, circumcision, is performed.Seligmann B√§r, ed., Seder \`Avodat Yisra‚Äôel (◊°◊ì◊® ◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú), R√∂delheim, 1868, pp. 243-4.

A prostitute from at least 1652, she was a procurer and the madam of a brothel from 1665 onward. Life She was one of at last seven children born to the soldier Jehan de la Motte and Elisabeth Habert. Because of the poverty and many children of her parents, she was forced to move to Amsterdam to support herself at an early age. She married Robbert Joris Toonszoon (1629-ca 1652) in 1651, Meijndert Pieterszoon (1627-?) in 1653, and finally NN van Beeck. Not much is known of her spouses, however. She is confirmed as a prostitute in 1652, when she was warned by the authorities that she would be imprisoned if she should be arrested for prostitution again. During the 1650s, she also worked as an artist model. She is known as the model for at least two paintings of Dirck Bleker. In 1659, she was arrested for involvement in a knife fight, but the outcome is unknown. In 1665, she was arrested for having hosted prostitutes and their clients in her home; that is, for keeping a brothel. She was fined and exiled from the city for two years. In 1673 and 1683 she was again arrested for keeping a brothel. In 1680 she was apparently a madam of some repute. She was given light sentences and is not mentioned in any documents after 1683.

Unlike traditional versions of poker, 3's, 4's and 9's hold special value because of their significance in the sport of baseball - three strikes, three outs, four balls, and nine innings. Rules Play proceeds as follows (\\"player\\" refers only to those who have not folded and are still in the game), with betting rounds in-between. Betting is clockwise, the player with the lowest card showing starts. The action is dealt as follows: * Two cards dealt face down to each player. * one card dealt face up (up card) to each player (Third Street). * upcard to each player (Fourth Street). * upcard to each player (Fifth Street). * upcard to each player (Sixth Street). * downcard to each player (Seventh Street). * showdown. All 3's and 9's are wild cards, meaning a player dealt them can attribute any value they want to them. For example, if they needed a Jack to complete a straight, a 3 or a 9 would count as a Jack. If a player is dealt a 4 face up, they immediately are dealt an additional card face up (And if they are dealt another 4, once again they get another card). This means that some players potentially will have more cards (some of them possibly wild cards) than their opponents, which is a big advantage. Because of the added value of 3's, 4's and 9's, the highest possible hand is Five of a Kind, which is not normally possible in traditional poker games, and it beats a straight flush. Variations There are several variations of Baseball Poker. One pot limit version of the game states that any player who is dealt a 3 face-up must immediately either bet the size of the pot or fold their hand right away. Other games only require a fixed payment rather than the whole pot as an alternative to folding. Another version of the game also makes face down 4's entitled to an additional card. There are variations as to when the player must announce they have a face down 4, and also whether the additional card should also be face down as a result. Still another variation on the face-down 4's requires the player to \\"buy\\" the additional card by putting an additional sum into the pot (often a multiple of the minimum bet). In this case, if the player declines to make the additional bet, they do not have to fold, but they do not get the additional card. Football is an alternative version of Baseball Poker where 3's and 6's are wild and an additional card is drawn if a player is dealt a 2. Woolworth is another variant, this time with 5's and 10's being wild, with an additional card awarded for players dealt a 2. Blind Baseball is played the same as Baseball Poker, but with nine cards in total instead of seven.

History Triathlon came to Australia in the early 1980s but the first state Associations arrived 4 year later. In 1986, the Triathlon Federation of Australia (what is now known as Triathlon Australia) was founded with the support of Dr. Jim Hazel from Sydney and Geoff Frost from Melbourne. In 1991, the name was changed to what is now known as Triathlon Australia. In 1989, the first International Triathlon Union's Triathlon World Championships was (or ITU for short) held there in Australia. The distances for the short course triathlon was also selected that year. The distances for the short distance are (1.5 km swim 40 km cycle and 10 km run.) Success *In 1990, just one year after the first World Triathlon Series, Greg Welch (born 1964) had won the Elite Male World Championship for Triathlon in Florida. The race was also called the Grand SlamAustralian Triathlon Honor roll *Just following Greg Welch's success came Miles Stewart's success the following year again in the ITU. He had won gold and just 2 seconds faster than Rick Wells, another Australian Triathlete.1991 ITU Championship *Australia's first women success came again 1 year after in the women race. During the 1992 ITU Triathlon World Championships, Michellie Jones had won gold. She won gold again one year later in 1993.Michellie Jones As of March 2014, Australia is the current leading nation in the sport of Triathlon. The nation currently has 19 senior World Champion Titles.Australia's success AYTC (Australian Youth Triathlon Championships) Despite Triathlon World Championships, there is also a championship for youth from years 13 to 18. To train or compete, they must have a valid membership. Memberships vary from $30(youth) to $500 (professional). The lengths vary for each age group. 13 and 14 years - 400m swim, 12 km bike and 3 km run 15 and 16 years - 600m swim, 16 km bike and 4 km run 17 and 18 years - 750m swim, 20 km bike and 5 km run. The AYTC was created to let junior athletes develop the sport of Triathlon and to set up the best possible pathway to the Olympics and the Triathlon World Championships. ‚ÄúThis event will provide excellent opportunities for our development coaches to identify young athletes with the talent to succeed as our future elite Australian triathletes.‚Äù Ms. Gripper reported.AYTC Events in the AYTC all include a draft legal cycling leg for bicycles. This way, junior athletes can compete under the same rules as the Olympics and Triathlon World Championships.

Equivalently, a G-torsor P on X is a principal homogeneous space for the group scheme G_X = X \\\\times G (i.e., G_X acts simply transitively on P.) The definition may be formulated in the sheaf-theoretic language: a sheaf P on the category of X-schemes with some Grothendieck topology is a G-torsor if there is a covering { U_i \\\\to X } in the topology, called the local trivialization, such that the restriction of P to each U_i is a trivial G_{U_i}-torsor. A line bundle is nothing but a \\\\mathbb{G}_m-bundle, and, like a line bundle, the two points of views of torsors, geometric and sheaf- theoretic, are used interchangeably (by permitting P to be a stack like an algebraic space if necessary). It is common to consider a torsor for not just a group scheme but more generally for a group sheaf (e.g., fppf group sheaf).  Examples and basic properties  Examples * A \\\\operatorname{GL}_n-torsor on X is a principal \\\\operatorname{GL}_n-bundle on X. *If L/K is a finite Galois extension, then \\\\operatorname{Spec} L \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} K is a \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)-torsor (roughly because the Galois group acts simply transitively on the roots.) This fact is a basis for Galois descent. See integral extension for a generalization. Remark: A G-torsor P over X is isomorphic to a trivial torsor if and only if P(X) = \\\\operatorname{Mor}(X, P) is nonempty. (Proof: if there is an s: X \\\\to P, then X \\\\times G \\\\to P, (x, g) \\\\mapsto s(x)g is an isomorphism.) Let P be a G-torsor with a local trivialization { U_i \\\\to X } in √©tale topology. A trivial torsor admits a section: thus, there are elements s_i \\\\in P(U_i). Fixing such sections s_i, we can write uniquely s_i g_{ij} = s_j on U_{ij} with g_{ij} \\\\in G(U_{ij}). Different choices of s_i amount to 1-coboundaries in cohomology; that is, the g_{ij} define a cohomology class in the sheaf cohomology (more precisely ƒåech cohomology with sheaf coefficient) group H^1(X, G). A trivial torsor corresponds to the identity element. Conversely, it is easy to see any class in H^1(X, G) defines a G-torsor on X, unique up to an isomorphism. If G is a connected algebraic group over a finite field \\\\mathbf{F}_q, then any G-bundle over \\\\operatorname{Spec} \\\\mathbf{F}_q is trivial. (Lang's theorem.)  Reduction of a structure group  Most of constructions and terminology regarding principal bundles in algebraic topology carry over in verbatim to G-bundles. For example, if P \\\\to X is a G-bundle and G acts from the left on a scheme F, then one can form the associated bundle P \\\\times^{G} F \\\\to X with fiber F. In particular, if H is a closed subgroup of G, then for any H-bundle P, P \\\\times^H G is a G-bundle called the induced bundle. If P is a G-bundle that is isomorphic to the induced bundle P' \\\\times^H G for some H-bundle P', then P is said to admit a reduction of structure group from G to H. Let X be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field k, G a semisimple algebraic group and P a G-bundle on a relative curve X_R = X \\\\times_{\\\\operatorname{Spec}k} \\\\operatorname{Spec}R, R a finitely generated k-algebra. Then a theorem of Drinfeld and Simpson states that, if G is simply connected and split, there is an √©tale morphism R \\\\to R' such that P \\\\times_{X_R} X_{R'} admits a reduction of structure group to a Borel subgroup of G.http://www.math.harvard.edu/~gaitsgde/grad_2009/SeminarNotes/Oct27(Higgs).pdfhttp://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/282ynotes/LectureXIV- Borel.pdf  Invariants  If P is a parabolic subgroup of a smooth affine group scheme G with connected fibers, then its degree of instability, denoted by \\\\operatorname{deg}_i(P), is the degree of its Lie algebra \\\\operatorname{Lie}(P) as a vector bundle on X. The degree of instability of G is then \\\\operatorname{deg}_i(G) = \\\\max { \\\\operatorname{deg}_i(P)  P \\\\subset G \\\\text{ parabolic subgroups} }. If G is an algebraic group and E is a G-torsor, then the degree of instability of E is the degree of the inner form {}^E G = \\\\operatorname{Aut}_G(E) of G induced by E (which is a group scheme over X); i.e., \\\\operatorname{deg}_i (E) = \\\\operatorname{deg}_i ({}^E G). E is said to be semi-stable if \\\\operatorname{deg}_i (E) \\\\le 0 and is stable if \\\\operatorname{deg}_i (E) < 0.

She was murdered by her former fianc√©, the doctor and former ship's surgeon Johannes van Goch, who could not accept that she had terminated their engagement. The case became a subject of public debate and was frequently mentioned in literature as a moral example. Bibliography Anna Smitshuizen was the fourth child of German parents. Her father, wig maker Gerrit Smitshuizen, had been born in Xanten, and her mother, Jannetje Kluijt, was born in Meurs. Anna was born in February 1751 and baptised in the Reform Church of Alkmaar on 28 March that year. Whilst living in Alkmaar, she may have been acquainted with author Nicolaas Hoefnagel, who lived in the town for a time and Smitshuizen featured in his writings. When Smitshuizen was about 19 she left Alkmaar and travelled to Amsterdam, where she became a prostitute. In 1774 she was working in the brothel of Geertruid van Kesteren (aka Zwarte Trui) on Oudezijds Achterburgwal, part of Amsterdam's De Wallen red-light district. The brothel women's medical needs were attended by an ex-ship's doctor, Johannes Bartholomeus Ferdinandus van Goch. Smitshuizen started to have an affair with the doctor. Murder Smitshuizen became engaged to van Goch. On 25 May 1775 they travelled to Ouderkerk to inform van Goch's mother. A week later, on 2 June, Smitshuizen broke off the engagement. She had begun to have doubts about van Goch as the city was talking about him following leaflets written by Hoefnagel discrediting van Goch. Van Goch took the news badly. He threatened to kill himself and sent Smitshuizen a love letter written in his blood. Around 9pm on 29 June 1775 van Goch visited Smitshuizen and pleaded with her in front of her housemates. She told him it was all over and asked him to leave. He refused and around 10.30 the other women tried to get him to leave, but he stabbed Smitshuizen killing her. He claimed that he had tried to commit suicide and that Smitshuizen was accidentally stabbed trying to stop him. His version of events was not believed, and he was sentenced to death on 16 January 1776. However legal challenges delayed the execution until April 1778. A scaffold was erected in front of the Town Hall and a large crowd gathered in Dam Square to see van Goch executed on the 4 April. War of words In late 1777 Nicolaas Hoefnagel published Merkwaardige en zonderlinge levensgevallen van Anna Smitshuizen, gewezene minnares van den thans gevangen zittende JBF van Gog, vervat in samenspraken (Strange and strange lives of Anna Smitshuizen, former mistress of the currently imprisoned JBF van Gog, contained in discussions). In it he portrayed Smitshuizen as being an innocent soul and victim of a godless killer. The book was also directed against fellow author Willem Ockers, an atheist and former employer of van Goch. Ockers responded with Waarachtig bericht, meerendeels getrokken uit echte brieven en geschriften van den thans op de Gevangen-Poort geconfineerde J.B.F. van Goch. Aan zyn famielje en goede vrienden geschreven, zynde een zaakelyk verhaal, van al't rampzalige dat ... is voorgevallen; benevens een waarachtige beschrijving van ... Anna Smitshuizen (True message, mostly drawn from real letters and writings of the JBF van Goch, who is currently reconstructed at the Prison Gate. Written to his family and close friends, a business-like story, of all the disastrous that ... has happened; in addition to a true description of ... Anna Smitshuizen).

They are known as 'Mullas' and are descendants of Mir Mulla Shehsawar, who they claim to have migrated from Iran Sarbaz in 1513AD. The Mullazai tribe numbers in Panjgur are about 200 families or about 5000 persons. Other tribes associated with the Mullazai settled in Panjgur, Mastung, Sorab, Kalat, Kharan, Quetta, Kucklak, Nushki, Dalbandin, Qandahar and Iran.Wolfgang Weissleder, The Nomadic Alternative (Cambridge, Mouton Press: 1978), 250.  Etymology  Mullazai in Balochi means descendants of mollas who was a religious man. Location Tasp is largest of the Panjgur townships and has a Mullazai population numbering around 600 families. Other places where the tribe have settled include Khubadan and Kallag. There, the tribe mainly work cultivating dates, amiraris. The date groves extend in places to nearly mile away from the river. Southwest of Tasp is Sorowan and has the Khushkawa, where some of the tribe still live. History The first Mosque Of Panjgur Built In 1513 By Mulla Shahsawar Mullazai The first mosque in Panjgur was built in 1513 in Tasp By Mulla Shehsawar, an ancestor of the tribe. The Mullazai are known as Akhoonds, Mala Zai, Mali Zai or Mollazahis Clans of the tribe include Kenagzai, Halazai, Sahibzada, Miazai, Gowarazai and Akundzai . These are the direct descendants of the tribe who left Iran and settled in Pakistan. In northern Sarbaz County it consisted of 16 clans. They included Askani, Bugani, Dagarani, Gazakandi, Gohramzai, Kahmaki, Kiazai, kolagi, Miranzai, Mollahzehi, Nohani, Khwajikhel, Perozai, Rind, Shahalzai, Shahozai, and Mahair.

Also, many of the inhabitants work in the local schools and hospitals as well as travel to work in the Royal Army of Oman. Mullazai are known for the connections with the Kalat State before 1947. The annexation of Balochistan into Pakistan resulted in a turmoil in this region of Balochistan which largely affected the Mullazai tribe and its political grip, but with little impact on the socio-economic activities of the people. Agriculture is dependent on the significant local rainfall and from tube wells. Many people from Tasp also work as contractors in Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Education There are institutions that range from primary to high school level. There is one High School for boys and one for girls. Every year those students who pass their examinations and continue on to higher education have to do so outside the Panjgur District. A late landlord Mir Haji Ghulam Jan Mullazai from kallag hoped to promote education in the area and donated property for the use of a high school for girls and for a primary school.

Discovery Apollo of Gaza The statue was claimed to have been recovered from the sea in August 2013 by Joudat Ghrab, a local Palestinian fisherman. Ghrab said that he saw the statue lying in shallow waters near the Gaza border with Egypt, and initially thought the statue was a badly burnt body. It took four hours to get the statue ashore. The statue was later put for sale on the internet auction site eBay for $500,000 by members of Ghrab's family. The sale price is believed to be significantly below its true value. Police appointed by Hamas, the rulers of the Gaza Strip, subsequently seized the statue and are investigating its provenance. Design The statue has not been examined by archaeologists, but a Reuters report published in The Guardian attests to \\"a few blurred photographs of the intact deity, who is laid out incongruously on a blanket emblazoned with Smurfs\\". The evidence dates the statue to between the 5th century BC and the 1st century BC. The statue depicts Apollo with curly hair and one eye possibly inlaid with a blue stone iris, standing upright with an outstretched arm, and with his palm held up. Historians have suggested that the statue was found on land rather than at sea owing to its apparent good preservation, without signs of metal disfigurement or barnacles. Noting the green patina, Gaza archaeologist Fadel al-Utol said: \\"If it had spent time underwater, the bronze would be blackened.\\" The obscure location of the statue's discovery could be used to avoid ownership arguments.

He has also been involved in theater. His work has been recognized with various awards over his career. Life Villena Hern√°ndez was born in Mexico City to parents who taught him to respect Mexican traditions and encouraged his interest in them. He began creating his own Day of the Dead altars when he was ten in the family garage. He studied history at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, then moved to the city of Puebla when he was twenty three, where he still lives. Cartoner√≠a career View of Villena Hern√°ndez's workshop in Puebla Close up of piece in progress Finished skeletal nun piece He began his artisan career in 1990, after taking classes in cartoner√≠a, with a break for a year in 1996 when he went to New York to earn money selling chicharrones. Since then, he has been dedicated to cartoner√≠a full-time. His workshop is just outside the city of Puebla on the old highway linking this city to that of Tlaxcala, an old industrial corridor. The exterior in non- descript, distinguished only by his name on the door. Inside, there are two rooms filled with creations in various stages of completion as well as walls covered in various recognitions. Villena Hern√°ndez makes most of the traditional cartoner√≠a objects such as pi√±atas, Lupita dolls, Judas figures, but he has become known for monumental works commissioned by government and cultural institutions in Puebla and Mexico City related to Holy Week, Christmas, Corpus Christi and Day of the Dead. Of these, his altars related to Day of the Dead are of particular note, especially the skeletal figures that adorn them. He has created altars in honor of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza (2009) for the Puebla city hall, the Mexican Revolution for the Complejo Cultural Universitaria of the Benem√©rita Universidad Aut√≥noma de Puebla (2010), the China Poblana with various students for the Puebla city hall (2012) and one for Jos√© Guadalupe Posada for the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago (2013) . The artisan represents death as something happy, fun and irreverent, with the skeletal figures in movement. His works also show influence from Jos√© Guadalupe Posada in their sense of irony. His work has been exhibited in various locations in Mexico as well as New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Madrid, which included an invitation to the National Museum of Mexican Art for a month. His work can be found in public and private collections including that of Richard Harris‚Äô collection of death memorabilia and at the Casa de Venados in M√©rida, Yucat√°n. However, he says that his work is better appreciated outside of Mexico, with few in the country willing to pay what the creations are worth. He also finds it difficult to get government and non- governmental support to exhibit outside the country. To supplement his income from sales, he also gives classes as rents pieces for showings. Villena Hern√°ndez‚Äôs cartoner√≠a work has won awards and recognitions in Puebla, other parts of Mexico and the United States. In 2001, he won first place at the Premio de Arte Popular of FONART, for a 3.4 meter train boarded by skeletal figures depicting the Mexico Revolution, which took six months and seven kilos of paper to make. He was named one of the 475 distinguished citizens of the state of Puebla. In 2013, he was named a ‚Äúmaster of popular art‚Äù (maestro de arte popular) by the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. He has also been interviewed for radio, television and newspapers for his work related to culture. Theatrical career In addition to his cartoner√≠a, Villena Hern√°ndez has also been involved with the theatre, directing and producing plays with his own company (Compa√±ia Teatral de Rodolfo Villena) .

The Œ¥+ groups include groups with two hydrogen bond donor atoms such as NH2 groups and water molecules. In typical proteins, 7% of amino acid residues belong to niches bound to a Œ¥+ group, while another 7% have the conformation but no single cationic bridging group is detected. Niche3 bound to a water molecule via two O-H...O hydrogen bonds. The red sphere is the oxygen of the water. The mainchain atoms of the niche3 tripeptide are shown as sticks. Oxygen, red; nitrogen, blue; carbon, grey. Hydrogen atoms not shown. Niches are of two kinds, distinguished as niche3 (3 residues, i to i+2) and niche4 (4 residues, i to i+3). In a niche3 motif the Œ¥+-binding carbonyl groups are from residues i and i+2 while in a niche4 motif they are from residues i and i+3. A niche3 has the Œ± conformation for residue i+1 and the Œ≤ conformation for residue i+2; a niche4 has the Œ± conformation for residues i+1 and i+2 and the Œ≤ conformation for residue i+3. A niche occurs commonly at the C-terminus of Œ±-helices, and especially of 310 helices. Metal ions that occur bound to niches in proteins are Na+, K+, Ca++ and Mg++. Proteins with regulatory cations often employ niches for metal binding (thrombin, Na+; annexin, Ca++; pyruvate dehydrogenase, K+). A major cation transporter in cells is calcium ATPase. In the Ca++-bound crystal structures the two calcium ions side-by-side within the transmembrane domain are thought to be at the halfway stage of being transported. As well as being bound by various side chain carbonyl groups, one of these calcium ions is bound by a niche3/niche4 (both in the one motif) at residues 304‚Äì307 at the C-terminus of an Œ±-helix. A lysine side chain in the nuclear export receptor CRM1 is recognised specifically by a niche conformation that has to be adopted as a key part of the nuclear export signal of proteins exiting the nucleus. A sodium ion in the Fluc fluoride channel is situated at the dyad axis of the dimer, bound tetrahedrally by two niche4s, one from each subunit. The Hsp70 interdomain linker region of 10 residues enables allosteric communication between two folded domains. The N-terminal part of the linker has a niche4 structure that is water-bound. In the scorpion toxin BeM9 the side chain of arginine 60 binds the carbonyls of residues 61 and 63 as a niche3. The motif, loss of which alters the specificity of the protein for voltage-gated sodium channels, is named \\"arginine hand\\". The slightly unusual dihedral angles for a niche3 are because this niche3 accommodates two separate NH groups from the arginine's guanidino group. Another small tripeptide motif that binds cations or Œ¥+ groups via main-chain CO groups is called the catgrip.  References  External links  * Motivated Proteins: ; * PDBeMotif: .

Turnbull settled on the lake in 1826 and named his place Linden The home currently located on the site, Linden, was erected in 1914 and was built by P.L. Mann and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (HRHP). Another pre-Civil War mansion, Mount Holly, constructed on the east shore of Lake Washington, is also listed on the NRHP. The Junius Ward home was built at Erwin in 1826 as a log cabin, still standing today and is still owned by the same family. The Law House, an impressive mansion overlooking the lake built in 1902, was ordered as a kit from the Sears & Roebuck Company, and was used in the filming of the 2012 movie Haunted. Roy's Store is located on the north shore of the lake, and is noted for being in business at that location for over 100 years. Pollution Most of the land surrounding Lake Washington is used extensively for agriculture. This has made the lake vulnerable to runoff of fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides. In 1973, the lake was closed to commercial fishing due to contamination, and in 1990, a blue-green algal bloom formed in the lake, which killed 14 dogs that drank from the water. Since then, extensive efforts have been made to reduce the lake's pollution.

The Cortex-A53 is also used in a number of Qualcomm, Samsung, and MediaTek SoCs. Semi-custom derivatives of the Cortex-A53 have been used in Qualcomm's Kryo 250 and Kryo 260 CPUs. The Cortex-A53 is the most widely used architecture for mobile SoCs since 2014 to the present day, making it one of the longest-running ARM processors for mobile devices. It is currently featured in most entry-level and lower mid-range SoCs, while higher-end SoCs used the newer ARM Cortex-A55. The latest SoCs still using the Cortex-A53 are MediaTek Helio G35 and Helio G25, both of which are entry-level SoCs designed for budget smartphones. The processor is used in the ODROID-C2 and in Roku streaming media players (in the high-end models from 2016 and in all models released between 2017-2018).

Instead of a large fan to take energy from the air, it has a flat plate collector. This means the system gains energy from the sun as well as the ambient air. Thermodynamic water heaters use a compressor to transfer the collected heat from the panel to the hot water system using refrigerant fluid that circulates in a closed cycle. Renewable Heat Incentive In the UK, thermodynamic solar panels cannot be used to claim the Renewable Heat Incentive. This is due to the lack of technical standards for the testing and installation.

Tables of recipes as well as other records such as hop schedules and malt bills can be represented using BeerXML for use by brewing software. BeerXML is an open standard and as a subset of Extensible Markup Language (XML). BeerXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. BeerXML is supported by a number of web sites, computer programmes and an increasing number of Android Windows Phone and iOS apps. Plugins and extensions supporting BeerXML have been written for a variety of platforms including Ruby via RubyGems, WordPress, PHP and JavaScript Many brewing hardware manufacturers incorporate BeerXML into their systems and third party plugins and patches are being developed for brewery control hardware and embedded systems allowing the automation and fine control and timing of processes such as mashing and potentially fermentation. Common applications and examples of usage BeerXML is used in both amateur and professional brewing and facilitates the sharing of brewing data over the internet. Users of different applications such as the open-source software Brewtarget (with more than 52,000 downloads ) can share data via XML with users of popular proprietary software such as Beersmith and ORRTIZ: BMS 4 Breweries or upload their data to share on BeerXML compatible sharing sites and cloud platforms such as Brewtoad (over 50,000 registered users ) or the Beersmith Recipe Cloud (with 43,000 registered users). A user of a recipe design and sharing and creation site such as Brewersfriend.com can import and export BeerXML to and from mobile apps or enter it into a brewing competition database such as The Brew Competition Online Entry & Management (BCOE&M;) system. The adoption of BeerXML as a standard is leading to new developments such as ingredients databases which attempt to standardise ingredients definitions and characteristics. Brewers can use platforms like Brewblogger.com to create recipes and log their brewday for publication as a blog and for export to databases and common spreadsheet applications. JavaScript applications such as brauhaus.js (developed from the Malt.io recipe sharing site ) allow users to run them on a local machine or web browser for execution through any standards compliant web browser. Supported fields The following fields form the core information of the BeerXML structure * Recipes Recipe name Brewer Brewing method (All grain, Partial Mash, Extract ) Recipe Type (Ale, Lager, Hybrid, etc.) Recipe volume (Run length) Boil volume (Wort size) Boil time (duration) Recipe efficiency Estimated values OG (Original Gravity) FG (Final Gravity) Color (SRM) Bitterness (IBU) Alcohol content (%abv) * Hops Name Origin Description Alpha acids Beta acids Storageability (HSI) Humulene Caryophyllene Cohumulone Myrcene Farsene (not explicitly included in BeerXML v1) Total oil (not explicitly included in BeerXML v1) Recipe Specific - When added (Boil, Mash, First Wort, Dry, etc.) Amount Time (duration) * Fermentables Name Origin Description Type (Grain, Sugar, etc.) Potential Recommend Mash (true or false) IBU gal/lb (for hopped extract) Color (¬∞Lovibond) Moisture content Protein content Diastatic power (¬∞Lintner) Maximum used (% of grist) Recipe Specific Amount Late Addition (true or false) * Additives (Called MISC for miscellaneous in BeerXML v1) Name Description Type (Fining, Spice, Herb, etc.) Recipe Specific - When added (Boil, Primary, etc.) Amount Time (duration) Yeasts Name Supplier Catalog number Description Type (Ale, Lager, etc.) Form (Dry, Liquid, etc.) Best for Temperature range Flocculation Attenuation Max reuse Recipe Specific Amount Added to secondary (true or false) Time cultured Limitations BeerXML 1.0 supports no more than three fermentation steps. While this is not a real world limitation for many brewers, it does introduce a discrepancy where a software tool or web service that allows several or unlimited fermentation steps wishes to implement BeerXML as an import/export mechanism. For example; where a fermentation schedule instruction to pitch at 21 degrees Celsius, allow to drop to 17 over three days and then decrease by 1 degree per day until the wort reaches 10 degrees, hold for 12 days before racking for maturation. This could not be accommodated within the formal structure requiring the use of informal/optional and non machine readable fields. All units are converted to SI units internally. As a result, there is loss of precision when converting non SI units whether they be Imperial, US Customary or metric. Hop oil contributions in the copper are not explicitly supported in the current definition. Farsene levels are not explicitly supported in the current definition. No distinction is made between weight and mass Development The BeerXML standard has a proposed second version which has been mooted and is under development. It has not been validated or published as its feature set is still under discussion. XML Header As in XML, all files begin with a header line as the first line. After the XML header a record set should start (for example\`‚Ä¶\` or \` ‚Ä¶ \`). Required XML Header Example with Recipes tag: ‚Ä¶ Tag Names Tag names are always uppercase. For example, \\"HOP\\" is acceptable, but \\"hop\\" and Hop\\" are not. Version All records have a required tag that denotes the version of the XML standard. At present, all are set to the integer 1 for this version of the standard. It is intended that future versions of the standard will be backward compatible with older versions, but the VERSION tag allows newer programmes to check for a higher version of the standard or do conversions if required to be backward compatible. Data Formats * Record Set ‚Äì A special tag that starts a particular set of data. For example, an XML table that consists of a set of hops records might start with a tag to denote that this is the start of hops records. After the last record, a tag would be used. * Record - Denotes a tag that starts or ends a particular record‚Äîfor example \\"HOP\\" might start a hops record or \\"FERMENTABLE\\" might start a fermentable record. * Percentage - Denotes a percentage - all percentages are expressed as percent out of 100- for example 10.4% is written as \\"10.4\\" and not \\"0.104\\" * List - The data has only a fixed number of values that are selected from the list in the description table for the tag. These items are case sensitive, and no other values are allowed. * Text - The data is free format text. For multiline entries, line breaks will be preserved where possible and the text may be truncated on import if the text is too long for the importing program to store. Multiline entries may be split with either a newline (Unix format) or a carriage return ‚Äì newline combination (DOS format). Importing programmes should accept either. * Boolean - The Boolean data type may be either TRUE or FALSE, with TRUE and FALSE in capitals. A default value should be specified for optional fields - the default is used if the value is not present. * Integer - An integer number with no decimal point. May include negative values - examples include ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,... * Floating Point - A floating point number, usually expressed in its simplest form with a decimal point as in \\"1.2\\", \\"0.004\\", etc... Programmes should endeavor to store as many significant digits as possible to avoid truncating or losing small values. Units All units are fixed. It is the responsibility of the importing or exporting programme to convert to and from the units below if needed. ; Weight Units: All weights are measured in Kilograms (kg). For small values the exporting programme will make an effort to preserve as many significant digits as possible. ; Volume Units: All volumes are measured in Litres (l). For small values the exporting programme will make an effort to preserve as many significant digits as possible. ; Temperature Units: All temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. ; Time Units: All times are given in minutes or fractions thereof ‚Äì unless otherwise specified in the tag description. ; Specific Gravity Units: Specific gravity are measured relative to the weight of the same size sample of water. For example, ‚Äú1.035‚Äù, ‚Äú1.060‚Äù, and so on. ; Pressure Units: Pressures are measured in kilopascals (kPa) Non-Standard Tags As per the XML standard, all non-standard tags should be ignored by the importing programme. This allows programmes to store additional information if desired using their own tags. Any tags not defined as part of this standard may safely be ignored by the importing programme. Optional tags The optional 'Appendix A' adds tags for use in the display of brewing data using XML style sheets or XML compatible report generators. As the tags in the appendix are for display only and may include rounded values and varying units. These appendix tags are intended for display and not for data import.

Worthington, Jr. is a licensed clinical psychologist and Professor of Psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). His research interests include forgiveness and other virtues, religion and spirituality in clinical practice, and the hope-focused approach to counseling couples. He has written over 30 books on topics including forgiveness of others, self- forgiveness, character strength, religion and psychology, and couples' therapy, and he has published over 350 scholarly articles and chapters. Worthington has been frequently cited as an expert on his topics of interest in the scientific literature and public media. Education and career Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Worthington attended the University of Tennessee- Knoxville and was awarded an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering in 1968. He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology on an Atomic Energy Commission Special Fellowship and received his SMNE in 1970. Worthington served as a naval officer on active duty from 1970 to 1974, teaching nuclear physics at the Naval Nuclear Power School at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He then attended graduate school in psychology (counseling) from 1974 to 1978 at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, where he received his MA and PhD degrees. He has since served as faculty in the department of psychology at VCU, primarily affiliated with the APA-accredited counseling psychology program. In addition, Worthington is a licensed clinical psychologist in Virginia. In the mid-1990s, he served the Commonwealth of Virginia as director of the Mental Health Planning Council. From 1998 through 2005, he was executive director and treasurer of A Campaign for Forgiveness Research, a non-profit corporation that raised $6.4 million to fund research about forgiveness. In 2005, he served as Visiting Professor at University of Cambridge and at the University of Hong Kong. He has won numerous awards in research, teaching, and service, and in 2009, he won VCU‚Äôs top honor, the VCU Award for Excellence. Worthington is a fellow of the American Psychological Association. Research and clinical contributions=Forgiveness Worthington began investigating forgiveness as a clinical method, noting that in his practice of couple therapy most couples had issues they could not seem to forgive and those often provided roadblocks to improvement in their relationship. Working with two of his graduate students, Michael McCullough and Steve Sandage, they developed the beginning of what would eventually become the REACH Forgiveness method for psychoeducational groups. The REACH method has been tested in over 22 randomized clinical trials by numerous investigators around the world and it is one of the two most studied methods to promote forgiveness. In addition, REACH Forgiveness has been used in psychotherapy, across cultures, with parents, in couple therapy and enrichment, in Christian communities, in classrooms, and in workbooks for at home use. Worthington has made a number of theoretical contributions to understanding forgiveness. First, he has suggested that larger felt injustices‚Äîi.e., larger ‚Äúinjustice gaps‚Äù‚Äîare harder to forgive than smaller injustices. The size of the injustice gap is directly related to the difficulty forgiving. Offender apologies, restitution, and victim perceptions of the offender suffering, guilt, and remorse reduce the size of the injustice gap, making offenses easier to forgive. Second, he has observed that the victim can reduce the size of the injustice gap by many ways, such as successful revenge (although that obviously will usually increase hostilities), turning the matter over to God for divine justice or to relinquish it to God, forbearing, or accepting that ‚Äústuff happens‚Äù and moving on with life. The person could also reduce the injustice gap by forgiving. Third, there are two separate types of forgiveness. Decisional forgiveness occurs when a person decides to act without malice or to act in such a way to treat the offender as a valued person and forswear vengeance. Emotional forgiveness is hypothesized to be the emotional replacement of negative unforgiving emotions with positive other-oriented emotions (i.e., empathy, sympathy, compassion, or even love toward the offender). Substantial evidence supports this emotional replacement hypothesis. Fourth, emotional replacement is at the core of the REACH Forgiveness intervention, in addition to defining the two types of forgiveness and making a decision to forgive. Religion and spirituality, especially in psychotherapy In the mid-1980s, Worthington conducted research on and summarized existing research on religiously tailored psychotherapy. In a theoretical article, he put forth the concept that a client who valued religion tended to see the world through religious values. He argued that clients held a subjective zone of toleration of values by which they evaluated psychotherapists. If the psychotherapist‚Äôs values were perceived to be outside of the client‚Äôs zone of toleration, then poor response to psychotherapy or drop out was a likely outcome. Over the years, Worthington and his colleagues have shown through meta-analyses and qualitative reviews of research that religious and spiritual matching to a client‚Äôs religious values‚Äîwhen the client is highly religious‚Äîimproves outcome in psychotherapy. Nevertheless, in strictly matched treatments in which religious clients are randomly assigned to religious or secular treatment, differing only in the use (or not) of religious language and examples, religious and spiritual clients show little difference regardless of religious or secular psychotherapy. There is a suggestion that this is because clients who are religious employ their faith perspective regardless of whether the counselor introduces it specifically. In 2012, a joint task force of the Society of Clinical Psychology and the Division 29 (Psychotherapy) of the American Psychological Association evaluated a meta-analysis by Worthington and his colleagues to conclude that the evidence supporting religious or spiritual matching was demonstrably effective. Hope-focused couple approach Worthington formulated the hope-focused couple approach (HFCA) during the 1980s, and by 1989, the essence of it was in place. By 1999, he articulated a focus (i.e., hope), a strategy (i.e., promoting faith, work, and love), and major targets of intervention (i.e., communication and conflict resolution and intimacy, forgiveness, and reconciliation). He cataloged over 150 intervention techniques in his 1999 book, and Jennifer Ripley and he cataloged an additional 100 techniques in their 2014 book. The revised approach places more emphasis on attachment theory and uses forgiveness interventions as more prominent parts of couple therapy.

P. 467. High Medieval Europe This genre, unlike most genres of piyyut, does not go back to late antique Palestine, but rather to high medieval Europe. The first known author to write a poem in this genre was Joseph Kimhi, who was born in Muslim Spain, but spent his later life in Narbonne, Provence.Ezra Fleischer, \\"Poetic Embellishments of the Prayer ‚ÄòMagen Avot‚Äô \\" (; Tarbiz 45 (1976-7), issue 1-2), p. 90. Kimhi wrote two piyyutim to embellish this prayer: the first one, ‚ÄúYom Shabbat Zakhor‚Äù (◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ñ◊õ◊ï◊®), is intended to be recited before the beginning of the standard liturgical paragraph ‚ÄúMagen Avot‚Äù, and every line ends in the syllable \\"-hu\\", to rhyme with the end of the first sentence of ‚ÄúMagen Avot‚Äù (ha-‚Äôel ha-qadosh she-‚Äôen kamohu);Fleischer, \\"Poetic Embellishments\\", p. 92. the second one, ‚ÄúYom Shabbat Shamor‚Äù, is intended to be recited before the second line of the standard paragraph (\\"He gives rest to His people on His holy Sabbath day, for He desired them, to give rest to them\\"), and every line ends in the syllables \\"-lehem\\", to rhyme with the end of that second line in the standard paragraph, (ki vam ra·∫ìa le-hania·∏• lahem).Fleischer, \\"Poetic Embellishments\\", p. 94. These two poems of Joseph Kimhi had very different fates; ‚ÄúYom Shabbat Zakhor‚Äù became quite popular, and appears in a number of manuscripts; the first two lines even made it into printed rites, and are recited even today in some synagogues of the Western Ashkenazic Rite on the evening of the Festival of Shavu‚Äòot that falls on the Sabbath.See Wolf Heidenheim, ed., Ma·∏•zor for the Festival of Shavu‚Äòot (Hebrew: ◊û◊ó◊ñ◊ï◊® ◊ú◊ó◊í ◊î◊©◊ë◊ï◊¢◊ï◊™), R√∂delheim 1831; folio 77a; available online at: http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43202&st;=&pgnum;=218. Though Joseph Kimhi was in Provence, the genre really became popular only in Germany. In the late 13th century, Samuel Devlin of Erfurt wrote a Magen Avot poem ‚ÄúShipperam Ram Be-ru·∏•o‚Äù (◊©◊§◊®◊ù ◊®◊ù ◊ë◊®◊ï◊ó◊ï), following the style of ‚ÄúYom Shabbat Zakhor‚Äù, and intended to be inserted in the same place in the liturgy.Fleischer, \\"Poetic Embellishments\\", 95 f. Like Kimhi's poems, this one is about the Sabbath in general. Later German poets wrote piyyutim of this general specifically for special Sabbaths, and Sabbaths that fell on holidays; these poems speak not only about the Sabbath, but also about the specific themes of the given holiday. The twentieth-century scholar Ezra Fleischer collected, from Ashkenazic manuscripts, no fewer than eighteen such poems, by various poets, for occasions throughout the year, such as: a Sabbath that falls on Rosh Chodesh, or Hanukkah, or Rosh Hashana, or Shabbat Na·∏•amu; and lifecycle events, such as a Sabbath on which a wedding or circumcision is being celebrated in the community.Fleischer, Poetic Embellishments, pp. 97-104 In all of these, every line ends with the rhyming syllable \\"-hu\\", just as in ‚ÄúYom Shabbat Zakhor‚Äù.

He married Mar√≠a of Navarra, daughter of Carlos II of Navarre, on January 20, 1393 in Tudela, Navarra. After her death, he contracted a second marriage with Violant of Villafeliche. He had no legitimate children but a son out of wedlock named Jaime of Aragon, whom his father inherited with the barony of Aren√≥s and other places. He was pretender to the throne of the Crown of Aragon during the Caspe Compromise after the death of his father claiming a better right to the throne being descendant by King Jaime II of Aragon male straight, but had very little support and finished the final vote without any vote in his favor. He fought beside Fernando of Antequera, who was elected King of Aragon, during the siege of Balaguer when Jaime II of Urgell, one of the pretenders to the throne, revolted against King Ferdinand, blocking the city portal of Lleida, and negotiating the surrender of the rebels. Alfonso the younger prompted the construction of important monuments such as the Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba and the Ducal Palace of Gand√≠a, which were formerly initiated by his father Alfonso of Aragon and Foix, the old. On his death without legitimate descendants came a lawsuit by the succession of their territories, which was resolved temporarily giving Gandia to Hugo Cardona and Ribagorza.

It was the first theatre in the Ottoman Turkey where plays were performed by Turkish actors, whereas previous theatres in the Ottoman Empire had only employed Western travelling theatre troupes or non-Muslim Ottoman people such as Armenians. \\"With its regular Turkish performances, location, and broader audience, Gedikpa≈üa Theatre was one of the most important theatres established during the Tanzimat period. The first muslim-Turkish actors performed in Gedikpa≈üa Theatre and the famous writers of the period were composing plays for the theatre. Significantly, the theatre was not located in the Pera district, historically known as a neighbourhood in which mostly foreigners resided; instead, it was midway between √áar≈üƒ±kapƒ± and Beyazƒ±t towards the sea. The Beyazƒ±t area was a centre mostly occupied by local Turks‚Äô residences and businesses (And 1972, 214).41 This location was quite significant because it shows the targeted main audience was not only non- Muslim subjects and foreigners but also Muslim Turkish subjects. This intended audience demonstrates that the theatres not only attracted minority groups, but that Western style of arts became so popular that theatres were established in even highly populated Muslim neighbourhoods.\\" References Category:1866 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Theatres in Istanbul Category:Theatre in the Ottoman Empire Category:Theatres completed in 1866 ","title":"Gedikpa≈üa Tiyatrosu"},{"id":"41911857","text":"Garm Bit () may refer to: * Garm Bit-e Bala * Garm Bit-e Pain ","title":"Garm Bit"},{"id":"41911859","text":"Austropyrgus parvus is a species of minute freshwater snail with an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusc or micromollusc in the Hydrobiidae family.

In mathematics, the Manin conjecture describes the conjectural distribution of rational points on an algebraic variety relative to a suitable height function. It was proposed by Yuri I. Manin and his collaborators in 1989 when they initiated a program with the aim of describing the distribution of rational points on suitable algebraic varieties. Conjecture Their main conjecture is as follows. Let V be a Fano variety defined over a number field K, let H be a height function which is relative to the anticanonical divisor and assume that V(K) is Zariski dense in V. Then there exists a non-empty Zariski open subset U \\\\subset V such that the counting function of K-rational points of bounded height, defined by :N_{U,H}(B)=#{x \\\\in U(K):H(x)\\\\leq B} for B \\\\geq 1, satisfies :N_{U,H}(B) \\\\sim c B (\\\\log B)^{\\\\rho-1}, as B \\\\to \\\\infty. Here \\\\rho is the rank of the Picard group of V and c is a positive constant which later received a conjectural interpretation by Peyre.

Fontana studied art history at the University La Sapienza in Rome, with a focus on the Venetian Renaissance. She came of age in the late seventies when Italy was experiencing a renaissance of creativity and was considered a laboratory of new ideas and talents. During this time Fontana was immersed in circles of artists, musicians and writers. She was especially close to the group of writers and cartoonists involved with the publication of several independent magazines, including Il Male, Cannibale, and Frigidaire ‚Äì as well as \\"off theater\\" avant-garde experiences like the circle of the Beat 72 . In these early years Fontana met the well known cultural attach√© for the city of Rome, Renato Nicolini. His ideas of bringing culture in to the streets trespassing boundaries of high and low that culminated with the Estate Romana (Roman Summer), became influential for her later activity as cultural producer.  Early career  In the late 1980s, after few years working in advertising, Fontana became increasingly active and involved in contemporary art as an independent curator for galleries and public institutions. With Laura Ruggeri and Gianni Romano she initiated the first archive of women artists working in Italy, which is now housed at DOCVA (Documentation Centre for Visual Arts) in Milan. In 1991 she organized \\"An English View\\" at the British Academy in Rome, the first show in Italy of YBA (Young British Art).

The recording was produced by Kevin Killen, who has worked with Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, and U2, and engineered by Ken Thomas, who has worked with David Bowie and Sigur R√≥s. The album cover for If was designed by the late Storm Thorgerson, who created cover artwork for several Pink Floyd albums. goodbyemotel‚Äôs current lineup includes: Australian natives Tom Marks, David Schmidt, and Scott Pioro; Swedish/Australian lead singer and guitarist Gustaf Sj√∂din Enstr√∂m; Rochester, NY drummer Paul Amorese. \\"The 4D Live Music Experience\\" goodbyemotel has developed the unique \\"4D Live Music Experience,\\" during which the band performs in front of a scrim onto which film and 3D images are projected. Audience members are given 3-D glasses upon admission to the show so that they may experience the full effects. After several songs, the scrim is eventually dropped, leaving the band to perform a more conventional rock concert. After debuting their conceptual live video performance in New York City, they have since performed it on stages all over the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia.

The company was founded in 1993 by W. Allan Jones in Cleveland, Tennessee, where the headquarters are located today. The firm offers payday loans, online payday advances, title loans, bill payment services, check cashing, reloadable prepaid debit cards, and Western Union money transfers and money order services.  History  Check Into Cash store Jones founded Check Into Cash in 1993. He has been referred to as \\"the father of the payday lending industry\\" for creating the first national payday lending chain. In 1973, at age 20, he left college, where he had been pursuing a business degree, to help stabilize the family‚Äôs business, the Credit Bureau of Cleveland (TN). He purchased the reporting and debt collection business in 1977 and built it into one of the largest credit bureau databases in Tennessee. He sold the credit reporting side of the business to Equifax in 1988, retaining the name and collection agency division. He then built the company to be the largest in the state and sold it in 1998. Check Into Cash has grown to become one of the largest payday loan companies in the United States, with over 1,200 locations. In 2012, the firm acquired Cash and Cheque Express, a consumer financial services chain in the United Kingdom. In 2013, the firm acquired Great American Pawn and Title and Quick loans, both based in Georgia, plus Great American Cash Advance and Nations Quick Cash Title Pawn, which operate in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Check Into Cash has also acquired Title First Title Pawn, which is based in Georgia.  Other organizations  Check Into Cash is a founding member of the Community Financial Services Association of America, which sets best practices standards for its members in the payday advance industry. The firm has affiliate companies that operate under these brand names: *U.S. Money Shops *U.S. Money Title Loan *U.S. Money Shops Pawn *Check Into Cash Title Pawn *LoanByPhone.com *Title First Title Pawn *Great American Pawn and Title *Great American Cash Advance *Quic!oans *Nations Quick Cash Title Pawn  Criticism  The company has been criticized for its exorbitant interest rates and has been accused of exploiting the poor. The payday loan model is instituted with the intent that customers will be unable to pay back the debt in the allotted time, causing them to renew the loan multiple times, resulting in interest several times greater than the original sum of money borrowed. This business model, once illegal in many states was made possible after Jones donated to the campaigns of several state legislators, convincing them to legalize it.

Mission According to its website, CULCON‚Äôs mission is: ‚ÄúThe U.S.-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange (CULCON) is a bi-national advisory panel that serves to elevate and strengthen the vital cultural and educational foundations of the U.S.-Japan relationship, and to strengthen connections between U.S. and Japan leadership in those fields. It works to ensure that the best of new ideas for cultural, educational and intellectual activity and exchange are implemented as operational programs.‚Äù History The U.S.-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange (CULCON) is a program of the U.S. Department of State in the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan CULCON originated in a series of discussions between President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda in 1961 as a high-level advisory panel to the two governments for educational and cultural exchanges. This arrangement was formalized by an exchange of memoranda between the two governments in 1968. Beginning in 1978, CULCON became a program of the United States Information Agency. In 1999, with the restructuring of USIA and the Department of State, CULCON returned to the U.S. Department of State, Office of the Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. In 1991, permanent secretariats were established in Tokyo and Washington to provide continuity to CULCON activities. In the U.S., the secretariat was established within the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission, an independent federal agency that supports reciprocal people-to-people understanding and promotes partnerships that advance common interests between Japan and the United States.In Japan, the secretariat was established in the Japan Foundation, Japan's first public institution dedicated to sharing Japanese culture and language with people throughout the world. Since then, U.S. CULCON has become a high-level, dynamic organization that has identified timely issues and responded with a range of creative solutions in areas such as educational exchange, media, digital culture, arts exchange and information access and global leaders. The solutions are a direct result of the gatherings and discussions of CULCON‚Äôs unique grouping of public and private sector members and the engagement of its Panelists. Most recently, CULCON convened a bi-national Educational Task Force to examine decreasing trends of Japanese students studying abroad in the U.S. The Task Force made recommendations to leaders in both nations to double the number of study abroad students in each country by 2020. CULCON Education Task Force In January 2013, CULCON members from Japan and the United States met in Hawaii to examine downward trends in bilateral student exchanges and to create a bi- national Task Force that would make recommendations concerning the data in order to increase student exchanges. The Task Force convened to examine an alarming decrease in the number of Japanese students in the United States and to make recommendations to leaders in both nations towards an ambitious goal: to double the number of study abroad students in each country by 2020.Over the past 15 years, there has been a 57 percent drop in the number of Japanese students studying in the United States, from over 47,000 students in 1997-1998 to fewer than 20,000 in 2011-2012. During the same period, Japan fell from being the number-one country of origin for foreign students on U.S. campuses to seventh place. In the same period, U.S. citizens studying in Japan tripled, reaching 6,000, largely as a result of CULCON efforts established in the 1990s. To examine these trends and their economic implications for both countries, CULCON convened a task force of specialists from a variety of fields and perspectives, including the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of State, as well as the Japanese Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In May 2013 the CULCON Education Task Force issued a Report and Recommendations. Report addresses country specific recommendations as well as bi-national cooperative actions. The Task Force encourages for-profit and nonprofit private sector, the higher education community and the governments for both countries to take specific measures to improve English proficiency of Japanese students, for example, and a recommendation to reform the Japanese academic calendar would enable more Japanese students to study abroad and to internationalize Japanese universities. The Report also examines ways the Japanese hiring practices could be reformed to allow more students to study abroad. Collective actions for both countries include providing additional funding to students to compensate for the high costs of studying abroad. In addition to recommending these institutional changes, the Task Force Report highlights both governments‚Äô role in creating an environment that will encourage overseas exchange. In June 2014, the Report was presented in Tokyo to Prime Minister Abe and in Washington D.C. to Undersecretary Tara Sonenshine. Around the same time, Prime Minister Abe announced a series of structural reforms to underpin economic growth. Key themes of the policy include improving English language instruction, included replacing 1500 lecturers in eight Japanese universities with foreign professors, doubling the number of foreign professors who are in Japan now; lifting eight Japanese institutions into the global top 100 in the next ten years (currently, Tokyo University in 27th in the world and Kyoto University is 52nd); using the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) to raise the standard of English in bureaucrats and students alike. The plan would mandate that individuals reach or exceed a threshold in scores on the TOEFL to gain college admission and to qualify for government jobs; and finally, collaborate with overseas counterparts to offer joint degrees to encourage studying abroad and learning English. Abe has also asserted that he would like to make English a required course starting from elementary schools and has expressed interest in reducing the financial burden to students in order to allow them to travel and study abroad. Many of the aforementioned reforms are directly correlated with the Recommendations made by the CULCON Education Task Force. ReferencesBibliography *Hayden, Craig.

The village used to be in the Barkston Ash Wapentake and up until 1974, it was in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The village is just east off the A19 road, which crosses the River Aire on Haddlesey Bridge. Overview At the west end of the village is the Church of England primary school, which has an age range of 4-11, and an average of 50 pupils on the roster. The St John the Baptist Church is at the east end of the village. The church was built in 1836 on the site of a previous religious house that dated back to the 14th century. Originally the church was a chapel of ease, as it was part of the parish of Birkin. It formed its own parish, along with the nearby villages of Temple Hirst and Hirst Courtney in 1873. Boats used to travel up the River Aire to the south of the village and a weir and lock (Haddlesey Old Lock) were constructed in 1702. The lock became redundant upon the opening of the Selby Canal in 1778, but the weir was kept in place to allow headwaters to build up and keep the mouth from the canal at Selby in deep water. The canal mouth is at West Haddlesey, which is just to the west of Chapel Haddlesey. In 2016, Haddlesey Old Lock was converted into a hydro power station to generate enough electricity for 440 homes. The bottom of the lock is also the normal tidal limit for the River Aire.

Life The son of Dr. Thomas Wilson Bolton, surgeon, of London and Manchester, he enlisted in the Royal Artillery, in which he rose to be a non-commissioned officer, getting his first step as acting bombardier at Halifax, Nova Scotia. He obtained a commission as ensign in the Gold Coast artillery corps on 4 September 1857, and served in the expedition against the Krobo people, a small, prosperous ethnic group living east of Accra, in September, October, and November 1858, being present at the action of Krobo Heights on 18 September. He was promoted to be lieutenant on 9 November In June and July 1859 he was adjutant in the successful expedition against the Danquah rebels. \\"Krobo Hill\\", 1890s photograph, now Krobo Mountain, Ghana On his return to England Bolton was transferred to the 12th Regiment of Foot and promoted as captain on 21 September 1860. He was for several years engaged with Captain Philip Howard Colomb R.N. in developing a system of visual signalling, applicable to naval and military operations, which was adopted by the authorities. He also invented and developed an application of the oxy-calcium light for night signalling. The Army and Navy Signal Book was compiled by Bolton and Colomb, assisted by an officer of Royal Engineers, and was used during the British Expedition to Abyssinia of 1867/8. From 1867 to 1869 Bolton was deputy-assistant quartermaster-general and assistant instructor in visual signalling at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, under Captain Richard Hugh Stotherd, the instructor in telegraphy. He was promoted on 8 July 1868 to an unattached majority in consideration of his services in army signalling. Bolton was largely instrumental in 1871 in founding the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians, of which he became honorary secretary. He edited its Journal, and was afterwards vice-president. In 1871 Bolton was appointed by the Board of Trade under the Metropolis Water Act to be water examiner to London. He was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel on 15 June 1877, and retired from the military service with the honorary rank of colonel on 1 July 1881. Bolton was knighted in 1884. He died on 5 January 1887 at the Royal Bath Hotel, Bournemouth, Hampshire. Works Bolton designed the displays of coloured fountains and electric lights which formed prominent features of the exhibitions at South Kensington from 1883 to 1886; they were worked from the central tower under his personal superintendence. He was the author of: * London Water Supply, 1884, of which a new edition, with an exposition of the law relating to water companies by Philip Arthur Scratchley, was published in 1888; * Description of the Illuminated Fountain and of the Water Pavilion, 1884, originally delivered as a lecture at the International Health Exhibition. Family Bolton married in 1866 Julia, second daughter of R. Mathews of Oatlands Park, Surrey; she survived him.

This freedom has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends. Naming traditions play a role in the cohesion and communication within American cultures. Cultural diversity in the U.S. has led to great variations in names and naming traditions and names have been used to express creativity, personality, cultural identity, and values. Naming laws Traditionally, the right to name one's child or oneself as one chooses has been upheld by court rulings and is rooted in the Due Process Clause of the fourteenth Amendment and the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, but a few restrictions do exist. Restrictions vary by state, but most are for the sake of practicality. For example, several states limit the number of characters that can be used due to the limitations of the software used for official record keeping. For similar reasons, some states ban the use of numerical digits or pictograms. A few states ban the use of obscenity. There are also a few states, Kentucky for instance, that have no naming laws whatsoever. Despite the freedom that Americans have regarding names, controversies do exist. In 2013, Tennessee judge Lu Ann Ballew ruled that a baby boy named Messiah must change his name to Martin stating \\"it's a title that has only been earned by one person ‚Ä¶ Jesus Christ.\\" The decision was overturned in chancery court a month later and the child retained his birth name. Ballew was fired and a disciplinary hearing was scheduled on the basis that the name change order violated Tennessee's code of Judicial Conduct. No laws exist banning the use of religious names and judges are required to perform their duties without regard to religious bias. Names with accents and/or non-English letters One naming law that some find restrictive is California's ban on diacritical marks, such as in Jos√©, a common Spanish name. The Office of Vital Records in California requires that names contain only the 26 alphabetical characters of the English language, plus hyphens and apostrophes. Some states (for example, Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, North Carolina, Oregon) allow accents and some non-English letters in birth certificates and other documents. There can be problems for persons with such names when moving to a state where such characters are banned and they have to renew their documents. There is no law restricting the use of diacritical marks informally and many parents get around the restrictions by doing so. Some city names contain diacritics, even in US states that forbid diacritics in people's legal names (see List of U.S. cities with diacritics.) Foreigners whose last name contains accents and/or non-English letters (e.g. Mu√±oz, G√∂√ümann) may experience problems, since their names in their passports and in other documents are spelled differently (e.g., the German name G√∂√ümann may be alternatively spelled Goessmann or Gossmann), so people not familiar with the foreign orthography may doubt the authenticity of the ID. Names with symbols and capital letters in the middle In many U.S. states, hyphens and apostrophe are the only two symbols personal names can officially contain. In some computer systems and in the machine-readable zone of a passport, they are omitted (Mary-Kate O'Neill ‚Üí Mary Kate ONeill) Some names are spelled with a capital letter in the middle (LeVar Burton, LaToya Jackson, Richard McMillan). In the machine-readable zone of a passport, the name is spelled only in capitals (LEVAR, LATOYA, MCMILLAN). African-American names The names in the Jackson family show the variety within African-American culture. La Toya is of Spanish origin, Jermaine is French, and both Michael and Janet derive from Hebrew. Many African Americans use their own or their children's names as a symbol of solidarity within their culture. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture. With the rise of the mid-century civil rights movement, there was a dramatic rise in names of various origins. One very notable influence on African-American names are Arabic names that entered the popular culture with the rise of The Nation of Islam Politico-Religious Movement among African Americans with its focus on civil rights. These popular names such as \\"Aisha\\" (with origins in the Islamic Koran) and other Arabic names such as Jamal and Malik are now also commonly used by non-Muslim African Americans regardless of religion. Many names of French origin entered the picture at this time as well. Historically French names such as Monique, Chantal, Andr√©, and Antoine became common within African American culture. Names of African origin began to crop up as well. Names like Ashanti, Tanisha, Aaliyah, and Malaika have origins in the continent of Africa. By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common within the culture to invent new names, although many of the invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re, or Ja/Je and suffixes such as -ique/iqua, -isha, and -aun/-awn are common, as well as inventive spellings for common names. The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin, but has elements pulled from both French and African roots. Other names like LaTanisha, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre. Even with the rise of creative names, it is also common for African Americans to use biblical names such as Daniel, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew as well as European names like Christopher. These names were among the most common names for African- American boys in 2013. Surname names Using surnames as a first name is increasingly popular in the United States, although the origin of this practice is unclear. In one of her books about Southern culture, Marlyn Schwartz reports that it has long been common for southern families to use family surnames as first names. The Baby Name Wizard author Laura Wattenberg explains that the practice became popular in the early 20th century as poor immigrants chose names they associated with the sophistication of English aristocracy and literature, many of them surnames. Example: Landis Kulp is also a combination of two surnames. Regardless of origins, many names that are now considered first names in the U.S. have origins as surnames. Names like Riley, Parker, Cooper, Madison, Morgan, Cameron, and Harper originated as surnames. Names that originate as surnames typically start out their lifespan as androgynous names before developing a common usage as either a masculine name or a feminine name. Tyler and Taylor had approximately the same usage for both boys and girls when they came onto the charts before diverging. Tyler is now typically given to boys while Taylor is more often given to girls. Names inspired by popular culture Without laws governing name usage, many American names pop up following the name's usage in movies, television, or in the media. Children may be named after their parents' favorite fictional characters. Samantha was a rare name in the United States until the 1870s, after the publication of a novel series by Marietta Holley with Samantha as main character. The name became popular again in the 1960s, as the comedy television show Bewitched had a lead character named Samantha. Prior to the 1984 movie Splash, Madison was almost solely heard as a surname, with occasional usage as a masculine name. The name entered the top 1000 list for girls in 1985 and has been a top 10 name since 1997. In 2014, the name Arya, the name of a character on the popular series Game of Thrones, saw a dramatic rise to the 216th most popular girls name. Names in popular culture fare better as inspiration if they fit in with current naming trends. When Barack Obama was inaugurated as president in 2009, his name had a surge in popularity, but still has not made it into the top 1000 names in the United States. His daughter Malia, on the other hand, jumped over 200 spots to the 191st spot that year. While Barack is much more influential than his daughter, Barack is a name with a sound unlike other top American names. Malia is Hawaiian, but sounds similar to top names like Amelia and Sophia. Names that fit current naming trends and have prestige attached to them fare especially well. The name Blair surfaced as a girl's name in the mid-1980s after being featured on The Facts of Life as the name of the wealthy character Blair Warner. Blair had previously been used infrequently and mostly as a masculine name. When the series aired, the perceived prestige of the name escalated and fit into the surname name trend. Some names have a variety of factors that inspire their popularity. The name Bentley was inspired by the luxury car brand, but got a further boost by the show Teen Mom when reality star Maci Bookout used the name for her son. The already popular name Tiffany had a rise in usage following the popularity of the singer Tiffany in the mid-1980s. Religion Religious names are extremely popular in the United States. Most of the popular names are rooted in the Christian Bible, but other religions are represented, such as in the popular name Mohammed. Names like Jacob, Noah, Elijah, John, Elizabeth, Leah, and Jes√∫s consistently rank very high. Some parents choose names for their religious significance, but there are also many parents who choose names based in religion because they are family names or simply because they are culturally popular. Other popular names are inspired by religion in other ways such as Nevaeh, which is Heaven spelled backwards. Christian, Faith, Angel, Trinity, Genesis, Jordan, Zion, and Eden are names which reference religion. Gender Research suggests that American parents are more likely to use established, historical names for boys and are much more likely to name boys after relatives and ancestors. Boys' names, on average, are more traditional than girls' names, and are less likely to be currently fashionable. This trend holds true across racial lines. There is a much quicker turnover within girls' names than boys'. Parents of girls are much more likely to demonstrate their creativity in the naming of their daughters than their sons. In Alice Rossi's 1965 study of naming conventions, she theorizes that the gender differences in naming strategies exist because of the perceived roles of men and women in society. \\"Women play the more crucial role in family and kin activities, while men are the symbolic carriers of temporal continuity of the family.\\" Gender name usage also plays a role in the way parents view names. It is not uncommon for American parents to give girls names that have traditionally been used for boys. Boys, on the other hand, are almost never given feminine names. Names like Ashley, Sidney, Aubrey, Courtney, and Avery originated as boys' names. Traditionally masculine or androgynous names that are used widely for girls have a tendency to be abandoned by the parents of boys and develop an almost entirely female usage. There has been a rise in the usage of gender-neutral names for both girls and boys, according to a study by the baby name website Nameberry. Sixty percent more babies of both genders received gender-neutral names in 2015 than in 2005, according to the study.https://nameberry.com/blog/post-gender-baby-names Other factors Research has demonstrated that a number of factors come into play when it comes to naming strategies. This seems to be true across racial lines. Also, higher socioeconomic status (SES) families tend to choose different names than lower SES families. Over time, the lower SES families gravitate toward those names. As those names catch on with the lower SES families, higher SES families abandon them. The name Ashley was popular among higher SES families in the early 1980s, but by the late 1980s was most popular with lower SES families. The name Madison, which was in top 10 from 1996-2014, is used largely by lower socioeconomic status families. Political status also seems to impact naming strategies. A study on babies born in 2004 in California found that conservatives were less likely to give their children unusual names than liberals. This holds true even across racial and socioeconomic lines. Among families who had less than a college education, political leanings made no major difference in naming trends, however, the study found that the less education the parents had, the more likely they were to use an uncommon name or spelling. But among caucasian families with a college education, conservative families chose different names than liberal families. College educated liberals were more likely to choose unusual names than college educated conservatives. While they both were more likely to choose unusual names, high SES college-educated liberals had different naming strategies than low SES families. Low SES families tended to choose invented names or invented spellings, while high SES liberals chose established names that are simply culturally obscure like \\"Finnegan\\" or \\"Archimedes.\\" In contrast, high SES conservatives tended to choose common historical names. The research found that the sounds chosen by liberals and conservatives varied as well. Liberals \\"favor birth names with 'softer, feminine' sounds while conservatives favor names with 'harder, masculine' phonemes.\\" Trends Baby name trends change frequently for girls and somewhat less frequently for boys. Boys' names tend to be more traditional, but Liam, Aiden, Logan, Mason and Jayden, are currently seeing a spike in popularity. One recent trend is place names. Names like London, Brooklyn, Sydney, Alexandria, Paris, and Phoenix are all seeing a spike in popularity as of the 2012 report by the Social Security Administration. Most place names are used for girls, but some are used for boys as well, such as Dallas. Other place names like Kenya, China, and Asia have been used by African Americans for years. Names containing \\"belle\\" or \\"bella\\" are very common, such as Isabella or Annabelle. Names that end in an \\"a\\" like Sophia, Mia, Olivia, and Ava are also very common for baby girls. Popular names inspired by nature include Luna (moon in some Romance languages), Autumn, Willow. Parents who desire more traditional names for girls choose names such as Elizabeth and Eleanor, both in top 50 (as of 2017). With regard to boys names, traditional names such as William, James, Benjamin, Jacob, Michael, Daniel, Matthew, Henry, Joseph are very popular, and so are names strongly associated with religion, such as Noah. Diversity among American names also seems to be increasing. In the 1950s, most babies were given a few very common names with children using nicknames to distinguish the various people with the same name. In the decades since, the number of names being used has increased dramatically. It is also more common for minorities to use traditional cultural names for their children and for themselves that are obscure in the United States. It used to be common to choose names that were likely to fit in with the larger American culture. This applied to both given names and surnames. Research suggests that fewer immigrants change their names today upon moving to America than they once did. Princeton University sociologist Douglas Massey believes that immigrants felt less pressure to change their names \\"during the 1970s and 1980s, as immigration became more a part of American life and the civil rights movement legitimated in-group pride as something to be cultivated\\". San Diego State University professor Jean Twenge believes that the shift toward unique baby names is one facet of the cultural shift in America that values individuality over conformity.

The bill was introduced in the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill According to the Congressional Research Service, this bill \\"repeals a provision of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 that reduces the cost-of-living adjustment to the retirement pay of members of the Armed Forces under age 62.\\" That provision was one of the budget saving measures which would have saved $6 billion. The cut, which would begin in December 2015, would be a one percent below inflation cut to the cost of living benefits to working-age veterans who are not disabled. Proposed amendments One proposed amendment, from Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) would outlaw illegal immigrants claiming a child tax credit. On February 11, 2014, it was considered unlikely that this would pass, although Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did say he would allow a vote on the amendment. Other proposed amendments have focused on closing some offshore tax loopholes in order to pay for the bill. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. Section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 () reduced the annual cost-of-living adjustment for annuities paid to certain military retirees and survivors by up to 1 percent. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that section 403 would reduce direct spending by $6,235 million over the 2014-2023 period. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 exempted disability retirees and certain survivors from this reduction of one percent, which reduced the savings associated with that provision to $5,662 million over that same period. S. 1963 would repeal section 403 of P.L. 113-67. Relative to CBO's February 2014 baseline, we estimate that enacting S. 1963 would increase direct spending by $6,813 million; $5,662 million through 2023, plus $1,151 million in 2024. For this proposal, the increase in spending subject to appropriation represents an increase in discretionary accrual payments to the Military Retirement Trust Fund. While those payments count against discretionary budget caps, they are intragovernmental transactions, and the exact amounts would be determined by the Department of Defense Office of the Actuary. Pursuant to section 604 of H. Con. Res. 25, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2014, and section 311 of S. Con. Res. 70, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2009, CBO estimates that S. 1963 would increase direct spending by more than $5 billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2024. Procedural history S. 1963 was introduced into the United States Senate on January 27, 2014 by Sen. Mark L. Pryor (D, AR). On February 10, 2014, the Senate voted 94-0 to end the debate on whether or not to consider the bill, meaning that they would move forward and begin considering the bill during the rest of that week. Debate and discussion On February 10, 2014, Republicans indicated that they would not support the bill as it was written that day and insisted that the bill needed to contain an offset to counteract the additional $6 billion that would be spent if the bill was passed. Senator Pryor, who introduced the bill argued that \\"there is no question that we need to cut our spending, but we must do it responsibly... We cannot balance the budget on the backs of our service members.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 1963 *beta.congress.gov S. 1963 *GovTrack.us S. 1963 *OpenCongress.org S. 1963 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 1963 *Congressional Budget Office's Cost Estimate of S. 1963 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"S. 1963 (113th Congress)"},{"id":"41912761","text":"Felix Skowronek (August 21, 1935 ‚Äì April 17, 2006) was an American flutist and professor of music.

One is located on the island of Pladda in the south and the other two can be found on Holy Island in Lamlash Bay to the east of Arran. All three are still in service and maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board. They are now fully automatic since the electrification of both lighthouses on Holy Isle in 1977.  History  Until up to the appointment of the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses (later Northern Lighthouse Board) by royal act in 1786, just 4 lighthouses existed in the whole of Scotland. Over the course of the following 200 years, the NLB expanded greatly and is now responsible for 206 lighthouses, 163 buoys, 29 beacons, 2 supply and maintenance ships and a variety of other traditional and modern navigational aids. For a long time, lighthouses mostly burned wood, coal and candles before oil became predominant. Oil was mostly used in the form of whale oil and colza oil before the introduction of kerosene in the mid 19th century and eventually electricity. Mainland stations excepted, lights were mostly manned by 3 lighthouse keepers with 3 colleagues on shore leave on a 4 weeks on 4 weeks off rotation. Keepers were expected to be on duty at night to supervise the proper function of the lights, keep a 24-hour watch for fog and maintain and service the station during daytime. A first programme of automation in the early 20th century reduced the numbers necessary to staff a station and many lighthouse keepers were made redundant. In the 1980s and 1990s, all Scottish lighthouses were eventually fully automated and the process was completed in 1998.  Lighthouses = Pladda  Pladda lighthouse is a white tower with a height of 29 metres. It is the oldest of the Arran lighthouses and situated on the Isle of Pladda just off the Southern tip of the Isle of Arran. Pladda lighthouse is not only the oldest lighthouse around Arran but also one of the oldest lighthouses in Scotland. Pladda lighthouse was built in 1790 by Thomas Smith and showing a lower light from a small lantern 20 feet below the main light to allow seafareres to distinguish Pladda from other lighthouses close by, notably those on the Mull of Kintyre, Cumbrae and Copeland at the Irish coast. The lighthouse was rebuilt between 1821 and 1830. Pladda was one of Northern Lights' lighthouses where paraffin as a new fuel together with multiple wicks were tested successfully in 1870. This allowed substantial savings with a simultaneous increase in power between 10% and 100%. Fog signals were introduced in the 1870s as well. In 1901, the formerly fixed light was changed to a more powerful group-flashing which was Northern Light's plan for most Scottish lighthouses at the time. Pladda lighthouse operates fully automatic since 1990. Pladdas position is 55¬∞ 25.512'N, 005¬∞ 07.113'W. Its light flashes Fl.(3)30s40m23M. Pladda lighthouse Holy Isle, Inner lighthouse  The Inner lighthouse on Holy Isle faces the east coast of the Isle of Arran at the south entrance of Lamlash Bay. The lighthouse was built in 1877. With automation at the beginning of the 20th century, one lightkeeper was made redundant. At the same time, an oil tank was set up on the pier at Holy Isle. The oil was then pumped to the light house by air pressure where before, oil barrels had to be landed and then rolled to the oil cellar and pumped by hand into the cisterns. In 1977, the Holy Island lighthouses were electrified, fully automated and classified as unattended at the same time. Holy Isle Inner lighthouse is 23 m high and white.

Inner lighthouse, Holy Isle  Holy Isle, Outer or Pillar Rock lighthouse  Pillar Rock lighthouse is the youngest of the three lighthouses around the Isle of Arran and was built in 1905 on the southwestern shore of Holy Isle to the east of Arran in Lamlash Bay. It was the Northern Lighthouse Board's first square lighthouse. Together with Holy Isle's Inner lighthouse, Pillar Rock was electrified in 1977 and operates fully automatic since.

The technique constructs an internal representation of all computations and sub-computations performed during the execution of a buggy program and then asks the programmer about the correctness of such computations. By asking the programmer questions or using a formal specification, the system can identify precisely where in a program a bug is located. Debugging techniques can dramatically reduce the time and effort spent on debugging. Overview Program debugging is an extremely common part of software development. Until the 1980s the craft of program debugging, practiced by every programmer, was without any theoretical foundation.Silva, Josep. \\"A survey on algorithmic debugging strategies.\\" Advances in Engineering Software 42.11 (2011): 976-991/ In the early 1980s, systematic and principled approaches to program debugging were developed. In general, a bug occurs when a programmer has a specific intention regarding what the program should do, yet the program actually written exhibits a different behavior than intended in a particular case. One way of organizing the debugging process is to automate it (at least partially) via an algorithmic debugging technique.Zeller, Andreas. Why programs fail: a guide to systematic debugging. Elsevier, 2009./ The idea of algorithmic debugging is to have a tool that guides the programmer along the debugging process interactively: It does so by asking the programmer about possible bug sources. The algorithmic debugging technique constructs an internal representation of all computations and sub- computations performed during the execution of a buggy program (an execution tree). Then, it asks the programmer about the correctness of such computations. The programmer answers \\"YES\\" when the result is correct or \\"NO\\" when the result is wrong. Some algorithmic debuggers also accept the answer \\"I don't know\\" when the programmer cannot give an answer (e.g., because the question is too complex). Thus, the answers of the programmer guide the search for the bug until it is isolated by discarding correct parts of the program. The algorithmic debugging process finds one bug at a time. In order to find different bugs, the process should be restarted again for each different bug. Origins, current and future directions Algorithmic debugging was first developed by Ehud Shapiro during his PhD research at Yale University, as introduced in his PhD thesis,Shapiro, Ehud Y. (1983). Algorithmic program debugging. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. selected as a 1982 ACM Distinguished Dissertation. Shapiro implemented the method of algorithmic debugging in PrologClocksin, William F., and Christopher S. Mellish. Programming in PROLOG. Vol. 4. Berlin etc.: Springer, 1987. (a general purpose logic programming language) for the debugging of logic programs. In case of logic programs, the intended behavior of the program is a model (a set of simple true statements) and bugs are manifested as program incompleteness (inability to prove a true statement) or incorrectness (ability to prove a false statement). The algorithm would identify a false statement in the program and provide a counter-example to it or a missing true statement that it or its generalization should be added to the program. A method to handle non- termination was also developed. The research and development in the field of Algorithmic debugging has made major improvements over the original algorithms for debugging Prolog and other and extended the ideas to other language paradigms such as functional languages and object oriented languages.Naish, Lee.

The earliest records of the history of the regions which now form Romania were made after the establishment of three Greek townsHistria, Tomis, and Callatison the Black Sea coast in the 7th and 6th centuries BC. They developed into important centers of commerce and had a close relationship with the natives. The latter were first described by Herodotus, who made mention of the Getae of the Lower Danube region, the Agathyrsi of Transylvania and the Sygannae of Cri≈üana. Archaeological research prove that Celts dominated Transylvania between the middle of the 5th century and the end of the 3rd century BC. The Bastarnaea warlike Germanic tribesettled in the regions to the east of the Carpathian Mountains around 200 BC. Confrontations between the natives and the Roman Empire began in the late 1st century BC. Among the former, the Dacianswho were closely connected to the Getaerose to eminence under King Burebista ( 80‚Äì44 BC). He unified the tribes dwelling between the Middle Danube, the Northern Carpathians, the Dniester and the Balkan Mountains into a powerful, but ephemeral empire. It disintegrated into at least four parts after his death. Large territories to the north of the Lower Danubethe lands between the Tisa, the Northern Carpathians, the Dniester and the Lower Danubewere again unified for less than two decades by King Decebalus of the Dacians (87‚Äì106 AD). Modern Dobrujathe territory between the Lower Danube and the Black Seawas the first historical region of Romania to have been incorporated in the Roman Empire. The region was attached to the Roman province of Moesia between 46 and 79 AD. The Romans also occupied Banat, Oltenia and Transylvania after the fall of Decebalus and the disintegration of his kingdom in 106. The three regions together formed the new province of Dacia. The new province was surrounded by \\"barbarian\\" tribes, including the Costoboci, the Iazyges and the Roxolani. New Germanic tribesthe Buri and the Vandalsarrived and settled in the vicinity of Dacia province in the course of the Marcomannic Wars in the second half of the 2nd century. Background The thinking figurines of the Hamangia culturethe \\"Thinkers\\" (National History and Archaeology Museum, Constan»õa) Hoes, coulters and other tools made of antler were unearthed at nine \\"Schela Cladovei\\" settlements along the Lower Danube, suggesting that cultivation of plants began in the lands now forming Romania between around 9500 and 7500 BC. Animal husbandry appeared 1500 or 2000 years later with the arrival of a new populationthe bearers of the \\"Gura Baciului- C√¢rcea/Precri≈ü culture\\"from the southern parts of the Balkan Peninsula. They lived in pit-houses and used chiseled stone tools. They decorated their fine pottery with geographical figures and produced clay figurines. Cucuteni- Trypillian\\" figurine The antrophomorphic figurines of the \\"Hamangia culture\\", which flourished in the region between the Lower Danube and the Black Sea until around 4000 BC, are outstanding representatives of Neolithic art. In addition to figurines, colored pottery featured the \\"Cucuteni- Trypillian culture\\" of Muntenia, northeastern Moldavia and southern Transylvania. \\"Cucuteni-Trypillian\\" settlements, which often covered an area reaching , flourished until around 2000 BC. Production of copper tools and artifactspins, hooks, and pendantsand the use of gold can also be demonstrated from the last centuries of the Stone Age. Practically nothing is known of the languages spoken by the locals in this period. Historiansfor instance, Vlad Georgescu and Mihai Roteasay that the spread of Indo-European languages began in the period between 2500 and 2000 BC. Fortified settlements and the great number of weaponsarrowheads, spears and knife bladesunearthed in them show that the stability featuring the Stone Age cultures of \\"Old Europe\\" came to an end in the same period. Co»õofeni\\" vessels Coexistence of a great number of transitory cultures, including the \\"Co»õofeni\\" and \\"Glina cultures\\" characterized the first centuries of the Bronze Age. Metallurgy developed in the following period; deposits containing thousands of bronze tools, weapons and jewels from between around 2000 and 1500 BC were unearthed at many places, including Uioara de Sus and »òpƒÉlnaca in Transylvania. Finds of amber delivered from the coast of the Baltic Sea and weapons produced in Mycenaean Greece show the importance of trading with these distant regions of Europe. From around 1100 BC, a homogenization of pottery decorations and the development of new archaeological cultures can be detected. These new cultures spread over large territories; for instance, the \\"Basarabi culture\\" flourished in the wider region of the Lower Danube. The sporadic use of iron also began around 1100 BC, but it only became widespread about 350 years later. Before the Romans=Greek colonies Ionian colonists from Miletus founded Histria, the first Greek town on the Black Sea coast of present-day Romania. According to Eusebius of Caesarea's Chronicle, this happened in 657 BC. Archaeological findsmainly potterysuggest that the first Greek colonists settled in Histria between the 650s and 620s BC. The second colony, Tomis was also founded by settlers from Miletus who arrived in the 7th or 6th century BC. However, the sparseness of archaeological evidence from the first centuries of the history of Tomis implies that it was initially administered from Histria. The third Greek town, Callatis was founded by Dorian colonists from Heraclea Pontica in the second half of the 6th century BC. Ruins of the walls of Histria Inscriptions from Histria and Callatis prove that the townsfolk preserved their ancestral traditions for more than half a millennium. They maintained the ancient denominations for their tribes, magistrates, and public bodies, and remained faithful to cults taken from the motherland. The three colonies developed into important centers of trade in olive oil, wine, fine pottery and jewelry. A level of houses and temples destroyed proves that an unidentified enemyaccording to the scholar Paul MacKendrick, Scythianstook and sacked Histria in the late 6th century BC. Initially, the constitution of Histria was an oligarchy, but, as Aristotle recorded, \\"it ended in the rule of the populace\\".Aristotle: The Politics (1305.a.37), p. 219. MacKendrick writes that this change from the rule of aristocratic families to democracy occurred around 450 BC. Thereafter an assembly and council administered Histria; their members were elected by the free male citizens of the town. Callatis also became democracy in the second half of the 5th century BC. According to MacKendrick, the fragment \\"KA‚Ä¶\\" in an inscription listing the Greek towns paying tribute to Athens refers to Callatis, proving that the town became a member of the Delian League. Ruins in Callatis For defensive purposes, both Histria and Callatis were surrounded by walls: the former in the 4th and 2nd centuries BC, the latter in the 4th century BC. King Lysimachus of Thrace forced Histria to accept his suzerainty in the 310s BC, and Celts sacked the town in 279 BC. Histria and Callatis attempted to take the port of Tomis, but they were defeated around 262 BC. Getae Remains of a tumulus from the 4th century BC (Cucuteni) The natives of the Lower Danube region came to the attention of classical authors after the establishment of Greek colonies along the Black Sea shore. In the early 5th century BC, Hecataeus of Miletus's Europe referred to two local tribes, the Crobydae and the Trixae. Sophocles wrote of a local ruler named Charnabon in his Triptolemos. Herodotus was the first writer who thoroughly described the tribes dwelling to the north of the Lower Danube. He wrote of the Getae in connection with King Darius I of Persia's campaign against the Scythians in about 513 BC. According to Herodotus, the Getae, \\"the most courageous and upright Thracian tribe, offered stiff resistance\\",Herodotus: The Histories (4.93), p. 266. but the Persians defeated and enslaved them. He also described the Getae's belief in the immortality of the soul and their practice of human sacrifices in order to send messages to their principal god, Zalmoxis. silver-gilt helmet of a Getic chieftain from the 4th century BC unearthed at Agighiol golden helmet of a Getic chieftain from the 4th century BC found at Co≈£ofene≈üti The \\"Ferigile- B√¢rse≈üti\\" group of cremation tumuli appeared in the foothills of the Southern Carpathians in this period. These graves yielded artifactspottery, weapons and jewelrywhich reveals the influence of Scythian, Illyrian and Thracian art on the locals. Greek amphorae found in the native settlements unearthed at Zimnicea and other places prove that the locals were involved in the trading of wine between the Greek colonies and the regions over the Carpathian Mountains. For instance, the natives at Priscu CrƒÉ≈üani used amphorae produced in the Aegean islands of Thasos, Rhodes and Cos. They lived in wattle-and-daub huts. Silver artifacts (including a helmet and a cup) from the princely tomb unearthed at Agighiol, and the gold helmet found at Co»õofƒÉne»ôti evidence the wealth accumulated by native chieftains through their connections with the Greek colonies in the 4th century BC. The \\"Getae beyond Haemus\\" who \\"border on the Scythians\\"The History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides (2.8), p. 100. paid tribute to the neighboring Odrysian kings in the 5th century BC, according to Thucydides. He adds that the Getae, who were mounted archers, supported King Sitalkes of the Odyssians against Athens in 429 BC. In 335 BC, according to Arrian, Alexander the Great launched a one-day raid across the Lower Danube against the Getae who could not prevent him from crossing the river. In connection with the raid, Arrian refers to \\"a deep cornfield\\" of the Getae and makes mention of their \\"poorly fortified\\" The Anabasis by Arrian (1.4), p. 7. city. After Alexander the Great's death, Lysimachus of Thrace ruled the northern regions of the Balkan Peninsula. He waged wars against King Dromichaetes of the Getae, but could not defeat him. The latter even captured Lysimachus and forced him to withdraw his troops from the lands between the Lower Danube and the Haemus in 292 BC. The subsequent history of Dromichaetes and his realm are unknown. According to the historian Vlad Georgescu, Dromichaetes's kingdom disintegrated into smaller polities. Inscriptions from Histria prove that in the 3rd century BC the Greeks paid tribute to local chieftains, including the Getic Zalmodegicus and Rhemaxos, in exchange for their protection against raids by other neighboring \\"barbarians\\". Syginnae The Syginnae, who had \\"small, short-faced, long-haired horses\\",Herodotus: The Histories (5.9), p. 306. according to Herodotus, were the bearers of the \\"Szentes-Vekerzug culture\\". This archaeological culture, which is featured by bridles and bits made of iron, flourished in the plains along the river Tisa from around 600 to the second half of the 4th century BC. The Syginnae's ethnic affiliation remained uncertain, but they were neither Thracians nor Scythians, according to the historian Timothy Taylor. Their territory was surrounded by rural settlements, including the villages of the \\"SanislƒÉu-Nir culture\\" in Cri≈üana, which suggests that the Syginnae were immigrants who forced the local population to accept their rule. Agathyrsi Herodotus writes that the Mure»ô River \\"rises in Agathyrsian territory\\",Herodotus: The Histories (4.48), p. 251. proving that this tribe of warriors dominated large territories in Transylvania in the late 5th century BC. Inhumation graves unearthed at Aiud, Blaj, Ciumbrud, and other sites along the rivers Mure»ô and T√¢rnava yielded artifacts, both metal work and pottery, with analogies in sites attributed to the Scythians in the Pontic steppes. However, the identification of the Agathyrsi as a Scythian tribe is controversial, because the making of their artifacts, especially their swords, found in Transylvania differs from the technique applied in the Pontic steppes. The Agathyrsi's \\"way of life\\" was actually \\"similar to that of the Thracians\\",Herodotus: The Histories (4.104), p. 270. as it was emphasized by Herodotus himself. Quivers decorated with metal crosses, mirrors and other featuring artifacts of the \\"Agathyrsian territory\\" appeared in the easternmost regions of the plains along the River Tisa around 500 BC, suggesting that the Agathyrsi expanded their rule over these territories in the subsequent century. Although Aristotle in his Problems still referred to the Agathyrsi, stating that they \\"sang their laws, so as not to forget them\\",Aristotle: Problems (19.28), p. 555. thereafter no written source makes mention of them. Their cemeteries ceased to be used around 350 BC. Whether the Agathyrsi were assimilated by other tribes, or abandoned their lands, cannot be decided. Celts The bronze helmet of Ciume≈üti from the early 3rd century BC In the period between 450 and 200 BC, the vast territory between the Atlantic Ocean and the Eastern Carpathians experienced the spread of the \\"La T√®ne culture\\". It is without doubt that this culture emerged in a Celtic-speaking population, but it cannot be decided whether its spread was only the consequence of migrations or acculturation also contributed to it. In Transylvania, the arrival of the Celts is exclusively evidenced by archaeological finds, because no documents refer to this event. Isolated graves yielding \\"La T√®ne\\" metalworkhelmets, weapons and horse harnessprove that the first Celtic groups settled in Cri≈üana and Transylvania after around 335 BC. \\"La T√®ne\\" settlements were consisted of semi-sunken huts, each with a nearby storage pit. Large \\"La T√®ne\\" cemeteries were unearthed, for instance, at Ciume≈üti, Orosfaia, and Pi≈ücolt. Their inhabitants practiced both inhumation and cremation burials, and in the latter case the ashes were placed into a pit or an urn. Their unearthed artifacts, mainly pottery, also point at the cohabitation of groups preserving different traditions in the same settlements. About 10% of the graves yielded weapons, proving the existence of a class of warriors. For instance, at Ciume≈üti a helmet decorated with a raven from the early 3rd century BC was found. \\"La T√®ne\\" cemeteries disappeared from Transylvania around 175 BC. Bastarnae The Bastarnae settled in the region between the rivers Siret and Dniester around 200 BC. According to Livy, their army crossed \\"the Danube with a large body of infantry and cavalry\\"Livy: Rome and the Mediterranean (40.57.2), p. 481. in 179 BC to support King Philip V of Macedonia in his wars in the Balkan Peninsula. Strabo, Pliny the Elder and Tacitus list them among the Germanic peoples, but the latter also writes that they intermarried with the nomad Sarmatians. Rustoiu identifies the Bastarnae as the bearers of the \\"Poiene≈üti‚ÄìLuka≈°ovka culture\\" of the regions to the east of the Carpathian Mountains, but this identification is not universally accepted. For instance, \\"Poiene≈üti‚ÄìLuka≈°ovka\\" settlements were inhabited by a sedentary population, but the historian Malcolm Todd says that the mobility of the Bastarnic warriors suggests that they were mustered by a nomad or semi- nomad people. Besides ceramics featuring the culture, \\"Poiene≈üti‚ÄìLuka≈°ovka\\" sites yielded pottery with analogies in Dacian and Celtic sites. Towards Roman occupation=Greek colonies The expansion of the Kingdom of Pontus under Mithridates VI ( 120‚Äì63 BC): (1) the kingdom before his reign (dark purple) (2) after his conquests (purple) (3) his conquests in the First Mithridatic War (89‚Äì85 BC) (pink) Callatis, Histria and Tomis accepted the suzerainty of King Mithridates VI of Pontus around 110 BC. His expansionist policy clashed with the interests of the Romans who had by that time started to advance in Southeastern Europe. The governor of the Roman province of Macedonia, Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus forced Callatis to sign a treaty of alliance with the Roman Empire in 72 or 71 BC. According to MacKendrick, it is plausible that Histria and Tomis concluded a similar treaty with the Romans around the same time, because the empire needed their ports for naval bases in the Black Sea. The three towns made an anti-Roman alliance with the Bastarnae, the Getae and other \\"barbarian\\" tribes in 61 BC. They inflicted a decisive defeat on the Roman armies which were under the command of Gaius Antonius Hybrida, Proconsul of Macedonia. King Burebista of the Dacians subjugated the three Greek colonies in about 50 BC. An inscription from the same time refers to the \\"second founding\\" of Histria, implying that it had been nearly destroyed during the previous wars. Callatis, Histria and Tomis regained their freedom after the death of Burebista in 44 BC. However, their independence became nominal and they accepted Roman protectorate after the expedition of 27 BC by Marcus Licinius Crassus in the lands between the Lower Danube and the Black Sea. The Roman poet, Ovid spent his last years in exile in Tomis between 9 and 17 AD. His poems evidence that barbarian attack was a constant menace for the townsfolk in this period. Dacians The earliest records of the Dacians are connected to their conflicts with the Roman Empire in the 2nd century BC. Strabo writes, in his Geographica, that their language \\"is the same as that of the Getae\\". He adds that the distinction between the Getae and the Dacians is based on their location: the Getae are \\"those who incline towards the Pontus and the east,\\" and the Dacians are \\"those who incline in the opposite direction towards Germany and the sources of the Ister\\". An iron sica or dagger and its scabbard from the 1st century BC unearthed at Cugir Archaeological findscremation graves yielding horse bits, curved daggers or sica, swords and other weaponsevidence the development of a military elite in the territories to the north of the Lower Danube in the 3rd-1st centuries BC. Tumuli with similar grave goods appeared in the same region and expanded towards southwest Transylvania and southern Moldavia from around 100 BC. The military character of the new elite is proven by the frequent raids against the neighboring territories, primarily in Thrace and Macedonia, from the 110s BC, which provoked counter-attacks by the Romans. For instance, Frontinus writes of Marcus Minucius Rufus's victory over \\"the Scordiscans and Dacians\\" in 109 BC, and Florus says that Gaius Scribonius Curio, Proconsul of Macedonia \\"reached Dacia, but shrank from its gloomy forests\\" in 74 BC. The kingdom of Burebista in the last years of his reign The native tribes of the wider region of the Lower Danube were for the first time united under King Burebista who ruled from around 80 or 70 BC. He defeated the Boii and the Taurisci, who dwelled in the Middle Danube region, around 60 BC, subdued the Scordisci and made plundering raids against Thracia, Illyricum and Macedonia in the subsequent years. In the middle of the 1st century BC, his empire was bordered by the Middle Danube, the Northern Carpathians, the Black Sea and the Balkan Mountains. Its center was located in the OrƒÉ≈ütie Mountains where Burebista had a number of fortifications erected. This forts were built by Greek craftsmen who introduced the use of chiseled stone. Strabo writes that Burebista \\"had as his coadjutor Deceneus, a wizard\\", who assisted him to stabilize his rule among the Dacians. Deceneus reformed the cult of Zalmoxis. He persuaded the Dacians \\"to cut down their vines and to live without wine\\", according to Strabo. The 6th-century historian, Jordanes, who preserved information originally recorded by Dio Chrysostom, writes that Deceneus \\"chose from among\\" the Dacians \\"those that were at that time of noblest birth and superior wisdom and taught them theology, bidding them worship certain divinities and holy places\\".The Gothic History of Jordanes (11:71), p. 71. These pilleates or tarabostes formed the ruling stratum of the Dacian society; the commoners were called capillati or comati. Strabo writes that Burebista \\"was deposed\\" during an uprising. The year of Burebista's fall cannot exactly be determined, but most historians write that he was assassinated in 44 BC. Strabo narrates that after Burebista's death his empire fall apart and four (later five) smaller polities developed in its ruins. The names of some of their kings were recorded by Roman writers. For instance, Dicomes, \\"the king of the Getae, promised to come and join\\" Mark Antony \\"with a great army\\", according to Plutarch. Ruins of Sarmizegetusa Regia, the capital of Decebalus A new empire dominated by the Dacians emerged in the reign of Decebalus who ruled from 87 AD. In the first year of his reign, he defeated a Roman army sent against Dacia in retaliation of a plundering raid in the Roman province of Moesia. Although the Romans defeated Decebalus in the Battle of Tapae in 88, he concluded a favorable peace treaty with the Roman Empire. It not only acknowledged Decebalus's status as rex amicus or client king, but the Romans also gave \\"large sums of money\\" to him \\"as well as artisans of every trade pertaining to both peace and war\\", according to Cassius Dio. Taking advantage of his treaty with the Romans, Decebalus improved the defenses of his kingdom. He also expanded his rule over the neighboring territories in the next decade. After these conquests, Decebalus's multiethnic empire was bordered by the Tisa, the Northern Carpathians, the Dniester and the Lower Danube, according to G√°bor V√©kony. Bastarnae Cassius Dio narrates that the Bastarnae \\"crossed the Ister and subdued the part of Moesia opposite them\\" in 29 or 28 BC. Marcus Licinius Crassus in short routed them. In the first decades of the next century, the Sarmatians who arrived from the Pontic steppes became the dominant power of the regions up to that time inhabited by the Bastarnae. Roman provinces and the neighboring tribes=Lower Moesia The year when the lands between the Lower Danube and the Black Sea, including the three Greek colonies of Callatis, Histria and Tomis, were annexed by the Roman Empire is uncertain. According to the historians Kurt W. Treptow and Marcel Popa, this happened in 46 AD. In contrast, Coriolan Hora≈£iu Opreanu writes that the territory was only integrated in the province of Moesia in the reign of Emperor Vespasianus (69‚Äì79). When Moesia was divided into two parts in 86, the territory became part of Lower Moesia. The new province was administered by former consuls who commanded two Roman legions, the Legio V Macedonica and the Legio I Italica. The region flourished under Antonius Pius who had the roads repaired. On the other hand, an inscription written in Greek from the village of Scraptopara evidences that the locals were complaining of the heavy taxation and the irksome duty of accommodating the Roman soldiers. The walls of Callatis and Tomis were reinforced after the Costoboci had marched through the region in 170. After the end of the Marcomannic War, Emperor Marcus Aurelius had 12,000 free Dacians settled in the province. Dacia Trajana Decebalus's suicide after the Romans' triumph in the Second Dacian War (a relief on Trajan's Column in Rome) The peaceful relationship between the Roman Empire and Decebalus's realm came to an end after Emperor Trajan ascended the throne in 98. He waged two wars against the Dacian king in the first decade of the 2nd century. After Trajan's First Dacian War, which lasted from 101 to 102, Decebalus was forced to approve of the stationement of Roman garrisons in Dacian territory, for instance at Drobeta, Romula and Tibiscum. During the Second Dacian War, the Romans annihilated the Dacian kingdom. Its core territoriesBanat, Oltenia and Transylvaniawere transformed into a new Roman province named Dacia in 106. The Romans also occupied Muntenia and the southern parts of Moldavia, which were annexed to the province of Moesia, but they withdrew from these territories in 119. Roman provinces in the regions now forming Romania in the 2nd century AD Under Emperor Trajan a procuratora former consulruled the province. He commanded two legions, the Legio XIII Gemina and the Legio IV Flavia Felix. The Roman territories to the north of the Lower Danube were divided into three provincesUpper Dacia, Lower Dacia, and Dacia Porolissensisin the reign of Emperor Hadrian. He also withdrew the Legion IV Flavia Felix from the province. Upper Dacia, where the only Roman legion stationed in the next century, was administered by former praetors; the two other provinces were ruled by governors from the ordo equester. During the Marcomannic Wars, a new legionthe Legio V Macedonicawas transferred to Dacia. Thereafter the two legions stationed in the three provincesnow named Dacia Apulensis, Dacia Malvensis, and Dacia Porolissensiswere under the command of a former consul, the Propraetor of the Three Dacias. Eutropius writes that Emperor Trajan transferred \\"vast numbers of people from all over the Roman world to inhabit the countryside and the cities\\", because \\"Dacia had, in fact, been depopulated\\"Eutropius: Breviarium (8.6.2.), p. 50. during the Second Dacian War. Indeed, inscriptions prove that the colonists came from many parts of the Roman Empire, but especially from Pannonia and Noricum. Although evidence of the presence of the natives after the establishment of the province is scarce, archeological sites at Boarta, Cernat, and other places in southern Transylvania prove the survival of rural communities. The exploitation of natural resourcesprimarily mining of copper, gold, iron, lead, salt, and silverhad a preeminent role in the economy of Dacia province. Archaeological research also revealed the existence of workshops producing pottery, weapons, glass for the local market. Roads built for military purposes also contributed to the development of long-distance trade. Dacia became subject of frequent plundering raids by the Carpi and other neighboring tribes from the 230s. Literary sourcesfor instance, Eutropiuseven recorded that \\"Dacia, which had been added beyond the Danube by Trajan, was lost\\"Eutropius: Breviarium (9.8.2.), p. 57. in the reign of Gallienus (260-268). From around 259, no inscriptions prove the presence of the two legions at their headquarters in Apulum and Potaissa. The Romans officially abandoned the province under Emperor Aurelius (270-275) who \\"led away both soldiers and provincials, giving up hope that it could be retained\\", according to the Historia Augusta. SarmatiansCostoboci Lipi≈£a\\" pottery (Archaeological Museum of Krak√≥w) The Costoboci were a free Dacian group mentioned in the 1st and 2nd centuries in Roman sources. Their territory\\"the land of the Costoboci\\", according to Cassius Diowere located northwest of Dacia province. According to the archaeologist Gheorghe Bichir, the Costoboci were the bearers of the \\"Lipi≈£a culture\\", but this identification has not been universally accepted by scholars. A Roman inscription recorded the name of a rex Coisstobocensis (\\"king of the Costoboci\\") Pieporus, suggesting that he was an ally of the empire. During the Marcomannic War, the Costoboci plundered the Roman provinces in the Eastern Balkans as far as Eleusis in 170. The governor or Dacia, Sextus Cornelius Clemens persuaded the Germanic Hasdingi to invade and occupy their land around 171. This was the last record of the Costoboci who disappeared from the sources. Gheorghe Bichir writes that many of them settled among the Carpi. Germanic tribes \\"Barbarian\\" invasions against the Roman Empire in the 3rd century The Marcomannic Wars, which lasted from 162 to 180, caused a series of population shifts along the eastern frontiers of the Roman Empire. The Buri were the first Germanic people who invaded Dacia. The governor of Dacia, Sabinianus defeated them in 180. Pottery and weapons featuring the \\"Przeworsk culture\\" appeared in Apa, Boine≈üti, Medie»ôu Aurit and other sites to the northwest of Dacia province in the last decades of the 2nd century. Their spread point at the arrival of the Hasdingi, who settled in these regions after their conquest of \\"the land of the Costoboci\\". \\"Przeworsk\\" pottery, weapons and other artifacts were also found at Roman forts in Dacia, suggesting a close contact between the German tribesmen and the Romans. A new enemy of the Roman Empire, the Goths emerged in the Pontic steppes in the first half of the 3rd century. According to their own tradition recorded by Jordanes, their migration from present-day Poland to the northern coasts of the Black Sea was a gradual process. Their first raid against the Roman Empire occurred in 238. They laid siege to Histria and forced the Romans to grant them an annual subsidy. Jordanes narrates that \\"some of the Taifali and Astringi, and also three thousands of the Carpi\\"The Gothic History of Jordanes (16:91), p. 77. joined the Goths during their invasion of Dacia and Moesia in 250, suggesting that the Goths had by that time become the predominant power among the tribes dwelling in the vicinity of the Roman Empire's Lower Danube frontier. Carpi The natives dwelling to the east of the Carpathians were collectively known as Carpi from the 3rd century. Written sources, inscriptions and literary works, evidence that the Carpi were a powerful enemy of the Roman Empire up until the 250s. For instance, Petrus Patricius recorded that they stated that they were \\"stronger than the Goths\\" when the Romans agreed to pay an annual tribute to the latter.

Early life and career After studying art and design at Konstfack and Beckmans in Stockholm, Sweden, Karin moved to New York City in 1946 to study fashion design at Parson's School of Design. There she married movie producer and director Rod E. Geiger who at the time was producing movies for Roberto Rossellini. Katja and her husband launched the Katja of Sweden brand in the late 1940s. Katja became close friends with Rosselini's wife Ingrid Bergman, and named a blouse after her that became a fashion hit. She was the designer for Arthur Sportswear which used contractors including those in the Bronx which employed 50 seamstresses turning out her products. Being close friends with Charlie Chaplin, and Edward Dmytryk who was one of the Hollywood Ten, the Hollywood blacklist ordeal got Mr. Geiger in hot water. The couple moved to Huar√∂d in Sweden in 1953, where the label \\"Katja of Sweden\\" became a fashion sensation which lasted for over twenty years. In 1975, they moved back to New York City, where Katja began designing home textiles, bed sheets, and kitchenware. \\"Katja shops\\" opened up in Macy's department store and Cannon Mills manufactured her designs under license.

It was painted in 1943 and is on display at Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris, France.  Description of Artwork  The piece reworked many themes that first occurred in Chagall's more famous artwork White Crucifixion whereby the suffering of Jewish victims of the Holocaust was communicated through the image of Jesus Christ as a Jew. Jesus is not the central image of this picture, and instead shares the canvas with a large green Torah scroll and angel. This positioning emphasises the Jewish character of Jesus in this work, supported by Jesus wearing a Jewish prayer shawl (tallit) and tefillin.J. Cohen. Christ Killers. Oxford. 2007. p.166 The surrounding details are scenes from the programs occurring in Europe. There is a burning shtetl to the right, surrounded by distressed looking figures. Below this is found a Jew wearing traditional Jewish clothing (and a placard) and a fleeing woman with her child. The latter scene is reminiscent of the story of Jesus‚Äô flight to Egypt as a child.The Bible. Matt. 2.13-15 Another theme that has been reworked into the Yellow Crucifixion, which first appeared in the White Crucifixion, is the presence of a ship. The significant difference is that in this painting, the ship is shown sinking into the waters. This is undoubtedly an allusion to the Struma disaster in 1942. The fact that Jesus is looking down on the ship, watching the passengers, is said to convey the artist's own passage to New York City from Europe that took place by ship.J. Cohen. Christ Killers. Oxford. 2007. p.166 Other details include fish leaping out of the sea and a goat.  Influence of Piece  Reformed theologian J√ºrgen Moltmann mentions this painting as being his muse while writing The Crucified God, a book which has been called a Christian theology after Auschwitz: \\"In front of me hangs Marc Chagall‚Äôs picture Crucifixion in Yellow. It shows the figure of the crucified Christ in an apocalyptic situation: people sinking into the sea, people homeless and in flight, and yellow fire blazing in the background. And with the crucified Christ there appears the angel with the trumpet and the open roll of the book of life [Rev 14.6]. This picture has accompanied me for a long time. It symbolizes the cross on the horizon of the world, and can be thought of as a symbolic expression of the studies which follow.\\" The Crucified God, xxii; See also Moltmann‚Äôs autobiography, A Broad Place, p.191 References Category:1943 paintings Category:Angels in art Category:Paintings depicting the Crucifixion of Jesus Category:Paintings by Marc Chagall Category:Fish in art Category:Goats in art Category:Ships in art Category:Collection of the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne Category:Musical instruments in art ","title":"The Yellow Crucifixion"},{"id":"41912925","text":"The Camp Gordon Johnston Museum is a historical museum of World War II history and artifacts.

A pioneer in the study of animal behaviour in the wild, Dagg is credited with being the first to study wild giraffes. Her impact on current understandings of giraffe biology and behaviour were the focus of the 2011 CBC radio documentary Wild Journey: The Anne Innis Story and the 2018 documentary film The Woman Who Loves Giraffes. In addition to her giraffe research, Dagg has published extensively about camels, primates, and Canadian wildlife, and she has raised concerns about the influence of sociobiology on how zoological research is shared with the general public. She has also researched and written extensively about gender bias in academia, drawing attention to the detrimental impact that anti-nepotism rules can have on the academic careers of the wives of male faculty members and to sexist academic work environments that fail to support female researchers. Early life and education Dagg was born on January 25, 1933 as Anne Christine Innis in Toronto, Ontario. Her father, Harold Innis, was a professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and her mother, Mary Quayle Innis, was an author of short stories and books about history. As a child Dagg attended Bishop Strachan School. She graduated from the University of Toronto in 1955 with a B.A. in Biology and was awarded a gold medal in recognition of her academic standing. She went on to earn a master's degree in Genetics from the University of Toronto. Following field research in Africa, Dagg began a PhD in Animal Behaviour at the University of Waterloo, completing her studies in 1967. Career Dagg's has published over 60 refereed scientific papers on such subjects as homosexuality, mammal behaviour, sociobiology, feminism, sexism at universities, and the rights of animals. She has also written 20 books on related topics.Dr. Anne Innis Dagg, Zoologist, Feminist, Author, annedagg.net Although best known for her research on the giraffe, Dagg has studied other animals including camels, primates, and Canadian wildlife. She has taught courses in mammology and wildlife management, among other topics, as an assistant professor with the Department of Zoology at the University of Guelph from 1968 to 1972. The remainder of her career was spent affiliated with the University of Waterloo's Integrated Studies program, later renamed Independent Studies. From 1986 to 1989 she served as the Academic Director of the program before transitioning to an academic advisor role. Dagg's interest in Canadian wildlife arose in the late 1960s while teaching a course at the University of Guelph. She was surprised to discover how little research had been done on smaller mammals and birds, in favour of research on big game species in Ontario and British Columbia such as the caribou. In 1972, she founded Otter Press in Waterloo, Ontario. The first publication was Matrix Optics by her husband Ian Dagg, followed in 1974 by her own book on Canadian wildlife, Mammals of Waterloo and South Wellington Counties, which was co-written by C. A. Campbell. Dagg has also written about the gendered framing of animal behaviour. In 1985, she raised concerns about the impact of sociobiology in scholarly publications and reporting to the general public about the social behaviour of animals in her book Harems and Other Horrors: Sexual Bias in Behavioral Biology. Of particular concern was what she noted as an increase in the anthropomorphizing of animal behaviour such as inaccurate, human-based, language to describe animal behaviour such as female mating behaviour being described as coy or flirtatious. In 1975, Dagg was recognized by the Museum of Natural History as part of an exhibit dedicated to their achievements in the natural sciences. Dagg was awarded the Batke Human Rights Award in 1984 by the K-W Status of Women in recognition of her work in the fields of social justice and gender equality. She received a Lane Anderson Award in 2017 in recognition of her non-fiction children's book 5 Giraffes, alongside author Caroline Fox. She donated the $10,000 prize that accompanied the award to giraffe conservation efforts. In 2019 Dagg was named an Honorary Member of the Canadian Society of Zoologists in recognition of her contributions to Canadian zoology. Despite demonstrated academic achievement, Dagg was denied tenure at the University of Guelph in 1972 due to concerns about her qualifications. Dagg claimed she was told by the Dean that she was denied tenure, in part, because she lived outside of Guelph with her family and wasn't involved in the community. Pointing to a strong research record, support from the student body, and the barring of women from participating on campus committees, Dagg called her treatment during the tenure review process \\"demoralizing\\" and framed the future of women in academia as \\"bleak\\" given the type of discrimination they face. Her academic ability was similarly questioned at the University of Waterloo where it was suggested there was no point in pursuing a position because she had a family and a husband to support them. Dagg's research on giraffes and her experiences in South Africa during apartheid were featured on the CBC's radio series Ideas as part of the 2011 documentary Wild Journey: The Anne Innis Story by Sandy Bourque. The documentary was heard by Alison Reid, who later directed the 2018 documentary The Woman Who Loves Giraffes, chronicling Dagg's life, career and her recognized impact on the study of giraffes. The film includes interviews with members of the tenure review committee that rejected Dagg's application. The chair of the committee, Keith Ronald, stood by the decision to deny Dagg tenure explaining that despite being a good teacher, Dagg's research program, which at the time included 20 peer-reviewed publications, \\"hadn't been fully developed\\". Fellow committee member Sandy Middleton, who also appeared in the film, disagreed, framing the rejection as a \\"grossly unfair\\" example of an old boys network at work and was likely motivated by jealousy of Dagg's early career success. Following the release of the film, the University of Guelph issued a formal apology to Dagg and established the Dr. Anne Innis Dagg Summer Research Scholarship aimed at supporting the research of undergraduate women studying zoology or biodiversity. On December 27, 2019, the office of Canadian Governor General Julie Payette announced that Dagg had been appointed a Member of the Order of Canada. Giraffe field research Male giraffes in South Africa. Dagg has been referred to as \\"the Jane Goodall of giraffes\\" and is recognized as having made significant contributions to the study of giraffes. Dagg first became interested in giraffes as a young child while visiting Illinois' Brookfield Zoo with her mother. During the mid-1950s Dagg traveled alone to South Africa to study the behavior of giraffes out of captivity. The trip was prompted by what she described in 1974 interview with the Toronto Star as a \\"tremendous urge to see giraffes roaming free, instead of being cooped up in zoos.\\" She contacted government officials in various African countries requesting permission to study the animal in their natural habitat and received only rejections, some noting the work wasn't a suitable undertaking for a woman. Ahead of the trip Dagg changed tactics by adjusting how her letters were signed. She contacted citrus farmer Alexander Matthew, who owned land near Kruger National Park in close proximity to roaming giraffes, to ask for permission to visit and study giraffes. Her request was granted based on the Matthew's assumption that the letter, signed A. Innis, was written by a man. Upon Dagg's arrival he told her she would have to return to Canada because allowing her to bunk with the male farmhands was, for him, out of the question. Rather than returning home she travelled to Grahamstown where she spent her time researching giraffes at the Rhodes University library. She began writing to Matthew multiple times a week for several weeks asking for permission to return. He eventually agreed, allowing her to stay in his family's home in exchange for clerical services over the course of her stay. In turn, Dagg was given access to 33,000 hectors of groves and bush frequented by 95 giraffes. Dagg spent upward of ten hours a day in the field taking extensive notes about all aspects of giraffe behaviour, including what they ate and how they interacted, and was the first to note male giraffes engaging in homosexual behaviour. In addition to her research at Fleur de Lys, she travelled to Tanganyika and Kenya to observe other giraffe populations over the course of her stay. Her research marked the first time a scientist set out to study giraffes in the wild. In 1965, due to the unique nature of her research, she was invited to appear on the American television show To Tell the Truth. Upon returning to Canada, she began PhD in animal behaviour at the University of Waterloo, which she completed in 1967 under the supervision of Anton de Vos. Her thesis work analyzed and compared the gaits of giraffe and other large mammals. Dagg's field research was eventually published in The Giraffe: Its Biology, Behavior and Ecology (1976). Co-authored with ecologist J. Bristol Foster, the book is recognized by researchers as the foundational text on giraffes. Gender inequality in academia During her PhD studies, Dagg attempted to secure employment as a professor, but found that at the time universities weren't inclined to hire women. Dagg's experience as a woman in academia would go on to shape her work and research interests for the remainder of her career. She has researched and published about anti-nepotism laws at academic institutions in North America arguing that they disproportionately impact the female spouses of male professors. According to Dagg, anti-nepotism rules, whether formal or unspoken, combined with a reluctance by universities to hire their own PhD students doubly hindered the wives of male faculty: \\"A wife often earns a Ph.D. from the local university where she is then unable to become a professor because of this opposition. Unlike many other women, she may not be free because of her marriage to seek a position at a university outside her locale, a dilemma which makes her career vulnerable to the local university's policies.\\" In 1974, Dagg filed a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission against Wilfrid Laurier University. The complaint was in regards to the school's refusal to interview her for a position in their biology department despite 19 years experience, opting to instead hire a male professor whom she claimed had less experience and fewer qualifications. Dagg requested a formal review of the complaint by Ontario's Ombudsman after the Commission found that her claims were \\"absolutely without foundation.\\" Dagg further explored the experiences of women in academia in the 1988 book MisEducation: Women & Canadian Universities, co-authored with Patricia J. Thompson. The authors pointed to a reliance on course material and textbooks reliant on gender-based stereotypes, male co-workers making sexist jokes, and lack of support or funding for women researchers as example of how conditions at Canadian universities hadn't changed much for women over time. In a Globe and Mail interview, Dagg, who at the time had published 10 books and more than 50 scholarly articles, said about the book that she hoped her lack of tenure wouldn't cost her her job. Personal life Dagg married Ian Ralph Dagg (1928-1993) in 1957. The ceremony took place at St. Pancras Town Hall in London, England. Ian Dagg taught at the University of Waterloo's Physics Department from 1959 to 1993, and served as chair of the department from 1988 to 1993.I. R. Dagg Memorial Scholarship, Undergraduate Studies Calendar, U. of Waterloo Together until his death, the couple had three children: Hugh, Ian and Mary. Bibliography=Books * *With J.

While many black Americans use names that are popular with wider American culture, a number of specific naming trends have emerged within African-American culture. Sources include French names, Arabic names and Muslim names, as well as other European and Biblical names. History It is widely held that prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European-American culture. Even within the White-American population, most babies of that era were given a few very common names, with children given nicknames to distinguish the various people with the same name. It was also quite common for immigrants and cultural minorities to choose baby names or change their names to fit in within the wider American culture. This applied to both given names and surnames. Although most consider distinctively Black names only a recent phenomenon, recent claims by Cook et al. has alleged the use of distinctive names by Black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Cook L, Logan T, Parman J. Distinctively black names in the American past. Explor Econ Hist. 2014 Jul;53:64‚Äì82. However, those early names are no longer used by Black people. In fact, Paustian has argued that Black names display the same themes and patterns as those in West Africa.Paustian PR. The Evolution of Personal Naming Practices among American Blacks' Names. 1978 Jul 19;26(2):177‚Äì91. With the rise of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement and the wider counterculture of the 1960s, there was a dramatic rise in African-American names of various origins. San Diego State University professor Jean Twenge believes that the shift toward unique Black-American baby names is also the result of the cultural shift in America that values individuality over conformity. In 2004, Fryer et al. examined the rapid change in naming practices in the early 1970s, with the rapid adoption of distinctively Black names, especially in low-income, racially isolated neighborhoods.Fryer RG, Levitt SD. \\"The Causes and Consequences of Distinctively Black Names\\". Q J Econ. 2004;119(3):767‚Äì805. They favor an explanatory model which attributes a change in Black perceptions of their identity to the Black Power Movement. Influences and conventions Lieberson and Mikelson of Harvard University analyzed Black names, finding that the recent innovative naming practices follow American linguistic conventions even if they are independent of organizations or institutions.Lieberson S, Mikelson K. \\"Distinctive African American Names: An Experimental, Historical, and Linguistic Analysis of Innovation\\". Am Sociol Rev. 1995 Dec;60(6):928‚Äì46.  French names  While creoles of color historically had classical French names, many names of French origin entered the picture during the 1950s and 1960s. Opinions on the origins of the French influence vary, but historically French names such as Monique, Chantal, Andr√©, and Antoine became so common within African-American culture that many Americans began to think of them solely as \\"Black names\\". These names are often seen with spelling variations such as Antwan (Antoine) or Shauntelle (Chantal).  Afrocentric and inventive names Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal. Shaquille, shortened to \\"Shaq\\", is an example of an invented African- American spelling of the name Shakil. The Afrocentrism movement that grew in popularity during the 1970s saw the advent of African names among African- Americans, as well as names imagined to be African sounding. Names such as Ashanti have African origins. The Black Power movement inspired many to show pride in their heritage. Harvard University sociologist Stanley Lieberson noted that in 1977, the name \\"Kizzy\\" rose dramatically in popularity following the use of the name in the book and television series Roots. By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common within African-American culture to invent new names. Many of the invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re, or Ja/Je and suffixes such as -ique/iqua, -isha, -ari, and -aun/-awn are common, as well as inventive spellings for common names. The book Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool‚ÄîThe Very Last Word on First Names places the origins of \\"La\\" names in African- American culture in New Orleans. The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin but has elements drawn from both French and African roots. Other names‚Äîfor example, LaTanisha, DeShawn, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua‚Äîwere created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre. In his dictionary of Black names, Cenoura asserts that in the early 21st century, Black names are \\"unique names that come from combinations of two or more names, names constructed with common prefixes and suffixes...'conjugated' with a formula...\\"Cenoura B. Black. Names Matter: The Black Names Book. Bobby Cenoura and Slice of Pain Publishing and Media; 2015. 394 p. \\"Da\\", \\"La\\", and related sounds may originate from the French spoken in Louisiana. Attached to a common name such as Sean and spelled phonetically, one obtains \\"DaShawn\\". Diminutive suffixes from French, Spanish and Scottish such as \\"ita\\" may be combined directly with prefixes or to a name, as is often found in white naming or nicknaming. Conventions followed usually make the person's gender easily identifiable. Following Spanish, masculine names often end in \\"o\\", e.g. \\"Carmello\\", while feminine names end with \\"a\\", e.g. \\"Jeretta\\". Following Irish, French and Italian, apostrophes may be used, e.g. \\"D'Andre\\" and \\"Rene'e\\". Parents' names may be blended, e.g. the son of \\"Raymond\\" and \\"Yvonne\\" might be named \\"Rayvon\\".  Muslim names  Muhammad Ali's name change from Cassius Clay in 1964 helped inspire the popularity of Muslim names within African-American culture. Islam has been an influence upon African-American names. Islamic names entered African-American culture with the rise of The Nation of Islam among Black Americans with its focus upon Black advocacy. The popular names Aisha, Aaliyah,entry for \\"Aaliya\\" in English, at BehindTheName. and others are also examples of names derived from Islam. A number of African-American celebrities began adopting Muslim names, including Muhammad Ali, who changed his name in 1964 from Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. Other celebrities adopting Muslim names include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (formerly Lew Alcindor) and Amiri Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones). Despite the Muslim origin of these names and the place of the Nation of Islam in the Civil Rights Movement, many Muslim names such as Jamal and Malik entered popular usage among Black Americans simply because they were fashionable, and many Islamic names are now commonly used by African Americans regardless of religion. European and Biblical names Even with the rise of created names, it is also still common for African Americans to use biblical, historic, or European names. Daniel, Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were among the most common names for African-American boys in 2013.

Life  Jauss was the eldest of six children born to Anna Maria and Leopold Jauss (a mason and farmer). From 1873 to 1880, he attended the elementary school in Hattenhofen, where the Pastor discovered that he had talent for drawing and arranged for him to take lessons at G√∂ppingen.Georg Jauss.de, timeline In 1883, he became a fellow at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Stuttgart. Jakob Gr√ºnenwald was one of his instructors; his fellow students included Christian Landenberger and Bernhard Buttersack. He took a study trip to Italy in the summer of 1890 and, after his military service, went to the Dachau District where his interests changed from genre painting to landscapes. In 1895, he became a teacher at the Munich Association of Women Artists and joined the Munich Secession but, only four years later, resigned Association and disassociated himself from the Secession. From 1906 to 1913, he was a member of the Luitpold Group, an association of slightly modernist tendencies that promoted high-quality art, then he returned to the Secession.

Shurtleff, Civil No. 2:05CV000485 (D. Utah 2012), was a case in which the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah issued an order stating that individuals could not be prosecuted for posting adult content that was constitutionally protected on general access websites, nor could they be civilly liable for failing to prevent access to adult content, so long as the material is identifiable by filtering software. The order was the result of a 2005 lawsuit, The King‚Äôs English v. Shurtleff, brought by Utah bookstores, artists, Internet Service Providers and the other organizations challenging the constitutionality of certain portions of a Utah Law intended to protect minors from adult content. Background=Facts In March 2005, House Bill 260, amending and adding to the Utah Harmful to Minors Act, was passed by the Utah legislature and signed into law by Governor Jon Huntsman. The bill sought to \\"address pornographic material and material harmful to minors.\\" Among other provisions, the bill required the Utah Attorney General to maintain an \\"adult content registry\\" of internet websites that contained material deemed \\"harmful to minors.\\" The bill correspondingly required Internet service providers (\\"ISPs\\") to block access or provide filtering software for these websites. It also stated that Utah ISPs must properly label or block their content, with criminal and civil penalties on those who failed to do so. In response to the Bill, an umbrella of organizations including Utah based bookstores, Internet Service Providers, the ACLU of Utah, Media Coalition and the Center for Democracy & Technology filed a federal lawsuit on June 9, 2005. The suit challenged the constitutionality of the bill under the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the Commerce Clause. This lawsuit was originally known as The King‚Äôs English v. Shurtleff for a Utah bookshop named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.  Procedural Posture  U.S. District Court Judge Dee Benson granted a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the law on August 25, 2006. In response to the State of Utah's motion to dismiss for lack of standing, Judge Benson ruled on plaintiff's legal standing on November 29, 2007, finding that while the majority of the plaintiffs had standing, The King's English bookstore and other similar organizations did not. The judge denied plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, and the case was subsequently captioned as \\"Nathan Florence v. Shurtleff,\\" now named for Florence, who was a Utah painter who depicted nudes in some of his works. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on June 8, 2011, seeking to enforce the injunction against HB 260 on a permanent basis. The State of Utah responded on July 29, 2011 with a combined brief opposing plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and supporting its own motion for summary judgment and motion to dismiss for lack of standing. The judge heard arguments on plaintiff's motion to dismiss on April 12, 2012. On May 17, 2012 Judge Benson issued an order and declaratory judgment ruling that individuals and service providers could not be prosecuted under Section 1206 of the bill for making constitutionally protected adult content available on general access websites, and could not be subject to civil or criminal penalties under Section 1233 for failing to filter or block access to this content. Complaint Plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on June 9, 2005, citing concerns of censorship, free speech and violations of the Commerce Clause. The Complaint challenged most of the act, apart from Sections 1 and 3. It specifically identified 5 provisions of the Act, which were challenged on constitutional bases: # Section 5 of the Act, which sought to extend the existing Utah law on materials harmful to minors (Utah Code ¬ß 76-10-1206) to Internet content providers and ISPs. # Section 9, or the Mandatory Labeling provision, which stated that Utah-based content providers were required to label their content, and imposed criminal penalties for failing to do so. # Section 2, which mandated the creation of an \\"adult content registry\\" by Attorney General Shurtleff, consisting of a list of websites that he identified as containing material \\"harmful to minors.\\" Section 8, which correspondingly required ISPs to block access to websites that were listed in the registry. # Section 4, which required ISPs to block or restrict access to \\"pornographic material\\" as determined by their customers. # Section 7, which broadly required ISPs to restrict access to material \\"harmful to minors.\\" The plaintiffs argued that due to the \\"technical realities\\" of the Internet, it would be difficult for large ISPs to restrict access for one set of customers, and would instead result in restricting access across the network, and to non- requesting customers as well. The complaint also cited various cases in which courts in Michigan, New York, Arizona, and other states had struck down laws applying criminal penalties for \\"distributing harmful materials to minors\\" to the internet as unconstitutional, including the United States Supreme Court case Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union which struck down a federal version of the law on First Amendment Grounds. It identified a Pennsylvania state case, Center for Democracy & Technology v. Pappert where the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania struck down a state law requiring ISPs to restrict access to specific websites, on First Amendment and Commerce Clause claims. The complaint also contained declarations from various organizations and individuals, including The King's English bookstore, Nathan Florence and the ACLU of Utah explaining the adverse impact of the law on their business. Constitutional Claims Plaintiffs identified 8 causes of action in the complaint: *Count 1 - Violation of Adults' Rights under the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution: Stated that the law was unconstitutional \\"on its face\\" as it imposed unfair restrictions and burdens upon constitutionally protected speech between adults. *Count 2 - Violation of Minors' Rights Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution: Stated that the law prevented minors from lawfully accessing content that was protected by the First Amendment. *Count 3 - Prior Restraint: Stated that the law deprived Plaintiffs of their ability to access and publish content to the Internet that was protected by the First Amendment. *Count 4 - Inadequate Procedures: Stated that the law did not provide ISPs and other organizations with adequate procedural protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. *Count 5 - Violation of the Right to Communicate and Access Information Anonymously Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution: Stated that in requiring users to identify themselves as adults in order to access protected content, the Act violated users' rights to anonymity under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. *Count 6 - Compelled Speech: Stated that Section 9 compelled Utah based content providers to label their speech as \\"adult content\\" in violation of the First Amendment. *Count 7 - Violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution: Stated that the Act violated the interstate commerce provision of the Commerce Clause, as it subjected ISPs to \\"inconsistent regulations\\" that impacted out of state users. Under their prayer for relief, plaintiffs sought a preliminary as well as permanent injunction against the State from enforcing the enumerated provisions, due to their constitutional violations, and the fact that under strict scrutiny the infringement of plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were not justified by a compelling government purpose.  State's Response  The State of Utah, in response, argued that the law was vital to apprehend sexual predators, citing the use of Internet chatrooms and other websites. It stated that the law was designed to aid its longstanding Internet Crimes Against Children taskforce. It also stated that since the law applied in large part to ISPs, bookstores and individuals did not have standing to challenge the law. The State sought to differentiate HB 260 from the law at issue in Reno v. ACLU, arguing that this law was narrower, as it explicitly identified \\"harmful websites\\" through the tagging system in the adult content registry. This process, according to the State, was designed to facilitate ISPs in their blocking and filtering processes, by giving them a defined field. Defendants stated that the requirement for ISPs to provide their customers with filtering mechanisms for \\"pornographic materials\\" was the most effective means of preventing minors from accessing pornography on the internet. Utah further argued that the filtering requirement ensured that the law was narrowly tailored in order to achieve a \\"compelling government interest.\\" The State cited cases such as Sable Communications of California v. FCC and Ginsberg v. New York to argue that the law would withstand strict scrutiny, as states had a compelling interest in \\"protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors\\" and were therefore permitted to \\"regulate material that is indecent with respect to minors.\\"  Declaratory Judgment  Judge Dee Benson issued an order and declaratory judgment on May 15, 2012. The judge held that individuals and organizations could not be prosecuted under Section 1206 for posting constitutionally protected content on general access websites, and that they were not subject to criminal and civil penalties under Section 1233 for a failure to label, or restrict access to their material. Around this time, Plaintiffs worked with Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff on the implementation and enforcement of the law.Media Coalition, Florence v. Shurtleff (May 19, 2012), http://mediacoalition.org/the-kings-english-v- shurtleff-2/  Impact  The case was hailed as a \\"crucial victory for free speech,\\" by the Media Coalition, while the ACLU stated that this order \\"...removes the cloud cast over internet speech that Utah's broadly worded statute had created,\\" and the Center for Democracy and Technology stated that the judgment brought \\"...Utah law into line with 15 years of legal precedent protecting the constitutional rights of adults to access lawful content online.\\" See also *Children's Internet Protection Act *Nitke v.

Along with General Mohamed Medbouh he instigated an attempted coup against king Hassan II on 10 July 1971. M'hamed Ababou was the director of the Ahermoumou military non-commissioned officer training school. Acting under his orders, about 1,200 cadets from the school seized the Royal summer palace at Skhirat where a diplomatic function was being held to celebrate the King's forty-second birthday. Foreign and Moroccan VIPs were held under guard or fled along the nearby seafront. Approximately 100 guests, officials, servants and cadets were reported killed under confused circumstances. It was to be subsequently claimed that the young cadets had been told by Ababou and other officers that they were acting to protect King Hassan against rebels. Initially the only loyalist troops present at the palace were ceremonial guards and the king took refuge in a pavilion annex. Ababou was killed on the day of the coup during an exchange of fire with royal troops led by General Bouhali, who had been dispatched to the palace to rescue the king. It is reported that Ababou was only wounded in this clash but had asked a fellow conspirator to shoot him so that he would not be taken alive. M'hamed Ababou had two brothers in the military; Mohamed (his elder by 4 years) with whom he co-organized the attempted coup and who would die in detention in 1976; and a younger brother named Abdelziz Ababou who died during the coup itself.

She is best known for her Depression-era post office murals commissioned by the United States Department of the Treasury. Early life and education Natalie Smith Henry was the first of five children born to Natalie Smith and Samuel Ewell Henry, a circuit clerk and Hot Spring County judge. Henry‚Äôs interest in art first began at age twelve following the death of her mother. Although her interest began as a creative way to channel her grief, at age fifteen Henry began formally studying illustration at the International Correspondence Schools of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Following her graduation from Malvern High School in 1925, Henry attended Galloway College before moving to Illinois in 1928 to attend the prestigious School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1937, after taking classes part-time for several years, Henry finally earned a four-year degree from the Hubert Ropp School of Art. Henry paid her school tuition by serving as Ropp's recordkeeper and working part-time as a typist at the Ryerson Library from 1931 to 1942. Career Henry first began displaying her work at a national level in 1935, when she exhibited Picnic at the Annual Exhibition of Artists of Chicago and Vicinity. The following year, Man with Shells was shown alongside the work of notable European and American artists Wassily Kandinsky, Edward Hopper, and Wood. In addition to her part-time work as an artist, Henry also contributed to the Federal Art Project of the Works Project Administration by producing murals for private clients. In 1939 the Section of Painting and Sculpture of the United States Department of the Treasury commissioned her to paint a mural for the Springdale, Arkansas Post Office. This mural, titled Local Industries, was well received by those suffering from the effects of the Great Depression. In 1944, Henry joined the Chicago Society of Artists and annually submitted work there until 1987. Throughout her career, her work was exhibited in galleries throughout Chicago, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Society of Artists, the Chicago Women's Salon, and The Renaissance Society. Despite her artistic success, the unmarried Henry still struggled financially. After several years of part-time secretarial positions, Henry worked for Office of Price Administration‚ÄìRent Division from 1942 to 1943. After working in commercial art from 1943 to 1948, Henry became the manager of the Art Institute of Chicago School Store, a position she held until 1972. During her time as manager, Henry also earned money by designing woodblocks and making greeting cards for the Chicago Society of Artists. For many years Henry shared an apartment with Rowena Fry at the Lambert Tree Studios building, and Henry depicted her in the watercolor Rowena Washing Her Hair sometime during the 1930s. Death and legacy Henry returned to her hometown of Malvern, Arkansas in 1985 and remained there until her death in 1992. Fry came to live with her in 1989, dying the next year. Currently, her works are held in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. and the Shiloh Museum of Ozark History in Springdale, Arkansas.

Only a few were produced. Design and development The K 10 is a cantilever shoulder wing glider with a single spar wing built from pine and plywood. Its covering is mostly fabric but glass fibre is used in places where the surface has double curvature. Airfoils by F.X. Wortmann replaced the NACA 63 series profiles of the successful Schleicher Ka 6 with the intention of producing higher speeds. The leading edge is straight and unswept, but a swept trailing edge produces a forward sweep at quarter chord of 1.2¬∞. There is 3¬∞ of dihedral. The taper increases slightly on the outer wing panels, where ply covered ailerons are hinged on the upper wing surfaces. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are fitted inboard. Its fuselage is a ply shell formed around wooden bulkheads and stringers and again GRP is used for areas with double curvature. The cockpit is enclosed by a moulded Perspex canopy. The tail surfaces are straight tapered and built in the same way as the wings. It has all-moving elevators mounted on the fin at the top of the fuselage, far enough forward that only a small cut out was required for movement of the fabric covered rudder, which extends down to the keel. The K 10 has a fixed, semi-recessed monowheel undercarriage assisted by a tail skid. The K 10 made its first flight in August 1963. The Wortmann profiles did improve high speed performance but the K 10 lost the excellent low-speed handling characteristics of the Ka 6, so only twelve K 10s were built and Kaiser's attention turned to producing an improved Ka 6, the Ka 6E, which adopted the all-moving tailplane of the K 10 but used the earlier NACA airfoils. Three K 10s remained on the German civil aircraft register in 2010. A Swiss registered K 10 crashed fatally in 1999.

He had since been active as an actor and stage director, among others at Studio am Montag, Bern; Bern Theatre; Kom√∂die D√ºsseldorf; Kammerspiele D√ºsseldorf. He maintained links to the theatre world throughout his career, but his work received more acceptance within the performance art circuit, and Klassen identified himself primarily as a performance artist. He was inspired by Fluxus and Living Theatre. In his first performance, My Red Brother, Klassen sat at a table holding a cigarette and watching the smoke rise, an action that he repeated in his performances through the years. Klassen had a black star tattooed on this bald head. The tattoo was result of a performance in homage to John Cage and Marcel Duchamp. This performance consisted in the action of the artist having his head tattooed inside a train station in 2008.. Shannon Cochrane (2011) Total Art Journal. ‚ÄúNorbert Klassen.

He participated in numerous events by the international performance art network around the world. Together with Gerhard Johann Lischka, Peter J. Betts, Rudolf Bober and others, Klassen founded the independent theatre collective Studio am Montag for experimental theatre in Bern in 1970, and run it in the position of director from 1971-87. The collective presented its productions in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. Their activities were funded by the City of Bern. In 1979/80, Klassen lived for one year in New York City. Between 1980 and 1997, Klassen held a teaching position at the Schauspielschule am Konservatorium f√ºr Musik und Theater Bern, and from 1987 to 1995 he taught at the F+F School for Art and Media Design Zurich. In 1987, Studio am Montag transformed into STOP Performance Theater (STOP.P.T.). On this occasion, Klassen announced the ‚Äûdeath of theatre‚Äú, and postulated performance art as the only adequate artistic succession. In 1992, Klassen received the Sisyphus-Prize awarded by the City of Bern. He returned the prize in 1995 as a protest against the drastic reduction of city subventions for the STOP Performance Theater (STOP.P.T.).

Stotherd (1796‚Äì1879), colonel commandant Royal Engineers, by his first wife, Elizabeth Sydney (died 1853), daughter of Hugh Boyle, of Dungiven, County Londonderry, he was born at Angler Castle, County Tyrone, on 25 November 1828. His father, who came of a Lincolnshire family, worked on the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, and was promoted general 19 June 1872. Educated at University College school, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Stotherd received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 2 May 1847, and first lieutenant on 28 October. He went through the usual course of professional study at Chatham, and then served at Woolwich and at Gibraltar. On his return home he was posted to the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain and sent to Dumfries. He was promoted to be second captain on 21 May 1855, and first captain on 17 May 1860. Leaving the Ordnance Survey in 1861, Stotherd went to Weymouth, and then, at time of the Trent affair, to North America, where he acted as brigade major and assistant to the commanding Royal Engineer, serving four years in Canada and New Brunswick. On Stotherd's return to England on 13 February 1866 he was appointed instructor in electricity, chemistry, and photography at the school of military engineering at Chatham. There he was an early investigator of the application of electricity to mining and naval mines, and he also organised the first field telegraph. He was sent to the 1867 Paris Exhibition to report on military telegraphs. In 1868 Prince Arthur was under his instruction. While at Chatham, Stotherd advocated Morse code for army signalling. He was promoted to be brevet major on 22 November 1870, regimental major on 5 July 1872, and regimental lieutenant-colonel on 3 August 1872. In 1871 Stotherd accompanied Colonel Charles Cornwallis Chesney to report on the Franco-Prussian war, the siege of Paris and the operations against the Paris Commune. In April 1873 he was appointed to the War Office in London, to advise on the subject of submarine mines and of military telegraphs. He was from 1873 to 1876 president of the first war office torpedo committee. In 1876 Stotherd was appointed commanding Royal Engineer of the Belfast military district, where he remained for five years. He was promoted to be brevet colonel on 3 August 1877, and regimental colonel on 26 April 1882. In September 1881 he was appointed to the charge of the Ordnance Survey in Ireland, residing at the Mountjoy Barracks, Phoenix Park, Dublin. After the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish, Stotherd acted as a military justice of the peace for the city of Dublin, in charge of troops in aid of the civil power. On 1 April 1883 Stotherd was appointed director-general of the Ordnance Survey of the United Kingdom, and went to its headquarters at Southampton. The staff had grown under his predecessor, Lieutenant-General Anthony Charles Cooke. A parliamentary select committee of 1878 had recommended that the original large-scale surveys should be completed in 1890, instead of 1900. Stotherd urged a systematic revision on the government. In 1884 he saw to maps for the Redistribution of Seats Bill, and was officially thanked by being made CB On 25 November 1886 Stotherd was compelled by the age rule to retire from the army and from his appointment, receiving the honorary rank of major-general. He died suddenly, from heart disease, on 1 May 1895 at Camberley, Surrey, where he resided. Works Stotherd contributed articles to The Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers, vols. xvii. and xviii., and was the author of the first text-book published in England on its subject, Notes on Defence by Submarine Mines, Brompton, Kent; the second edition was dated 1873. Family Stotherd was first married on 11 June 1861, at St. George's, Hanover Square, London, to Caroline Frances Wood (died 17 February 1872), by whom he had a large family; and secondly, on 29 September 1875, at Edinburgh, Elizabeth Janet Melville, who survived him.

Odd-chain fatty acids are those fatty acids that contain an odd number of carbon atoms. Most fatty acids are even chain, e.g. stearic (C16) and oleic (C18). So in addition to being classified according to their saturation of unsaturation, fatty acids are also classified according to the odd vs. even numbers of constituent carbon atoms. In terms of physical properties, odd and even fatty acids are similar, generally being colorless, soluble in alcohols, and often somewhat oily. On a molecular level, the odd- chain fatty acids are biosynthesized and metabolized slightly differently from the even-chained relatives. In addition to the usual C12-C22 long chain fatty acids, some very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are also known. Some of these VLCFAs are also of the odd-chain variety. Biosynthesis  Nervonic acid is a monounsaturated odd-chain fatty acid, which serves as a biomarker for certain human disorders. The most common OCFA are the saturated C15 and C17 derivatives, respectively pentadecanoic acid and heptadecanoic acid. The synthesis of even-chained fatty acid synthesis is done by assembling acetyl- CoA precursors. Because the segments are each two carbons in length the resulting fatty acid has an even number of carbon atoms in it. However, propionyl-CoA instead of acetyl-CoA is used as the primer for the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms. Metabolism Oxidation of odd-carbon fatty acids requires three additional enzymes. The first is propionyl-Coa carboxylase. This enzyme is responsible for carboxylating the Œ±-carbon of a Propionyl-CoA to produce D-methylmalonyl-CoA. After this, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase carries out an isomerization reaction. Specifically, the D-isomer produced by the carboxylase reaction is transformed into the L-isomer of Methylmalonyl-CoA. This is a recently discovered enzyme, it was researched during the late 1900s and the first publication was in 1961. Researchers concluded that there was indeed an racemic reaction prior to reaching succinyl-CoA. To reach Succinyl-CoA, the L-Isomer of the if Methylmalonyl-Coa is used as a substrate by Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. This reaction is essentially a switch in positions between the carboxylated Œ±-Carbon and the Œ≤-Carbon. For this reaction to take place, the enzyme works with a cofactor known as a Vitamin B12, allowing the mechanism to take place through a free radical mechanism. With these three reactions completed to success, the fatty acid is allowed to continue through normal Œ≤-Oxidation rounds. Occurrence OCFAs are found particularly in ruminant fat and milk (e.g. heptadecanoic acid). Some plant-based fatty acids, also have an odd number of carbon atoms, and Phytanic fatty acid absorbed from the plant chlorophyll has multiple methyl branch points. As a result, it breaks down into three odd-numbered 3C Propionyl segments as well as three even-numbered 2C Acetyl segments and one even numbered 4C Isobutynoyl segment. In humans, in sharp contrast to butyrate and octanoate, the odd-chain SCFA, propionate, has no inhibitory effect on glycolysis and does not stimulate ketogenesis. Odd- chain and branched-chain fatty acids, which form propionyl-CoA, can serve as minor precursors for gluconeogenesis.

Bennett (May 2, 1853 ‚Äì February 8, 1933) was an American journalist, magazine publisher and politician who served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and as a member of the Everett, Massachusetts Board of Selectmen. Early life Bennett was born to Levi W. Bennett and Kezia C. Bennett on May 2, 1853 in the North Cambridge neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts. When he was young, Bennett's family moved to South Malden, Massachusetts (later known as Everett). He attended public schools in Malden and graduated from Chelsea High School in 1870. Publishing Bennett's involvement in publishing began when he worked for newspapers in Boston. He then traveled the country as a journeyman printer and established a small newspaper in Northern Michigan. He later returned to Boston to work for Curtis Guild, Sr. (father of Governor Curtis Guild, Jr.), who published the market edition of the Boston Commercial Bulletin. He then worked for the Boston Daily Advertiser as an editorial writer. He was widely known for his writings on finance and tariffs. In 1887, Bennett retired from the Advertiser. He founded Frank P. Bennett & Co., which published trade papers, including the American Wool Reporter, later known as the American Wood and Cotton Reporter. In 1891, the company launched the financial publication United States Investor. Along with publishing the magazine, the firm also established an investment information service, run by his son Frank P. Bennett. Jr., that performed research for a fee. In 1895, Bennett's firm was sued by the New York-based William B. Dana Company, which charged that United States Investor's new financial supplement consisted largely of copyrighted content from Dana's The Commercial and Financial Chronicle. \\"The Chronicle's injunction was granted [by the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts], protecting the copyright. The case is considered an important one because it has been deemed almost impossible heretofore to protect publications like those of The Chronicle,\\" wrote the Library of Congress' Copyright Office in 1980. United States Investor was published at least through 1921. Political offices=Everett From 1886 to 1887 Bennett served as a member of the Everett Board of Selectmen. Bennett was a Republican member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives representing Everett from 1891 to 1894. During his tenure in the House, Bennett was gained a reputation for determinedly opposing any policy he found questionable. Saugus In 1894, Bennett moved to Saugus, Massachusetts, and soon became active in town affairs. He served as Town Moderator and on the Board of Selectmen and School Committee. In 1898 he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was a candidate for Speaker of the House in 1900. He ran an aggressive campaign for the position, but was defeated by James J. Myers. In 1903, Bennett returned to the House with the intent of succeeding Myers as Speaker when he retired. That year, Bennett served as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and was a considered a frontrunner to succeed Myers in the next legislative session. However, Bennett decided not to run for reelection and was succeeded by his son, Frank Jr. In 1904, Bennett unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Ernest W. Roberts for the Republican nomination in Massachusetts's 7th congressional district. Personal life and death Bennett married Nancy L. Greeley of Palermo, Maine. They had three children: Frank, Jr., E. Howard, and C. Randolph. Bennett was a Universalist and served as the President of the Massachusetts State Convention of Universalist Churches and the Universalist General Convention of the United States.

Retrieved 16 February 2017, from Sarah Bradshaw, \\"Amid utilities' plan, a dam controversy\\", Poughkeepsie Record-Journal, June 8, 2013 Chalillo Dam's capacity was premeditated to be only 7.0MW. The dam was constructed by Sinohydro of Beijing, China between 2002 and 2005 with the primary purpose of hydroelectric power production. It is owned and operated by Belize Electricity Limited (BEL). The project budget was approximately US 30 million and included at least 350 Belizean construction workers. Its construction generated controversy over its effect on the surrounding rain forest. Two smaller dams, the Mollejon and Vaca, are downstream from the Chalillo Dam.  Location  Chalillo Hydroelectric Dam is situated in the westernmost part of the country where the Macal River converges with the Raspaculo River. It is located in the Maya Mountains and shares adjacency with the Chiquibul National Park and the Pine Ridge Forest Reserve. Positioning Chalillo Hydroelectric Dam approximately 16 kilometers from the Guatemalan border.  Purpose  The primary purpose of Chalillo Hydroelectric Dam is to impound the water in the 46m storage dam during the rainy season and release during shortage.Belize Produces Electricity with Chalillo Dam. (2006). The Island Newspaper. Retrieved 16 February 2017, from At the base of the dam, through a low level valve, water is released during the dry period. Basically, water is carried from the dam downstream to the powerhouse which protects the generating Kaplan turbines. Subsequent to powering the electric turbines, the water drifts back into the Macal River through the tailrace channel and back to its natural route towards its sister facility, Mollejon hydroelectric power plant.  Production  All necessary equipment and controls required for the production of power is contained in the Power House. The circular steel pen stock which is about 80 meters in length and 2.4 meters in diameter facilitates the transport of water from the dam to the power plant. The Kaplan turbine generators equipped with adjustable blades, modern electronic and hydraulic systems help in the production of power. Subsequently, the power is delivered through the 115Kv line which is interconnected to Mollejon switchyard. Power is then distributed to BEL's grid via Mollejon.  Advantages  There are vast environmental issues with the existence of Chalillo hydroelectric dam; this dam contributes a minimal amount of the country's demand for electricity. It does not limit the import of electricity, thus does not decrease energy dependency by supplying minimal power.

Early life and education Emerson Burkhart was born on a farm in Union Township near Kalida, Ohio in 1905. After attending Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, Burkhart moved to Provincetown on Cape Cod, studying with artist Charles Hawthorne. By 1931, Burkhart moved to Columbus to teach at the Ohio School of Art. In 1939, he married Mary-Ann Martin, a famous model who would later become an artist herself. Mary-Ann was a model for several well known artists in New York including Edward Hopper, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Eugene Speicher.Hall, Michael D., and Emerson Burkhart. Emerson Burkhart: an Ohio painters's song of himself. London: Scala Books ; 2009. Print. Career From his house on Woodland Avenue, Burkhart quickly established himself to be a ‚ÄúColumbus Institution.‚Äù Burkhart became known for his portraits and street scenes of Columbus. It is estimated Burkhart painted 3,000 pieces during his 40-year-career, many of these portraits of Ohio residents whom he would pay a small fee. He even painted a portrait of famed writer Carl Sandburg, who was a friend of his. In 1934, Emerson Burkhart received a commission from the WPA Federal Art Project for a mural over the auditorium at Central High School in Columbus. The Federal Art Project intended to give artists like Burkhart employment during the Great Depression and provide art for non-federal government buildings. Burkhart created a 13‚Äô by 70‚Äô mural, known as Music, featuring young women and men dancing and playing musical instruments. Just four years later, in 1938, the principal ordered that the mural be painted over as ‚Äúit was too sexy.‚Äù Starting in 1999, over the course of six years, 1,000 art students from the Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center, under the supervision of art conservators, worked to remove the paint that once covered the mural. After its restoration, the mural was installed at Greater Columbus Convention Center.\\"Columbus Burkhart Murals.\\" McKay Lodge, Inc., Mural restoration, conservation. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 Feb. 2014. In 1938, Burkhart received his second commission from the WPA for ten life size murals at Stillman Hall on the Ohio State University campus and he was paid $1,209 for 13 months of work. Each mural featured important historical figures like Walt Whitman and David Thoreau. Burkhart connected the content of his murals to the function of the building, which served as the social work building. In one mural titled Elizabethan Court Life, Burkhart contrasted the life of the wealthy privileged class with those of the working class. The murals are still located in the building today. After the death of his wife in 1955, Burkhart traveled the world with the International School of America as an Artist-in- Residence. After several years of travel, Burkhart returned to Columbus and continued painting local residents and scenes.

Life Postoli was born to a merchant family in Kor√ß√´ and studied commerce in Istanbul for two years, living with relatives. He later emigrated to the United States, settling in Massachusetts. In his new home Postoli joined the Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America, was secretary for the Vatra branch in Brockton and worked on Dielli (The Sun, published by Vatra). Portions of his novels would be published as supplements to Dielli before their publication in book form. On 4 January 1919, Postoli was a signatory of a memorandum sent to the United States government by the Congress of Vatra. The congress, held at Winthrop Hall in Boston, demanded the demarcation of borders based on the 1913 Treaty of London. In 1921, he returned in his home town in Albania to help establish the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania. Postoli died on 2 October 1927, at age 38. Postoli wrote during the final years of the Albanian National Awakening and Albanian independence. Although he lived in a different era than other rilindas writers, he reflected similar themes: patriotism, opposition to Ottoman rule and pride to the country's history. His 1919 In Defense of the Homeland was typical of his nationalistic, romantic work. Postoli's novels were often inspired by problems he observed. Flower of Remembrance Postoli's novel, Flower of Remembrance, has a political background, and scholar Robert Elsie called it a slight improvement on a predictable plot. The novel, primarily written in 1919, was published in Kor√ß√´ in 1924. In addition to a romantic conflict, it has elements of the late-19th-century Albanian National Awakening. Flower of Remembrance became one of the best-known Albanian novels of the 1920s and 1930s. It later inspired an opera by Kristo Kono, with a libretto by Andon Mara and Aleko Skali. The opera premiered in 1961 and was revived in 1978 and 2012. Plot The novel takes place in a commercial environment blanketed with Greek propaganda. Young Dhimitri, who works at Kristo's shop, loves Kristo's only daughter Olimbia. Olimbia loves him, despite his poverty. To improve his business Kristo hires Niko, a secretary from Greece. Niko insinuates himself with Kristo, engineering a marriage proposal. Although Olimbia protests that she loves Dhimitri, Kristo conspires with Niko to turn Dhimitri in to the Ottoman authorities as a nationalist sympathizer connected to insurgents. Dhimitri, warned by Olimbia, flees from Kor√ß√´ to Monastir (where insurgents are stationed). In the middle of a wild winter night a pack of wolves attacks Dhimitri, killing his horse, and he barely escapes with the help of the insurgents. News reaches Kor√ß√´ that Dhimitri is dead, and Olimbia despairs. Two years later Dhimitri is seen again in Kor√ß√´ as commander of the movement to liberate Albania, foiling Niko's plans to steal Kriso's wealth by marrying Olimbia (with Kristo's blessing) and planning to open his own business.

In 1956 he had his breakthrough as a recording artist with K√∂kspolkan (1956). He showed versatility from the start, learning tap dancing in 16 days after being called in to replace Nils Poppe in the Swedish version of the musical Me and My Girl in the late 1950s. Varg has performed in numerous revues. He has also dubbed a large number of roles; his voice is well known in Sweden from the Swedish versions of Fabeltjeskrant, The Jungle Book, SuperTed, and the Tintin and Asterix animated productions. In Tintin productions he sometimes voices the butler, Nestor, sometimes the detectives Dupont and Dupond (Thomson and Thompson in English versions). In the 1970s, as the owl Helge, he had a lead role alongside Birgitta Andersson in the children's TV series Fr√•n A till √ñ. He has also appeared in cabaret, in the 1990s revival of the comedy TV series Pratmakarna, and for a short time in the 1970s was a member of the Stockholm City Theatre. In the 1970s he starred with Eva Bysing in the TV series Fint som snus (1973) och (1977). He also played the painter Fabian in Gideon Wahlberg's 1978 TV comedy Grabbarna i 57:an. He also played the director Firmin in 100 performances during the long- running production of The Phantom of the Opera at the Oscarsteatern in Stockholm in 1989-1995, where his ability to sing an operatic part without training raised some eyebrows. In the 1990s he became known to a younger generation for 10 years playing the machinist Gustav Sj√∂gren in the TV series Rederiet; G√∂sta Pr√ºzelius, who starred as Reidar Dahl¬Å√©n, was a close friend of his. Personal life In 1960 he married Annette Varg; after her death in 1993, he married Julianna Varg (born 1947). He has three children.

Through his company Team Film he played an important role in the history of Swedish animation. Lasseby was born in G√§llivare and was educated as a teacher of drawing. In 1955, with two classmates, he founded the animation studio AB Team Film, which by 1966 made him one of Sweden's best known animators.CTVD, Cinema, TV Digest 1 p. 11. In 1972 the company produced Agaton Sax och br√∂derna Max, a television series based on the book of the same name by Nils-Olof Franz√©n, one of the series about the detective Agaton Sax. In 1976 they produced a series of three short films for television about Agaton Sax, and also Agaton Sax and the Byk√∂pings Village Festival, the first full-length entirely animated Swedish film, co- produced by the Swedish Film Institute. Team Film went on to produce two further full-length animated features, Peter-No-Tail (1981), which was a critical and popular success and was also released in several other countries, and Peter-No-Tail in Americat (1985), which had faster action and for which some of the animation and coloring was outsourced to Prague; it made less money and received a mixed critical reception. Team Film also produced a series for small children, Totte (1973), based on books by Gunilla Wolde, and three shorts based on other children's books, Kattresan (1982), Sj√∂r√∂varfilmen (1983), and Musikbussen (1994), the first two again sponsored by the Swedish Film Institute.
