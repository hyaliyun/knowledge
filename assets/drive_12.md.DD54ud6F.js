Biography After studying classical piano at the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro, he released a single. As a musician, he has performed in many countries, including for King Hussein of Jordan. In 1983 he returned to Italy, where he has worked as a composer for the RAI TV. He was involved in programs such as \\"tandem\\" and \\"sul Vediamoci 2\\" presented by Rita Dalla Chiesa and Fabrizio Frizzi. At the same time he wrote the song \\"Forza Rimini\\" for the football club of the city. In the spring of 1990 he released his first album \\"Sognatori Erranti\\" on the label NAR. The song Vecchio Poeta was produced and performed with the classic Scarlatti Orchestra of Italy. Lorenzo Piani for seven years, then moved to Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden), where he played with his band at clubs. In 1995, he published the RTI Music CD single The Train, and in 1998 the RTI Music album VIVO feeling. In 2000, Lorenzo Piani began a new adventure as artistic director of Balla Bella Radio Festival Talent Scout project. In 2008, he had an important collaboration with Brian Auger, who played the organ for the album sorpresi Dal Vento. In 2011, he released his fifth album, entitled La Filosofia del CAM. CAM stands for food, love and music. A massive radio promotion brought the song for weeks in the Indie Music Charts. In July 2013 was released the new album of the singer/songwriter Lorenzo Piani, titled10 ten. 10 is what Lorenzo Piani defines as the perfect number to which he dedicates the track that closes the entire project. Lorenzo Piani was an artist outside the box of the music business and in his career he has always preferred to success, the freedom to make his music. He was a singer- songwriter who is highly respected abroad, performed live regularly, and just from this, his openness to new experiences he developed the idea of the project 10. The travel with the music led him to meet and discuss with other artists from Europe and thus was born the idea of 10, a collaboration with female artists from different European countries, that they duet with him on three tracks in different idioms. The meaning of 10 is the vision of life by Piani, and secondly an analysis of the most intimate feelings of men and women. It's a proposal that shows a way to overcome this critical moment of social and economic life, where the human being finds unsuspected resources in its creativity, in being able to read things and events with a \\"positive winning\\" mindset. There are also some jazzy moments dedicated to his passion for the music. For the English speaking market, Nirah, a young performer, duets with Lorenzo in the song THE SOUL, a song that is catchy-sounding and ethno-electronic. For the Spanish, Portuguese and Latin markets, Mar√≠a Villal√≥n, an artist of great talent, duets with Lorenzo Piani in the song ‚ÄúMudar‚Äù. The message of MUDAR that Lorenzo wants to transmit, is a sign of hope in order to change all the negativity that pollutes the existence of human beings, life is to be lived to the fullest. For Austrian and German Markets, Stephanie, a child prodigy of the German melodic song, duets with Lorenzo Piani in GRANDE AMORE. Stephanie wanted to sing the song GRANDE AMORE with Lorenzo Piani, in Italian; for an Austrian singer, an important artistic endeavor. On 27 March 2015 the instrumental album SHADES OF MUSIC was released, a selection of instrumental tracks, which defines the various nuances of the music. On 20 November 2015 the single \\"SENZA UN SORRISO\\" was released. This release is a track from a new art project, conceived by Lorenzo Piani, POP CLASSIC. It is a crossover project, a musical contamination that originates from an array of pop and classical counterpoint develops. His partner in this project is a star of the opera world, the Sicilian soprano Desir√©e Rancatore. The soprano Desir√©e Rancatore's voice is interwoven with the dough soft and persuasive voice of Lorenzo Piani, and the theme comes to life through harmonies typical of classical music. The texts are structured with a book specially written, as well as in the tradition of Italian opera. On 14 August 2016 his official site announced his death.

In 1866, a warrant was issued for Levy's arrest for forging a bill of exchange, but he went abroad and the police were unable to find him until 1870 when he was discovered living in Liverpool under the assumed name of Edward Lingden. He was tried for deception and forgery at the Old Bailey in July 1870, but acquitted on the ground that the jury believed he had sufficient authority to use the name of the drawer of the bill.Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 11 July 1870, pages 234-236; http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=def1-582-18700711√∑=t18700711-582#highlight (accessed 22 April 2013).The Times, 7 July 1870 page 11.

Levy then found himself a position as clerk to a solicitor called Fisher, who left him almost entirely in charge of running his practice. In April and May 1879, Levy was again tried twice for deception and forgery at the Old Bailey. In the first trial, he was accused of endorsing a cheque for ¬£121, recovered from a debtor on behalf of a client, into his own personal account. Levy was acquitted when he produced a document which appeared to authorize him to sign the name of the client. In the second trial he was accused of a similar act of forgery relating to a cheque for ¬£29 for different client. This time he was found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months' hard labour.Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 29 April 1879, pages 68-93; http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=def1-495-18790428√∑=t18790428-495#highlight (accessed 22 April 2013).Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 29 May 1879, pages 193-203; http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=def1-562-18790526√∑=t18790526-562#highlight (accessed 22 April 2013).The Times, 30 May 1879, page 11.The Times 31 May 1879, page 13. After his release, Levy was again charged at the Old Bailey in December 1882, along with his sons Daniel and Henry, for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Levy had found another complicit solicitor, Micklethwaite, who again allowed him to carry out his own business in the firm's name. In essence they had been acting as injury lawyers representing individuals claiming compensation from railway and tram companies for accident injuries. They supplied supporting false witnesses who had been paid and tutored to commit perjury. Two other collaborators called Kingswell and Brown helped concoct the stories and sought out suitable accident cases. The Levys and their collaborators were found guilty. Edward Lawrence Levy and Kingswell each received five years' penal servitude, Brown two years' hard labour, and Daniel and Henry Levy each eighteen months' hard labour.Proceedings of the Old Bailey 5‚Äì8 December 1882; p116-144; http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?div=t18821120-70 (accessed 22 April 2013).The Times 6 December 1882, page 12.The Times, 7 December 1882; page 10.The Times, 8 December 1882, page 5. The Times considered the Levys' \\"organized system of fraud and perjury\\" at length in an editorial/leader article of 22 December 1882, implying they must have been involved in many other similar cases that had not come to light, and suggesting that the sentences handed to Levy and his sons were unduly lenient. Levy was tried yet again at the Old Bailey in May 1892, under the name of Edward Lewis, and received a third prison sentence for receiving stolen goods. He had set up a business lending small sums of money, and had induced a young debtor named Brett to steal furnishing materials from his employer in order to meet his repayments. It was said the furnishings were for Levy's own use because his household effects were badly in need of refurbishment. Levy was sentenced to a further five years' penal servitude.Proceedings of the Old Bailey 25 May 1892, pages 869-879; http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=def2-567-18920523√∑=t18920523-567#highlight (accessed 22 April 2013).The Times 27 May 1892, page 12. At the end of his life, he had sunk to lending small sums of just a few pounds, preying on the young and naive, and receiving stolen goods of low value which he needed because of his own reduced circumstances. He died in Wormwood Scrubs just five months later, on 20 October 1892, leaving ¬£275.England and Wales Probate Calendar: index of wills and administrations.

He was influential in the Indian independence movement and a veteran member of the civil society of Bangladesh. He is mostly known for his participation in the Chittagong Armoury Raid, an armed resistance movement led by Surya Sen to uproot the British colonial rule from the British India in 1930. Born in 1911, in Chittagong, Binod Bihari was the last surviving revolutionary from the Chittagong armoury raid and was active in many significant events in the history of Bangladesh. In 2000, he received the Independence Day Award, the highest civilian award in Bangladesh.  Early life and education  Binod Bihari Chowdhury was born in the village of Uttarvurshi under the Boalkhali Upazila in Chittagong district which was then a part of the East Bengal and Assam province of British India. He was the fifth child of his parents, Kamini Kumar Chowdhury and Roma Rani Chowdhury. His father, Kamini Kumar Chowdhury was a lawyer in Chittagong. Binod Bihari started his primary education from the Rangamatia Board School in Fatikchhari Upazila.He was the student of Fatikchari's most famous & old school name Fatickchari Coronation Model High School. He was granted a scholarship for his outstanding performance in the matriculation examinations in 1929 from Saroatoli High School. He received the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts and Bachelor of Law in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively while serving as a prisoner at the Duly Detention Camp. He was married to Biva Das.  Chittagong armoury raid  In 1927, Binod Bihari joined the anti- British revolutionary group Jugantar through a friend in school. Soon he came into contact with Surya Sen and within few days became one of his intimate associates. At that time Surya Sen was planning an armed uprising against the British Raj in Chittagong. The plan was to capture the two main armouries in Chittagong and then destroying the telegraph and telephone office, followed by assassination of members of the \\"European Club\\", the majority of whom were government or military officials involved in maintaining the British Raj in India. Firearms retailers were also to be raided, while rail and communication lines were to be cut to sever Chittagong from rest of British India. The plan was accompanied by Binod Bihari and some others. The intrigue was finally executed at 10 p.m. on 18 April 1930. Chittagong was liberated from British India for four days. However, the British Raj then mobilised a large body of troops in and around Chittagong. Binod Bihari along with some co- revolutionaries was taking shelter at the Jalalabad hills. On 22 April, they came under an austere attack from the British troops. Twelve revolutionaries and over eighty troops were killed in the battle. Binod Bihari was wounded at his neck in that battle. The revolutionaries came under a trial between January and March 1932. Binod Bihari was deported to the Duly Detention Camp in Rajputana.  Political career  Binod Bihari was appointed as an Assistant General Secretary of the Chittagong district committee of Indian National Congress in 1939. He was also a member of the executive committee of Bengal Provincial Congress from 1940 to 1946. Binod Bihari was elected as the General Secretary of the Chittagong Branch of Indian National Congress in 1946. After the partition of India in 1947, Chittagong became a part of East Pakistan. Many of his co-revolutionaries moved to India but Binod Bihari chose to stay in his hometown. In 1947, he was elected as a member of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. He retired from all kinds of political activity following the imposition of martial law by Ayub Khan.  After independence of Bangladesh  Binod Bihari never joined politics again, but he was quite active in the democratic, cultural and social movements in Bangladesh. In 2010, a three-day birth centenary program was held in Chittagong in the occasion of the hundredth birth anniversary of Binod Bihari from 8 to 10 April. The program was attended by several members of the civil society of Bangladesh including the Nobel laureate Prof. Muhammad Yunus. A memoir of Binod Bihari was also published titled Ognijhora Dingulo.  Death  Binod Bihari was suffering from old age complications. His health began to deteriorate in the early April 2013. He was taken to Fortis Hospital in Kolkata where he died on 10 April the same year. His death occurred only a week before the 83rd anniversary of the Raid, and he was its last survivor. His body wasbrought back to Bangladesh a day later. Binod Bihari was paid tribute by people from all walks of life including the President and Prime Minister of Bangladesh. He was given state honour by the Government of Bangladesh. Binod Bihari's last rituals were performed at the Abhoy Mitra cremation center in Chittagong.

BGA journalistic investigations are guided by the newly adopted BGA guidelines for investigations and oversight protocols. They work under the motto, \\"Shining a Light on Government\\".Better Government Organization The Association works under a board of directors and does not accept government funding. It functions off of the support of foundations, corporations, law firms, major donors, and individuals. Mission and History The Better Government Association's mission is to work for \\"integrity, transparency, and accountability in government by exposing corruption and inefficiency; identifying and advocating effective public policy; and engaging and mobilizing the electorate to achieve authentic and responsible reform\\". In May 1923, E. J. Davis, director of the Anti-Saloon League, along with a group of clergymen, lawyers, editors, and businessmen formed the Better Government Association to combat the corruption in the Prohibition-era government. They believed that \\"public officials under close scrutiny would serve the public better; that the best voter was an informed one and the best citizen was an involved one\\". After a merger with the Legislative Voter's League, the BGA worked for the next 34 years. In 1957, new Executive Director George Mahin set out to evolve the role of the BGA. In the 1960s, Mahin and Charles Percy, a board member, started a new program called Operation Watchdog, which allowed the BGA to become a media partner. This partnership put pressure on state politicians and public officials. The first major investigation was conducted by Chicago Tribune reporter George Bliss, who uncovered corruption at the Metropolitan Sanitary District. After Richard Friedman's brief tenure as executive director (1969‚Äì71), J. Terrence Brunner joined the BGA. By this time, the organization had earned a national reputation for its investigations. In 1977, the BGA worked with CBS' 60 Minutes and Chicago Sun-Times to produce the Mirage Tavern Investigation, in which many bribe-seeking inspectors and employees were exposed. Brunner was also known for starting the investigative internship program. In 1979, the BGA opened new offices in Washington, D.C., and Springfield, Illinois; the D.C. office, however, was too expensive and was closed in 1984. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the BGA exposed fraud in the Chicago Public Schools, lax security at the O'Hare International Airport, and corrupt secretary of state George Ryan, among other investigations. After nearly 30 years as executive director, Brunner retired, and former BGA General Counsel Terrance Norton took his place. Under his reign, the BGA compiled the Alper Integrity Index, the nation's first comprehensive analysis and ranking of government transparency and accountability laws across 50 states. The study ranks states in laws about open records, whistleblower protection, campaign finance, open meetings, and conflicts of interest. The Index was published in the fall of 2002. In 2003, Sue Walker replaced Norton, and in 2004, former staff attorney Jay Stewart took her place. In June 2009, Andy Shaw became the new executive director. Shaw was an education reporter and then the editorial director at NBC 5, where he won two local Emmys, prior to joining ABC 7, where he covers city, county, suburban, state, and national politics and government.Andy Shaw  ABC Biography At this point, the BGA was in need of revitalization. There are now five working units that make up the organization: Investigations, Advocacy, Communications, Watchdog Training, and Reporting and Administration. In the fall of 2010, BGA launched a new website, and it continues to investigate misdeeds. Shaw also introduced a new idea to the non-profit, to propose new policies instead of just exposing problems. Organization structure The Better Government Association is broken up into five units of operation. The Investigative Unit The Investigative Unit looks into allegations of waste, fraud, and corruption in city, county, suburban and state government, and the results are made public through partnerships with local media. The BGA works with the New York Times through the Chicago News Cooperative, Chicago Sun-Times, Crain's Chicago Business, and the Chicago television affiliates of ABC, CBS, and FOX. The BGA has a regularly updated blog managed by the investigative unit called the Notebook. In September, 2010, the BGA announced new members to the investigative team. Bob Reed, Bob Herguth, and John Conroy are award-winning, veteran journalists added to the team, bringing more than 90 combined years of journalistic experience. These additions doubled the size of the investigative unit. The Policy Advocacy Unit The Policy Advocacy Unit proposes policy solution to corruption, inefficiency, lack of accountability, and waste in government based on the results of BGA investigations. In 2010, the BGA Policy Unit focused on issues such as streamlining government, TIFs and judicial reform. The Citizen Watchdog Training Unit The Citizen Watchdog Training Unit teaches citizens to monitor and report on their local governments, working with BGA investigators and editors. Trainings take place throughout the state, particularly in underserved communities. Watchdog Training teaches you how to keep an eye on government and report on what's happening in your community. It helps to learn the ins and outs of the Open Meetings Act and the Freedom of Information Act. The Citizen Education and Communication Unit The Citizen Education and Communication Unit promotes civic engagement by keeping the public informed with reliable facts, in-depth information and thoughtful perspectives. Through traditional and social media, the BGA educated hundreds of thousands of citizens to educate them on developments in local and state government, train citizens on techniques for monitoring government activities, provide information for whistleblowers, announce calls-to-action and generate debate. Richard H. Driehaus Foundation Awards for Investigative Reporting The Awards for Investigative Reporting are presented each year and highlight the importance of investigative journalism in advancing the principles of democracy. Investigations The Better Government Association has constant ongoing investigations. Some of the most notable investigations are the BGA's first major investigation, the Mirage Tavern Investigation, and the Rescuing Illinois Project. BGA's First Investigation In 1962, Chicago Tribune reporter George Bliss worked with BGA investigators to uncover corruption at the Metropolitan Sanitary District. Bliss detailed waste, fraud, padded payrolls, kickbacks, public land giveaways to special interests, rigged contracts, and the link between organized crime and the commissioners of the sanitary district. In 1962 he won the first of his three Pulitzer Prizes for this series. The Mirage Tavern Investigation Pam Zekman, a reporter at the Chicago Tribune, and BGA's director of investigations Bill Recktenwald worked together to open a \\"fake\\" tavern called the Mirage Tavern to attempt to uncover bribery in investigators and inspectors. The two posed as a married couple starting a new business and enlisted the help of many different investigators and inspectors to see what fraud they would uncover.The Mirage: A Fake Tavern  WBEZ They bought a tavern with many building-code violations, so it could document how many city inspectors and fire marshals could be bought off with just $10 bills. The Mirage only stayed open for about two months. They were concerned that people were beginning to figure out the true reason of why they were there and could not stay in business any longer. The first installment of the Mirage Tavern series was published in the Chicago Sun-Times in 1978. Inspectors were suspended, fired, and chastised. The state department of revenue set up a special bureau to investigate cash businesses‚Äîand called it the Mirage Audit Unit. Readers also responded with their own stories of fraud and city officials promised improved integrity. The investigation was denied a Pulitzer Prize by jurors who believed the Sun-Times had engaged in unethical deception to get the story. Rescuing Illinois Project The Better Government Association conducts ongoing in-depth reports about improving and reforming state government. The Rescuing Illinois Project will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the inner workings of state government to identify irregularities and efficiency problems and to propose responsible solutions and reforms. In 2012, as part of the Rescuing Illinois Project, the BGA revealed fraud in the state's school system. The Chicago Public School system subsequently implemented a new sick-day policy that it hoped would save tens of millions of dollars a year under a new sick-day policy that will end excessive sick-day payouts. The previous policy allowed departing employees to keep up to 325 unused sick days in cash. The district estimated it spent about $37 million a year on unused sick days for both non- union and union employees.CPS Cracking Down on Big Payouts for Sick Days Awards and notable achievements The BGA and the Center on Wrongful Convictions won the Edward R. Murrow Award for the June 2011 investigation into the high cost of wrongful convictions. This was a groundbreaking series documenting the human and financial toll of alleged government and police misconduct that led to 85 people being wrongfully incarcerated for violent crimes they did not commit.2011 Edward R.

It is located in the Conwy Valley, on the eastern bank of the River Conwy, north east of Llanrwst, south west of Abergele and south of Conwy. The community includes the village of Llanddoged and the rural settlements around Maenan. At the 2001 census it had a population of 574, increasing to 602 at the 2011 census. In 1283 Edward I of England forced the monks of Aberconwy Abbey, in Conwy, to relocate to Maenan, to make way for the castle and fortifications he was building in the town. The abbey survived until it was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1538. A house was built on the site, which was replaced in 1852 by what is now the Maenan Abbey Hotel. Drainage work at the hotel in 2011 unearthed remains of the abbey buildings. Nearby Maenan Hall is a 15th-century timber-framed house containing elaborate Elizabethan plasterwork, which is Grade I listed. The house was bought in 1946, and restored, by Henry McLaren, who was responsible for developing Bodnant Garden, as a dower house for his wife Christabel. The garden, which is open to the public a few days each year, was developed by McLaren and, after his death in 1953, his widow and their youngest son, Christopher McLaren. To the east stands Caer Oleu, a prehistoric hillfort. Saint Doged's Church, set in a circular churchyard in Llanddoged, was rebuilt in 1839, but was originally a sixth-century martyrium constructed to shelter the grave of Saint Doged. It is Grade II* listed. Nearby, the waters of Saint Doged's Well were reputed to cure eye-disorders. Mary Vaughan Jones was born in Maenan in 1918. An infants teacher, she is best known for more than 40 Welsh children's books she wrote. She is remembered by an award presented every three years by the Welsh Books Council to recognise outstanding contributions to children's books in Wales.

He was the father of British champion jockey, Richard Hughes, and won at the Cheltenham Festival as both jockey and trainer. Career As a jockey Hughes' most famous successes in the saddle came at the Cheltenham Festival. In 1977, he partnered the Mick O'Toole-trained Davy Lad to success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Two years later, he was victorious in one of the most famous clashes in jumps racing history when Monksfield rode to a famous victory over Sea Pigeon in the Champion Hurdle. As a trainer Hughes had always planned to train and having prepared for three years, he took out his training licence in 1980. Light The Wad was an early success for the fledgling yard, winning the Irish Arkle at Leopardstown in 1982 and successive renewals of the Drogheda Chase at the Punchestown Festival in 1981 and 1982. That same year, 1982, he sent out Miller Hill to win the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. Other notable wins in the 1980s included Chow Mein in the 1985 Galway Plate, William Crump in the 1986 Huzzar Handicap Hurdle and Ballychorus Dream in the 1988 Drinmore Novice Chase. For a long time around the turn of the decade, a persistent bug plagued the yard and success was hard to come by. Major success returned with Guest Performance who won six hurdle races between February 1996 and January 1997, before winning the Grade 3 Nas Na Riogh Novice Chase at Naas in 1998. Hughes won the race again with Colonel Braxton in 2002, a horse which had also won the Grade 1 Menolly Homes Champion Novice Hurdle. Hughes' most famous recruit, Hardy Eustace, was picked up for a mere IR¬£21,000 in 2001, yet went on to win at the very highest level. In his novice hurdle season, he won the Grade 1 Royal Bond Novice Hurdle and the Sun Alliance Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. The horse went on to win the 2004 and 2005 Champion Hurdles and the Punchestown equivalent in 2004. Success also came in the Irish Champion Hurdle in 2007. By the time he retired at the end of the 2009/10 season, he had earned well over ‚Ç¨1,000,000 in prize money. Bought at the same sale as Hardy Eustace for a similar sum, Central House was almost as successful, winning five Grade 2 contests, one Grade 1 and being placed in seven other Graded chases, accumulating just over ‚Ç¨515,000 in prize money during his career. Other Graded race winners have included Schindlers Hunt, Grangeclare Lark and Grand National performers Rare Bob, Black Apalachi and Vic Venturi. Former apprentice of Hughes', Pat Dobbs spoke highly of his time with the yard. ‚ÄúDessie did more work around the yard than most of us lads. He was first out every morning and used to muck out just across from me, telling me to hurry up when I was too slow. He was a great horseman and paid attention to every detail.‚Äù Principal jockeys * Bryan Cooper * Roger Loughran * Ian McCarthy * Mark Enright * Pat Dobbs Major wins As a jockey Great Britain * Aintree Hurdle - (3) - Monksfield (1977 (dead heat), 1978, 1979) * Arkle Chase - Tip the Wink (1977)Chinrullah (1979) * Champion Chase - Chinrullah (1980) (subsequently disqualified) * Champion Hurdle - Monksfield (1979) * Cheltenham Gold Cup ‚Äì Davy Lad (1977) * Sun Alliance Hurdle - (2) - Davy Lad (1975), Parkhill (1976) * Supreme Novices' Hurdle - Mac's Chariot (1977) * Stayers' Hurdle - Bit Of A Jig (1976) As a trainer Great Britain * Champion Hurdle - (2) - Hardy Eustace (2004, 2005) * Sun Alliance Hurdle - Hardy Eustace (2003) * Supreme Novices' Hurdle - Miller Hill (1982) * Triumph Hurdle - Our Conor (2013) \\\\---- Ireland * Arkle Novice Chase - (2) Light The Wad (1981) Schindler's Hunt (2007) * Irish Champion Hurdle - Hardy Eustace (2007) * Racing Post Novice Chase - (2) - Central House (2002), Schindler's Hunt (2006) * Irish Grand National - Timbera (2003) * Spring Juvenile Hurdle -(3) - Mutineer (2003), Our Conor (2013), Guitar Pete (2014) * Growise Champion Novice Chase - Rare Bob (2009) * Punchestown Champion Hurdle - Hardy Eustace (2004) * Morgiana Hurdle - Hardy Eustace (2008) * Royal Bond Novice Hurdle -Hardy Eustace (2002) References Category:Racehorse trainers Category:Irish horse trainers Category:Irish jockeys Category:2014 deaths Category:1943 births ","title":"Dessie Hughes"},{"id":"39092219","text":"Takandan Giwa is a small village in Toro Local Government Area, Bauchi State, Nigeria.

On 14 August 2013, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $15 million contract to develop the airframe of their UCLASS entry. Contracts of the same amount were awarded to Boeing, General Atomics, and Northrop Grumman for their competing designs.US Navy Moves Ahead To Develop Unmanned Carrier Aircraft - Defensenews.com, 14 August 2013 In August 2018, Boeing was selected over Lockheed Martin and the other entrants.Boeing‚Äôs MQ-25 Win Hints at Future USAF Tanker. Air Force Magazine. 31 August 2018. Design The Sea Ghost incorporated technologies from the F-35C Lightning II and RQ-170 Sentinel UAV, both other Lockheed designs. It had a bat-wing fuselage and emissions and bandwidth management for multi- spectral stealth. Lockheed claimed it could reduce manpower requirements because a single operator could be able to operate multiple aircraft.Lockheed unveils unmanned surveillance and strike aircraft - Flightglobal.com, April 9, 2013 Lockheed had a full-scale mock-up of the design to look at fit checks when the pre-solicitation was issued. The flying wing design was chosen because it was well suited for the missions intended for the aircraft, and the company had experience with it; it is aerodynamically efficient, allows for very low signatures, is structurally simplistic, and is easy to manufacture. The Sea Ghost would use sea spray optimized stealth materials developed for the F-35. It would have range and endurance, but not the weapons payload capability of a long-range strike platform, such as the A-6 Intruder; making it carry large payloads at long ranges would affect affordability. It was planned with open architecture avionics to have the ability to put new sensors or mission systems onboard over time, and was made to operate autonomously with the operator intervening if necessary.\\"Lockheed unveils more information on UCLASS programme.\\" Flight International, Dave Majumdar, 12 April 2013. The Sea Ghost competed against the Northrop Grumman X-47B, the General Atomics Sea Avenger, and the Boeing Phantom Ray, or operational versions of those aircraft, in the program.One of These ‚ÄòBots Will Be the Navy‚Äôs Next Killer Drone - Wired.com, March 27, 2013 Lockheed Martin stressed the flying wing design of the Sea Ghost had the \\"inherent\\" stealth needed for the Navy to operate in future high-threat environments. They believed they had an advantage in that it was designed from the outset to be stealthy, and that the Navy had to ‚Äústart out with the right shape of the aircraft‚Äù because capability improvements may not be viable if they don't. A Request for Proposals (RFP) released by the Navy for the UCLASS in early April 2014 called for a strike and reconnaissance platform that would gain additional capabilities over time, including the ability to be refueled aerially, and to act as a tanker itself.Lockheed stresses importance of ‚Äòflying wing‚Äô UCLASS design - Flightglobal.com, 30 April 2014 In early 2016, the UCLASS was changed into the Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), changing the focus from high-end strike to a more basic air vehicle functioning primarily as an aerial tanker. Although pursuing a more basic design could favor General Atomics and Boeing wing-body-tail submissions, Lockheed believed a flying wing could be affordable while allowing more room for growth. By selecting a basic flying wing design, weapons, sensors, and stealth could be more easily added to the existing airframe to allow it to penetrate into a contested environment.Skunk Works Head: Navy Should Consider A Flying Wing Design for MQ-XX Stingray - News.USNI.org, 15 March 2016 See also References Category:Stealth aircraft Category:DARPA Category:Tailless aircraft Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of the United States Category:Single-engined jet aircraft Category:Flying wings ","title":"Lockheed Martin Sea Ghost"},{"id":"39092316","text":"A bijinga painting of a courtesan, by Kaigetsud≈ç Ando, c. 1700 - 1720 is a Japanese term which literally means \\"a beautiful person\\" and is synonymous with .

Bijin woodblock print by Kikukawa Eizan, 19th century, Brooklyn Museum Meaning In practice the term bijin means \\"beautiful woman\\" because the first kanji character, bi (Áæé), has a feminine connotation. Translation of kanji character Áæé The character expressed the concept of beauty by first using the element for \\"sheep\\", which must have been viewed as beautiful, and was combined with the element for \\"big\\", ultimately forming a new kanji. Bijin can also be translated as \\"a beauty\\"; in a modern and informal context it means \\"a doll\\". Its modern meaning was also said to have undergone an internationalization with the term for the Moon and the a lord or ruler on high.

The chapel was restored and widened in the 18th century, and there was restoration work in 1811, 1879 and 1893. In the 1980s the church became part of a benefice which had the churches of West Markham and Weston. In February 2013 another two churches became part of the benefice, Marnham and Normanton on Trent. The White Chapel The Tomb of Sir John and Lady White in the White Chapel of the Church of St. Nicholas, Tuxford To the north of the Chancel is the mortuary chapel of the Whites of Tuxford and Wallingwells. The fine alabaster tomb to Sir John White, Knt. (1558-1625) and his wife Agnes Cecil (sister of Queen Elizabeth I's Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley) is situated within the chapel. Within the chapel is also a memorial tablet to Captain Charles Lawrence White (the youngest brother of Sir Thomas White, 1st Baronet), who died in the Siege of Bayonne in 1814. The tablet depicts the martyrdom of St. Lawrence on the gridiron. Below the chapel is the burial vault wherein rest members of the White family, including Sir Thomas White, 1st Baronet and his heir, Sir Thomas White, 2nd Baronet. A second, earlier, burial vault is to be found below the Chancel. This vault contains the remains of members of the Stanhope family of Rampton, as well as earlier generations of the Whites. On the walls of the chapel can be found two stunningly painted funerary hatchments. The first depicts the conjugal arms of Sir Thomas White, 1st Bt. whilst the second hatchment shows the full achievement of arms of Sir Thomas White, 2nd Bt. The last head of the White family to live primarily at Tuxford Manor, Thomas White, is buried beneath the High Altar of the church.

March to Izucar de Matamoros and surprise attack A night march in the rain from Puebla brought General Lane's force to the outskirts of Izucar de Matamoros, early in the morning. Lane quickly launched an attack, surprising and routing the guards at an outpost there. The surprised guards fled into the town with the Texan riflemen and Louisiana Dragoons in hot pursuit. Bursting into the town, a \\"short and sanguinary action\\" made the main body of troops flee and disperse into a forest on the far side of town leaving Gen.

At the depot they captured 3 artillery pieces, twelve boxes of ammunition, five hundred muskets, five hundred sabres which they had transport to take away. They spent the rest of the day resting and destroying the remaining twelve tons of shot, large amounts of bullets, matches, medical stores, and other public property from the depot.

Organ The church contains an organ dating from 1860 by Bevington and Sons.  Bell  The church has one bell which is \\"swing chimed\\", it is hung on half a wheel. Burials The church is the burial place of Henry Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle. After his wife died in 1822, the 4th Duke built a church and mausoleum at Milton, Nottinghamshire. In 1833, when the new church at Milton was finished, it became the parish church, replacing the old one at West Markham. This situation was reversed, however, in 1949 when All Saints was reinstated as the parish church, and the Duke‚Äôs mausoleum was left to decay. Milton Church, now simply a mausoleum, was finally rescued in 1972 when the Churches Conservation Trust took it into guardianship.Newcastle Mausoleum  Group of Churches  West Markham church is part of the Tuxford Benefice. *St Nicholas, Tuxford *All Saints', West Markham *All Saints', Weston *St Matthew, Normanton on Trent;and *St Wilfrid, Marnham  Clergy  The present Priest in Charge for the Benefice is Rev Wall, the Curate is Rev Dunk.

Owen (June 22, 1922 ‚Äì February 15, 2011) was the twelfth president of the University of North Georgia (UNG) and a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy during the Second World War. He was the president of UNG for twenty-two years, longer than any other president in the University's history. Early life John H. Owen was born in Savannah, Georgia on June 22, 1922, though he lived in Quincy, Florida from his early childhood to his early 20s. Following high school, he attended the University of Florida and earned a B.S. in three years with honours. He then attended Northwestern University in Chicago until becoming enlisted in the Navy in 1943. The three years of his Naval service during World War II were spent in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Pacific, Philippines, China Sea, Korea, Japan, and Okinawa Island. Following his service in the War, Owen resumed his Education at the University of Wisconsin. There he majored in plant pathology and biochemistry. In only five semesters he earned two Master's and one Doctorate degree. Upon completion of his education, Owen became a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve Research Units in Gainesville, Fl, a position that he held from 1949 to 1969. He reached the rank of lieutenant commander in 1964. Service in education The first professional position held by Owen in the field of education was as a professor in the Department of Plant Pathology at his alma mater, the University of Florida. During the ten years he spent there, Owen published upwards of thirty articles in national scientific journals. In 1958, his final year at UF, he was voted professor of the year. In 1959 Owen became professor of plant pathology and plant genetics at the University of Georgia. He is commonly credited as the primary actor in UGA's acquisition of its multimillion-dollar plant-science building. While at the university, Owen invested a good amount of his time and energy working with the United States Forest Service. It was through his work with the USFS that he was able to establish the forest pathology division in his department. Much research efforts were also devoted to the study of disease in subtropical plants. The attention and renown he received in this specific area of study brought him many invitations, most from the Organization of American States, to give lectures in Cuba, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, In 1968 Owen was promoted to director of all agricultural experiment stations in the state of Georgia. North Georgia College Owens Hall student dormitory at the University of North Georgia In 1970, Owen succeeded Merritt Eldred Hoag as president North Georgia College (now known as the University of North Georgia). His predecessors, Hoag and Rogers, had devoted much of their presidency to building projects. It was because of their work that Owen was able to divert his energy elsewhere, away from new construction projects. Instead, Owen focused on increasing student enrollment, which would in turn increase the school's budget and faculty salary. He was assisted in this endeavor by many of the friends he had in the Georgia General Assembly as well as his longtime friend Governor/President Jimmy Carter.

In material science, great interest is shown in related single layered materials, such as graphene, composed of carbon, and silicene, composed of silicon. Such materials represent a new generation of semiconductors with potential applications in computer chips and solar cells. Germanane‚Äôs structure is similar to graphane, and therefore graphene. Bulk germanium does not adopt this structure. Germanane has been produced in a two-step route starting with calcium germanide. From this material, the calcium is removed by de-intercalation with HCl to give a layered solid with the empirical formula GeH. The Ca sites in Zintyl-phase CaGe2 interchange with the H atoms in the HCl solution, which leaves us with GeH and CaCl2.  Properties  Germanane's electron mobility is predicted to be more than ten times that of silicon and five times more than conventional germanium. Hydrogen-doped germanane is chemically and physically stable when exposed to air and water. Germanane has a ‚Äúdirect band gap,‚Äù easily absorbing and emitting light, and potentially useful for optoelectronics. (Conventional silicon and germanium have indirect band gaps, reducing light absorption or emission.) In addition, the Ge atoms have higher spin-orbit coupling (as compared to C in graphene/graphane) which can allow us to explore the quantum spin Hall effect.  Electrical and Optical Properties  Researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the University of Ioannina in Greece, have reported on the first field effect transistor fabricated with germanane, highlighting its promising electronic and optoelectronic properties.http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/67839 Germanane FET's show transport in both electron and hole doped regimes with on/off current ratio of up to 105(104) and carrier mobilities of 150 cm2 (V.s)‚àí1(70 cm2 (V.s)‚àí1) at 77 K (room temperature).

The siege was the culmination of a lengthy campaign on the Ottoman side, which involved co-ordinated but independent manoeuvres by a large army and navy. The Trapezuntine defenders had relied on a network of alliances that would provide them with support and manpower when the Ottomans began their siege, but failed at the moment Emperor David Megas Komnenos most needed it. The Ottoman land campaign, which was the more challenging part, involved intimidating the ruler of Sinope into surrendering his realm, a march lasting more than a month through uninhabited mountainous wilderness, several minor battles with different opponents, and ended with the siege of Trebizond. The combined Ottoman forces blockaded the fortified city by land and sea until Emperor David agreed to surrender his capital city on terms: in return for his tiny realm, he would be given properties elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, where David, his family, and his courtiers would live. For the rest of the inhabitants of Trebizond, however, their fates were less favorable. The Sultan divided them into three groups: one group were forced to leave Trebizond and resettle in Constantinople; the next group became slaves either of the Sultan or of his dignitaries; and the last group were left to live in the countryside surrounding Trebizond, but not within its walls. Some 800 male children became recruits for his Janissaries, the elite Ottoman military unit, which required them to convert to Islam.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204‚Äì1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 106 With the last members of the Palaiologan dynasty having fled the Despotate of the Morea the previous year for Italy, Trebizond had become the last outpost of Byzantine civilization; with its fall, that civilization came to an end.As pointed out by Donald M. Nicol, The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261‚Äì1453, second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 401 \\"It was the end of the free Greek world,\\" wrote Steven Runciman, who then noted that those Greeks still not under Ottoman rule still lived \\"under lords of an alien race and an alien form of Christianity. Only among the wild villages of Mani, in the southeastern Peloponnese, into whose rugged mountains no Turk ventured to penetrate, was there left any semblance of liberty.\\"Runciman, The Fall of Constantinople: 1453 (Cambridge: University Press, 1969), p. 176  Background  The original sources differ on their explanation of Mehmed's actual motivations for attacking Trebizond. William Miller quotes Kritoboulos as stating that Emperor David of Trebizond's \\"reluctance to pay tribute and the intermarriages with Hassan and the Georgian court provoked the Sultan to invade the Empire.\\"Miller, Trebizond, p. 100 On the other hand, Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k cites a passage from the 15th-century Ottoman historian Kemal Pasha-zade, who wrote:Inalcik, \\"Mehmed the Conqueror (1432‚Äì1481) and His Time\\", Speculum, 35 (1960), p. 422 By the 1450s, the Ottoman Empire either occupied or had established hegemony over much of the territories the Byzantine Empire held before the Fourth Crusade sacked Constantinople in 1204. Many of Mehmed's campaigns in that period can be explained by assuming he was taking possession of the bits and fragments that he still did not rule directly: Enos fell after a lightning march in the winter of 1456;Miller, \\"The Gattilusj of Lesbos (1355‚Äì1462)\\", Byzantinische Zeitschrift, 22 (1913), pp. 431f after showing unusual patience with the surviving Palaiologoi ruling the Morea, who spent more time fighting each other than paying their tribute, Mehmed at last conquered all but one Byzantine fortress in that peninsula when Mistra fell on 29 May 1460;Nicol, Last Centuries, pp. 396‚Äì398 Amasria was taken from the Genoese around the same time;Franz Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time, edited by William C. Hickman and translated by Ralph Manheim (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 180f except for several islands in the Aegean Sea under the rule of various Latin lords, Trebizond was the one remaining piece of the former Eastern Roman Empire not under Mehmed's direct rule. Emperor John IV of Trebizond was aware of the threat Mehmed II posed for him at least as early as February 1451, when the Byzantine diplomat George Sphrantzes arrived in Trebizond seeking a bride for his emperor, Constantine XI. John had happily related to the visiting diplomat the news of the death of Sultan Murad II, and that Mehmed II's youth meant that now his empire could last longer and be blessed. Sphrantzes, however, was taken aback and explained to him that Mehmed's youth and seeming friendship were only ploys, and that Mehmed was more of a threat to both monarchies than his father had been.Sphranzes, ch. 30. translated in Marios Philippides, The Fall of the Byzantine Empire: A Chronicle by George Sphrantzes, 1401‚Äì1477 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1980), pp. 58ff The Walls of Trebizond Trebizond could rely on its substantial fortifications to defend itself. While solid walls protected it on all sides, and along the eastern and western walls two deep ravines augmented the defenses, parts of the city lay outside them, such as the Meydan or marketplace, and the Genoese and Venetian quarters. These walls had withstood many previous sieges: in 1223, when the city walls had not been as extensive as in the mid-15th century, the defenders had defeated a Seljuk assault; not more than a few decades earlier, Shaykh Junayd had attempted to take the city by storm, yet with only a few soldiers the Emperor John had been able to hold him off.Rustam Shukurov, \\"The campaign of Shaykh Djunayd Safawi against Trebizond (1456 AD/860 AH)\\", Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, 17 (1993), pp. 127-140 Nevertheless, John reached out to make alliances. Donald Nicol lists some of them: the emirs of Sinope and Karaman, and the Christian kings of Georgia.Nicol, Last Centuries, p. 407 His brother and successor David is thought to have commissioned Michael Aligheri‚Äîand possibly the questionable Ludovico da Bologna‚Äîto travel to Western Europe in 1460 searching for friends and allies.This embassy is described in Anthony Bryer, \\"Ludovico da Bologna and the Georgian and Anatolian Embassy of 1460‚Äì1461\\", Bedi Kartlisa, 19‚Äì20 (1965), pp. 178‚Äì198 But the most powerful and reliable ally of the Emperors of Trebizond was the ruler of the Aq Qoyunlu (or White Sheep Turkomen), Uzun Hasan. The grandson of a princess of the Grand Komnenoi, Uzun Hasan had made the Aq Qoyunlu into the most powerful tribe of Turkmen by defeating their rivals the Black Sheep; he had heard of the beauty of the Emperor John's daughter Theodora Komnene (or Despina Khatun), and in return for her hand, Uzun Hasan pledged himself to protect her home city with his men, his money, and his person. In 1456, Ottoman troops under Hizir Pasha assaulted Trebizond. According to Laonikos Chalkokondyles, Hizir raided the countryside, even penetrating into the marketplace of Trebizond and capturing altogether about two thousand people. The city was deserted due to plague and likely to fall; John made his submission and agreed to pay an annual tribute of 2,000 gold pieces in return for Hizir freeing the captives he had taken. John sent his brother David to ratify the treaty with Mehmed II himself, which he did in 1458, but the Sultan raised the tribute to 3,000 gold pieces.Chalkokondyles 9.34; translated by Anthony Kaldellis, The Histories (Cambridge: Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, 2014), vol. 2 p. 313. Miller, Trebizond, p. 87 A tribute of 3,000 gold pieces each year must have proven too much for the revenues of the Empire, because either John or David approached their relative by marriage Uzun Hasan about transferring the allegiance of Trebizond from the Ottomans to him. Uzun Hasan agreed to this, and sent envoys to Mehmed II. However, these envoys not only asked for the tribute to be transferred to the Aq Qoyunlu, they demanded on behalf of their master that Mehmed resume payment of tribute Mehmed's grandfather was said to have sent to the Aq Qoyunlu.Franz Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time, edited by William C. Hickman and translated by Ralph Manheim (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 190f The sources disagree on exactly how Mehmed II answered, but both versions were ominous. In one version, he told the envoys \\"that it would not be long before they learned what they ought to expect from him.\\"Chalkokondyles, 9.70; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 353 In the other, Mehmed's response was, \\"Go in peace, and next year I will bring these things with me, and I will clear up the debt.\\"Doukas 45.10; translated by Harry J. Magoulias, Decline and Fall of Byzantium to the Ottoman Turks (Detroit: Wayne State University, 1975), p. 257  Mehmed advances  An Ottoman galley, circa 17th century In the spring of 1461, Mehmed fitted out a fleet comprising 200 galleys, and ten warships. At the same time, Mehmed crossed the Dardanelles to Prusa with the Army of Europe and assembled the Army of Asia; one authority estimates the combined force consisted of 80,000 infantry and 60,000 cavalry.John Freely, The Grand Turk: Sultan Mehmed II, Conqueror of Constantinople and Master of an Empire (New York: Overlook Press, 2009), p. 67 According to Doukas, as word of the Sultan's preparations circulated the inhabitants of places as far apart as Lykostomion (or Chilia Veche) at the mouth of the Danube, Caffa in the Crimea, Trebizond and Sinope, and the islands of the Aegean Sea as far south as Chios, Lesbos, and Rhodes, whether or not they had acknowledged his hegemony, all worried they would be his target.Doukas, 45.16; translated by Magoulias, Decline and Fall, p. 258 This appears to have been Mehmed's intent, for when later asked by a confidante where this force was destined, the Sultan scowled and said, \\"Be certain if I knew one hair of my beard knew my secret, I would pull it out and consign it to the flames.\\"Doukas, 45.15; translated by Magoulias, Decline and Fall, p. 258 Sinope surrenders Commanding the army, Mehmed led his land troops towards Ancyra, stopping on the way to visit the tombs of his father and ancestors. He had written the ruler of Sinope, Kem√¢leddin Ism√¢il Bey, to send his son Hasan to Ancyra, and the young man was already there when Mehmed reached the city, and received his overlord graciously.Babinger, Mehmed, pp. 191 Mehmed made his interests quickly known: according to Doukas, he informed Hasan, \\"Tell your father that I want Sinope, and if he surrenders the city freely, I will gladly reward him with the province of Philippopolis]. But if he refuses, then I will come quickly.\\"Doukas, 45.17; translated by Magoulias, Decline and Fall, p. 258 Despite the extensive fortifications of the city and its 400 cannon manned by 2,000 artillerymen, Ismail Bey caved in to Mehmed's demands; he settled on the lands Mehmed gave him in Thrace where he wrote a work on ritual prescriptions of Islam called Huulviyat-i Sultan, dying in 1479.Babinger, Mehmed, pp. 192 Mehmed had many reasons for seizing Sinope. It was well situated, and had good harbors. It also lay between Mehmed's territories and his ultimate objective, the city of Trebizond. Kritoboulos states that one major reason Mehmed took it for his own was that Hasan Uzun might seize it himself, and Mehmed knew \\"from many indications that he was plotting [to do that] in every way, and determined to seize it.\\"Critobulus, IV.22‚Äì23; translated by Charles T. Riggs, The History of Mehmed the Conqueror (Princeton: University Press, 1954), pp.167f Marching into Anatolia Leaving Sinope to his admiral Kasim Pasha to arrange its government, Mehmed led his armies inland. The march was difficult for the men. Konstantin Mihailoviƒá, who served in the Ottoman army in this campaign, writing his memoirs decades later recalled no landmarks between Sinope and Trebizond, yet the travails of the journey were still vivid in his memory: The path the Ottoman army took is not known. Kritoboulos states that Mehmed crossed the Taurus Mountains, becoming one of only four generals to have crossed them (the others being Alexander the Great, Pompey, and Timur).Kritoboulos, IV.26, 27; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 169 However, as his translator Charles Riggs points out, to Kritoboulos all of the mountain systems of Asia Minor were part of the Taurus.Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 168 n. 29 Doukas states that Mehmed led his soldiers across Armenia and the Phasis River, then ascended the Caucasus Mountains before reaching Trebizond.Doukas, 45.18; translated by Magoulias, Decline and Fall, p. 259 This makes no sense when one examines a map, for both the Phasis River and the Caucasus are far to the east of their destination. However, Mihailoviƒá wrote in his memoirs that the army marched into Georgia, so it is possible that Mehmed did make a show of force to intimidate the kings of Georgia from aiding their ally. Or this is further proof that the soldiers in the Sultan's army had as little idea where they were going as the hairs in the Sultan's beard. After 18 days of marching, one of the common soldiers made an attempt on the life of the Grand Vizier, Mahmud Pasha Angelovic. Two versions of this story exist: one in Kritoboulos and the other, moved from its proper place in the narrative through transmission, by Konstantin Mihailoviƒá.Kritoboulos, IV.32‚Äì36; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, pp. 171fMihailoviƒá, chapter 32; translated by Stolz (Memoirs of a Janissary, p. 62), who argues that this passage was moved to the campaign of 1471, which happened after Mihailoviƒá left the Ottoman service (p. xxviii) Kritoboulos states that no one had an explanation for this attempted murder, and before the assassin could be questioned he was \\"mercilessly cut to pieces by the army.\\" Mihailoviƒá, on the other hand, states that the assassin was acting under the orders of Uzun Hassan, and describes how the man was tortured for a week before he was executed, and his body was left \\"beside the road for the dogs or wolves to eat.\\" Both accounts agree that the Grand Vizier's wounds were minor, although Kritoboulos adds that Sultan Mehmed sent his personal physician, Yakub, to tend to Mahmud Pasha's wounds. The army continued for another 17 days.Kritoboulos, IV.36; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 172 Once the Sultan had passed Sivas and entered the lands of the Aq Qoyunlu, he sent Sarabdar Hasan Bey, the governor of the region of Amastris and Sebastea, forward to conquer a border fortress and lay waste to the lands around it. After continuing his march, the Sultan encountered Sara Khatun, mother of Uzun Hasan; she had come to negotiate a treaty of peace between the Sultan and her son. While Mehmed agreed to a peace treaty with Uzun Hasan, he refused to include Trebizond as a party to it.Babinger, Mehmed, pp. 192f Kasim Pasha invests Trebizond Meanwhile, the fleet under Admiral Kasim Pasha and assisted by a veteran seaman named Yakub, had left Sinope and came into sight of Trebizond. As was the common practice of the time, the crews of the ships consisted of armed men, and once the ships had landed these armed sailors disembarked and began to encircle the city. According to Chalkokondyles, the sailors set fire to the suburbs and set about besieging the city.Chalkokondyles, 9.74; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 359 However Doukas states that despite daily assaults, \\"no headway was made\\" to breaching the walls.Doukas, 45.19; translated by Magoulias, Decline and Fall, p. 259 The men of Kasim Pasha's fleet had besieged the walls of Trebizond for 32 days when the first units of the Sultan's army under his Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha Angelovic crossed over the Zigana Pass and took up positions at Skylolimne.  Negotiations  Trebizond with the Black Sea on the right Just as Constantine XI in 1453, Emperor David was given an opportunity before the Ottoman assault began in earnest, to capitulate. He could either surrender his city and not only save his life and wealth, as well as those of his courtiers, but also receive new estates that would provide him the same income; otherwise, further fighting could only end with the fall of Trebizond and David not only would lose his life and wealth, but any survivors would suffer the fate of a captured city.Chalkokondyles, 9.75; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 pp. 359‚Äì361. Doukas, 45.19; translated by Magoulias, Decline and Fall, p. 259; Kritoboulos, IV.41‚Äì44, translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, pp. 173f The details of how this offer was delivered varies in the primary sources. According to Doukas, the Sultan \\"delivered an ultimatum to the emperor\\". However, Doukas may have meant this in a general sense, not that Mehmed made the offer himself personally; Doukas omits many details about how the surrender was negotiated. Both Chalkokondyles and Kritoboulos state that his Grand Vizier, Mahmud Pasha Angelovic, arrived one day before the Sultan, and began the negotiations for surrender. Where Chalkokondyles and Kritoboulos differ is the role that George Amiroutzes, the protovestiarios of Trebizond, played in these negotiations. Chalkokondyles states that Mahmud Pasha negotiated with David through George Amiroutzes, whom Chalkokondyles describes as the Pasha's cousin;Chalkokondyles, 9.75-6; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 pp. 359‚Äì363 Kritoboulos omits all mention of Amiroutzes in these negotiations, stating that Mahmud Pasha sent as a messenger Thomas, the son of Katabolenos, to offer Emperor David this choice.Kritoboulos, IV.41; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, pp. 173f Modern historians consider Chalkokondyles' account as being closer to the truth, envisioning a drama where David weighed these two choices. The walls of Trebizond were massive and elaborate; David expected his relative Hassan Uzun to arrive at any moment to relieve the siege, or perhaps his ally the King of Georgia, or perhaps even both. Meanwhile, George Amiroutzes was at this side, allegedly suborned by his cousin to betray David, advising his emperor that surrender would be the prudent course, and reminding him what happened to Constantinople because Constantine refused Mehmed's offer; perhaps Amiroutzes even showed David letters from Sara Khatun informing him that no help would be forthcoming from that quarter.This is a conflation of the accounts of Runciman (pp. 174f), Miller (pp. 102‚Äì104), Babinger (pp. 194f), and Nicol (pp. 408f). In the end, the Emperor David Megas Komnenos chose to surrender his city and empire, and trust that Sultan Mehmed would be merciful. Here again the primary sources differ. According to Chalkokondyles, he sent Mahmud Pasha a message: he would surrender if given estates of equal value, and if Mehmed married his daughter.Chalkokondyles, 9.76; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 pp. 361‚Äì363 (Miller calls this last gesture, \\"the usual device of Imperial diplomacy\\".Miller, Trebizond, p. 103) When the Sultan arrived the next day with the rest of his army, Mahmud Pasha reported the developments. The news that David's wife had escaped to Georgia angered the Sultan, and at first declared he wanted to storm the city and enslave all of its inhabitants. But after further deliberations with Mahmud Pasha, Sultan Mehmed accepted the offered terms. In contrast Kritoboulos, who dedicated his history to Sultan Mehmed, simply describes the physical movement of the individuals involved: on the day Sultan Mehmed arrived, Thomas, son of Katabolenos, was sent before the gates of Trebizond to repeat the terms of surrender offered the day before. The people of Trebizond prepared \\"many splendid gifts\\" and a select group of \\"the very best men\\" emerged from the city and \\"made obeisance to the sultan, came to terms, exchanged oaths, and surrendered both the town and themselves to the Sultan.\\"Kritoboulos, IV.45; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 174 After these exchanges, Emperor David left the city with his children and courtiers and did homage to the Sultan; the latter \\"received him mildly and kindly, shook hands, and showed him appropriate honors\\", then \\"gave both him [David] and his children many kinds of gifts, as well as to his suite.\\" Kritoboulos, IV.46; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 175 On 15 August 1461, Sultan Mehmed II entered Trebizond, and the last capital of the Romaioi had fallen. Both Stephen Runciman and Franz Babinger note this date was the 200th anniversary of Michael VIII Palaiologos' recapture of Constantinople from the Latin Empire.Runciman, Fall of Constantinople, p. 175; Babinger, Mehmed, pp. 195f. Mehmed made a detailed inspection of the city, its defenses and its inhabitants, according to Miller, who then quotes Kritoboulos, \\"He [Mehmed] ascended to the citadel and the palace, and saw and admired the security of the one and the buildings and splendour of the other, and in every way he judged the city worthy of note.\\"Miller, Trebizond, p. 104 Mehmed converted the Panagia Chrysokephalos cathedral in the center of the city into Fatih Mosque, and in the church of Saint Eugenios he said his first prayer, thus giving the building its later name, Yeni Cuma (\\"New Friday\\"). Miller has collected two Turkish traditions about the fall of Trebizond. One tells how the citizens, expecting an army to arrive before dawn that would force the Sultan to lift the siege, agreed to surrender at cock-crow. However, on that occasion the roosters crowed in the small hours of the night, whereupon the Turks forced the city-dwellers to keep their word. The other describes how a girl, dressed in black, held out in the tower of the palace, and when all was lost, leaped to her death from its heights; consequently that tower was called Kara kƒ±zƒ±n sarayƒ± (\\"The Black Girl's palace\\").Miller, Trebizond, p. 106f  Aftermath  Cassone with the \\"Conquest of Trebizond\\" by Apollonio di Giovanni di Tommaso, on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, painted just after the fall of the city After taking possession of the city, Sultan Mehmed garrisoned his Janissaries in Trebizond's imperial castle; Kritobulos states that the garrison numbered 400.Kritoboulos, IV.50; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 175f. Chalkokondyless 9.76; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 pp. 361‚Äì3 He placed Emperor David, his family and his relatives, his officials and their families with all of their wealth on the Sultan's triremes which took them to Constantinople, where David and all 3 of his sons would be executed less than 2 years later and his daughter married off to the Grand Vizier Zagan Pasha.Doukas mentions David's \\"uncles and nephews\\": 45.19; translated by Magoulias, Decline and Fall, p. 259. Kritoboulos, IV.48; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 175. Chalkokondyles, 9.77; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 363 The rest of the inhabitants of Trebizond, however, were treated harshly. According to Pseudo-Chalkokondyles, they were divided into three groups: one group was forced to leave Trebizond and resettle in Constantinople; the next group became slaves either of the Sultan or of his dignitaries; and the last group were left to live in the countryside surrounding Trebizond, but not within its walls.Chalkokondyles, 9.79; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 365 Kritobulos states that only \\"some of the most influential men of the city\\" were forced to resettle in Constantinople, while stating nothing about the rest of the inhabitants.Kritoboulos, IV.48; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 175 The Sultan also took hundreds of children to become his personal slaves: while Kritobulos states that Mehmed took 1500 children of both sexes to be his slaves, Pseudo-Chalkokondyles writes only that he took 800 male children became recruits for his Janissaries, the elite Ottoman military unit, which required them to convert to Islam.Kritoboulos, IV.49; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 175. Chalkokondyles, 9.79; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 365. Babinger, Mehmed, p. 195 According to Chalkokondyles, Mehmed appointed Kasim Pasha to be governor of Trebizond and had Hizir accept the submission of the villages around the city and in Mesochaldia, home of the Kabasites clan. Although Chalkokondyles implies that these communities quickly acquiesced to Ottoman rule, Anthony Bryer has found evidence that some groups resisted their new Muslim overlords for as long as 10 years.Chalkokondykles, 9.77; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 363 Mehmed proceeded overland back to Constantinople. Kritobulos is brief about his return march: where he had detailed the Sultan's challenges on the outward march, Kritobulos writes only that he had sent Sara Khatun back to Uzun Hassan \\"with many gifts and honors\\";Kritoboulos IV.51; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 176 while Chalkokondyles notes the return journey was through \\"a strongly protected land and very inaccessible\\".Kritoboulos, IV.52; translated by Riggs, History of Mehmed, p. 176. Chalkokondyles, 9.77; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 363 According to a colophon in a copy of Petrarch's Africa, the Sultan's fleet returned by October 1461, their weapons and materiel almost unused.Ernest H.

The bill allows the town of Canton, Connecticut to take over two lapsed licenses from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in order to refurbish two old local dams. The dams would be used to produce hydroelectric power. Background This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the House Report 113-7, a public domain source. The Upper and Lower Collinsville Dams on the Farmington River were built to provide hydroelectric power to an ax factory, which was shut down in 1966. The dams have not produced power since that time, but continue to block upstream fish passage. On February 23, 2001, FERC issued original licenses to Summit Hydropower to redevelop hydroelectric power capacity at these dams. The Upper Collinsville Dam project was to have a generation capacity of 373 kilowatts, while the Lower Dam was to have a capacity of 920 kilowatts. As part of this licensing process, an environmental assessment was completed. The licenses required Summit to commence project construction within two years from the issuance of the licenses. Section 13 of the Federal Power Act requires licensees to commence construction of hydroelectric projects within the time fixed in the license, which shall be no more than two years from the issuance of the license, and authorizes the Commission to issue one extension of the deadline, for no more than two years. On November 26, 2002, FERC granted Summit a two-year extension to commence project construction at both sites, moving the deadline to February 23, 2005. Because construction did not commence by that date, the Commission sent Summit a notice of probable termination of the licenses on November 2, 2007. Summit did not respond to the notice. FERC terminated the licenses on December 4, 2007. Summit did not seek rehearing of the termination order. The town of Canton, Connecticut intends to proceed with the two hydroelectric projects that Summit originally had proposed. On January 9, 2009, FERC granted the town a preliminary permit to undertake the necessary feasibility studies. The town has stated that it intends to pursue Low Impact Hydropower Institute certification for the projects and to provide for fish passage. Identical legislation passed the House of Representatives in both the 111th and 112th Congresses as H.R. 4451 and H.R. 5625, respectively. H.R. 4451 was agreed to in the House by voice vote, under suspension of the rules, on June 16, 2010. H.R. 5625 passed the House by voice vote, under suspension of the rules, on June 26, 2012. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act would authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to: :(1) reinstate the license for either or each of the projects numbered 10822 and 10823, and :(2) extend for two years after the date on which either or each such project is reinstated the time period during which the licensee must commence project construction. The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act also directs the FERC to: :(1) transfer the reinstated licenses to the town of Canton, Connecticut, if it reinstates them and extends the time period during which the licensee is required to commence project construction; and :(2) complete an environmental assessment for the projects and update the environmental analysis performed during the licensing process. Finally, the Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act sets a deadline for the FERC to: :(1) reach a final decision concerning the projects, and :(2) complete the license transfer if it decides to reinstate either or both licenses. The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act provides a variety of exemptions from provisions of the Federal Power Act to the two projects listed in the bill. Procedural history The bill was introduced to the House by Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) on January 18, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. The bill had no co-sponsors and was not amended while in the House of Representatives. On February 12, 2013, the bill was passed under a motion to suspend the rules with a voice vote. This procedure typically indicates that a bill is broadly non-controversial. The bill was freshman Representative Esty's first bill in Congress. The bill was received by the United States Senate on February 13, 2013 and then referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent on May 22, 2014 after making an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The House voted on June 23, 2014 to agree to the Senate's amendment of the bill. The vote was 379-3 in Roll Call Vote 340. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on June 30, 2014. Public perception The bill received very little attention from the national press. It was briefly covered in local media of Canton, Connecticut and the surrounding areas. One op-ed writer was strongly opposed to the bill, claiming that it was locally known as the \\"Collinsville White Elephant Act.\\" The op-ed writer argued that rather than being a win-win situation, the new power plants would only serve to increase the electricity bills of local residents and provide additional revenue for the local government (potentially for them to misspend). He based this assessment on existing state electricity laws and problems associated with net metering.

Background Since early February, Chadian and French troops have occupied Kidal, using it as a key military base to house their troops and to renew counter-attacks on jihadists rebels in the Adrar des Ifoghas, situated just north of the city.http://www.aljazeera.com The city has been targeted on several occasions since then. On 5 April, after the French-led Operation Panther had ended, the Chadian army left the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains after weeks of battling Islamists to return their main base located on the outskirts of Kidal, bringing the number of troops there to 1,800. Attack On Friday morning 12 April 2013, a group of Chadian soldiers stationed in Kidal went to the local market to buy supplies. At around 9:50 am, according to eyewitnesses, once the group made its debut a suicide bomber detonated his explosive belts in a nearby market stall, while Chadian soldiers were passing by, killing three soldiers instantly and severely wounding four more in the explosion.Toute l'actualit√© du Nord-Mali According to residents, the incident occurred on a street commonly frequented by Chadian soldiers, located about 100 meters from the town market itself. According to witness accounts, the first bomber was said to have been neutralized before he could explode his belt, but the second one succeeded, letting of a deadly blast that destroyed part of the market and also injured five bystanders. However, Chadian and MNLA authorities claim only one suicide bomber took part in the attack itself. Immediately following the explosion, Chadian soldiers fired automatic weapons in the air, in an attempt to disperse the crowd from reaching the scene of the blast. According to Kidal's deputy mayor Abda Ag Kazina, the four soldiers were in a state of critical condition. The expected the death toll was likely to rise. Following the explosion, army checkpoints were placed at the four main entrances to Kidal, in fear that more suicide bombers can infiltrate the city, as easily as they did that morning. The same day, a Chadian security source issued a statement indicating that MOJWA (The Movement of Oneness and Jihadism in West Africa) was responsible for the suicide attack. According to inhabitants of the city, after the suicide bombing occurred, Chadian soldiers succumbed to fear and turned their weapons against civilians, firing live rounds of ammunition that injured five bystanders. A fourth Chadian soldier who was injured in the attack died overnight at a hospital in Gao. The three other wounded soldiers were evacuated to a military hospital Bamako, where from their military officials claim that they were in no life-threatening condition. The same day, a suspect in the name of Sidi Amar Ould Algor, ranked a colonel in the MNLA, was arrested by Chadian soldiers in connection to the earlier bombings, where he admitted he was the owner of the car that drove the future-suicide bomber to the Kidal market, where moments later he blew himself up. Tensions were raised following his arrest, as the MNLA never granted the Chadian army permission to take custody of one of its fighters.http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/2013045-parlement-tchad-tribut-guerre-mali- france-kidal-deby-dadnadji&ns;_fee=0 Aftermath Earlier on the same day as the suicide attack, a Chadian Air Force helicopter (probably a Mil Mi-17 Hip-H) crashed around 50 km northeast of the Malian town of Sevare, killing all 5 occupants, including a senior military officer.Malian military helicopter crash kills 5 as army prepares to lead war against jihadists (The Washington Post) Two days after the attack, Chadian president Idriss Deby announced Chad would withdraw its troops, citing the jihadist's guerrilla tactics.

That document stated UCLASS was to be ‚Äúa persistent, survivable carrier-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and precision strike asset.‚Äùhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R44131.pdf In preparing for the FY2014 budget submission, the JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement. On December 19, 2012, the JROC published memoranda 086-12 and 196‚Äì12, which significantly altered ‚Äúthe requirements for UCLASS, heavily favoring permissive airspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.‚Äù Dave Majumdar and Sam LaGrone, ‚ÄúUCLASS Timeline,‚Äù US Naval Institute News, 29 April 2014. The change in requirements appeared to be budget-driven. ‚ÄúThe reduction in strike capability of the Navy‚Äôs next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle was born of fiscal realities, said Dyke Weatherington, the Pentagon‚Äôs director of unmanned warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).‚ÄùSam LaGrone, ‚ÄúAUVSI 2013: UCLASS Requirements Modified Due to Budget Pressure,‚Äù USNI News, 14 August 2013 The Navy announced 14 August 2013 that four Preliminary Design Review (PDR) contracts were awarded for the UCLASS air vehicle segment. The four $15 million firm-fixed price contracts were awarded to Boeing Co., General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. The period of performance for the contracting efforts was approximately nine months. UCLASS program manager, Charlie Nava, said: \\"The PDRs are intended to inform the navy of the technical risk, cost and design maturity of the air segment (AS), and allows the industry teams to better understand the program‚Äôs requirements across the entire UCLASS system, to expeditiously deliver the unmanned carrier-based system to the fleet.\\" https://www.naval- technology.com/news/newsus-uclass-pdr-contracts/ In early 2014, the USN released draft requests for proposal (RFPs) to the four competitors.https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-navy-releases-draft- of-uclass-rfp-398373/ The RFPs were individualized for each company, so the exact specifications were publicly unknown. The RFPs were originally supposed to be issued in late 2012, but were delayed several times. The RFP was to mature the four designs up to a preliminary design review (PDR) over nine months and assess technical readiness.USN to release draft RFP for next UCLASS phase in August - Flightglobal.com, 10 July 2013 The draft RFP for technology development was delayed from August to September 2013. There was continuing debate over requirements and stealth, with General Atomics and Boeing expected to de-emphasize stealth in favor of endurance and payload, and Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin pitching tailless high-survivability designs.Uclass Draft RFP Slips As Stealth Debate Continues - Aviationweek.com, 13 August 2013 On 14 August 2013, the Navy awarded four development contracts to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman. Each contract was worth $15 million develop airframe designs.US Navy Moves Ahead To Develop Unmanned Carrier Aircraft - Defensenews.com, 14 August 2013US Navy awards UCLASS preliminary design contracts - Flightglobal.com, 15 August 2013 The Navy planned to arm the proposed UCLASS with weapons currently in the carrier air wing's inventory. With the priority of the aircraft on ISR, the airframe would accommodate a fifth-generation AESA radar and multiple intelligence (multi-int) sensors to include electro-optical/infrared sensors and full- motion video cameras to detect and track land and sea targets while armed with Joint Direct Attack Munitions.Navy Plans to Arm UCLASS with JDAMs - Defensetech.org, 21 November 2013 The Navy hinted at the possibility of using the UCLASS in air-to-air engagements as a \\"flying missile magazine\\" to supplement the F/A-18 Super Hornet and F-35C Lightning II as a type of \\"robotic wingman.\\" Its weapons bay could be filled with AIM-120 AMRAAMs and be remotely operated by an E-2D Hawkeye or F-35C flight leader, using their own sensors and human judgment to detect, track, and direct the UAV to engage an enemy aircraft. The Navy's Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) concept gives a common picture of the battle space to multiple air platforms through data-links, where any aircraft could fire on a target in their range that is being tracked by any sensor, so the forward deployed UCLASS would have its missiles targeted by another controller. With manned-unmanned teaming for air combat, a dedicated unmanned supersonic fighter may not be developed, as the greater cost of high-thrust propulsion and an airframe of similar size to a manned fighter would deliver a platform with comparable operating costs and still without an ability to engage on its own.Navy‚Äôs UCLASS Could Be Air to Air Fighter - News.USNI.org, 13 February 2014 NAVAIR planned to release the draft RFP by the end of March 2014. The Navy was optimizing the UCLASS for ISR and limited strike rather than long-range strike, along with a potential tanker role. On 18 February 2014, Congressman Randy Forbes wrote a letter to Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus advocating for the UCLASS to have aerial refueling, survivability, and payloads to make it effective in future contested air environments. Forbes requested the aircraft have broad-band stealth to survive integrated air defense systems and have the payload capacity to simultaneously support land and sea missions. Aerial refueling was also cited as a needed capability for responding to far-off threats and conducting missions outside the envelope of long-range threats, particularly the Chinese DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile.Forbes Writes in Support of a High End UCLASS - News.USNI.com, 19 February 2014 Requirements controversy Navy officials expressed concern that the original requirements of the UCLASS program had been degraded, as the original concept called for a stealthy, carrier-based, long-range unmanned combat aerial system (UCAS) with a large payload that could be refueled in-flight, but the altered version called for a UCAS that was modestly stealthy and emphasised intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions over lightly contested airspace, with a light secondary strike mission and no air refueling requirement, promoting affordability over survivability and endurance; the revised requirements were written to fill a gap in persistent, sea-based ISR. Stealth requirements were sharply reduced to lower costs, and original payload requirements calling for weapons bays to carry as many as 24 GBU-39 SDB 250 lb bombs, totaling a 6,000 lb of weapons, were reduced for a total payload of and only of weapons.Reduced capability leaves UCLASS vulnerable to budget axe - Flightglobal.com, 9 August 2013 The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) modified requirements during an 18 December 2012 meeting and did not consider them to be \\"relaxed,\\" but rather changed to consider \\"within the broader unmanned aircraft portfolio and included an assessment of the platform's performance, capability, survivability, and basing,\\" shifting to increase some performance areas and decrease others to get a mix.Official denies White House link to UCLASS revision - Flightglobal.com, 12 August 2013 JROC was reported to have changed the requirements in order to produce a replacement for the current drones used for Disposition Matrix missions that would not require host nation basing or permission, changing focus from a UAV capable of striking defended targets to keep costs down and maintain unmanned counterterrorism missions as a U.S. military option. Flying missions from sea- based carriers would have fewer restrictions than operating inside foreign countries, and irregular warfare missions will continue in the future to warrant further attention.\\"Why the JROC neutered the Navy‚Äôs UCLASS program.\\" - Flightglobal.com, 30 August 2013\\"Pentagon Altered UCLASS Requirements for Counterterrorism Mission.\\" - News.USNI.org, 29 August 2013 Congress and industry both agreed that the Navy had deviated significantly from the normal process for developing a new aircraft. For nearly three years, companies developed their candidates with company funds based on assumptions about the Navy's requirements without any guidance from the service. The Navy did not issue any aircraft performance specifications or draft requirements until the spring of 2013, so competitors tried to refit their aircraft for the preliminary design review phase. The lack of feedback was compounded by the shift of mission statements, from a long-range penetrating strike platform to long-duration orbits over permissive airspace. Endurance requirements of over 12 hours were especially hard to meet, as there are limitations of an aircraft's wingspan for holding fuel on the confined space of an aircraft carrier; the UCLASS had to maintain two orbits around the ship, or one orbit at a range of , with the ability to attack lightly-defended targets out to .ANALYSIS: Industry concerned about US Navy UCLASS requirements - Flightglobal.com, 23 September 2013 After pressure from Congress, industry, and the Government Accountability Office, the Navy took another look at the draft requirements for the UCLASS. They were scheduled to be released in October 2013 but were delayed. The main reason behind the internal strife was indecision over the future of the aircraft carrier fleet and their air wings, between better UAV-based ISR coverage integrated on board carriers in the near-future and integrating a new unmanned aircraft into the carrier air wing to make the carrier a more effective strike platform.US navy grapples with different UCLASS philosophies - Flightglobal.com, 29 September 2013 By December 2013, the UCLASS concept aircraft had shifted around significantly. Original requirements that were for a relatively simple ISR platform, were changed to a \\"heavy-end\\" ISR and strike aircraft with growth for weapons and sensors. It was planned to weigh , about the size of the F-14 Tomcat and much larger than the X-47B, and be around in length, longer than the F/A-18 Super Hornet, with endurance potentially up to 14 hours. Other roles were being considered such as an aerial refueling platform to extend the range of fighters, transferring of fuel and still staying airborne for up to 7.5 hours.Navy: UCLASS Will be Stealthy and ‚ÄòTomcat Size‚Äô - News.USNI.org, 23 December 2013 The four industry teams pushed back against the idea of a more capable UCLASS because the specifications would be significantly different from aircraft they developed for the PDR phase, and cost per aircraft would also increase from $35-$50 million to $100 million. Top-level UCLASS requirements of providing 24-hour persistent ISR coverage from the carrier at ‚Äútactically significant‚Äù ranges with limited strike capabilities at mid-to- long ranges remained fixed since spring 2013, though detailed specifications had been refined. Cost constraints drove Navy requirements for the UCLASS. One requirement that had remained constant was for the aircraft to conduct ISR orbits at tactically significant ranges for $150 million, meaning two air vehicles costing $75 million each can cover one orbit if they have an endurance of 14 hours.Cost Will Drive UCLASS Designs - News.USNI.org, 2 April 2014 Program continuation The U.S. Navy released the long-delayed RFP for the UCLASS on 17 April 2014, after Navy Secretary Ray Mabus signed the draft the previous day. The draft RFP was planned to be released in mid-2013, but was repeatedly delayed by disagreements over the proposed aircraft's stealth levels, ability to survive in contested airspace, and in-flight refueling ability. Though classified, available details showed original UCLASS specifications of continuously providing two ISR orbits at range over uncontested airspace with a light strike capability to eliminate targets of opportunity. The airframe would also have an open architecture design to be easily upgradable.US Navy releases draft of UCLASS RFP - Flightglobal.com, 17 April 2014Navy Issues Restricted UCLASS Draft Request for Proposal - News.USNI.org, 17 April 2014 The Navy was pursuing a path to at first use the UCLASS as a reconnaissance asset with proven standoff sensor technologies to observe targets in uncontested international airspace, while building in excess weight, space, and power capacity to add sensors and weapons and modify it later for use in contested airspace if needed.Confusion Surrounds Navy‚Äôs Carrier-Based Drone - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, May 2014 In July 2014, JROC launched a review of the UCLASS program in response to congressional criticism that Navy requirements were too narrowly focused to meet future mission threats. Although the Navy planned to weaponize the UCLASS incrementally, stealth and payload are things that must be built into an airframe and cannot be engineered in at a later time.Pentagon Reviews UCLASS Strike Capabilities - DoDBuzz.com, 10 July 2014 With the requirements again being reviewed, the planned release of the RFP in late July was suspended until the creation of a new joint Capabilities Development Document (CDD).Pentagon Delays Navy‚Äôs Carrier Drone Program - DoDBuzz.com, 11 July 2014 By mid-2014, the Navy had shifted the concept of the UCLASS for a third time. In 2006, it was envisioned to extend the inland reach of carriers beyond manned aircraft. In 2011, that was altered to a cheaper design that would act as a carrier ISR asset without the rest of the air wing that could also be used to hunt down terrorists. The third concept was an unmanned vehicle that would operate almost exclusively over the ocean, with initial missions including permissive airspace ISR and strike, then expanding to contested littoral and coastal ISR and strike and attacking enemy surface ships.Latest UCLASS Concept Emphasizes Maritime Roles - News.USNI.org, 17 July 2014 It has been speculated that one of the reasons for making the UCLASS more ISR-centric was to prevent it from taking the role of the F/A-XX, the manned future fighter replacement for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The F/A-XX is envisioned as a manned multi-role fighter, and the Navy cannot simultaneously develop the F-35C, UCLASS, and F/A-XX all as expensive strike assets.UCLASS Requirements Shifted To Preserve Navy‚Äôs Next Generation Fighter - News.USNI.org, 31 July 2014 On 18 December 2014, the Navy released a directive saying the UCLASS would be embedded in the same air wing that operates E-2C/D Hawkeye command and control aircraft, meaning a detachment of the E-2 wing, the commander of the E-2 unit on board the carrier, would have control over the unmanned platform during air operations and it would not act as a standalone unit or be operated under an F-35C wing.E-2D units will command future UCLASS fleet - Flightglobal.com, 7 January 2015 In the Navy's FY 2016 budget request, the planned fielding date of the UCLASS was pushed from 2020 to 2022‚Äì2023, and the RFP was again delayed as a result of the ongoing review of what roles the aircraft will perform.Navy Pushes UCLASS Fielding Date, Air Segment Request for Proposal - News.USNI.org, 2 February 2015 CBARS On 1 February 2016, after many delays over whether the UCLASS would specialize in strike or ISR roles, it was reported that a significant portion of the UCLASS effort would be directed to produce a Super Hornet‚Äìsized carrier-based aerial tanker as the Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS), with \\"a little ISR\\" and some capabilities to relay communications, with strike capabilities deferred to a future version of the aircraft. The Pentagon chose this in order to address the Navy's expected fighter shortfall by directing funds to buy additional Super Hornets and accelerate purchases and development of the F-35C, quickly getting naval stealth fighters into service, and extending their range to penetrate hostile airspace. It will likely be a less-stealthy wing‚Äìbody‚Äìtail configuration that will limit its ability to operate in contested airspace, be more sensitive to cost considerations, and favor Boeing and General Atomics submissions. Having the CBARS as the first carrier-based UAV provides a less complex bridge to the future F/A-XX, should it be an autonomous strike platform. It also addresses the carriers' need for an organic refueling aircraft, proposed as a mission for the UCLASS since 2014, freeing up the 20‚Äì30 percent of Super Hornets performing the mission in a more capable and cost effective manner than modifying the F-35, V-22 Osprey, and E-2D Hawkeye, or bringing the retired S-3 Viking back into service.US Navy‚Äôs Unmanned Jet Could Be a Tanker - Defensenews.com, 1 February 2016Pentagon to Navy: Convert UCLASS Program Into Unmanned Aerial Tanker, Accelerate F-35 Development, Buy More Super Hornets - News.USNI.org, 1 February 2016 Although initially designated the RAQ-25, the name was changed to the MQ-25 Stingray. Stealth requirements will be \\"descoped\\" and it may still be capable of firing missiles or dropping bombs from drop tank pylons, but surveillance and destroying targets will not be its main missions. Reducing the low-observable requirement is expected to make things easier for existing UCLASS competitors, and to open the competition to new entrants. An RFP for the air vehicle was issued in late 2016; Boeing was awarded the CBARS contract in August 2018.https://news.usni.org/2018/08/30/navy-picks-boeing-build-mq-25a-stingray- carrier-based-drone See also * UCAS-D References Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of the United States ","title":"Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike"},{"id":"39092730","text":"SS London Valour was a British merchant ship belonging to London & Overseas Freighters (LOF). She was built as an oil tanker in England in 1956 and converted into a bulk carrier in Italy in 1966. She was wrecked in a gale just outside the Port of Genoa in 1970, resulting in the deaths of 20 of the 58 people aboard. Tanker Furness Shipbuilding Co Ltd of Haverton Hill-on- Tees built London Valour in 1956 as an oil tanker. She was launched on 12 June and completed on 6 December. She was LOF's first steam turbine-driven tanker. She had twin steam turbines producing a total of 8,200 shaft horsepower between them. They were double reduction-geared onto a single shaft to drive a single screw. The turbines were built by Richardsons Westgarth & Company of Hartlepool, which was part of the same group as Furness Shipbuilding. London Valour was a typical tanker of her era, with an accommodation block and her single funnel aft and her bridge on a larger accommodation block amidships. As built, she had two goalpost masts: one forward, just aft of her bow, and the other astern of her midships accommodation block. London Valour was the first of five sister ships ordered from Furness. The next two, SS London Tradition and SS London Resolution, were launched and completed in 1957. The final two were built for London and Overseas Tankers: a company in which LOF held a 50% share. SS Overseas Pioneer was launched and completed in 1958; SS Overseas Explorer was launched in 1958 and completed in 1959. For several years the five sisters traded profitably, but in the early 1960s LOF's competitors started to operate new supertankers of about : six times the size of Valour or her sisters, and with much lower operating costs per ton. LOF continued to get cargoes on the spot market for its tanker fleet, but at scant profit. Bulk carrier LOF and LOT therefore had the sisters converted into bulk carriers, and awarded the work to Industria Navali Meccaniche Affini (INMA) of La Spezia, Italy. London Resolution was converted first, in October ‚Äì December 1965. Work on London Harmony started on 18 December 1966 and was completed on 23 April 1967. London Tradition followed in March ‚Äì July 1967, then Overseas Explorer in April ‚Äì October 1967 and Overseas Pioneer in April ‚Äì August 1968. The conversion changed the appearance of the ships. London Valour and her sisters each now had four goalpost masts ‚Äì two forward of the bridge and two abaft. Each goalpost mast carried four derricks for handling cargo. Another effect of the conversions was that the tonnage of each ship was reduced by a few hundred tons. Shipwreck The USSR had chartered LOF ships since 1960, starting with oil tankers. On 2 April 1970 London Valour left the Soviet port of Novorossiysk in the Black Sea with a cargo of 23,606 tons of iron ore for Genoa in northern Italy. On 7 April she arrived off the Port of Genoa and she anchored in the roads about south of the Duca di Galliera harbour mole to await a berth. As the bulk carrier waited at anchor the Chief Engineer, Sam Mitchell, used the time to carry out maintenance work on the ship's auxiliary engines. His men completed this work on the morning of 9 April. A few hours later, at about 1200 hrs, the atmospheric pressure had fallen to . At first the wind remained low, about Force 2 or 3, blowing from the southeast. Then at about 1300 hrs the wind backed to southwest and grew stronger. London Valours Master, Captain Donald Muir, held a meeting on the bridge but considered the ship was not in particular danger. In particular, Muir did not tell his deck officers that as the auxiliary engines had been down for maintenance, the engine room would need to be ordered to have the main engines on standby if a need arose to move the ship. Muir then rejoined his wife in his cabin, leaving Second Officer Donald Allan MacIsaac on watch. The wind intensified, causing London Valour to drag her anchor and driving her towards the shore. At about 1330 hrs the first officer, Robert Kitchener, saw from his cabin that the ship was getting closer to the mole. He raised a general alarm, and Second Officer MacIsaac alerted Captain Muir and the engineer on watch. Chief Engineer Mitchell tried to start the steam turbines to enable the ship to move away from the mole. At 1350 hrs atmospheric pressure had fallen to 742mm of mercury and the wind had risen to a Force 8 gale. At 1422 hrs the waves and wind drove London Valour aground. At 1430 hrs London Valour transmitted a Mayday radio message. Rescue attempts Two pilots were on duty at Genoa's pilot station: Captains Giovanni Santagata and Aldo Baffo. At about 1435 hrs they saw London Valour was within to of the mole and notified the harbour master's office. Santagata also alerted the tugboat station, which ordered the tug Forte to sea to assist. At about 1440 hrs Santagata and Baffo joined the crew of the pilot boat Teti and put to sea. At about 1445 hrs Teti called London Valour by VHF radio but got no reply. The ship was now about from the mole and her crew had donned lifejackets. At about 1455 hrs winds and to waves drove the ship broadside onto the rocks alongside the mole. At 1500 hrs the Harbour Master's office put Captain Santagata in charge of the rescue operation and ordered him to keep Tetis radio on channel 16, the internationally recognised distress channel. 58 people were trapped aboard London Valour: her British officers, Indian and Filipino crew, and the wives of two of the British officers. They were in two groups, one on each accommodation block, separated by waves now breaking over the deck. Tetis helmsman, Barone, positioned the pilot boat south of the ship, between her two accommodation blocks and within of her and the pilot boat now made VHF contact with London Valour. A coastguard boat of the same Super Speranza class and year (1968) as CP 233 A Guardia Costiera (\\"Coast Guard\\") boat now put to sea to join the rescue. CP 233 was a ' (\\"Super Hope Class\\") coastguard boat, long and just over , commanded by Captain Giuliano Telmon. Within the next two hours Telmon and his crew succeeded in rescuing 25 or 26 survivors. At 1545 Captain Baffo had to pilot the cruise ship MV Canguro Verde to her berth. Teti put to sea to meet Canguro Verde, but Santagata continued to direct the rescue operation from the pilot boat. The gale and waves continued to drive the ship on shore. London Valours double bottom, which contained her bunker fuel, had ruptured and was leaking thick black oil into the sea. Chief Engineer Mitchell tried to prepare one of the lifeboats for launch but he was thrown into the rough sea. The sea was covered with oil and d√©bris and it was 90 minutes before Mitchell was rescued. Nevertheless, the only injury he sustained was to his arm as he was pulled to safety. Second Officer MacIsaac took command of the after part of the ship. He got a covered inflatable life raft launched and ordered Third Officer Meurig Caffery and two other men into it. Teti cast a line to the raft, towed it to safety and transferred two of the men to another pilot boat. Third Officer Caffery asked Santagata to let him remain aboard Teti to help with the rescue. Caffery looked to be in good condition so Santagata agreed. The forward and midships part of the ship was against the mole, but her stern was clear of it. The ship broke her back abaft her bridge, further separating the two groups aboard. MacIsaac remained in command of the after part, acted with courage and initiative and saved many of his shipmates, but became exhausted by his efforts and did not himself survive. As the after part was not on the rocks, the braver men were able to jump from the stern into the sea and be rescued by the craft that were standing by. At 1615 hrs Teti returned to sea and sighted an exhausted man in the water and covered with fuel oil. Caffery dived into the sea and supported the man, and Tetis crew threw them a lifebuoy on a line. The sea was tossing Teti so violently that her crew could not haul the two men aboard, so she towed them to calmer water inside the mole. Tetis engineer, Fanciulli, tried to haul the men aboard but because of the oil they kept slipping from his grasp. The tug India came to assist. Her Captain, Ragone, passed a rope around the two men, and Teti took the rope and towed the two men ashore. At 1640 hrs Teti put to sea a third time. She found another survivor in the water, threw him a lifebelt and towed him to sheltered water behind the mole, where the tug Aleghro under Captain Fanciulli recovered him from the water and took him ashore. Teti then went back out to sea and recovered two corpses from the water. At 1745 another pilot boat, the Preve, approached Teti and signalled her back to within the shelter of the mole. There the two boats came alongside each other and exchanged crews. Captain Tanlongo and his crew of two pilots, a helmsman and an engineer from Preve took over Teti and took her back out to sea. At 1815 Santagata, Baffo and their crew took Preve to sea. Tanlongo radioed from Teti that he had seen three survivors on the rocks. Preve searched all along the rocks but found no-one. The Vigili del Fuoco di Genova (\\"Genovese Fire Service\\") ashore fired a breeches buoy from the mole to the midships accommodation block. This was made fast on the ship, and the firemen hauled three Indian crewmen to safety. Captain Muir persuaded his wife Dorothy to go next, but the buoy jammed and flung Mrs Muir from the harness to her death on the rocks below. Some sources suggest that the breaking of the ship into two coincided with the fire service's attempt to winch Mrs Muir to safety, that this caused the breeches buoy's nylon rope to flex and this was what caused it first to jam and then to fling Mrs Muir onto the rocks. A fireman, Giuliano Macchi, tried several times to reach her but without success. Captain Muir leapt after his wife into the sea. He was later seen in the water with one leg seriously injured, and then was not seen again. A huge wave swept the midships accommodation block, washing away the Chief Officer, Third Engineer, Radio Officer and his wife. The crew of a fire service helicopter threw a lifebelt to the Third Engineer, Arthur Carey, who managed to catch it and was rescued. The Chief Officer landed on the monkey island on top of London Valours bridge, and was later rescued by the harbour master's boat. The Radio Officer and his wife, Eric and Nan Hill, died in the heavy sea. All of those who survived were rescued before 1800 hrs. By that time 34 men were in hospital, four were in an hotel, eight were known to be dead and 12 were still missing. By 0930 hrs the next morning 12 bodies had been recovered and eight people remained missing. Inspection, salvage and disposal After the disaster, divers submerged to inspect London Valours hull. They found her anchor chain intact and paid out to a length of . The anchor rested on the sea floor at a depth of about . However, a steel cable had snagged its flukes, causing them to point upwards and preventing them from embedding themselves in the mud. This was what had prevented the anchor from holding the ship. Salvage work started in November 1970 with the safe removal of much of the ship's cargo. As the ship's back was broken she was cut in two through her number two hold. On 11 October 1971 the Dutch company Smit Tak International Bergingsbedriff (\\"Smit Tak International Salvage Service\\") refloated the after part by filling its holds with Styrofoam balls. Permission was given to sink the wreck on the Balearic Abyssal Plain east of Menorca, as it is below the surface of the Mediterranean and the depth would minimise risk of pollution from the wreck. Smit Tak's plan was to tow the after part to its destination and then scuttle it with dynamite. On 12 October the tug Oceanic Vortex slowly towed the after part clear of the mole and handed it over to two Italian tugs, Torregrande and Genua. Torregrande was carrying the Dutch salvage crew and was in charge of the remainder of the operation. The hulk was low in the water, drawing , and showing little more than its goalpost masts above the water. For all these reasons, plus the lack of its bow, the hulk had very poor hydrodynamics. Torregrande and Genua between them developed 4,500 horsepower but managed to make only headway. On 12 October the weather was good but on 13 October it deteriorated, with strong squalls making it harder for the tug crews to see the hulk. The hulk sank lower in the water and the tugs struggled to maintain any headway. At about 0130 hrs on 14 October Captain Negro of the Genua radioed his concerns to Captain Gatti of the Torregrande. Gatti asked the Dutch party to authorise the tugs to recover as much as possible of the towing cables and then cast the hulk loose before it sank. At about 0230 hrs Torregrande hauled in its steel cable and began to recover its nylon towing rope. Gatti then cut the nylon rope and cast the hulk adrift. The hulk sank again on 14 October at 0258 hrs. The tugs had managed to tow it only about from Genoa. It sank about south of Imperia and west of Cap Corse, and lies at a depth of . The forward part remained on the rocks at the mole in Genoa. It was broken up in situ, starting in May 1972. Investigations and findings On 23 June 1970 Paolo Cavezzali, Italy's Under-secretary of State for the Merchant Marine made a statement to the Italian Senate. Cavezzali stated that an initial investigation found that errors by three of London Valours officers \\"could not be ruled out\\". #The initial investigation suggested that Captain Muir may not have made sufficient arrangements for watchkeeping while at anchor and may not have checked whether his arrangements were effective. #The initial investigation suggested that Second Officer MacIsaac may have not have observed the ship's barometer and monitor the VHF radio, may have not have observed the ship's position in relation to the land and may have failed to signal the engine room in time to start the main engines. #The initial investigation suggested that Radio Officer Hill may not have monitored radio traffic with due diligence and may not have taken account of weather warnings of the impending storm. Cavezzali cited the initial investigation as alleging that the officers were not always on the bridge and had not remarked on the falling atmospheric pressure. They had neither established the ship's position in relation to fixed points on the shore nor used the radar to monitor the ship's distance from the shore. More seriously, no-one aboard was monitoring the VHF radio and no-one took account of a weather report received from Malta. The initial investigation also alleged that no-one raised the alarm at 1400 hrs when the storm developed (This is contradicted by another source that states the Chief Officer raised the general alarm at 1330 hrs when he saw the ship was getting closer to the shore.) The initial investigation also alleged that the radio officer did not listen to the VHF radio at the scheduled times. Two years later in Britain the Royal Courts of Justice considered the shipwreck under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. The Court sat in Westminster in 1972 on 19, 20, 21, 24 and 25 April and issued its judgement on 17 May, which attributed the stranding and loss to \\"the wrongful act or default\\" of the late Captain Muir. Honours and monuments Italy awarded the ' (\\"Marine Medal of Merit\\") to five participants in the rescue. The harbour master Giuliano Telmon and fire service helicopter pilot Captain Rinaldo Enrico received gold medals. The pilots Giovanni Santagata and Aldo Baffo received silver medals. A third pilot, Giuseppe Fioretti, received a bronze medal. Two Genovese Fire Service Divers (Vigili del Fuoco di Genova), Severino Ferrazzin and Luigi Neni, received bronze metals. Severino Ferrazzin in 1977 was awarded the title of Knight of the Italian Republic for his intervention in rescue, at sea, the steamer. In April 1973 Britain awarded the Medal for Saving Life at Sea to two of London Valours officers. Meurig Caffery received the bronze medal for diving from Teti and saving a man in the water. Donald MacIsaac was posthumously awarded the silver medal for his command of the after part of the ship, which \\"undoubtedly saved many lives\\" from the \\"ferocious seas sweeping across the vessel's decks\\". LOF presented London Valours wheel to Genoa's Ospedale San Martino (\\"St Martin's Hospital\\") in gratitude for its treatment of the injured. The company presented her Red Ensign and small bell to the harbour master of the Port of Genoa. LOF presented her main bell to the Church of England Church of the Holy Ghost in Genoa, where it is now the Sanctus bell. In popular culture The Italian singer and songwriter Fabrizio De Andr√© wrote and sang a song Parlando del naufragio della London Valour (\\"Talking about the sinking of London Valour\\"). His studio recording of the song is included on his album Rimini released in 1978.

It is composed of aggregate, cement and water. Composition of concrete varies to suit for different applications desired. Even size of the aggregate can influence mechanical properties of concrete to a great extent. Peculiarities of Concrete Response to tensile and compressive loading Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension. When tensile loads are applied, concrete undergoes fracture easily. The reason behind this phenomenon can be explained as follows. The aggregates in concrete are capable of taking compressive stresses so that concrete withstands compressive loading. But during tensile loading cracks are formed which separates the cement particles which hold the aggregates together. This separation of cement particles causes the entire structure to fail as crack propagates. This problem in concrete is resolved by the introduction of reinforcing components such as metallic bars, ceramic fibres etc. These components act as a skeleton of the entire structure and are capable of holding aggregates under tensile loading. This is known as Reinforcement of Concrete. Material Properties Concrete may be referred to as a brittle material. This is because concrete's behaviour under loading is completely different from that of ductile materials like steel. But actually concrete differs from ideal brittle materials in many aspects. In modern fracture mechanics concrete is considered as a quasi-brittle material.Fracture Mechanics, Fundamentals and Applications, 3rd edition by T.L.Anderson Quasi-brittle materials possess considerable hardness which is similar to ceramic hardness, so often it is called ceramic hardness. The reason for ceramic hardness can be explained on the basis of subcritical cracking that happens during loading of concrete. Subcritical cracking in concrete which precedes ultimate failure, results in nonlinear StressStrain response and Rcurve behaviour. So concrete obtains hardness from subcritical failure.Fracture Mechanics by Gross Dietmar and Thomas Seelig Also concrete has a heterogeneous structure due to uneven composition of ingredients in it. This also complicates the analysis of concrete by producing misleading results. LEFM and Concrete Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics yields reliable results in the field of ductile materials like steel. Most of the experiments and theories in fracture mechanics are formulated taking ductile materials as object of interest. But if we compare the salient features in LEFM with results derived from the testing of concrete, we may find it irrelevant and sometimes trivial. For example, LEFM permits infinite stress at crack tip. This makes no sense in real analysis of concrete where the stress at crack tip is fixed. And LEFM fails to calculate stress at crack tip precisely. So we need some other ways to find out what is stress at crack tip and distribution stress near crack tip. LEFM cannot answer many phenomenon exhibited by concrete. Some examples are * Size Effect (some properties are strongly dependent on size of specimen selected). * Unobjectivity of Finite Element analysis due to mesh size dependence. * Concept of Fracture energy or Crack energy is not known in LEFM. * Inability to explain strain softening or quasi softening in concrete. Fracture Process Zone (FPZ) in concrete In LEFMPA, during cracking, no specific region is mentioned in between the area which is cracked and that which is not. But it is evident that in concrete, there is some intermediate space between cracked and uncracked portion. This region is defined as the Fracture Process Zone (FPZ). FPZ consists of micro cracks which are minute individual cracks situated nearer to crack tip. As the crack propagates these micro cracks merge and becomes a single structure to give continuity to the already existing crack. So indeed, FPZ acts as a bridging zone between cracked region and uncracked region. Analysis of this zone deserves special notice because it is very helpful to predict the propagation of crack and ultimate failure in concrete. In steel (ductile) FPZ is very small and therefore strain hardening dominates over strain softening. Also due to small FPZ, crack tip can easily be distinguished from uncracked metal. And in ductile materials FPZ is a yielding zone. When we consider FPZ in concrete, we find that FPZ is sufficiently large and contains micro cracks. And cohesive pressure still remains in the region. So strain softening is prevalent in this region. Due to the presence of comparatively large FPZ, locating a precise crack tip is not possible in concrete. :f_t = Ultimate strength :w = crack width :Area under the curve = Fracture Energy Pre-peak and post-peak response of steel and concrete If we plot stress (Pascal) vs. strain (percentage deformation) characteristics of a material, the maximum stress up to which the material can be loaded is known as peak value (f_t). The behaviour of concrete and steel can be compared to understand the difference in their fracture characteristics. For this a strain controlled loading of un-notched specimen of each materials can be done. From the observations we can draw these conclusions:Lecture Notes in Fracture Mechanics by Victor E. Saouma Pre-peak # Steel exhibits linear elastic response up to yield stress and strain approximately 0.1%. After that it undergoes plastic deformation due internal dislocations up to a strain corresponding to 25%. # Concrete exhibits linear response to a stress value: 0.6 f_t (60% of peak stress), then after internal microcracking induces plastic response up to peak stress value (f_t). This peak value is observed at a strain of approximately 0.01%. Post-peak #Metals behaviour after peak value of stress is still a dilemma to scientists. After this peak value necking complicates the analysis and it is of no practical usefulness. # In post peak zone concrete exhibits additional strains. We can observe a localized crack and elastic unloading in this region. Also a strain cannot be properly defined at the crack, we may prefer a stress crack opening displacement (œÉ-COD) model for the purpose of analysis. Fracture mechanics of concrete  Concept of fracture energy Fracture energy is defined as the energy required to open unit area of crack surface. It is a material property and does not depend on size of structure. This can be well understood from the definition that it is defined for a unit area and thus influence of size is removed. Fracture energy can be expressed as the sum of surface creation energy and surface separation energy. Fracture energy found to be increasing as we approach crack tip. Fracture energy is a function of displacement and not strain. Fracture energy deserves prime role in determining ultimate stress at crack tip. Mesh Size Dependence In Finite Element Method analysis of concrete, if mesh size is varied, then entire result varies according to it. This is called mesh size dependence. If mesh size is higher, then the structure can withstand more stress. But such results obtained from FEM analysis contradict real case. Size effect In classical Fracture Mechanics, critical stress value is considered as a material property. So it is same for a particular material of any shape and size. But in practice, it is observed that, in some materials like plain concrete size has a strong influence on critical stress value.Ba≈æant, Z.P., and Planas, J. (1998). Fracture and Size Effect in Concrete and Other Quasibrittle Materials. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida So fracture mechanics of concrete consider critical stress value a material property as well as a size dependent parameter. Ba≈æant's size effect relation :\\\\sigma=\\\\tau/‚àö(1+{d/\\\\lambda\\\\delta})Ba≈æant, Z. P., and Pang, S.-D. (2006) ‚ÄúMechanics based statistics of failure risk of quasibrittle structures and size effect on safety factors.‚Äù Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci., USA 103 (25), pp. 9434‚Äì9439 where :\\\\sigma= Critical stress :\\\\tau = tensile strength :d = size of specimen :\\\\lambda = empirical constant :\\\\delta = maximum aggregate size This clearly proves that material size and even the component size like aggregate size can influence cracking of concrete. Computational models for fracture analysis Because of the heterogeneous nature of concrete, it responds to already existing crack testing models \\"anomaly\\". And it is evident that alteration of existing models was required to answer the unique fracture mechanics characteristics of concrete. Earlier models ;Dugdale Model :Major assumptions of this model were: :* A plastic zone is present near the crack tip. :* Critical stress value is a constant and it is equal to yield stress across the crack. ;Barenblatt Model :* A plastic zone is present near the crack tip. :* Critical stress value is varying along with deformation produced. The main drawback of both these models was negligence of concept of fracture energy.Concrete Fracture Models: Testing and Practices by Zdenek P Ba≈æant Fictitious crack model or Hillerborg model The model proposed by Hillerborg in 1976, was the first model to analyse concrete fracture making use of the fracture energy concept. In this model, Hillerborg describes two crack regions namely, * True or physical crack * Fictitious crack or fracture process zone (FPZ) ;True crack region :is the outer most part where cracking process is completed and no stresses can be propagated through this zone. COD is comparatively high and more or less constant. :In this region we have both stress discontinuity and displacement discontinuity. ;Fracture process zone : situated just interior to the True crack region where crack is initiating and propagating. In this zone at crack tip, we have peak stress = tensile strength of concrete.Ba≈æant, Z. P. (2004) ‚ÄúScaling theory of quaisbrittle structural failure.‚Äù Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci., USA 101 (37), 13397-13399 Along the FPZ stress is continuous and displacement is discontinuous. Crack propagation in FPZ starts when critical stress is equal to tensile strength of concrete and as crack starts propagating, stress does not become zero. Using the plot of fracture energy versus crack width, we can calculate critical stress at any point including crack tip. So one of the major drawbacks of LEFM is overcome using fracture energy approach. Direction of crack propagation can also be determined by identifying the direction of maximum energy release rate. ;Concept of characteristic length :Hillerborg defined a parameter called Hillerborg characteristic length(l) which is numerically expressed as, ::l=\\\\frac{EG}{\\\\sigma^2} where ::l= characteristic length ::E= Young's Modulus ::G = fracture energy ::\\\\sigma = critical stress value Hillerborg characteristic length can be used to predict brittleness of a material. As magnitude of characteristic length decreases brittle nature dominates and vice versa. Crack band model Proposed by Bazant and Oh in 1983, this theory can well attribute materials whose homogeneous nature changes over a certain range randomly. So we select any particular more or less homogeneous volume for the purpose of analysis. Hence we can determine the stresses and strains. The size of this region should be several times that of maximum aggregate. Otherwise the data obtained will be of no physical significance. Fracture Process Zone is modelled with bands of smeared crack. And to overcome the Finite Element Method unobjectivity, we use cracking criterion of fracture energy. Crack width is estimated as the product of crack band width and element strain. In finite element analysis, the crack band width is the element size of fracture process path.

He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency. He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration. He dissented from the view that Russia interfered with the 2016 US election. More specifically, he was critical of the view that Russia hacked the DNC server.  Biography  Binney grew up in rural Pennsylvania and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the Pennsylvania State University in 1970. He said that he volunteered for the Army during the Vietnam era in order to select work that would interest him rather than be drafted and have no input. He was found to have strong aptitudes for mathematics, analysis, and code breaking, and served from 1965 to 1969 in the Army Security Agency before going to the NSA in 1970. Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability). After retiring from the NSA, he founded, together with fellow NSA whistleblower J. Kirk Wiebe, Entity Mapping, LLC, a private intelligence agency to market their analysis program to government agencies.  Whistleblowing  Binney sitting in the offices of Democracy Now! in New York City on May 2012, prior to appearing with hosts Amy Goodman, Juan Gonzalez, and guest Jacob Appelbaum In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting \\"millions and millions of dollars\\" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that \\"it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had\\" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread. He was furious that the NSA hadn't uncovered the 9/11 plot and stated that intercepts it had collected but not analyzed likely would have garnered timely attention with his leaner more focused system.  After the NSA  After he left the NSA in 2001, Binney was one of several people investigated as part of an inquiry into a 2005 expos√© by The New York Times on the agency's warrantless eavesdropping program. Binney was cleared of wrongdoing after three interviews with FBI agents beginning in March 2007, but in early July 2007, in an unannounced early morning raid, a dozen agents armed with rifles appeared at his house, one of whom entered the bathroom and pointed his gun at Binney, who was taking a shower. The FBI confiscated a desktop computer, disks, and personal and business records. The NSA revoked his security clearance, forcing him to close a business he ran with former colleagues at a loss of a reported $300,000 in annual income. The FBI raided the homes of Wiebe and Loomis, as well as House Intelligence Committee staffer Diane Roark, the same morning. Several months later the FBI raided the home of then still active NSA executive Thomas Andrews Drake who had also contacted DoD IG, but anonymously with confidentiality assured. The Assistant Inspector General, John Crane, in charge of the Whistleblower Program, suspecting his superiors provided confidential information to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), challenged them, was eventually forced from his position, and subsequently himself became a public whistleblower. The punitive treatment of Binney, Drake, and the other whistleblowers also led Edward Snowden to go public with his revelations rather than report through the internal whistleblower program. In 2012, Binney and his co-plaintiffs went to federal court to retrieve the confiscated items.  Allegations on intercepts  Binney is known for making the claim that the NSA collects and stores information about every U.S. communication. Binney was invited as a witness by the NSA commission of the German Bundestag. On July 3, 2014 Der Spiegel wrote, he said that the NSA wanted to have information about everything. In Binney's view this is a totalitarian approach, which had previously been seen only in dictatorships. Binney stated that the goal was to control people. Meanwhile, he said that it is possible in principle to monitor the whole population, abroad and in the U.S., which in his view contradicts the United States Constitution. In August 2014, Binney was among the signatories of an open letter by the group Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity to German chancellor Angela Merkel in which they urged the Chancellor to be suspicious of U.S. intelligence regarding the alleged invasion by Russia in Eastern Ukraine. In the open letter, the group said: > [A]ccusations of a major Russian \\"invasion\\" of Ukraine appear not to be > supported by reliable intelligence. Rather, the \\"intelligence\\" seems to be > of the same dubious, politically \\"fixed\\" kind used 12 years ago to \\"justify\\" > the U.S.-led attack on Iraq.  Russian Interference in the 2016 election  Binney claims the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election is false, and that the Democratic National Committee e-mails were leaked by an insider instead. He appeared on Fox News at least ten times between September 2016 and November 2017 to promote this theory. Binney said that the \\"intelligence community wasn't being honest here\\". He has been a frequent guest on RT and Fox News and has been frequently cited on Breitbart News. In November 2017, it was reported that a month earlier, Binney had met with CIA Director Mike Pompeo at the behest of President Trump. In July 2018, Duncan Campbell published an opinion piece supporting the point of view that Binney had been persuaded by a pro-Kremlin disinformant that the theft of the DNC emails was an inside job, and not the work of Russian agents (contrary to the findings of the US intelligence community). The disinformation agent manipulated metadata in the files released by Guccifer 2.0 (whom the US intelligence community identifies as a Russian military intelligence operation) to prove that the documents came from a computer in the Eastern United States, not Russia. Binney subsequently appeared multiple times on Fox News to advocate for his inside job theory. Binney has said he voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, calling Hillary Clinton a \\"war monger\\". Role in apparent release of the Nunes Memo On January 23, 2018, Binney made an appearance on InfoWarshttps://www.mediamatters.org/alex- jones/alex-jones-tries-and-fails-pass-publicly-available-document-house-gops- secret-russia in connection with the Nunes memo, a Congressional document alleging irregularities in the application of the FISA Act, which at that time was not publicly available although its potential release was a topic of public debate. During the show, host Alex Jones announced that Binney had been able to provide him with the actual memo, and the purported leaked document was shown on air. However, this was in fact a public document that had been available on the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence since at least May 2017. The actual Nunes memo was released February 2, 2018.  Documentary film  Binney's story is recounted in A Good American, a documentary film.

She was a member of the first subgroup of the class, and saw service throughout World War II. Construction and commissioning Hambledon was ordered under the 1939 Naval Building Programme from Swan Hunter, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 21 March 1939. She was laid down on 8 or 9 June 1939 and launched on 12 December 1939. She was completed on 8 June 1940, and immediately commissioned, under the command of Commander Stephen Hope Carlill, RN with the pennant number L37. Service history Home waters, 1940 Upon commissioning, Hambledon immediately began acceptance trials, which she completed successfully later in June 1940. She then proceeded to Portland for work-ups, during which she deployed with the British destroyers , , , and to escort the minelayers , , , and of the 1st Minelaying Squadron as they laid the first section of the Northern Barrage north of North Rona in Operation SN1. On 12 July 1940, increased German activity in the English Channel prompted the Royal Navy to transfer her work-ups north to Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, and she completed them there later in July 1940 and was assigned to a flotilla based at Sheerness, charged with patrol and convoy defence duties in the English Channel and along the east coast of Great Britain. On 31 August 1940 she and her sister ship rendered assistance to Royal Navy ships that had struck mines in the North Sea off the coast of the Netherlands, rescuing the survivors of the sunken destroyer and standing by the badly damaged destroyer , which had lost her bow in a mine explosion, until tugs arrived to tow her to safety. In October 1940, Hambledon was selected to participate in Operation Lucid, a plan to use fire ships to attack German invasion barges in ports in northern France, but bad weather forced the Royal Navy to abort the operation on several occasions and it was never carried out. On 7 October 1940, during operations related to Lucid, she suffered major damage to her after structure from the explosion of an acoustic mine in the English Channel off South Foreland at position , losing one rating killed and two injured. The destroyer towed her to Sheerness, and she was taken to Chatham Dockyard for repairs, which lasted until May 1941, and the installation of Type 285 fire-control radar for her armament. Home waters and Atlantic, 1941‚Äì1943 In May 1941, with her repairs completed, Hambledon passed her post-repair trials and on 14 May 1941 took up convoy escort and anti-invasion patrol duties in the North Sea with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Harwich, England, which she continued through October 1942. In March 1942 she was \\"adopted\\" by Hambledon Rural District Council as the result of a successful Warship Week national savings campaign run by nine of the Surrey villages that formed part of the then Hambledon Rural District council. When convoy traffic along the east coast of Great Britain was reduced to free escorts for use elsewhere, Hambledon was selected for detached service in October 1942. Accordingly, in November 1942 she deployed to the North Atlantic Ocean to escort convoys bringing troops and equipment to Gibraltar for Operation Torch, the Allied amphibious invasion of North Africa, that month, and suffered slight damage from a torpedo explosion on 12 November 1942. In December 1942 she returned to her escort and patrol duties at Harwich, which in 1943 began to include interception of German S-boat ‚Äì known to the Allies as \\"E-boat\\" ‚Äì motor torpedo boats in the North Sea to prevent them from attacking Allied convoys. Mediterranean, 1943 In June 1943, the Royal Navy selected Hambledon for participation in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, and transferred her to the 58th Destroyer Division. She proceeded from Harwich to the River Clyde, where on 21 June 1943 she joined the light cruiser , the destroyers Viceroy, , , and , and the escort destroyers , , , , , , and as escort for the military Convoy WS 31/KMF 17 for the Clyde-Gibraltar leg of its voyage. On 26 June 1943, the convoys divided and the Gibraltar-based destroyers , , and and escort destroyer took over the escort of WS 31 as it continued its voyage to Freetown, Sierra Leone, on its way to the Middle East, while Blencanthra and her consorts pressed on to Gibraltar as the escort of KMF 17, arriving there on 28 June 1943.HMS BLENCATHRA (L 24) - Type I, Hunt-class Escort Destroyer While at Gibraltar, Hambledon was transferred to Escort Group V, in which she joined Blankney, Blencathra, Brecon, and Brissenden. The escort group escorted Convoy KMF 18, which departed Gibraltar on 7 July 1943 bound for the Sicily invasion, and, detaching temporarily on 9 July 1943 to refuel, brought the convoy to the BARK WEST assault area on 10 July 1943, the day of the initial landings. Hambledon then operated on patrol and escort duty in support of Husky until being released from the operation on 31 July 1943 and reassigned to the 58th Destroyer Division based at Malta for patrol and escort duty in the central Mediterranean Sea. In August 1943, Hambledon was selected to carry Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Cunningham for Operation Avalanche, the Allied landings at Salerno on the mainland of Italy planned for September 1943. On 9 September 1943, she embarked Cunningham and United States Army General Dwight D. Eisenhower at Bizerta, Tunisia, to take them to Malta to observe the surrender of the Italian Royal Navys battlefleet there, and was present when the surrender took place on 10 September 1943. She departed Malta later that day to take part in the Salerno landings, with Cunningham embarked. Released from Operation Avalanche in October 1943, Hambledon next operated in the Aegean Sea to assist in the unsuccessful Allied attempt to defend the Italian-held islands of Leros and Kos against invasion by German forces during the Dodecanese Campaign. After the campaign ended in an Allied defeat, Hambledon resumed patrol and convoy defence operations in the central Mediterranean in November 1943. Mediterranean, 1944 Early in 1944, Hambledon transferred to Naples, Italy, from which she patrolled the west coast of Italy and supported Allied ground operations. On 29 March 1944, Hambledon, Blencathra, and their sister ship departed Naples to assist the destroyers , , and in hunting the German submarine , which they had detected with asdic in the Tyrrhenian Sea northeast of Palermo, Sicily, near Filicudi, 135 nautical miles (250 km) south of Naples. They attacked U-223 with depth charges until Laforey ordered them to halt, then continued to track U-223 for several hours until she was forced to surface in the early hours of 30 March 1944 after 27 hours of attack by depth charges and Hedgehog antisubmarine mortars. Hambledon joined the other ships in illuminating U-223 with searchlights and sinking her with gunfire at position with the loss of 23 of the submarines crew, leaving 27 survivors, but not before U-223 sank Laforey with an acoustic torpedo with the loss of 182 lives, leaving 69 survivors. Hambledon assisted in rescuing Laforeys survivors, then took aboard 14 of U-223s survivors, two of whom died before Hambledon could reach port. In April 1944, the Royal Navy selected Hambledon, Blencathra, and Mendip to participate in Operation Neptune, the initial assault phase of the Allied invasion of Normandy scheduled for early June 1944. Accordingly, Hambledon departed Naples in May 1944 bound for the United Kingdom. Home waters, 1944‚Äì1945 Upon arrival in the United Kingdom in May 1944, Hambledon was assigned to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Sheerness, designated to escort assault Convoy G16 to the coast of Normandy for the initial landing and then to remain off the beachhead to defend it from German naval attack as part of Force G. In early June 1944, she joined the other forces allocated to Force G in the west Solent. U.S. President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes wave at HMS Hambledon while on board on the River Scheldt as they head to the Potsdam Conference on 15 July 1945 After the landings were delayed from 5 June to 6 June due to bad weather, Hambledon departed for the landings along with the escort destroyer on 5 June 1944 as escort for Convoy G16, which consisted of nine infantry landing craft and two rescue craft. The convoy arrived off Gold Beach on 6 June 1944 and put its troops ashore, with Hambledon supporting the landing by bombarding German shore defences. Later in the day, Hambledon steamed back to the Solent to escort Convoy EBP 2 bringing reinforcements and supplies to the beachhead, fighting an action against German S-boats south of the Isle of Wight along the way. On 7 June 1944, she joined the 112th Escort Group ‚Äì made up of the frigates and and the sloop ‚Äì to escort EBP 2 ‚Äì five troop transports carrying United States Army troops for discharge on Utah Beach, the headquarters ship for Mulberry B, and three smaller merchant ships ‚Äì to Utah Beach, where the convoy arrived on 8 June 1944. Later that day, she was released from convoy escort duty and assigned to patrol and interception duties to defend the beachhead from German naval attack. In July 1944, Hambledon was released from beachhead defence duties and reported to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich for convoy defence operations in the North Sea and English Channel, which she conducted until March 1945. In March 1945, she was reassigned to escort convoys crossing the North Sea between the United Kingdom and ports in Belgium and the Netherlands and to patrol duties in the Nore Command and Dover areas. In April 1945, her focus again shifted to convoy defence and patrol operations in the southern North Sea and English Channel, and on 12 April 1945 she and the frigate fought an action with German S-boats which were laying mines off Flushing. After Germany surrendered in early May 1945, Hambledon was assigned to the Nore Local Flotilla. From June to August 1945 she operated on training duties and in support of re-occupation forces. She remained in the Nore Command until decommissioned and placed in reserve in December 1945. Reserve and disposal Hambledon was in reserve in the Harwich Division of the Reserve Fleet from 1946 until 1953, when she was transferred to Barrow-in- Furness.Critchley, Mike, \\"British Warships Since 1945: Part 3: Destroyers\\", Maritime Books: Liskeard, UK, 1982. , page 24 In 1955 she was stripped, hulked, and placed on the disposal list. The United Kingdom sold her in August 1957 to BISCO for scrapping by Clayton and Davie at Dunston-on-Tyne. Taken under tow, she arrived at the shipbreakers yard in September 1957 and was scrapped.

An influential jazz musician and teacher, Downing made significant contributions to the African-American jazz community in Florida. He was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen and became the first African-American Commissioner of the St. Petersburg Housing Authority in Florida, as well as the first African American to play in the St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestra.  Early life  Downing was born in 1916 in Jacksonville, Florida, the middle child of Ernest & Mary Downing. His father, a railroad porter and street musician, and his mother, a seamstress, adhered to their idea of the American dream and pushed for the best life they could provide for their family, developing a close kinship with one another and a high reverence for the Baptist faith. He had an affinity and curiosity for music from a very young age. His relationship with the piano that later led to his love of jazz developed when his cousin, who had been taking piano lessons, convinced him to practice the piano in her place. After his parents discovered the switch, they acquired a piano and arranged lessons for him at the age of five. Downing continued his lessons throughout elementary and middle school, and in the beginning of his high school years he organized his first band, The Ten Clouds of Joy. After graduating from high school, he chose to attend Alabama State College, later transferring to Florida Agricultural & Mechanical College where he met his future wife Bernice \\"Bunny\\" Gause. After graduating from college, Downing moved to St. Petersburg Florida where he began his teaching career at Gibbs High School, the African American high school of the community. Downing taught at Gibbs for three years before he was drafted into the United States Army Air Force (USAAF), the United States' aviation appendage during World War II. Upon returning from the war he taught music at St. Petersburg College Clearwater Campus for many years while playing local clubs. Downing continued to play the piano throughout his lifetime up until dying of heart failure in 2000.  Military  Al's deployment formally formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 447th Bombardment Group, but history would remember these groups as the Tuskegee Airmen. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first ever African American pilots of the military and for those that comprised this group, although understandably apprehensive about the idea of war, were excited by the idea of African American pilots. Stationed at the Tuskegee Army Airfield, also known as Sharpe Field and a predominantly black base, in Tuskegee, Alabama, with Bunny back home in St. Petersburg, Al qualified for flight school, but a medical examination designated him \\"grounded\\" due to asthma. Ever resourceful as the military is, however, Al was made use of as a clerk in the offices of the command center. Not content with being a clerk, Al applied for officer training and in 1944 completed officer candidate school making him a Lieutenant. Shortly after becoming a Lieutenant he was made the adjutant of the 613th Air Force Band. However, when the Tuskegee Army Airfield was closed Al was transferred to Lockbourne Air Base and was shortly after promoted to squadron commander and leader of the 613th Army Air Force Band where he was responsible for organizing a musical program to \\"establish a good working relationship\\" with the white citizens of Columbus, Ohio and stymie their disdain for the newly transferred Tuskegee Airmen whom they regarded as trouble makers after the highly gossiped Freeman Field confrontation, a series of incidences where Tuskegee Airmen, stationed at Freeman Army Airfield, attempted to integrate an all-white officers' club, which resulted in multiple arrests of African American officers. As a solution, Al created a talent show that required one squadron to entertain a different squadron every week. This proved to be successful and, with the help of Private First Class Calvin Manuel, a professional actor before entering the service, a variety show was created called Operation Enjoyment. Operation Enjoyment was so successful that \\"Colonel Joseph F. Goetz, chief of the entertainment section of the USAF‚Ä¶persuaded the Air Force to sponsor it on a tour of bases throughout the United States.\\" The show consisted of magic and comedic acts, dancing, singing, and ended with a \\"thrilling piano battle between Private First Class [Ivory] Mitchel and Lieutenant Al Downing, in which the entire cast sang the Army Air Corps song, \\"Into The Wild Blue Yonder\\". Though he enjoyed his service to his country, his passion for music was his true calling. After 21 years of service, and reaching the rank of Major through his work for the 613th Air Force Band, Al officially retired from the Military in 1961 and returned to St. Petersburg where he reestablished his teaching career at Gibbs Junior College, now St. Petersburg College, where he taught piano, organ, music theory, brass, woodwind, instrumental percussion techniques, and applied music courses.  The All Stars  After returning to St. Petersburg, Al was approached by Ernie Calhoun, the leader of a well-known local jazz band named \\"Ernie Calhoun and the Soul Brothers\\". Ernie offered Al a job as the organist for his band, and Al accepted. The abilities of a good organist were highly sought after in the musical community in the 1960s. Al's organ of choice, a B-3 Hammond, increased his value as everyone wanted a B-3 Hammond. The partnership established between Al and Ernie helped introduce Al to the extensive network of local musicians. Shortly after joining \\"Ernie Calhoun and the Soul Brothers\\", Al started his own band \\"The Allstars\\", which consisted of a wide array of musical talents of different ages, musical backgrounds, and race, but with a common interest in jazz. For Al, it wasn't about who you were, what color you were, or what religion you were; it was about what instrument you played. This lack of racial boundaries in Al's musical world helped bridge a few gaps in the musical community, ultimately adding to the promotion of integration.  Al Downing Tampa Bay Jazz Association  In 1971 the integration of white and black schools was initiated county wide in Pinellas County and though this eliminated, to some degree, racial boundaries in education and networking, there were still very few outlets in the community for jazz. Though there were many job opportunities for musicians, jazz was seemingly getting snuffed out. Al's newly formulated band \\"The All Stars\\" saw the deficiency of jazz first hand and to help bring new life to jazz Al, started the \\"Allegro Music Society\\". The Allegro Music Society, although passionately pursued, was shortly disassembled as political pressure from the local musician's union discouraged membership to the Allegro Music Society and threatened the survival of local bands, as the union was, in essence, a band's accreditation at the time. Most clubs would not hire a band without the backing of the local musicians union. Still passionate about creating outlets for jazz musicians, Al reorganized a concept for another organization that would keep jazz alive for both prospective and current musicians and to reintroduce people to the golden days of jazz. The result was the formation of the Al Downing Florida Jazz Association in 1981. Unlike the Allegro Music Society, the Al Downing Florida Jazz Association was successful in formulating a functional and sustainable association that provided outlets for jazz musicians as well as education opportunities for those who wanted to learn about jazz. In 1984 the Al Downing Florida Jazz Association absorbed the Tampa Bay Jazz Society creating one entity for the advancement of jazz. When the two organizations merged proposition to drop the Al Downing name from the title was quickly rebuked and denied, as it was clear that Al Downing was truly the \\"Ambassador of Jazz\\", a title given to him by The Clearwater Jazz Holiday Foundation.

In most species, the parents excavate a \\"nest\\" in the bottom, ranging from a depression to actual tunnels, but a few species use surfaces of stones or sunken wood. The eggs are laid in the nest, and the eggs and fry are guarded by both parents. Coptodon mostly feed on plant-material (both phytoplankton and higher plants) and detritus with smaller quantities of invertebrates, but in Lake Bermin and Lake Ejagham there has been a level of segregation among the species, including specialists that mostly feed on sponges (C. gutturosa and C. spongotroktis), small fish (C. ejagham) or zooplankton (C. fusiforme). Conservation status C. rendalli and C. zillii have been introduced widely outside their native ranges and are considered invasive, but most remaining members of the genus (including four endemics in Lake Ejagham and nine in Lake Bermin) have small ranges and many species are seriously threatened. Considered data deficient by the IUCN, the virtually unknown C. ismailiaensis may be synonym of the equally poorly known Oreochromis ismailiaensis, or the widespread and common C. zillii. Regardless, the only known habitat of C. ismailiaensis (and Oreochromis ismailiaensis) in Egypt appears to have disappeared entirely.

It was selected as the closing film at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The film is partly based on Project Coast, the program for biological and chemical weapons of the South African apartheid regime, and the book Zulu by author Caryl F√©rey, winner of the French Grand Prix for Best Crime Novel of 2008. Plot As a child in Cape Town, Ali Sokhela (Forest Whitaker) witnesses the murder of his father and rape of his mother Josephina by marauders. On that day, Ali was also rendered a eunuch after a dog savaged his genitals. In present day, Ali has become a homicide detective of the South African Police, partnered with fellow detectives Brian Epkeen (Orlando Bloom) and Dan Fletcher (Conrad Kemp). The men are called to investigate the murder of Judith Botha, a young woman found in the local Botanical Gardens, only to uncover that Judith was alive and her best friend Nicole Weiss was the victim, having been found with Judith‚Äôs ID and had been bludgeoned to death. While interviewed, Judith claimed that Nicole had spent the evening with her boyfriend. While driving home, Ali encounters two young boys violently fighting, but they both flee after he defuses the fight. Ali finds a powdered substance at the scene, which he later uncovers was a new form of toke, a psychologically manipulating drug. Meanwhile, Brian was revealed to be indulged in a divorce from his ex-wife Ruby, while his teenage son David had grown distant from him, due to Brian's bachelor lifestyle, heavy debt and addiction to gambling and alcohol. Ali confronts exotic dancer Zina at her club \\"Sundance\\", but she identifies Nicole's boyfriend as Stan Kwalana, a local drug dealer, while the department secretary Janet traces Nicole's phone to Muizenberg Beach. Upon arriving, Ali, Brian and Dan are attacked by a band of criminals, who proceed to mortally wound Dan with a machete, though Ali and Brian kill the remnants; Dan later dies in hospital, leaving his wife Claire grief stricken and she cuts connections with the CTPD. Following Dan's funeral, Ali is assigned by CTPD Captain Paul Kruger to investigate Cat, a crime lord with connections to Dan's killers, but he denies knowledge of the crime. Cat was later revealed to be the manufacturer of the toke and Stan, having overdosed on the drug had unintentionally killed Nicole in a fit of blind rage, was his unwilling accomplice. The following day, another woman Kate Montgomery, the wife of a famous jazz musician, is found murdered in the same fashion as Nicole on Long Island Beach; Ali and Brian uncover the Zulu warrior message \\"Bazukala\\" carved upon her chest. Later that same day, Stan's severed head is recovered. Ali and Brian once again confronted Cat, but suddenly, the same criminals from Muizenberg Beach attack his hideout, killing several of his men; Ali and Brian pursued the criminals, but they are killed by Cat's thugs and Ali is wounded during the pursuit. Brian returns to the precinct and uncovered that Stan had been labelled as Nicole and Kate's killer, but Brian refused to believe the case was closed. Later, Brian visits local ranger Tara, who revealed she had seen a military jeep parked outside of Muizenberg Beach at the time of Dan's murder. Without support of the CTPD, Brian and Janet privately investigated together, uncovering the identity of Doctor Joost Opperman, a former scientist of \\"Project Coast\\", which intended to unleash biological weaponry to be used against the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but many scientists had also vowed to eradicate the black population of South Africa, believing them to be responsible for the uprising of crime and poverty; Brian suspected Opperman had manufactured the toke to achieve his goal. Aware of their connections to Project Coast, Brian infiltrates the headquarters of the DPS, a private militia headed by Frank De Beer; Brian labels one of the vehicles as the same one found at Muizenberg Beach the day of Dan's death, confirming their involvement with Opperman. Later that day, Josephine is murdered in her home by Cat, having been informed of the investigation by Ali. Upon hearing of his mother's death, Ali learns from Cat's mistress that he had retreated to the Namib Desert with Opperman; fuelled with rage, Ali flies to Namibia to hunt down Cat. Upon gathering the evidence to prosecute Opperman, Brian received word that Ruby and her husband Rick had been taken captive by De Beer, demanding Brian relinquish the evidence in exchange for their lives. Upon arriving, Brian is captured and beaten, while Rick is executed for attempting to bribe his own freedom. After De Beer departs for Namibia, Brian breaks free and kills the resident agents, saving Ruby; the evidence confirmed that De Beer had murdered Kate, another user of the toke to frame Stan for their deeds, while Cat had killed Stan on Opperman's orders. Ali and Brian arrive outside Oppermn's headquarters in the Namib Desert, where a shootout begins; in the process, Brian captures and arrests De Beer, while Ali kills Cat, but is shot in the process. Opperman flees across the desert, but Ali pursues him until morning, leading each other to exhaustion. Upon capturing him, Ali bludgeons Opperman to death, before succumbing to his wound and dying. Brian and a police unit arrive on the scene and recover Ali's body to be buried. Upon returning to Cape Town, Brian buries Ali and reinstates himself at the CTPD, while proceeding to better his life by making amends with David and having the tombstone of his father repaired.

Rosbash is a professor and researcher at Brandeis University and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Rosbash's research group cloned the Drosophila period gene in 1984 and proposed the Transcription Translation Negative Feedback Loop for circadian clocks in 1990. In 1998, they discovered the cycle gene, clock gene, and cryptochrome photoreceptor in Drosophila through the use of forward genetics, by first identifying the phenotype of a mutant and then determining the genetics behind the mutation. Rosbash was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. Along with Michael W. Young and Jeffrey C. Hall, he was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\\".  Life  Michael Rosbash was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His parents, Hilde and Alfred Rosbash, were Jewish refugees who left Nazi Germany in 1938.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=132882242 His father was a cantor, which, in Judaism, is a person who chants worship services. Rosbash's family moved to Boston when he was two years old, and he has been an avid Red Sox fan ever since. Initially, Rosbash was interested in mathematics but an undergraduate biology course at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and a summer of working in Norman Davidson's lab steered him towards biological research. Rosbash graduated from Caltech in 1965 with a degree in chemistry, spent a year at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris on the Fulbright Scholarship, and obtained a doctoral degree in biophysics in 1970 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Sheldon Penman. After spending three years on a postdoctoral fellowship in genetics at the University of Edinburgh, Rosbash joined the Brandeis University faculty in 1974. Rosbash is married to fellow scientist Nadja Abovich and he has a stepdaughter named Paula and daughter named Tanya.  Research  Rosbash's research initially focused on the metabolism and processing of mRNA; mRNA is the molecular link between DNA and protein. After arriving at Brandeis, Rosbash collaborated with co-worker Jeffrey Hall and investigated the genetic influences on circadian rhythms of the internal biological clock. They used Drosophila melanogaster to study patterns of activity and rest. In 1984, Rosbash and Hall cloned the first Drosophila clock gene, period. Following work done by post-doctoral fellow, Paul Hardin, in discovering that period mRNA and its associated protein (PER) had fluctuating levels during the circadian cycle, in 1990 they proposed a Transcription Translation Negative Feedback Loop (TTFL) model as the basis of the circadian clock. Following this proposal, they looked into the elements that make up other parts of the clock. In May 1998, Rosbash et al. found a homolog for mammalian Clock that performed the same function of activating the transcription of per and tim that they proceeded to call dClock. Also in May 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered in Drosophila the clock gene cycle, a homolog of the mammalian bmal1 gene. In November 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered the cryb Drosophila mutant, which lead to the conclusion that cryptochrome protein is involved in circadian photoreception.  Chronology of major discoveries  *1984: Cloned the Drosophila period gene *1990: Proposed the Transcription Translation Negative Feedback Loop for circadian clocks *1998: Identified the Drosophila Clock Gene *1998: Identified the Drosophila Cycle Gene *1998: Identified cryptochrome as a Drosophila Circadian Photoreceptor *1999: Identified LNV Neurons as the Principal Drosophila Circadian Pacemaker  mRNA research  Rosbash began studying mRNA processing as a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His work in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed the enzymes, proteins, and subcellular organelles and their convergence upon mRNA in a specific order in order to translate mRNA into proteins. Missteps in this process have been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, so this work is essential for better understanding and treatment of diseases.  Discovery of circadian TTFL in Drosophila  In 1990, Rosbash, Hall, and Hardin discovered the role of the period gene (per) in the Drosophila' circadian oscillator. They found that PER protein levels fluctuate in light dark cycles, and these fluctuations persist in constant darkness. Similarly, per mRNA abundance also has rhythmic expression that entrains to light dark cycles. In the fly head, per mRNA levels oscillate in both 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycles as well as in constant darkness. Per mRNA levels peaked at the beginning of the subjective night followed by a peak in PER protein levels about 6 hours later. Mutated per genes affected the cycling of per mRNA. From this experimental data, Rosbash, Hall, and Hardin hypothesized that PER protein is involved in a negative feedback loop that controls per mRNA levels, and that this transcription-translation feedback loop is a central feature of the Drosophila circadian clock. They also looked at two other single missense period mutations, perS and perL1. These mutations cause the peak of the evening activity to occur earlier and later, respectively, compared to wildtype per+ flies. They found that RNA levels for perS and perL1 also display clear rhythmicity. Like locomotor activity the peak expression is shifted earlier for perS and later for perL1. They transformed the period0 null mutation flies with a 7.2-kb piece of functional per DNA, and measured per mRNA levels at the per0 locus and new locus. Following transformation, per mRNA levels were rhythmic at both the original and new locus. The per0 locus was able to transcribe normal per mRNA and translate normal PER protein, meaning that rhythmicity was rescued by functional PER protein transcribed and translated from the 7.2-kb piece of per DNA. There is a feedback loop at play in which cycling of PER protein levels at the new locus feeds back to dictate cycling of per mRNA levels at the original per0 locus. In 1992, Rosbash again collaborated with Jeffrey Hall and Paul Hardin to more closely examine the mechanisms of the TTFL. They wondered specifically about the regulation of period mRNA level fluctuations, and found that per mRNA levels were transcriptionally regulated. This was supported by the evidence that per precursor RNA cycles with the same phase as mature transcripts, and oscillate with respect to Zeitgeber Time (ZT). Other evidence for transcriptional regulation is that per gene promoter is sufficient to confer cycling to heterologous mRNA.  Challenges to the TTFL model in Drosophila The Akhilesh Reddy group has shown, using a range of unbiased -omics techniques (RNA-sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics) that Drosophila S2 cells display circadian molecular rhythms. These cells do not express known \\"clock genes\\" including per and tim. Introduction of PER and TIM proteins into the cells does not cause rhythmicity of these cells as read out by abundance or phosphorylation of PER and TIM proteins. These cells were thus regarded as \\"clock-less\\" by the fly field until now. These findings substantiate the work above in demonstrating the TTFL model of the fly clockwork cannot explain the generation of circadian rhythms.  Discovery of Drosophila Clock Gene  A likely homolog of the previously discovered mouse gene Clock was identified by Rosbash et al. by cloning of the Drosophila gene defined by the Jrk mutation. This gene was given the name Drosophila Clock. dClock has been shown to interact directly with the per and tim E-boxes and contributes to the circadian transcription of these genes. The Jrk mutation disrupts the transcription cycling of per and tim. It also results in completely arrhythmic behavior in constant darkness for homozygous mutants and about half demonstrated arrhythmic behavior in heterozygotes. The Jrk homozygotes expressed low, non-cycling levels of per and tim mRNA as well as PER and TIM protein. From this, it was concluded that the behavioral arrhythmicity in Jrk was due to a defect in the transcription of the per and tim. This indicated that dClock was involved in the transcriptional activation of per and tim.  Discovery of Drosophila Cycle Gene  In 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered the novel clock gene cycle, a homolog of the mammalian Bmal1 gene. Homozygous cycle0 mutants are arrhythmic in locomotor activity and heterozygous cycle0/+ flies have robust rhythms with an altered period of rhythmicity. Western blot analysis shows that homozygous cycle0 mutants have very little PER and TIM protein as well as low per and tim mRNA levels. This indicates that lack of cycle leads to decreased transcription of per and tim genes. Meiotic mapping placed cyc on the third chromosome. They discovered bHLH-PAS domains in cyc, indicating protein binding and DNA binding functions.  Discovery of cryptochrome as a Drosophila circadian photoreceptor  In 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered a Drosophila mutant exhibiting flat, non-oscillating levels of per and tim mRNA, due to a null mutation in the cryptochrome gene. This mutation was dubbed crybaby, or cryb. The failure of cryb mutants to synchronize to light dark cycles indicates that cryptochrome‚Äôs normal function involves circadian photoreception.  LNV neurons as principal Drosophila circadian pacemaker  In Drosophila, certain lateral neurons (LNs) have been shown to be important for circadian rhythms, including dorsal (LNd) and ventral (LNV) neurons. LNV neurons express PDF (pigment dispersion factor), which was initially hypothesized to be a clock output signal. Mutants for the pdf neuropeptide gene (pdf01) as well as flies selectively ablated for LNV produced similar behavioral responses. Both entrained to external light cues, but were largely arrhythmic in constant conditions. Some flies in each cases showed weak free-running rhythmicity. These results lead the researchers to believe that LNV neurons were the critical circadian pacemaker neurons and that PDF was the principal circadian transmitter.  Current research  In more recent years, Rosbash has been working on the brain-neuronal aspects of circadian rhythms. Seven anatomically distinct neuronal groups have been identified that all express the core clock genes. However, the mRNAs appear to be expressed in a circadian and neuron-specific manner, which his lab has taken interest in determining whether this provides a link to the distinct functions of certain neuronal groups. He has also researched the effects of light on certain neuronal groups and has found that one subgroup is light- sensitive to lights on (dawn) and another is light-sensitive to lights off (dusk). The dawn cells have been shown to promote arousal while the dusk cells promote sleep. Today, Rosbash continues to research mRNA processing and the genetic mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms. He has also published an amusing reflection on his life in science.

They focused on the unique effects of antiarrhythmic drugs in ischemic tissue, ion sensitive electrodes to understand the heart's electrical activity, and cost-effectiveness in heart disease. He has published over 170 papers. Academic medicine Kupersmith joined the faculty of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in 1974, where he rose to the rank of professor and initiated one of the early clinical cardiac electrophysiology sections and a clinical pharmacology section. Kupersmith then became chief of cardiology and Cooke Professor of Medicine at the University of Louisville, and professor and chairperson of the department of medicine at Michigan State University. In 1997, he was appointed dean of the School of Medicine at Texas Tech University and of its Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Vice President for clinical affairs, and CEO of its faculty practice. He was involved in the initial efforts to establish what is now the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso and initiated a 4/year MD/MBA program, the second in the U.S.https://www.ttuhsc.edu/medicine/admissions/mdmba.aspx Kupersmith has served as a site visit chair for the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), was a member of the AAMC Task Force on Fraud and Abuse, and was elected to the Governing Council, Medical School Section, of the American Medical Association. Health care policy and research Following his tenure at Texas Tech, Kupersmith was a Petersdorf scholar at the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and scholar-in-residence at the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Meidcine). Here, he led a project on how to fund and oversee Comparative Effectiveness Research which resulted in a recommendation of a public-private consortium to engage all relevant stakeholders in establishing priorities, funding research, and balancing competing interests, ideas which were later the prototype for the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on April 1, 1982. It was nominated to the register for having local significance in settlement and construction technology. The Daniel Pennie House was built by one of Pope County's most prominent early settlers using locally distinctive construction. History Daniel Pennie was born in Kinross-shire, Scotland in 1832. He immigrated to the United States in 1851, at age 19, changing the spelling of his last name from Penny to Pennie. Initially stopping in Connecticut, he settled in White County, Illinois, and became a stone mason. He then sent for his family and sweetheart, and they joined him in Illinois in 1853; he married that year. In 1858 the family moved to Richland County, Wisconsin; they then moved just west of St. Cloud, Minnesota, in what is now Waite Park. Once the concurrent Dakota War and Civil War subsided, the Pennies relocated further west, to Pope County and homesteaded land in what was to become Section 12 of Leven Township in 1865. He helped organize the boundaries within the county the following year, and assisted when the county seat was moved from Gilchrist Township to Glenwood. He named Leven Township and Lake Leven after Loch Leven in his native Scotland. Pennie became a widely respected citizen of Pope County. Politically, he was a Republican, and held a number of local and county offices. He became an elder of the United Presbyterian Church, and wrote poetry that was published in regional literary journals. Pennie had little skill at farming, leaving those tasks to his extended family so he could focus on working as a mason in the local region. At one point he desired to move the family once more, following work to Montana, but his wife insisted that they stay in Minnesota. He and his wife had seven children; he died in 1917 at age 85. The first dwellings on Pennie's farm were crude shanties on the north shore of Lake Leven, then a basic log house on the eastern shore, and finally a more elaborate log house on the site of the present house. During the 1870s, he replaced the large log house with a stone-and-concrete grout house that stands today. At one point, early in its history, the home was gutted by fire, but the walls were so sturdily built that the inside was merely rebuilt within the old walls; this was a testament to Pennie's skill at masonry. Its grout construction is rare in the state and especially unique in the Pope County area, where the vast majority of houses are of frame construction. Structure The house is a -story L-shaped structure with a gable roof. The walls are of grout construction, utilizing fieldstone and cement, and are scored to create grooves that imitate random ashlar stone. The water table and window sills are of brick. At the center of the \\"L\\" is a two-story tower with an intersecting gable roof, and gabled dormers pierce the main roof on both the east and west sides of the northern section. Windows are rectangular and segmentally arched, with two-over-two sash. The house's primary decorative feature is a wooden dentillated belt course which circumvents the building between the first and second stories. Chimneys pierce the roof ridge at a central position on the south gable and at the north end. There were one-story porches on the west facade and adjacent to the tower area; the one adjacent the tower area was enclosed in modern times with clapboard siding.

He is currently the Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health, part of the National Institutes of Health. He was previously an associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience and the Department of Biology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. He is best known for his investigation into the role of melanopsin and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) in the entrainment of circadian rhythms.  Life  Samer Hattar was born in Amman, Jordan to a Jordanian father and a Lebanese mother. Raised in a Christian family, he planned on becoming a priest. He studied at Terra Sancta High School, a Catholic high school in Amman, from 1978-1988. He earned good grades in his classes and fell in love with biology when introduced to Mendel's pea plant experiments. This passion inspired him to pursue a career in science. He attended Yarmouk University in Irbid for his undergraduate studies, where he majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry. His high marks earned him the honor of meeting Hassan Bin Talal, the prince of Jordan. After graduating from Yarmouk in 1991, he completed a master's degree in biochemistry at the American University of Beirut in Beirut. He began his graduate studies in biochemistry in 1993 at the University of Houston where he studied circadian regulation of a transcription factor in aplysia. Hattar completed his postdoctoral fellowship at the Solomon Snyder Department of Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he made discoveries on ipRGCs. In 2004, he established his laboratory in the Department of Biology at Johns Hopkins University. He is married to Rejji Kuruvilla, a neuroscientist also working at Johns Hopkins.  Scientific work  Hattar is known for his work in the area of chronobiology. He is credited with discovering that the photopigment melanopsin and associated ipRGCs play an important role in the entrainment of circadian rhythms Before Hattar's work, it was assumed that organisms entrained to daily light-dark cycles through the same mechanisms that are responsible for vision. However, case studies reported that some who were completely blind could still entrain to these cycles. This observation, coupled with the discovery of melanopsin by Ignacio Provencio, led Hattar to hypothesize that this photopigment might be responsible for photoentrainment. Melanopsin as a circadian photopigment In 2002, Hattar and his colleagues showed that melanopsin plays a key role in a variety of photic responses, including pupillary light reflex, and synchronization of the biological clock to daily light-dark cycles. He also described the role of melanopsin in ipRGCs. Using a rat melanopsin gene, a melanopsin-specific antibody, and fluorescent immunocytochemistry, the team concluded that melanopsin is expressed in some RGCs. Using a Beta-galactosidase assay, they found that these RGC axons exit the eyes together with the optic nerve and project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals. They also demonstrated that the RGCs containing melanopsin were intrinsically photosensitive. Hattar concluded that melanopsin is the photopigment in a small subset of RGCs that contributes to the intrinsic photosensitivity of these cells and is involved in their non-image forming functions, such as photic entrainment and pupillary light reflex.  Melanopsin cells relay inputs from rods and cones  Light enters the eye and hits the retinal pigmented epithelium (maroon). This excites rods (grey) and cones (blue/red). These cells synapse onto bipolar cells (pink), which stimulate ipRGCs (green) and RGCs (orange). Both RGCs and ipRGCs transmit information to the brain through the optic nerve. Furthermore, light can directly stimulate the ipRGCs through its melanopsin photopigment. The ipRGCs uniquely project to the superchiasmatic nucleus, allowing the organism to entrain to light-dark cycles. Hattar, armed with the knowledge that melanopsin was the photopigment responsible for the photosensitivity of ipRGCs, set out to study the exact role of the ipRGC in photoentrainment. In 2008, Hattar and his research team transplanted diphtheria toxin genes into the mouse melanopsin gene locus to create mutant mice that lacked ipRGCs. The research team found that while the mutants had little difficulty identifying visual targets, they could not entrain to light-dark cycles. These results led Hattar and his team to conclude that ipRGCs do not affect image-forming vision, but significantly affect non-image forming functions such as photoentrainment.  Distinct ipRGCs  Further research has shown that ipRGCs project to different brain nuclei to control both non-image forming and image forming functions. These brain regions include the SCN, where input from ipRGCs is necessary to photoentrain circadian rhythms, and the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), where input from ipRGCs control the pupillary light reflex. Hattar and colleagues conducted research that demonstrated that ipRGCs project to hypothalamic, thalamic, stratal, brainstem and limbic structures. Although ipRGCs were initially viewed as a uniform population, further research revealed that there are several subtypes with distinct morphology and physiology. Since 2011, Hattar's laboratory has contributed to these findings and has successfully distinguished subtypes of ipRGCs. = Diversity of ipRGCs = Hattar and colleges utilized Cre-based strategies for labeling ipRGCs to reveal that there are at least five ipRGC subtypes that project to a number of central targets. Five classes of ipRGCs, M1 through M5, have been characterized to date in rodents. These classes differ in morphology, dendritic localization, melanopsin content, electrophysiological profiles, and projections. = Diversity in M1 cells = Hattar and his co-workers discovered that, even among the subtypes of ipRGC, there can be designated sets that differentially control circadian versus pupillary behavior. In experiments with M1 ipRGCs, they discovered that the transcription factor Brn3b is expressed by M1 ipRGCs that target the OPN, but not by ones that target the SCN. Using this knowledge, they designed an experiment to cross Melanopsin-Cre mice with mice that conditionally expressed a toxin from the Brn3b locus. This allowed them to selectively ablate only the OPN projecting M1 ipRGCS, resulting in a loss of pupil reflexes. However, this did not impair circadian photo entrainment. This demonstrated that the M1 ipRGC consist of molecularly distinct subpopulations that innervate different brain regions and execute specific light-induced functions. This isolation of a 'labeled line' consisting of differing molecular and functional properties in a highly specific ipRGC subtype was an important first for the field. It also underscored the extent to which molecular signatures can be used to distinguish between RGC populations that would otherwise appear the same, which in turn facilitates further investigation into their specific contributions to visual processing.  Psychological impact of light exposure  Previous studies in circadian biology have established that exposure to light during abnormal hours leads to sleep deprivation and disruption of the circadian system, which affect mood and cognitive functioning. While this indirect relationship had been corroborated, not much work had been done to examine whether there was a direct relationship between irregular light exposure, aberrant mood, cognitive function, normal sleep patterns and circadian oscillations. In a study published in 2012, the Hattar Laboratory was able to show that deviant light cycles directly induce depression-like symptoms and lead to impaired learning in mice, independent of sleep and circadian oscillations. = Effect on mood = ipRGCs project to areas of the brain that are important for regulating circadian rhythmicity and sleep, most notably the SCN, subparaventricular nucleus, and the ventrolateral preoptic area. In addition, ipRGCs transmit information to many areas in the limbic system, which is strongly tied to emotion and memory. To examine the relationship between deviant light exposure and behavior, Hattar and his colleagues studied mice exposed to alternating 3.5-hour light and dark periods (T7 mice) and compared them with mice exposed to alternating 12-hour light and dark periods (T24 mice). Compared to a T24 cycle, the T7 mice got the same amount of total sleep and their circadian expression of PER2, an element of the SCN pacemaker, was not disrupted. Through the T7 cycle, the mice were exposed to light at all circadian phases. Light pulses presented at night lead to expression of the transcription factor c-Fos in the amygdala, lateral habenula, and subparaventricular nucleus further implicating light‚Äôs possible influence on mood and other cognitive functions. Mice subjected to the T7 cycle exhibited depression-like symptoms, exhibiting decreased preference for sucrose (sucrose anhedonia) and exhibiting more immobility than their T24 counterparts in the forced swim test (FST). Additionally, T7 mice maintained rhythmicity in serum corticosterone, however the levels were elevated compared to the T24 mice, a trend that is associated with depression. Chronic administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine lowered corticosterone levels in T7 mice and reduced depression-like behavior while leaving their circadian rhythms unaffected. = Effect on learning = The hippocampus is a structure in the limbic system that receives projections from ipRGCs. It is required for the consolidation of short-term memories into long-term memories as well as spatial orientation and navigation. Depression and heightened serum corticosterone levels are linked to impaired hippocampal learning. Hattar and his team analyzed the T7 mice in the Morris water maze (MWM), a spatial learning task that places a mouse in a small pool of water and tests the mouse‚Äôs ability to locate and remember the location of a rescue platform located just below the waterline. Compared to the T24 mice, the T7 mice took longer to find the platform in subsequent trials and did not exhibit a preference for the quadrant containing the platform. In addition, T7 mice exhibited impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) when subjected to theta burst stimulation (TBS). Recognition memory was also affected, with T7 mice failing to show preference for novel objects in the novel object recognition test. = Necessity of ipRGCs = Mice without (Opn4aDTA/aDTA mice) are not susceptible to the negative effects of an aberrant light cycle, indicating that light information transmitted through these cells plays an important role in regulation of mood and cognitive functions such as learning and memory.

It is used primarily for cooking. Halogen ovens are often noted for being more energy-efficient than a conventional electric oven due to their more effective heating of food and faster cooking times. Halogen cooking pot (right) from manufacturer German Pool (Hong Kong)  Design  A basic halogen oven features a heating chamber consisting of a clear glass bowl with a removable glass lid to which the heating assembly is secured. Inside the heating chamber, multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the heating assembly are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an automatic shut-off timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the heating assembly has a handle to allow users to safely lift the lid off the unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an extension ring. This raises the heating assembly to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing the volume of the oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A safety shut-off switch turns off the lamp when the lid is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.  Operation  The halogen lamp is turned on and off by a simple thermostat or electronic control and generates waves of infrared light to heat the air within the heating chamber. The fan then circulates this heated air throughout the chamber to evenly cook the contents of the bowl through convective heat transfer, or convection. It can be self-cleaned by adding some hot water and detergent to the empty bowl. The fan swirls the hot water and usually takes about ten minutes to remove any grease and some food deposits.  Efficiency  Reports often claim halogen ovens have shorter cooking times than conventional ovens, with one report stating a figure of up to 40% faster, but 20% faster on average. Another report claims a halogen oven cooks food up to 60% faster than a conventional oven. In terms of energy use, one source claims that a halogen oven uses about \\"half the electricity of a conventional oven and about the same as a microwave oven\\".

Two were built for the Imperial Japanese Navy, but both were lost in crashes, with no production following. Design and development In April 1932, the Imperial Japanese Navy issued a specification for a replacement for its current carrier-based fighter, the Nakajima A2N, asking for designs from both Mitsubishi and Nakajima. Unlike the biplane which was to be replaced, both competitors submitted monoplanes, with Nakajima offering a version of its Type 91 parasol-wing fighter, already in production for the Japanese Army. Mitsubishi assigned design of its contestant to a team led by Jiro Horikoshi, which created the first low-wing cantilever monoplane to be designed in Japan, the Mitsubishi 1MF10.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p. 170.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 407. The 1MF10 was of all-metal construction, with a monocoque duralumin fuselage, with duralumin wing structure covered in fabric, with the pilot accommodated in an open cockpit. The aircraft was powered by a Mitsubishi A4 two-row 14-cylinder radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The first prototype 1MF10, with the Navy designation Experimental 7-shi Carrier Fighter made its maiden flight in March 1933. It was destroyed in July 1933 when its tail broke up during diving tests, although the pilot escaped by parachute. The second prototype had a revised undercarriage, with the main wheels and undercarriage legs faired into streamlined spats. It was also destroyed in a crash, when it could not be recovered from a flat spin in June 1934 by pilot Motoharu Okamura. Although the design was advanced, it was rejected by the Japanese Navy, having poor handling and not meeting the performance requirements of the specification. It did form the basis of more advanced designs, however, with Horikoshi using elements of it such as the box-spar in the later successful Mitsubishi A5M fighter of similar layout.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp. 170‚Äì171.

In reflection seismology, the anelastic attenuation factor, often expressed as seismic quality factor or Q, which is inversely proportional to attenuation factor, quantifies the effects of anelastic attenuation on the seismic wavelet caused by fluid movement and grain boundary friction. When a plane wave propagates through a homogeneous viscoelastic medium, the effects of amplitude attenuation and velocity dispersion may be combined conveniently into the single dimensionless parameter, Q. As a seismic wave propagates through a medium, the elastic energy associated with the wave is gradually absorbed by the medium, eventually ending up as heat energy. This is known as absorption (or anelastic attenuation) and will eventually cause the total disappearance of the seismic wave.Toksoz, W.M., & Johnston, D.H. 1981. Seismic Wave Attenuation. SEG. The frequency-dependent attenuation of seismic waves leads to decreased resolution of seismic images with depth. Transmission losses may also occur due to friction or fluid movement, and for a given physical mechanism, they can be conveniently described with an empirical formulation where elastic moduli and propagation velocity are complex functions of frequency. Bj√∏rn Ursin and Tommy Toverud Ursin B. and Toverud T. 2002 Comparison of seismic dispersion and attenuation models. Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica 46, 293‚Äì320. published an article where they compared different Q models. Basics In order to compare the different models they considered plane-wave propagation in a homogeneous viscoelastic medium. They used the Kolsky‚ÄìFutterman model as a reference and studied several other models. These other models were compared with the behavior of the Kolsky‚ÄìFutterman model. The Kolsky‚ÄìFutterman model was first described in the article ‚ÄòDispersive body waves‚Äô by Futterman (1962).Futterman (1962) ‚ÄòDispersive body waves‚Äô. Journal of Geophysical Research 67. pp. 5279‚Äì91 'Seismic inverse Q-filtering' by Yanghua Wang (2008) contains an outline discussing the theory of Futterman, beginning with the wave equation:Wang 2008, p. 60 :\\\\frac { dU(r,w)}{ dr} - ikU(r,w)=0 \\\\quad (1.1) where U(r,w) is the plane wave of radial frequency w at travel distance r, k is the wavenumber and i is the imaginary unit. Reflection seismograms record the reflection wave along the propagation path r from the source to reflector and back to the surface. Equation (1.1) has an analytical solution given by: :U(r+\\\\bigtriangleup r,w) =U(r,w)\\\\exp (ik\\\\bigtriangleup r) \\\\quad (1.2) where k is the wave number. When the wave propagates in inhomogeneous seismic media the propagation constant k must be a complex value that includes not only an imaginary part, the frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient, but also a real part, the dispersive wave number. We can call this K(w) a propagation constant in line with Futterman.Futterman (1962) p.5280 :K(iw) =k(w)+ i a(w) \\\\quad (1.3) k(w) can be linked to the phase velocity of the wave with the formula: : c(w)=\\\\frac {w}{k(w)} \\\\quad (1.4) Kolsky's attenuation-dispersion model To obtain a solution that can be applied to seismic k(w) must be connected to a function that represents the way in which U(r,w) propagates in the seismic media. This function can be regarded as a Q-model. In his outline Wang calls the Kolsky‚ÄìFutterman model the Kolsky model. The model assumes the attenuation Œ±(w) to be strictly linear with frequency over the range of measurement:Wang 2008, p. 18, sec. 2.1: Kolsky's attenuation-dispersion model :\\\\alpha=\\\\frac {w}{(2 c_r Q_r)} \\\\quad (1.5) And defines the phase velocity as: :\\\\frac {1}{c(w)} =\\\\frac {1}{c_r} (1-\\\\frac {1}{\\\\pi Q_r} \\\\ln \\\\frac{w}{w_r}) \\\\quad (1.6) where cr and Qr are the phase velocity and the Q value at a reference frequency wr. For a large value of Qr >> 1 the solution (1.6) can be approximated to :\\\\frac {1}{c(w)} =\\\\frac {1}{c_r} \\\\frac{w}{w_r}^{-\\\\gamma} \\\\quad (1.7) where : \\\\gamma =(\\\\pi Q_r)^{-1} Kolsky‚Äôs model was derived from and fit well with experimental observations. The theory for materials satisfying the linear attenuation assumption requires that the reference frequency wr is a finite (arbitrarily small but nonzero) cut-off on the absorption. According to Kolsky, we are free to choose wr following the phenomenological criterion that it be small compared with the lowest measured frequency w in the frequency band.Wang 2008, p.19 More information regarding this concept can be found in Futterman (1962)Futterman (1962) ‚ÄòDispersive body waves‚Äô. Journal of Geophysical Research 67. pp. 5279‚Äì91 Computations For each of the Q models Ursin B. and Toverud T. presented in their article they computed the attenuation (1.5) and phase velocity (1.6) in the frequency band 0‚Äì300 Hz.

The first group consists of models 1-5 below, the other group including models 6-8.

His family later moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he finished high school. Following high school, Wheeler served in the U.S. Army for two years, later returning to the Army National Guard and immediately volunteering for active duty service in 2005 and 2006. As a student, Wheeler played college football at Iowa Central Community College (Fort Dodge, Iowa) and Emporia State University (Emporia, KS). After returning from Army duty, Wheeler was a high school head football coach for one year, 2007. While attending Emporia State University, Wheeler started a competing newspaper (Emporia Press Review) to the campus newspaper at Emporia State which received attention citywide and in a short time became a competitor to the city newspaper the Emporia Gazette. Upon leaving Emporia State, Wheeler hosted a nationwide radio show, Reporter‚Äôs Journal. He then helped to create and develop the Washington, DC-based investigative television series, American Investigator Television Newsmagazine. Wheeler became a correspondent with the show and ultimately chief correspondent for the series that aired on NET (America‚Äôs Voice) and later syndicated.  Investigations and Political Advocacy  Wheeler has worked undercover to reveal the internal operations of Hamas within the United States, leading to several suspects named in the reports to be arrested. Wheeler also exposed a weapons-of-mass-destruction pipeline run out of the Middle East, posing as an undercover arms dealer during his investigation in 1998 and 1999. Wearing video and audio equipment, Wheeler recorded the suspects and tracked the arms procurement network back to Libya and reported on Libya‚Äôs WMD program before it was known to US intelligence agencies. During the Clinton Administration, Wheeler traveled to Asia and investigated the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy. Many of his reports during this period were used in criminal prosecutions, congressional investigations and hearings, and were recognized by members of Congress as the catalysts for their investigations. Wheeler produced the documentary Trading with the Enemy: How the Clinton Administration Armed China that claimed that President Clinton had decontrolled dangerous military technology to The People‚Äôs Republic of China while receiving illegal donations from operatives from PRC. In 2003, Wheeler‚Äôs reportage led to the exposure of a foreign agent from China operating inside the U.S. posing as a college student. In 2009, Wheeler co- authored, along with Dr. Peter Leitner, the book Shadow Government: What Obama Doesn‚Äôt Want You To Know About His Czars'. The book's content was used in long-form campaign advertisements run by the National Republican Trust PAC right before the 2010 election. In 2012 Wheeler wrote the book, Promoting Decline: Obama vs. America. Wheeler has been a frequent guest on Fox News Channel and Fox Business News.

It was originally described under the name Pluteus michiganensis but molecular studies have placed it in the Volvopluteus, a genus described in 2011. The cap of this mushroom is about in diameter, gray, and has a cracked margin that is sticky when fresh. The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink. The stipe is white and has a volva at the base. Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species. V. michiganensis is a saprotrophic fungus that was originally described as growing on sawdust. It has only been reported from Michigan (USA) and the Dominican Republic. Taxonomy This species was originally described by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith in 1934 as Pluteus michiganensis, based on collections made in Ann Arbor in October 1932. In the original description there is no mention of a volva at the base of the stipe, one of the morphological characters separating Pluteus from Volvopluteus. Smith did mention that \\"the large spores are unusual for the genus Pluteus\\". The species then disappeared from the mycological literature of the 20th century and Smith did not include his own species when he revised the type collections of North American Pluteus. Morphological revision of the type and DNA sequence data (based on Internal transcribed spacer sequences) obtained from the collection confirmed that this taxon belongs in the genus Volvopluteus, and that it is a separate species from all the other members of that genus. The epithet michiganensis refers to the state of Michigan, where the fungus was originally described. The original holotype specimens of this species are preserved at the University of Michigan Herbarium. Description Macroscopic characters The cap of Volvopluteus michiganensis is between in diameter, more or less ovate or conical when young, then expands to convex or flat. It can have low, broad umbo at center in old specimens; the surface is markedly viscid in fresh basidiocarps and covered with radially arranged fibrills; the cap is ash gray, similar to the color of Tricholoma terreum. The gills are crowded, free from the stipe, ventricose, up to broad; white when young turning pink with age. The stipe is long and wide, club-shaped with a bulbous base; the surface is white, smooth or tomentose. The volva is sac-like, white and has a smooth surface. The context is white in the stipe and cap and it does not change when bruised or exposed to air. The smell was recorded as \\"earthy, fragrant\\"; the taste was not recorded. The spore print color was not recorded, but it is assumed to be pinkish-brown. Microscopic characters The basidiospores are 10.5‚Äì13.5 by 6.5‚Äì8 ¬µm with an ellipsoid shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35‚Äì55 by 10‚Äì15 ¬µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are 70‚Äì110 by 25‚Äì45 ¬µm, fusiform (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60‚Äì75 by 15‚Äì27 ¬µm, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100‚Äì360 by 10‚Äì20 ¬µm and mostly cylindrical. File:Michiganensis pleurocystidia.jpgPleurocystidia File:Michiganensis cheilocystidia.jpgCheilocystidia Ecology and distribution Volvopluteus michiganensis is a saprotrophic mushroom. The type collection was collected on sawdust. The collections from the Dominican Republic were collected on piles of vegetable matter. This species is only known from the type locality (Ann Arbor) and a second locality in the Dominican Republic. Morphologically, the Dominican collection matches the type collection well, but no molecular comparison has been performed. Similar species Molecular analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus but identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. Volvopluteus michiganensis is distinguished from other species of Volvopluteus by its relatively shorter spores, measuring on average less than 12.5 ¬µm long.

Otherwise it checks whether Pj, and Pk are in different controllers, are locally dependent and Pj is waiting for the resource that is locked by Pk. Once all the conditions are satisfied it sends the probe.  Controller receiving a probe  On the receiving side, the controller checks whether Pk is performing a task. If so, it neglects the probe. Otherwise, it checks the responses given Pk to Pj and dependentk(i) is false. Once it is verified, it assigns true to dependentk(i). Then it checks whether k is equal to i. If both are equal, a deadlock occurs, otherwise it sends the probe to next dependent process.  Algorithm  In pseudocode, the algorithm works as follows:  Controller sending a probe  if Pj is locally dependent on itself then declare deadlock else for all Pj,Pk such that (i) Pi is locally dependent on Pj, (ii) Pj is waiting for 'Pk and (iii) Pj, Pk are on different controllers. send probe(i, j, k). to home site of Pk  Controller receiving a probe  if (i)Pk is idle / blocked (ii) dependentk(i) = false, and (iii) Pk has not replied to all requests of to Pj then begin \\"dependents\\"\\"k\\"(i) = true; if k  i then declare that Pi is deadlocked else for all Pa,Pb such that (i) Pk is locally dependent on Pa, (ii) Pa is waiting for 'Pb and (iii) Pa, Pb are on different controllers. send probe(i, a, b). to home site of Pb end  Example  occurrence of deadlock in distributed system P1 initiates deadlock detection. C1 sends the probe saying P2 depends on P3. Once the message is received by C2, it checks whether P3 is idle. P3 is idle because it is locally dependent on P4 and updates dependent3(2) to True. As above, C2 sends probe to C3 and C3 sends probe to C1. At C1, P1 is idle so it update dependent1(1) to True. Therefore, deadlock can be declared.  Complexity  Consider that there are \\"m\\" controllers and \\"p\\" process to perform, to declare whether a deadlock has occurred or not, the worst case for controllers and processes must be visited. Therefore, the solution is O(m+p). The time complexity is O(n).

Alexey Nikolayevich Olenin (Aleksey Nikolaevich Olenin, ; in Moscow - in Saint Petersburg) was a Russian archaeologist, most notable for being a director of the Imperial Public Library between 1811 and 1843 and the sixth president of the Imperial Academy of Arts between 1817 and 1843. Early life Olenin was born into a noble family in Moscow. He received his initial education at home. Then in 1774, as was customary at the time among Russian aristocracy, he was enrolled in the Corps of Pages. In 1780 he was sent to study history and art history in Dresden. Career In 1785 Olenin returned to Russia to start a military career. In parallel he was writing a dictionary of military quotations and in 1786 he was elected to the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, even though the dictionary had not yet been published. In December 1786 Olenin quit military service, but in 1789 he rejoined the army. He was sent to Pskov and subsequently, in 1789‚Äî1790, participated in the Russo-Swedish war. In 1795 he was promoted to the rank of colonel and retired from military service for good. After 1795 Olenin was employed on a variety of civil positions, including director of the Saint Petersburg Mint (1799). In 1811 he was appointed director of the Imperial Public Library. From 1794 he took a keen interest in art, in particular, produced a number of graphic works, and formed a large collection of antiquities, which he later (in 1829) donated to the Academy of Arts. He went on to illustrate a number of books, including the selected works of Gavrila Derzhavin and a book of fables by Ivan Khemnitser. In 1804 he was elected a member of the Academy of Arts. In 1806 Olenin published his first scholarly paper, A letter to Prince Musin-Pushkin on the stone of Tmutarakan found at the island of Taman in 1792, in which he deciphered the inscription on the stone. Because of this paper, Olenin is regarded as a founder of Russian palaeography. He is also notable for being the host of one of the most fashionable salons in Saint Petersburg, which attracted many authors, artists, musicians, and actors. Alexander Pushkin, considered to be the most famous Russian poet, was romantically involved with Anna Olenina, Alexey Olenin's youngest daughter. He wrote a number of poems to her, and even proposed to her in 1828, but was rejected outright. Anna Olenina did not marry until 1840. Death Alexey Olenin died in Saint Petersburg in 1843, still in office, and was buried in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

The Desert Line starts at the border crossing at Division, near Campo at Milepost 59.94 (inside Tunnel #4) in eastern San Diego County, California where it connects with the Baja California Railroad in Mexico, and stretches 70.1 miles through the Jacumba Mountains to El Centro, California, where it connects to Union Pacific Railroad at Milepost 129.61. The significance of the Desert Line is that it provides an alternative rail route to and from the east for servicing the distribution, transportation, and supply chain needs of the Cali-Baja region. History In 2012, following the embargo of the Carrizo Gorge Railway (CZRY) in October 2008 and the loss of operating rights in the Mexican Tecate-Tijuana segment, Pacific Imperial Railroad, Inc. replaced the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad as the rail operator between Plaster City and the border near Campo. The last freight movements through the area were sand from Mexico, for use in making ready-mixed concrete for the construction markets in San Diego County, CA. Pacific Imperial Railroad, Inc. (PIR), was incorporated in Delaware on October 27, 2011 and qualified to do business in California on April 23, 2012, having its stated objectives being to lease, rehabilitate, reopen and resume service, manage, operate, and maintain the entire Desert Line from \\"Mileposts 59.94\\" at or near the U.S. Border in \\"Division\\" to \\"Milepost 130.0\\" at Plaster City, west of El Centro. On December 20, 2012, PIR executed a 99-year lease with San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway (SD&AE;) and San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), owners of the Desert Line right of way. The Desert Line extends from east San Diego County (border with Baja California) to western Imperial County. According to an article in the San Diego Union-Tribune, in early 2014, a management team hired by the company left, alleging that investor money was fraudulently diverted to company principals. Company officials denied that was the case, and MTS said it found no evidence of any fraud. On or around October 17, 2014, Mexico's Baja California Railroad (BJRR) ended negotiations with PIR with concerns over the U.S. company's rights to haul freight through Mexico across the former Tijuana and Tecate Railroad. An article from the San Diego Reader implied that goods from San Diego may have to be trucked through Mexico and then loaded onto trains in the United States before continuing to El Centro to interchange with the Union Pacific Railroad. However, there was an apparent turning point in the negotiations between BJRR and PIR sometime during the first half of 2015. On June 22, 2015 at the MTS headquarters in Downtown, San Diego, Baja California Railroad and Pacific Imperial Railroad reached a significant step by executing a memorandum of understanding expressly acknowledging the parties' desire and intent to work together to develop a binational railroad and outlining the expectations and issues that need to be resolved. The MOU states that the parties will use their best efforts to reach a \\"definitive agreement\\" on these outstanding issues within six months. Additionally, acknowledging that the delays in reaching an agreement with BJRR have also delayed the construction work necessary to bring the Desert Line back to an operational condition making it highly unlikely that PIR would be able to run a test train by the December 2015 lease deadline, PIR's management proposed that MTS agree to modify certain performance milestones so as to not be in violation of the lease. Subsequently, on July 17, 2015 PIR announced on the company's website that the new milestones were approved by the MTS Board of Directors by a 17-0 vote. New owners took majority control of PIR in 2015. In June 2016, PIR and BJRR reached an agreement to pay the rehabilitation and operations of the Desert Line. BJRR subleased the Desert Line from Campo to Coyote Well; PIR will operate between Coyote Wells and Plaster City. Work by BJRR on restoring the Desert Line was scheduled to begin in the summer of 2016. In October 2015 Arturo Alemany Salazar was confirmed as a CEO and president of PIR.Pacific Imperial Railroad Announces Majority Ownership Transfer and the Appointment of CEO and President Arturo Alemany In October 2016, PIR announced it filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in order to facilitate the further development of its primary asset. According to Arturo Alemany, the recently appointed Chief Executive Officer of PIR, \\"the Chapter 11 petition will enable PIR to complete its goal by securing a strategic partner with the necessary capital and expertise to develop the remainder of PIR's railway assets in a manner that will pay PIR's creditors and further the interests of the public at large.\\" Various claims arising from before Mr. Alemany's involvement with PIR had a chilling effect on PIR's ability to raise capital. The Chapter 11 proceeding will enable PIR to maximize the value of its assets, while providing an effective forum for resolving any disputes regarding the claims. On March 10, 2017, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge approved the sale of PIR's Desert Line track leases and development rights to a Nevada corporation affiliated with Baja California Railroad. The bankruptcy case is still open, pending a final accounting of payments to creditors and two investor lawsuits. Operations In June 2013 PIR entered into an agreement with J.L. Patterson & Associates, Inc. to commence inspections of the bridges, tunnels, track, and rail. A \\"summary level\\" report of the general condition of the bridges was completed in October 2013. So far, J.L. Patterson has completed initial repairs by clearing sand from the line that blew into the line's right-of-way with a ballast regulator and ran a high-tech Holland Track Geometry Hi-Rail truck on the Desert Line to identify defects on the entire Desert line. As of July 1, 2015 PIR has made 5 payments of $500,000 totaling $2.5 million to MTS, owners of SD&AE;'s Desert Line right of way as part of the lease. Thursday, June 9, 2016 - Binational Agreement Reached to Reconstruct the Desert Line Railroad \\"We have worked very hard with our partners in Mexico to realize this dream,\\" said Arturo Alemany, Executive Board Member for Pacific Imperial Railroad. \\"This is a joint effort that will create a new cost-effective option for international businesses to ship products, such as automobiles, from Mexico to the eastern United States.\\" Projects PIR officials target the maquiladora market by interchanging with the Baja California Railroad where it meets the west end of the Desert Line, at the Mexico-US border at Division/Lindero (between Tecate and Campo), and with Union Pacific Railroad in Plaster City, CA. The PIR has also expressed intent to finance the proposed \\"El Lindero\\" customs, intermodal interchange, and industrial park project, which would be located one kilometer south of the border at Division/Lindero. Improvements to the \\"Desert Line\\" started in August 2013. In August 2015, 49 empty boxcars were removed from the dormant line by GATX in preparation for reconstruction efforts.

She was the only legitimate child of Peter II, Count of Savoy, but did not inherit the county, which passed instead to her uncle. Beatrice was also Dauphine of Viennois and Viscountess of B√©arn by her two marriages. First marriage In 1253 Beatrice was married to Guigues VII of Viennois, they had been betrothed to each other since 1241, the marriage being the work of Beatrice's maternal grandfather Aymon II, Seigneur de Faucigny. The subject of Beatrice's inheritance was soon raised. Her mother Agnes, had originally intended to give a third of the inheritance to her daughter and two thirds to her husband Peter.State Archives, volume 104, page 11, fascicule 10, and Wurstenberger (1858), Vol. IV, 586, p. 299. However, she changed her will and named Beatrice as the sole heir of her lands in Faucigny along with Beatrice's husband Guigues.State Archives, volume 104, page 15, fascicules 12.1 and 2, and Wurstenberger (1858), Vol. IV, 657, p. 336. Beatrice's parents died in 1268. Beatrice and her husband, however, only inherited some of the lands that had belonged to her mother. Beatrice was forced to give up Thoire-Villars to her aunt, also named Beatrice. The claim of Beatrice to all of her mother's inheritance was strong considering the power of Guigues. However, due to exclusion of women from succession to Savoy, the county passed to her uncle, Philip I. Philip supported Beatrice's aunt in the Faucigny inheritance dispute, leading to a war. Beatrice was captured and imprisoned. She was forced to cede a portion of her inheritance to her aunt and pay homage to Savoy throughout the 1290s. In 1269, Guigues died and due to the minority of their son John, Beatrice was appointed his regent. Her son was married to Bonne, daughter of Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, who was a cousin of Beatrice. However, her son died after a fall from a horse aged around eighteen. He was eventually succeeded by Beatrice's older daughter Anne and her husband Humbert, with future dauphins descending from their marriage. Following the death of her son, Beatrice left for Taninges with his remains, laying them to rest there and praying for his soul in the monastery she founded, M√©lan. Second marriage and widowhood Beatrice was married for a second time on April 2, 1273 to Gaston VII, Viscount of B√©arn. Her second marriage is confirmed by the agreement dated 15 December 1284 under which Gaston makes an agreement with Anne and Humbert over his claim on the County of Vienne.State Archives, volume 102, page 15, fascicule 1. Beatrice arranged a marriage for stepdaughter Constance of B√©arn to Aymon II of Geneva, a relative through her grandmother. Gaston had dealt with domestic problems amongst his daughters from his first marriage and which would succeed him upon death, his sons-in- law Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix and Gerald VI, Count of Armagnac had battled for power. The marriage between Beatrice and Gaston did not produce any children. After seventeen years of marriage, Gaston died and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Roger-Bernard. Beatrice did not remarry after the death of her second husband but did have more political involvement with her family back in Savoy. In 1294, she transferred her lands between Seyssel and Freiburg to her cousin Count Amadeus V. In 1296, she gave up her title as Dame of Faucigny to her son-in-law Humbert, for the benefit of one of his sons, reserving the usufruct for herself.Kerrebrouck (2000), pp. 624-5. Beatrice continued to be a powerful force in Savoy, causing torment for her cousin Amadeus especially, when she attempted to claim Savoy for her grandson Hugh. However, the claim proved unsuccessful and Amadeus remained Count for the rest of his lifetime. Beatrice died on 21 April 1310 and was buried at her monastery in Melun beside her son. Her various alliances with relatives and clerics in Geneva and the sharing out of her inheritance during and after her life, led to conflicts amongst her descendants for generations.Marie Jos√© (1956), p. 46.

Introduction Orchid fleck virus, despite its presence worldwide, only affects a small spectrum of human life. Orchids are not used for food but rather serve mainly as ornamental decoration. Therefore, only about 2 to 3 scientific reports are written about OFV each year. The whole genome of OFV has been sequenced and its six main protein products have been sequenced as well.Kondo H, Maeda T, Shirako Y, Tamada T 2006. Orchid fleck virus is a rhabdovirus with an unusual bipartite genome. J Gen Virol 87:2413‚Äì2421. Much is still not known about OFV including how exactly and why vector mites travel from orchid to orchid, and more host species of flowers are being discovered annually. The more information researchers discover, the more they realize there is still much left to learn. Many orchid enthusiasts are participating in \\"citizen science\\" by posting their OFV-related findings on international horticulture blogs and forums. Virion morphology OFV was first described as bacilliform Doi Y, Arai K, Yora K 1969. Distribution of bacilliform virus particles in Masaki mosaic disease and Cymbidium ring spot disease. Ann Phytopathol Soc Jpn 35:388. but depending on the method of preparation, OFV can appear bullet- shaped or bacilliform. On average, OFV is 40 nm in diameter and between 100 and 150 nm long. Each viral particles is organized into a tight 25 turn helix, with a pitch of about 4.5 nm.Kondo H, Maeda T, Tamada T 2009. Identification and characterization of structural proteins of orchid fleck virus. Arch Virol 154:37‚Äì45. Genomics OFV contains two ssRNA molecules, RNA1 and RNA2, of 6413 and 6001 base pairs, respectively. GenBank contains the whole sequenced genome of OFV. RNA1 (GenBank AB244417) codes for five proteins whereas RNA2 (GenBank AB244418) only codes for one. Both strands possess open reading frames (ORF), which are read in the negative sense. RNA1 *ORF1: Nucleocapsid (N) protein *ORF2: Phosphoprotein (P) *ORF3: Proteins involved in viral cell- to-cell movement *ORF4: Matrix (M) protein *ORF5: Glycoprotein (G) RNA2 *ORF6: Polymerase (L) protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) Pathophysiology Chlorotic and necrotic flecks, spots, and/or ringspots, as well as yellow flecks or spots are all symptoms of an OFV infection. Studies have also shown that OFV may prevent the propagation of other viruses in an already OFV- infected plant.Peng DW, Zheng GH, Zheng ZZ, Tong QX, Ming YL 2013 Orchid fleck virus: an unclassified bipartite, negative-sense RNA plant virus. Archives of Virology.158(2):313-323. Vector The false spider mite, B. californicus serves as the major vector for OFV.Maeda T, Kondo H, Mitsuhata K, Tamada T 1998. Evidence that orchid fleck virus is efficiently transmitted in a persistent manner by the mite Brevipalpus californicus. In: Proceedings of the 7th Int Cong Plant Pathol, pp 13‚Äì18. Brevipalpus mites go through four distinct, active life stages, each separated by nonmotile chrysalis stages.Childers CC, Rodrigues JCV 2011. An overview of Brevipalpus mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) and the plant viruses they transmit Zoosymposia 6:168‚Äì180. The protonymph, deutonymph, and adult stages can infect their host plants with OFV, whereas the larval stage is not infectious. Even after three weeks of incubation of an OFV-positive mite on an OFV-resistant plant, B. californicus proved to still be infectious, showing that OFV is persistent.Kondo H, Maeda T. & Tamada T 2003. Orchid fleck virus:Brevipalpus californicus mite transmission, biological properties and genome structure. Exp Appl Acarol 30, 215‚Äì223. Hosts OFV is able to naturally infect around 50 different species in 31 genera, all belonging to the family Orchidaceae. 25 other species from 11 non-orchid families have been infected through sap transmission or artificial viral inoculation. Life cycle Studies have not shown whether or not OFV actually replicates within B. californicus but electron microscopy has revealed an intricate viral life cycle within the host cells. Viral ssRNA is replicated and transcribed into mRNA in the host cell‚Äôs nucleus. Viral mRNA is then exported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it is translated into viral protein by the host‚Äôs ribosomes. The viral proteins then reenter the nucleus where they aggregate into a viroplasm. There, the various viral structural proteins assemble with both strands of ssRNA to form complete OFV particles. These particles often cluster in between the inner and outer nuclear membranes, causing visible projections which often evaginate into cytoplasmic vesicles. Electron microscopy has revealed clusters of viral particles positioned perpendicular to the inner nuclear membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as the aforementioned cytoplasmic vesicles, forming distinctive ‚Äúspoked wheel‚Äù structures. Effects on fitness Infected orchids don't bloom as well as healthy ones, affecting efficacy of pollination and fertilization. Also, the orchids that do bloom look lifeless making them less attractive on the cut flower market. Epidemiology Cases of orchid fleck virus or OF-like viruses have been reported in Australia, Brazil, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Korea, South Africa, and the United States, i.e. every continent except for Antarctica. Due to the fact that viruses depend on their host cell for replication, OFV cannot be cultured independently. However, two non-orchid indicator hosts (plants used in research that show characteristic symptoms of specific viral infections) C. quinoa and T. expansa are commonly used for viral inoculation and isolation. There are no known pathogens of OFV itself but its vector, B. californicus has a symbiotic relationship with bacteria of the genus Cardinium. The symbiont is the cause of the mites' thelytokous method of reproduction (where females are produced from unfertilized eggs) and the explanation for the absence of male B. californicus mites.Groot TVM & Breeuwer JAJ 2006. Cardinium symbionts induce haploid thelytoky in most clones of three closely related Brevipalpusspecies. Experimental and Applied Acarology, 39, 257‚Äì271. Diagnosis Thin tissue samples from plants with visible symptoms of OFV can undergo: *Electron microscopy to visualize virions and complete viral particles *Serological analysis to identify and isolate specific viral proteins *Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction to identify viral RNA Prevention Methods for preventing the spread of OFV among separate plants:Liu L, Lin ZK, Guo Y 2010. Progress on molecule biology of phalaenopsis virus and the corresponding prevention measures. Anhui Agric Sci Bull 16(21‚Äì23):126. *Ensure seedlings are virus-free *Improve quarantine measures *Eliminate sources of infection (mites or other infected plants) *Ensure proper environment for cultivation *Work towards developing OFV-resistant plants through genetic engineering Treatment Once a plant is infected with OFV, it is unclear whether pruning visibly infected tissue will cure the plant of the virus. It is also unclear whether infected plants produce seeds containing viral particles. History The earliest recorded work concerning Orchid Fleck Virus was published in Japan in 1969. OFV was reported as concentrations of short, rod-like particles in chlorotic lesions on the leaves of boat orchids of the genus Cymbidium. Human relevance Orchids and other tropical flowers are extremely important to the agricultural economy of many Southeast Asian countries. The Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' orchid hybrid is Singapore's national flower. According to the Orchid Society, the world market for orchids is worth more than $1 billion with Japan and the United States leading the way in 2010. In the US in 2005 produced around $144 million worth of orchids.U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2006a. Floriculture crops 2005 summary. Agricultural Statistics Board, Washington D.C.

Joseph Albert \\"Jean\\" Lussier (1891‚Äì1971) was a Canadian-American daredevil, best known for going over the Horseshoe Falls on July 4, 1928.  Early life  Joseph Albert Lussier, better known as Jean, was born in 1891 in either Concord, New Hampshire or Quebec, Canada.  Stunt  Unlike the daredevils who had gone over the Falls previously in wooden barrels, Lussier designed and built a 6 ft rubber ball lined with oxygen tubes. The recent death of daredevil Charles Stephens (who went over the falls in a barrel) did not deter Lussier, but instead motivated him even more to try his own unique version of the stunt. On July 4, 1928, Lussier took the plunge over the falls. Despite the damage sustained by the ball, Lussier emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor bruising from the impact. Lussier successfully became the fourth daredevil to go over Niagara Falls, and the third to survive.  Later life  Capitalizing on his newfound fame and notoriety, Lussier moved to Niagara Falls and began selling pieces of the ball to tourists. Once he ran out, he later used pieces of tires. In 1952, when Lussier was 61 years old, he dreamed of becoming the only person to go over both of the major Niagara Falls. He started making plans to make his second daredevil stunt and go over the American Falls in a larger and more complex rubber ball. Unfortunately, his dreams never materialized, and he retired in 1958 at the age of 67. Lussier died of natural causes in 1971 at the age of 80.

Based on a screenplay by Richard Curtis, it was produced by Working Title Television, in association with the BBC and NBCUniversal. The film had its UK premiere on 1 March 2013 on the BBC and premiered in the US on HBO on 20 April 2013. The film is based on a true story. The film centers around two mothers, one British, one American, who share only one thing in common: the loss of their sons to malaria. After the deaths of their sons, the mothers decide to travel to Africa to help with malaria prevention. The film was nominated for the Humanitas Prize.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2284766/ Plot The film tells the story of two very different women, Mary (Hilary Swank) and Martha (Brenda Blethyn), who both lose their sons to malaria. Mary is an overly protective American mother. After her young son and only child, George (Lux Haney-Jardine), is bullied by classmates, she decides to pull him out of school and take him on an extended trip to Africa because she feels she can give him a better education. While there, he is bitten by a mosquito, contracts malaria, and dies. In the midst of grieving, Mary decides to return to Africa after George's funeral where she meets Martha, a British woman whose grown son, Ben (Sam Claflin), has also just died of the same disease while working at an orphanage in Mozambique. He too was an only child. The two women turn their grief into action, hoping to thwart the disease, which the World Health Organization estimates killed 660,000 people in 2010, most of them African children. The movie builds to a scene in which the women testify before a Congressional subcommittee. In the process, Mary and Martha come to realise that the losses experienced by two comfortable white Western households are atypical, and that the real impact of malaria is on parts of the world that few people in their circles know or care about.

Brian Lowry from Variety felt that \\"Mary and Martha harks back to when the service was content to tell great little stories ‚Äì often with an agenda ‚Äì that might not have been commercial enough to find a home elsewhere [...] Admittedly, Curtis has a rather facile view of how good can be accomplished, but in a cynical age, there's something refreshing about old-fashioned idealism, even if the movie hinges on well-intentioned Westerners bringing relief to the Third World. Part of that has to do with the intensely personal approach to the story, and the palpable anguish Swank and Blethyn convey.\\" Neil Genzlinger, writer for The New York Times, wrote that \\"this movie grabs for every heartstring in sight\\" and added, \\"also detracting from the story is that the movie has too much Mary and not enough Martha. So much effort goes into setting up Ms. Swank's somewhat annoying character for a fall that Ms. Blethyn's more interesting character is given short shrift. But the scenes in which the two actresses are together have some real power.\\" Critical with the film, The A.V. Clubs Simon Abrams wrote that \\"at first, the off-the-cuff insensitivity that Mary and Marthas characters persistently exhibit seems benign enough. Mary and Martha is, after all, a made-for-TV melodrama about two mothers that bond after their respective sons die from malaria, and grief does sometimes manifest itself in strange ways. Screenwriter Richard Curtis and director Phillip Noyce do their best to, in the words of Hilary Swank's Mary, \\"tell you how it feels to have a personal involvement with malaria.\\" But while Curtis makes a point of making characters show their grief by gingerly stepping on each other's toes, Mary and Martha is more of a product of unwitting creative insensitivity than an apt reflection of it.\\" References External links  Category:2013 television films Category:HBO Films films Category:American films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:British television films Category:Films directed by Phillip Noyce ","title":"Mary and Martha (film)"},{"id":"39093609","title":"Tales of a GrassWidow"},{"id":"39093614","text":"The 1946 Youngstown Penguins football team represented Youngstown University‚Äînow known as Youngstown State University The Penguins were led by eighth year head coach Dike Beede and played their home games at Rayen Stadium.

It is believed that the ground was redeveloped around 1965. Former use Before the ground was redeveloped it was a greyhound racing track known as the Arklow Greyhound Track. The track raced under Irish Coursing Club rules and opened on 30 July 1949 but the Arklow Greyhound Racing Company was fined in 1949 for failing to stamp admission tickets and failure to produce a register. In 1951 landlord William Smyth sued the company for ¬£375 unpaid rent & ¬£1,300 under a covenant of the lease. The company counter claimed for ¬£4,200 stating that payments had been made to Mr Smyth but they lost the case. The 13 acre, 2 rood, 16 perches site complete with grandstand was then put up for auction in 1953 and again in December 1954. With no buyer due to the government refusing licensing the site went to auction again on 31 May 1956. Another application for re-opening in 1958 was refused because the nearby Enniscorthy Greyhound Stadium track objected. The Royal Bank Ltd acquired the site and auctioned it off for a last time on 25 March 1958 as freehold land.

He first appeared during the episode broadcast on 13 November 2012. His storylines in the programme have included stalking Jas Khella (Vineeta Rishi), his friendship with colleague Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan) and dealing with his mother's dementia. Development Characterisation Al was introduced into the series as a \\"cynical\\" general practitioner. Writers partnered him with Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan), who is \\"uptight\\" and initially struggles to get along with Al. He is immediately given a dramatic story in which a patient is stabbed and Jimmi leaves Al to tend to his injuries. A writer from BBC Online described Al as not being a typical GP because he is \\"lazy, sarcastic and a bit of a glutton.\\" Al is happy to accept accusations of hypocrisy and dislikes \\"time wasters and anything that‚Äôs too saccharine\\". Writers also gave the character a side hobby as an inventor, with Al having become interested in making gadgets as a child. In 2013, Midlane opined that the character was conflicted over science and religion in his mind. He added that finding love is the \\"greatest mystery of all for Al.\\" Stalker mystery When writers created Al they devised a stalker mystery story that featured him and fellow doctor Jas Khella (Vineeta Rishi). The latter becomes to victim of a stalking campaign which leads her colleagues to believe that Al is the culprit. The story was devised by storyliner Loretta Preece and it was inspired after she heard a chance conversation. Preece thought about how people are affected by intrusion and thought it was be an interesting topic to explore on the show. Midlane was informed about the story when he auditioned for the role. When Al and Jas shared their first scenes, he was portrayed as having an instant attraction to her. Midlane claimed that this was a deliberate \\"seed\\" planted by writers to make him a suspect. The story received a slow buildup on-screen and Midlane found it \\"really satisfying\\" and \\"rewarding to take Al to the brink\\". He told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that he did not think Al was a stalker but did think he harassed Jas. In one incident Al is found outside Jas' home, a plot device which makes him a strong suspect. Midlane explained that Jas makes Al feel good and a number of personal grievances make him vulnerable. Al was \\"broke\\" and had no one to support him and \\"he started this peculiar behaviour [...] Jas became a comfort to him, a hope of better things. In looking after her, he could heal himself. Then circumstance made things really, really bad.\\" Writers played Al becoming disliked at work, with Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh) and Kevin Tyler (Simon Rivers) being the first colleagues to turn against him. Midlane said that \\"Al doesn't feel loved at work, so if he feels humiliated and disappointed by the way they react to him, he isn't surprised by it.\\" Jas' stalker is later revealed to be a patient named Gus Harper (Neil Haigh). The story culminates in Gus taking Al hostage in his cellar and tying him up. He then uses Al's mobile phone to lure Jas to his home and she discovers the truth. Relationships In 2014, Midlane signed a new contract to remain in Doctors due to the range of stories writers conjured up for him. His first romance story soon followed and they paired him with Niamh Donoghue (Jessica Regan). The story begins with Niamh developing feelings for Al, which he does not respond well to. Midlane explained that Al is still reminded of what happened with Jas and struggles to trust Niamh. He added \\"when someone seems to come to Al with warmth and real affection, he presses the alarm button.\\" Al and Niamh are both looking for someone to spend their lives with. They both want to settle down and commit, but Midlane noted \\"I think it'll be a question of whether one of them is really suitable for doing that.\\" Another issue is that Al lacks \\"emotional intelligence\\" and it is a \\"real struggle for him to open up his heart\\". The actor enjoyed filming the story and believed that viewers would enjoy watching Al and Niamh's \\"blossoming romance.\\" Writers have developed a double-act between Al and Jimmi. The pair were played as friends from Al's debut, with Midlane and Morgan later being nominated for a \\"Best On-Screen Partnership\\" award in recognition of their work together. In 2019, writers created a new business venture story for the pair as they open a new bar called The Icon. The story adds comic relief as their opening night is marred by their house beer going missing during transit. Flashback episode Producers decided to create an episode centric to Al's backstory via the use of flashbacks scenes. The scenes portray a young Al at school where he is bullied by fellow students. The episode also explains how the character became obsessed with science fiction and explores his relationship with his aunt Sheila Mills (Helen Phillips). In the scenes Al is played by Xandi Steele. Storylines Al started to stalk doctor Jas Khella (Vineeta Rishi) and, when he gets the blame for a much bigger stalk, he gets arrested - although he was not involved. Al is often seen as the clown of the practice, with a penchant for fast food, cigarettes and real ale. He had disliked receptionist Valerie Pitman (Sarah Moyle) until she developed cancer. The pair performed a magic act together and became friends. Al often refers to doctor Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan) as his best friend. Al attempted to walk to Lichfield and had different adventures along the way including a Bollywood Quiz and staying with a stranger. He ended up giving up. Following the death of her mother and her inability to come to terms with it, Al befriends and takes in practice nurse Ayesha Lee (Laura Rollins). She is instrumental in encouraging Al to make attempts to reconcile with his mother. Al had a relationship with fellow practice young doctor, Niamh. They split up when Al suggested that she should not be a doctor. In 2017, the character was developed further, with the introduction of Al's mother Eve, played by Rachel Bell, following the death of Al's father. Al had a difficult relationship with his parents but he tried to mend the rift following his father's death. When Eve begins a relationship with Ray Hopkins (Bruce Alexander), Al is suspicious of Ray's intentions. Al discovers that Ray has several other girlfriends, fianc√©es and wives, but forgets them due to having dementia. In November 2019, Al becomes inspired to start a business with Jimmi. When he hears that The Icon, the local restaurant, has shut down, he persuades Jimmi into buying it with him. Al hires Gareth Regan (Edward MacLiam) to be the manager of The Icon, but when Gareth is arrested for the attempted rape of Zara, it is revealed that Gareth stole from the business. Reception For his portrayal of Al, Midlane won the \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" accolade at the 2018 British Soap Awards. At the 2019 ceremony he and Adrian Lewis Morgan received a \\"Best On-Screen Partnership\\" and was solely nominated for \\"Best Male Dramatic Performance\\". He was nominated for \\"Best Daytime Star\\" at the 2019 Inside Soap Awards.

The vessels were intended for use as mine-sweepers and for anti-submarine warfare, and the design was based on commercial types, adapted for naval use. The purpose of the order was to make use of specialist mercantile shipyards to provide vessels for war use by adapting commercial designs to Admiralty specifications. Orders were placed at shipyards in Britain, Canada and India for the Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Indian Navy. Royal Navy Two vessels, Basset and Mastiff, were built by Henry Robb, of Leith. The main difference between them was that Basset had coal-fired, and Mastiff had oil-fired, engines.Conway p65 With the onset of war, Bassett served as the prototype for a series of Admiralty trawlers, of which a total of 180 were built during the conflict using a variety of naming schemes. The first 20 vessels were ordered under the 1939 programme (the Tree class), 30 vessels under the 1939 War Emergency programme in two groups (20 Dance class, and 10 Shakespearian class), and a further 130 over the next four years (the Western Isles (or, simply, Isles) class).Elliott p292-6 Royal Canadian Navy Four vessels were built for the Royal Canadian Navy at various yards; these ships had strengthened hulls to cope with pack ice conditions and were also known as the . A further 16 vessels were ordered from Canadian shipyards in the war years, also bearing Canadian names. These were for the Royal Navy, though eight of these were transferred on completion to the Royal Canadian Navy. These are usually referred to as Canadian s.Elliott p350-1 Royal Indian Navy A total of 50 vessels were ordered from Indian yards (including two for the Ceylon Government) though in the event more than half were cancelled.Elliott p404 Twenty-two were completed during the war; another 25 were cancelled and four were destroyed before completion when invading Japanese forces in 1942 over-ran their shipyards in Burma. These vessels bore the names of Indian cities, but are variously referred to as Indian Basset class or Indian Isles class trawlers.

The office originated in a rather unusual way, from a dispute between two rivals for the Office of Solicitor General for Ireland, Patrick Barnewall and Walter Cowley, but it survived for some decades, as it took some of the burden of work from the senior Law Officers.Hart, A. R. The History of the King's Serjeant-at-law in Ireland Four Courts Press 2000 p.34 Since both the Solicitor General and the Principal Solicitor were colloquially referred to as the Solicitor, there is some confusion as to who held which office at which time. The office was created on the personal initiative of Thomas Cromwell in 1537, in an effort to heal the Barnewall-Cowley feud, which he saw as weakening the position of the English Crown in Ireland. Cowley had made great efforts to force Barnewall to relinquish the office of Solicitor General, but Cromwell's compromise solution was to create a more junior office for Cowley.Hart p.34 Cowley was disgraced and removed from office in 1546,State Papers for the Reign of Henry VIII\\" Vol.iii p.584 but the Law Officers' heavy workload led to the Crown employing a Principal Solicitor until 1574, when the office seems to have lapsed on the death of Richard Finglas.Smyth, Constantine Joseph Chronicle of the Law Officers of Ireland London 1838 No clear reason for the disappearance of the office can be given, although Elizabeth I is known to have had a very poor opinion of her Irish Law Officers, so that possibly she preferred to leave the most junior office vacant.

Atex, Inc., 68 F.3d 1451 (2d Cir. 1995), is a veil piercing case by Judge Jos√© A. Cabranes in corporation law. Facts Plaintiffs filed a suit against Atex and Kodak alleging that repetitive stress injuries were caused by the use of Atex branded keyboards. Atex, although undergoing a renaming, was a wholly own subsidiary of Kodak until the sale of most of its assets. Atex's promotional material referred to Atex as a division of Kodak. The district court found in favor of Kodak on summary judgment and the plaintiff's appealed to the Second Circuit. Judgment The Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's finding in favor of Kodak. The court found that since Atex was incorporated in Delaware, that Delaware laws applied. The court then considered both an alter ego theory and an agency liability theory that could impute responsibility for Atex's actions to Kodak. The court also briefly discussed and rejected the possibility of Kodak being the apparent manufacturer or of concerted tortious action. Alter Ego Theory The court stated that to successfully move forward on an alter ego theory to impute liability for Atex's actions to Kodak, the plaintiff would have to show that both that the two companies operated as a \\"single economic entity\\" and that there would have to be some unfairness or inequity involved in not piercing the veil. The court emphasized that while fraud could be used to pierce the veil, it was not an essential element. In considering whether the two companies formed a \\"single economic entity\\" the court could consider: if the subsidiary was adequately capitalized, if it was solvent, if it paid dividends, how the records were kept, how the officers function, whether corporate formalities were observed, whether funds were taken away for use by the parent company, and if it operated as a facade.Fletcher, 68 F.3d at 1458, quoting The court ruled that these factors did not lead to a conclusion that it should pierce the veil, noting that using a cash management system and a limited overlap in the board of directors between the two companies was insufficient. Agency Theory The plaintiffs relied on statements made in Atex's literature that would indicate it was a division of Kodak and used the word agent directly. However, the court rejected this theory noting the lack of evidence that Kodak itself had authorized those statements. See also *US corporate law *Berkey v. Third Avenue Railway Co.

Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 79: 285-297 For example, in paper wasp species, Agelaia pallipes, social facilitation is used to recruitment to food resources. By using chemical communication, A. pallipes pool the independent search efforts to locate and defend food sources from other organisms.Davies, Nicholas., Krebs, John., West, Stuart. 2012. An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell. p.160. Social facilitation is sometimes used to develop successful social scavenging strategies. Griffon vultures are highly specialized scavengers that rely on finding carcasses. When foraging, griffon vultures soar at up to 800 m above the ground. Although some fresh carcasses are located directly by searching birds, the majority of individuals find food by following other vultures, i.e. social facilitation. A chain reaction of information transfer extends from the carcass as descending birds are followed by other birds, which themselves cannot directly see the carcass, ultimately drawing birds from an extensive area over a short period of time. Moller used a play-back technique to investigate the effects of singing by the black wheatear (Oenanthe leucura) on the behaviour of both conspecifics and heterospecifics. It was found that singing increased in both groups in response to the wheateater and Moller suggested the conspicuous dawn (and dusk) chorus of bird song may be augmented by social facilitation due to the singing of conspecifics as well as heterospecifics.Moller, A.P., (1992). Interspecific response to playback of bird song. Ethology, 90: 315-320.

Their response depends on the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic properties as well as the inherent microstructural features. In particular, microstructure depends on the applied processing techniques and starting materials, and in many cases macroscopic properties are linked to microstructure. Thus, understanding the effect of microstructure on the time evolution, response, and reliability of material properties is important. Garcia is interested in the application of theoretical and computational materials science to understand the relations between material properties and microstructure. Garcia's research places special emphasis on establishing analytical descriptions of complex processes and on the development of numerical algorithms and codes when microstructural simulation is required. Garcia is also interested in developing the means to optimize materials through fundamental understanding and graphical representation of the relations between processing, structure, and properties.

S‚ÄìR compatibility has been described as the \\"naturalness\\" of the association between a stimulus and its response, such as a left-oriented stimulus requiring a response from the left side of the body. A high level of S‚ÄìR compatibility is typically associated with a shorter reaction time, whereas a low level of S-R compatibility tends to result in a longer reaction time, a phenomenon known as the Simon effect. The term \\"stimulus-response compatibility\\" was first coined by Arnold Small in a presentation in 1951.Schmidt, R. A. & T. D. Lee. (2011). Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis (5th edition). Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics. (Ch. 3: pp. 57‚Äì95)  Determinants of reaction time   Visual location  S‚ÄìR compatibility can be seen in the variation in the amount of time taken to respond to a visual stimulus, given the similarity of the event that prompts the action, and the action itself. For example, a visual stimulus in the left of a person's field of vision is more compatible with a response involving the left hand than with a response involving the right hand. = Evidence = In 1953, Paul Fitts and C. M. Seeger ran the first experiment conclusively demonstrating that certain responses are more compatible with certain stimuli, during which subjects were alternatively instructed to press buttons on their left and right in response to lights which could appear in either the left or right corner of their field of vision. The study found that subjects took longer when the stimulus and response were incompatible. This was not in and of itself evidence for a relationship between S‚ÄìR compatibility and reaction time; an alternate hypothesis posited that the delay was simply the result of the sensory information taking longer to reach neural processing centers when hemispheres are crossed. This alternate hypothesis was disproven by a follow- up trial in which Fitts and Seeger had subjects cross their arms, so that the left hand would press the right button and vice versa; the difference between reaction times of subjects in the standard and crossed-arms trials was statistically insignificant, even though the neural signal traveled a greater distance. = Refinements and improvements = The reverse scenario was tested in a 1954 experiment by Richard L. Deninger and Paul Fitts, in which it was demonstrated that subjects responded more quickly when the stimulus and response were compatible. Solid evidence that S-R compatibility impacted the response planning phase was not found until 1995, when Bernhard Hommel demonstrated that modifying stimuli in ways unrelated to S-R compatibility, such as the size of the objects on the computer screen, did not increase reaction time.  Auditory location  This phenomenon also applies to auditory stimuli. For example, hearing a tone in one ear prepares that side of the body to respond, and the reaction time will be longer if one is required to perform an action with the opposite side of the body as the side where the tone was heard, or vice versa. = Evidence = In 2000, T. E. Roswarski and Robert Proctor conducted a variation of the original Fitts and Seeger experiment involving auditory tones in each ear instead of lights. The experiment showed that the reaction time for auditory signals is also influenced by S-R compatibility.  Motion  Another determinant of S-R compatibility is the destination of a moving stimulus. For example, an object moving towards the right hand is more compatible with a right-hand response than an object moving towards the left hand, even if the object is closer to the left hand when the stimulus is perceived.Proctor, R. W. & Kim-Phuong L. Vu. \\"Stimulus-Response Compatibility Principles: Data, Theory, and Application.\\" 2006, p. 114. = Evidence = An experiment by Claire Michaels in 1988 demonstrated the role of motion in determining S‚ÄìR compatibility. In this experiment, subjects were presented with a computer display with their hands extended, and a square on the screen would appear at some random location and move towards either the right or left hand. Choice reaction time was faster when subjects responded with the same hand the square was moving towards. This experiment showed that reaction time was affected more by the destination of the square than by its current location relative to the hand by showing that reaction time was even shorter when the square started in the middle of the screen than when it was close to the destination hand.  Affordance  Also important to S‚ÄìR compatibility is the type of stimulus; familiar objects tend to invite specific responses. As one example, if an object is perceived as more easily (or more typically) manipulable with one hand than the other, any response requiring use of the other hand will tend to have a long reaction time. = Evidence = In 1998, Mike Tucker and Rob Ellis conducted an experiment at the University of Plymouth which expanded the concept of S‚ÄìR compatibility to higher-order cognition. In their experiment, subjects were given two buttons, one on their left and one on their right, and shown a series of pictures of familiar objects like frying pans and teacups. For each image, they were asked to press the left button if the object in the image was upright and the right button if the object was inverted. However, the objects also varied in their rotation, such that the handles faced either left or right. The experiment revealed that seeing the handle pointing in one direction primed subjects to reach with the corresponding hand, which caused discrepancies in S-R compatibility that affected reaction time; for example, a subject seeing an inverted teapot with a handle pointing left took longer to press the button on the right than a subject who saw the same teapot pointing right.  Expectations  Prior knowledge and stereotyping plays a role in S‚ÄìR compatibility. If a required response is inconsistent with a person's stereotyped knowledge of a stimulus and its \\"typical\\" reactions, even if the person is aware of the necessary response in the new situation, compatibility will be low. For example, light switches in the United Kingdom are \\"on\\" when toggled down, but light switches in the United States are \\"on\\" when toggled up; a native of one country visiting the other will demonstrate low S-R compatibility when turning the lights on or off. As another example, red lights are universally associated with \\"stop\\" and green with \\"go\\", and a reversed configuration will result in a longer reaction time.Proctor, R. W. & T. G. Reeve. \\"Stimulus-Response Compatibility: An Integrated Perspective.\\" 1990, Ch. 1, p. 9.  Applications  S‚ÄìR compatibility is an important consideration in the field of human- computer interaction, and in software engineering. Programs are easier and more intuitive to use when the input of the user and the output of the program are S‚ÄìR-compatible. This would also be an important consideration in the physical design of objects...for instance, an electrical appliance with an on/off switch will be most intuitive if it is designed to conform to cultural expectations. Additionally, principles of S‚ÄìR compatibility are important considerations for psychology researchers; experiments may need to be controlled for the phenomenon. For example, behavioral neuroscience researchers should make sure that a task does not inadvertently vary along dimensions of S‚ÄìR compatibility.

Law and his wife Margaret Pestorius coordinated the Cairns Peace by Peace organisation. Law also disrupted logging activities on the World Heritage site Fraser Island. Early life Law was born in 1954 in the Brisbane suburb of Moorooka. Both his parents served in the army during World War II, His father in New Guinea and his mother in Townsville. Law attended Yeronga State High School, excelling in the sciences. He attended the University of Queensland, studying chemistry briefly before dropping out. He then worked briefly for the Education Department as a clerk. He subsequently drove taxis for 15 years in Cairns. In his thirties Law returned to Griffith University to study history and politics with a special interest in Asia and Pacific history and regional militarism. He was a campus activist and became President of the Student Union. Activism Law was radicalised during the government of Joh Bjelke Petersen and was first arrested at a large right to march street demonstration in Brisbane. He was arrested more than 30 times. Law blogged widely. He had ambitions to become a lawyer but felt he came from the wrong class at the wrong time. He revelled in the intellectual stimulation offered by the court room process. He was acknowledged by judges, barristers and adversaries as an honourable challenger.

In his later years the Catholic Worker tradition also influenced Law‚Äôs approach to nonviolence. Between 1982 and the mid-2000s, Law worked on a range of campaigns and was judged by colleagues as the \\"foremost nonviolence strategist in Australia.\\" He applied nonviolence theory and techniques to local, regional and national projects. Campaigns he was involved with included Aboriginal rights, which he initially explored in relation to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. He lived on Fraser Island during the blockade to interrupt logging. He was involved in local issues such as improving bicycle facilities, the Cairns Yacht Club and most recently the \\"Save City Place\\" campaign in Cairns.http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/10/16/10631_print- version.html He had a keen interest in opposing militarism and this became his primary passion. As an antimilitarist activist he first opposed visits of US and UK warships to Australia during the Bicentennial. It was during this time he started to explore the power of small group nonviolence. He teamed up with fellow nonviolent activist Margaret Pestorius and they followed their shared passion of educating ordinary people about the practice of nonviolence. With the Cairns Peace by Peace group they began citizens' inspections of visiting US warships at a time when Law considered Australia was in a state of perpetual war. In 2005 he entered Pine Gap spy base near Alice Springs with three other people from Christians Against All Terrorism. This action was a turning point in Law's pursuit of more powerful types of activity and ultimately led to his His work culminated fittingly in the regional Queensland town of Rockhampton at a time when most looked toward Canberra and Washington for political change. decision to conduct a ploughshare type action in Rockhampton during the 2011 Talisman Sabre Exercises.  Personal life  During the court case in Alice Springs in 2007 he probably had his first heart attack and his health declined consistently from that point. He struggled with diabetes and heart disease and their consequences. Law and Margaret Pestorius had a son, Joseph.

Soon afterwards, Pope John XXIII declared her patron saint of Uruguay.Virgin of the Thirty-Three The image was consecrated by Pope John Paul II in his visit to Uruguay in 1988. Devotion The Cathedral of Florida is the shrine where this image is venerated. Ever since the country's independence, there have been pilgrimages to it, for instance, in times of pests. The first National Pilgrimage was in 1908. A very important pilgrimage was carried out by bishop Miguel Paternain in 1945, covering almost one half of the whole country. A yearly pilgrimage is held every second Sunday of November. Places of worship The Virgin of the Thirty-Three has many churches dedicated to her: * Cathedral Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Thirty- Three in Florida * Parish Church of Our Lady of the Thirty-Three in Maldonado * Parish Church of Our Lady of the Thirty-Three in Treinta y Tres * Parish Church of Our Lady of the Thirty-Three in Montevideo * Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral has an important image of the Virgin of the Thirty-Three And there are also several chapels devoted to Her in all the country.

Two were built, but no production followed. Design and development In the early 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy became interested in the concept of two-seat fighters, as popular with foreign air-arms, ordering a prototype of the Nakajima NAF-1 6-Shi two-seat fighter in 1931.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p. 228. Although the NAF-1 was unsuccessful, the Navy's interest in two-seat fighters continued, and in 1933, it requested new two-seat carrier-based fighter designs from Mitsubishi and Nakajima. Mitsubishi's design, designated the Ka-8 by the company, and the Mitsubishi Experimental 8-Shi Two-seat Fighter by the Navy, was a single-engined biplane of mixes wood and metal construction. Its single-bay equal-span staggered wings had duralumin spars, with wooden ribs and fabric covering. The fuselage structure was made of welded steel tube with fabric covering, with pilot and gunner sitting in tandem in open cockpits. Two fixed forward-firing machine guns were operated by the pilot, with a single flexibly mounted machine gun in the rear cockpit. A twin tail was fitted, and the aircraft had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Powerplant was a single Nakajima Kotobuki, a licence-built Bristol Jupiter radial engine, driving a two-blade propeller.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 407. The first of two prototypes was completed in January 1931, with both prototypes being delivered to the Navy for formal testing later in the year. The second prototype broke up during diving tests at Yokosuka on 16 September 1934. While the pilot escaped by parachute, the observer in the rear seat was killed. This accident caused testing of the surviving prototype to be abandoned, with the Nakajima contender, the NAF-2, also being rejected, with the Navy abandoning the two- seater carrier fighter category.

South Carolina Conway business loop U.S. Route 501 Business in Conway, South Carolina is a former segment of US 501 that runs into downtown Conway. The route begins in Red Hill, and utilizes a flyover with part of the northern terminus of South Carolina Highway 544. The former terminus of SC 544 can be found at the next signalized intersection which is shared with a local street named French Collins Road. Shortly after this, it becomes the western terminus of SC Route 90. The rest of the road runs straight through rural forestland until it approaches the Waccamaw River Memorial Bridge (Main Street Bridge) over the Waccamaw River and after crossing the bridge enters Conway Downtown Historic District. The first major intersection within the district is U.S. Route 378 (Third Street). One block later, the road intersects SC 905 at 4th Avenue. North of there US Bus 501 passes by more historic sites in the city such as the City Post Office, the Beaty-Little House, the Burroughs School and others. At Collins Park Road/16th Avenue, U.S. Route 701 replaces US 501 Business as the designation north along Main Street while Business US 501 turns west joining that route in a wrong way concurrency, and west of Elm Street curves southwest. US Bus 501 ends at US 501 (Church Street), however 16th Avenue continues as a local street that terminates at US 378. Marion business loop U.S. Route 501 Business in Marion, South Carolina is a former segment of US 501 that runs into downtown Marion. The route begins south of Marion at a trumpet interchange, which also includes the beginning of a concurrency with SC ALT 41. The next major intersection, SC 576 veers off to the northwest towards Florence. Before the road enters the city, it is named South Main Street. However the road doesn't officially enter the city limits until just south of the Silver Trace Apartment complex, but the surroundings remain mostly residential, although a few commercial properties can be found as you drive further north. US Business 501 becomes a divided highway as it approaches the intersection with US 76(Liberty Street), but only at the southern approach of the intersection. The northwest corner contains a park with an obelisk. Between US 76 and Baptist Street, the west side of US Bus 501 includes a former segment of the road. At Godbold Street, South Main Street becomes North Main Street, which eventually enters the Marion Historic District which includes a former railroad line that's now part of the Marion Hike and Bike Trail. Right after the historic former Marion High School, which is on the NRHP and still the headquarters for the county school district,Marion County School District SC ALT 41 makes a right turn onto Jones Avenue. The road becomes more rural once again as it leaves downtown Marion, and the one last intersection with Paul Road and Meadowview Road exists before the route terminates at another trumpet interchange with US 501. North Carolina Laurinburg business loop Established in 1960 when mainline US 501 was bypassed around Laurinburg. US 501 Business, in concurrency partly with US 15 Business and US 401 Business, traverses along Jones Road, Main Street, and Aberdeen Road. Durham business loop Established in 1960 as a renumbering of mainline US 501, along University Drive and Roxboro Street, through downtown Durham. It is in concurrency with US 15 Business for majority of its route and is relatively unchanged since inception. Virginia South Boston truck route U.S. Route 501 Truck (US 501 Truck) is a Truck Detour around US 501 through South Boston. It begins at the intersection of US 58/360 and heads east overlapping those routes until the US 58/360 overlap ends, then turns onto US 360 until it reaches Hamilton Boulevard, heading northwest until finally reaching its parent route. Lynchburg business route View north along US 501 Bus. in Lynchburg U.S. Route 501 Business (US 501 Business) is a business route of US 501 in Lynchburg. The highway runs from US 29, US 460, and US 501 on the eastern edge of Lynchburg to US 501 on the western edge of Lynchburg. US 501 Business runs concurrently with US 460 Business on Campbell Avenue, a four- lane undivided highway, northwest from the highways' partial cloverleaf interchange with their mainline U.S. Highways and US 29. The business routes meet the northern end of SR 128 (Mayflower Drive) and cross over Norfolk Southern Railway's Blue Ridge District. Just north of the railroad, US 501 Business and US 460 Business veer onto Kemper Avenue, which crosses another rail line and has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 Business (Lynchburg Expressway); this interchange serves as the northern terminus of US 221. The business routes and US 221 pass through a commercial area and by the Anne Spencer House, then turn west onto 12th Street and cross Norfolk Southern's Danville District rail line a few blocks south of the Lynchburg-Kemper Street Station, which is served by Amtrak. At Campbell Avenue, US 221 and US 460 Business continue southwest on 12th Street while US 501 Business turns northwest onto Campbell Avenue, which becomes Langhorne Road after the intersection with Park Avenue. The business route intersects SR 163 (Memorial Avenue) at the historic home Centerview. West of Holy Cross Regional Catholic School, US 501 Business leaves the densely populated part of Lynchburg and curves north, passing under a former railroad bridge. West of the Rivermont Historic District, the business route veers onto Rivermont Terrace, then turns west onto Rivermont Avenue, which becomes Boonsboro Road at its intersection with Link Road. US 501 Business continues on Boonsboro Road to its northern terminus at US 501, which heads south on the Lynchburg Expressway and north on the continuation of Boonsboro Road. Buena Vista business route US 501 Bus. northbound at US 501 in Buena Vista U.S. Route 501 Business (US 501 Business) is a business route of US 501 in Buena Vista.

Just south of the Southern Virginia University campus, the business route veers northwest on Park Avenue, which the highway follows to its northern terminus at US 501 (Beech Street) just south of US 501's northern terminus at US 60. Buena Vista truck route US 501 marked as a truck route in Buena Vista U.S. Route 501 Truck (US 501 Truck) is actually mainline US 501 in Buena Vista marked as a truck route along Sycamore Avenue between Magnolia Avenue at 16th Street, and Park Avenue and Factory Street.

(Joseph) Donald Capra (born 1937) is an American immunologist, physician- scientist, and was the 4th full-time president (1997‚Äì2007) and later, president emeritus, of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) in Oklahoma City, OK. While president, he helped to raise over $100 million and spearheaded major research growth in grants funded and faculty recruited to the institution. Prior to becoming the 4th president of OMRF in 1997, Capra served as professor of microbiology and internal medicine and was named the Edwin L. Cox Distinguished Chair in Immunology and Genetics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, from 1974 to 1997, also serving as the director of the UTSW Molecular Immunology Center from 1990 to 1997. Before moving to UT Southwestern, he was a faculty member of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City between 1969 and 1974. Capra is widely known for his studies of monoclonal antibodies. His contributions to immunology have focused on the molecular features of antibody variable regions, including key discoveries related to the antibody combining site and its relationship to antibody idiotypy and the hypervariable regions of antibody molecules. He particularly studied the antibody combining sites and mutational genetics as they apply to both diseased and healthy states. Capra was an early leader in using human monoclonal antibodies from patients with lymphocytic malignancies helping to drive the field towards biopharmaceutical therapeutics, which now represents one of the largest segments of the pharmaceutical, diagnostic and research-based industries. He was also involved in the development of mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against human tissues that are widely used as diagnostic reagents. He was among those who defined the subsets of human B lymphocytes. These studies led to a redefinition of many human B cell malignancies, which became important in the treatment of many Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs Lymphomas. He also co-authored a series of papers which utilized human plasmablasts after immunization to define the human immune response to influenza vaccine and generated human monoclonal antibodies from the blood. These studies led to a single cell FACS-sorting based technology for the generation of monoclonal antibodies. Capra is the author of more than 320 peer reviewed scientific articles. He has co- authored/edited 2 books: The Antibody Enigma (1984) and Immunobiology 4th Edition (1999), co-edited seven volumes on The Antibodies with Maurizio Zanetti (1995‚Äì2002) and has served on the review and editorial boards of many journals. He also served on the board of directors for Innexus Biotechnology Inc. in Scottsdale, AZ., and the scientific advisory board of AssureImmune, LLC in Boca Raton, FL. He has also served on state agencies including chairing the scientific advisory panel for the State of Oklahoma EDGE Initiative.  Biography  A native of Vermont, Capra received his BS in chemistry in 1959 and his MD in 1963 from the University of Vermont in Burlington. At his graduation from the UVM College of Medicine in 1963, Capra received the William Brown Alumni Prize, named for a former dean of the College of Medicine, and the UVM Century Award. He interned at St. Luke‚Äôs Hospital in New York City between 1963 and 1969. He followed with postdoctoral fellowships at the National Institutes of Health with Dr. Alan Peterkofsky studying methyl deficient transfer RNA, and later, was a guest investigator and assistant physician under Dr. Henry Kunkel at The Rockefeller University in New York City between 1967 and 1969. Capra is a founding member of the Henry Kunkel Society, a scientific organization dedicated to human disease research in the memory of its namesake. It is made up of some of the world‚Äôs leading immunologists and physician researchers. Capra has served several positions with the organization including serving as vice president, president and past president. Capra has also been associated and/or trained many of today's immunologists, including Mike Carroll Ph.D., professor of pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Jeff Hanke, executive VP of inflammation/immunology Boehringer Ingelheim, Inaki Sanz, M.D., professor of medicine, chief, Division of Rheumatology, Emory University and Virginia Pascual, M.D., Baylor Institute of Biomedical Studies.  Memberships  Capra is a member of many scientific and professional organizations, including Sigma Xi, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Rheumatism Association, American Association of Biological Chemists, American Society for Clinical Investigation, Association of American Physicians, Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Honorary Member of the Societe Francaise d' Immunologie, and elected to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

Tom Swoon used to host Lift Off Radio on Electro City on Dash Radio. He debuted in the DJ Mags 2017 Top 100 DJs voting poll as No. 47. On 5 December 2017, Tomasiak drove drunk and was charged in a car accident that led to the death of one person and injured another. On 6 June 2018, Tomasiak announced the end of the \\"Tom Swoon\\" project in a public statement letter sent from prison. He was later sentenced to four years and eight months of prison. Biography Tomasiak was born on 6 June 1993 in Goleni√≥w, Poland. His interest in music started at a very young age. At the age of 17, he discovered electronic dance music and was inspired by artists such as deadmau5 and Daft Punk. Over the next few years, he taught himself the art of DJing and saved up his earnings and bought a proper DJ setup, transforming himself from a bedroom DJ into an artist with an unrivaled drive for music production. In late 2011, his first official remix of Gareth Emery's single \\"Tokyo\\" was released on Garuda and climbed into Beatport's Top 100 chart. This remix was followed by two other remixes for Steve Aoki and Kaskade, \\"Ladi Dadi\\" and \\"Room for Happiness\\", respectively. In March 2012, his debut track, \\"Elva\\", was released on Ultra Records. Two months later, he remixed Nervo's \\"You're Gonna Love Again\\" on EMI, his last release under the alias Pixel Cheese. Securing over twenty tour dates in his debut year to complement his original releases and remixes, Tom Swoon ended the year warming up for Avicii on his concert tour and on a tour of India with Steve Aoki. Nominated by Nervo as their 'Breakthrough Artist DJ for 2012', and voted as the \\"Polish Breakthrough DJ of the Year\\" by FTB Poland, both Mixmag and Billboard Magazine called Swoon an 'Artist to Watch' in 2013. With his remix of Bloody Beetroots - \\"Chronicles of a Fallen Love\\", he received further acclaim. His collaboration with Amba Shepherd, \\"Not Too Late\\", was followed by a remix package by Bassnectar and Patrick Reza, Maor Levi, Sebjak and Josef Belani. \\"Not Too Late\\" also premiered Tom Swoon's first official music video, which was shot and produced in Tokyo. Swoon was called in for another set of remixes for Nervo, Sultan & Ned Shepard's single \\"Army\\" and Benny Benassi's collaboration with John Legend called \\"Dance The Pain Away\\". In between such duties, Tom's fourth single, \\"Wings\\", was released in July and received support from a variety of dance musicians, with the remix by Myon & Shane 54 topping the Beatport trance chart at the No. 1 position for several weeks. In the third quarter of 2013, Tom Swoon released another collaboration titled \\"Rollercoaster\\", together with Josef Belani. On 29 October 2013, he released his remix of Burn It Down by American rock band Linkin Park, which was included in their album Recharged. In December 2013, Tom Swoon launched his own weekly radio show and podcast titled \\"LIFT OFF Radio\\", which was broadcast through iTunes and Soundcloud. In late 2013, he released \\"Synchronize\\", a collaboration with Paris Blohm and Hadouken!, which reached the No. 12 position on Beatport progressive charts and hovered for over a month on the top No. 20. 2014 saw the release of his collaboration \\"Wait\\" with Paris & Simo, which was released on Spinnin Records. Later that year, DJ Mag also revealed that he had placed 130th in voting for their annual Top 100 DJs poll.  Fatal crash and suspension of career  In the early morning of 5 December 2017 in his neighbourhood in Poland, he was driving his car under influence of alcohol and caused an accident killing one person and seriously harming another. The prosecutor's office accused him of causing an accident with fatal consequences while driving under the influence of alcohol. Tom Swoon announced in a public statement on 6 June 2018, that he will be ending his career in music. On 4 September 2018, he was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, after pleading guilty in court for manslaughter.

The February extent of snow cover in Eurasia and North America was above average, while the extent of Arctic ice in the same month was 4.5% below the 1981‚Äì2010 average. The Northern Hemisphere weather extremes have been linked to the melting of Arctic sea ice, which alters atmospheric circulation in a way that leads to more snow and ice. By January 11, 233 weather-related deaths were reported in India. Elsewhere, particularly in Russia, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom, low temperatures affected wildlife, delaying bird breeding and disrupting the bird migration. On January 10 Bangladesh faced the lowest temperature since country's independence, at in Saidpur. While Finland and most of Northern European countries got the record high, and even the highest temperatures at Europe during May and June, Western and Middle Europe faced much cooler weather and even their wettest May and June ever. During summer prolonged heat waves in the Northern Hemisphere set new record high temperatures. On March 24, 2014, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization Michel Jarraud announced that \\"many of the extreme events of 2013 were consistent with what we would expect as a result of human-induced climate change\\". Cold spring in the Northern Hemisphere In Northern Hemisphere the weather pattern repeatedly directed cold Arctic air southward, leaving Greenland and northeastern Canada much warmer than average for March. High pressure situated over Greenland acted as a block, forcing the jet stream into a southerly flow. Observations over Greenland threatened to break the worldwide record for highest barometric pressure of 1083.3 mb, set on December 31, 1968, in Siberia, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction‚Äôs Ocean Prediction Center forecast a high pressure center of at least 1074 mb over Greenland during March. A Greenland block was also noticed during the cold weather seen in 2010. The Arctic oscillation index changed from positive to negative, weakening the pressure gradient. Throughout March the west Atlantic winds, which normally kept the winters in Europe relatively mild, have been blowing chiefly from the northeast, bringing in cold Arctic air. The westerly Atlantic winds were weakened by small air pressure difference between northern and southern latitudes. In late March, the Arctic oscillation index dropped to -5.6 and much of Northern Hemisphere experienced particularly low temperatures. The low value of the Arctic oscillation was the second lowest March value on record. The British Met Office described the cold temperatures as part of a larger-scale weather pattern in the Northern Hemisphere, associated with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. North America =Canada= Due to expected low temperatures overnight on February 16 and 17, an extreme cold weather alert was issued in Toronto. On February 16 Environment Canada also issued a weather statement for York, Durham, Peel and Halton areas, warning of intensifying flurries. On December 22, a severe ice storm brought snow and freezing rain to Toronto, and much of Eastern Canada. The storm caused widespread power outages and left hundreds of thousands in the dark. =United States= The cold wave in the United States was influenced by a low-pressure area called a \\"Clipper\\" which brought an Arctic cold front that caused rapidly falling temperatures and strong northwest winds with gusts of . In Salt Lake City January, 2013 with the average temperature of became the coldest month on record since 1949 and the sixth-coldest January since 1874. On March 5 a record 6-inch snow depth was noted in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, exceeding the previous 1999 record for that date by 2.2 inches. On the same day 900 flights were cancelled in O'Hare Airport, while Midway Airport reportedly cancelled 240 flights. U.S. Airways reported 350 flight cancellations for March 6. In Orlando, Florida, the temperature lowered to on March 28, 2 degrees below the record of 1955. The lowest minimum temperature record of 1971 () was also broken in West Palm Beach, Florida, where a temperature of was recorded on March 28. On 1‚Äì3 May, a late snow storm occurred across the central United States from Arkansas to Minnesota. The storm formed from a deep upper level trough which became a cut- off low, the event was named \\"Achilles\\" by the Weather Channel. The storm broke records for depth of snow and lateness in the season, and was cited as the worst May snow since 1947. During mid- to late-May, the tornado outbreaks of May 18‚Äì21 and May 26‚Äì31 resulted in over 100 tornadoes, including an EF5 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, and an EF3 tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma. The related storms also resulted in record-breaking rains in North Dakota, New York, and Vermont. The tornado that went through El Reno broke the record for widest tornado ever recorded, at 2.6 miles wide. The October 2013 North American storm complex was a blizzard and tornado outbreak that affected the Northwest, Rockies, and much of the Midwest. The incident trapped over 6 dozen people inside of their automobiles and harmed 15 people in suburban Iowa and Nebraska. Rapid City, the second largest city in South Dakota, was engulfed in close to two feet of snow, which exceeds the amount of snow that the city has ever recorded during any whole month of October. Furthermore, on October 4, 2013, the city received over 1.5 feet of snow, which exceeded the previous one day record in October by more than six inches. Over 20 000 people lost electricity in Black Hills, where more than a meter of watered down, dense snow had fallen. The storm system also included thunderstorms that brought iced precipitation, significant rain and over half a dozen tornadoes to Nebraska and Iowa. Over 200 km of Interstate 90 were shut down from South Dakota to Wyoming. Tens of thousands of cattle were killed in South Dakota with ranchers reporting loss of 20 to 50% of their herds. Thousands of people were without power. Three people died in a motor vehicle accident on U. S. Route 20 in Nebraska. On December 6, a daily record snowfall of 0.1 inches (2 mm) is set in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex, breaking the old record of trace amounts of snow set in 1950. Europe During March a cold easterly flow across northern Europe from Russia brought intense snowfalls across the continent as it met moisture filled air masses from Ukraine to Ireland. =Czech Republic= Stopped on their annual way to the north by the cold weather, thousands of European golden plovers occupied the fields of central Moravia and southeast Bohemia. The cold weather also delayed the arrival of migratory birds that spend the summer in the Czech Republic. In P≈ô√≠bram the temperature on March 24 broke the 1883 record of , being 1.8 degrees lower. =Finland= In Finland, a cold wave hit on the first days of March 2013. The cold wave had very sunny and dry weather for over a month-long period and brought the lowest temperatures for the 2012-13 winter season. The lowest measured temperature (-38,2 ¬∞C) was recorded on March 13 in Taivalkoski. Total rainfall was less than 50% of the average in most parts of Finland. With 2-6 ¬∞C colder temperatures from 1981-2010 average, March was the coldest winter month in Finland from early 2013 after a mild January and February, and also the coldest March for seven years. =France= Northern France was hit by heavy snow beginning on March 11, with M√©t√©o-France warning of \\"dangerous weather of an exceptional intensity\\". French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault activated a crisis committee to coordinate government efforts to \\"guarantee security and movement of the country's citizens.\\" Snowfall across Normandy, Brittany and Picardy was up to 40 cm deep and drifting in 100 km/h winds. Eurostar suspended its cross-channel services between Paris and London. The storm also hit the Channel Islands, producing 8 foot high drifts on Guernsey with blizzards described as the worst since 1979 according to the Jersey Met Office. = Hungary = On March 15 tanks were deployed to reach thousands of motorists trapped in heavy snow. On March 22 the heaviest March snows in at least 400 years in Budapest canceled outdoor activities, related to commemoration of Hungarian Revolution of 1848. According to OMSZ, the country's meteorological service, this spring was the second wettest since 1901. = Germany = Mainz experienced a very cold March. The average high of 6.0 ¬∞C was 5.4 ¬∞C below the 1989-2018 mean (11.4 ¬∞C), and the coldest on record since 1917,ftp://ftp- cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate/daily/kl/historical/ leading to a very late onset of spring.

Many places in the south mountain area like Geilo, Haukeli and Hovden have their coldest average temperature in March on record. Many places had temperatures more than 5 degrees below average. =Russia= According to the Russian Bird Conservation Union, the cold weather in the European part of Russia stalled the bird migration, except for the rooks. The weather conditions also suspended the bird migration to Russian Far East. On March 3 thousands of snow rollers formed at the frozen surface of Sineglazovo Lake. On March 15 an all-time low temperature was recorded in Novosibirsk, surpassing the city's 1964 record by 0.5 ¬∞C. On April 1 the VVC weather station in Moscow recorded the city's highest snow cover since 1895, at 65 cm, which surpassed the previous record by 9 cm. =Spain= Spain saw unusual late April snow, with weather warnings in 18 provinces. The event was widely attributed to a cut-off low. =Ukraine= The Kiev State Administration declared a state of emergency in the city on March 23 \\"due to the deterioration of weather conditions [heavy snowfall, blizzards, snow-banks]\\". The government established a weather crisis center under direct supervision of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov. The weather conditions forced the authorities to make Monday, March 25, a day off for all those employed in the government sector in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, except medical services and those tackling the aftermath of the snowfall. March 23 brought heavy snow to Ukraine with the normal monthly amount of snow falling in just 24 hours. With the state of emergency declared the military used armoured personnel carriers to drag buses out of snow drifts. =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom experienced a very severe cold spell in March‚ÄìApril 2013. March was the coldest in the Central England region since 1883. The UK then went on to experience the most notable summer heatwave since 2006 with temperatures exceeding 28 ¬∞C (82 ¬∞F) somewhere for 19 consecutive days, on the 6th to the 24th and also values exceeding 30 ¬∞C on several days. The UK overall had a rather dry month compared to normal, with nearly all of the month's rain falling during the last ten days, often as thundery outbreaks. The highest temperatures was 33.5 ¬∞C (92.3 ¬∞F) at Heathrow and Northholt on the 22nd. The heat returned at the beginning of August with Heathrow recording 34.1 ¬∞C (93.4 ¬∞F) Africa =Egypt= On December 13 a cold snap led to snow in such cities as Cairo, Alexandria and Madinaty for the first time in 112 years. Asia =China= In China the average January temperature became the coldest in 28 years. In northeast China the average temperature in January 2013 decreased to , the coldest in 43 years, while in northern China it dropped to a 42-year low of . About a thousand ships were stuck in ice in Laizhou Bay, while 10,500 square miles of ice reportedly covered the surface of the Bohai Sea. About 180,000 cattle deaths were reported in northern China by January 10. On May 2, 2013, a minimum temperature of 16.6 ¬∞C was recorded at the Hong Kong Observatory, making it the coldest May temperature since 1917. It was also the third-coldest minimum temperature in May since recorded. =India= In January Delhi experienced night temperatures below , which was 4 to 5 degrees lower than the normal seasonal average. In the first week of January 2013, Delhi had a temperature of , the lowest in 44 years. The IFRC's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund donated 57,100 Swiss francs to support the Indian Red Cross Society in delivering immediate assistance to about 10,000 people. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar the cold wave dropped the mercury to as low as which forced closure of all schools up to grade 13 until January 12. =The Levant= On January 10, Lebanese cities and especially Beirut were flooded and snow reached the sea and the coast. Israel saw its heaviest snowfall since 1992 in Jerusalem, which accumulated 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) of snow in the city centre and more than that in outlying areas. The snowfall stalled the public transport and blocked a highway linking Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. A foot of snow (30 cm) fell at Safed in northern Israel. Lake Kinneret was refilling after years of drought. Much snow fell across Syria; -6 ¬∞C (22 ¬∞F) was reported in the east suburbs of Damascus and forced camping people made homeless by the Syrian civil war to desperate measures to find shelter, and caused 17 or more deaths in the Middle East. Perturbed European late spring and early summer After a cold March and early April in Finland and Scandinavia, a late, but very strong and widespread spring caused fast snow melting and flooding around Finland. Floods occurred mainly in the Province of Northern Ostrobothnia, where floods hit hardest in Pyh√§joki. In May the weather became exceptionally warm. Thermal summer began about a half-month earlier than usual throughout the country, and after mid-May Finland recorded nine heat-days (maximum temperature over 25 ¬∞C) for May 2013; whereas typically there are three heat-days in May. The heat of May 2013 also broke records around Finland's Lapland, which got the warmest temperatures of month. The highest temperature, 30,5 ¬∞C, was recorded at May 31, 2013, in Utsjoki. It was the first time the temperature rose over 30 ¬∞C in May since 1995, when in Lapinj√§rvi's Ingermaninkyl√§ was recorded Finland's highest all-time temperature of May, 31 ¬∞C. June also had exceptionally warm weather, with seventeen heat-days for the month, where eight heat-days is the norm. The highest temperature, 32,4 ¬∞C, was recorded on June 26, 2013, in Liperi. The hot weather brought unusual numbers of thunderstorms and lightning strikes. For June, 78,000 lightning strikes were recorded; the most recorded since June 1995. The single-day record, 28,500 lightning strikes, was recorded on June 27, the highest daily count for the 2000s and 2010s. May and June 2013 were both among the warmest five Mays and Junes in Finland's history. Germany and areas of Central Europe had their wettest ever May, followed by the severe flooding during the 2013 European floods. Summer heatwaves Southwest United States heatwave In late June 2013, an intense heat wave struck Southwestern United States. Various places in Southern California reached up to .Tata, Samantha. Palm Springs Hits 122 Degrees as SoCal Temperature Records Shatter. NBC Los Angeles. June 30, 2013. Retrieved on July 4, 2013. On June 30, Death Valley, California, hit which is the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth during the month of June. It was five degrees shy of the highest temperature recorded in Death Valley, which was , recorded in July 1913. European heatwave After six days in early July with temperatures over 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F), Portugal officially entered a heat wave. Temperatures reached as high as 45 ¬∞C in some places in Alentejo and Ribatejo. Rising temperatures led to heat health warnings being issued for Southern England and the Midlands in the UK's first prolonged heatwave since 2006 on 17 July. The UK recorded its hottest day since July 2006, with 33.5 ¬∞C (92.3F) recorded at Heathrow and Northolt in west London on 22 July. This was later beaten again on 1 August, when 34.1 ¬∞C was recorded at London Heathrow. Epidemiological statisticians at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine using models developed in 2011 estimated the heatwave in England and Wales would have led to the premature deaths of 650 people.

He was a member of the Arabian Barwani tribe. With the help of Tippu Tip he became Sultan of Ujiji. At one time he dominated the trade of Tanganyika, before being defeated by Belgian forces under Baron Francis Dhanis in January 1894. Background The trade in slaves from East Africa dates back thousands of years. Inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsular are documented as trading in slaves from the East African coast as early the second century AD. The Arabs established a series of trading posts along the coast which geographers referred to as the zanj. Through prolonged contact with the Arabs, a distinctive Swahili (\\"coastal\\") culture developed among the Bantu peoples of the region and some converted to Islam. Although the Swahili language has Bantu roots, it includes many words of Arabic origin. For many years, Zanzibar was considered part of the Omani Empire. The Swahili and Arab traders obtained slaves in the interior of East Africa and sold them in the great markets like Zanzibar on the coast. The Arab slave trade peaked in the nineteenth century in response to growing local and international demand. Biography Early life and trading activities Rumaliza was born at Lindi, on the Indian Ocean coast in the south of modern Tanzania, in around 1855. He was educated at Zanzibar during the reign of Majid bin Sa'id (r. 1856‚Äì70). He became a leader in the Islamic Qadiriyya brotherhood. The Arab trader Tippu Tip from Zanzibar increasingly pushed inland towards the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo and reached the Luba region in the late 1850s trading in slaves, ivory, and copper. Relying on force as needed to defeat uncooperative local chiefs, he steadily expanded his trading empire. In 1875, he established his capital as Kasongo. Rumaliza spent some time with Tippu Tip at Tabora in western Tanzania, and is said to have acquired his name from the nearby village or suburb called Rumaliza or Lumaliza. Rumaliza formed a trading alliance with Tippu Tip. The famous meeting of Henry Morton Stanley and David Livingstone at Ujiji in 1871 A market where salt could be exchanged for other goods was established at Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika in 1840. Tippu Tip and Ruwaliza established themselves there in 1881. From 1883 Rumaliza was the leader of the Swahili community at Ujiji. Rumaliza and his Magwangwara auxiliaries occupied five posts on the northeast coast of Lake Tanganyika between 1884 and 1894. He launched a series of raids into the mountains and up the Rusizi River valley as far as Lake Kivu. The HM Company, a trading organization led by Tippu Tip, appeared in 1883. It was backed by Sultan Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar and Taria Topan. The International African Association (IAA) offered their support if Tippu Tip would help them achieve control of the territories in which he had established strong points although it was notionally committed to eliminating the Arab slave trade. Tippu used trade goods advanced to the company to form an alliance with Rumaliza, who had many men but was short of money and could not obtain loans. The new company operated between Ujiji and Stanley Falls and in areas to the south of this line, controlled by Abdullah ibn Suleiman as lieutenant of Tippu Tip and Rumaliza. Between 1885 and 1892, after the death of Mwenge Heri, Rumaliza consolidated his power over the Masanze, Ubvari, Umona and Ubembi people. He wanted to open new trade routes towards Maniema to the west and Ituri to the north. In 1886 Tippu Tip recognized the Congo Free State, which superseded the IAA, and was made Governor of the eastern areas that were covered by his trading network. In 1890 Rumaliza provided large amounts of ivory to the African Lakes Company for transport. Taria Topan died in late 1891. Tippu Tip obtained part of the estate as payment for outstanding debts. Rumaliza sued for a share in the Dar es Salaam court as a newly-loyal subject of German East Africa which had consolidated control in modern-day Tanzania. He was awarded some of Tippu's property held in the German colony. Stories told in the Uele, Aruwimi, Tshuapa, Maniema and Kisangani areas, regions distant and far away from one another, associated Rumaliza and his parties with the kidnapping of women, cutting off men's genitals (to be captured and sold as eunuch slaves), cutting off legs, arms and hands, piercing of noses and ears, burning villages and killings.Osumaka Likaka (2009). Naming Colonialism: History and Collective Memory in the Congo, 1870‚Äì1960. University of Wisconsin Press. p. 104. Conflict with Christian missionaries Map of the Congo Free State at its creation in 1885. Rumaliza's stronghold at Ujiji is in \\"unclaimed territory\\" to the east of Lake Tanganyika. The Catholic White Fathers missionaries had established posts in the northwest of Tanganyika that formed an obstacle to Arab incursions into the Maniema region, protected by Captain L√©opold Louis Joubert, a former Papal Zouave. Rumaliza tolerated the foundation of the missions at Mulwewa in 1880 and Kibanga in 1883, but would not allow establishment of a station at Ujiji. In 1886,he tried to conquer Burundi but was defeated by the king Mwezi Gisabo in Uzige situated in the actual city Bujumbura. In May 1890 a group of Arabs came close to attacking the White Fathers mission at Mpala on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika, and only withdrew after a storm destroyed a number of their supply boats. Before leaving they confirmed that Rumaliza had given orders to them not to harm the missionaries. In September 1890 the White Fathers L√©once Bridoux and Francois Coulbois visited Ujiji, where they found Rumaliza and Tippu Tip. The two slavers were friendly, and Rumaliza was anxious that the missionaries gave a good report of him to Emin Pasha, who was expected at Ujiji. Rumaliza apologized for the hostility his men had shown to the missionaries, saying he was unable to control them. However, Rumaliza was determined to eliminate L√©opold Louis Joubert, commander of the forces defending the White Fathers, who was disrupting the slave trade. By 1891 the slavers had control of the entire western shore of the lake apart from Mpala and the Mrumbi plain. Joubert's position was ambiguous. The Belgians had appointed Tippu Tip as their lieutenant in the region, but Joubert refused to recognize the authority of the slaver. During a lull in January 1891, Father I. Moinet visited Ujiji where he found Rumaliza flying a German flag and saying he was waiting for the Germans to arrive so he could hand over to them. In a letter to Joubert in April 1891, Rumaliza asked if he was employed by the missionaries or by the government of the Congo. Joubert was evasive in his reply, pointing out that Rumaliza sometimes flew the German flag, sometimes the flag of Zanzibar and sometimes that of Britain. War and defeat Francis Dhanis in the Congo. His better-armed forces were to defeat Rumaliza The Congo Free State became stronger and less tolerant of Arab strongmen, determined to stamp them out. By 1892 Rumaliza dominated Tanganyika from his base at Ujiji on the old slave route that led from Stanley Falls up the Lualaba River to Nyangwe, east to Lake Tanganyika and then via Tabora to Bagamoyo opposite Zanzibar. The total number of Swahili fighters in this huge region numbered around one hundred thousand, but each chief acted independently. Although experienced in warfare, they were poorly armed with simple rifles. The Belgians had just six hundred troops divided between the camps at Basoko and Lusambo, but were much better armed and had six cannons and a machine gun. A Belgian expedition under Captain Jacques came to the relief of Joubert in 1892, and then established a position at Albertville where Rumaliza's troops were defeated by a relief column while besieging the post. The Belgian forces under Francis Dhanis launched a campaign against the slave dealers in 1892, and Rumaliza was one of the main targets. Dhanis advanced up the river. He reached Nyangwe on 4 March 1893 and Kasongo on 22 April 1893, finding both towns abandoned. He found a huge supply store at Kasongo including ivory, ammunition, food and luxuries such as gold and crystal tableware. For the next six months Dhanis remained inactive, while Rumaliza's forces were swelled by Swahili fighters who had escaped after defeat by Dhanis. In 1893 Tippu Tip advised Rumaliza to retire from the trade, but Rumaliza first had to look after his people at Lake Tanganyika. Rumaliza raised a strong force, which clashed with Dhanis' column on 15 October 1893 causing the death of two European leaders and fifty of their soldiers. On 19 October 1893 Rumaliza attacked a position one day's march from Kasongo. Dhanis concentrated his forces and defeated Rumaliza. A column under Captain Hubert Lothaire pursued him to the north of Lake Tanganyika, destroying his fortified positions along the route. At the lake they joined with the anti-slavery expedition led by Captain Alphonse Jacques. By 24 December 1893 Dhanis had obtained reinforcements and was ready to advance again. Rumaliza had also received assistance. Dhanis sent one column under Gillain to prevent Rumaliza from retreating, and another under De Wouters to advance on Rumaliza's fort near Bena Kalunga. A group of fresh forces coming to Rumaliza's aid from Tanganyika was headed off, and Dhanis's forces closed in on Rumaliza's two fortified bomas. On 9 January 1894 Belgian reinforcements arrived under Lothaire, and the same day a shell blew up Rumaliza's ammunition store and burned down the fort containing it. Most of the occupants were killed while attempting to escape. Within three days the other forts, cut off from water supplies, surrendered. More than two thousand prisoners were taken, although Rumaliza himself managed to escape. Rumaliza took refuge in the German territory of Tanganyika.

The Danish State now owns the company as an entity belonging to the Danish Central Bank. History Origins Production of coins in Denmark goes about 1000 years back. For the first 500 years it took place at various towns around the country. The first king to start a production of coins in Copenhagen was King Hans. It is believed that it took place in the cellar of his house. Owned by Magasin du Nord, the vaulted premises still exist today at Ving√•rdstr√¶de 6 where they form part of the restaurant Kong Hans K√¶lder. In 1541 the Royal Mint relocated to the nearby grounds of the former St. Clare's Monastery, which had been confiscated in 1536 when Denmark officially became a Lutheran nation. One of the streets which emerged as the city built upon the former monastery gardens was named Gammel M√∏nt () in memory of its occupation of the site. St. Clare's Priory in 1611 Changing locations It continued in this location until 1575, when the property became used as a place of worship by a German congregation. The Royal Mint was moved to Bremerholm, the Royal Naval dockyards, most likely in the anchor forge, which was later converted into Church of Holmen. The Royal Munt returned to the former monastery in 1593. From 1614 until 1661 the production of coins mainly took place at Copenhagen Castle, although other sites were also in use as mints during this period. A new currency, the Danish rigsdaler, was introduced in 1625. At Borgergade The Mint Master's House in Aarhus Gotfred Kr√ºger, who was the king's mint master from 1664 to 1680, acquired a property in Borgergade in 1671 while the production of coins took place in a neighbouring building. This lasted until 1749 when it was sold. The Mint Master's House was dismantled in 1943 and put into storage. It has now been rebuilt in the Old Town open-air museum in Aarhus. It was at Borgergade that the practice began of printing a heart on Danish coins. It is unclear whether this symbol originally signified the mint master family or the locality but since the initials CW for Winekes are often found next to it on coins from the time, the latter is assumed to be the case. At Gammelholm The Royal Mint and the Botanical Garden painted by Vilhelm Kyhn from a window in Charlottenborg in 1862 In 1749, at Nyhavn, a new Mint was established in the royal mews to the rear of Charlottenborg Palace. The buildings, which were located where Holbersgade crosses the Nyhavn Bridge, was demolished in the early 1870s to make way for the establishment of the new street when the entire Gammelholm area was redeveloped. The Royal Mint in Holbergsgade, illustration from Illustreret Tidende A new building for the Mint was completed on the corner of Holbergsgade and Herluf Trolles Gade in 1873. The building, which still exist today, was designed by Ferdinand Meldahl, who was also resonnsible for the overall planning of the neighbourhood, in collaboration with City Architect Ludvig Fenger. Special coins were from 1894 made by the company Fritz Meyer in Gothersgade (No. 14) for use in Angmagssalik on Greenland. On Amager In 1923 the Royal Mint moved once again when a new facility was inaugurated at Amager Boulevard 115 on Amager to designs by Martin Borch. The building is today owned by M. Goldschmidt Holding and has been converted into youth housing (150 units) and commercial space (23 offices). Current denominations The krone, which is divided into 100 √∏re, has been the unit of currency in Denmark since 1875. Coins denominated in values of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 25 √∏re were previously minted in Denmark, but they have been withdrawn. Now, the coin with the lowest denomination in circulation is the 50 √∏re coin. The rest of the circulating coins have denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 krone. The Royal Mint of Denmark has also minted commemorative coins in gold in silver. Current location In 1975 the Danish government placed the Royal Mint under the control of the Danish Central Bank, and in 1978 the mint moved to a location on Solmarksvej in Br√∏ndby. In March 2012 the offices of the mint were again relocated to Copenhagen, to the Danish Central Bank building on Havnegade. In October 2014, it was announced by the Danish Central Bank that coin and banknote production would cease by the Royal Danish Mint and the printing facilities at the Central Bank by the end of 2016 citing production costs and the anticipated decreasing level or demand of coins and banknotes. The Central Bank are making arrangements to tender out their production to private firms.

Twenty years after the Great Chicago Fire in 1891, Chicago‚Äôs population was a little over a million people. By the 1910s Chicago's population had risen to over two million, and by the mid-1920s the population was three million.

The reality that the new European immigrants were not doing well was also found in the extraordinarily high rates of European immigrant‚Äôs domestic violence in Chicago from 1875 to 1920. .Addler, Jeffery S. (2003) \\"We‚Äôve got a right to fight: We‚Äôre married‚Äù: Domestic homicide in Chicago, 1975 ‚Äì 1920. The Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 34 (1): 27 ‚Äì 48 Accordingly, in 1889, Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning social worker, Jane Addams (1860‚Äì1935) founded Hull House on Chicago‚Äôs Near West Side as a social settlement house ‚Äúto aid in the solution of the social and industrial problems which are engendered by the modern conditions of life in a great city.‚Äù She observed ‚ÄúChildren over ten years of age were arrested, held in the police stations, tried in the police courts. If convicted they were usually fined and if the fine was not paid sent to the city prison. However, often they were let off because justices could neither tolerate sending children to Bridewell nor bear in themselves guilty of the harsh folly of compelling poverty-stricken parents to pay fines. No exchange of court records existed and the same children could be in and out of various police stations an indefinite number of times, more hardened and more skillful with each experience.‚Äù Addams, Jane. (2004). My Friend, Julia Lathrop. University of Illinois Press: Champlain, IL, p. 133 In an effort to distinguish between criminality and juvenile delinquency, in 1899, Jane Addams and her female colleagues helped to start the world's first Juvenile Court in Chicago, Illinois, the Juvenile Protective Association. 1909 - Establishment of the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute Ten years later, in 1909, these foresighted women established the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute (JPI) in Chicago, the world's first child guidance clinic, and Mrs. Ethel Dummer provided funding for five years. Neurologist William Healy, M.D., its first director, is charged with not only studying the delinquent‚Äôs biological aspects of brain functioning and IQ, but also the delinquent‚Äôs social factors, attitudes, and motivations, thus it was the birthplace of American child and adolescent psychiatry.Schowalter, John E. (2000). Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Comes of Age, 1944-1994. In Menninger RW and Nemiah JC (Eds). American Psychiatry After World War II ‚Äì 1944 ‚Äì 1994. Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, p. 461 ‚Äì 480 These studies determined that there was no relationship between biological heredity and criminality. 1917 - The State of Illinois takes over funding of the JPI In 1917, these innovative women convinced the State of Illinois to take over the funding for the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute (JPI), and in 1920, the State of Illinois creates the Department of Public Welfare and changes the name of JPI to the Institute for Juvenile Research (IJR). IJR's goal was to develop an understanding of the causes of behavioral disturbances in youth by doing research and providing service to delinquent youth while also developing prevention strategies to prevent delinquency. IJR researchers Shaw and McKay [9] noted delinquency was less due to biological, ethnic, or cultural factors and more due to social disruption eroding formal and informal social control in specific transitional neighborhoods (\\"delinquency areas\\") in a city. In an effort to prevent delinquency the Chicago Area Project was born and was designed to create social fabric in \\"delinquency areas.\\" Directors Notable directors of IJR were Drs. Franz Alexander who was known for his work on Psychosomatic Medicine, short-term psychotherapy, and the corrective emotional experience Julius B. Richmond, M.D. a pediatrician who would later develop Head Start and served as Surgeon General of the United States under President Jimmy Carter, and Dr. Carl Bell (physician) who worked with President William Clinton cabinet members Janet Reno, Donna Shalala and David Satcher on issues of the violence against women act and youth violence. Multidisciplinary approach  During its early years, the institute was one of the first organizations to integrate the fields of medicine, psychiatry, psychology and social work into the study of child development, a multidisciplinary approach that continues to this day. It was at the IJR that professionals first recognized the importance of the larger community to the health and well-being of children. ‚ÄúPrimary emphasis,‚Äù noted pioneering IJR sociologist Clifford Shaw, ‚Äúmust be placed upon the task of revitalizing the life of the whole community so that the welfare of every child becomes the conscious and deliberate concern of all the citizens.‚Äù Innovations  IJR psychologist, Marion Monroe who investigated the relations of reading difficulties and delinquency was credited with developing methods for early childhood reading programs, which led to the Dick and Jane readers. In addition, Chester Darrow, Ph.D., set up IJR's psychophysiology laboratory, where he worked from 1926 to 1967, publishing over 150 scientific papers. He developed dozens of machines that measured the relationship of behavior to physiologic changes in the body, and, from these innovations, came early modifications of the Polygraphy machine (also known as the lie detector). Dr. Darrow's efforts also led to the development of the electroencephalograms, EEG, that records the deep electrical functioning of the brain. 1990 - IJR becomes a part of the University of Illinois In 1990, under the guidance of Dr. Boris Astracan, the Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry during that period, the Institute for Juvenile Research became a part of the Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago.

Originally established in 1907 as the Mission of St. Joseph, Our Lady of Perpetual Help is now one of two Catholic parishes in Glenview along with St. Catherine Laboure. The parish numbers about 3,000 families. As a result, OLPH celebrates no fewer than seven Masses every weekend. Rev. Jeremiah \\"Jerry\\" Boland is the current pastor, and Rev. Thomas E. Hickey is pastor emeritus. In addition, OLPH has three associate pastors and two deacon couples. History OLPH's history dates to the early 1900s. Although area Catholics at that time technically belonged to the parish of St. Joseph located in Grosse Pointe, now Wilmette, missionary priests often traveled to Glenview to minister to Catholics there. The original OLPH Church, located on the same site as the current structure, was dedicated in 1907 as the Mission of St. Joseph. In 1915, Rev. John Vattman renamed the parish Our Lady of Perpetual Help to commemorate a representation of the Virgin Mary that he had given to the church. OLPH‚Äôs resident pastor, Rev. Martin C. Schmidt, was installed in 1919, when Our Lady of Perpetual Help became a permanent parish. At the time, the small congregation was still considered a ‚Äúcounty parish.‚Äù According to legend, upon his appointment as pastor, Fr. Schmidt admitted he did not know where Glenview was located. When Fr. Schmidt asked George W. Mundelein, then the Archbishop of Chicago, the Archbishop purportedly answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôll have to look it up.‚Äù The church continued to grow throughout the 20th century, acquiring land east of the church building to construct a school and convent. Rev. John J. Dussman served as OLPH‚Äôs pastor for approximately thirty-four years, from 1934 until his retirement in 1971. Fr. Dussman was succeeded by Rev. Myles P. McDonnell, who served the parish until 1989. Rev. John E. Flavin served as pastor between 1989 and 2007, when recent pastor Thomas E. Hickey, was appointed to the role. On July 15, 2007, OLPH marked its 100th anniversary with a concelebrated Mass of celebration with principal celebrant Francis Cardinal George, the archbishop of Chicago. Upon election of Pope Francis in March 2013, then- pastor Fr. Hickey expressed his support for the new pontiff, saying that although the choice was a \\"surprise,\\" he believed the choice reflected the growth of Catholicism in the southern hemisphere. The pastor also expressed hope that Pope Francis would \\"convey a message of more openness and inclusiveness.\\" Features and ministries In 1915, Rev. John Vattman changed the parish name to Our Lady of Pereptual Help in honor of the Virgin Mary as depicted in this religious icon from the 15th century. OLPH considers itself to represent ‚Äúa family of believers in Christ who strive to live according to his teachings‚Äù that ‚Äútake as [their] mission in the world the living out of the Gospel of Jesus.‚Äù According to the parish website, OLPH ministries include care for the sick and bereaved, counseling services, a singles‚Äô group, business network group, men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clubs, and a youth organization. The parish is also actively involved in food drives and emergency meal assistance through its Meal Ministry. OLPH School In September of 1929, the founders of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church founded OLPH School true to the teachings of the School Sisters of St. Francis to teach the values of faith, discipline, and service. OLPH is the largest elementary and grade school in the Archdiocese of Chicago, and the current principal is Dr. Amy Mills. Today, OLPH teaches preschool through 8th grade and has over 800 students. OLPH is the home of the Warriors, and their mascots are Paul and Anne the Warriors, who are named after OLPH‚Äôs beloved nun Sister Paulanne.

With local branches throughout the country, it was the primary anti-Apartheid movement in the United States. Famous artists also got involved including Keith Haring who handed out over 20,000 'Free South Africa' posters. Formation The movement began on 21 November 1984 when Randall Robinson, Executive Director of TransAfrica, Mary Frances Berry, Commissioner of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, D.C. Congressman Walter Fauntroy and Georgetown University law professor Eleanor Holmes Norton met with South African Ambassador Bernardus Gerhardus Fourie at his embassy to highlight human rights abuses in South Africa. They demanded the release of political prisoners and refused to leave the embassy by staging a sit-in, which led to the arrest of Robinson, Fauntroy and Berry. Norton was not arrested because she was addressing the media outside of the embassy, which had been notified beforehand. The sit-in was planned for Thanksgiving Eve to ensure wide press coverage.\\"Chronology of the Free South Africa Movement.\\" http://transafrica.org/fsam-history/ Accessed 4/26/2015 Thereafter, Trans-Africa organized daily protests outside the embassy. These protests helped create FSAM. Robinson's organization, Trans-Africa, was a founding member of FSAM, and played a key role in its development. They continued their strike outside the embassy and solicited high-profile individuals to join the protests. The FSAM had three major objectives. One was to build awareness among the American general public of apartheid through a strategy of civil disobedience and demonstrations that elicited media coverage. The second objective was to begin a change in the U.S. policy of constructive engagement toward South Africa. The third objective was that once American policy changed that it would begin to influence other Western countries to follow suit Randall Robinson and Clarence Lusane. \\"An Interview with Randall Robinson: State of the U.S. Anti-Apartheid Movement.\\" The Black Scholar, Vol. 16, No. 6, p.41.  Anti-Apartheid protests After the formation of FSAM, demonstrations at South African consulates continued. This included various celebrities and activists who tied themselves to trees. Within a year, more than 4,500 arrests had followed. Local branches of FSAM formed in cities across the country. Significance The combined leadership of FSAM, TransAfrica and the Congressional Black Caucus together with the commitment of private citizens around the country led to the passage of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. Many European countries followed suit by enacting their own sanctions. FSAM is arguably the most important and successful initiative undertaken by black private citizens since the Civil Rights Movement. It expanded the influence of African Americans in forming US foreign policy.

After school he joined the University of Ceylon, Colombo, graduating in 1948 with a degree in economics. Moorthy married Suseela, daughter of P. Sriskandarajah, in 1959. They had two daughters (Uma and Ima) and a son (Sri Ayilavan). Career Moorthy joined the Ceylon Overseas Service in 1953 and his first diplomatic posting was in Jakarta, Indonesia. He became charg√© d'affaires of the Ceylonese embassy in Beijing, China in 1957, meeting leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. He was first secretary at the High Commission of Ceylon, London between 1961 and 1963. During this time Moorthy and Suseela studied for the bar at Gray's Inn. He was called to the bar in 1965. Moorthy then served in various diplomatic positions: first secretary in West Germany (1964-66); charg√© d'affaires in Thailand (1969-70); permanent representative to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East; and charg√© d'affaires in Iraq (1970).

After the 1979 Iranian Revolution Moorthy played an important role in Sri Lankan government's attempts to free the US hostages in Iran. In 1981 Moorthy was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Back in Sri Lanka violence against the country's Tamils escalated, culminating in the Black July riots of 1983. Sinhalese expatriates living in the UK started a campaign to have Moorthy replaced by a Buddhist Sinhalese. He received a letter, allegedly from a member of the Sinhala Association in UK, threatening his life. The Sri Lankan government ordered Moorthy to declare that his appointment was evidence that there was no serious discrimination against the Tamils. Moorthy refused make such a declaration and resigned in 1984. Moorthy and his family remained in the UK. He died on 1 April 2008 in London.

Described by development driver Frank Gardner as \\"the most sophisticated Formula 5000 to be built so far\\", the T400 was a completely new design, strikingly different from its T300, T330 and T332 predecessors. Description But with a heavily revised aerodynamics and suspension system the T400 baffled and perplexed teams. The radiators were mounted in front of the rear wheels, as part of the mandatory deformable structure, so the aerodynamics could be significantly cleaner. However, the key difference was designer Eric Broadley's adoption of rising rate suspension, with rocker arms and inboard springs, both front and rear. This would, eventually, prove very successful but at first nobody really understood how to make it work. Shock absorbers This design was not only the first to move the shock absorbers inside the bodywork and out of the air-stream, but both mounting points of the shocks moved with the suspension, increasing the spring rate and shock damping with the movement, and therefore referred to as \\"rising rate\\". Haas and Vel's Parnelli Jones, the top two US teams, quickly forgot about their T400s and wheeled out their 1974 T332s. In Australia, the two leading drivers had returned to their earlier cars mid-way through the Tasman series but later persevered with the T400s and eventually made winning cars out of them. In the UK, VDS also pressed on and got one of their cars working really well at the end of the season; four wins in the last eight races securing a second F5000 title for Teddy Pilette. Of 27 top 3 finishes in the US, the T332 took 20, including all nine wins, the T400 just three and everyone else put together shared the other four. Suspension system Eventually, the very advanced and complex suspension system was figured out by Lola and updates and chassis setup instructions tamed the beast. However, the US series ended in 1976, so little time was available to demonstrate the T400's full potential. In recent years sophisticated computer modeling has been used to further enhance the T400's chassis performance. Two of the 14 T400s were wrecked in accidents but the recent whereabouts of all twelve of the survivors are known.

He attended the \\"School of the young historian\\" at Moscow State University. Upon leaving for the summer holidays to visit the village of Semenovskoe, near Tver, he listened with great enthusiasm to stories of old \\"former life\\" and gathered together local folklore, including songs, stories, plots, bylichki and legends.

Russian, English In 1990, Veleslav graduated from high school, but instead of going to the MSU faculty of history and philosophy as his family and friends expected, he announced that he was not interested in a career as a scientist, historian or philosopher, claiming that they \\"speak of truth, without knowing her\\". After sewing together a Russian burlap shirt, he stopped eating meat, cut his hair, and began practicing yoga as well as other spiritual disciplines. At that time in Russia there were many different sects and spiritual teachings, and the ROC began to gain momentum. Veleslav communicated with the followers of these groups and was interested in the essence of their teachings, but he did not join any of them, considering that truth is \\"realised in the heart, and not by following any doctrine, church dogma, or the partial view of a religious leader.\\" Author In 1992, Veleslav wrote his first book, \\"Samizdat\\", \\"The Doctrine of the Heart.\\" Soon Veleslava gathered around him a small group of like-minded people who were united by a spiritual quest. On February 24, 1998, together with like-minded people, Veleslav announced the creation of the Russian-Slavic Rodnovercheskoy Communities, \\"Rodoljub\\", and a spiritual and educational society, \\"Satya Veda\\" (Sanskrit, \\"True Knowledge\\"), which during the first year operated as a single unit. According to Veleslav, > this date (February 24, 1998) marked the official date of his community. > This was followed by a period of relatively short duration (one year), but > which was nevertheless very significant in its results. It was at this time > that the foundation was laid for the future community: developing and > maintaining a ritual practice; and a worldview was formed... May 12, 1998, > was the date of the first public ceremony for the reconstructed houses in > the near Teply Stan. The ritual began with the worship of Veles, the Slavic > God of Wisdom, Spiritual Patron of the community, and was aimed at the > reunification of the participating forces with Native Gods. One year the > community's pagan temple was desecrated by Christians: a ritual statue of > Veles was thrown into the running water of a nearby stream; a stone Alatyrny > svorochen was thrown from a mountain, and the remaining logs were cut with > \\"Orthodox\\" crosses. This caused the community to equip a new temple in the > more distant location where it still stands today. In 1999, Veleslav, together with a group of Commonwealth Communities, created the \\"Veles Circle\\", which still exists today. The stated objectives of the Veles Circle are: #Restoration, conservation and enhancement of the spiritual heritage of their ancestors. #Practical development and implementation of the Volkhov Knowledge (Vedaniya). #Research and spiritual outreach.

He was the president of The Simmons Company from 1910-1932. He inherited the company in 1910 from his father, Simmons Company founder Zalmon G. Simmons. Z.G. II was commonly referred to as \\"the Chief\\" for his ability to recognize possibilities and make decisions that many felt were foolish but would prove to be extremely profitable. It is reported that Simmons once wagered an automobile a hole in a game of golf. His unshakable character increased the company's profits from less than $5,000,000, when he became president, to over $40,000,000 at the peak of his incumbency and revolutionized the bedding industry.  Personal life  Zalmon Gilbert Simmons II, child Zalmon Gilbert Simmons II Zalmon Gilbert Simmons II was born on November 2, 1870 to Zalmon Gilbert Simmons and Emma E. Robeson in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He was youngest of six children and family's only surviving son. As a boy Zalmon attended Manlius Military School in Manlius, NY. In 1891 the school became St. John's Military School. While in attendance he excelled in academics and baseball. His love of baseball would continue throughout his life; a 7 he developed one the country's best industrial baseball teams at his Kenosha, Wisconsin plant with an initial investment of $300,000. Zalmon G. Simmons II, Manilus Military School After returning home from military school Zalmon married Francis Ethridge Grant, the daughter of a Wisconsin lumberman, on September 6, 1892. Over the next four years the couple had two surviving children. Grant Gilbert Simmons was born on December 25, 1893 followed by his brother Zalmon Gilbert Simmons, Jr. on March 12, 1898.  Life in Greenwich, Connecticut  In 1923 Zalmon and Francis moved their family to an \\"exquisite\\" manor in Greenwich, Connecticut. The Simmons estate was said to be the equivalent of many of the ch√¢teaux in France and stately homes in Europe. The interior was designed by the world-renowned Elsie de Wolfe. :\\"It featured hand-painted chinoiserie wallpaper, black marble floors with inlaid copper, and a study paneled with pine that had been stripped from a venerable mansion in London. The main house had six maid's rooms. Outbuildings included a stable for horses, two greenhouses, a six-car garage, and a guest-house with its own courtyard; as well, Simmons built a pair of two-family cottages to house the butler, the chauffeur, the head gardener, and the estate superintendent. For their two sons, Zalmon junior and Grant, Zalmon and Francis built two more houses on the estate. \\" While living in Greenwich Z.G. II became involved with the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville where his sons were enrolled. He was a large supporter of the school and donated $125,00 to the institution. In 1932 Z.G. II became Chairman of the Board and his oldest son Grant took over as president of The Simmons Company. This gave \\"the Chief\\" an opportunity to enjoy retirement at his 164-acre estate in Greenwich, Connecticut. In the years before his death Z.G. II had become a passionate horticulturist. In the season before his death he planted on 3,000,000 iris bulbs throughout the gardens of the massive property. In early April 1934 Zalmon was hospitalized at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland where he underwent major surgery for an intestinal ailment. He remained hospitalized for two weeks before his death on April 26. His wife Francis and two sons Grant and Zalmon Jr. were at his side at the time of his passing. After the death of Zalmon G. Simmons II the family's Greenwich estate was sold off in pieces. In 1938 George Skakel purchased the main house along with ten acres of land. Skakel, founder of the Great Lakes Carbon Corporation paid Francis Simmons $160,000 for the property ($2 million today). The self-made millionaire purchased the property for his wife, Ann Brannack, and their seven children. In 1950 Skakel's daughter Ethel married Robert F. Kennedy at St. Mary Catholic Church. Following the wedding the family held a reception at the estate for over 2,000 people, including John F. Kennedy who was the best man. The former Simmons estate was location of the social event of the year.  Simmons Company  Zalmon G. Simmon II, The Chief  Evolution of the Company  The Simmons Manufacturing Company was known from its inception for woven wire mattress springs, cradles, metal beds and wooden folding chairs. In 1916 Zalmon II looked to expand the company nationally. The Simmons Company purchased the Rudger-Merle Company in San Francisco followed by a plant in Los Angeles. In 1918 the company purchased of the largest bedding company in the east, New Jersey's Newark Spring Mattress Company. This acquisition extended the company's product lines from cradles, metal beds and woven wire bed springs into the padded bedding and mattress industry. Z.G. II's desire to revolutionize the company would eventually lead to a mass-produced pocketed coil innerspring mattress known as the Beautyrest. The success of this new business venture led to the purchase of Atlanta, Georgia mattress maker Hirsch and Spitz and a Seattle plant in 1919. With the company's new acquisitions, Simmons Manufacturing Company was officially in the mattress business. Z.G. Simmons II, known by now as \\"the Chief\\", continued to find ways to improve and expand. Z. G II innovated a nationwide service station program. Through this system retailers were given samples of Simmons products for the consumer to view. When the customer placed an order it was delivered within 24 hours from one of Simmons warehouses. These company advancements led to the decision to move his family and his company offices east in 1923. He relocated the Simmons Company headquarters to 280 Park Avenue in New York City. This same year The Simmons Company stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Beautyrest Mattress  When Zalmon G. Simmons II took over the company after his father's death in 1910 he continued the tradition of innovation set by his predecessor. The greatest example came in 1925 with the introduction of the Beautyrest mattress. This new mass-produced innerspring mattress was made of individual cloth pocketed coils that contoured to the body and led to a new world of sleep comfort. While the younger Simmons did not invent the pocketed coil innerspring mattress he facilitated a way to mass-produce it. In 1901, a planning mill operator in Canada named James Marshall patented the first innerspring mattress with individual cloth pocketed coils. He produced the inner-springs with a machine that hand cranked a single coil that was then sewn into a cloth pocket. The process was repeated multiple times to create one mattress. Since the Marshall inner-springs were made by hand they were very expensive, appearing only in few lavish hotels and on luxury ships such as the Titanic and the Lusitania. When Marshall's patent expired in 1917 the mattress was still unknown to the majority of the general public. Z.G. Simmons II knew the Marshall innerspring was a quality mattress but the price kept it from being a profitable product. In 1922 he charged a top Simmons engineer named John Franklin Gail with the task of inventing a machine that could mass-produce pocketed coil inner- springs. Gail was sent to Evanston, Illinois, away from the distractions of the Kenosha plant, with instructions to work on no other project until it was completed. After three years of dedication Gail finally returned to \\"the Chief\\" with the \\"Beautyrest Pocket Machine\\", a piece of machinery that revolutionized the bedding manufacturing industry. The release of this new mattress, that brought comfort to the Everyman, not only changed the manufacturing industry but also the sales and marketing industries. Zalmon II used his company's new creation to set retail pricing, something that was unheard of at the time. He was also able to sell it for three to four times the price of other padded bedding because of his belief in educating the masses on the importance of good sleep combined with faith in effective marketing and advertisement. In its first year of production the Beautyrest sold 16,168 units with effective marketing campaigns sales drastically increased to 464,214 by 1929.  Marketing and advertising  In 1925 Z.G. Simmons II made the decision to set the retail price for the new mattress at $39.50. This was unheard of at the time for two reasons. At $39.50 this was three to four times the cost of the solid pad mattress that were commonly sold, there was also an objection to a manufacturer setting the price. Despite the countless objections to the plan, \\"the Chief\\" refused to back down. Simmons's resilience proved to be a great asset for the company. He believed that despite the obstacles, with a great marketing campaign and the ability to stress the importance of good sleep his mass-produced innerspring mattress would be a great asset to The Simmons Company. The company had a contest for its employees to name the new mattress. When all votes were in the name Beautyrest won just barely over \\"Sleep Comfort\\" and \\"Slumber Well\\". On September 19, 1925 the Saturday Evening Post ran the first full page advertisement for the new Beautyrest mattress with its innerspring pocket coils and a headline that read, \\"Give Your Tired Brains and Body This Chance to Renew Their Energy Every Night\\". The following year the first announcement of the \\"Simmons Fellowship of Sleep\\" at the Mellon Institute was published in The Ladies Home Journal. It questioned the importance of sleep and announced, \\"Realizing the importance of sleep to mankind, The Simmons Company began to throw what light it could on the subject more than ten years ago. But the available facts were inadequate. More must be known. \\" After this first wave of announcements, Simmons ran a series of advertisements from 1928-1929 in The Saturday Evening Post that featured celebrities such as H.G. Wells, Thomas Edison, George Bernard Shaw and Henry Ford. While they did not directly mention the Beautyrest name, the image of national heroes endorsing the importance sleep in relation to achieving health and success next to a picture of the Beautyrest mattress was an instant draw. Sales of the Beautyrest mattress jumped from 16,168 units in 1925 to 464,214 in 1929. As the popularity increased so did the clout of the celebrities in the promotions. Admiral Byrd announced in a radio communication from the Antarctic that, \\"Beautyrest gave our crew perfect slumber\\". After Will Rogers underwent a surgical procedure he sent a wire stating that \\"THERE SHOULD BE A LAW THAT NO PERSON IS ALLOWED TO BE OPERATED ON WITHOUT HAVING A SIMMONS MATTRESS TO RECUPERATE ON\\". Eleanor Roosevelt even committed to a series of weekly radio commercials for Beautyrest. Simmons and Beautyrest became synonymous with sleep.  Study of sleep  The creation of the Beautyrest mattress ushered in a new era for The Simmons Company. Zalmon was no longer just selling mattresses but the complete experience of sleep. From 1924-1932 The Simmons Company with a grant from the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research created the first sleep research program with the goal of perfecting the art of sleep. The first sleep study observed the nocturnal habits of twelve young men for several months. Simmons facility at the Mellon Institute in Oakland, Pennsylvania consisted of an eight bedroom suite where researchers could measure different variables during the sleep trials. Including: * Brain Waves * Heart Rate * Respiration Rate * Muscle Tension * Body Temperature * Body Movement The study found that: \\"People do not sleep like logs; they move and turn from twenty-two to forty-five times a night to rest one set of muscles and then another. \\" These new findings led to a new kind of advertising. Instead of simply selling a product the Simmons Company was now selling an experience. The company hired the Charles Daniel Frey Company advertising agency to head up the new campaign. Frey created many influential ad lines that, along with the new revolutionized mattress, sold sleep to a new generation. Some of Charles Daniel Frey's most memorable ad lines include: * \\"Loss of Sleep cost Napoleon his empire. \\" * \\"Don't trifle with success; let sleep rebuild your energy. \\" * \\"What rest equals this- to sleep- and not to know it? * \\"Doug\\" Fairbanks says most people are only half awake. \\" * \\"Eight hours or more in bed yet you starve for sleep. \\" * \\"When you lie awake, think of the secret of sound sleep. \\" * \\"Do you buy your bedding as intelligently as your clothes?\\" All of the ad lines not only encouraged consumers to desire a better sleep experience but also complimented the Simmons motto: Built for Sleep.  Business expansion  He increased the number of facilities from a single manufacturing plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin to a total of twelve manufacturing plants: six in the United States, five in Canada and a plant in Monterey, Mexico by 1925. They were also able to increase the number of domestic and international distribution warehouses. In addition to the sixty- seven domestic distribution centers the company also owned warehouses in: The increase in facilities worldwide coupled with the release of the Beautyrest mattress created monumental gains for The Simmons Company. In 1917 the company's total sales were $14,848,998.23 by 1925 sales grew to $32,684,279.30.

As the head coach from 1973‚Äì78 and 1980‚Äì81, Gettleman led his teams to two league titles, competing against schools twice the size as Spackenkill. He spent a season as a volunteer assistant at Cal State Long Beach in 1979. Gettleman joined the faculty of Kingston High School in 1982 and became the head coach in 1984, leading his team to a Section I Bowl berth. Front office He entered the NFL in 1986 as a scouting intern for the Buffalo Bills. He spent the next seven years working in their scouting department before leaving to accept a scouting job with the Denver Broncos after the 1993 season. In 1998, he was hired by the New York Giants, who promoted him to Pro Personnel Director the next year. In 2012, he was given the title of Senior Pro Personnel Analyst. In January 2013, he was chosen to become the general manager of the Carolina Panthers. In the 2015 season, the Panthers reached Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016.

Geography Hatchford rests almost wholly on the high Bagshot Formation (above the flood plain of the River Mole), on a country road between Cobham, Martyrs Green, Ockham and Downside. The hamlet is bisected into Pointers Green main sub-localities by the M25 motorway. Etymology Early maps and references to the area relate principally to the historic house that is now called 'Hatchford Park', but which was at earlier times referred to simply as 'Hatchford'.Brayley, E. W. A Topographical History of Surrey, London: Virtue & Co., volume 2, pp. 151-2, available online at https://archive.org/stream/topographicalhis02bray#page/n7/mode/2up (accessed 14 March 2013) As the hamlet grew in the late nineteenth century, however, the name was applied more broadly, with the historic house taking the name 'Hatchford Park' to distinguish it. The name has also changed over time: it appears on Rocque's Map of Surrey of 1765 and Cary's 1786 map as 'Hatch Fold'.Cary, John (1786) Cary's new and correct English atlas : being a new set of country maps from actual surveys, Published London 1787. It was still 'Hatchfold' in the Ordnance Survey map of 1816. By the time of Brayley's 1848 Topological History, however, it had become 'Hatchford'. History 1786 Map of Hatchford and surrounding area The house at Hatchford Park was originally built in the 1600s, but little physical evidence of this survives. In the nineteenth century, it became the home of Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, who rebuilt the house in the 1850s. Lord Ellesmere started an arboretum in the grounds in 1845, while Lady Ellesmere laid out the gardens. The garden writer William Keane included the gardens in his book The Beauties of Surrey. Lady Ellesmere lived on at Hatchford Park after the 1857 death of the 1st Earl. Her mother, Lady Charlotte Greville (n√©e Cavendish-Bentinck) died at Hatchford Park on 28 July 1862, aged 86. The estate was later purchased by Isabella Saltonstall, a patron and executor of the painter George Stubbs. The main house was remodelled in c1890 by Rowland Plumbe in mock Jacobean style for its then owner, the City stockbroker, Walter Moresby Chinnery. It then became the home of Bernhard Samuelson MP, who built a mausoleum in the grounds. Its last private owner as a single house was the steel magnate William John Firth, who lived there in the 1930s. During World War II Hatchford Park was taken over by the War Office, as were some other properties in the area. In 1952, it became Hatchford Park School, a residential school for children with disabilities. In 1969 it was used as a filming location for Spearhead from Space an episode of Doctor Who broadcast in 1970. In the 1990s, Hatchford Park was bought by property developers for conversion into private apartments. During the redevelopment, a fire was started which severely damaged the manor house and destroyed many of the original features. Hatchford Park immediately after the severe fire that was started during renovations At the same time as remodelling the main house, Lord Ellesmere also gave land and funds to build a small church, St. Matthews, on his estate.Langham-Carter, R. R. \\"Hatchford Park & Church\\" in Harrison (ed.) Surrey Archaeological Collections, Relating to the History and Antiquities of the County, Volume 61; published by Surrey Archaeological Society, 1964 available online at https://archive.org/stream/surreyarchaeol61surr/surreyarchaeol61surr_djvu.txt (accessed 14 March 2013) In 1865, the church was endowed as a parish within the Diocese of Winchester with the Earl of Ellesmere as patron. However, the church was demolished in the 1960s due to disrepair, leaving only the graveyard, which remains in use; the community is now served by parish church of Ockham (All Saints') and the small chapel of St. Matthew in Downside. Hatchford End, built near Hatchford Park in 1752, was given to house the estate chaplain. In the 1920s, the 4th Earl bought Hatchford End as a home for his three unmarried sisters (Lady Blanche Egerton, Lady Dorothy and Lady Christian). The other major historic house of the hamlet is Pointers (also Poynters), an 18th-century manor house on the hillside overlooking the River Mole; this was the residence of Thomas Page, who purchased both this estate and the manor of Cobham in the year 1781, under the option of his father's will, and substantially enlarged the manor via the Enclosures Act. As the manor house of Cobham it was \\"several times visited here by the late duke of York, and other members of the royal family\\". It has since been divided into multiple dwellings. Also dating from the 1600s is Cold Norton (formerly known as Burchets), a smaller dwelling which retains a well-preserved 17th century barn. Other landmarks Near Hatchford Park are several dwellings which were originally established as almshouses.Ordnance Survey map 1868-1881 On the hill north of Hatchford (known as Chatley Heath, formerly Breach Hill) stands a semaphore tower, which was part of the line of Naval communication semaphore line from the south coast to London, prior to the development of the electric telegraph. Where the M25 motorway cuts through the hamlet is Brickfield copse, named after early brickworks and claypits located there. A Roman villa is known to have existed to the north of Hatchford, near Chatley Farm.

A \\"clean green\\" image cultivated by various sources gives foreign markets the perception of a high degree of food safety for New Zealand produce. Food safety in New Zealand is a concern by the general public and the Government takes measures to regulate it. The estimated cost to the country in 2009 of the six foodborne illnesses campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, norovirus, yersiniosis, STEC and listeriosis was NZ$161 million. The Government launched an annual Foodsafe Week in 2007 to highlight food safety issues. Policy The Food Act 2014 is the primary legislation for governing food safety in New Zealand and is administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries, an amalgamation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Fisheries, and the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (now all defunct). This act supersedes the Food Act 1981 and makes some fundamental changes to New Zealand's domestic food regulatory regime. The new act is primarily designed to drive an export led economic recovery for New Zealand, because the domestic food regulatory regime is the platform for exports. The Food Standards Australia New Zealand develops food standards after consulting with other government agencies and stakeholders. The Minister of Food Safety is Nikki Kaye. Incidents Major food safety incidents are rare but New Zealand was implicated in the 2008 Chinese milk scandal. Fonterra, New Zealand's largest dairy company, had a 43% stake in one of the affected companies. In another recent incident Fonterra found traces of DCD (2-Cyanoguanidine) in milk supplies. The levels were very low and attempts were made to prevent the test results from being reported in the media. Genetic engineering The safety of genetically modified foods and ingredients has often been questioned, particularly since the wide-scale discussion and protests in the early 2000s.

It is about high and is constructed out of precast concrete square tubes. Long considered controversial because of its stark, modernist appearance, there have been several unsuccessful proposals to demolish the fountain over the years. It was the site of a free concert by U2 in 1987, when lead singer Bono spray painted graffiti on the fountain and was both praised and criticized for the action. Location Vaillancourt Fountain, Justin Herman Plaza The fountain is in a highly visible spot on the downtown San Francisco waterfront, in Justin Herman Plaza, where Market Street meets The Embarcadero. The Hyatt Regency Hotel is at the edge of the plaza, adjacent to the other four highrise towers of the Embarcadero Center. Across The Embarcadero is the Ferry Building, and the eastern end of the California Street cable car line is on the other side of the Hyatt Regency Hotel. Vaillancourt Fountain and the Embarcadero Freeway in 1988 When Vaillancourt designed the fountain, the elevated Embarcadero Freeway or Interstate 480, was still in existence along the Embarcadero. The fountain was designed with the freeway environment in mind, but it was built to bring people to an expansive public space, as San Francisco Chronicle architecture critic John King calls it \\"an act of defiant distraction until the freeway came down in 1991\\". Design and construction Vaillancourt Fountain was a product of the redevelopment of San Francisco that took place in the 1950s and 1960s. The Transamerica Pyramid was constructed from 1969-1972 and BART was also being constructed, the Embarcadero Station would eventually open in 1976. Justin Herman, for whom the plaza was named, was a leading figure in this process and the executive director of the redevelopment agency in charge. Modernist landscape architect Lawrence Halprin was selected for the redesign of Market Street from the Embarcadero to the Civic Center, the most visible two mile thoroughfare in San Francisco. Halprin had designed other spaces in the city such as Ghirardelli Square and the United Nations Plaza. He designed Justin Herman Plaza, but hired Armand Vaillancourt to design the fountain. Vaillancourt, 38 years old at the time, had won the invitational fountain design competition that Halprin had judged. Halprin was quoted as saying that if the fountain didn't prove to be among the \\"great works of civic art ... I am going to slit my throat\\". Vaillancourt Fountain, Justin Herman Plaza SF The fountain is about high, weighs approximately , and is constructed out of precast concrete square tubes. The fountain is positioned in a pool shaped like an irregular pentagon, and is designed to pump up to of water per minute. The fountain looks unfinished, like concrete that has not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza \\"like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus. ... breaking open.\\"Thesis by John Grande, Concordia University, September 1997, Armand Vaillancourt's Social Sculpture There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US $310,000. It was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its cost was US $607,800. History Armand Vaillancourt in 2009 Just before the dedication, the slogan \\"Quebec Libre\\" (a reference to the Quebec sovereignty movement) was painted on the fountain at night, and the graffiti was erased. During the dedication, attended by Thomas Hoving, director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, a rock band played, and Armand Vaillancourt himself painted \\"Quebec Libre\\" on the fountain in as many places as he could reach. A redevelopment agency employee started to paint over the slogans during the ceremony, but Herman stopped him, saying it could be done later. When asked about why he defaced his own fountain with graffiti he responded, \\"No, no. It's a joy to make a free statement. This fountain is dedicated to all freedom. Free Quebec! Free East Pakistan! Free Viet Nam! Free the whole world!\\" Vaillancourt said his actions were \\"a powerful performance\\" intended to illustrate the notion of power to the people. \\"Quebec Libre\\" has been an alternate name for the fountain since. Flamin' Groovies performed there, on the 19th September, 1979, and the concert was broadcast on KSAN (FM). 1987 U2 concert U2 lead singer Bono On the first leg of The Joshua Tree Tour by the rock band U2 in 1987, they performed concerts at the Cow Palace just south of San Francisco on April 24 and April 25, 1987. On the third leg of the tour, concerts had been announced for November 14 and 15, 1987, across the San Francisco Bay, at the Oakland Coliseum. On the morning of November 11, 1987, local radio stations announced that U2 would hold a free-admission concert that day in Justin Herman Plaza, with the stage set up in front of the Vaillancourt Fountain. Within a few hours, a crowd estimated at 20,000 people gathered in the plaza. The concert was jokingly called \\"Save the Yuppies\\", in reference to the 1987 stock market crash that had taken place three weeks earlier. The band closed their nine-song performance with their hit \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\". During the instrumental portion in the middle of the song, Bono, lead singer of the band, climbed onto the sculpture and spray painted graffiti on it, reading \\"Rock N Roll Stops The Traffic\\". Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who had been waging a citywide campaign against graffiti that had resulted in over 300 citations during the year, was angry and criticized Bono for defacing a San Francisco landmark. She said, \\"I am disappointed that a rock star who is supposed to be a role model for young people chose to vandalize the work of another artist. The unfortunate incident marred an otherwise wonderful rock concert.\\" Bono was issued a citation for misdemeanor malicious mischief. U2 manager Paul McGuinness said, \\"This is clearly not an act of vandalism. This act was clearly in the spirit of the artwork itself.\\" The numerous callers to Ronn Owens' radio talk show on KGO-AM were evenly split, with younger listeners defending the singer's action and older ones not. Bono soon apologized, saying \\"I really do regret it. It was dumb.\\" The singer explained that he thought that he was honoring the artist's work and that the artist had agreed, but later Bono realized that the city owned the fountain. The group covered the cost of removal of the graffiti. Armand Vaillancourt flew from Quebec to California after the incident, and spoke in favor of Bono's actions at U2's Oakland performance several days later. Vaillancourt said, \\"Good for him. I want to shake his hand. People get excited about such a little thing.\\" The sculptor spray-painted a slogan of his own on the band's stage, \\"Stop the Madness\\". The episode received further attention when it was featured in U2's 1988 documentary film Rattle and Hum. There, footage of it was shown over, and interspersed with, the band's opening number, \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", a song by Bob Dylan that had been a big hit for Jimi Hendrix. This has led some people to misidentify the song being played when the spray painting occurred. In any case, the fountain and plaza ended up on one U2 fan site's list of recommended group-related places in the U.S. to visit. Demolition proposals View of Justin Herman Plaza, Vaillancourt Fountain, and The Embarcadero in 2010 following the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway Following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the elevated Embarcadero Freeway was so badly damaged that it was torn down, and was replaced by a boulevard at ground level. An architect hired by the city also proposed demolition of the fountain, but no decision was made. In 2004, San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin renewed the call to demolish the fountain. The water supply to the fountain had been turned off for several years, because of California's energy crisis of those years. Armand Vaillancourt immediately pledged that he would \\"fight like a devil to preserve that work\\". Debra Lahane, a member of the San Francisco Arts Commission, said that \\"it succeeds as a work of art if it provokes dialogue and discussion. Art that engages the public has had a measure of success.\\" Within a few months, the water was flowing again, and plans to tear down the fountain were abandoned. On and off Vaillancourt Fountain in operation with interior walkway (2011) At the fountain's opening in 1971, both the water flow and human participation were considered integral to the work. Alfred Frankenstein, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, noted \\"the heart of the idea is the unique one of public entry into and intimate exploration of the fountain's innards; in this it is unique and decidedly a success. It is not a great work of sculpture, which is like observing that an automobile is not much of a success as a horse.\\" The water was turned off at the fountain from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US $200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city would pay for the operating costs (at a revised estimate of US $76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US $20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007‚Äì08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008. In reaction to the 2011‚Äì17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason it had not been reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US $500,000. Charles Desmarais, the current art critic of the San Francisco Chronicle echoed Frankenstein's comments from 1971, calling for the water to return in an August 2017 opinion article: On August 15, 2017, water was restored to the fountain as a test run, with the intention that it will stay on until November, when the ice rink reopens. The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue. Vaillancourt Fountain from inside in 2017, with water running again Critical reaction The fountain has been considered controversial since its construction, and criticism of it has continued over the years. Hoving, in his dedication speech, said of the fountain had some of the daring of Baroque sculpture and that \\"A work of art must be born in controversy.\\" Herman himself said it was \\"one of the greatest artistic achievements in North America.\\" Vaillancourt Fountain in operation (2011) At the time of its dedication, the San Francisco chapter of the National Safety Council said that the fountain \\"may be a safety hazard\\". Opponents of the work handed out leaflets at the dedication of the fountain describing it as a \\"loathsome monstrosity\\", a \\"howling obscenity\\", an \\"obscene practical joke\\", \\"idiotic rubble\\", and a \\"pestiferous eyesore\\". Art critic Alfred Frankenstein of the San Francisco Chronicle responded that \\"its very outrageousness and extravagance are part of its challenge\\" and therefore, it \\"can't be all bad.\\" He added that the fountain was intended to be participated in rather than just observed. An early comment by architecture critic Allan Temko, often repeated over the years, describes \\"technological excrescences\\" that had been \\"deposited by a giant concrete dog with square intestines\\". Another pithy remark that gained press attention, from critic Lloyd Skinner, was that the fountain was \\"Stonehenge, unhinged, with plumbing troubles\\". Artists have been critical of the work as well. Sculptor Benny Bufano called it \\"a jumble of nothing\\", artist Willard Cox likened it to \\"dynamited debris\\", and sculptor Humphrey Diaquist said it had been created by \\"a figure of deranged talent\\". Ruth Asawa noted in 1989 that \\"In the attempt to provide a disguise and diversion from the freeway, the goal of the fountain as a work of art was lost.\\" The fountain has been called the \\"least revered modernist work of art\\" in San Francisco. Due to its size, it has been said that it \\"dominates the landscape\\" of the north side of Justin Herman Plaza. It has also been said that the design intent was \\"to mock and mirror the clumsy, double-decked roadway\\", referring to the elevated Embarcadero Freeway which separated the fountain from the waterfront at the time of construction. Charles Birnbaum, noted Halprin expert, stated the architect \\"always wanted people to interact with his water features\\" and that Justin Herman Plaza \\"was intended as a total environment, a space animated by people as well as water\\", so the fountain was designed to attract the public to an area otherwise cut off from the waterfront by the Embarcadero Freeway.

Formed in 1925 near Stalingrad, the division was garrisoned in the city until 1940, when it was transferred to Yerevan to strengthen the Iranian and Turkish borders. The 31st remained there until October, when it was sent north to the Black Sea coast and fought in the Battle of Rostov. During Case Blue in mid-1942 the division retreated south into the Caucasus, then advanced north beginning at the end of the war when the German retreat from the region began. In the northern hemisphere spring of 1943 it was relocated north, fighting in the Battle of the Dnieper late that year. It fought in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive in the summer of 1944 and advanced into Romania before being transferred to Poland and fighting in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive in early 1945. It fought in the Berlin Offensive and was disbanded postwar in western Ukraine in mid-1946.  History   Interwar period  The division was formed in the area of the villages of Kalach, Prutboy, Kalitva, Nizhny Charskaya, and Verkhne Charskaya from the 93rd Red Banner Rifle Regiment near Stalingrad, part of the Volga Military District, on 2 October 1925. On 29 April 1927 it received the honorific \\"Stalingrad\\" after moving to the city. In that year the 31st included the 91st Astrakhan, 92nd Leningrad, and 93rd Don Rifle Regiments. The 31st remained part of the district until January 1940, when it was relocated to Yerevan and became part of the Transcaucasian Military District. It was also stationed near Gusar, Khachmas, and Quba. The division's main body, excluding the headquarters, moved to the Iranian and Turkish borders in April, engaging in strengthening the border defenses by building roads and fortifications.  World War II  The division began World War II in the district's 40th Rifle Corps alongside the 9th Rifle Division. It included the 75th, 177th, and the 248th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 32nd Light Artillery Regiment and the 104th Sapper Battalion. In July it became part of the newly formed 45th Army, covering the Turkish border. After the Red Army suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Kiev and in the Donbass, the 31st was one of the divisions sent north to fill the gap. By 12 October, it was at Taganrog on the coast of the Black Sea, assigned to the Taganrog Group, which became part of the 56th Army in November. With the army, the division fought in the Battle of Rostov and on the Mius during the winter of 1941‚Äì1942. When Case Blue, the German summer offensive of 1942, began, the army and the division retreated into the Caucasus. In July it was transferred to the 12th Army and in August to the North Caucasian Front's 18th Army. The 31st suffered heavy losses in the defense of Tuapse, and on 29 August it was reinforced by the 818th Rifle Regiment, formed from the remnants of the 9th NKVD Motorized Division, which replaced the disbanded 177th Regiment. At the end of the year, when the German retreat from the Caucasus began after their defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, the division was transferred to the 46th Army, advancing north along the Black Sea coast. Soviet troops on the march in Romania Between March and May 1943, the 46th Army and the 31st Division were moved north in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK), joining the Southwestern Front. The division remained with the army in the front, which became the 3rd Ukrainian Front on 20 October, until the end of 1943. During the Battle of the Dnieper, the division was transferred to the 2nd Ukrainian Front's 4th Guards Army. It advanced into Romania in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive with the front during July and August 1944, mostly part of the 4th Guards Army. In September, the division was withdrawn to the RVGK with the 52nd Army's 78th Rifle Corps. The division went back into combat in October with the corps and army, part of the 1st Ukrainian Front. From January 1945, it fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive. In February, the 32nd Artillery Regiment was equipped with twenty 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3) and twelve 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30), practically full strength by the 1942‚Äì1943 tables of equipment and organization, but the regiment's vehicle park was very diverse, incorporating 29 Lend-Lease Studebaker US6 2¬Ω-ton 6x6 trucks, a 1¬Ω-ton Lend-Lease Chevrolet G506 truck, five Soviet-made trucks, four captured German trucks, and six Soviet tractors. Towards the end of the war, despite a chronic shortage of riflemen, the division's artillery remained at full strength. The division fought in the Berlin Offensive in April. From 6 to 11 May, the 31st fought in the Prague Offensive, during which the army advanced south into Czechoslovakia from Bunzlau, reaching the Labe River northeast of Prague by the end of the operation. During the war, it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of Suvorov 2nd class, and the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky 2nd class.  Postwar  The division and its corps were relocated to Poland with the 52nd Army in the area of Kielce, Czƒôstochowa, and Krak√≥w in June. It became part of the Northern Group of Forces there. In the fall of 1945, the army and the 31st Division with the corps were relocated to the Slavuta in the Lvov Military District in western Ukraine.

Initially, they were $1,000 one-year scholarships, renewable for a second year, and sometimes beyond. Multiple awards were given in painting, along with one in sculpture and one in architecture. Awards in illustration were added later. Cresson European Scholarships of $5000 for summer travel, were also awarded annually. These were not as prestigious as the two-year scholarships, with which they are often confused.

Background Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was the son of Privy Iver Rosenkrantz (1674‚Äì1745) and Charlotte Amalie Skeel (1700-63). Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz became a varlet de chambre (kammerjunker) in 1741 and a chamberlain in 1748. In 1749, he was appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Denmark, a position he held until 1771. Likewise, he was released from the court in 1749 when he was appointed into envoy√© extraordinaire for the Prussian court and in 1751 by the English court. In 1760 he was appointed as a Knight of the Dannebrog. Early career In 1763, Rosenkrantz's career received a tremendous boost; the king appointed him to the war secretary of the navy, as well as the first Director in the newly created road building system (vejbygningsv√¶sen). He also admitted into the Ordre de l'Union Parfaite. In 1764, he received the title of Privy Councillor and in 1765 began working for the General Trading Company (Det almindelige Handelskompagni). In January 1766, he became the war secretary of State Government service. But Rosenkrantz's predecessor as head of the fleet, Count Frederik Danneskiold-Sams√∏e (1703‚Äì1778) complained to Christian VII that the fleet was not being run properly. The king responded by dismissing Rosenkrantz from all his important government positions. In 1767, he was appointed to the privy council (konseillet) and a member of the government's inner circle. Finally, he became part of the Order of the Elephant in 1769. Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz retired when he was 46 years old, but was associated with people who would attempt to overthrow the Struensee government, the result was that he was relieved of his ministerial pension. It was disastrous for him as he had accumulated a huge debt of 140,000 dollars. Prime Minister For the next 13 years Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz lived privately on his estates. He occasionally worked at the court but had no official office. In 1784, Crown Prince Frederik conducted his coup and deposed Hoegh-Guldberg government. The circle around the crown prince chose to take some experienced men in the government, including Frederick Christian Rosenkrantz. He was re-appointed as prime minister and president of the Admiralty and Commissioner to Council (kommissariatskollegiet). He was considered an experienced administrator and could bring the government a continuity to the time before Johann Friedrich Struensee (1737-1772). He remained in this office until June 1788. Family life On 11 October 1748 he was married to Dorte Reedtz (1730-1801) in the Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke). She was the daughter of Chamberlain Tonne Reedtz of Barritskov Manor (1700‚Äì1743). They had 3 sons who were born between 1749-1762. While the last two died shortly after birth, the oldest Iver Rosenkrantz-Levetzau (1749-1787) lived until age 38. Legacy Rosenholm Castle Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz was the Rosenkrantz family's most prominent man since the 1600s. From his parents he inherited the Stamford House, Rosenholm Castle in Jutland and the North Zealand manor houses Egholm, Ryegaard and Krabbesholm. In addition, he bought Trudsholm and his wife inherited Barritskov in Jutland.

Weiner was one of five public high schools in Poinsett County and one of two high schools in the Harrisburg School District. It closed in 2013. History Prior to July 1, 2010, it served as the sole high school of the former Weiner School District; on that day it was annexed into Harrisburg School District.\\"Consolidation/Annexations of LEA's (1983-June 30, 2012).\\" Arkansas Department of Education. Retrieved on July 31, 2017. In a four year period from 2010 to 2013 the Weiner High population declined by 37 students, about 22% of the previous enrollment. Weiner High School closed in 2013, after the Harrisburg school board voted 4-1 for closure. Because the Harrisburg board vote was not unanimous, the Arkansas Board of Education was required to approve the closure. The ABE upheld the closure 5-2. Danny Sample, the superintendent of the Harrisburg district, cited the possibility of more academic and extracurricular programs at Harrisburg High School and the declining population of Weiner High as reasons for closure. The school district also hoped that by closing the school, additional funds would be available. The University of Arkansas Office of Educational Policy (OEP) noted that Weiner High School had higher test scores than Harrisburg Middle and High Schools, but that Weiner had fewer students on free and reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty, compared to Harrisburg High. KAIT reported that Weiner residents were unhappy with the prospect of the school's closure. A member of the Arkansas House of Representatives, Randy Alexander, filed House Bill 1938 to prevent any attempts of the ADE, during the period January 2013 to April 2015, from \\"[reorganizing] a school district or a school campus\\" to prevent the closure of Weiner High; the bill was written in hopes that the Arkansas Legislature would consider a study done by the OEP before making the final decision on the closure of Weiner High. In 2015 State Bill 1037 was submitted in an attempt to create a replacement for Weiner High, an agricultural K-12 public school that does not need to fit the state enrollment requirements. Weiner area students now attend Harrisburg High. Demographics Circa 2013 about 49% of Weiner High students received free or reduced lunches.  Curriculum  The assumed course of study for this Title I school follows the Smart Core curriculum developed by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE), which requires students to complete at least 22 units to graduate. Students complete regular (core and career focus) courses and exams and may select Advanced Placement coursework and exams that provide an opportunity for college credit. The school is accredited by the ADE and has been accredited by AdvancED (formerly North Central Association) since 1966. Academic performance For the 2011-2012 school year, 89% of the grade 7-8 students at Weiner High ranked proficient or advanced in the Arkansas state benchmark literacy examinations, and 81% of the grade 7-8 students at Weiner High ranked proficient or advanced in the state benchmark mathematics examinations. For the 2011-2012 school year, Weiner High School had higher high school level (grades 9-12) end of course examination scores in three of four subjects in most levels, except for grade 11, compared to Harrisburg High School; Weiner High's Grade 11 literacy scores were against that pattern. As part of the University of Arkansas Office of Educational Policy (OEP) awards, Weiner High won the Top 25 Middle School and Top 5 Northeast Arkansas awards for literacy performance and the Top 10 High School due to specifically the literacy performance in the 7th grade.  Extracurricular activities  The Weiner High School mascot and athletic emblem is the Cardinal with cardinal red and white serving as its school colors.  Athletics  For 2012-14, the Weiner Cardinals compete in the 1A 3 East Conference under the administration of the Arkansas Activities Association. The Cardinals participate in a variety of Interscholastic activities including golf (boys/girls), bowling (boys/girls), basketball (boys/girls), cheer, baseball, softball, tennis (boys/girls) and track (boys/girls). * Basketball: The boys basketball team won a state basketball championship in 2003 with a 39-7 record.  Clubs and traditions  Weiner students may participate in a variety of clubs and organizations that offer competitions, community service and networking opportunities. Organizations include Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), FFA, FCCLA, Student Council, and Yearbook.

Devine selected a site on Whitehorse Creek southeast of Steens Mountain for his ranch headquarters.McArthur, Lewis A. and McArthur, Lewis L., \\"Whitehorse Ranch\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press; Portland, Oregon, December 2003, pp. 1032‚Äì1033.Wheat, Dan, \\"Ranch Founded on Site of Cavalry Post\\", Capital Press Agriculture Weekly, Salem, Oregon, 7 June 2012.LaLande, Jeff, \\"Settling Up the Country: Founding a Cattle Kingdom, 1870s-1880s\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 2005.Boyd, Bob, \\"Buckaroos\\", The Oregon Encyclopedia, Portland State University, 2013. The location was near Camp C. F. Smith, which had been established by the United States Army in 1866 (the camp was abandoned in 1869). According to Oregon Geographic Names, a post office was established at this location in 1867 with W. A. Mix as the first postmaster. Mix was among a group of soldiers moving through the area in an effort to relocate Camp Alvord. The post office was called White Horse. The land then was part of Baker County from which Harney County was carved in 1889. When Devine took up residence at the ranch, he became the first permanent settler in what is now Harney County, Oregon. Devine became a powerful cattle baron, known for his aristocratic manner. He often dressed in the flamboyant Spanish grandee style including silver-studded leather riding gear. He usually rode a white horse as a symbol of the Whitehorse Ranch. Devine enjoyed horse and greyhound racing, breeding some of his race horses at the ranch. He also supplied horses to the Chico‚ÄìSilver City stage line. Devine built a large stone and timber barn for his horses. The barn was capped by cupola with a white horse weather vane.Jackman, E. R. and John Scharff, \\"Harney County\\", Steens Mountain in Oregon's High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1967, p. 2. Todhunter and Devine cattle grazed widely across the Alvord Basin and into upper Owyhee country until the harsh winter of 1887 killed most of the herd. In 1889, the Whitehorse Ranch was sold to Henry Miller and Charles Lux. At the time, Miller and Lux was the largest cattle operation in the United States. The Whitehorse Ranch was purchased by Paul Stewart in 1945. He drilled new wells on the property to supplement unreliable surface irrigation. He also expanded wild hay fields and planted alfalfa and corn on ranch property. Los Angeles coin dealer, Roy E. \\"Ted\\" Naftzger acquired the ranch in 1961. Naftzger purchased addition land and built the private Whitehorse Ranch Airport at the ranch. In 1988, the Whitehorse Ranch joined the Bureau of Land Management, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Environmental Council, Oregon Cattlemen's Association, Oregon Trout, and the Izaak Walton League to found the Trout Creek Mountain Working Group. The group's goal was to review, discuss and resolve land use conflicts in the Trout Creek Mountains area of southeast Oregon. In 1989, the Whitehorse Ranch voluntarily removed its livestock from of its Whitehorse Butte grazing allotment and two other mountain pastures for a period of three years to prevent over grazing and allow watershed and riparian areas to recover from past grazing. The Trout Creek Mountain Working Group finally agreed on a long-term environmental sustainment plan in 1992. As part of that agreement, the Whitehorse Ranch agreed to reduce the number of its cattle that grazed on public lands from 3,500 to 800.\\"About the Trout Creek Mountain Working Group\\", The Aurora Project, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Prineville, Oregon, 15 April 2000.Wheat, Dan, \\"Healing Rangeland Leaves Grazing Scars\\", Capital Press Agriculture Weekly, Salem, Oregon, 28 June 2012. In 2006, Naftzger sold the ranch to David Herman, a Portland farm equipment dealer and attorney. During the period he owned the ranch, Herman welcomed paying guests who stayed in the ranch's bunkhouse and guest cottages. In 2012, Herman sold the ranch to the BTAZ Nevada cattle company for $10.8 million. Shortly after BTAZ Nevada bought the ranch, the Long Draw Fire burned some of the ranch's grazing allotment in the Trout Creek Mountains.Wheat, Dan, \\"'Rawhide Country' thrives on cattle, history\\", Capital Press Agriculture Weekly, Salem, Oregon, 8 June 2012.Wheat, Dan, \\"Wildfires threaten ranches' future\\", Capital Press Agriculture Weekly, Salem, Oregon, 11 October 2012.  Ranch operation  The Whitehorse Ranch has been continuously operated as a cattle ranch since 1869. Today, it includes of deeded property. The ranch also has Bureau of Land Management grazing allotments that allow its livestock to graze on of public range land. When the deeded property and the grazing allotments are combined the ranch stretches north to south and east to west. Whitehorse Ranch meadow with historic barn beyond The ranch has of gravel and dirt roads, of fence, and 12 livestock wells. There are seven irrigation wells with of irrigation canals and ditches to deliver water to the fields. In addition, the ranch has primary and secondary water rights in several watersheds. The ranch also has one domestic well that provides potable water for ranch houses and other facilities. The ranch has a private air field with two runways. The main runway is long and wide.\\"Whitehorse Ranch\\", National Flight Data Center, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C., 7 April 2013. Prior to the Trout Creek Mountain Working Group agreement in 1992, the Whitehorse Ranch kept approximately 3,500 head of cattle on its range lands. Today, the number of cattle has been reduced to 800. The ranch also keeps approximately 50 horses for use on the ranch. The ranch has a small permanent crew; however, additional people are often hired to help with herding, branding, and hay harvesting. The ranch is so large that moving livestock from one pasture to another often takes several days. During these movements, ranch hands herd cattle from dawn to sundown through rugged Oregon High Desert. The ranch's remote location creates some unique challenges. For example, the ranch uses approximately of fuel per year. Since there are no local fuel stations, the ranch buys fuel from a wholesale distributor in Eugene and trucks it to the ranch once a year. To conserve fuel, ranch hands use small vehicles to check fences and irrigation ditches. The remoteness of the ranch also requires ranch hands to do most equipment repairs on site. The Whitehorse Ranch is an official weather station. It reports weather data to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center daily.\\"1981-2010 Normals Data Access\\", National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, North Carolina, 7 April 2013.  Ranch environment  The native vegetation on the Whitehorse Ranch is dominated by large sagebrush and desert grasses. Other common shrubs include bitterbrush, snowberry, and ceanothus. Patches of mountain mahogany are also found in the area. Common grass species include Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, western needlegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail plus basin wildrye in some well-drained areas.\\"Description of Existing Environment\\" (PDF), Trout Creek Geographic Management Area ‚Äì Standards of Rangeland Health Evaluation, Vale District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Vale, Oregon, August 2006. The ranch supports a wide variety of wildlife including cougar, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, and jackrabbits. Bird species native to the area include sage grouse, mountain chickadees, gray-headed juncos, black-throated gray warbler, Virginia's warbler, MacGillivray's warbler, pine siskin, red crossbill, bushtit, hermit thrush, and northern goshawks, ravens, and eagles.\\"Oregon Canyon and Trout Creek Mountain Woodlands\\", Audubon Society of Portland, Portland, Oregon, 23 April 2009. Creeks on the Whitehorse Ranch are home to Lahontan cutthroat trout. To preserve the riparian ecosystem, the ranch keeps cattle away from creek banks during critical times of the year.  Location  Whitehorse Ranch Road east of Fields, Oregon The Whitehorse Ranch is in extremely remote area of southeastern Oregon. It is southeast of Steens Mountain and the Alvord Desert and north of the Trout Creek Mountains. The ranch headquarters is along Whitehorse Creek in the southeast corner of Harney County. However, the ranch also includes property in Malheur County. The base elevation of the ranch is above sea level.

Life He was born at Acton Hill, Middlesex, the son of William Adams, a tailor, and Helen Elizabeth Humphreys. Two sons and three daughters survived the father. The second daughter, Clarissa, engaged in art and exhibited at the Royal Academy. To avoid confusion with other artists of the same name, Adams adopted in 1869 the additional surname of Acton from his birthplace. He was educated at Lady Byron's school, Ealing, and received his first tuition as a sculptor under Timothy Butler. He subsequently worked in the studio of Matthew Noble, and during 1853‚Äì8 studied at the Royal Academy Schools, where his promise was liberally recognised. He won first medals in the antique and life classes, and the gold medal for an original sculpture group, Eve supplicating forgiveness at the feet of Adam, in December 1855. As a student he exhibited a medallion of Dr. Chalton in 1854, and other medallions in 1855 and 1856. In 1858, he gained the Academy's travelling studentship, and was at Rome till 1865. There his success in portraiture, to which he devoted his main efforts, excited the admiration of John Gibson, who sent many visitors to his studio. Works After 1865, Acton settled in London, where he was soon busily employed. He executed the Wesley memorial in Westminster Abbey, the Cruikshank memorial in St Paul's Cathedral, the statue of Wesley in the forecourt of Wesley's Chapel, and the memorial of Cardinal Manning in the newly built Westminster Cathedral. He also executed a colossal statue of Sir Titus Salt, erected near Bradford Town Hall in 1874, and statues of Queen Victoria for Kingston and the Bahamas, of William Ewart Gladstone, a close friend and the godfather of his fourth son, for Blackburn and Liverpool, and of Bishop Samuel Waldegrave for Carlisle Cathedral. Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, sat to him many times, and the Emperor and Empress of Germany showed interest in his art. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy till 1892, sending there statues or busts of Gladstone (1865, 1868, 1869, 1873, 1879), Lord Brougham (1867, 1868), John Bright (1870), Charles Dickens (1871), Charles Spurgeon (1874), Earl Russell (1874), Archbishop Manning (1884), Benjamin Disraeli (1885), and Pope Leo XIII (1888). Others who sat to him were Canon Noel Duckworth, the Earl of Shaftesbury, Dr. Parker, Henry Fawcett, Lord Napier of Magdala, Richard Cobden, Lord Roberts, Dean Frederic Farrar, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, Sir Isaac Holden, Sir Edwin Landseer and many leading academicians. Of his ideal work the best were The First Sacrifice, The Lady of the Lake, Pharaoh's Daughter, Zenobia, and The Millennium. Acton's last work, which was left unfinished, was a small figure of The Angel of Peace. He died at his wife's home Ormidale, Brodick, in the Isle of Arran which he visited every summer, on 28 October 1910. Family Acton married on 15 August 1875, at St. Mark's Church, Hamilton Terrace, London, author Marion Hamilton of the Isle of Arran. They had four sons and three daughters. Two of his sons, Harold and Murray, practised their father's art.

History In 1918, the Jiangsu Provincial Ceramics Factory was established for the production of pottery using Yixing clay. By 1932, more than 600 craftspeople worked in Yixing. During the Japanese invasion, the artists scattered and many subsequently died. Under the People's Republic of China government, industry began to revive.'Yixing Pottery: The World of Chinese Tea Culture' By Chunfang Pan, page 20 In 1954, 59 potters began the Zisha production group of the Shushan workshop with funding from the Tangdu Pottery co-operative. The government established Factory No. 1 in April 1958. Before that time, no proper ranking existed for the craftsmen. Every maker mined, mixed and took courses and exams to be recognised. It took about three years of training to advance through the system. At each stage the craftsmen were required to complete a test to attain a new title. The craftsmen would begin as an 'Assistant Master Craftsman', then ascend through the ranks of 'Master Craftsman', 'Senior Master Craftsman' and finally 'National Master Craftsman'. Their signature product was artisan-crafted teapots. Starting in 1966, the Cultural Revolution led Factory No. 1 to begin to produce utilitarian pots in a style known as shui ping hu in vast numbers. Instead of having the name of the craftsman who made the pot on the bottom, these pots had characters that represented Yixing. During this time, the factory walls were filled with slogans painted in red that insisted that art was for the people and not for self-aggrandizement. According to Barbara Oakley, the quality of these pots was far worse than before the revolution. Despite this, many connoisseurs still prize these pots for their simplicity and quality. With the end of the Cultural Revolution, new ranks for craftsmen were subsequently introduced in the 1970s: * Technician (Xing-siu) * Craftsman (Jishuyuan or Gongyi meishuyuan) * Craftsman (Minjian yiren) ‚Äì independent potters * Assistant Master craftsman (Zhuli gongyishi) * Master craftsman (Gongyishi) * Senior Master craftsman (Gaoji gongyishi) * Provincial Grandmaster * Grandmaster craftsman. Today, teapots produced by the factory are diverse and creative; masters have resumed signing their work and their creations are in high demand. Waits for a master craftsman's commissioned pot can reach up to two years. Notable artists Gu Jingzhou, one of the founders and Deputy Director of Research and Technology at the factory, was an accomplished master artist. His teapots have sold for up to $US 2 million. Jiang Rong was a Grand Master. Her teapots emulated nature. Ren Ganting (1889-1968), an ambidextrous artist who created natural forms, participated in the National Labour Heroes Convention. Pei Shimin (1892-1979) started making teapots at age 14. Zhu Kexin (1904-1986) began making teapots before the war and worked in the Jiangsu factory as a youth. He has since received many honours. Other factories Yixing Factory No. 2 was formed in 1984 by brothers Xu Siew Tang and Xu Han Tang, both master craftsmen. They managed to lure some craftsmen and women from Factory No. 1 to join them.

However, the term is also being used online for a special form of false pregnancy (pseudocyesis), or delusion of pregnancy, or phantom pregnancy, in which a person who has no medical verification of pregnancy, including biologically male individuals, believes that they are pregnant, sometimes for years.  Medically cryptic pregnancies  The television series I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant shared the stories of women who had experienced medically cryptic pregnancies. They didn't realize they were pregnant until they were in labor or had given birth. Nearly all the featured stories involved women who continued to have their period as usual throughout their pregnancy, while some cited not having regular periods due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), or other conditions that are associated with infertility. The women involved often did not gain weight, or experience the \\"symptoms\\" of pregnancy such as weight gain, morning sickness, or tender breasts. Those who did experience some symptoms of pregnancy either claimed to attribute the symptoms to an existing condition, claimed to have taken a home pregnancy test and gotten a negative result, or both. A few of the stories involved women who had known they were pregnant and experienced an early miscarriage, only to realize they were still pregnant when the baby was being born. It is common that after the birth the new parent looks back and realizes that there were some signs of pregnancy they had ignored. For women who have had a typical pregnancy, the assumption is that there is no way to not \\"feel\\" a pregnancy. However, obstetricians on the show explained that, depending on the position of the placenta, the sensations of a baby moving can be minimal. In 2015, the show's spin off, \\"I Still Didn't Know I Was Pregnant\\", featured women who had experienced multiple medically cryptic pregnancies.  Causes  The causes of medically cryptic pregnancies are either physiological, that is, there were no recognizable symptoms of pregnancy, or can be due to psychological problems. For example, denied pregnancy is a condition in which a woman is mentally unable to accept that she is pregnant and so may go part way or all the way through a pregnancy unconscious of her pregnancy. In some cases, that is linked to bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. However, denied pregnancy is rare, Web MD cites that 1:400-500 pregnant women get to the fifth month of pregnancy before realizing they're pregnant and only 1:2,500 will go all the way to labor.  Consequences  The major concern with medical cryptic pregnancies is a lack of prenatal care. This may result in harm to both developing fetus and the pregnant woman. A cryptic pregnancy does not allow the woman who is pregnant to prepare emotionally for parenthood, nor to decide if they want to be, or are ready to be, a parent. This could lead to in increased risk of child neglect or abuse.  In history  Pope Joan, a character from 14th century European literature, is said to have been a pope during the 9th century in the guise of a man, until she went into labor while on procession. Though modern scholars consider her to be a fictional character, it shows a recognition of medically cryptic pregnancies in the European Middle Ages. = Cryptic pregnancy as a delusion of pregnancy = The Gilmour Foundation (\\"the experts on cryptic pregnancy\\") has claimed that a cryptic pregnancy is one that is missed by pregnancy tests and ultrasounds because, in a cryptic pregnancy, the fetus develops much more slowly than normal, sometimes gestating for years, and not always in the uterus. The foundation has said that this causes the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone to be too low to be detected by medical tests and, because the pregnancy is smaller or located outside the uterus, it is missed on ultrasounds. However, there is no medical literature to support the existence of cryptic pregnancy as described by the Gilmour Foundation. Rather, this type of \\"cryptic pregnancy\\" should be understood as a form of mental illness.  Causes  For the most part, this form of cryptic pregnancy is a psychological issue, a form of mental illness related to a woman who really wants to be pregnant causing her to believe that she is, regardless of what medical professionals tell her and what test results show. Some people with this mental illness show symptoms of pregnancy, such as amenorrhea, weight gain, nausea, etc., which could be caused by the delusion or by its underlying cause.  Dr. Phil Show  Dr. Phil featured women on his talk show who believed they had been pregnant for years with a cryptic pregnancy. Despite negative urine and blood tests, and medical imaging of their abdomens showing no pregnancy, the women persisted in their belief they were pregnant, including one who had had a tubal ligation in her early 20's. Dr. Thais Aliabadi was the expert guest on the show and explained that many women claim to have a cryptic pregnancy to explain physical symptoms they associate with pregnancy, such as weight gain in the abdomen, mood swings, sore breasts and food cravings.  In history  Queen Mary I of England is rumored to have experienced false pregnancy, which may be considered cryptic, because she continued to believe she was pregnant past the expected due month. However, because of the limitations of medical technology, and the delicacy of inspecting the body of the queen, doctors would have had great difficulty in verifying a pregnancy, including whether it was a tumor or a molar pregnancy. During one of her false pregnancies, Mary believed herself to be pregnant for nearly a year after her period stopped, when suddenly her abdomen flattened without her going into labor. = See also = * False Pregnancy * I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant = References = Category:Pathology of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium Category:Pregnancy-themed television shows Category:Delusional disorders Category:Pregnancy-themed television episodes Category:Motherhood ","title":"Cryptic pregnancy"},{"id":"39095970","text":"Bovard may refer to: *Bovard, Butler County, Pennsylvania *Bovard, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community in Westmoreland County *Bovard Field, a stadium in Los Angeles, California People with the name Bovard *Alan Bovard *George F.

It is located on the coast of Liverpool Bay, at the mouth of the Afon Dulas, west of Abergele, east of Colwyn Bay and east of Conwy. As the name suggests, it consists of the villages of Llanddulas and Rhyd-y-foel. At the 2001 census the community had a population of 1,572, reducing slightly to 1,542 at the 2011 census. Now derelict, Gwrych Castle stands on the hillside to the east of Llanddulas. Built between 1812 and 1822 by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh, it has been described as a \\"spectacular and romantic flight of gothic fancy,\\" and was an attempt to create a replica of an Edwardian fortress. The castle contains 18 towers, and is surrounded by terraced gardens and woodland, with gothic park walling, lodges and towers. The total frontage is over in length, and has been described as \\"one of the finest examples of its date in Britain\\" by Cadw. It is Grade I listed. In November 2011, planning permission was granted to convert the building into a hotel, conference centre and spa. Saint Cynbryd's Church, in Llanddulas, dates from 1868, and was designed by George Edmund Street, who was also responsible for the Royal Courts of Justice in London. It is on the site of an earlier medieval church which had been rebuilt in 1732, and was commissioned by Robert Bamford-Hesketh of Gwrych Castle. It is described by Cadw as being \\"of subtle sophistication and quiet mastery\\" and is Grade II* listed. Similarly listed is Plas Tan-yr- ogof, a farmhouse on the Gwrych estate, built in 1819, which was used for a while as a night club. In 2008, a long honeycomb worm reef was discovered on the beach at Llanddulas,by fishery officer Philip Capper of the North Western and North Wales sea fisheries committee after an absence of 60 years. The worms are common to the Mediterranean Sea, and are rare in the British Isles, but found at a number of sites on western and southern coasts. They create the reefs by forming tightly packed tubes from sand and shell particles on top of rocky shores, which then provide a haven for barnacles, crabs, limpets, mussels, periwinkles, sea anemones and whelks. Pen-y-corddyn-mawr is a hillfort located on a limestone plateau above Rhyd-y-foel, where Roman artefacts have been unearthed. Lead mines nearby are thought to have been worked by the Romans, and were still in use in the 1820s, when they provided the lead for Gwrych Castle's windows. The limestone hill of Cefn yr Ogof 204 metres (669 feet)stands above the village. Nearby is the crag of Craig y Forwyn.

Despite the subject, the work incorporates more devotional scripture than actual topographical description. He also wrote a book of sermons, Postilla catechetica, in eight volumes including nearly 9,000 pages. Sermons Catechetica is a commentary on Luther's Small Catechism. In order publish these works, he established the first printing-house in Norway. At his request, Tyge Nielss√∏n moved from Copenhagen to Christiania in 1643 to serve as printer. This historic initial Norwegian printing press lasted only one year, but in 1646 Berg established a branch of the Melchior Marzan printing- house from Copenhagen in Christiania. In total, Bang will spend over 7000 Norwegian speciedaler in the printing of books.Bull, Francis: Norges litteraturhistorie, bd. 2. Oslo: Gyldendal, 1958. Bang's press is also noted for printing the Aggerhus-Acter which provided independent accounts of the ongoing Gyldenl√∏ve War with Sweden.East Norway and its Frontier by Frank Noel Stagg, George Allen & Unwin, Ltd., 1956.

Ghajar, and Mehmet Kanoglu. Heat and Mass Transfer Fundamentals and Applications. New York: McGraw Hill Higher Education, 2011. Print. It may lead to phenomena such as houses feeling cooler in the winter and warmer in the summer at the same temperature. For example, in a room in which air temperature is maintained at 22¬∞ Celsius at all times, but in which the inner surfaces of the house is estimated to be an average temperature of 10¬∞ Celsius in the winter or 25¬∞ Celsius in the summer, heat transfer from the surfaces to the individual will occur, resulting in a difference in the perceived temperature. We can observe and compare the rate of radiation heat transfer between a person and the surrounding surfaces if we first make a few simplifying assumptions: * The heat exchange in the environment is in a ‚Äústeady state‚Äù, meaning that there is a constant flow of heat either into or out of the house. * The person is completely surrounded by the interior surfaces of the room. * Heat transfer by convection is not considered. * The walls, ceiling, and floor are all at the same temperature. For an average person, the outer surface area is 1.4 m¬≤, the surface temperature is 30¬∞C, and the emissivity (Œµ) is 0.95. Emissivity is the ability of a surface to emit radiative energy compared to that of a black body at the same temperature.\\"Emissivity: Definition and Influence in Non-contact Temperature Measurement.\\" / 13.04.2013. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013. We will be using the following equation to find out how much heat is lost by a person standing in the same room in summertime as compared to the winter, at exactly the same thermostat reading temperature: :\\\\dot{Q}=\\\\varepsilon\\\\sigma A_s (T_s^4 - T_{surr}^4) Where \\\\dot{Q} is the rate of heat loss (W), \\\\varepsilon is the emissivity (or the ability of an objects surface to emit energy by radiation) of a person, \\\\sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\\\\sigma=5.670373 \\\\times 10^{-8}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{W\\\\, m^{-2}K^{-4}}), A_s is the surface area of a person, T_s is the surface temperature of a person (K), and T_{surr} is the surface temperature of the walls, ceiling, and floor (K). Please note that this equation is only valid for an object standing in a completely enclosed room, box, etc. In the winter, the amount of heat loss from a person is then 152 Watts if the inner surfaces of the room is, for example, 10 degrees Celsius. :\\\\dot{Q}=0.95 \\\\times 5.670373 \\\\times 10^{-8} \\\\times 1.4 \\\\times ((30+273.15)^4 - (10+273.15)^4) = 152.17 In the summer, the amount of heat loss from a person, when the inner surfaces of the room were 25 degrees Celsius, was found to be 40.9 Watts. :\\\\dot{Q}=0.95 \\\\times 5.670373 \\\\times 10^{-8} \\\\times 1.4 \\\\times ((30+273.15)^4 - (25+273.15)^4) = 40.9 Thermal radiation emitted by all bodies above absolute zero (-273.15¬∞C).Siegel, Robert, and John R.

It differs from other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays, gamma rays, microwaves that are not related to temperature. Therefore, people constantly radiate their body heat, but at different rates depending on body and surrounding temperatures. From these values, the rate of heat loss from a person is almost four times as large in the winter than in the summer, which explains the ‚Äúchill‚Äù we feel in the winter even if the thermostat setting is kept the same.

The fauna of the U.S. State of Nevada is mostly species adapted to desert, temperature extremes and to lack of moisture. With an average annual rainfall of only about , Nevada is the driest ‚Äì and has the largest percentage of its total area classified as desert ‚Äì of all states in the United States.Sessions S. Wheeler: \\"The Nevada Desert\\" (page 19). The Caxton Printers, 1971. Two-thirds of the state is located within the largest desert on the North American continent, the Great Basin Desert, while the lower one-third is the Mojave Desert. The smaller Smoke Creek Desert and Black Rock Desert are located in the northwest, while other deserts include the Y P Desert, Tule Desert, Forty Mile Desert, Owyhee Desert and the Amargosa Desert. Nevada is located within the Nearctic faunistic realm in a region containing an assemblage of species similar to Northern Africa . Animals in Nevada include for instance scorpions, mountain lions, snakes, lizards, spiders, wolves, coyotes, foxes, ground squirrels, rabbits, falcons, ravens, desert tortoise, hawks, eagles, bobcats, sheep, deer, pronghorns, geckos, owls, bats, horned toads and more. Nevada‚Äôs rivers and lakes contain large quantities of bass, trout, crappie, and catfish.  Avifauna  A dark-morph ferruginous hawk on nest. A total of more than 480 species of birds have been recorded in Nevada, and of these, 300 species have either nested or are estimated to occur with regularity in the state. The majority of Nevada‚Äôs breeding birds are landbirds, but a large percentage of the priority species are shorebirds and waterbirds, reflecting the importance of water bodies in the desert. 78 species of Nevadan birds are currently identified as priority species. These birds are subdivided into 70 Conservation priority species, five Stewardship species, and three Special Status species. The 70 Conservation priority species are identified by the fact that they were ranked as high priorities in one or more bird conservation initiatives. Most Conservation priority species were designated as such by regional initiatives because of population declines, significant threats, dependence on restricted or threatened habitats, or small population size. Three species that were not ranked by regional initiatives (northern goshawk, ferruginous hawk, and golden eagle) were included as Conservation priority species based on current concerns in Nevada and agency priorities. Bird species in the state include the American bald eagles, New World vulture, peregrine falcon, northern goshawk, red-tailed hawk, American white pelican, northern phainopepla, great horned owl, burrowing owl, golden eagle, prairie falcon, greater roadrunner, canyon wren, Gambel's quail, house finch, Harris's hawk, common gallinule, curlew sandpiper, common black-hawk, zone-tailed hawk, red crossbill, northern cardinal, red-faced cormorant, sooty grouse, wild turkey, northern harrier, American bittern, red-shouldered hawk, ferruginous hawk, broad-winged hawk, Cooper‚Äôs hawk, elf owl, gyrfalcon, sharp-shinned hawk and many more. The mountain bluebird is the official state bird.  Mammals  More than 250 American black bears currently live on the Nevadan side of Lake Tahoe. More than 61 species of mammals live in Nevada, where most of the land mammals live in the more vegetated areas in northwestern parts of the state. While most of the state has mammals adapted to the dry desert climate, the area around Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake has forests and mammals such as the American black bear, beavers, otters, skunks and raccoons. The desert bighorn sheep is the official state animal and is found in most of Nevada's mountainous desert. The desert bighorn is smaller than the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep but has a wider horn spread. The population of desert bighorn sheep are blooming; while it was 1500 in 1960, the population has increased to almost 5300 by the 1990s. The mountain bighorn sheep can go for extended periods of time without drinking water. With their unique padded hooves, bighorns are able to climb the steep terrain of the Nevadan desert. Desert bighorn sheep also have keen eyesight to detect predators such as bobcats, mountain lions and coyotes. Other mammals in Nevada are the Merriam's shrew, white-tailed antelope squirrel, cactus mouse, gray fox, mustang horse, kit fox, kangaroo rat, mountain cottontail, desert bighorn sheep, pack rat, Townsend's big-eared bat, coyotes, collared peccary, Rocky Mountain goat, pronghorn, wild donkeys, mountain lion, raccoons, Ring-tailed cat, American Grey Fox, American black bear, striped skunk, short-tailed weasel, badger, lynx, Sierra Nevada red fox, grey wolf, western jumping mouse, lodgepole chipmunk, American beaver, Yuma bat, and several others.  Arachnids  The scorpions of Nevada are well represented by four main families: Buthidae, Caraboctonidae, Vaejovidae and the intriguingly named Superstitioniidae. Nevada has 23 species of scorpion, including Centruroides sculpturatus, one of many species referred to as a bark scorpion. Other species of scorpion include the giant desert hairy scorpion, and Hadrurus spadix. Nevada's hot climate makes it an ideal state for certain spiders to live. Spiders include Carolina wolf spider, jumping spider, funnel- weaving spider, crab spider, black widow and tarantula.  Reptiles  The desert tortoise is a native of the Mojave Desert in Southern Nevada. More than 52 registered species of reptiles live in Nevada, where 12 are considered venomous and an additional 6 are considered dangerous. Venomous species of snakes include the sidewinder, western diamondback and Great Basin rattlesnakes. Other species of reptiles include the venomous Gila monster, northern desert horned lizard, sagebrush lizard, leopard lizard, western fence lizard, short-horned lizard and the Nevadan official state reptile: the threatened desert tortoise. The desert tortoise, which can live up to seventy years, is found in southwestern Nevada and is the largest reptile in the southwestern United States. In parts of the state, the population has decreased thirty to fifty percent due to predation, disease, vandalism and illegal collection by humans.  Fish  Nevada has 48 species of fish living in its 600 rivers and more than 200 lakes. Large lakes with several species of fish include for instance Pyramid Lake, Lake Tahoe, Lake Mead, Lake Mohave, Franklin Lake and Walker Lake. At least 12 of Nevada‚Äôs fishes are endemic to Nevada waters ‚Äì they occur here and exist nowhere else in the world. Examples of endemic Nevadan fish are Devil's Hole pupfish in Devils Hole, moapa dace in Muddy River and the Cui-ui in Pyramid Lake and Truckee River. The Lahontan cutthroat trout is the official state fish and a native trout found in 14 of the State‚Äôs 17 counties. Fish species in Nevada include mountain whitefish, Great Basin redband trout, bull trout, Yellowstone cutthroat trout, Bonneville cutthroat trout, Lahontan cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, largemouth bass, Small Mouthed Bass, channel catfish, striped bass, bullhead catfish, crappie, green sunfish, bluegill sunfish, carps, humpback chub, razor back sucker, bonytail chub and Colorado squawfish.  Amphibians  Amphibians in Nevada include the tiger salamander, western toad, Great Basin spadefoot, bullfrog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Woodhouse's toad, Amargosa toad, southwestern toad and several other species of toad, frog and salamander.

Set at Thanksgiving, the episode shows Jeff meeting his father for the first time while other members of the group attend Shirley's Thanksgiving dinner with her family, in a parody of The Shawshank Redemption. The former storyline received mixed critical reception, whilst the latter was mostly criticized. The episode was watched by an estimated 3.29 million viewers upon its premiere. Plot Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) invites the study group to her in-laws' Thanksgiving dinner, but the Dean (Jim Rash) reveals‚Äîhaving read Jeff's (Joel McHale) emails‚Äîthat Jeff will be meeting his father for the first time on Thanksgiving. When Jeff arrives at his father's house, he changes his mind, but he calls Britta (Gillian Jacobs) and learns that she is waiting for him at the house. He is forced to go there and meet his father William (James Brolin) and half-brother Willy Jr. (Adam Devine), the latter of whom is worried that Jeff will replace him. As Britta attempts to console Willy Jr., Jeff and William begin to get along. After William suggests that his abandonment of Jeff had a positive influence on his life, Jeff leaves. As he is driving, he is shocked to find Willy Jr. in his backseat, begging for advice on how to get his father to stop hating him. In answering, Jeff realizes that he cannot achieve closure without confronting his father. He tells William that he is not well-adjusted, recounting an incident in seventh grade in which he pretended to have appendicitis to get sympathy. After a classmate asked to see the scar, he self-inflicted a wound with a pair of scissors and he still keeps the cards he received under his bed. William attempts to fake a heart attack and Jeff leaves. He hugs Willy Jr. and thanks Britta for making him confront his father. Meanwhile, members of the study group arrive for Shirley's dinner and find her in-laws unpleasant. They hide in the garage and plan to escape. Annie (Alison Brie) fakes period pain but the ruse falls through as Shirley's sister-in-law is a gynecologist. The group take it in turns to interact with Shirley's relatives while amusing themselves in the garage. In an attempt to escape, Pierce (Chevy Chase) purposefully trips over a rug and walks into a corner of a table, but the relatives find this hilarious and Pierce is enthused by their positive response. Troy (Donald Glover), Annie and Abed (Danny Pudi) are about to eat expired bean dip to escape the event when Shirley arrives. She admits that she invited them because she dislikes her in-laws, who act rudely towards her. The group then plan a way to allow Shirley to escape the party, but she rejects the idea because of the value she places on family. The group agree to stay with her. Later, Jeff throws the group a surprise Thanksgiving dinner in the study room. In the end tag, Shirley discovers a hole Abed made in her garage and plans to use it next Thanksgiving. Analysis The storyline with members of the group trapped at Shirley's family Thanksgiving party parodies the 1994 prison drama The Shawshank Redemption. Abed narrates the storyline in a style similar to that of the film's narrator Morgan Freeman. Reception Upon its first broadcast in the United States, an estimated 3.29 million viewers watched the episode. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, finding the comedy \\"basically fine\\" and approving of the dramatic moments between Jeff and his dad. However, she disliked Willy Jr.'s character. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 7 out of 10, finding it an improvement over preceding episodes. Goldman found the storyline with Jeff and his dad \\"pretty successful\\", praising Brolin's acting and finding Britta's presence \\"good and funny\\" though \\"odd\\", but criticized the prison parody as \\"half-baked\\" and \\"gratuitous\\". Gabrielle Moss of TV Fanatic rated the episode 3.8 out of 5, praising the acting of McHale and Brolin but finding that Jeff's dad lacked characterization and the episode's message was unclear. Sean Gandert of Paste found that the episode \\"did a good job honoring the complexity\\" of Jeff's relationship to his father, but that the other storyline was a \\"by-the-numbers lame pop culture parody\\". Josh Gondelman of Vulture reviewed the episode negatively, believing it to have improperly dealt with serious character revelations, such as Jeff recounting a childhood infliction of self-harm. Gondelman found the prison parody storyline to use \\"references-as-comedy\\" and fail to \\"capitalize on the setup\\", also criticizing Troy's \\"unironic anxiety\\" over Batman's sexuality as homophobic.

It is preserved in the twelfth-century Codex Gothanus, Forschungsbibliothek 84 at Gotha, from which its conventional Latin titles are derived; The chronicle is not titled in the manuscript. The text is ideologically pro-Carolingian, and among its sources are Isidore of Seville and possibly Jerome.Everett (2003), 93‚Äì94. Date, place and author The Chronicon covers the period from the origins of the Lombards to the campaign of Pippin against Islamic Corsica: \\"Then the island of Corsica, oppressed by the Moors, his army liberated from their rule.\\"Igitur Corsicam insulam a Mauris oppressam suo iussu eiusque exercitus liberavit, quoted in Berto (2010), 28 n. 30. This campaign is also recorded in the Annales regni Francorum, which place it in the year 806.\\"That same year, against the Moors on the island of Corsica‚Äîwhich they had devastated‚ÄîPippin sent a fleet from Italy, the arrival of which the Moors did not expect and retreated\\" (Eodem anno in Corsicam insulam contra Mauros, qui eam vastabant, classis de Italia a Pippino missa est, cuius adventum Mauri non espectantes abscesserunt), quoted in Berto (2010), 28 n. 30. Since the Chronicon also praises Pippin as if he is still living,\\"This present day by his [Pippin's] help Italy shines, as in ancient days. Law, harvests, peace and quiet she has. . .\\" (Praesentem diem per eius adiutorium splenduit Italia, sicut fecit antiquissimis diebus. Leges et ubertates et quietudinem habuit. . .), quoted in Berto (2010), 28 n. 31. it must have been written between the last event it records (806) and his death in 810.Berto (2010), 28. Nothing about the author of the Chronicon Gothanum is known for certain. His pro-Carolingian stance has led some historians, such as Claudio Azzara and Stefano Gasparri, to believe that he was a Frank. Others, such as Stefano Cingolani, Bruno Luiselli and Magali Coumert, believe he was a Lombard, since in one passage he seems to identify with them when he refers to the Lombards during their time in Saxony as \\"our ancient forefathers\\".\\"So after struggling they arrived in the Saxon country, at the place called Patespruna (Paderborn); where our ancient fathers assert they lived a long time\\" (sic deinde certantes Saxoni patria attigerunt, locus ubi Patespruna cognominantur; ubi sicut nostri antiqui patres longo tempore asserunt habitasse), quoted in Berto (2010), 29 n. 33. Another autobiographical detail is sometimes coaxed from the text when the author says that the remains of the residence of king Wacho were still visible in his day.\\"Thus, even to this present day the remains of King Wacho's palace and residence are visible\\" (Unde usque hodie presentem diem Wachoni regi eorum domus et habitatio apparet signa), quoted in Berto (2010), 29 n. 34. Since Wacho was king during the Lombards' stay in Pannonia, and Pippin fought a war with the Avars in that region, it is possible that the author was with Pippin on the expedition and saw the remains of the house for himself. It is equally possible that he was merely reporting what he had heard.Berto (2010), 29 n. 34. The place of writing is also unknown: Coumert believes the author worked in the Abbey of Montecassino, while Walter Pohl hypothesised that it took place in Milan and Luigi Berto agrees that it is probably a north Italian work. Berto also concludes that the author was \\"probably a member of Pippin's court\\".Berto (2010), 48. Dependence on the Origo and Paul the Deacon Azzara and Gasparri, in a recent critical edition of Lombard laws, posit that the Chronicon Gothanum is based in part on the Origo gentis langobardorum, a position supported by the Chronicon's initial editor, Friedrich Bluhme, who placed them side by side in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica.Everett (2003), 93, citing Azzara and Gasparri (eds.), Le leggi dei Longobardi: storia, memoria e diritto di un popolo germanico, Le Fonti 1 (Milan: 1992), 282‚Äì91. If this were the case, it would provide evidence for the circulation of the Origo some 150 years before the earliest surviving tenth-century copy, although the original text of the Origo may have been composed as early as the reign of Perctarit (671‚Äì88). In another critical edition of the Origo, Annalisa Bracciotti hypothesises that a \\"subarchetype\\" of the text tradition of the Chronicon Gothanum circulating in eighth-century Italy was used by Paul the Deacon for his Historia langobardorum.Everett (2003), 94, citing Bracciotti, Origo gentis langobardorum: introduzione, testo critico, commento, Biblioteca di Cultura Romanobarbarica 2 (Rome: 1998), 14. A \\"subarchetype\\" or \\"hyperarchetype\\" is a hypothesised or reconstructed version of a text lying between the original archetype and the final version. Cingolani argues that the Chronicon and the Origo made use of a common (now lost) source.Berto (2010), 28, citing Cingolani, Le storie dei Longobardi: dall'origine a Paolo Diacono (Rome: 1995), 94. Berto says that the Origo and \\"some other unknown texts\\" were the sources used by the author of the Chronicon. Nicholas Everett believes that rather than drawing on the Origo or some earlier \\"Ur-Origo\\", the Chronicon Gothanum could have borrowed just as easily from Paul the Deacon, a theory also suggested by Walter Goffart.Goffart (1988), 382 n. 163. The Chronicon does not contain the story of Woden and Frea that the Origo does, and it borrows text verbatim from Isidore explaining the original name of the Lombards (Winili) as derived from a river Vindilicus on the edges of Gaul and describing them as \\"prone to long beards and never shorn\\" (ad barba prolixa et numquam tonsa). Among the stories that may have been borrowed from Paul, the Chronicon blames the Romans' weakness in the face of the Lombard invasion of Italy on a pestilence that occurred during the time of Narses,Goffart (1988), 390 n. 191. and the legendary Germanic hero Walter is an early king of the Lombards.Learned (1892), 173. The Chronicon also follows Paul in praising the heretical King Rothari because of his legislation, the Edictum Rothari: \\"In the time of King Rothari, a light arose in the darkness; through him, the aforementioned Lombards strove for canonical rules and became helpers of priests.\\"Istius rothari regis temporibus ortum est lumen in tenebris; per quem supradicti langobardi ad cannonicam tenderunt certamina et sacerdotum facti sunt adiutores, quoted in Everett (2003), 170 n. 30, for whom the phrase \\"helpers of priests\\" is \\"curiously Carolingian\\". The Chronicon diverges from Paul in calling Peredeo, the assassin of the first Lombard king in Italy, Alboin, a mere cubicularius, a type of eunuch.Goffart (1988), 393 n. 201. Unique themes The Chronicon Gothanum is less detailed than the Origo in its narrative of the Lombards' migration from northern Europe to Italy. It says that the Lombards were descended from serpents and describes their movements as being guided by Providence towards a Promised Land (Italy). It credits God with raising them from the dung through conversion and baptism to be among the \\"number of the good\\" (numerum bonorum). It has been suggested that the Chronicon censors the pagan aspects of Lombard history, but while its narrative is more providential, it is not circumspect about the Lombards' paganism.Berto (2010), 31 and n. 44. The author argues that the Lombards came to Italy precisely to be saved, and reminds his readers that \\"where there is no law, sin is not to be imputed\\".Non inputatur peccatum, cum lex non esset, quoted in Berto (2010), 32. The Chronicon says that Alboin saw that God had predestined Pavia to be his capital, whereas Paul the Deacon has a story explaining how Pavia proved itself to be under divine protection. For all the kings of the Lombards after Alboin, the Chronicon gives only the length of reign, except for Rothari. Unlike Paul, the Chronicon does not mention that Rothari was an Arian.Berto (2010), 33. The final sections of the Chronicon are full of lavish praise for Charlemagne and Pippin, the reigning king. The author praises Pippin's conquest of the duchy of Benevento, his victory over the Avars (Abari or Beowinides, i.e. \\"Bohemians\\") and his reconquest of Corsica in 806. In fact, Benevento was never fully subdued and Corsica was raided by the Moors again in 809 and conquered by them in 810.Berto (2010), 34‚Äì35. The Chronicon portrays the first decades of Carolingian rule in Italy as a golden age of peace and prosperity, in contrast to the Historia written by Andreas of Bergamo later that century, which portrays the time as a period of misfortunes and famine.Berto (2010), 38. Magali Coumert argues that the Chronicon stresses continuity between the pagan Lombards and the Carolingians by portraying both the first Lombard king, Angelmund, and Pippin as both fighting the Beowinides (Avars). The two-hundred-year pact the pagan Lombards are said to have made with the Avars while in Pannonia then paved the way for their entry into Italy, and Pippin's victory over the Avars connects the Frankish conquest to the destiny of the now-Christian LombardsBerto (2010), 49 n. 137, summarises Coumert's argument, but disagrees with it.

Description My Father begins with text that explains that Kubota's father died of cancer on the day she had bought a plane ticket from New York City to see him in Japan. That day, she called a friend, who suggested that she film herself while mourning. Images of Kubota's father watching television, one of his favorite pastimes, are dispersed in the video, as are images of Kubota grieving alone in her house. Kubota explains during the video that she took the footage of her father two years earlier in Japan when she visited him after he had first been diagnosed with cancer. The video emphasizes that television compliments memory and that TV monitors are sites of memory and of emotionality, a theme that is suggested in Shigeko Kubota's video eulogies to Nam June Paik in the 1980s and 1990s, Korean Grave, and Winter in Miami. Also, Kubota's Duchampiana series eulogizes Marcel Duchamp, while exploring the presence of the artist in recorded images of him. My Father is an elegy, and a video diary, reflecting on the influence of the technology, and more specifically the television set, on her personal memory of her father, and her emotions of simultaneously grieving and seeing him on a television monitor. Ann-Sargent Wooster argues that My Father explores the ironic duality of the image of a person appearing on a TV screen after they have died‚Äì in a sense, bringing the dead to life.Wooster, Ann- Sargent, ‚ÄúShigeko Kubota: I Travel Alone,‚Äù High Performance, Winter 1991, 28. In the video, Kubota touches the screen of a monitor with her father's image as if reaching out to him. My Father also has been interpreted as performative.Warr, Tracey, and Amelia Jones. 2000.

As Andrew Parker describes the term, \\"performativity has enable a powerful appreciation of the ways that identities are constructed iteratively through complex citational processes.Parker, Andrew and Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky, Performativity and Performance, 1995. 2 My Father has been linked to performativity because of its disruption of the viewer's sense of space and time as Kubota's mourning appears to take place as the figure of her father lingers on the television, both present and absent, as a ghost incarnated.On performativity see: Parker and Sedgwick, Performativity and Performance, 1995; and Mu√±oz, \\"Performing Disidentifications,\\" in Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics, 1999.\\"Self-exploration in multimedia : the experiments of Shigeko Kubota,\\" in Yoshimoto, Midori. 2005.

In 1940 the plant transferred to California-Pacific Utilities Co.; the company operated Fremont until it was shut down in October 1967. The plant stopped generating electricity but remained a tourist attraction, drawing thousands of visitors. In 1993, the building's roof collapsed.

It is the second book in the Boy series, but its story is only loosely connected to that of its predecessor, The Boy Next Door. Synopsis The book follows Kate Mackenzie, who works in the Human Resources division of the New York Journal. She spends much of her days trying to find a good apartment, attempting to avoid her dictator-esque boss Amy, and trying to sort out her complicated relationship with a commitment-phobic boyfriend. Kate begins to despair once Amy forces her to fire an incredibly popular co-worker in one of the office's lunch rooms, which results in the employee suing her for wrongful termination. Things get even worse when she is also obligated to give a deposition to the handsome and wealthy Mitch Hertzog. The two are at odds over several things, but Kate finds herself growing wildly attracted to him. Reception Critical reception for Boy Meets Girl was mostly positive. Publishers Weekly commented that the book was \\"less a novel than a collection of lighthearted barbs, gleeful clich√©s and panicky (but comic and brief) freakouts\\" but ultimately stated it was a \\"fluffy, fun urban fairy tale\\".

The book, whose full title is Pact Ribbentrop - Beck, or How Poles could have defeated the Soviet Union alongside the Third Reich (Polish: Pakt Ribbentrop - Beck czyli jak Polacy mogli u boku III Rzeszy pokonaƒá ZwiƒÖzek Radziecki), was published in 2012 by Dom Wydawniczy Rebis from Pozna≈Ñ. The author argues that the government of the Second Polish Republic should have accepted Adolf Hitler's offer of a joint Polish-German attack on the Soviet Union, together capturing Moscow. \\"Beck\\" refers to J√≥zef Beck, Poland's foreign minister in the 1930s. Background Piotr Zychowicz stated in a November 2012 interview: \\"This book is my answer to the question that all Poles ask. And the question is: did we have to bungle up World War Two so badly? Did we have to lose half of our territory, together with Wilno and Lw√≥w? Did we have to lose our elites, which were slaughtered? Did we have to lose millions of our citizens, murdered by totalitarian occupiers, the Germans and the Soviets? Did we have to lose our independence for 50 years? The answer to these questions is politically incorrect, because Poland was not doomed to fail. And the answer is included in my book, in which I write that history could have been different.\\"Rafa≈Ç Surdacki Wywiad z Piotrem Zychowiczem November 12, 2012 The webpage of the book states: \\"In the history of nations there are moments when one has to bite the bullet and allow for painful concessions. To give up in order to save the nation from destruction, and its citizens from slaughter. This was the situation of Poland in 1939. Piotr Zychowicz claims in his book that the decision to enter the war against Nazi Germany in an illusive alliance with France and Great Britain, was a grave mistake, for which we paid a horrible price. History could have turned in a different way. Instead of biting off more than we could chew, we should have used realpolitik. We should have made concessions to Hitler, and agreed for annexation of the Free City of Danzig into the Third Reich, as well as for the construction of an extraterritorial highway across the Polish Corridor. And then, together with the Germans, we should have attacked the Soviet Union. Forty valiant divisions of the Polish Army, fighting on the Eastern Front would have sealed the fate of Stalin's empire.\\"http://www.paktrb.pl/ In the book, Zychowicz quotes a number of historians and publicists, such as Pawe≈Ç Wieczorkiewicz, Andrzej Wielowieyski, Adolf Boche≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Mackiewicz, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Studnicki, Jerzy ≈Åojek, Grzegorz G√≥rski, Rafa≈Ç Ziemkiewicz, Stanis≈Çaw ≈ªerko, Mieczys≈Çaw Pruszy≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Swianiewicz. He also provides citations from the memoirs of such persons as W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, J√≥zef Beck, Jan Szembek, Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz, Clara Petacci, Kazimierz Sosnkowski, Edward Raczy≈Ñski, August Zaleski. Plot summary The author writes that if Poland had not opposed Adolf Hitler in September 1939, World War II would have started on April 9, 1940, with a German attack on Western Europe. After capturing Paris, and defeating Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and France, on June 21, 1941, the Wehrmacht, together with the Polish Army, invade the Soviet Union. By the winter of 1941/42, the Soviet Union ceases to exist. Poland and Germany divide its territory, but soon afterwards, mutual relationships deteriorate. At the same time, Germany keeps fighting the United Kingdom and the United States. This war is costly, and by 1944, all main units of the Wehrmacht are in Western Europe, fighting the Anglo-Americans, who had landed in France in summer 1944. In those circumstances, Warsaw begins secret negotiations with London and Washington, eventually switching sides, and attacking the Third Reich in 1945. As Zychowicz writes: \\"At this point, Poland should have acted like Romania and Hungary in late stages of World War Two. Noticing German problems in the West, both countries initiated secret negotiations with the Allies. The British and the Americans gladly accepted the offer, understanding that it would weaken the potential of the Axis powers\\". Pact Ribbentrop-Beck page 82 Finally, when the Third Reich prepares for a decisive battle in the West, the Polish Army invades Germany. Surprised, the Wehrmacht does not fight the Poles, who capture Silesia, Eastern Prussia, and Western Pomerania, cutting off all lines of communication with German units which had remained in occupied Soviet Union. In August 1945, the Western Allies capture Berlin, Hitler commits suicide, while Polish armored divisions clear the Baltic States. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia join the federation of Poland, Belarus and Ukraine: \\"The dream of Marshall J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski has become reality. Poland emerges as Great power.

Brown played 128 games over a nine-year career, winning the 1972 and 1973 premierships with Manly. His position of choice was on the . Brown was also the founder of the Men of League foundation in 1999. Career Canterbury- Bankstown Brown, a goal kicking winger, was a Canterbury-Bankstown junior and made his first grade debut in 1966. He was the Berries (as the Bulldogs were then known) top try scorer in 1967 scoring 10 tries, but injury kept him out of the teams finals campaign, which famously included stopping the St. George Dragons in the preliminary final, ending the Dragons bid for a 12th straight premiership. Canterbury would go down 10-12 to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the Grand Final. Max Brown played a further 3 seasons with Canterbury, totaling 24 tries and 6 goals from 64 games before signing to play with Manly from 1971. Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Brown was signed by Manly boss Ken Arthurson and for five years played alongside the likes of Graham Eadie, Ken Irvine, Bob Fulton, Terry Randall, and English hard man Mal Reilly. He was a member of the Sea Eagles first two premiership's in 1972 and 1973 over Eastern Suburbs and Cronulla respectively and was the Sea Eagles leading goal kicker in 1972 with 29 goals. Brown, who in an era when foul play was still rife in rugby league, wasn't one who often got involved in dirty play, though he did hit replacement Cronulla fullback Rick Bourke with a swinging arm as Bourke crossed for Cronulla's only try of the 1973 Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Bourke was flattened and Brown broke his right thumb in the incident. Some 30 years later Brown was able to catch up with Bourke and apologise for the incident (the 1973 GF was known as the toughest of them all with many fights breaking out during the game). Max Brown retired from playing after 1975. He played 128 games in 9 seasons (64 for both Canterbury and Manly), scoring 44 tries and kicking 39 goals. Personal life Brown, like South Sydney's dual international winger Michael Cleary, sometimes worked as a male model outside of the game at a time when working class rugby league players didn't do such things, and years before players such as Andrew Ettingshausen and Craig Wing were able to use their good looks to earn a living away from rugby league. Men of League In 1999 Max Brown was diagnosed with cancer that he had reportedly had for over 7 years (it was only found out when the tumor burst inside him resulting in emergency surgery). The cancer was believed to have been caused by a simple rub down cream he and other players had been using for years after training and games. Brown was forced to take over 6 months off from work while he was undergoing treatment, and it was during this time that he came up with the idea for the Men of League foundation to assist rugby league players, coaches, referees, officials and administrators ‚Äì from all levels of the game ‚Äì plus members of their families who have fallen on hard times After struggling to get the foundation up and running for six months, Brown, Jim Hall and Ron Coote contacted current National Rugby League auditor Ian Schubert who jumped on board and helped organise the first ever Men of League function at the NSW Leagues Club in Sydney.Max Brown's '73 GF redemption References External links *Bulldogs profile *Men of League Category:1946 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs players Category:Manly Warringah Sea Eagles players Category:Living people Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Rugby league players from Sydney ","title":"Max Brown (rugby league)"},{"id":"39096419","text":"Mykola Volodymyrovych Porsh () was a political and civil activist of Ukraine, economist, member of the Russian Constituent Assembly.

The unique home, sometimes branded as a castle, was built in 1900 by architect George Behrensmeyer for wealthy Quincy native W. George Metz. Metz had a fondness for Mediterranean architecture, and used the Villa Kathrine as his home when he was not venturing the world. Metz eventually sold the castle in 1912, and the site fell into disrepair and neglect before the non-profit Friends of the Castle sought to restore the Villa in 1978. Work on restoring the castle was completed in 1998, and appropriate site furnishings have been donated and obtained by staff throughout the years to further enhance the castle's Moroccan roots. Currently, the site functions as the official tourist information center to the City of Quincy and tours are granted of the site on an appointment basis. Inside, the castle features a harem, a courtyard, and a reflecting pool. Much of the designs for the interior and exterior of the building were based upon W. George Metz's sketches of Islamic architecture that he observed during his global travels. In 2010, the Villa Kathrine was used as a filming location in the Struber Productions film, Fang, which has yet to be released.  Legend  According to local legend, Metz shared his travels with a woman he met in Germany and intended to bring her to Quincy. The woman, however refused to move into the lavish new home that Metz had commissioned, and Metz returned to the United States broken-hearted and alone. Another version of the story states that this mysterious woman died en route to Quincy. It was reported that Metz was not a total recluse after his heartbreak, as he was known throughout the community for hosting lavish parties at his home and dining with friends. But for twelve years, the only companion to share in his dream house was his 212-pound Great Dane named Bingo. Upon Bingo's death, Metz fell into a great depression and sold the house in 1912 at the request of his family. He ended up selling the Villa Kathrine to prospective occupants which were actually agents for the railroad industry. When word got out that they intended to demolish the site in favor of a railroad yard, vandals sacked the building and stole the furnishings. When Metz saw the neglect, he vowed never to return to the site again. He would later return to the castle with press and exclaim that he wished he still owned the site, so that he would tear it down. Bingo, the dog, has been said to be haunting the building. Rumors have also circulated that Bingo was buried with a large cache of gold somewhere on the site, but the canine body has yet to be found.

The Oscars were dominated by uncontroversial designs in solid colours which led to criticism of \\"safe\\" choices, and drew attention to those who dressed more individually, such as Tilda Swinton and Marion Cotillard. Golden Globe Awards (January 13) Due to the writer's strike the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony was not held, with a press conference instead announcing that year's winners. Almost all the celebrities who intended to attend promised to boycott the awards rather than cross threatened picket lines. The cancellation of the Golden Globes was seen as disastrous for the fashion industry, as not only were established designers affected, but the opportunity for up-and-coming designers to achieve widespread recognition through red-carpet exposure of their designs had been severely limited, particularly with the Oscars also under threat. Academy Awards (February 24) The writer's strike, which threatened the 80th Oscars ceremony, was lifted on February 12, enabling the event to go ahead. One-shouldered or strapless gowns and solid-coloured, predominantly red dresses were widely worn for the event, going against the trend for vibrant prints. Although the \\"uniform timelessness\\" of the 2008 Oscar gowns was noted and appreciated, they were also criticised for being \\"safe\\" choices. Hilary Alexander of The Daily Telegraph reported losing count of all the \\"fitted, strapless, fishtail hem gowns\\", and Hal Rubenstein, fashion director at InStyle, also noticed a prevalence of timelessly classic solid-coloured strapless dresses. Simon Doonan described the guests as looking like a \\"bunch of Republican drears on their way to a constipated night out at the local country club\\" in their \\"fussy bustier gowns\\", applauding Tilda Swinton's individualism in her unusual one-sleeved black toga gown by Alber Elbaz for Lanvin. He said that the \\"lowbrow media\\", by criticising anything quirky or unusual dress-wise, had led to many celebrities dressing much more cautiously in order not to attract the \\"fashion fascism\\" of negative publicity. Rubenstein also shared Doonan's admiration for Swinton's dress, saying \\"This unique dress may have received criticism, but taking a risk at the Oscars is a winning move that we applaud,\\" and included it in 90th place in InStyle's list of the 100 Best Dresses of the Decade. Hilary Alexander was less convinced, calling Swinton's gown a \\"shroud\\", while others compared it to \\"trash bags\\". Swinton later said that she asked for a comfortable dress that would attract minimal attention, and commented ‚ÄúLittle did I know that the really simple, chic dress one might have worn in Paris or Berlin would stick out like a sore thumb in Los Angeles.‚Äù Also standing out from the norm, but more universally approved, was Marion Cotillard's white and silver Jean Paul Gaultier mermaid gown with a fishscale pattern which both Alexander and Rubenstein admired. Cotillard was also praised by The Times-Picayune for bucking the trend for red and wearing the \\"most inventive look of the evening\\", whilst Pieta Woolley at The Georgia Straight said \\"the only truly Hollywood-worthy gown of the evening\\". Rubenstein, listing Cotillard's dress as one of the decade's 100 best, declared it \\"a great introduction for Cotillard. No one is going to repeat this dress.\\" Cosmopolitan magazine, listing the best dresses worn on the red carpet, singled out Katherine Heigl's relaxed, \\"sex bomb\\" appearance in her vermilion one-shouldered gown by Escada. The dress was described as transforming Heigl from \\"daffy\\" into a \\"cinema diva\\" and was remembered by Heigl's stylist Nicole Chavez as a \\"game-changer\\". The Rocky Mountain News said of Heigl, \\"Now, this is what a movie star should look like,\\" and the reviewers at The Register-Mail all agreed that Heigl looked outstanding. Also in shades of red were Anne Hathaway, Miley Cyrus, Helen Mirren, Ruby Dee, and Heidi Klum, whose extravagant Galliano gown was auctioned off for the charity The Heart Truth. Alongside Heigl and Hathaway, one-shouldered designs were worn by Hilary Swank and Olivia Thirlby. Emmys (21 September) Fashions on the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards continued the trend for bold colours and one-shoulder designs seen at the Oscars, with trends for metallic, lace and feature necklines (either plunging, sweetheart, or jewel-embellished) also observed by InStyle. Whilst reported on at the time, few of the looks received in-depth coverage, and InStyle did not choose any dresses from the event for their Top 100 dresses of the decade.

She was a member of the second subgroup of the class, and saw service through most of World War II. Construction and commissioning Blencathra was ordered under the 1939 War Emergency Build Programme from Cammell Laird, Birkenhead, on 4 September 1939. She was laid down as Job Number V1048 on 11 or 18 November 1939 and launched on 6 August 1940. She was completed on 14 December 1940 and immediately commissioned, under the command of Commander Hugh Waters Shelley Browning, RN. Service history Home waters, 1941-1943 Upon commissioning, Blencathra immediately began acceptance trials, followed by work-ups. With these completed, she reported for duty in January 1941 with the 1st Destroyer Flotilla, based at Portsmouth, to perform patrol and convoy defence duty in the English Channel. On 12 May 1941, she joined her sister ship in escorting the heavy cruiser from Portsmouth to Rosyth, Scotland, where Berwick was to complete repairs, then returned to her routine duties. In March 1942, she was \\"adopted\\" by the community of Keswick, then in Cumberland, as the result of a successful Warship Week national savings campaign. On 14 March 1942, she took part in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the German merchant raider before Michel could break out into the North Atlantic Ocean, and suffered damage when Michel fired on her. On 18 June 1942, German aircraft damaged her with cannon fire and near misses by bombs when the convoy she was escorting in the English Channel came under air attack. In the second half of 1942, Blencathra was transferred to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla - to which her sister ships , , , , , , , and also were assigned - based at Sheerness, for duty escorting convoys between the Thames Estuary and the Forth Estuary. While she was escorting Convoy FS 1074 on 28 March 1943 German E-boats attacked, but the destroyer drove them off. Mediterranean, 1943 In May 1943, the Royal Navy selected Blencathra for participation in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily planned for July 1943, and she began preparations for foreign service. In June 1943 she proceeded from Harwich to the River Clyde, where on 21 June 1943 she joined the light cruiser , the destroyers , , , and , and the escort destroyers , , , , , , and Mendip as escort for the military Convoy WS 31/KMF 17 for the Clyde-Gibraltar leg of its voyage. On 26 June 1943, the convoys divided and the Gibraltar-based destroyers , , and and escort destroyer took over the escort of WS 31 as it continued its voyage to Freetown, Sierra Leone, on its way to the Middle East, while Blencanthra and her consorts pressed on to Gibraltar as the escort of KMF 17, arriving there on 28 June 1943. While at Gibraltar in early July 1943, Blencathra was transferred to the 58th Destroyer Division of the Mediterranean Fleet, assigned to escort military convoys to Sicily for the amphibious landings there. After pre-invasion exercises, she escorted assault convoys on 9 July 1943 and, after they arrived at the invasion beaches on 10 July 1943, the first day of the invasion, was assigned to defense of the beachhead and of later convoys bringing in reinforcements and supplies. In August 1943, Blencathra and the rest of the 58th Destroyer Division was based at Malta and assigned to patrol and escort duty in the central Mediterranean Sea. During the month, she was selected to participate in Operation Avalanche, the Allied landings at Salerno on the mainland of Italy planned for September 1943. On 9 September 1943, she took part in the initial Salerno landings, then protected the beachhead and convoys bringing in reinforcements and supplies. Released from Operation Avalanche in October 1943, Blencathra next operated in the Aegean Sea to assist in the unsuccessful Allied attempt to defend Italian-held islands there against invasion by German forces during the Dodecanese Campaign, sheltering in neutral Turkish waters at night to avoid German air attack. On 8 October 1943 she conducted a search for German craft carrying troops to the islands, and on 27 October 1943 she joined her sister ship and the destroyer in escorting the light cruiser as the cruiser deployed to the Aegean Sea to relieve the light cruiser on interception duty there. On 9 November 1943, Blencathra conducted an interception patrol off Amorgas in company with her sister ship Exmoor and the destroyer . On 13 November 1943 she sortied from Alexandria, Egypt, to support Allied military operations ashore on the Aegean islands and on 14 November 1943 she joined her sister ship and the destroyer in bombarding German positions at Alinda Bay on Leros. On 19 November 1943 she towed her sister ship , which had suffered damage when hit by a German glide bomb, from Turkish waters to Alexandria. After the Dodecanese Campaign ended in an Allied defeat, Blencathra and the rest of the 58th Destroyer Division were based at Alexandria in December 1943 for patrol and escort duties in the Eastern Mediterranean. Mediterranean, 1944 In January 1944, the 58th Destroyer Division was transferred to Malta, where it conducted patrols and escorted convoys in the central Mediterranean, including the protection of shipping supporting Operation Shingle, the Allied invasion at Anzio and Nettuno, Italy. On 9 March 1944, the 58th Destroyer Division deployed for antisubmarine operations in support of Shingle, and on 10 March 1944 Blencathra joined her sister ships Blankney, Brecon, and Exmoor, the destroyer , and the United States Navy destroyer in a depth-charge attack in the Tyrrhenian Sea south of Ostia, Italy, that forced the German submarine to the surface. U-450 scuttled herself at position , and Urchin rescued her entire crew. On 29 March 1944, Blencathra, Hambledon, and their sister ship departed Naples to assist the destroyers , , and in hunting the German submarine , which they had detected with asdic in the Tyrrhenian Sea northeast of Palermo, Sicily, near Filicudi, 135 nautical miles (250 km) south of Naples. They attacked U-223 with depth charges until Laforey ordered them to halt, then continued to track U-223 for several hours until she was forced to surface in the early hours of 30 March 1944 after 27 hours of attack by depth charges and Hedgehog antisubmarine mortars. Blencathra joined the other ships in illuminating U-223 with searchlights and sinking her with gunfire at position with the loss of 23 of the submarines crew, leaving 27 survivors, but not before U-223 sank Laforey with an acoustic torpedo with the loss of 182 lives, leaving 69 survivors. In April 1944, the Royal Navy selected Blencathra, Hambledon, and Mendip to participate in Operation Neptune, the initial assault phase of the Allied invasion of Normandy scheduled for early June 1944. Accordingly, Hambledon departed the Mediterranean that month and proceeded to the United Kingdom. Home waters, 1944-1945 In May 1944, Blencathra was assigned to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Sheerness and began exercises to prepare for the Normandy invasion. In early June 1944, she joined the 113th Escort Group - consisting of the frigates and and the sloops and - and steamed with it to Milford Haven, Wales, from which the group was to escort Convoy EBP 2 - five troop transports carrying United States Army troops for discharge on Utah Beach, the headquarters ship for Mulberry B, and three smaller merchant ships - to Normandy. The landings were postponed 24 hours to 6 June 1944 due to bad weather, but the convoy steamed out of the Bristol Channel that day protected by the 113th Escort Group and the frigates and of the 112th Escort Group, passed through the Solent on 7 June 1944, and arrived off Utah Beach on 8 June 1944. Blencathra then steamed to Plymouth and, based there with Hambledon and Mendip, defended convoys carrying reinforcements and supplies to the Normandy beachheads until released from such duties on 30 June 1944. After the termination of Operation Neptune, Blencathra remained in the English Channel to patrol, protect convoys, and support military operations in France through August 1944. On 3 August 1944 she suffered damage when she attempted to salvage a captured German human torpedo and its scuttling charge detonated. In September 1944, the Royal Navy assigned Blencathra to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Sheerness for patrol and convoy defence operations in the North Sea under the control of the Nore Command, and she continued these operations until Germany surrendered in early May 1945. After that, she operated in support of re-occupation forces and visited ports in the United Kingdom and on the European continent until 15 August 1945, when she suffered damage in a collision with the merchant ship . After repairs and the removal of her armament and other modifications at the dockyard at Rosyth, Blencathra reentered service in October 1945 as a target ship in the North Sea for the training of aircrews in the identification and targeting of ships. Withdrawn from this duty in June 1948, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve in July 1948. Reserve and disposal Blencathra was placed in reserve in the Harwich Division of the Reserve Fleet in 1948. In April 1950, it was proposed that the United Kingdom sell her to Norway, but the sale never occurred. In 1953 she was transferred to the Reserve Fleets Barrow-in-Furness Division. She was among ten Hunt-class escort destroyers placed on the disposal list in October 1956 and was sold to the British Iron & Steel Corporation (BISCO) for scrapping before the end of the year. BISCO allocated her to Thos W Ward to be broken up. Taken under tow, she arrived at Wards yard on 2 January 1957 and was scrapped.

To adequately improve the health of women in India multiple dimensions of wellbeing must be analysed in relation to global health averages and also in comparison to men in India. Health is an important factor that contributes to human wellbeing and economic growth.Ariana, Proochista and Arif Naveed. An Introduction to the Human Development Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency. London: Earthscan, 2009. 228-245. Print. Currently, women in India face a multitude of health problems, which ultimately affect the aggregate economy's output. Addressing the gender, class or ethnic disparities that exist in healthcare and improving the health outcomes can contribute to economic gain through the creation of quality human capital and increased levels of savings and investment. Gender bias in access to healthcare The United Nations ranks India as a middle-income country.United Nations. \\"Sustainability and Equity: A Better Future for All.\\" Human Development Report 2011. (2011): n. page. Web. 12 April 2013. Findings from the World Economic Forum indicate that India is one of the worst countries in the world in terms of gender inequality. The 2011 United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187 in terms of gender inequality. The value of this multidimensional indicator, Gender Inequality Index (GII) is determined by numerous factors including maternal mortality rate, adolescent fertility rate, educational achievement and labour force participation rate. Gender inequality in India is exemplified by women's lower likelihood of being literate, continuing their education and participating in the labour force. Gender is one of the main social determinants of health‚Äîwhich include social, economic, and political factors‚Äîthat play a major role in the health outcomes of women in India and access to healthcare in India. Therefore, the high level of gender inequality in India negatively impacts the health of women. Studies have indicated that boys are more likely to receive treatment from health care facilities compared to girls, when controlled for SES status. The role that gender plays in health care access can be determined by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother's pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family's preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty- affected areas. The low status of‚Äîand subsequent discrimination against‚Äîwomen in India can be attributed to many cultural norms. Societal forces of patriarchy, hierarchy and multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles. Men use greater privileges and superior rights to create an unequal society that leaves women with little to no power. This societal structure is exemplified with women's low participation within India's national parliament and the labour force. Women are also seen as less valuable to a family due to marriage obligations. Although illegal, Indian cultural norms often force payment of a dowry to the husband's family. The higher future financial burden of daughters creates a power structure that favours sons in household formation. Additionally, women are often perceived as being incapable of taking care of parents in old age, which creates even greater preference for sons over daughters. Taken together, women are oftentimes seen less valuable than men. With lower involvement in the public sphere‚Äîas exemplified by the labour and political participation rates‚Äîand the stigma of being less valuable within a family, women face a unique form of gender discrimination. Gender inequalities, in turn, are directly related to poor health outcomes for women. Numerous studies have found that the rates of admission to hospitals vary dramatically with gender, with men visiting hospitals more frequently than women. Differential access to healthcare occurs because women typically are entitled to a lower share of household resources and thus utilise healthcare resources to a lesser degree than men. Amartya Sen has attributed access to fewer household resources to their weaker bargaining power within the household. Furthermore, it has been found that Indian women frequently underreport illnesses. The underreporting of illness may be contributed to these cultural norms and gender expectations within the household. Gender also dramatically influences the use of antenatal care and utilisation of immunisations. A study by Choi in 2006 found that boys are more likely to receive immunisations than girls in rural areas. This finding has led researchers to believe that the sex of a child leads to different levels of health care being administered in rural areas. There is also a gender component associated with mobility. Indian women are more likely to have difficulty traveling in public spaces than men, resulting in greater difficulty to access services. Cooperative conflicts approach to gender biases Amartya Sen's cooperative conflicts approach to gender biases frames women's gender disadvantage through three different responses: breakdown wellbeing, perceived interest and perceived contribution responses. The breakdown well-being response‚Äîderived from the Nash equilibrium‚Äîdescribes breakdown positions between individuals during cooperative decisions. When the breakdown position of one individual is less than the other person, the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual.Sen, Amartya. \\"Gender and cooperative conflicts.\\" Wider Working Papers. 18. (1987) Web. 28 April 2013. In terms of women's health in India, the overall gender disadvantage facing women‚Äîrepresented by cultural and societal factors that favour men over women‚Äînegatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare. The perceived interest response describes the outcome of a bargained decision when one individual attaches less value to his or her well-being. Any bargaining solution derived between the aforementioned individual and another individual will always result in a less favourable outcome for the person who attaches less value to their well-being. The health status of women in India relates to the perceived interest response because of the societal and cultural practices that create an environment where the self-worth of women is marginalised compared to men. Therefore, outcomes relating to healthcare decisions within households will favour the men, due to greater self-worth. The perceived contribution response describes the more favourable position of an individual when the individual's contribution is perceived as contributing more to a group than other individuals. The more favourable perception gives the individual a better outcome in a bargaining solution. In terms of women's health in India, males‚Äô perceived contribution to household productivity is higher than that of women, which ultimately affects the bargaining power that women have with regards to accessing healthcare. Problems with India‚Äôs healthcare system At the turn of the 21st Century India's health care system is strained in terms of the number of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses. The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas. This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results. It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training. Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic (mainstream medical) providers actually had no medical training; this phenomenon varies geographically. Women are negatively affected by the geographic bias within implementation of the current healthcare system in India. Of all health workers in the country, nearly two thirds are men. This especially affects rural areas where it has been found that out of all doctors, only 6 percent are women. This translates into approximately 0.5 female allopathic physicians per 10,000 individuals in rural areas. A disparity in access to maternal care between rural and urban populations is one of the ramifications of a highly concentrated urban medical system. According to Government of India National Family Health Survey (NFHS II, 1998-1999) the maternal mortality in rural areas is approximately 132 percent the number of maternal mortality in urban areas. The Indian government has taken steps to alleviate some of the current gender inequalities. In 1992, the government of India established the National Commission for Women. The Commission was meant to address many of the inequalities women face, specifically rape, family and guardianship. However, the slow pace of change in the judicial system and the aforementioned cultural norms have prevented the full adoption of policies meant to promote equality between men and women. In 2005 India enacted the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Some of its primary goals were to reduce infant mortality and also the maternal mortality ratio. Additionally, the NHRM aimed to create universal access to public health services and also balance the gender ratio.Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, . \\"About NHRM.\\" National Rural Health Mission. Government of India. Web. 28 April 2013. However, a 2011 research study conducted by Nair and Panda found that although India was able to improve some measures of maternal health since the enactment of the NHRM in 2005, the country was still far behind most emerging economies. Outcomes Health problems of tribal women The high incidence of breast lumps among Adivasi women of Adilabad in Telangana has created apprehension of more serious health impacts for this remote population.‚ÄúLeave alone breast cancer or any other type of carcinoma, even routine mammarian infections were unknown among indigenous people belonging to the Gond, Pardhan, Kolam and Thotti,‚Äù points out Dr. Thodsam Chandu, the District Immunisation Officer, himself a Gond. Malnutrition and morbidity Poverty and malnutrition are common issues faced by Indian women. Nutrition plays a major role in and individual's overall health; psychological and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries.Jose, Sunny, and K Navaneetham. \\"A Factsheet on Women's Malnutrtion in India.\\" Economic and Political Weekly. 43.33 (2008): 61-67. Web. 21 February 2013. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources. A 2012 study by Tarozzi have found the nutritional intake of early adolescents to be approximately equal. However, the rate of malnutrition increases for women as they enter adulthood. Furthermore, Jose et al. found that malnutrition increased for ever-married women compared to non-married women. Maternal malnutrition has been associated with an increased risk of maternal mortality and also child birth defects. Addressing the problem of malnutrition would lead to beneficial outcomes for women and children. Breast cancer India is facing a growing cancer epidemic, with a large increase in the number of women with breast cancer. By the year 2020 nearly 70 percent of the world's cancer cases will come from developing countries, with a fifth of those cases coming from India. Much of the sudden increase in breast cancer cases is attributed to the rise in Westernisation of the country. This includes, but is not limited to, westernised diet, greater urban concentrations of women, and later child bearing. Additionally, problems with India's health care infrastructure prevent adequate screenings and access for women, ultimately leading to lower health outcomes compared to more developed countries. As of 2012, India has a shortage of trained oncologists and cancer centres, further straining the health care system. Maternal health Maternal health: parental awareness class for women in Kerala. The lack of maternal health contributes to future economic disparities for mothers and their children. Poor maternal health often affects a child's health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman's ability to participate in economic activities. Therefore, national health programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the maternal health care needs of women across India. Although India has witnessed dramatic growth over the last two decades, maternal mortality remains stubbornly high in comparison to many developing nations As a nation, India contributed nearly 20 percent of all maternal deaths worldwide between 1992 and 2006. Factors contributing to high maternal mortality rates are often associated with utilization of antenatal care (ANC) prior to and during childbirth. Barriers to seeking care include delays in the decision to seek care, arrival at a medical institution, and provision of quality care. Autonomy and empowerment are correlated with the decision to seek care; women who are more actively involved in their family's decision-making processes are able to choose to utilize maternal care resources. As a result, ANC utilization is lower for Muslim women and women in joint families. Custom may also dictate that maternal care is unnecessary, particularly during the first trimester which has the lowest rates of ANC utilization. The cost of institutional care may also cause women to seek alternative care, such as utilizing a dai (traditional birth attendant) during childbirth. Dais are particularly useful options for care in low-resource settings. Arrival at a medical institution is often largely complicated by distance. Women may not have access to transportation, or they may not be able to reach an institution for childbirth after labor has initiated. Even if a woman chooses to seek maternal care and is able to successfully access a medical facility, poor quality of care can deter care utilization. Resources such as midwives, qualified doctors, or ambulances are not readily available at all hospitals; rural areas are especially lacking in these resources, leading to significantly lower ANC utilization compared to urban areas. However, maternal mortality is not identical across all of India or even a particular state; urban areas often have lower overall maternal mortality due to the availability of adequate medical resources. For example, states with higher literacy and growth rates tend to have greater maternal health and also lower infant mortality, reporting higher rates of maternal care utilization compared to their rural counterparts. =HIV/AIDS= As of July 2005, women represent approximately 40 percent of the HIV/AIDS cases in India. The number of infections is rising in many locations in India; the rise can be attributed to cultural norms, lack of education, and lack of access to contraceptives such as condoms. The government public health system does not provide adequate measures such as free HIV testing, only further worsening the problem. Cultural aspects also increase the prevalence of HIV infection. The insistence of a woman for a man to use a condom could imply promiscuity on her part, and thus may hamper the usage of protective barriers during sex. Furthermore, one of the primary methods of contraception among women has historically been sterilisation, which does not protect against the transmission of HIV. The current mortality rate of HIV/AIDS is higher for women than it is for men. As with other forms of women's health in India the reason for the disparity is multidimensional. Due to higher rates of illiteracy and economic dependence on men, women are less likely to be taken to a hospital or receive medical care for health needs in comparison to men. This creates a greater risk for women to suffer from complications associated with HIV. There is also evidence to suggest that the presence of HIV/AIDS infection in a woman could result in lower or no marriage prospects, which creates greater stigma for women suffering from HIV/AIDS. =Reproductive rights= India legalised abortion through legislation in the early 1970s. However, access remains limited to cities. Less than 20 percent of health care centres are able to provide the necessary services for an abortion. The current lack of access is attributed to a shortage of physicians and lack of equipment to perform the procedure. The most common foetus that is aborted in India is a female one. Numerous factors contribute to the abortion of female foetuses. For example, women who are highly educated and had a first-born female child are the most likely to abort a female. The act of sex-selective abortion has contributed to a skewed male to female ratio. As of the 2011 census, the sex ratio among children aged 0‚Äì6 continued a long trend towards more males. The preference for sons over daughters in India is rooted in social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non- breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One of the main reasons behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter. Cardiovascular health Cardiovascular disease is a major contributor to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue.Indian Heart Association Why South Asians Facts 26 April 2015. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women were less likely to be operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable. Furthermore, it was found that families failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories. A study conducted by Pednekar et al. in 2011 found that out of 100 boys and girls with congenital heart disease, 70 boys would have an operation while only 22 girls will receive similar treatment. The primary driver of this difference is due to cultural standards that give women little leverage in the selection of their partner. Elder family members must find suitable husbands for young females in the households. If women are known to have adverse previous medical histories, their ability to find a partner is significantly reduced. This difference leads to diverging health outcomes for men and women. Mental health Mental health consists of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also evidence to suggest that disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders. One of the most common disorders that disproportionately affect women in low-income countries is depression.Marcus, Marina, Yasamy M, et al. \\"Depression: a global public health concern.\\" World Federation of Mental Health. 6-8. PDF Indian women suffer from depression at higher rates than Indian men. Indian women who are faced with greater degrees of poverty and gender disadvantage show a higher rate of depression. The difficulties associated with interpersonal relationships‚Äîmost often marital relationships‚Äîand economic disparities have been cited as the main social drivers of depression. It was found that Indian women typically describe the somatic symptoms rather than the emotional and psychological stressors that trigger the symptoms of depression. This often makes it difficult to accurately assess depression among women in India in light of no admonition of depression. Gender plays a major role in postnatal depression among Indian women. Mothers are often blamed for the birth of a female child. Furthermore, women who already have a female child often face additional pressures to have male children that add to their overall stress level. Women in India have a lower onset of schizophrenia than men. However, women and men differ in the associated stigmas they must face. While men tend to suffer from occupational functioning, while women suffer in their marital functioning. The time of onset also plays a role in the stigmatisation of schizophrenia. Women tend to be diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life, oftentimes following the birth of their children. The children are often removed from the care of the ill mother, which may cause further distress. =Suicide= Indian women have higher rates of suicide than women in most developed countries. Women in India also have a higher rate of suicide compared to men. The most common reasons cited for women's suicide are directly related to depression, anxiety, gender disadvantage and anguish related to domestic violence. Many of the high rates of suicide found across India and much of south Asia have been correlated with gender disadvantage. Gender disadvantage is often expressed through domestic violence towards women. The suicide rate is particularly high among female sex workers in India, who face numerous forms of discrimination for their gender and line of work. Domestic violence Women who are in the labour force in India often face greater risk of being the victims of domestic violence Domestic violence is a major problem in India. Domestic violence‚Äîacts of physical, psychological, and sexual violence against women‚Äîis found across the world and is currently viewed as a hidden epidemic by the World Health Organization. The effects of domestic violence go beyond the victim; generational and economic effects influence entire societies. Economies of countries where domestic violence is prevalent tend to have lower female labour participation rate, in addition to higher medical expenses and higher rates of disability. Approximately one third of Indian women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) during their adult years. The prevalence of domestic violence in India is associated with the cultural norms of patriarchy, hierarchy, and multigenerational families. Patriarchal domination occurs when males use superior rights, privileges and power to create a social order that gives women and men differential gender roles. The resultant power structure leaves women as powerless targets of domestic violence. Men use domestic violence as a way of controlling behaviour. In a response to the 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey III, 31 percent of all women reported having been the victims of physical violence in the 12 months preceding the survey. However, the actual number of victims may be much higher. Women who are victimised by domestic violence may underreport or fail to report instances. This may be due to a sense of shame or embarrassment stemming from cultural norms associated with women being subservient to their husbands. Furthermore, underreporting by women may occur in order to protect family honour. A 2012 study conducted by Kimuna, using data from the 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey III, found that domestic violence rates vary across numerous sociological, geographical and economic measures. The study found that the poorest women faired worst among middle and high-income women. Researchers believe that the reason for higher rates of domestic violence come from greater familial pressures resulting from poverty. Additionally the study found that women who were part of the labour force faced greater domestic violence. According to the researchers, working women may be upsetting the patriarchal power system within Indian households. Men may feel threatened by the earning potential and independence of women and react violently to shift the gender power structure back in their favour. One of the largest factors associated with domestic violence against women was the prevalence of alcohol use by men within the households. A 2005 study conducted by Pradeep Panda and Bina Agarwal found that the incidence of domestic violence against women dropped dramatically with women's ownership of immovable property, which includes land and housing.

In 2013, manta rays were listed as CITES Appendix II species, which gives them some international protection. Threatened rays are those vulnerable to endangerment (extinction) in the near future. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the world's oldest global environmental organisation.International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 16 March 2013. It evaluates threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories, depending on the degree to which they are threatened: ::File:VU IUCN 3 1.svg Vulnerable species ::File:EN IUCN 3 1.svg Endangered species ::File:CR IUCN 3 1.svg Critically endangered species The term threatened strictly refers to these three categories (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable), while vulnerable is used to refer to the least at risk of these categories. The terms can be used somewhat interchangeably, as all vulnerable species are threatened, all endangered species are vulnerable and threatened, and all critically endangered species are endangered, vulnerable and threatened. Threatened species are also referred to as a red-listed species, as they are listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Together rays and sharks make up the class of modern cartilaginous fishes. Modern fish are either cartilaginous or bony. Cartilaginous fishes have skeletons made of cartilage while bony fishes have skeletons made of bone. Because rays and sharks are closely related, they are often studied together. In 2010 a global IUCN study of vertebrates found that of 1,044 cartilaginous (ray and shark) species examined, 345 or 33% were threatened with extinction.Third of Shark and Ray Species Are Threatened, Study Suggests Science News, 27 October 2010.Hoffmann M, C Hilton-Taylor and 173 others (2010) \\"The impact of conservation on the status of the world's vertebrates\\" Science, 330: 1503‚Äì1509. There are four orders of rays: stingrays, skates, electric rays and sawfishes. Like sharks, rays are relatively long living and thrive in stable populations. They are K-strategists which grow slowly, mature late sexually and produce few offspring. They cannot recover as rapidly as many faster growing fish can if their populations are depleted.Conservation of Sharks CITES AC18 Inf. 1, 2002. As with sharks, rays are increasingly becoming vulnerable because of commercial and recreational fishing pressures, the impact of non-ray fisheries on the seabed and ray prey species, and other habitat alterations such as damage and loss from coastal development and marine pollution. Most particularly, the continuing decline of threatened rays and sharks is the consequence of unregulated fishing.The Future of Sharks: A Review of Action and Inaction CITES AC25 Inf. 6, 2011. Sawfish are a family of rays which have a long rostrum resembling a saw. All species in the family are either endangered or critically endangered Manta rays are largest rays in the world, with wingspans reaching 7 metres.Glider of the sea threatened by 'traditional' medicine New Scientist, 25 March 2013. They have one of the highest brain-to- body mass ratios of all fish. Manta populations suffer when they are caught as bycatch by fishermen fishing for other species, but fisheries which target manta rays are even more harmful. Manta rays use their gills to filter plankton from the sea. Demand for their dried gill rakers, cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has been growing in traditional Chinese medicine practices. The market is \\"bogus\\" since dried manta gills have never been used historically in Chinese medicine, and there is no evidence that the gills have any medicinal value.Manta Rays Endangered by Sudden Demand from Chinese Medicine ScientificAmerican, 17 January 2012.\\"The global threat to manta and mobula rays\\" WildAid and Shark Savers. 2011 report. The flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is tough and unattractive compared to other fish. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in other parts of the world, including Sri Lanka, Indonesia, West Africa and Central and South America. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily the giant manta ray, are being caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka estimated that over a thousand of these were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. In 2011, manta rays became strictly protected in international waters thanks to their recent inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. In 2013, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed both species of manta rays as CITES Appendix II species. This means that the international trade of manta rays will now be monitored and regulated.Proposal 46: Genus Manta CITES, Sixteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties Bangkok (Thailand), 3‚Äì14 March 2013.CITES conference takes decisive action to halt decline of tropical timber, sharks, manta rays and a wide range of other plants and animals Sawfish are a less well known family of rays which have a long rostrum resembling a saw. Some species can reach in length. All species of sawfish are either endangered or critically endangered as a result of habitat destruction and overfishing. Their young stay close to shore, and are particularly affected by coastal developments.Sawfish Is First Sea Fish on U.S. Endangered List National Geographic News, 4 June 2003. Because their rostrum is easily entangled, sawfishes can easily become bycatch in fishing nets. They are also exploited for the novelty value of their rostrum, their fins are eaten as a delicacy in China, and their liver oil used as a food supplement. While arguing for a global ban on international commerce in 2007, a representative from the National Museums of Kenya stated, \\"Only the meat is consumed locally; and artisanal fishermen can retire after catching one sawfish due to the high value of a single rostrum, up to $1,450.\\" In 2013 CITES uplisted the largetooth sawfish to Appendix I. This is CITES highest protection level, and means that all international trade of the species is banned.Proposal 45: Pristis microdon CITES, Sixteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties Bangkok (Thailand), 3‚Äì14 March 2013. { \\"sortable wikitable\\" - !

This coral is found in shallow waters on reefs and in lagoons in tropical parts of the Indo-Pacific region. Description Colonies of this species have vertical, irregular, two-sided fronds about tall and not more than thick. The corallites housing the polyps are very shallow and form widely separated rows parallel to the margins of the fronds. The bases of these fronds may be dead while the upper parts are still alive supported by the skeletal tissue below. The fronds may be clustered together in a supercolony formed from one or more individual colonies and extending for several metres (yards) across the seabed. This is a zooxanthellate species of coral, with symbiotic microscopic algae living in its tissues. It is an olive green or a brownish colour. Distribution Pavona cactus is found in the tropical Indo-Pacific, its range extending from the Red Sea and East African coast to Japan, Tahiti and Australia. It is found in turbid but calm waters, on upper reef slopes and in shallow lagoons at depths down to . Biology The polyps of Pavona cactus extend their tentacles at night to catch plankton. They also benefit and obtain nourishment from the intracellular zooxathellae. These use energy from the sun to turn simple substances into complex carbohydrates and the coral makes use of the surplus nutrients. The algae benefit from being in a protected, well-lit environment well clear of the seabed and by receiving nitrogenous waste from the coral. Pavona cactus can reproduce sexually or asexually. In sexual reproduction, gametes are released into the sea where fertilisation takes place. The egg hatches into a free-swimming planula larva that settles on the seabed when it has completed its development. Here it undergoes metamorphosis to become a coral polyp which buds repeatedly to start a new colony. Another method by which colonies may increase in number is by fragmentation. If a bit of coral that has broken off a parent colony becomes wedged in a suitable position, it can continue to grow and reproduce by budding to form a new colony. Status Although this coral is common and has a wide range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists this species in its Red List of Threatened Species as being \\"Vulnerable\\". Under adverse conditions, such as a rise in sea temperature, this coral may expel its zooxanthellae and become bleached. It is then much more susceptible to disease. Coral reefs in general are under threat from a decline in the quality of the habitat through mechanical damage, pollution, sedimentation, ocean acidification and global warming and Pavona cactus faces another threat in that it is collected for the aquarium trade.

Deen dayal upadhyay, DDU), Gaya etc. go through the station. The station consists 8 platforms. The first passenger train in eastern India ran from Howrah to Hooghly on 15 August 1854. The track was extended to Raniganj by 1855. The Howrah‚ÄìBardhaman chord, a shorter link to Bardhaman from Howrah than the Howrah‚ÄìBardhaman main line, was constructed in 1917. Burdwan-Katwa line was upgraded from NG to BG in 2014 (up to Balgona) and extended up to Katwa in 2018. Barddhaman RRI It has Siemens interlocking and it was commissioned on 2014. New route relay interlocking (RRI) has considerably increased train punctuality. Electrification Electrification of Howrah‚ÄìBurdwan main line was completed with 25 kV AC overhead system in 1958. Earlier, electrification started (on the Howrah-Bandel sector) with 3 kV DC overhead system in 1953. The Howrah‚ÄìBardhaman chord was electrified in 1964‚Äì66. Bardhaman‚ÄìKatwa line was electrified in 2014 (up to Balgona) and 2018 (up to Katwa jn) Amenities Bardhaman railway station has one two-bedded non-AC retiring room and an eight-bedded dormitory. Barddhaman railway station has two two- bedded non-AC retiring rooms and one four bedded non-AC dormitory. The whole station platforms are given with high speed WIFI access provided by Google and RailWire. Also the station has escalator service in platform number 2, 3 and 8. Automated ticket vending machines are there at both side of the station where tickets can be got both by giving cash, using card, UTS mobile system etc. Vendors are available with various types of food at the station platforms. Purified and cold water is available at platforms. Bardhaman Coaching & Wagon Depot Bardhaman Coaching & Wagon Depot can maintain passenger trains EMU and MEMU, including one DEMU rake. It has a capacity of holding 71 coaches. Diesel & Electric Loco Shed Bardhaman has a diesel loco shed with WDG-3A, WDM-6, WDM-2 and WDM-3A locos. Recently BWN DLS has been electrified. 15 WAG 9 locomotive from ELS Kalyan and 10 WAG 9 locomotive from ELS Gomoh are transferred to BWN. It has parking slots for EMUs  Incidents  On two different dates, April 6 and 13 of 2003, employees of a private security agency fired at fleeing coal thieves, injuring a passerby and on the later date, a hawker. Following these incidents, a large mob comprising the station's hawkers and residents of the area, clashed with police forces leading to a baton charge and arrests, on April 14, 2003. On Friday, 9 November 2019, several people were injured in a stampede over a footbridge at the station. On Saturday, 4 January 2020, a major portion of the main entrance gate of the railway station collapsed, injuring several people. Construction activities were taking place at the site of the accident.

Springer-Verlag: Berlin; Heidelberg, Germany. The sole species is Astianthus viminalis.David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. It is known by the common names achuchil in Mexico and chilca in Guatemala and Honduras.Alwyn H. Gentry. 1992. \\"Bignoniaceae: Part II (Tribe Tecomeae)\\". Flora Neotropica Monograph 25(part 2):1-373. Astianthus is native to Mesoamerica, from southern Mexico to Nicaragua. It is a shrub, or if larger, a tree of varying height, occurring mostly along streambanks from sea level to in elevation. Its leaves are unusually long and slender, resembling those of a willow, possibly because it is a rheophyte.  Description  The following description is excerpted from one that appeared in Flora Neotropica. * Trees or shrubs, 2-20m tall. * Leaves in whorls of 3, simple, linear, 6‚Äì30 cm long and 0.3-1.4 cm wide; midrib prominent; secondaries numerous, strongly ascending. * Inflorescences terminal, paniculate, the lateral branches in whorls of 3. * Calyx campanulate, 5-dentate, the teeth 1-3mm long. * Corolla yellow, 4-5.5 cm long, tubular to infundibuliform, base of corolla narrowly tubular. * Stamens didynamous. * Gynoecium 2.5‚Äì3 cm long; the ovary glabrous, its base surrounded by a nectariferous disk. * Fruit fusiform, terete, glabrous, 3‚Äì8 cm long; the septum perpendicular to a false septum, the combined structure cruciform in cross section. * Seeds small, borne perpendicular to the septum and parallel to the false septum, the seed body sharply demarcated from the wing.  Taxonomy  The genus Astianthus was erected by David Don in 1823, in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal.Astianthus in International Plant Names Index. (see External links below). Don named its sole species Astianthus longifolia.David Don. 1823. \\"Description of five new genera of plants, [Chilopsis, Astianthus, Delostoma, Stenolobium, Jacaranda], belonging to the natural order Bignoniaceae\\". Edinburgh Philosophical Journal 9:262. He was apparently unaware that Karl Sigismund Kunth had previously named this species Bignonia viminalis in 1819.Karl Sigismund Kunth. 1818. Bignonia viminalis page 132. In: \\"Bignoniaceae\\" pages 132-159. In: Nova genera et species plantarum :quas in peregrinatione ad plagam aequinoctialem orbis novi collegerunt /descripserunt, partim adumbraverunt Amat. Bonpland et Alex. de Humboldt ; ex schedis autographis Amati Bonplandi in ordinem digessit Carol. Sigismund. Kunth ... volume 3. (See External links below). (The authority for this name is often cited as \\"HBK\\" instead of \\"Kunth\\". It is not clear why Alwyn Howard Gentry gives the date of the name as 1819.) William Hemsley transferred this species to Tecoma as T. viminalis in 1882, recognizing that the specific epithet of Kunth had priority over that of Don by the rules of botanical nomenclature.William B. Hemsley. 1882. Biologia Centrali-Americana; or, Contributions to the Knowledge of the Fauna and Flora of Mexico and Central America. edited by Frederick Ducane Godman and Osbert Slavin. Botany. volume 2, page 497. published by R.H. Porter. London. (See External links below). The name Astianthus viminalis is often accredited to Henri Ernest Baillon in volume 10 of his Histoire des Plantes, but the reason for the citation is not self-evident upon viewing page 44 of this work.Henri Ernest Baillon. 1888. Histoire des Plantes 10:44. (See External links below). Older works have usually placed Astianthus in the tribe Tecomeae, but the circumscription of that tribe was greatly revised in 2009.Richard G. Olmstead, Michelle L. Zjhra, L√∫cia G. Lohmann, Susan O. Grose, and Andrew J. Eckert. 2009. \\"A molecular phylogeny and classification of Bignoniaceae\\". American Journal of Botany 96(9):1731-1743. Astianthus is now usually placed in Bignoniaceae incertae sedis. Alwyn Howard Gentry called Astianthus \\"a very isolated genus with no obvious affinities\\" and further wrote that \\"the superficial resemblance to Chilopsis is apparently due to parallel evolution for the same type of riparian site\\". Astianthus has not yet been sampled for DNA in a molecular phylogenetic study.  Uses  Where Astianthus approaches its largest size, useful lumber can be produced from it, but it is rarely harvested by lumberjacks.Samuel J. Record and Robert W. Hess. 1940. \\"American timbers of the family Bignoniaceae\\". Tropical Woods 63:9-38. As with almost every plant, medicinal value has been alleged, but no verifiable evidence of efficacy has been observed. Isolated compounds and a crude extracts from Astianthus have failed to show any antimicrobial activity. They also showed no cytotoxicity for tumor cells.Laura Alvarez, Margarita N√∫nez, Ma. del Carmen P√©rez, Maria Luisa Villareal, and Guillermo Delgado. 1994. \\"Chemical and Biological Study of Astianthus viminalis\\". Planta Medica 60(1):98.  Phytochemistry  The pentacyclic triterpenoids ursolic acid and oleanolic acid have been extracted from Astianthus. So have cinnamic acid, p-methoxycinnamic acid, and stigmasterol. A chloroform-ethanol gradient elution High-performance liquid chromatography system was used to extract the iridoid glycosides campenoside and 5-hydroxycampenoside.  Bibliography  * Paul C.

Army Officer, Diplomat, Educator  Husayn Fawzi Al-Najjar was born on November 16, 1918 in Egypt. He was graduated in 1940 from Fu'ad Al Awwal University (now Cairo University), where he studied History. That same year, he graduated from the Royal Military College - Reserve Forces. His class of graduates were the first from the Reserve Forces to become army officers, as this Reserve Force system had just been introduced. He also attended the Institute of Journalism and the Institute of Education at Fuad Al Awal University. From 1941‚Äì1942, he embarked on a career as an army officer and saw active service in both World War II and the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. (cite sources) From 1950 to 1954, he taught national history at the Royal Military College. In 1952, he played an active role in the Egyptian coup d‚Äô√©tat. From 1954 to 1961, he undertook a diplomatic role and, on the recommendation of Defense Secretary Marshal Mohamed Ibrahim. He also became the Head of Media for the League of Arab States. He later became an adviser to the Ministry of Education. In 1957, he completed his doctorate in journalism at Cairo University with first-class honors. At the same time he gained practical experience on the newspaper that had been founded by Ahmad Lutfi Al Sayyid, \\"Al Jarida.\\" He was regarded as an authority on historical matters on this pioneering newspaper. He later wrote a well-known book, Lutfi al-Sayyid, the Teacher of a Generation (Lutfi al-Sayyid Ustadh al-Jil). He was a disciple of Ahmad Lutfi Al Sayyid and Muhammad Husayn Haykal, the latter recognizing the young Husayn Fawzi Al-Najjar as having the makings of an outstanding historian . Indeed, Haykal wrote the introduction to Husayn Fawzi Al Najjar's book \\"Policy And Strategy In The Middle East,\\" (1950) regarding it as a pioneering work in that field. Al-Najjar was becoming a leading figure in the field of policy and strategy in the Middle East and was a Lecturer on those subjects in the Military Staff College until 1954. In 1958, he was awarded a Post-doctorate Fellowship degree from Harvard University in Political Science. Activities Although he officially retired in 1973, Dr. Al Najjar carried on his teaching work at various institutions, including Cairo University and Al Azhar University. He was also a human rights advocate and a founding member of the first registered body for human rights in Egypt, Jam\`iyyat Ansar Huquq al-Insan fi Misr. With a small number of like- minded intellectuals such as Tewfik Al Hakim and Yusif Al Sebaie, he also helped found the Writers' Union (Ittihad al Kuttab). From 1994 until his death in 2003, Dr. Al Najjar suffered from a long illness that prevented him from continuing his scholarly work and activities. Variation in spelling of Dr El Naggar's name *Hussein, Husayn, Husain *Fawzi, Fawzy *El-Naggar, Al Najjar, Naggar, Najjar Publications Dr. Husayn Fawzi Alnajjar wrote over 55 books during his lifetime. As a critic and evaluator of the Islamic State concept, he wrote a number of books the best known being AL Islam wal Siyasah and Al Dawlah Wal Hukm Fi Al Islam For his theory on the Egyptian personality, he wrote Lutfi AL Sayid Wal Shakhsiya al Misriya.

It was produced by a National Research Council committee, chaired by Gerald North, at the request of Representative Sherwood Boehlert as chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science. These reconstructions had been dubbed \\"hockey stick graphs\\" after the 1999 reconstruction by Mann, Bradley and Hughes (MBH99), which used the methodology of their 1998 reconstruction covering 600 years (MBH98). A graph based on MBH99 was featured prominently in the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), and became a focus of the global warming controversy over the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. It was disputed by various contrarians, and in the politicisation of this \\"hockey stick controversy\\" the New York Times of 14 February 2005 hailed a paper by businessman Stephen McIntyre and economist Ross McKitrick (MM05) as undermining the scientific consensus behind the Kyoto agreement. On 23 June 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, with Ed Whitfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, wrote joint letters referring to issues raised by the Wall Street Journal article, and demanding that Mann, Bradley and Hughes provide full records on their data and methods, finances and careers, information about grants provided to the institutions they had worked for, and the exact computer codes used to generate their results., Hunting Witches\\".; . Boehlert said this was a \\"misguided and illegitimate investigation\\" into something that should properly be under the jurisdiction of the Science Committee, and in November 2005 after Barton dismissed the offer of an independent investigation organised by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Boehlert requested the review, which became the North Report. (NYT). The North Report went through a rigorous review process, and was published on 22 June 2006.. It concluded \\"with a high level of confidence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries\\", justified by consistent evidence from a wide variety of geographically diverse proxies, but \\"Less confidence can be placed in large-scale surface temperature reconstructions for the period from 900 to 1600\\". It broadly agreed with the basic findings of the original MBH studies, which subsequently been supported by other reconstructions and proxy records, while emphasising uncertainties over earlier periods. The principal component analysis methodology that McIntyre and McKitrick had contested had a small tendency to bias results so was not recommended‚Äîbut it had little influence on the final reconstructions, and other methods produced similar results.. Outline  At the request of the U.S. Congress, initiated by Representative Sherwood Boehlert as chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, a special \\"Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Past 2,000 Years\\" was assembled by the National Research Council to quickly prepare a concise report. The NRC Committee, chaired by Gerald North, consisted of 12 scientists and statisticians from different disciplines. Its task was \\"to summarize current scientific information on the temperature record for the past two millennia, describe the main areas of uncertainty and how significant they are, describe the principal methodologies used and any problems with these approaches, and explain how central is the debate over the paleoclimate temperature record to the state of scientific knowledge on global climate change.\\" The NRC report went through a rigorous review process involving 15 independent experts. The report provided a summary and an overview, followed by 11 technical chapters covering the instrumental and proxy records, statistical procedures, paleoclimate models, and the synthesis of large scale temperature reconstructions with an assessment of the \\"strengths, limitations, and prospects for improvement\\" in techniques used. Publication and press conference The NRC committee's report (the North report) was published on 22 June 2006. Committee member John Michael Wallace said that \\"Our conclusion is that this recent period of warming is likely the warmest in the last millennium\\", and added that \\"This doesn't change the scientific landscape in terms of the greenhouse warming debate\\". (Boston Globe). At a press conference, held on the same day, clarifications were given by three members of the NRC committee science panel: Gerald North, the statistician Peter Bloomfield and ice sheet/borehole specialist Kurt M. Cuffey. = NRC report summary= In its summary, the NRC committee noted the development of large- scale surface temperature reconstructions, especially MBH98 and MBH99, and highlighted six recent reconstructions: , , , , and . Its main findings were; 20th century instrumentally measured warming showed in observational evidence, and can be simulated with climate models, large-scale surface temperature reconstructions \\"yield a generally consistent picture of temperature trends during the preceding millennium\\", including the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, \\"but the exact timing and duration of warm periods may have varied from region to region, and the magnitude and geographic extent of the warmth are uncertain.\\" It concluded \\"with a high level of confidence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries\\", justified by consistent evidence from a wide variety of geographically diverse proxies, but \\"Less confidence can be placed in large- scale surface temperature reconstructions for the period from 900 to 1600\\", and very little confidence could be assigned to hemispheric or global mean surface temperature estimates before about 900. The NRC committee stated that \\"The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1,000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators\\". It said \\"Based on the analyses presented in the original papers by Mann et al. and this newer supporting evidence, the committee finds it plausible that the Northern Hemisphere was warmer during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period over the preceding millennium\\", though there were substantial uncertainties before about 1600. It added that \\"Even less confidence can be placed in the original conclusions by Mann et al. (1999) that 'the 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium' because the uncertainties inherent in temperature reconstructions for individual years and decades are larger than those for longer time periods and because not all of the available proxies record temperature information on such short timescales.\\" It noted that \\"Surface temperature reconstructions for periods prior to the industrial era are only one of multiple lines of evidence supporting the conclusion that climatic warming is occurring in response to human activities, and they are not the primary evidence.\\" At the press conference, North said of the MBH papers that \\"we do roughly agree with the substance of their findings. There is a small disagreement over exactly how sure we are.\\" All three from the NRC committee panel said it was probable, though not certain, that current warming exceeded any previous peak in the last thousand years. When asked if they could quantify \\"less confidence\\" and \\"plausible\\", Bloomfield explained that their wording reflected the panel's scientific judgements rather than well defined statistical procedures, and \\"When we speak of 'less confidence' we're more into a level of sort of 2 to 1 odds, which IPCC, they interpreted 'likely' as that level, roughly 2 to 1 odds or better.\\" =MBH99 and controversy= The NRC report said that the MBH99 study had attracted considerable attention because of its conclusion that recent decades were the warmest in the northern hemisphere in 1000 years, and \\"Controversy arose because many people interpreted this result as definitive evidence of anthropogenic causes of recent climate change, while others criticized the methodologies and data that were used.\\". Chapter 11 of the report described MBH98 as the \\"first systematic, statistically based synthesis of multiple climate proxies\\", and noted that the MBH reconstructions \\"were the first to include explicit statistical error bars\\". The report's overview section said that, despite the wide error bars, the hockey stick graph \\"was misinterpreted by some as indicating the existence of one 'definitive' reconstruction with small century-to-century variability prior to the mid-19th century\\". When questioned about who had said MBH99 was definitive when the paper itself emphasised the uncertainties, North said his opinion was that, \\"The community probably took the results to be more definitive than Mann and colleagues originally intended.\\" Kurt Cuffey said the context was that the MBH work \\"...was really the first of its kind,\\" and had generated debate in the normal process of science where ideas are put forward then challenged over time. The IPCC 2001 report had been careful to give the two-year-old paper's conclusion fairly low confidence as \\"likely\\" at 2 to 1 odds, but use of the graph as a visual had created a misleading impression that this research was more resolved. The graph had been used as a visual in several places, including the IPCC summary for policymakers. =MBH statistical methods= Various criticisms of the MBH statistical methods were discussed in Chapter 11, in the context of more recent research that explored ways to address these problems, and showed greater amplitude of temperature variations over 1000 to 2000 years. Recent papers cited included . On McIntyre and McKitrick's criticism of principal component analysis as tending to bias the shape of the reconstructions, it found that \\"In practice, this method, though not recommended, does not appear to unduly influence reconstructions of hemispheric mean temperature\\", and reconstructions using other methods were qualitatively similar. Some of the criticisms of validation techniques were more valid than others, these issues and the effect on robustness of the choice of proxies contributed to the committee's view of increased uncertainties. They called for further research into methods and a search for more proxies for earlier periods. At the press conference the three NRC panellists said they found no evidence supporting the allegations of inappropriate behaviour such as data manipulation, or \\"anything other than an honest attempt to construct a data analysis procedure\\". Bloomfield as a statistician considered all the choices of data processing and methods to have been \\"quite reasonable\\" in a \\"first of its kind study\\". He said \\"I would not have been embarrassed by that work at the time if I'd been involved in it\\". In response to a question from Edward Wegman on the MBH use of principal components analysis, Bloomfield said this had been reviewed by the committee along with other statistical issues, and \\"while the issues are real, they had a very minimal effect, not a material effect on the final reconstruction.\\" Responses The U.S. House Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert issued a statement on the day of publication: \\"I think this report shows the value of Congress handling scientific disputes by asking scientists to give us guidance. The report clearly lays out a scientific consensus position on the historic temperature record.\\" He noted that the report raised no doubts about global climate change or the legitimacy of any paper, and concluded that \\"The report does show, unsurprisingly, that scientists need to continue to work to develop a more precise sense of what global temperatures were between the beginning of the last millennium and about 1600. Congress ought to let them go about that work without political interference.\\" (statement). In an opposing statement Senator Jim Inhofe said that \\"Today's NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‚Äòhockey stick' is broken. Today's report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.\\". Al Gore commented that Inhofe and other deniers \\"will seize on anything to say up is down and black is white.\\". =Blog responses on the day of publication= A group-authored post on RealClimate, of which Mann is one of the contributors, said \\"the panel has found reason to support the key mainstream findings of past research, including points that we have highlighted previously.\\". Similarly, Roger A. Pielke, Jr. said that the National Research Council publication constituted a \\"near-complete vindication for the work of Mann et al.\\";. McIntyre's blog Climate Audit published a review of the report by Hans von Storch, Eduardo Zorita and Jesus Rouco, who said that it supported their view that the MBH methodology was questionable.. =News coverage= On the day of publication, the Associated Press highlighted the panel's finding that \\"recent warmth is unprecedented for at least the last 400 years and potentially the last several millennia.\\"; . In an article titled \\"Science Panel Backs Study on Warming Climate\\", Andrew Revkin of the New York Times wrote that \\"A controversial paper asserting that recent warming in the Northern Hemisphere was probably unrivaled for 1,000 years was endorsed today, with a few reservations, by a panel convened by the nation's pre-eminent scientific body.\\" Next day, the BBC News coverage on 23 June 2006 headed \\"Backing for 'hockey stick' graph\\" said the report \\"largely vindicates the researchers' work, first published in 1998.\\". The Boston Globe reported that the panel had concluded that the evidence presented in the hockey stick graph was \\"probably true\\". The Wall Street Journal story, written by the same reporter whose announcement of the McIntyre and McKitrick 2005 paper had featured on its front page, had the muted headline \\"Panel Study Fails To Settle Debate On Past Climates\\" for a piece on an inside page, which said the panel found that the key conclusion of MBH99 \\"is 'plausible' but not proved.\\". (WSJ). =Further discussion= On 28 June 2006 Nature reported the outcome as \\"Academy affirms hockey-stick graph. But it criticizes the way the controversial climate result was used.\\". The article said that the NRC panel had \\"concluded that systematic uncertainties in climate records from before 1600 were not communicated as clearly as they could have been\\". In a letter to Nature on August 10, 2006, Bradley, Hughes and Mann pointed out that this had been a comment made by North at the press conference, and was not stated in the report. The original title of their 1999 paper (MBH99) was \\"Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium: inferences, uncertainties, and limitations\\", and it had concluded that \\"more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached\\". They said that \\"the uncertainties were the point of the article\\", and that it was \\"hard to imagine how much more explicit\\" they could have been about the uncertainties surrounding their work. They suggested that \\"poor communication by others\\" had led to the \\"subsequent confusion\\".. At the Wegman Report hearings in July 2006, Gerald North testified that, \\"Dr. Wegman's criticisms of the statistical methodology in the papers by Mann et al. were consistent with our findings,\\" referring to the NRC report that found that the methodology did not have an undue effect on the graphs. In his view, \\"None of the statistical criticisms that have been raised by various authors unduly influence the shape of the final reconstruction. This is attested to by the fact that reconstructions performed without using principal components yield similar results.\\". In a debate in the United States House of Representatives on 2 December 2009, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said that the National Academies NRC report had discredited Mann's theory and shown the \\"hockey stick\\" graph to be incorrect. This was disputed by John Holdren, the president's science adviser, who said that although the panel had found minor issues with Mann's methods, they had confirmed his results. When the question was subsequent put to the NRC panel chairman Gerald North, he agreed with Holdren and said \\"The conclusions that we came to were essentially the same as the hockey stick,\\" and the scientific conclusion that the world was warming was independent of Mann's research.

The main technological impediment to widespread utilization of cellulose for fuels is still the lack of low-cost technologies to convert cellulose. One solution is the use of organisms that are capable of performing this conversion. Development of such organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is capable of secreting high levels of cellobiohydrolases, is already underway. Cellobiohydrolases are exoglucanases derived from fungi. The systematic name is 4-beta-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase (non-reducing end). Function This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction: : Hydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose and cellotetraose, releasing cellobiose from the non-reducing ends of the chains CBH1 from yeast, for example, is composed of a carbohydrate binding site, a linker region and a catalytic domain. Once the cellulose chain is bound, it is strung through a tunnel-shaped active site where the cellulose is broken down into two-sugar segments called cellobiose. The structure of the enzyme can be seen in the first figure. The second figure shows the activity of the enzyme, and shows both cellulose binding to the enzyme, as well as the product of this step, cellobiose. Research suggests, however, that the activity of CBH1 is very strong inhibited by the product, cellobiose. Determination of an enzyme that is not as strongly inhibited by the product or finding a way to remove cellobiose from the environment of the enzyme are just more examples of the many challenges that face the use of these enzymes for the creation of biofuels. CBH1 Structure, generated using pymol CBH1 zoomed in on the active site where cellulose is cleaved into cellobiose, generated using pymol. After above step, the process for creating ethanol is as follows: 3\\\\. Separation of sugars from other plant material. 4\\\\. Microbial fermentation of the sugar solution to create alcohol. 5\\\\. Distillation to purify the products and produce roughly 9% pure alcohol 6\\\\. Further purification to bring the ethanol purity to roughly 99.5% Some notable improvements have been made in this area as well. For example, a strain of yeast capable of producing its own cellulose digesting enzyme has been developed, which would allow the cellulose degradation and the fermentation steps could be at once.Galazka, M.

Born in Ballarat, Ash Lieb began exhibiting art at eight years of age, and at the age of fifteen, wrote his first novel, The Secret Well.Kane Martin, \\"A Critical Companion to The Secret well\\", Reverie Press, Canada, 2016 Throughout his career, Lieb has created a diverse range of artworks, books, short films, and comedic performances, which have often possessed philosophical or psychiatric undertones.Adam Greenberg, \\"Surreal pop : the art of Ash Lieb\\", Cherry Street Books, Toronto, Canada. 2016 History Old shoe (1990‚Äì1996) Ash Lieb's artistic career began in July 1991 at the Ballarat Civic hall site when, at eight years of age, he held his first solo exhibit Old Shoe. The exhibit was composed of drawings and paintings of lost objects and fragments of human forms. By the age of eleven, Lieb had held a total of five solo exhibitions and was involved in countless group exhibitions around Australia.James Willow Jr, \\"The art and times of Ash Lieb\\", University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. September 2016 Page 5 In 1994, Lieb contracted a debilitating illness which lasted into his first year of high school at Damascus College. In 1995, a tumour pressing on his spinal cord was discovered and removed at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital.Elliott Willow, \\"The Meaning of Life\\", Cruel World, 2011 The Secret well and Bleach (1998‚Äì2000) At the age of fifteen in 1998, Ash Lieb wrote his first novel The Secret Well.James Willow Jr, \\"The art and times of Ash Lieb\\", University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. September 2016 Page 7 The story, set in the aftermath of the mysterious disappearance and grim discovery of young girl's body, is about a young girl and her mysterious neighbour who soon come to unravel the terrifying secrets around them. Lieb dedicated the story to his childhood friend who had died years earlier. In 1999, at the age of sixteen, Ash Lieb wrote his second novel Bleach over several months while skipping English classes at his high school, which he felt was wasting his time. The story is about an alienated anarchist looking for an escape from the emptiness of high-school, who, after a chance meeting with a girl, is put on a collision course with a fate even his darkest thoughts never imagined. Lieb's books can be found on every populated continent of the world, with stores holding them in more than fifteen countries. The Technicolor Transgressions of the Blue Rose (2001‚Äì2004) After completing high school, Ash Lieb enrolled in a visual arts degree at Ballarat University. However, by the age of nineteen, he had left the course after his vision began to deteriorate and he began to suffer from headaches and anxiety.Dellaram Vreeland, \\"Ash adds a third string to his bow\\", The Courier, Tuesday 2 July 2013 page 16 ISSN 1037-0374 In the summer of 2003, it was discovered that these issues were brought on by an aggressive clear cell meningioma.Hailey Wood, The Courier, Saturday 26 January 2013 page 33 ISSN 1037-0374 With an uncertain future, Lieb went on to write his third novel, The Technicolor Transgressions of the Blue Rose, in the weeks leading up to having dangerous brain surgery that he was convinced he wouldn't survive.William S. Guggenheim, \\"The Holy Grail\\", Cruel World, December 2013 page 8 The Technicolor Transgressions of the Blue Rose is a story about a color blind thief with a fictional form of color blindness, where everything yellow is seen as blue, which was inspired by the artist's own form of red-green color blindness.William S. Guggenheim, \\"The Holy Grail\\", Cruel World, December 2013 page 2 In the story, characters have blue hair, the sun is blue, gold coins are blue, and so on. The Meaning of Life (2005‚Äì2012) Lieb returned to university in 2005, where he began to create his art in a digital style, combining his previous skills in drawing and painting with photography and other new techniques. However, in 2007, despite the favorable conditions of the surgery he underwent in 2003, Lieb required further surgery and radiation therapy, whilst undertaking the final year of his visual arts degree in digital art. In 2009, having been writing jokes for almost a decade since his final year of high school in 2000, Lieb performed on stage for the first time while living in Brisbane. The following year, having returned to Ballarat, Lieb performed his surreal humor and one-liners at the Geelong Performing Arts Centre and Fitzroy's Evelyn Hotel to mass crowds.Chloe Biggin, \\"ASH LIEB\\", The Courier, Saturday 29 June 2013 page 34 ISSN 1037-0374 A year later, having only ever previously exhibited his drawings and paintings, Lieb exhibited his digital artworks for the first time in his solo exhibition The Meaning of Life in April 2011.\\"Exhibition has youthful appeal\\" The Courier, Tuesday 29 March 2011 page 12 ISSN 1037-0374 The imagery in the exhibit was a collection that spawned out of the artist's surreal humor that he credits Woody Allen and Mitch Hedberg for having inspired in his youth, while the title of the exhibit is an allusion to the absurd humor of Monty Python. In 2012, Ash Lieb was honored as one of the city of Ballarat's 40 people under 40, and as a leader in the industry.Kim Quinlan, The Courier, Wednesday, 26 December 2012, front page ISSN 1037-0374 The Holy Grail (2013‚Äì2014) The beginning of 2013 saw Ash Lieb open his exhibition How not to be seen at a small gallery in the artist's home town of Ballarat. The both humorous and philosophically surreal exhibit dealt with the dual meanings of absurdism.James Willow Jr, \\"The art and times of Ash Lieb\\", University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. September 2016 page 3 A few months later in April, Lieb released his first joke book Funny Guy after more than a decade of writing and performing his absurdist style of humour. In October, Ash Lieb unveiled his exhibition of The Holy Grail. The philosophically absurd exposition dealt with such concepts as the meaning of life, philosophy, existentialism, vision quests and animal spirits.William S. Guggenheim, \\"The Holy Grail\\", Cruel World, December 2013 page 6 The artist's artwork Weyekin also featured in the Blake Prize for spiritual art Director's Cut exhibition throughout the beginning of 2014.William S. Guggenheim, \\"The Holy Grail\\", Cruel World, December 2013 page 9 The Blake Prize 2013, retrieved 24 January 2016 Art Lieb's art and style of humour deals in the absurd. While one part deals with the laughter, nonsense and ridicule of absurdity or surreal humour, the other deals with the philosophical definition of absurdism regarding the conflict between pursuing the meaning of life and the inability to find it.Dellaram Vreeland, \\"Meaning of life explored through art\\", The Courier, retrieved 19 December 2013Dellaram Vreeland, \\"Exploring the world and the heavens\\", The Courier, Tuesday 15 October 2013, pg17 ISSN 1037-0374Jack Pilven, \\"Local artists take a look at time factor\\", The Courier, Tuesday 6 July 2010 page 12 ISSN 1037-0374 Lieb's digital works were initially inspired by artists such as Woody Allen and Andy Warhol. His style consists of complex pop surrealist digital montages using photographs and images. Examples of themes in his works include a recurring milk carton, medical stitches, and corporate brand names.Harry Brumpton, The Courier-Mail, retrieved 13 April 2013 Much of the artist's imagery and characters are, to some degree, a recreation of the bizarre imagery that the artist experiences during brief spells of derealisation that occurs during short temporal lobe seizures that first appeared as a result of a brain tumour in the early 2000s. This warped d√©j√† vu dreamlike imagery extends throughout much of the artist's anthology of creations.James Willow Jr, \\"The art and times of Ash Lieb\\", University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. September 2016 page 4 Comedy Inspired by the comedians that he watched when he was younger, Ash Lieb began writing jokes when he was still in high school at the age of 16.Erik Smith, \\"Absurdists: The surreal comedians\\", Luminary books, Canada, May 2016 In 2009, after refining his style and humour for many years, Lieb performed at open mic spots for the first time while living in Brisbane.Chip Lewis, \\"Wit: the humour of Woody Allen, Mitch Hedberg, Ash Lieb, Groucho Marx and Steven Wright\\", Wayward Classics, New Zealand, July 2016 In February 2010, at the age of 27, Ash Lieb made his professional stage debut at the Geelong performing arts centre, where comedian Rod Quantock introduced him to a jubilant mass crowd. Quantock would later declare, \\"It was truly hilarious and brilliantly original comedy.\\" Blending his observations with techniques, such as absurdity, wordplay, non-sequiturs and paraprosdokians, Lieb's wit is always calculated, smart and original. Consisting of concise jokes and one-liners, Lieb's act is distinguished by the manner of speech he adopted early in his career, his abrupt delivery, and his peculiar stage presence. Lieb is a unique and original writer and performer, and is often a wildcard. Adam Greenberg once wrote, \\"In shows where every performer is the same, Ash Lieb is the needle in the haystack.\\" Much like the humour of Woody Allen, Lieb often makes light of intellectuals, especially those with somewhat absurd or impossible claims: \\"Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity in the 1680s. Before then, there were people floating all over the place, and cats and dogs and little old ladies went missing all the time!\\" Lieb's first collection of short humorous essays and one-liners was published in 2013. Literature The literature of Ash Lieb has been influenced by authors such as Charles Dickens and Daniel Keyes, and like the work of Dickens and Keyes, Lieb's literary style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.Ella Teller, \\"The someday book club - Volume 1\\", Nightfall Press, New Zealand 2016 The narrative voice within Lieb‚Äôs stories often becomes a meaningful motif within the narrative, where repetition of certain lines or words within the story is a common characteristic of his style. This is often achieved by usage of anaphora, a rhetorical device where words are repeated for emphasis. In Lieb‚Äôs story The secret well the recurring word \\"old\\" is used as a motif in such a way as to suggest that the character is growing up, getting old and leaving all behind that is her youth. In recognition of Charles Dickens‚Äô influence, Lieb‚Äôs character Sara Charlie Dickens from his story The secret well was named in his honour. Lieb‚Äôs stories are often a mixture of fantasy and realism, and often fall within the genres of absurdist or transgressive fiction.Trey Whitman, \\"Transgressive fiction\\", Bent books, New Zealand 2016 Lieb‚Äôs characters often feel marginalised or confined by the norms and expectations of society, and so they often break free or act out in self-destructive ways. Art and literature critic Trey Whitman once wrote, \\"Lieb's literature encompasses the nihilism of the grunge generation and the iconoclasm of the beat generation to form an anarchy filled madness that swells throughout the pages like the way drunken insects must fly.\\" The usage of eye dialect in The Technicolor transgressions of the blue rose was inspired by the story Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes. In Keyes' story, Charlie's narration begins filled with spelling errors and awkwardly constructed sentences, but after a procedure to improve his intelligence, the narration advances with improved accuracy in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and word choice. The character's regression is later conveyed by the loss of these skills.Andrew Bujalski, \\"Flowers for Algernon: Daniel Keyes\\", Spark pub, 2002 page 21 Andrew Bujalski, \\"Flowers for Algernon: Daniel Keyes\\", Spark pub, 2002 page 15 Lieb's use of eye dialect has drawn comparisons with such writers as Irvine Welsh, who is known for having written phonetically in his native Edinburgh Scots dialect within the story Trainspotting, and also Hubert Selby Jr, who phonetically deployed street slang, common speech, argot and scatology in the story Requiem for a Dream.

John's mother and thus William's grandmother was Charlotte Sophie of Aldenburg, the ruler of Aldenburg 1738‚Äì1748. She was the cousin to the mother of Catherine the Great and had good connections to the Russian court. Probably William also had a good relation with Duke George of Oldenburg who was referred to as a prince in Russia. Captain John Bentinck (1737‚Äì1775) and his son, William Bentinck (1764‚Äì1813), by Mason Chamberlin. He married Frances Augusta Pierrepont in 1802 and together they had eight children, but only four survived to adult age. His oldest son George Bentinck (1803‚Äì1886) became an MP.  Navy service  At the age of nineteen he was given the command of the 50-gun (September 1783 to January 1784) during the end of the American War of Independence. Shortly after the peace with USA, a part of the crew deserted and escaped to land on Sandy Hook. A cutter was sent after them but they ran aground on a salt march and the crew together with its commander Hamilton Halyburton died of exposure to the cold. Logbooks written by Bentinck has been preserved from a journey with from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, July‚ÄìAugust, 1784.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1787.  Later career   Governor of St. Vincent and the Grenadines  He was the Governor of St. Vincent and the Grenadines during the years 1798‚Äì1802. During this time he made some journeys as a partial log exists with sailing instructions for a number of North American and West Indian harbours, February‚ÄìJuly 1800, written by Bentinck.  Promotion to admiral  In 1802 he married and probably moved back to England. In 1805 he was commanding the Sea Fencibles from Cromer to Fosdyke Wash which was close to his estate. The Sea Fencibles was a coastal defence force that would defend against any invasion from France. During the following years he was rapidly promoted first to Rear-Admiral of the Blue in 1805, then Rear-Admiral of the White in 1808 and finally Vice-Admiral of the Blue in 1810. Little is known about his commands during these years.  Peace negotiations with Sweden and Russia 1812  The Treaty of Orebro on 18 July 1812 marked the end of both the Anglo-Russian and the Anglo-Swedish Wars. The French armies was at the same time advancing into Russia and it was necessary to end the wars and instead create a union against France and its allies. Bentinck had family connections in the Russian court and he also seems to have had a good relation to the Swedish Crown Prince Carl Johan Bernadotte. He made several journeys between St Petersburg and Stockholm. He took initiative to the meeting in August at the city of √Öbo between Tsar Alexander I and the Swedish Crown Prince Bernadotte. It is not known if he had a mission from the British government or if he acted on his own. The US ambassador in St Petersburg John Quincy Adams writes to the Secretary of State James Monroe in August 1812: > \\"A circumstance not a little extraordinary is, that the conclusion of peace > with England, if accomplished, has not yet been made public. An Admiral > Bentinck was at the Emperor Alexander's headquarters, dispatched, it is > said, by Admiral Saumarez from the British Fleet in the Baltic, to which he > has again returned.
