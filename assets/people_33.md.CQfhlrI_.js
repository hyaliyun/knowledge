It is therefore possible for clubs from some countries to take part in multiple levels of competition in the same season. Clubs usually qualify for European competitions through performance in their national or regional leagues, with exception of wild cards.  Continental competitions  Since the FIBA–EuroLeague dispute, there are currently four different competitions which are branded as Europe-wide, two controlled by Euroleague Basketball, and two by FIBA Europe. Clubs which compete in these competitions also play in their national and/or regional leagues. Clubs usually qualify for these competitions based on their performance in the national or regional leagues in the previous season. The EuroLeague is the Euroleague Basketball's premier competition, and each year involves clubs from 10 countries. The EuroCup is the Euroleague Basketball's secondary level competition, and currently made up of 24 teams from around Europe. Clubs from over 30 countries have taken part. The two finalists of the EuroCup qualify to the EuroLeague next season. The Champions League, which began in 2016, is the FIBA Europe's premier competition. Initially, FIBA had intended to replace the EuroLeague, but this was rejected by the clubs involved. The Champions League involves 32 teams. To date, clubs from over 20 countries have taken part. The Europe Cup is the FIBA's secondary level competition. 32 teams compete, and the teams which did not enter in the Champions League regular season have the option to drop down into the regular season of the Europe Cup. As of 2019, clubs from over 30 national federations have taken part. The names of the various European and regional club competitions have frequently changed over time.

The ABA League, commonly called the Adriatic League, began in 2001, and consists of clubs from the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia). At different times, the league has also included clubs from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Israel. Clubs generally also compete in their own national leagues in the same season, after the conclusion of the ABA League season. The winner of the league qualifies for the next season's EuroLeague. The VTB United League is made up of mostly Russian clubs, as well as a smaller number of clubs from nearby countries - currently Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Kazakhstan and Poland. It serves as the top division of the Russian national league system. One club from the league qualifies for the next season's EuroLeague, in addition to CSKA Moscow, which holds a EuroLeague license. Other multi-national leagues in Europe have included the Baltic Basketball League (2004-2018), the Central European Basketball League (2008–2010), and the Balkan International Basketball League (began in 2008). National leagues Each country generally has its own league system, with various divisions which involve promotion and relegation, as well as playoffs following the regular season. The Spanish Liga ACB is generally considered to be the highest quality national league in Europe, and contributes at least four clubs to the EuroLeague each season. Other leagues among the strongest include Russia's VTB United League, Turkey's BSL, the Greek Basket League, Italy's LBA, and the LNB Pro A in France.

Slushflows are caused when water reaches a critical concentration in the snowpack due to more water inflow than outflow. The high water concentration weakens the cohesion of the snow crystals and increases the weight of the snowpack. A slushflow is released when the component of the force of gravity parallel to the slope generates a hydraulic pressure gradient exceeding the tensile strength and basal friction of the snowpack. While frequently compared to an avalanche, they have some key differences. Slushflows are lower in frequency than avalanches, have higher water content, are more laminar in flow, and have lower velocity. They most commonly occur at higher latitudes in the winter during high precipitation and in the spring during high snowmelt. Because of their high water content, they can flow down gentle slopes of only a few degrees at low altitudes. They are a significant hazard in Norway and IcelandUS National Research Council (1990) Snow Avalanche Hazards and Mitigation in the United States National Academies Press pg 12 and are responsible for the deaths of dozens of people as well as the destruction of buildings and the closure of roads.

Photographed in the Ministers' Building (The Secretariat), Yangon. A typical 240-volt electric wall clock produced by Gents' of Leicester, dating to approx. the late 1960s Gents' of Leicester, also known as Gents & Company Limited, was established in Leicester, England, in 1872 by John Thomas Gent. For over a century, the company was a well-known manufacturer of electrical equipment, in particular its electric clocks, which were used in public buildings and railway stations all over the world. Products The company also produced fire alarm systems, electric bells, transformers, telephones, signalling and recording equipment, and electrical parts for aircraft communications and radar equipment. The company had a workforce of several hundreds at its height. Some of its well known fire alarm products include the Model 1102 manual call points, which came with a small hammer attached to a chain. The extremely loud Warbler sounders were used in many schools around the United Kingdom. The original Warbler had three selectable tones: warble, continuous and intermittent and also had adjustable pitch and speed dials. The later models were considerably quieter and included the addition of a sweep tone, without the pitch or speed controls. Protec also copied their design. Many warblers have since become collectible items because many have been scrapped and replaced by newer fire systems. The 2510 and 2511 sounders were then produced, the latter being common across many schools and manufactured until 2003. The Model 1500 sirens were also often used on older fire alarm systems, sounding very similar to air raid sirens. Location Its main design and manufacturing centre and headquarters were at the Faraday Works in Temple Road, Leicester; but after World War II, the company expanded into nearby Kibworth.'Memories of Gent’s Electrical Equipment Manufacturing in Kibworth' Kibworth History Society. A premises at London Road was also used at this time. In the early 1990s a new large building was constructed in the Hamilton area of Leicester and the other buildings were all closed. Takeovers In 1981, Gents' of Leicester was taken over by the international organisation Chloride, and was known as \\"Chloride Gent\\". In 1982, the company was sold by Chloride to the MK Electric Group, and was then known as \\"Gent Limited\\". The factory at Kibworth closed, and only a few jobs remained at the central Leicester works. In 1993, the company was acquired by Caradon/Novar; and in 2005, it was taken over by Honeywell, and has been known as \\"Gent by Honeywell\\" since.

They are found mainly in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, in western Asia and northern Africa. C. lucasina can be distinguished from other members of the carnea-group of the genus Chrysoperla by subtle and variable morphological attributes. Adults can be encountered from late Spring through mid-Autumn. They are polyphagous, feeding on pollen and nectar of various herbaceous flowering plants (mainly Brassicaceae, Graminaceae, Apiaceae, and Asteraceae), as well as on honeydew, their preferred diet in Autumn. After the feeding period, they fly near colonies of aphids, where they breed and the females lay eggs. Unlike the adults, the larvae are fearsome predators; consequently, these insects are used for the biological pest control of aphids and other small arthropods. The adult insects hibernate in winter.

Wiki-Watch conducted and published a survey of administrators of German Wikipedia and blogs regularly about German Wikipedia problems. Wiki- Watch's site wiki-watch.org provides statistical insights on Wikipedia. Part of Wiki-Watch.org is a free software application for page analysis. This tool automatically assesses the formal reliability of Wikipedia articles in English and German. It produces a five-level evaluation score corresponding to its assessment of reliability. Second, its \\"Exclusive Insight\\" shows what is occurring in Wikipedia in nearly realtime. The Wiki-Watch blog spots current trends in Wikipedia and is a source of news coverage about the Wikipedia project. Wiki-Watch was developed at the Viadrina European University in Frankfurt an der Oder, Germany. The development team included professors Wolfgang Stock and Johannes Weberling.  Wiki-Watch's formal page analysis  Wiki-Watch's formal analysis relies on tracking each entry made in a Wikipedia article. It checks the number of sources, the number of editors and the number of links to the article. Within the additional implemented WikiTrust each editor is also given a \\"quality score\\" that assesses the reliability of their edits. Hundreds of thousands of editors have contributed Wikipedia entries and the reliability of the information within Wikipedia has been the subject of debate among experts. Since 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation had been considering marking text that had not been reviewed or edited by multiple editors as \\"untested\\". This form of reliability checking could enhance acceptance of scholarly Wikipedia content within educational establishments. Text tracking has incorporated into the WikiTrust system, in ongoing development at the University of California Santa Cruz and implemented in Wiki-Watch. Specific text fragments that have not been edited by multiple authors with a good score are flagged as potentially unreliable or unsafe.dpa: Wiki-Watch-Projekt wird fortgesetzt - Stock legt Leitung nieder of 7 September 2011. The reliability and reputation scoring system uses a color code scheme to evaluate pieces of text, based on the edit history and number of revisions by users, thereby signaling what may be unreliable changes within an article. The reliability of each editor is assessed by reviewing the changes they have made to various articles, and tracking their contributions to see how well the contributions survive after edits by other editors. The page analysis is comparable to WikiBu with some differences. WikiTrust is more detailed than WikiBu. Wiki-Watch stresses more the quality of sources, while WikiBu stresses more the quantity of views over sources. Wiki-Watch is aimed at media professionals, while WikiBu is aimed on pupils and teachers.  \\"Exclusive Insight\\"  In \\"Exclusive Insight\\" Wiki-Watch shows a compact overview of current Wikipedia developments (What and Who). Users can choose views between one hour and one month. A logged-in user can see more detailed statistics: most read pages, new pages, most edited pages, and so on. Additionally, graphs are supplied for the most read pages, displaying each day's views so that the reader sees if interest in an article is rising or ceasing. The \\"Exclusive Insight\\" displays edit wars and deletions, as well as the activities of administrators and power editors. Criticism of co-founder In July 2011 the newspaper published articles describing an alleged conflict of interest between co-founder Wolfgang Stock's work for Wiki-Watch and his work for a pharmaceutical company that was a client of his agency Convincet. – article was taken offline after Weberling and Stock announced legal action. The FAZ had to print a formal reply: Gegendarstellung zum Beitrag \\"Schon Großmutter war zuckerkrank\\" vom 11.7.2011. by Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Stock, written on 1 August 2011. – article was taken offline after Weberling and Stock announced legal action Stock had last made edits to Wikipedia articles in the area of pharmaceuticals and health issues in spring 2009, which was one year before founding Wiki-Watch (late 2010) and two years before the accusation (July 2011). In a formal reply in Der Spiegel, Stock refuted the allegations, calling them \\"wrong\\" and \\"false\\". Stock claimed that he had made his edits of entries related to a pharmaceutical company \\"before my consulting work for the pharmaceutical company.\\" By his own admission, Stock's edits derived from personal interest and concern and were not paid by anybody. Only later, from summer 2009 on, he had worked as a communications consultant for the pharmaceutical company. \\"Given the ongoing legal dispute\\" on the accusation, Stock gave up his leadership position of Wiki-Watch and his access rights to its Internet platform, but remained a team-member in September 2011. The Viadrina European University called the allegations \\"demonstrably false\\".

It was released in October 2011 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Microsoft Windows, and, for the first time, iOS. As the thirteenth installment in the NBA 2K series, it is the successor to NBA 2K11 and the predecessor to NBA 2K13. For the first time in the series, three different covers are available; the three cover athletes are Michael Jordan (who was also the cover athlete for NBA 2K11), Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird. This was the last installment in the series to be released for the PlayStation 2. NBA 2K12, like the other games in the series, strives to emulate the experience of the National Basketball Association. Players mainly play NBA basketball games in a variety of game modes with real and customizable players and teams. MyPlayer mode is one of the modes; in it, players create their own player and play through their career in the NBA. A mode called Association is also present, in which the player assumes control of an NBA organization, and simulates through seasons. A mode focusing on past NBA players is introduced, and several online modes are present. In September 2011, prior to the game's release, a demo was released for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. The game features a licensed soundtrack consisting of 28 songs. A contest was held before the game's release, the winners of which would collaborate on an original song to be featured in the game. NBA 2K12 received positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, wealth of content, controls, and overall gameplay. By April 2012, the game had sold over four million copies worldwide.  Gameplay  NBA 2K12 is a basketball simulation game which strives to emulate the National Basketball Association. Players mostly play NBA basketball games with real or created players and teams. The game features several aesthetical details found in real televised NBA games, such as commentary from Kevin Harlan, Clark Kellogg, and Steve Kerr, sideline reports from Doris Burke, halftime shows, replays, customizable camera angles, and other details.Sarkar, Samit (September 10, 2015). \\"NBA 2K16's broadcast team gets bigger and a bit weirder\\". Polygon. Retrieved December 6, 2016. Along with standard online and quick play game modes, several other game modes are present. Association mode allows the player to assume control of an entire NBA organization, simulating through NBA seasons, managing personnel, and participating in off-season activities, such as the draft and free agency. MyPlayer mode returns, in which the player creates their own basketball player. The player customizes the appearance, animations, and other aspects of their player, and plays through their basketball career, upgrading their attributes. One of the game's most-touted features is the \\"NBA's Greatest\\" mode. The mode centers on past NBA teams and players, and allows the player to recreate historically significant moments. The mode features such teams as the 1986–87 Los Angeles Lakers, with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and others, the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan, and the 1984–85 Philadelphia 76ers, featuring Julius Erving and Moses Malone. The teams and players can be used outside the \\"NBA's Greatest\\" mode. Another mode is \\"Create a Legend\\"; similar to the MyPlayer mode, it allows the player to play through the entire career of a real player, instead of a customizable player. The player can play with their selected player on any team and will start as a rookie.Good, Owen (August 18, 2011). \\"NBA 2K12 Delivers Much More than 15 Legends in an Ensemble Cast of Greatness\\".

It was originally published as a one-shot in December 2010, and later began serialization in the March 2011 issue of Shueisha's Jump Square magazine. It concerns a young student who visits a shrine in Kyoto and meets a beautiful childlike female-looking warrior who invites him to fight supernatural enemies. The manga is licensed in English in North America by Dark Horse Comics. Plot Gate 7 follows Chikahito Takamoto, a secondary school student whose strong interest in history brings him to Kyoto, where he meets a beautiful childlike warrior named Hana, who fights supernatural enemies with the aid of Tachibana and Sakura, two young men with magical powers of their own. The trio of Hana, Tachibana, and Sakura are members of the Urashichiken Hanamachi, a secret society dedicated to waging battle against otherworldly creatures that appear in Kyoto. As Chikahito soon learns, the Urashichiken's battles go back to the Sengoku era in Japan, when warlords and other key figures attempted to defeat their rivals by forming blood contracts with powerful spiritual beings known as Oni. Since then, many of masters of the Oni have reincarnated in the present, with the Urashichiken's current leader being the reincarnation of Toyotomi Hidetsugu, and they struggle to find the long-missing body of Oda Nobunaga in order to obtain the most powerful Oni of all. Chikahito inexplicably finds himself in the midst of the otherworldly spaces where the battles are fought as he begins his new life in Kyoto. Characters=Main characters ; :A beautiful, childlike warrior, Hana wields special powers, helping them fight supernatural enemies. They invite Chikahito to live with them and the two men who accompany them, Tachibana and Sakura. In the beginning of the series, they kiss Chikahito upon meeting him, although it was revealed later by Sakura that they had actually cast a spell on him that made the two of them reunite in the near future. When not in battle, Hana is a seemingly normal child with a fondness for noodles. In truth, Hana is neither male, nor female. Little is actually known about Hana. ; :A shy, young boy in his second year of high school, Chikahito takes a sightseeing trip to ancient Kyoto, his dream being that he wishes to live there. While wandering in the grounds of the legendary Shinto shrines of Kitano Tenman-gū, Chikahito stumbles upon a mystical realm to find a beautiful young person named Hana and their comrades, Tachibana and Sakura. His immunity to their powers reveals that he isn't the only ordinary one there. He is welcomed by Hana to live with them, Tachibana, and Sakura. Chikihito is a good cook, and is very knowledgeable of Kyoto and famous historical figures of Japan. ; :The mysterious, handsome, and often ruthless, Tachibana is a companion of Hana, and a university student. His name, Tachibana, means wild orange, the same kind of tree that is famous for being of the south side of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Often acting like an older brother to Hana, he is protective of them and is often worried about them. He appears annoyed at the presence of Chikahito, addressing him as an \\"ordinary human\\" upon meeting him. Like Hana and Sakura, he fights the supernatural beasts by summoning elements. His motives for fighting for the Urashichiken are to save his twin sister, , who was abducted by Iemitsu Tokugawa, the third shogun of the Tokugawa Dynasty. Tachibana has the ability to summon Yang weapons for Hana. ; :Another of Hana's companions and Tachibana's partner, Sakura is a gentleman who also assists in fighting Hana and Tachibana's supernatural enemies. His name, Sakura, means cherry blossom, the tree that is famous for being on the south side of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Like Tachibana, he cares a lot about Hana and their well being. He will often tease Chikahito, making Chikahito question Hana's gender. Though he teases him, he appears much more welcoming toward Chikahito than Tachibana. When in battle, Sakura is in charge of making the borders surrounding the dimension in which they fight in. In his everyday life, he works as a male attendant for geiko and maiko. Sakura has the ability to summon Yin weapons for Hana. Historical figures ; :The first reincarnation of a famous Japanese historical figure introduced, Hidetsugu appears to a calm person, who gets along quite well with people. He visits his own grave, and reveals his Oni, Mikoto. ; :The main antagonist who wants to locate the body of Oda Nobunaga and claim his Oni, which is believed to be the most powerful of all. Having the appearance of a young, androgynous boy with purple eyes, he approaches Chikahito and enrolls in his school under the name of Yuu Aoi. He has the habit of allowing his Oni to feed on humans. ; :An ally of the Urashichiken residents, his Oni, Kurikara, takes the shape of a sword stored inside the body of his companion Kojūrō. He dotes a lot on Hana and does not contain his love for them, much to the others' annoyance.

The country has also produced several world-class boxers, including Azumah Nelson a three-time world champion, Nana Yaw Konadu also a three-time world champion, Ike Quartey, and Joshua Clottey. Daniel Kotei Poison is the first Ghanaian to win a World Title. Cricket  Cricket was handed over to Ghana in the early days of then the Gold Cost during the rule of its colonial masters the British and played its first international game against Nigeria in 1904. It is known that after the 2nd World War the game grew from there and spread through expatriates and further local citizens in the mining sector. The game between the 1960s and 1980s saw the involvement of schools and colleges notably in the Greater Accra, Central, Western and the Eastern Regions of Ghana. The spread caught the attention of the Universities, Training Colleges and Communities vibrantly. By 1993 talents were identified at the grassroots to form the juvenile teams taking part in the Cricket Quadrangular among the North West Africa Cricket playing countries at that time. Ghana became an Affiliate Member of the ICC in 2002 and the game has continued to grow since. INTERNATIONAL The country competed in the ICC/ACA Division 3 of the ICC Africa World Cricket League in 2006 for the first time. Its third-place finish was hugely encouraging and it followed that up by winning the following event – in 2008 in South Africa – to gain promotion to ICC/ACA Africa Division 2. Ghana more than held its own in the 2010 ICC Africa World Cricket League Division 2 held in Benoni, South Africa in April as it finished in second place to maintain its spot for the next event. A record of just one defeat in six matches – that to title winners Zambia – augurs well for the future. It was no surprise that Ghana became a force to reckon with in the 2011 edition of the ICC/ACA Africa Regional Division 2 T-20 Tournament placing second to gain promotion to the Africa Regional Division 1 event in Uganda the same year and also gained a Promotion to play at ICC Global Division 8 in 2012. However first time appearance in the ICC/ACA Africa Regional Division 1 T-20 Tournament was evident as the team placed fifth out of the five countries event in Uganda. Ghana showed its capacity to hold international events when it successfully hosted the ICC/ACA Division 3 T- 20 in Accra in February 2011. With increased Government support for the lesser known sports, the establishment of cricket in schools is underway via a vibrant national cricket development programme and plans are afoot to establish more cricket grounds. DOMESTIC STRUCTURE The GCA supervises the Accra Invitational League, Captain Series, The Diwali League, Girls Quadrangular Competitions and Interschool's Cricket Competition.

It was introduced to numbers of the young pioneers club of Ghana. During this same time, some French expatiates working with CFAO open a dojo at their office in Accra. In 1960 Mr. Tony Turkson now a reverend minister opened a club in Accra at the National Arts Centre. Two other clubs were later opened at the police and Army training schools. In 1973, a Japanese mission was in Ghana through the sponsorship of the Japan foreign ministry to demonstrate the art of Judo to Ghanaians. In 1974, the Japanese Mission sent another delegation as part of a cultural exchange programme. During this same period, three army personnels were sent to Britain for three months training. Two other police officers were sent to Kodokan, Japan for two years. Upon these happenings the Ghana Judo Association was formed. From the year 1974, Judo has become a recognized national sports and has developed over the years. Organizations such as Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Japanese Embassy in Ghana as well as the French Embassy have helped in the development of the sports in the country. From 1976 – 2002, eleven Japanese coaches have helped the Ghana Judo Association to develop Judo. Some Ghanaians have also gotten the chance to study abroad. Two Ghanaians namely Andy Williams and Schandorf were in Egypt for 10 months and 6 months respectively. Over the years five Ghanaians have also been to Japan to study judo through the sponsorship of JICA. In 2003, another Ghanaian had a three-month study in Germany. In 2005, under the Olympic solidarity scholarship, another judo player was sent to Hungary for three months. At the moment judo is being practiced in may part of the country as many people from all walks of life are enrolling daily to take judo lesson for self-defence, as a sport and to keep them fit. Handball The Game of HANDBALL started in Ghana in 1975 by Mr. S. K. Hlordze then Deputy Chief Sport's Organizer of the National Sports Council and Mr. Katé Caesar, then a visiting lecturer at Specialist Training College – P. E Department, Winneba, now and the University of Education. The German Government donated a quantity of equipment to be used in establishing the Sports College among the items was a number of Berg – Handballs. Mr. Katé Caesar organized the first Handball Clinic at the Osu end (Car Park) of the Accra Sports Stadium with the support of Mr. S. K. Hlordze and the assistance of the Missodey Brothers i.e. Emile and Gabriel who were very proficient in basic Handball skills. They had then been recognised trainers of the National Sports Council. The clinic was over one week aimed at introducing basic skills in the game to Physical Education students during the Easter break in April 1975. Later in the year Gabriel and Emile Missodey, supported by Mr. S. K. Hlordze formed the first handball team in Ghana based in Osu [Great Fingers International Handball Club]. In September 1977 some player from Fingers International most of them residing around Kaneshie started training at the Kaneshie Sports Complex and eventually formed Hostac Handball Club, it was from these two that other teams were formed. The Handball Association of Ghana was formed in 11 November 1976 with Mr. Katé Caesar as the first Chairman. The first International competition in Handball took place in Accra in May 1977 between Ghana and Togo with the return encounter in Lome -Togo two weeks later, the National Team at that time were students from Specialist Training College - Winneba. In 1976, the Ghana University Sports Association included Handball in their Competitions but lack of basic infrastructure kept the game on hold until quite recently that all the major Universities have embraced it i.e. Legon, Cape Coast, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology University of Education – Winneba and University of Development Studies. In July 1977, during the National Sports Festival, Handball was included and the teams that took part included Gt. Accra, Central Region, Armed Forces, Eastern Region, Ashanti Region Volta Region, Northern, Region and Brong Ahafo Regions. Due to the high performance of Greater Accra, they had the chance of playing Ogun State in Accra which Greater Accra won. In 1978, Ghana played Cote de voire in Africa Zone three elimination. The Security Services took up the Game in the 1980s onwards. After Mr. Katé Caesar, in 1978 Mr. B.T. Baba became the Chairman till date. Ghana handball is currently of age, some of it coaches have benefited from advanced coaching courses in University of Leipzig in Germany. Referees from Ghana have been officiating in international competitions around the Africa continent. Ghana won Bronze Medal at Commonwealth Youth Championship held in Minna – Nigeria in 1992. She also won Bronze Medal at the 7Th All African Games held in Johannesburg – South Africa in 1999. In August 2006, Ghana's women's National Team won the African Challenge Trophy [Africa Cup] held in Lome – Togo. Due to lack of sponsorship, handball League is only organized in Greater Accra. Currently there are ten (10) male teams and six (6) female teams participating in the Greater Accra Handball League. There are other teams around the country like Kpando Young hands from Volta Region and Globe Trotters from the Northern Region. Handball has also become part of the Basic and Second Cycle Schools Sports Calendar, with all Senior Secondary Schools playing the game seriously, especially in Greater Accra Region. THE WAY FORWARD Since 1977, the game has not seen much infrastructural growth and Development. Apart from the Ghana Prisons Service and the Ghana Armed Forces which can boast of good concrete open courts, not much can be said of structural development in the Regions though the game is now being played at the first and second cycle level all over the country. There is the need to look for other means to develop the Game, therefore the quest to look for assistance in the form of structural and Technical development i.e.: 1 A modern Indoor Facility that could be used for Commercial purpose with sitting capacity of Ten Thousand (10,000) Spectators. Such a facility could cater for other games i.e. Volleyball, Basketball, Table Tennis, Gymnastics, Judo and Boxing Tournaments. Karate The sport was first introduced to the country in the 1990s which is run by the Ghana Karate Do Association. Netball The game of Netball which developed from WOMEN BASKETBALL was introduced into the then GOLD COAST by the MISSIONARIES who brought education into the country. Netball was therefore initially played in schools and colleges in Ghana. In the 1960s and 1970s Netball was very popular in the country and regular Netball competitions were played in schools and colleges across the country with the finals being held at the then Accra Sports Stadium now OHENE DJAN SPORTS STADIUM. Good exponents of the game of Netball in those days- the early 1970s were Kadjebi Secondary School (Snr. High School), Offinso Training College, Wesley College Kumasi and Osu Presby Secondary Schools (Snr. High School) and the basic school level. Netball was also very popular and up to the 1974/75 academic year, Netball was included in the National Basic Schools sports festival programme regularly. During the era of the Central Organization of Sport(C.O.S) under the era of Ohene Djan, he established a Desk at the C.O.S in charge of Netball, which liaised with the schools and Colleges Sports Federation for the organization of Netball tournaments and the promotion of Netball in the country. Table tennis Esther Lamptey, in 2019. Table Tennis had long started in the 1940s. However, history of organized Table Tennis in Ghana can be traced from the arrival of D. G. Hathiramani, an Indian trader in the Gold Coast. D.G Hathiramani, a good player himself, teamed up with other enthusiastic Gold Coast local players like Dr. S.B Laing, J.W Mullings, E.N Nettey and many others to form the Gold Coast Table Tennis Association in 1951. Hathiramani captained the Gold Coast team to win the AZIKWE CUP in Lagos, Nigeria. About three years later, Hathiramani retired as an active player and took to coaching. In 1954, Hathiramani established a table tennis school at the Accra Y.M.C.A (Young Men Christian Association). He produced a lot of good players. Some prominent ones included E.A Quaye, Okine Quaye, Samuel Hammond, Joseph Quansah, Ethel Jacks, Theresa and Ernestina Akuetteh, Helena Amankwah, Esther Lamptey, Patricia Akosua Offei and Patience Abena Opokua. All these players won medals for Ghana. Ghana joined the African Table Tennis Federation (ATTF) in 1951 and the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) in 1961. Okine Quaye won the Kent (England) Junior Table Tennis Tournament in 1960. In the same year E.A Quaye captured the Kent Senior Tournament. In 1962, E.A Quaye won the Africa Men's Singles title in Cairo. However, E.A Quaye lost the title in 1964 in Accra, Ghana, but regained it in 1968 in Lagos. E.A Quaye underwent a table tennis Basic Coaching Course in Britain in 1961 and in Beijing Institute of Physical Education in 1965. Another prominent player of D,G Hathiramani was a half Ghanaian and half Nigerian. This young lady troubled the Nigerian team greatly. ETHEL JACKS was the name. Ethel Jacks won many laurels for Ghana and herself between 1964 and 1976 at Africa and West Africa Championships. In 1971, Ethel Jacks won the Africa Women's Singles title. After 1976 Ethel Jacks left Ghana for Nigeria and later became a coach for Nigeria. In 1977, the GTTA and the NSC organized a one –week intensive Table Tennis Coaching Course for all regional coaches. The coaches were housed in D.G Hathiramani's house. At the end of the course, table tennis equipment were given out to all participants. Hathiramani was affectionately called “D.G”. Until 1977, there were only two (NSC) National Sports Council paid coaches namely: E.A Quaye, in charge of the Western Region, and S.K. Allotey who was in charge of the Ashanti Region. On 1 January 1978, Vincent Arhin, a Physical Education Assistant Superintendent teacher of the Ghana Education Service was appointed a Regional Coach to the Eastern Region. He therefore became the third National Sports Council (NSC) coach. In December 1980, Esther Lamptey won the Africa Women's singles title in Senegal. In 1981, the first Africa Table Tennis Coaches Intermediate course was organized under the tutelage of Mrs. Sung Meiying, the Technical Director of China Table Tennis Association and the patronage of the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation. The Eastern Region Coach, Vincent Arhin and the B/Ahafo Region Coach, Anthony Asante participated on behalf of Ghana. In 1985 an agreement reached between the Ghana Government and the China Government enabled Coach Vincent Arhin and a former national player, Anthony Owusu Ansah to be offered scholarship to do an advance Diploma Coaching Course in Beijing, China at the University of Physical Education. In 1986, Coach Owusu Ansah was appointed a National Sports Council Coach to the Ashanti Region.

In March 1988, Ghana won Gold Medal by beating Nigeria in the Women's Team Event (Corbillon) at the Africa Zone 3 Games held in Ghana. The team was handled by Coach Vincent Arhin and the players were Patricia Offei and Patience Opokua. In the same year, table tennis became an Olympic event. Ghana was represented by Patricia Offei, Coach Arhin, Sqd. Ldr. Ebo Bartels (Chairman), Ernestina Akuetteh (Chaperon) and Patience Opokua (Training Partner for Patricia Offei) in Seoul, South Korea at the 24th Olympic Games. After the World Table Tennis Championships, Stephen Adjei and Patricia Offei failed to return to Ghana. That sparked off public outcry and brought about a decline of the Ministry's interest in table tennis until 1992 when Helena Amankwah and Patience Opokua featured at the 25th Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. Coach S.K. Allotey (deceased) and the leader of the team, Kwabena Yeboah of GTV fame, were in attendance. The Ghana Education Service (GES) and the National Sports Council jointly organized a National U-10 table tennis and soccer training programmes for children in Accra for 3 months.

The Academy was inaugurated by the Deputy Minister of Sports, Mr. Sylvester Azantilo, under the direction of the Ag. Chief Executive of NSC, Brigadier Brock. In 2001, the Academy played friendly matches with the Togolese national team on “home and away” basis. In each case, the Academy was victorious. The sponsors were Next Door Restaurant, Mr. Kudjoe Fianoo and Mr. Richard Quarshie, both members of the Ghana Football Association. In 2002, to stop favouritism, nepotism and tribalism in the selection of national players for international assignments, the Chief Coach, Mr. Arhin introduced the POINT SYSTEM. This was accepted by both the Association and the playing body. That enabled the Black Loopers to train constantly to win for the first time in Twenty (20) years a BRONZE medal in the Men's Team Event at the 8TH All Africa Games in Abuja, Nigeria in 2003. In March 2003, Ghana participated in the 47th World Table Tennis Championships in Paris, France. Nana Yaw Boateng, Eric Amoah and Eric Hammond were ranked 897, 898 and 899, respectively.

Criticism In the past, Ghana's sports authorities have often cut the funding for many sports disciplines in order to ever increase the funds available to its football (soccer) programs. Because of this decision, several sports events on the African continent such as the African Games have seen limited Ghanaian participation.Ghana Basketball Association - Ghana government fails to support Ghana Women's Team in Mali, Sportingpulse.com, 24 September 2011.

Based on the USN's F-11 Tiger, the F11F-1F did not proceed beyond the two F11F-1F prototypes. Design and development As an improvement to the F11F-1 (F-11A) fighter, Grumman proposed a more advanced version of the airframe known as the F11F-1F Super Tiger. This was the result of a 1955 study to fit the new General Electric J79 engine into the F11F airframe. The Navy was sufficiently interested to authorize modification of two production F11F-1s with enlarged air intakes and YJ79-GE-3 turbojets, with the result being designated the F11F-1F, indicating a production F11F-1 with a special engine fit. The aircraft first flew on 25 May 1956, reaching Mach 1.44 in one of the flights. After the addition of 60° wing root fillets, a 13.5 in (35 cm) fuselage extension, and an uprated J79 engine, the F11F-1F reached an impressive Mach 2.04 in 1957, thus becoming the first naval aircraft in the world to exceed Mach 2 (two years before the F4H, F8U-3, and A3J). This was a surprise even to Grumman, which had expected a top speed of only Mach 1.4 at altitude.Buttler 2008, pp. 114–115. By comparison, the F11F-1 with the Wright J65 had had difficulty exceeding Mach 1.1. However, the U.S. Navy did not order the Super Tiger into production. Although the service ceiling of the aircraft was nominally 59,000 feet, a test flight on 18 April 1958 at Edwards AFB set a world altitude record of 76,939 feet. Operational history=Marketing efforts Edwards AFB, 1958. Having failed to secure the Navy contract, Grumman marketed the Super Tiger to foreign customers. The Super Tiger outperformed the Saab Draken, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, Dassault Mirage III, and Fiat G.91 in a tender to equip the Swiss Air Force. The Mirage III was finally chosen as a cheaper and more secure alternative, yet a close second in terms of performance.\\"Die Besten: Supertiger und Mirage III (The Best Ones: Supertiger and Mirage III) .\\" Schweizer Luftwaffe.

In order to interest the Germans, Grumman proposed a 10,500 lbf Rolls-Royce Avon installation instead of the J79.\\"P.1 German Demonstration.\\" Flight, 31 January 1958, p. 130. The German Air Force, Japan Air Self Defense Force, and Royal Canadian Air Force showed considerable interest but eventually the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter was chosen. This outcome, however, was marred by the Lockheed bribery scandals, in which huge sums were paid by Lockheed to influential politicians in those countries to ensure the adoption of the Starfighter.Baugher, Joe. \\"Grumman F11F-1/F-11A Tiger.\\" Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia of American Military Aircraft, 30 January 2000.

Metamec was a manufacturer of domestic clocks in the second half of the 20th century, and was based in Dereham, Norfolk, England. The name \\"Metamec\\" is derived from \\"metal-work and mechanics\\". The company started as an offshoot of the furniture manufacturers Jentique in about 1941,http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Metamec which made boxes for instruments and bombs during World War II. Products The first Metamec model was a mains- powered mantle clock numbered \\"701\\" (approx. 1947). All clocks produced by Metamec were produced to a high standard, and the factory expanded with the purchase of new machines to allow them to create their own movements, rather than import the movements in from other clock companies. The factory increased in size during the 1960s and 70s, and employed approx 750 people, producing 350 models of clock, and producing 25,000 clocks per week. They became a manufacturer of the now iconic large 'Sunburst' chrome, teak and brass clocks. Metamec was the largest clock manufacturer in the UK at the time. Decline The company declined in the late 1980s due to penetration by the German clock industry and imports from the Far East. Metamec went into receivership in December 1984 and was purchased in January 1985 by FKI of Halifax, West Yorkshire, who continued to use the name until 1993.

Some MS drafts bear differing dedications (To -- on active service or To a comrade in Flanders). The poem was probably written in Milford Camp, Surrey, which was a part of Witley Camp. The poem's title echoes a line from Revelation 21:1, \\"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth\\". The poem is written from the point of view of a soldier (or soldiers) in France wondering about death; since they have no chance of gaining entry into any mythological afterlife (or even the Christian Paradise), they call on the Channel ferry - rather than that over the Styx - to take them home and find remembrance and wholeness in their mothers' tears. Owen's biographer Dominic Hibberd draws parallels with Owen's 1917 poem \\"Anthem for Doomed Youth\\", finding a Romantic nostalgia in both which was only expunged in the later poems written at Craiglockhart and after.

Life Born at Lechlade in Gloucestershire on 20 September 1689, he was educated at Coxwell, Berkshire, and at Magdalen School in Oxford. On 7 July 1705 he was entered a commoner of Trinity College, Oxford. Having completed his course, he came to London to practise the civil law; but in 1710, on the death of his patron, Sir John Cook, dean of arches, he abandoned the legal profession and devoted himself to literary and antiquarian pursuits. In 1747 he was appointed secretary to a society for the encouragement of an essay towards a complete English history. He died of a fever on 19 April 1747, and was buried in the chapel yard of the Royal Hospital of Bridewell. His daughter was supported by Samuel Johnson; she died in 1807. Works An elegy in a book entitled Astræa Lacrimans, published anonymously in 1710, was probably written by Coxeter. In 1720 he contributed one or more of the indexes to John Hudson's edition of Josephus; and in 1739 he published a new edition of the Life of Bishop Fisher often attributed to Richard Hall, its translator into Latin.http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/library/special_collections/manuscripts/post_medieval/pmml22/ Coxeter was a collector of old English plays, and allowed the Shakespearean editor, Theobald, to make use of them. He also assisted Joseph Ames in the preparation of Typographical Antiquities. In 1744 he circulated proposals for an annotated edition of the dramatic works of Thomas May, but the scheme was never carried out. In the prospectus he said that, having determined to \\"revive the best of our old plays, faithfully collated with all the editions that could be found in a search of above thirty years\\", he \\"happened to communicate his scheme to one who now invades it\\" — the reference being to Robert Dodsley, whose Select Collection of Old Plays appeared in 1744. In the same prospectus he promised an edition (which was never published) of the works of Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst. Coxeter's manuscript collections were largely used in Theophilus Cibber's Lives of the Poets and in Thomas Warton's History of English Poetry. His statements are to be received with caution, for he invented titles of imaginary books. In 1759, a four-volume edition of Philip Massinger's works appeared, \\"collated by Mr. Coxeter\\"; it was criticised by William Gifford. Others – the Edinburgh Review in 1808, and contemporary scholars – have been more complimentary.

Hildenley stone, considered to be the best decorative stone in Yorkshire, takes its name from the site. The area is referred to in Domesday Book as Hildingeslei and was also referred to as Hieldenley. There was a holy well at the site, which was named in honour of St. Hilda. In 1565, the estate and its quarries were purchased by the navigator William Strickland, grandfather of Sir William Strickland, 1st Baronet, and the Elizabethan house likely built in the 17th or 18th century. It was built from the fine-grained peloidal limestone found on the estate that became known as Hildenley limestone. It is of extremely high quality, particularly suited for interior carving, and was used at Kirkham Priory, Malton Priory and the chapel at Castle Howard. George Strickland, of Hildenley, represented the county of Yorkshire in the British Parliament in the 19th century.London Gazette: MPs for 1831 The estate was 270 acres in the mid-19th century. The eighth baronet was a keen botanist and built a large conservatory and other structures for nature. After his death on 31 December 1909, Hildenley Hall was described thus by the Linnean Society: \\"The Hall, although not a very large building, is a comfortable residence, built in a well sheltered site at the base of a steep wooded bank of limestone formation known as Hildenley Wood, which is a relic of the ancient forest-land of Yorkshire and has never been under cultivation, and is the home of some of the rarest of our British native orchids and other rare kinds of the wild flora of Britain.\\" Sir Walter Strickland, 9th Baronet, known as the \\"Anarchist Baronet\\" for his anti-imperialist ideas, sold the estate after his father's death in 1909. It was bought by the Hon. Francis Dawnay (11 December 1853 – 26 June 1914), son of William Dawnay, 7th Viscount Downe, and demolished soon afterwards, another house replacing it.

It consists of a passenger station and a freight yard about a kilometre to the north. Both parts of the station are on the Left Rhine line (); the freight yard also has a connection via Brühl-Vochem to the Cologne port and freight railway network (Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln AG, HGK). History  Opening in 1844 Brühl station was opened on 15 February 1844 by the Bonn-Cologne Railway Company (Bonn-Cölner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BCE) on the occasion of the visit of Queen Victoria and was from the beginning the most important stop between Cologne and Bonn. The station building was built on the first single-track line in sight of the Augustusburg Palace to a design by Johann Peter Weyer. Since large parts of the line run towards the grand estates, this enabled the royal family to make its influence felt. In 1869 a second track was built, and the station building relocated to a central platform. At this time the freight yard was located just to the north on the eastern side of the line. In 1910 to 1913 there was an extensive reorganisation of the railways in Brühl. In particular, it included the construction of a embankment to enable the removal of level crossings with other transport routes. The station was on both sides of the line with a passing track and two island platforms between the main tracks and the siding, which are reached by an underpass. Since there was no longer enough room near the station for the freight yard, it was moved further north on the western side of the track. Between the two parts of the station, a bridge carried the lateral line of the Cologne port and freight railway over the Left Rhine line; this connected via a circular route to the Köln-Bonner Eisenbahnen (KBE, \\"Cologne-Bonn Railway\\") line (now line 18 of the Cologne Stadtbahn) and from Vochem a track branched off to the new freight yard. In a railway accident at Brühl on 6 February 2000, nine people lost their lives and 149 more were injured when a train running from the north on the opposite track at excessive speed ran on to the eastern siding and derailed. While the front of the train plunged down the embankment and slammed into an apartment building, the rear part of it was pulled across the platform and was crushed against a pillar supporting the platform roof. Contributing factors in the accident included the separation of the freight and passenger sections of the station along with the lack of intermediate as well as exit signals and the operations of trains on the main track in the opposite direction to normal operations. During the clean up after the accident, the siding on the eastern side was completely removed, the platform was shortened and a noise barrier was built on the eastern side. Platforms of Brühl station As part of the North Rhine-Westphalia modernisation campaign of 2006, the access tunnel to the platform was widened and the stairs were provided with wheel chair lifts. Train services The station is served by the following services: *Regional services Rhein-Express Emmerich – Wesel – Oberhausen – Duisburg – Düsseldorf – Cologne – Bonn – Koblenz *Local services MittelrheinBahn Cologne – Bonn – Remagen – Andernach – Koblenz *Local services Rhein-Wupper-Bahn Wuppertal-Oberbarmen – Wuppertal – Solingen – Cologne – Bonn – Bonn-Mehlem Bus services The only bus connection to station is line 990, running every half hour on weekdays and every hour on weekends. In the summer months there is also a private shuttle service to Phantasialand.

The Alliance has branches in the Netherlands and in Spain, where it has as main objective the international drug trafficking and massive money laundering.  Early years  The main clans composing the alliance were the Licciardi clan, Contini clan and Lo Russo clan from Naples and the Mallardo clan from Giugliano. The alliance was initiated by Gennaro Licciardi who built his clan in the early 1990s in the Secondigliano, a northern suburb of Naples.Behan, See Naples and Die, pp. 262-3 The alliance included Edoardo Contini and Francesco Mallardo, and dominated the Neapolitan underworld during the 1990s. When the three male leaders died or were imprisoned, Licciardi’s sister Maria Licciardi was left in charge of the alliance.Fiandaca, Women and the Mafia, p. 15 Under her leadership, the alliance become more organized, secretive, sophisticated and consequently more powerful.Godmother sends deadly message to her Mafia rivals, The Daily Telegraph, June 19, 2001 The reign of Maria Licciardi ran smoothly for many years without any problems, until a disagreement arose over a consignment pure unrefined heroin. In the spring of 1999, a large consignment of heroin arrived from Istanbul, Turkey. Licciardi decreed it should not be used, as it was too pure and strong for the junkies and would kill them. However, the Lo Russo clan disagreed and repackaged the shipment for sale on the streets. The sale of unrefined heroin resulted in the deaths of many drug addicts across Naples and caused great public outrage and resulted in massive police crackdowns on the Camorra clans. Many Camorristi were arrested and subsequently imprisoned.Italy's most wanted Mamma, The Guardian, June 30, 2000 The Lo Russo clan eventually split from the alliance, causing disintegration and a bloody gang war, including the use of car bombs and bazooka attacks. Clans began fighting over turf, and attempted to destroy or take other clan's business. When four clan members were murdered in her stronghold of Secondigliano, Licciardi was forced to retaliate. She mobilised her footsoldiers for an all-out counter-attack. The deadly gang wars resulted in nearly 120 deaths in Naples and the surrounding region. It was around this time that investigators became aware of Licciardi's existence. Maria Licciardi was arrested on June 15, 2001. Her brother Vincenzo Licciardi took over as a supreme head of the Secondigliano Alliance along with Paolo Di Lauro and Edoardo Contini. Licciardi was arrested on February 7, 2008.Italy, U.S. target Mafia in massive raids, The Associated Press, February 7, 2008  Current status  In June 2019, the Italian police arrested more than 120 members of the Alliance in an anti-Camorra operation. The police also confiscated €130 million. Among those who were arrested were the wives of the bosses of the Bosti, Mallardo, Licciardi and Contini clans, but also their lieutenants, children, grandchildren and entrepreneurs who worked for the alliance. The historical female boss Maria Licciardi managed to escape from the arrest in the operation. Despite the large number of police operations against it, the Alliance is still considered the most powerful organization in the Camorra. In May 2020, Patrizio Bosti, one of the most powerful Camorra bosses who is still alive and one of the leaders of the Secondigliano Alliance, was released from prison. Bosti also claimed inhumane treatment while in prison, and will be compensated by the Italian state. The Camorra boss, that was serving a prison sentence since his arrest in Spain in 2008, should have been released from prison in 2023, however he was charged for three years and the halfway between early release and the time calculated as credit for the \\"inhuman treatment\\". According to the investigations, Bosti's freedom makes the Secondigliano Aliance even stronger, considering that Maria Licciardi is also free, this allows the organization to have two of its historical leaders out of prison. On May 16, 2020, Bosti was rearrested. The new prison order concerns a recalculation of the sentence by the Emilia-Romagna judiciary, as he was serving his sentece in the region, on the basis of documents provided by the Naples Public Prosecutor. According to the authorities, Bosti has to serve another six years in jail.  Activities  The Alliance is strongly active in Spain, in fact, numerous important members of the organization were arrested in the country, such as Paolo Di Mauro, deceased in 2018, considered by the authorities one of its top associates, particularly linked to the Continis. Seven members of the organization were also arrested in Spain, Netherlands, South America and in the Balkans, places where they were running illicit business on behalf of the Alliance. The Alliance is also believed to use Santo Domingo in Dominican Republic to launder money. The group is believed by the authorities to be allied with the Commisso 'ndrina in the trafficking and sale of cocaine and marijuana from South America, via the Netherlands.

The three parts of a tax return Income: This part consists of all the sources of your revenue. Most widely known method for detailing is a form W-2 tax document. Payments, profits, independent work pay, prominence, and in various domains, capital additions should likewise be considered for. Deductions: Reasoning or deductions decline in tax debt. For organizations, most expenses specifically identified with business tasks are deductible. Citizens may separate conclusions or utilize the standard derivation for their documenting situation. When the reduction of all outcomes is finished, the citizen may decide their expense rate on their balanced gross salary. Tax credits: Duty and tax credits are sums that balanced charge liabilities or the duties owed. Like findings, these fluctuate broadly among areas. Nevertheless, there are regularly attributes credited to the consideration of kids and seniors, annuities, instruction, and some more.

Plot During an amateur boxing prizefight a young boy, Joey Parker, is beaten to death, and there is no acceptable official reason for why it happened. Because of this his sister, Mary Parker, becomes a strong opponent of boxing and all it stands for. A newspaper refuses to print the truth of what lies behind the Parker boy's tragic death, so sportswriter Wally Matson resigns in protest. The truth is that Parker was only one of many boys unscrupulously used by a boxing promoter, Joe Taggerty, who has paid off Wally's editor at the newspaper for his silence. Wally vows to clean up the amateur boxing scene by exposing the corruption. He lands a job at a small newspaper and persuades the publisher to sponsor a legitimate tournament. Wally personally invites amateur Billy Crane to participate in the tournament's opening match. Billy is in love with Parker's sister Mary, so out of consideration for her, he declines. To get Billy to fight, Wally needs to win over Mary, so he takes her out for dinner. He tells her about his tough childhood and how boxing gave hope to friends as a way of securing their futures. Billy gets her permission to enter the tournament. Taggerty is not happy, believing this new tournament started by Wally will ultimately put him out of business. Taggerty lies by telling Billy that Wally only is after his beloved Mary, and that the two of them already have been on a date. Billy is devastated. Taggerty goes even further to sabotage the tournament. He pays a professional boxer, Cliff Stanton, to enter it posing as an amateur. Taggerty's plan is spoiled when Billy is set to fight against Stanton. Inspired by Mary's vow of everlasting love for him, he beats Stanton fair and square in the fight. Taggerty's deceit is exposed, and the Golden Gloves amateur tournament wins national acclaim. Cast * Richard Denning as Bill Crane * Jeanne Cagney as Mary Parker * J.

Forbes became involved in politics and in 1860, along with Arthur Macalister and Patrick O'Sullivan, was elected to the new seat of Ipswich in the Queensland Legislative Assembly which he served until his defeat in 1863. He later served in the seat of Warrego from March 1865 to June 1867 and the seat of West Moreton from September 1868 until his retirement in November 1873. During this final term, Forbes spent two years as Speaker from 1871 to 1873.  Later life  Though Forbes declared bankruptcy in 1870 because of the 1866-67 money crisis, he managed to quickly rebuild and was able to continue investing in businesses until his death.

What's going to be the most quintessential Black Dahlia Murder thing we can do?' That's kind of what we set our foothold in.

There's more ups and downs and taking people on a journey this time.\\" Co-founder Brian Eschbach, meanwhile, credits the presence of fellow guitarist Ryan Knight, who joined the band during Deflorate, with helping to move things forward on this particular venture. \\"It's been more collaborative than it's been in years,\\" Eschbach notes. \\"The last two albums (Deflorate and 2007's Nocturnal) I wrote most of the music, and this one it's almost a 50-50 effort between me and (Knight). He lifted what we were doing on the last album so much from what we've done before, his different techniques and stylings that he knows how to wield.

It originates in the Pacific Ocean near Japan and has become an invasive species on the coasts of the Northern Atlantic Ocean. Description This siphonous green alga is of two subspecies in Great Britain and Ireland. They are similar, both are dark green in color. It forms long erect finger-like fronds. These grow to 40 cm or more long branching dichotomously. The cortex of the branches is formed by closely packed utricles, these are small cylindrical club-shaped structures formed from a single cell up to 1200 µm (micrometre) long.Burrows,E.M. 1991. Seaweeds of the British Isles. Natural History Museum, London The rounded tips of these closely packed utricles give the frond a velvety texture.Dickinson, C.I. 1963 British Seaweeds. The Kew Series, Eyre & Spottiswoode The fronds hang down from rocks during low tide, hence the nickname \\"dead man's fingers\\".Codium fragile: Dead Man's Fingers. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. 1996. The \\"fingers\\" are branches up to a centimeter wide and sometimes over 30 centimeters long. Codium fragile occurs in the low intertidal zone, and subtidal on high-energy beaches. It has no asexual (sporophyte) stage, and male and female gametes are both produced on separate plants. Subspecies Subspecies of C. fragile can only be distinguished microscopically. Codium fragile subsp. atlanticum This subspecies can be distinguished by the mucron or tip of the utricles. In this subspecies the mucron is short, no more than 20 µm long. Codium fragile subsp. atlanticum is known to have arrived in the southwest of Ireland around 1808. From there it may have spread by rafting or floating in the sea. Approximately 30 years later, it was found in Scotland. It is thought to have originally come from the Pacific Ocean near Japan. Since 1840, when it was first discovered in Scotland, it has spread the entire length of Britain, including Shetland. Between 1949 and 1955 it is known to have spread between Berwick-upon-Tweed and St. Andrews, Fife, a distance of 80 km. Populations of this algae occur mostly in northern Britain. Elsewhere in Europe it is found in several places, including Norway, the Netherlands, France, Spain and the Azores. This species displaces the native Codium tomentosum. Codium fragile subsp. atlanticum is used as food in the Far East.Codium fragile ssp. atlanticum. Joint Nature Conservation Committee, UK. Close-up Codium fragile subsp. tomentosoides This subspecies is distinguished from C.fragile subsp. atlanticum by its very pointed mucron (the tip of the urticle) – up to µm 68 long. The subspecies Codium fragile subsp. tomentosoidesCodium fragile ssp. tomentosoides. Global Invasive Species Database. ISSG.Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides. Introduced Species: Descriptions. MIT Sea Grant. (syn. Codium mucronatum var. tomentosoides), occurs along nearly the whole coastline of the eastern United States, from the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to North Carolina. It is a rapidly spreading invasive species. It originated in the Pacific Ocean around Japan, and was introduced into New York from Europe in 1957. Its presence was first recorded in 1964 in the Gulf of Maine at Boothbay. It is now recorded around Ireland.Morton, O. 2003. The marine macroalgae of County Donegal, Ireland. Bulletin of Ireland biogeography Society No 27: 3 – 164 It has also been recorded from the Scilly Isles, the Channel Islands, and the south and west coasts of England and Scotland. This is a dominant subspecies in the subtidal zone, attaching to almost any hard surface. This results in increased maintenance labor for aquaculturists and reduces the productivity of cultured marine life. In established shellfish beds, this species can become a nuisance; it may attach to shellfish and then float away, carrying the animals with it. This was the inspiration for the common name \\"oyster thief\\". Codium fragile subsp. scandinavicum This subspecies was introduced from Asiatic coasts of the Pacific to Norway, and to Denmark in 1919.  Codium fragile subsp. novae-zelandiae  This subspecies is found in the low intertidal to subtidal zones around New Zealand at the North Island, South Island, Chatham Islands, Stewart Island, Auckland Island, Campbell Island as well as around the Falkland Islands.

He appeared in more than 60 films between 1930 and 1942. Early life He was born George Ruud Hjorth to a Norwegian mother and Danish father. The family moved to California when he was two and a half years old. His father owned a restaurant in Hollywood. Acting career Hjorth began getting small parts in silent films when he was just three years old. He had a successful career as a child actor, being a member of Our Gang in 1931. He also played Roger Jones in 17 Jones Family low-budget films from 1936 to 1940 (named Roger Evers in the first movie, Every Saturday Night). However, as he grew older, roles became scarcer, so he learned from cameramen on his films and became one himself. World War II When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the United States entered World War II, he enlisted. At a friend's suggestion, he became a combat photographer and \\"one of the 17 original movie makers\\" of a special OSS photographic unit headed by noted film director John Ford. He had to sign an agreement not to discuss his wartime work for 50 years. On his first combat mission, he photographed the fighting in North Africa, followed by the invasion of Sicily and then on to the Italian mainland. He parachuted \\"into France and Germany ... to take pictures of bridges, roads, rivers, railroads and even a V-1 launch site\\". In early June 1944, he parachuted into occupied France with three film cameras without being told what he was supposed to do. The French Resistance hid him for a couple of days, then took him to the coast before dawn of June 6. He was told he would know what to film. As dawn came up, he witnessed, and filmed, the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach by the United States Army - the only known Allied footage from the German perspective. After using up all of his film, he managed to get through the American lines unharmed and returned to England. Absurdly, when the film was to be screened, he was ordered out of the room because he did not have the top secret clearance required to see it. The whereabouts of the film are currently unknown. Hjorth also shot pictures of Buchenwald concentration camp and the aftermath of an Axis atrocity in France (the corpses of dozens of civilians burned alive). Post-war He became an executive for McDonnell Douglas. When OSS files became declassified, his wartime activities came to light. Historians are searching for the film he shot, so far without success.

After his death, his few remaining adherents elected to reunite with the main Cutlerite church in Independence, Missouri. Born and raised in the Cutlerite community in Clitherall, Minnesota, Fletcher elected not to relocate with the main body when it moved the church headquarters to Independence in the 1920s. After President Emery Fletcher's death in 1953, the Independence church, which then contained the majority of Cutlerite members, elected Erle Whiting the church's new president. This was in keeping with a Cutlerite tradition that passed the presidency to the former leader's First Counselor, subject to the membership's approval. Clyde Fletcher and the Cutlerite remnant in Minnesota did not approve of this step, and Fletcher was accordingly elected president of his congregation in Clitherall, which he subsequently claimed to be the sole legitimate continuation of the Cutlerite organization. He named his church the \\"True Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)\\", and began a lengthy court battle with the Independence organization over church properties in Minnesota. A Minnesota court finally ruled in favor of the Independence church in 1966, giving it sole control over all Cutlerite properties and church records. Fletcher refused to accept the legitimacy of the Independence organization and remained at the head of his church (headquartered in the Cutlerite meetinghouse in Clitherall) until his death in 1969. To the end of his life, he continued to claim that his was the only true Cutlerite sect, and the only true church on earth. Fletcher did not change any of the distinctive beliefs of the Cutlerite church; his organization remained identical to the main body in Independence in every respect save leadership. After his death, his organization's few remaining members elected to accept an offer to return to the Independence church, which led to the folding of Fletcher's church and the end of the schism.

There he served an important role in the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the Jefferson estates, including Poplar Forest, as butler, personal valet, glazier, and painter. He was the son of Betty “Bett” Brown, the second child of Elizabeth “Betty” Hemings, the matriarch of the Hemings family in the United States. He was held in high esteem by President Jefferson as a \\"faithful servant\\" who was \\"absolutely excepted from the whip.\\" When Jefferson died on the night of July 4, 1826, Colbert was counted among those at the bedside of the former president.Monticello.org According to Edmund Bacon, chief overseer at Monticello for nearly two decades from 1806 to 1822, \\"Mr. Jefferson had a large number of favorite servants, that were treated just as well as could be. Burwell was the main, principal servant on the place.\\" Jefferson was also said to have had \\"the most perfect confidence\\" in his servant Colbert. As such, he was one of two artisans at Monticello who brought particular distinction to themselves in both the operation of the estate and the life of the master of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson. He and his cousin John Hemings were exceptional in that they were given a regular annual allowance of $20 per year, and permitted to go down to the Charlottesville stores and pick out the clothing they wanted. No one else was given this privilege. This is notable because slaves were typically given a predetermined allotment of rudimentary clothing and foodstuffs by their owner, and had no freedom of choice in the matter. Colbert was ultimately given his freedom in Jefferson's will, and bequeathed the sum of $300.00 for the purchase of tools necessary to continue working in his trade. He had married his first cousin Critta Hemings with whom he became father to eight children. In 1819, Critta died at only thirty-six years of age. Several years later in 1834, Burwell married Elizabeth Battles, a free woman of color with whom he had three daughters. In freedom, Colbert worked as a glazier and painter at the University of Virginia, of which his former master Jefferson had been the founder in 1819. Notes In 1805 President Jefferson wrote in his farm book regarding Burwell Colbert that he “paints and takes care of the house.” In his will of 1826, Thomas Jefferson wrote of Colbert: “I give to my good, affectionate, and faithful servant Burwell his freedom, and the sum of three hundred Dollars . . .” In his 1860 memoir, Monticello overseer Edmund Bacon expressed his regard for faithful Burwell saying, \\"Mr. Jefferson gave him his freedom in his will, and it was right that he did so.\\" Further reading * Pierson, Hamilton W., Jefferson at Monticello: The Private Life of Thomas Jefferson From Entirely New Materials.

The town was besieged by a combined force of Normans under Robert Fitz-Stephen and soldiers loyal to Diarmait mac Murchadha. After being ousted as King of Leinster, Diarmait had recruited the Normans to help him regain control of Leinster and the semi-independent Norse- Gaelic seaport of Wexford. Although the attackers did not breach the town's walls, Wexford surrendered after almost two days and came under Norman control. Background In 1167, Diarmait Mac Murchada had been deposed as King of Leinster () and exiled from Ireland by the High King of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair and his ally Tigernán Ua Ruairc. Diarmait was determined to regain his kingdom and become High King himself. He fled to France and asked for military aid from the Anglo-Norman King of England, Henry II. Henry authorized Diarmait to seek help from the Anglo-Norman and Cambro-Norman lords in his kingdom. Those who agreed to help included Richard de Clare (nicknamed \\"Strongbow\\") and half-brothers Robert Fitz-Stephen and Maurice FitzGerald. Fitz-Stephan was accompanied by his half-nephew Robert de Barry. Strongbow was offered Diarmait's daughter Aoife in marriage and promised the kingship of Leinster on Diarmait's death. Robert and Maurice were promised lands in Wexford and elsewhere for their services. About 1 May 1169, Fitz-Stephen landed at Bannow Bay with a force of 30 knights, 60 armsmen and 300 bowmen. The next day, Maurice de Prendergast landed at the same spot with ten knights and 60 bowmen. This force merged with about 500 soldiers commanded by Diarmait and marched to Wexford (Loch Garman). Skirmish at Duncormick On its way to Wexford, the army was confronted by Gaels or Norse-Gaels at Duncormac (Dún Cormaic). After a short skirmish, it fought its way across the river and continued northeastwards to Wexford. It is unknown what casualties were inflicted. The 1971 Capuchin Annual (page 399) argues that this skirmish \\"deserves greater respect in history than it has got\\" because it was \\"the first battle of the Norman invasion, the first attempt to stop the foreigners, the first bloody encounter in a struggle which was to endure for eight hundred years\\". Siege Wexford had got news of the approaching army and prepared to fight the invaders on open ground outside the town. However, upon realizing the strength of its opposition, the defenders burnt their outbuildings (so that the attackers would have no cover) and withdrew behind the walls. Gerald de Barri claimed that the defenders numbered about 2,000. The first attack on Wexford was repulsed at the loss of 18 Normans and 3 defenders. These are believed to have been the only deaths during the siege. Fitz-Stephen then ordered his men to burn all the ships in the town's harbour. The next morning, the attack on Wexford began again. Shortly after, the defenders sent envoys to Diarmait. The defenders agreed to surrender and renew their allegiance to Diarmait. It is claimed that they were persuaded to surrender by two bishops who were in the town at the time. Aftermath The baronies of Forth and Bargy - this land was granted to Norman commander Robert Fitz-Stephen after the siege The besieging army and its commanders garrisoned at Ferns (Fearna), Diarmait's headquarters. Fitz-Stephen was granted ownership of Wexford and a large area of land corresponding to the modern baronies of Forth and Bargy. This would become the first Norman colony in Ireland. After about three weeks of inactivity, Diarmait and Fitz-Stephen's forces attacked the territory of Osraighe (anglicized Ossory) on Leinster's western border. They then launched raids to the north, in the territories of the Uí Tuathail, the Uí Broin and the Uí Conchobhair. High King Ruaidhrí Ua Conchobhair marched his forces into Leinster and, with the mediation of the Church, the commanders of the two armies began negotiations at Ferns. An agreement was reached, whereby Diarmait was allowed to remain King of Leinster if he recognized Ruaidhrí as High King and if he agreed to send his Norman allies back to Britain. Although relative peace followed, Diarmait allowed the Normans to remain in Leinster. In May 1170, a second wave of Normans arrived and restarted the invasion.

The planet was confirmed using Doppler spectroscopy, or the observation and extrapolation of data from a recorded Doppler effect in the star's light, but later observations found no transiting pattern. The planet was published by its discoverers on February 8, 2011. Naming and discovery GJ 3634 is named for its location in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked through the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits. Radial velocity measurements revealed the existence of a planet with a mass of at least 7 Earths. This planet, GJ 3634 b, became the first planet to be discovered under the new strategy. The team of astronomers then followed up with transit measurements using instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope; they found that there was most likely no transit event present at the star, but they were able to discover its true mass. GJ 3634 b was published to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011. Characteristics GJ 3634 is an M-type red dwarf, a cool, small and dim star that shines with reddish light. It lies in the Hydra constellation. The star is 45% the mass of the Sun, and is 43% the Sun's size. GJ 3634, described by its discoverers as an \\"intermediately active star,\\" has a luminosity of 0.02, meaning that it releases about 2% of the energy that the Sun radiates. The star is relatively metal-poor; with a metallicity of [Fe/H] -0.10, GJ 3634 has 79% the amount of iron that has been measured in the Sun. The star is younger than the Sun, with an estimated age of at most three billion years. GJ 3634 has an apparent magnitude of 11.95. Thus, despite its proximity at 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years) away from the Earth, it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. The star is of a similar distance from Earth as planet-bearing 51 Pegasi, which lies at a distance of 14.7 parsecs (47.95 light years). Planetary system GJ 3634 has one confirmed planet in orbit: GJ 3634 b. The planet was called a Super- Earth by its discoverers because of its mass, which was deduced to be 8.4 times that of Earth's and 0.02 times that of Jupiter's. GJ 3634 b has an extremely short orbital period, orbiting GJ 3634 every 2.64561 days. The planet orbits near to its star, and is at an average distance of .0287 AU away. It has an orbital eccentricity of 0.08, meaning that its orbit is very circular. The initial study into the system suggests that a second planet in the inner system is unlikely. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b, however, noted the signal of a secondary body of an unknown nature that most likely orbits GJ 3634 every 200 days with a mass that is at most double that of Neptune.

A total of four episodes were broadcast, including a single feature-length self-titled pilot in 1993,BFI.org and a series of three episodes, filmed in 1995, and broadcast between 1995 and 1996. Although broadcast as the final episode of the series, Sleeping Dogs is set chronologically after the events of the self- titled pilot (which was re-titled The Wolves are Howling for disambiguation reasons on repeat broadcasts and home video release). Aside from Neil, the only other character to appear in all four films was the Controller. In the pilot, this role was assumed by Derek Jacobi (under the pseudonym of Randal). For the series, Jacobi was replaced by Susan Jameson. The only other recurring character throughout the series was Andy, a wheelchair-bound researcher and collator, played by Dave Hill.

The film addresses a personal crisis Kim went through, sparked by an incident during the filming of his previous film, Dream, where the lead actress nearly died by hanging, and by the departure of a couple of close colleagues, including the director Jang Hoon. The title comes from a Korean folk song with the same title. In a heavily line-broken text released about the film, Kim writes that \\"Through Arirang I understand human beings, thank the nature, and accept my life as it is now.\\" Kim produced the film entirely on his own. It premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Prix un certain regard. Release The film premiered on 13 May at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival where it was screened in Un Certain Regard. Kim only did one interview at the festival, where he said that he felt better than when he made the film, and that it had helped him cure himself. At one occasion during the interview, Kim suddenly started to sob and sang \\"Arirang\\". Reception After attending the festival screening in Cannes, Variety's Leslie Felperin wrote: \\"Further evidence, as if it were needed, that digital is both the liberation of low-budget filmmaking and the enabler of self- indulgence\\". Felperin went on to call Arirang \\"An experience that can be likened only to being stuck next to a drunk in a bar who keeps reminding you he used to be famous, all his friends are bastards and he now understands the meaning of life\\". In Screen Daily, Dan Fainaru called it \\"the ultimate 'film d'auteur'\\", and wrote: \\"Doing it justice in a short review is almost impossible, not because Kim Ki-duk is providing revolutionary insights into his line of work, but because he raises numerous issues that are too often ignored as irrelevant or pedantic by professionals who should know better.\\" Peter Bradshaw wrote: \\"It is the most extravagantly self-indulgent piece of pure loopiness imaginable – but gripping as well. A piece of experimentalism at odds with convention.\\" The film won the Prize of Un Certain Regard, the top award for best film in the section. The win was shared with the German film Stopped on Track, directed by Andreas Dresen. ReferencesPublications MARTONOVA, (2012) A.

The group was named at the time The Bangs, and its line-up consisted of Susanna Hoffs, Debbi Peterson and Vicki Peterson. The group was part of the Paisley Underground movement, a musical scene based around Los Angeles in which groups mixed 1960s-inspired pop with garage rock. \\"Getting Out of Hand\\", written by Vicki Peterson and sung by Hoffs, was released as The Bangs' debut single on their own label DownKiddie Records, and distributed locally around Los Angeles in 1981. In order to gain more exposure, Hoffs personally handed a copy of the single to radio DJ Rodney Bingenheimer, pleading for the song to be aired on his radio show Rodney on the ROQ. In December 1981, Bingenheimer started playing the single, resulting in an increase of the audience on the band's live shows. The Bangles would later contribute an instrumental song, \\"Bitchen Summer\\", to the Rodney On The Roq: Volume 3 compilation issued in 1982. In early 1982, The Bangs had to rename themselves Bangles after a New Jersey band of the same name threatened to sue the band. Accordingly, the single was reissued (again on the DownKiddie label) with the name change, with the subtitle \\"formerly The Bang's\\" on the cover. A group photograph on the back of this reissued single showed Bangles' bass player Annette Zilinskas, who had joined the band at the time, although she didn't play on the record. The b-side, \\"Call On Me\\", was co-written by Hoffs, Vicki Peterson, and David Roback, a friend of Hoffs' brother and lead singer of fellow Paisley Underground band Rain Parade. In 1982, while the group was still known as The Bangs, \\"Getting out of Hand\\" was rewritten with new lyrics but with the same musical structure, for a short radio commercial for an underground L.A. magazine named NO MAG, announcing a new issue of the magazine. The repurposed song (named \\"NO MAG Commercial\\") was later released on the 1983 compilation The Radio Tokyo Tapes. \\"Getting Out of Hand\\" was not a success and did not hit the charts, but it did gain the attention of music executive Miles Copeland, who signed the band to his label Faulty Products. The Bangles then released the EP Bangles in 1982, although neither \\"Getting out of Hand\\" nor \\"Call On Me\\" was included on the record. \\"Getting Out of Hand\\" and \\"Call On Me\\" were never included on any Bangles album (until they were collected on the 2014 compilation of early material, Ladies and Gentlemen...The Bangles!), and with the band shifting their sound as the '80's progressed, the record fell into relative obscurity. In 2003 however, The Bangles resurrected both songs and released them for the first time on CD in remastered form as b-sides to their new singles, the former as a b-side to their \\"Something That You Said\\" single and the latter on the \\"Tear Off Your Own Head (It's A Doll Revolution)\\" single.

He appeared for Somerset in thirteen matches between 2011 and 2015, but was constantly beset by injury, hampering his progress. He was released by Somerset at the end of the 2015 season, and indicated that he would retire from professional cricket. Cricket career Adam Dibble was born in Exeter, Devon on 9 March 1991. As a right-arm fast-medium bowler, he played age-group cricket for Devon County Cricket Club before joining Somerset in 2008. During 2009 and 2010, he played for Somerset's second team, alongside club cricket for Sidmouth Cricket Club. His strong performances for the second team led to his senior debut in 2011, during the Clydesdale Bank 40, a one-day competition. He played four matches during that competition, taking five wickets at a bowling average of 34. Later that season he made his first-class debut, appearing in two County Championship matches, during which he took two wickets. He travelled with the Somerset team to compete in the 2011 Champions League Twenty20, where he played against the Warriors in the group stage and the Mumbai Indians in the semi-final. Those were his only senior Twenty20 appearances for Somerset, and he claimed two wickets at an average of 22. Dibble made an early season appearance in the County Championship in which he took three wickets against Warwickshire, but suffered a rib injury during the game which ruled him out of the team. A recurring knee injury, tripartite patella, required an operation to repair, which resulted in him missing the rest of the 2012 season. He returned to the team in 2013, playing three one- day matches in which he took six wickets, including his career best bowling of 4 for 52 against Yorkshire. His season was once again curtailed by injury, on this occasion to his hamstring. During 2014 and 2015 he predominantly played for Somerset's second team, although he did appear in the first-class fixture against Durham MCCU at the start of the 2015 season, making his final first- team appearance for Somerset. He was released by Somerset at the end of 2015, and retired from professional cricket to work in the property market.

History El Encanto was the largest department store in Cuba, with five retail storeys, originally built in 1888, and situated on the corner of Galiano and San Rafael in Old Havana. Before the Cuban Revolution, it had been privately owned, but in 1959 it was nationalized. In 1961, it had about 930 employees. On 9 April 1961, a bomb exploded outside the store, near the main entrance, resulting in broken windows of several stores in the same street.Rodriguez (1999), pp. 122-125 Incident At 6:00 pm on 13 April 1961, the store closed as usual. At about 7:00 pm, two incendiary devices exploded in the tailoring department. The next day, the charred body of Fe del Valle was found in the rubble, other casualties being recorded as 18 people injured. Fe del Valle had been a supervisor in the children's department, and had evidently been attempting to recover money donated to the Federation of Cuban Women for the construction of a day care center for children of store employees; she had become trapped, and was overcome by dense smoke. Police investigation At about midnight on 13 April 1961, in the district of Baracoa Beach, west of Havana, militiamen observed lights being flashed from land towards the sea. Nearby houses were searched, and Carlos González Vidal was recognized by an officer as an employee of the store, in its record department. He was arrested and transferred to State Security, where colonel Oscar Gámez identified him as a principal suspect. Carlos González confessed to the action of setting the two incendiary bombs, and provided details of the devices, events and people involved in assisting him. He recounted that Jorge Camellas (aka \\"Cawy\\"), a CIA agent, had been infiltrated into Cuba with a consignment of C-4 plastic explosives from Miami. Mario Pombo Matamoros, chief of the Movimiento Revolutionario del Pueblo (MRP, or People's Revolutionary Movement), outlined the arson plan to Carlos, who had been recruited by his uncle Reynold González, CIA agent and a leader of the MRP. At about 2:00 pm on 13 April 1961, via Dalia Jorge, Arturo Martinez Pagalday supplied Carlos with two sets of C-4 explosive in packs of Eden cigarettes. After the store closed at 6:00 pm, Carlos planted the devices within bolts of cloth in the tailoring department, then departed with the intention of escaping by boat that night. Carlos González Vidal was later tried, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad.Molina, Gabriel.

Its common names include sunder, sundri, jekanazo and pinlekanazo. It is the dominant mangrove tree species of the Sundarbans of Bangladesh and India, and comprises about 70% of the trees in the area. H. fomes is a major timber- producing tree. It is threatened by over-harvesting, water diversions in the Ganges Basin, fluctuations in salinity due to upstream and coastal development and top dying disease. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being \\"endangered\\". Description Heritiera fomes is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to a height of . The roots are shallow and spreading and send up pneumatophores. The trunk develops buttresses and is grey with vertically fissured bark. Trees with girths of used to be found but these large trees have mostly been harvested for their timber. The trunk has few large branches and the canopy is open. The leathery leaves are elliptical and tend to be clustered at the ends of the twigs. The pink or orange bell- shaped flowers are each about across. They form in panicles, each flower being either male or female. The fruit carpels are up to long and wide. They ripen between June and August and the seeds germinate readily. Distribution and habitat Heritiera fomes is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, its range extending from the east coast of India through Bangladesh and Malaysia to Myanmar and Thailand. Compared to other species of mangrove, it grows in less saline environments and on drier ground that gets inundated by the tide only infrequently. It thrives on clayey soils and is the dominant species in these habitats, typically growing on the low banks that form around the edges of saucer-shaped, newly emerged islands. It is the dominant mangrove species in the area and its local name, sundri, gives the Sundarbans region its name. Uses Timber produced from Heritiera fomes is hard, fine-grained, tough and elastic. The heartwood is dark red or reddish brown and the sapwood is a paler reddish brown. The timber has many uses; in bridge building, house construction, boat building and joinery, as utility poles and tool handles, making hardboard and as firewood. The tree is grown commercially in plantations. The bark of H. fomes is rich in procyanidins. The ethanol extract has been shown to have antioxidant properties. It also shows antimicrobial activities against Kocuria rhizophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is non-toxic in brine shrimp toxicity tests. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this mangrove as being \\"endangered\\". Although it is common in places, it has a restricted range and is declining because of the clearing of mangroves for coastal development, rice farming, shrimp ponds and oil palm plantations. It is present in several protected areas in the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, but there and elsewhere it is being affected by top dying disease.

The parish had a population of 185 in the 2001 UK Census, reducing to 169 at the 2011 census, and is grouped with Grendon Bishop and Wacton to form Bredenbury & District Group Parish Council for administrative purposes. The parish church, dedicated to St Andrew, is in the syle of 1300 but was built in the 1870s from a design by T H Wyatt. Land for the church was donated by William Barneby, of nearby Bredenbury Court. The Barneby family commissioned many of the interior furnishings for the new church. Wyatt also designed the first phase of Bredenbury Court in the Italianate style. An extension in 1902 was designed by Sir Guy Dawber. Bredenbury Primary School is much smaller than average but was rated as outstanding by Ofsted in 2008.

The forewings are turquoise green in the females, blue or dark bluish in males (sexual dimorphism). The abdomen is bluish-black. The larvae are yellowish and have two brownish stripes running from head to the end of the abdomen. Biology Adult leafhoppers can mostly be encountered from July through October. These leafhoppers are polyphagous, feeding on the sap of various species of herbaceous plants, mainly Juncus effusus (Juncaceae sp.), Carex Herbert Nickel & Reinhard Remane Check list of the planthoppers and leafhoppers of Germany, with notes on food plants, diet width, life cycles, geographic range and conservation status (Hemiptera, Fulgoromorpha and Cicadomorpha and Scirpus sylvaticus (Cyperaceae sp.), Holcus mollis (Poaceae sp.), Galium palustre (Rubiaceae) and Fabaceae species. Cicadella viridis may have one or more generations per year. In the colder parts of Europe, there is one generation per year, in the warmer parts two, and in some regions even three generations. In the temperate climate of Europe, females lay eggs in late August - early November. This species overwinters in the egg stage. Nymphs appear in the spring. The transformation of nymphs into adults occurs in June or in July. The 'Green Leafhoppers' are mainly preyed by spiders (Parasteatoda tepidariorum, Dolomedes fimbriatus, Tetragnatha extensa). Possible parasites are several Dryinidae species. Moreover several parasitoids of the family Mymaridae (Anagrus species) lay their eggs in eggs of these leafhoppers.Mark A. Jervis.

He was born in Mainz in 1922, where his grandfather's family wine business, H. Sichel Söhne had been established. He was educated in Germany and then in 1935 was sent to be educated in England. He was at St Cyprian's SchoolPeter M.F. Sichel, The Secrets of My Life, 2016 and Stowe School. While he was at school in England, his parents escaped from Nazi Germany on a ruse, and the family settled in France. The firm had offices in London and Bordeaux, and at the start of World War II, while he was apprenticed to the Bordeaux firm, he was interned as he was German. He escaped to the USA via Spain and worked as a US Office of Strategic Services, running agents in Germany for which he was given the Distinguished Intelligence Medal. Shortly after the War, he was sent to Berlin to head the secret Strategic Services Unit. He reported in early 1946 on the methods the Soviets were using to control the political parties in the Russian sector of Germany (which became East Germany). Sichel continued to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in Berlin, Washington and Hong Kong until 1960, when he left, saying \\"I left because the CIA did things I didn’t like, such as send people into the Ukraine to work in fabricated resistance groups. They were potentially being sent to their deaths.

Samuel Johnson approved of him as a Jacobite, and gave him a place on the team of six helpers he used on his Dictionary. Shiels died of consumption in May's Buildings, London, on 27 December 1753. Works Shiels was recommended to Ralph Griffiths and employed on the Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland to the time of Dean Swift (London, 5 vols. 1753), to which the name of Theophilus Cibber was attached. The compilation was mainly based on work of Gerard Langbaine and Giles Jacob, with the help of Thomas Coxeter's. Any fresh research used was due to Shiels, with Cibber's role being revision. The later volumes are ascribed on the title-page to Cibber ‘and other hands.’ Apart from his compilations, Shiels wrote a didactic poem on ‘Marriage’ in blank verse (London, ‘at the Dunciad in Ludgate Street,’ 1748), and another piece in praise of Johnson's ‘Irene,’ called ‘The Power of Beauty’ (printed in George Pearch's ‘Collection,’ i. 186).

Along with the cameramen, the Swiss Rainer Klausmann and Pole Piotr Lenar, the Munich composer of film music, Prof. Dr. Norbert J. Schneider (now known as Enjott Schneider) also regularly work closely with Odermatt.  Criticism  Odermatt worked on two of the craziest episodes of the TV shows Tatort and Polizeiruf 110, that really took off with their \\"successful mix of seriousness and intelligent humour that makes a pleasant change from the monotony of crime series\\" (Stern 25/1996) with a \\"curious collection of crazy characters (...), providing the realistic main characters with a grotesque wallpaper as a background\\" (FAZ, 17 June 1996). \\"Having so much wicked humour was a rarity in the crime genre\\" (Der Spiegel 24/1996). In 1989, Gekauftes Glück was regarded by the press and cinemagoers as one Switzerland’s most successful films d'auteur. Critics praised the \\"careful choreography of the images make a pleasant change from the usual loquaciousness of the films d’auteur in the German language\\" (Frankfurter Rundschau, 11 March 1989). Wachtmeister Zumbühl was unsettling in its claustrophobic depiction of the closed society of a small village, where everybody knows everybody else and all of their business, \\"the world in a water droplet\\" (Krzysztof Kieślowski).  Awards  The TV film Zerrissene Herzen (1996; camera: Piotr Lenar) was nominated in the competitions at the Baden-Badener Tage des Fernsehspiels TV awards. Gekauftes Glück was awarded the R d'argento at the 1989 RiminiCinema Film Festival in Rimini. Die Filmbewertungsstelle Wiesbaden (Wiesbaden Film Assessment Board) commended Gekauftes Glück as \\"recommended\\" and Mein Kampf as \\"highly recommended\\".

Directing style  \\"...as (...) an example of the broad spectrum of directing styles in plays staged at the Saarländischen Staatstheater, by far the most unsettling are those that defy expectations of spoken drama and are reputed to be those present in the work of film and theatre director Urs Odermatt. His premieres of Rolf Kemnitzer’s Die Bauchgeburt and Alfred Gulden’s grotesque Dieses. Kleine. Land. confronted audiences with a barrage of signs and symbols conveyed through language and physical gestures. A plethora of information and impulses through the use of an edited film and video-clip aesthetic drew attention to our truncated, edited perception of reality and the nature of our connections of meanings and contextualisation as a construct of our perspective. The viewer is required to forego entirely his contemplative attitude towards that which is presented, and be consciously selective in his perception. The border with that which is experienced in a non-semantic way is crossed in this form of presentation: where energetic manifestations take the place of \\"meaning\\", where the chasm of the loss of communication and the perversion of issues of meaning are intended evoke questions about power for the audience. Odermatt's theatre of rhythmic, alienated, choral voices and expressive physicality attempts to confront that which we never see on the surface of the theatre as portrayed in the media.\\" From: Michael Birkner: Nur keine Komplexe – 15 Jahre Theater für das Saarland. Texte, Bilder, Daten zur Intendanz von Kurt-Josef Schildknecht. Gollenstein Verlag, Blieskastel, .  Stage design  For most of the theatre productions staged by Odermatt – especially the premieres – the Berlin stage designer Dirk Seesemann built the sets. He supports Odermatt's staging concepts \\"with his minimalist austerity\\" (Saarbrücker Zeitung, 21 November 2005).  Criticism  Dieses. Kleine. Land. = \\"[Dieses. Kleine. Land.] ...is concerned with the (preservation) and against (integration) of small countries, the delusion of one-sided notions and the persecution of personal interests. As his means of portraying this, (...) he [Odermatt] employs the grotesque and occasionally drifts off into the absurd. The play represents a huge challenge for the actors as well as for the audience.\\" (Benno von Skopnik, Welt kompakt, 22 November 2005). \\"It is not only the play [Dieses. Kleine. Land.] that is deconstructed and reassembled, but also its characters and their language. Sentences collapse time and time again like a house of cards, and new façades are created from the rubble.. With Odermatt, everything turns into a quote within a quote, which explains why choruses of Schlager songs are sung, phrases are scratched like vinyl records and scenes (like those created specially by Gulden) function as a play-within-a-play.. As a result, speech develops that is by turns choral and concerted, where the voices in the dialogue cross each other and cut each other off. A deconstructivist procedure that mixes pantomime with slapstick and absurdist theatre with concrete poetry. For a long time, this tried and tested deconstructivist ritual captivated audiences just as it had done three years ago at the Saarbrücken premiere of Rolf Kemnitzer’s Die Bauchgeburt, and reveals the dialogue-like qualities of Gulden's play.\\" (Christoph Schreiner, Saarbrücker Zeitung, 21 November 2005). = Der böse Onkel = \\"Odermatt has looked around, and as an author has created a hybrid of Kroetzen’s village tragedies with Ravenhill’s beat-up Brit furore, then throws in Castorf’s- savagery and splatter movie – an overloaded but polemical attempt. As an experienced director he has condensed his theatrical debut into a pacy example of the grotesque. Rather than descending into banal denunciation, in a host of excellently choreographed scenes, he conjures up deeply affecting dreamlike and nightmarish images onto the stage. As a result,in the plays best moments, all the controversial issues suddenly appear to be linked. The stage setting then proceeds to turn into a bizarre analysis of time, becoming a dark, glittering essay on sexuality and power.\\" (Otto Paul Burkhardt: Liebst du mich? Ja, ich dich auch – Urs Odermatt inszeniert seinen Theatererstling als Furioso über Sexualität und Macht, Reutlinger Nachrichten, 29. April 2002). = Trainspotting = \\"An absurd ballet rushes across the stage, cascades of words are layered over each other and fuse together with each other, often barely comprehensible, then into a forceful, insistent crescendo of staccatto: I am, I was, everything goes by so quickly!' Cascades of words with a directness that can barely be beaten, right through to faecal language and further into a highly artificial idiom, pushed too far by precisely placed stuttering or the echo-like repetition of individual words or parts of sentences.(...) Urs Odermatt’s staging is merciless in its immediacy, even more , even more open in its pacy choreography, which demands a huge presence from the ensemble cast dressed in rustling paper with printed pages from tabloid newspapers. Merciless in its physical proximity, which doesn’t required any nudity or exposure because the inner exposure is brought out into the open.\\" (sda, 28 April 2005). = Closer = \\"Men drop their trousers, women break through a huge vagina on a backdrop screen and out onto the stage. Deflowered from behind, the parted labia are flaunted right in the faces of the audience in Oldenburg. The premiere of Partick Marber’s Closer under the direction of Urs Odermatt lives up to its title and after the interval separated the theatregoers into those of a more delicate sensibility from those with a more open mind. The latter were clearly in the majority and greeted the end of the performance with huge applause.\\" (Marijke Gerwin: Wie das Lotterleben so spielt – Sie fickten und sie schlugen sich, taz, 5.

Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Made of wool bouclé, the double-breasted, raspberry pink and navy trim collared suit was matched with a trademark matching pink pillbox hat and white gloves. After President Kennedy was assassinated, Jacqueline Kennedy insisted on wearing the suit, stained with his blood, during the swearing-in of Lyndon B. Johnson on Air Force One and for the flight back to Washington, D.C., with the president's body. Jacqueline Kennedy was a fashion icon, and this outfit is arguably the most referenced and revisited of all of her items of clothing and her trademark. A long-time question among fashion historians and experts about whether the suit was made by Chanel in France or a quality copy purchased from New York's semiannual Chez Ninon collections, was resolved by Coco Chanel's biographer, Justine Picardie. She showed that the suit was a garment made by Chez Ninon using Chanel's approved \\"line for line\\" system with authorized Chanel patterns and materials. The suit as fashion In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Chanel suit was one of the strongest symbols of bourgeois female chic that could be found anywhere in the Western world, evoking a powerful image of a sophisticated, intelligent and independent modern woman. During this era it became the \\"wardrobe staple of the upwardly mobile American female which could fit almost every daytime occasion that required a woman to dress stylishly\\". Although women wearing pink in the 21st century is common, pink was new to fashion in the 1950s and was a color loved and even popularized to an extent in American fashion by Mamie Eisenhower, who endorsed a color which, according to cultural historian Karal Ann Marling, was called \\"Mamie Pink\\". Given that the Chanel suit was a strong statement of an independent woman, the color pink has an element of traditional femininity, perhaps evading the foreign and feminist attributes associated with the Chanel suit in a conservative American society. Before John F. Kennedy departed for Texas he asked his wife what she planned to wear. In an interview with William Manchester after the tragedy, Kennedy said that her husband had told her: It was said that the pink suit was one of her husband's \\"particular favorites\\"; the suit had first been shown by Coco Chanel in her 1961 autumn/winter collection. Photographs exist of Mrs. Kennedy wearing the suit – or one very similar to it – in Washington D.C. in November 1961; to church on November 12, 1961; in London on March 26, 1962; in Washington D.C. in September 1962; in Lafayette Square on September 26, 1962; at the visit by the Prime Minister of Algeria on October 15, 1962; and the visit of the Maharaja of Jaipur on October 23, 1962. After the last of these occasions, she was apparently not photographed wearing it until the day of the assassination, when she was pictured in it at Fort Worth and Dallas leading up to the assassination, having been revealed wearing it after stepping out of Air Force One at Love Field. The suit was double-breasted, with six gold buttons and four square pockets, two on each side. The fabric was a light weight wool from Linton Tweeds in a nubby weave known as bouclé. The color was raspberry although most press reports described it as strawberry pink. The wide quilted collar, jacket lining, piping trim on the sleeves, and at the top of each pocket was navy blue silk. There were two gold buttons on each sleeve. The buttons on the suit had navy blue piping around the edge. A clever feature of Chanel jackets was a small gold chain sewn along the inside bottom edge of jacket to provide just enough weight for it to hang straight. The suit came with a sleeveless navy silk shell blouse. For cool weather, Kennedy would wear a matching navy silk scarf knotted at the neck and tucked into the front of the jacket, which she did in Dallas. Accompanying the suit was a trademark pillbox hat in matching pink with a band of navy piping around the crown. She secured the hat to her head with a standard hatpin. Kennedy carried a navy handbag with a gold buckle and gold chain handle. She wore low-heeled navy shoes with a small gold ornament at the toe. A gold bangle bracelet on her left wrist and short white kid leather gloves with tiny wrist buttons completed her outfit. Most of the American public viewing pictures of the presidential couple on television and in newspapers between 1961 and 1963 would not have known the color of the suit, given that at the time of the assassination TV news was still in black and white and newspapers did not print color photographs. The color of the suit became widely known only after the publication of color photos in Life magazine's JFK memorial issue November 29, 1963 and in Life's Warren Commission report issue October 2, 1964. thumbChanel Haute Couture jacket, F/W 1961. Jacqueline Kennedy's pink Chanel suit was a line-to-line copy made by Chez Ninon in New York based on the original design. This is an original haute couture jacket in the same raspberry pink but with black silk trim made by Coco Chanel in Paris. Adnan Ege Kutay Collection. Authenticity There was long a question among fashion historians and experts whether the suit was made by Chanel in France or a garment purchased from New York's Chez Ninon, a popular dress shop that imported European label designs and materials and put them together in the United States. A number of sources claimed it was more than likely a version of a Chanel pink bouclé wool suit trimmed with a navy blue collar, some asserting it was made by Chez Ninon in 1961. Further complicating the matter was the indisputable fact that the First Lady's \\"official\\" designer was Oleg Cassini, who provided much of her public as well as private wardrobe.Oleg Cassini, In My Own Fashion (1987), pp. 297-299. In her 2010 authorized biography of Coco Chanel, Justine Picardie resolved the matter, stating the fabric, buttons and trim for the jacket came from Chanel in Paris, from which the suit was made and fitted for Kennedy at Chez Ninon, using Chanel's approved \\"line for line\\" system. Picardie insists this system had nothing to do with forgery or trademark infringement, since Chanel supplied the materials to Chez Ninon. The purpose of buying the suit from Chez Ninon was not to save money – the costs were the same – but to appear patriotic to the American electorate by buying her garments from the United States rather than France. The suit in 1963 was estimated to cost $800 to $1,000 ($6,646 to $8,307 in 2019 dollars). Assassination Jacqueline Kennedy wearing her blood-stained pink suit while Johnson takes the oath of office as president Kennedy was seated to the left side of the President in the back seat of the open-top presidential limousine as the vehicle traveled through local streets in Dallas. Immediately after he was shot in the head, her suit was spattered by his blood. Upon arriving at Parkland Hospital, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's wife Lady Bird saw the car and said: At the hospital, Kennedy continued to wear the blood-stained suit, but she had removed her hat. William Manchester wrote in Death of a President: The whereabouts of the hat today are unknown, and the last person known to have had it – her personal secretary, Mary Gallagher – will not discuss it.Fiore, Faye, \\"Jackie Kennedy's pink pillbox hat a missing piece of history\\", Austin American-Statesman, January 30, 2011. Accessed May 6, 2011 Several people asked Kennedy whether she would like to change her suit but she refused. When Lady Bird offered to send someone to help her, she responded: Despite the advice of John F. Kennedy's physician, Admiral George Burkley, who \\"gently tried to persuade her to change out of her gore-soaked pink Chanel suit\\", she wore the suit alongside Vice President Johnson as he was sworn in on Air Force One as the 36th President of the United States. In the photograph of the ceremony (right) the blood stains cannot be seen as they were on the right- hand side of the suit. Lady Bird recalls that during the swearing-in: Kennedy had no regrets about refusing to take the blood-stained suit off; her only regret was that she had washed the blood off her face before Johnson was sworn in. Aftermath When Jacqueline Kennedy finally removed her suit the following morning, her maid folded it and placed it in a box. Some days after the assassination this box was dispatched to Kennedy's mother, Janet Lee Auchincloss, who wrote \\"November 22nd 1963\\" on the top of the box and stored it in her attic. Eventually the box was given to the National Archives in Maryland, together with an unsigned note bearing the Auchincloss letterhead stationery. The note read: \\"Jackie's suit and bag worn Nov. 22, 1963\\". The suit, which was never cleaned, is kept out of public view in \\"an acid-free container in a windowless room ... the precise location is kept secret. The temperature hovers between ; the humidity is 40 percent; the air is changed six times an hour.\\" Kennedy continued to buy Chanel clothes for a time after the assassination. Historical significance Kennedy's Chanel suit has been variously described as \\"a famous pink suit which will forever be embedded in America's historical conscience\\", \\"one of those indelible images Americans had stored: Jackie in the blood-stained pink Chanel suit\\", \\"the most legendary garment in American history\\", and \\"emblematic of the ending of innocence\\". The garment is now stored out of public view in the National Archives. It will not be seen by the public until at least 2103, according to a deed of Caroline Kennedy, Kennedy's sole surviving heir. At that time, when the 100-year deed expires, the Kennedy family descendants will renegotiate the matter. Cultural references The suit has been well referenced and replicated in theater and film. In 2011, a copy of the suit appeared in the mini-series The Kennedys. However, the Chanel copy was recreated by Giorgio Armani. Costume designer Madeline Fontaine recreated the suit for the 2016 film Jackie, with Natalie Portman portraying Kennedy; the buttons, chain, and label were provided by Chanel. Costume designer Jane Petrie recreated the suit for the second season of The Crowns eighth episode, \\"Dear Mrs. Kennedy\\".https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6410770/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt In the Simpsons episode 'Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield', the Chanel outfit worn by Marge Simpson (whose maiden name is Bouvier in a nod to the former First Lady) was modelled upon Kennedy's suit.

Life Eldest son of Giles Jones, secretary to the York Buildings Water Company, and nephew of Griffith Jones (1722–1786), he was born in London in 1763, and admitted to St Paul's School, London on 24 April 1775. He was first placed under a sculptor, but afterwards apprenticed to a printer in Fetter Lane. On the expiration of his indentures he became a corrector for the press. He was employed by William Strahan for four years, and afterwards by Thomas Wright in Peterborough Court. On Wright's death, in March 1797, he undertook the editorship of the Whitehall Evening Post; with the decline of that journal he was appointed to the management, and became part proprietor, of the General Evening Post; which also declined in circulation, and was ultimately merged in the St. James's Chronicle. From 1797 to 1814 he compiled from the newspapers and other periodicals an amusing annual volume entitled ‘The Spirit of the Public Journals,’ of which a new series, with illustrations by George Cruikshank, appeared in 1823–5. On the death of Isaac Reed, in 1807, he became editor of the European Magazine; a committed freemason, for some years he ran the Freemasons' Magazine. In the end he had little literary employment. He died in Upper King Street, now Southampton Row, Holborn, on 20 Dec. 1827. He married his first cousin, Christian, daughter of his uncle Griffith Jones.

It serves the easternmost portion of Putnam County and is a part of the Putnam County Schools. The school is rated as having 601 students for athletic purposes, placing it in class AA. The school colors are red and grey. Pocatalico is a Native American word meaning \\"river of fat deer.\\" Its original mascot was an American Indian riding upon a white horse. \\"Legend\\" passed down through the years tells of a Native American, Pocatalico, who was killed at the mouth of the Pocatalico River. The current nickname, thought to be unique in the nation and for which the school is mildly famous, is the \\"Dots\\", and has been featured by ESPN and Sports Illustrated in several lists of best school mascots. \\"The Dot\\" mascot was first referenced in 1928, during a storming football game when a reporter exclaimed, \\"they look like a bunch of red polka dots running around the field!\\" The name stuck and is still currently used. History Poca High School first opened its doors in September, 1922 using a small white schoolhouse located on a hillside between Bancroft and Black Betsy, West Virginia. The school then moved to a much larger building overlooking Poca's Main Street in 1926. In 1970, the school relocated to its current building on the outskirts of town. Over the next decade, Poca High School's then-modern 1970 design was replicated to build new buildings for Hurricane and Winfield High Schools, also located in Putnam County. Thus, while subsequent renovations and additions over the years have introduced unique character, the core sections of three of Putnam County's four high schools share nearly-identical floor plans. Poca High School itself received significant renovation and addition in 2011-2012. Following the high school's move to its current building, the former 1926-era building was used as Poca Junior High (later Middle) School from 1970 until 2012; that building was demolished in 2013 after construction of a new building for the middle school.http://www.wowktv.com/story/22974350/old-poca-middle-school-to-be- demolished The first graduating class consisted of eleven students. The first school paper, The School Echo, was published in January, 1924. Three years later, the first annual yearbook, The Pocatalico, was published. Since then, there has been an issue of The Pocatalico released every year. Arts and athletics Poca High School is known for fielding highly competitive athletic teams and music ensembles (including marching band and show choir) which have earned the school multiple awards, championships, and recognition on the state, regional, and national stages.

Tight oil (also known as shale oil, shale- hosted oil or light tight oil, abbreviated LTO) is light crude oil contained in petroleum-bearing formations of low permeability, often shale or tight sandstone. Economic production from tight oil formations requires the same hydraulic fracturing and often uses the same horizontal well technology used in the production of shale gas. While sometimes called \\"shale oil\\", tight oil should not be confused with oil shale, which is shale rich in kerogen, or shale oil, which is oil produced from oil shales. Therefore, the International Energy Agency recommends using the term \\"light tight oil\\" for oil produced from shales or other very low permeability formations, while the World Energy Resources 2013 report by the World Energy Council uses the terms \\"tight oil\\" and \\"shale-hosted oil\\". Shown are conceptual illustrations of types of oil and gas wells. A vertical well is producing from a conventional oil and gas deposit (right). Also shown are wells producing from unconventional formations: a vertical coalbed methane well (second from right); a horizontal well producing from a shale formation (center); and a well producing from a tight sand formation (left). In May 2013 the International Energy Agency in its Medium-Term Oil Market Report (MTOMR) said that the North American oil production surge led by unconventional oils - US light tight oil (LTO) and Canadian oil sands - had produced a global supply shock that would reshape the way oil is transported, stored, refined and marketed. Inventory and examples Tight oil formations include the Bakken Shale, the Niobrara Formation, Barnett Shale, and the Eagle Ford Shale in the United States, R'Mah Formation in Syria, Sargelu Formation in the northern Persian Gulf region, Athel Formation in Oman, Bazhenov Formation and Achimov Formation of West Siberia in Russia, Arckaringa Basin in Australia, Chicontepec Formation in Mexico, and the Vaca Muerta oil field in Argentina. In June 2013 the U.S. Energy Information Administration published a global inventory of estimated recoverable tight oil and tight gas resources in shale formations, \\"Technically Recoverable Shale Oil and Shale Gas Resources: An Assessment of 137 Shale Formations in 41 Countries Outside the United States.\\" The inventory is incomplete due to exclusion of tight oil and gas from sources other than shale such as sandstone or carbonates, formations underlying the large oil fields located in the Middle East and the Caspian region, off shore formations, or about which there is little information. Amounts include only high quality prospects which are likely to be developed. In 2012, at least 4,000 new producing shale oil (tight oil) wells were brought online in the United States. By comparison, the number of new producing oil and gas wells (both conventional and unconventional) completed in 2012 globally outside the United States and Canada is less than 4,000.\\"The Shale Oil Boom: a US Phenomenon\\" by Leonardo Maugeri, Harvard University, Geopolitics of Energy Project, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Discussion Paper 2013-05 Characteristics Tight oil shale formations are heterogeneous and vary widely over relatively short distances. Tight oil reservoirs subjected to fracking can be divided into four different groups. Type I has little matrix porosity and permeability – leading to fractures dominating both storage capacity and fluid flow pathways. Type II has low matrix porosity and permeability, but here the matrix provides storage capacity while fractures provide fluid-flow paths. Type III are microporous reservoirs with high matrix porosity but low matrix permeability, thus giving induced fractures dominance in fluid-flow paths. Type IV is macroporous reservoirs with high matric porosity and permeability, thus the matrix provides both storage capacity and flow paths while fractures only enhance permeability. Even in a single horizontal drill hole, the amount recovered may vary, as may recovery within a field or even between adjacent wells. This makes evaluation of plays and decisions regarding the profitability of wells on a particular lease difficult. Production of oil from tight formations requires at least 15 to 20 percent natural gas in the reservoir pore space to drive the oil toward the borehole; tight reservoirs which contain only oil cannot be economically produced. Formations which formed under marine conditions contain less clay and are more brittle, and thus more suitable for fracking than formations formed in fresh water which may contain more clay. Formations with more quartz and carbonate are more brittle. The natural gas and other volatiles in LTO make it more hazardous to handle, store, and transport. This was an aggravating factor in the series of fatal explosions after the Lac-Mégantic derailment. Exploitation Prerequisites for exploitation include being able to obtain rights to drill, easier in the United States and Canada where private owners of subsurface rights are motivated to enter into leases; the availability of expertise and financing, easier in the United States and Canada where there are many independent operators and supporting contractors with critical expertise and suitable drilling rigs; infrastructure to gather and transport oil; and water resources for use in hydraulic fracturing. Analysts expect that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American tight oil fields in 2015. The large increase in tight oil production is one of the reasons behind the price drop in late 2014.Ovale, Peder. \\"Her ser du hvorfor oljeprisen faller\\" In English Teknisk Ukeblad, 11 December 2014. Accessed: 11 December 2014. Outside the United States and Canada, development of shale oil (tight oil) resources may be limited by the lack of available drilling rigs: 2/3 of the world's active drill rigs are in the US and Canada, and rigs elsewhere are less likely to be equipped for horizontal drilling. Drilling intensity may be another constraint, as tight-oil development requires far more completed wells than does conventional oil. Leonardo Maugeri considers this will be \\"an insurmountable environmental hurdle in Europe\\". Detailed studies on production behaviour in prolific shale plays were light tight oil is produced have shown that the average monthly initial production of a tight oil well is around 500 barrels/day, which yields an estimated ultimate recovery in the range 150-290 thousand barrels. As a consequence, exploitation of tight oil tends to be drilling intensive with many new wells needed to ramp up and maintain production over time. Size of tight oil resources=US EIA estimated technically recoverable tight oil in shale Following are estimates of technically recoverable volumes of tight oil associated with shale formations, made by the US Energy Information Administration in 2013. Not all oil which is technically recoverable may be economically recoverable at current or anticipated prices. #Kingdom of Bahrain: 80 billion barrels #Russia: 75 billion barrels #United States: 78.2 billion barrels #China: 32 billion barrels #Argentina: 27 billion barrels #Libya: 26 billion barrels #Venezuela: 13 billion barrels #Mexico: 13 billion barrels #Pakistan: 9 billion barrels #Canada: 9 billion barrels #Indonesia: 8 billion barrels World Total 335 to 345 billion barrels Other estimates Australia: A private oil company announced in 2013 that it had discovered tight oil in shale of the Arckaringa Basin, estimated at 3.5 to 223 billion barrels. Production In September 2018, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected October tight oil production in the U.S. at 7.6 million barrels per day. The volume of oil production on tight oil formations in the US depends significantly on the dynamics of the WTI oil price. About six months after the price change, drilling activity changes, and with it the volume of production. These changes and their expectations are so significant that they themselves affect the price of oil and hence the volume of production in the future. These regularities are described in mathematical language by a differential extraction equation with a retarded argument.

Biography After obtaining his degree in biochemistry, Popov served as a division head at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology (known as \\"Vector\\") and at Obolensk, both branches of the Soviet bio-weapons program dedicated to developing genetically enhanced products. His position led him to expand his researches into the fields of molecular biology and microbiology. Popov worked at Vector from 1976 to 1986 and at Obolensk from 1986 until 1992. His work included \\"designer\\" bio-agents that would cause the symptoms of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, in which a victim's auto-immune system attacks its own body. His team inserted genes into viruses to make protein fragments of myelin (the sheathing around nerves). Victims that became infected would develop multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the nervous system. By splicing myelin into Legionella (Legionnaires' disease), they also created an agent that caused brain damage, paralysis and death. The recombinant Legionella was very infectious and lethal with only a few cells causing disease. At Oblensk, Popov and his team spliced the diphtheria toxin gene into the plague bacterium, thus creating a highly virulent and deadly strain. Popov has described Biopreparat's \\"Project Bonfire\\", whose goal was to develop antibiotic-resistant microbial strains, and \\"Project Factor\\", whose goal was to create microbial weapons with new biologic properties that would result in high virulence, improved stability, and new clinical syndromes.Popov, S (2000), \\"Interview: Serguei Popov\\" , J Homeland Security, 13 November 2000; Accessed on 1 May 2011.

Until 2019, the company was a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, before being divested. History The company can trace its roots back to the mid-1950s when Eli Lilly introduced their first antibiotic aimed at veterinary usage with the new plant and animal sciences research being combined into Lilly's Agro-Industrial division. In the 1960s the Agro-Industrial division was reorganised, launching Elanco Products Company. The 1970s marked a decade of expansion for the business, increasing international operations to 38 global affiliates and 17 manufacturing locations. In the 1980s research moved to away from plant sciences and focussed on animal health and food quality. In the 1990s another reorganisation led to the company being renamed Elanco Animal Health, focussing solely on animal health. In 2007 the business acquired Ivy Animal Health and launched its companion animal business. In 2008 Elanco partnered with Heifer International in order to address food security in developing nations. In 2009 the business launched its data analytics business, Elanco Knowledge Solutions. In 2010 the business acquired the European rights to a portfolio of Pfizer Animal Health treatments and an Irish manufacturing site. In 2011, Elanco expanded its footprint in Europe, acquiring Janssen Animal Health and committed to ending hunger for 100,000 families through the Heifer International partnership. In 2012 the business acquired ChemGen Corp., improving their offering in enzyme-based nutrient absorption tools for food- livestock. In 2014, the business acquired Lohmann SE and Lohmann Animal Health for an undisclosed sum and Novartis Animal Health for $5.4 billion, the former boosting Elanco's poultry and vaccine business and the latter increasing a broad spectrum of treatments across companion animal, livestock, vaccine and aquaculture offerings. In 2016 Elanco expanded its US-based business, acquiring a suite of vaccines from Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica for $885 million. In 2018, Lilly announced plans to separate its Elanco Animal Health unit from the rest of the business via an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, with the stock-ticker ELAN. In 2019, the divestiture was completed and Elanco launched on the New York Stock Exchange. In the same year the US FDA approved the first canine lymphoma treatment. The business continued to expand is US-business, acquiring Aratana Therapeutics, and its first-in-class treatment for canine osteoarthritis. Elanco also announced it would acquire the developer of vaccines for bacterial disease prevention in food-animals, Prevtec Microbia, Inc.. In the same year the business announced it would acquire Bayer’s animal health business for $7.6 billion.

One a dare, fraternity pledge Donald Whiting is forced to ask Linda to the Dance which she gleefully accepts. Once home her guardian and older half-sister, Eileen Strong, does not allow her to go even after her cook Katy has gotten excited for her. After Eileen's rejection, Katy, Linda, and her cousin, Marian Strong, conspire to get Linda a dress and shoes for the dance. In the interim, Linda was singing in the woods of the Strong estate one day when a voice joined her in duet of a man who had been fishing on the property, not knowing her was trespassing. They finish their song, and Linda goes to meet him but falls in the water where he pulls her out. Free of her glasses, she and \\"Crusoe\\" have a picnic and talk excitedly about fishing and the like. Linda believes he would be a good match for her cousin Marian whose fiancé, John, has been stolen by Eileen. \\"Crusoe\\" drives her back home where Linda and Marian wave him off. Only then does Linda find out from Marian that \\"Crusoe\\" is the famous singer Philip Niles in town to relax, visit relatives, and attend a dance in his honor. The night of the dance Linda is readying herself with Marian and Katy when she receives a call from Susie who has just learned of the plot to get Donald to ask Linda to the dance. Linda is heartbroken and refuses to go to the dance with him. However, her transformation means Donald actually wants to take her to the dance and doesn't take no for an answer until Linda sprays him and his fraternity brothers with the hose. As she goes off to cry, Philip shows up and offers to take her to the dance. Upon arriving few can believe it is really Linda especially on the arm of the guest of honor. They sing a duet and Linda gets attention from all the boys while Eileen shows up and sets her sights on Philip and Linda's career in singing. Eileen invites him for tea the next day \\"to talk about Linda's future\\" expressly dis-inviting Linda from the conversation. In response Linda spreads word to some nearby old women that Philip will be at her house tomorrow for tea. As Eileen is overrun by 150 women for tea, Philip joins Marian and Linda on a picnic as Linda is still trying to play matchmaker for her cousin. There they run into John after he sends a golf ball straight into their lemon pie. That evening the character gather for dinner at the Strong's where Eileen finally gets Philip alone and discusses Linda's future while she eavesdrops. After this debacle, Marian tells Linda that she is not interested in Philip and would like Linda to pursue him. Having no experience in the field, Linda borrows Eileen's copy of How to Get Your Man which leads her to take Philip to her family's cabin. While there she tampers with the car and hose to make it appear that they are stranded in the rain and must wait to leave and get help. Philip finds the book and decides not to confront her until Eileen pulls up and makes Linda's scheming clear. Eileen then wants to go to San Francisco with Philip to talk more about Linda's future. Fed up, Linda fixes and drives Philip's car back to warn John of his fiancée's plans with Philip. John misunderstands and believes Marian is leaving with Philip and slaps him before everything is made clear. With this outburst John also realizes that he never lost his love for Marian and proposes to her again and they are married that day. After the ceremony Philip asks Eileen for Linda's hand which she absolutely refuses. The last scene sees Philip and Linda agree to marry once she is 18 and no longer needs Marian's consent so she can join him as a famous singer and his wife.

Archaeological data indicated that the period impacted human life. During the first stage of research, sources were examined for extreme hydro-climatic events between 16000 and 18000 BCE in the Caspian drainage basin. Research focused on sources of water for these events, such as megafloods in river valleys and melting permafrost augmenting watersheds. The investigation's second stage included chronological correlation of the events using stratigraphy, geomorphology and radiocarbon dating. This was followed by paleohydrologic reconstruction of the basins, including their level, area, volume and water exchange between basins. Based on archeological data, the influence of the events on prehistoric human life was studied. The investigation aimed to comprehensively describe the period. Time and place During the deglaciation following the Last Glacial Maximum, northwestern Eurasia experienced widespread flooding from the Atlantic Ocean to the Yenisei River, including the subarctic and Himalayas: over . Flooding occurred in four landforms: marine lowlands, river valleys, watersheds and slopes, and peaked 17,000 to 15,000 years ago.

The chocolate clays and related Khvalynean sediments are usually , occasionally exceeding . They are primarily limited to the Caspian Depression, from the modern Caspian coast to the foothills of the surrounding mountains. Stratigraphy In the marine sequence of the Caspian basin, the Khvalynean layers are above the Late Khazarian ones (which date to the last interglacial period) and below the New Caspian (Holocene) deposits. They are separated from the Lower Khazarian series by continental Atelian layers synchronous to marine sediments from the Atelian basin. The level of the latter was below the present Caspian level—in other words, below sea level.Lokhin M.Yu., Maev E.G.

(In Russian) In the Caspian Depression, the Khvalynean sediments occur primarily near the surface; younger still (and higher in the sequence) are the Holocene floodplain lacustrine and marine (New Caspian) sediments. EEI deposits in the Black Sea basin occur in the New Euxinian series. On the continental slope and in the deep-sea basin, they are a light reddish-brown and a pale yellow mud thick.Ryan W.B.F., Pitman W.C.I., Major C.O., Shimkus K., Moskalenko V., et al. 1997. An abrupt drowning of the Black Sea shelf. Mar. Geol. 138: 119–26 In color they resemble the chocolate clays of the Caspian basin, and their age is near that of the latter (15,000 BP). Fossils Indicators of an EEI are brackish-water mollusk species close to modern North Caspian ones. Among these are Caspian endemic species of the Limnocardiidae family, such as the Didacna Eichwald genus.Nevesskaya L.A. (1965) Late Quaternary bivalve mollusks of the Black Sea: their systematics and ecology. Acad. nauk SSSR Paleont. Inst. Trudy 105: 1–390 (In Russian) Although the latter is not presently found outside the Caspian Sea, it occurred widely in the Azov—Black Sea basin during the Pleistocene until the Karangatian era. Gastropods are represented by the Caspian endemic genera Caspia and Micromelania. Shells of the Early Khvalynean complex are distinguished by their small size (two to three times smaller than present ones) and thin walls. The complex is usually considered as a product of cold climate and low salinity. New Black Sea sediments contain mollusks of the Caspian type.Algan O., Cagatay N., Tchepalyga A., Ongan D., Eastoe C., Gokasan E.

The large basin covered about and held up to 700,000 km3 of water and 5000 km3 (10 billion tons) of salt. Discharging more than 60,000 m3 per second, it ran 3,000 km west to east (from the Mediterranean to Central Asia) and 2,500 km (from 57 to 35°N) north to south. Its drainage basin covered more than three million km3. The Eurasian cascade system of seas and lakes is unparalleled in water area. The largest intra-continental lake system of today (the Great Lakes of North America) is six times smaller (245,000 km2), with a water volume 30 times smaller (22,700 km3), a discharge four times smaller (14,000 m3/s) and a drainage basin three times smaller. The peak inundation apparently centered on the Khvalynean basin (the recent Caspian Sea). Its level rose and its area increased six times, to one million square kilometers. Its water volume doubled (to 130,000 km3), with a salinity of 10-12‰. Its waters overflowed the Caspian depression down the Manych-Kerch spillway.Chepalyga A.L., Pirogov A.N.

To fill the Caspian basin to a level of more than would require as much as 70,000 km3 of water, equivalent to 200 years of river discharge into the Caspian Sea. Water flowed through the Manych Spillway (250 to 1,000 km3 per year) and some (more than 100 km3 per year) was lost through evaporation. Water may have come from: * Outburst floods in river valleys * Melting of permafrost * Increased runoff due to permafrost * Greater drainage basin (including Central Asia, now closed) * Decreased evaporation due to winter ice Outburst floods have been inferred from studies of macromeanders in river valleys.Sidorchuk A., Borisova O., Panin A.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. pp. 61-75 Catastrophe The rate of water-level rise during the EEI may be inferred from the duration of the epoch, estimated at five to six hundred years. Assuming an equal length of the phases of rising, high water and subsiding (150 to 200 years each), the sea level would rise by at a rate of at least one meter per year. The Caspian Sea has risen since 1978, as much as per year, with an adverse impact on human activity. The Khvalynean transgression was more catastrophic, especially the rate of coastline shift in the plains of the North Caspian region. The coastline moved from the Atelian coast (near the Mangyshlak sill) north, a year. Even greater was the northward migration of the mouth of the Volga River, which moved more than upstream in 150 to 200 years—more than annually, or about per day. Influence on humans Floodplains and natural spillways influenced human migration. P. M. Dolukhanov of the School of Historical Studies at Newcastle University has concluded that the Caspian-Black Sea spillway across the Kumo- Manych valley isolated the Caucasus and Central Asia. The spread of Upper Paleolithic technology in the region became possible only after the crest of the Upper Khvalynian transgression from 12,500 to 12,000 BP.Arslanov KA, Dolukhanov PM, Gei NA.

Dubbed as \\"The Original Jukebox King\\", he was most famous for hit songs such as \\"What Am I Living For\\", \\"Together Again\\", \\"Two Lovely Flowers\\" and \\"Mardy\\", among others. He died at the peak of his popularity, at the age of 32 after a car accident in the EDSA road in Manila.  Biography  He was born as Edgard Villavicencio Peregrina on November 11, 1944 to Octavio Peregrina of Pililla, Rizal and Nena Villavicencio of Cebu. Eddie started singing in amateur contests as a young child. He won the singing contest of DZXL's \\"Tita Betty's Children Show\\" at the age of six. After he graduated at Villamor Highschool in 1963, He became a professional singer, working as a vocalist for some bands, most notably the Blinkers Band in Japan. His biggest break came when he won the singing contest of Tawag ng Tanghalan, a popular TV variety show of the 60s and 70s.  Singing style  Peregrina's unusually high-pitched voice distinguished him from the rest of popular singers who, at the time, were mostly influenced by the low-pitched, smooth voices of international singers like Matt Monro and Frank Sinatra. He had a habit of tipping his feet backwards to hit the highest note.  Showbiz  Peregrina's popularity was high, particularly among masses. Jukebox, the coin-operated machine which plays selected music, was said to have attained much popularity as well because of continuous requests of Peregrina's songs. His fame surge even more among the Filipino masses when he became movie star, cast with the leading ladies of the 1970s, including Esperanza Fabon, Vilma Santos and Nora Aunor, with whom he had a TV show entitled The Eddie-Nora Show on Channel 9 in the 1960s. Among his movies included Mardy, Memories of Our Dreams with Esperanza Fabon. He co-starred with his wife Lyn Salazar in Batul of Mactan in 1974. He was also the leading man in Dito sa Aking Puso (1970) with Nora Aunor and with Vilma Santos in Mardy. Most of his films were produced by JBC Productions, which invariably paired him with Vilma Santos, Edgar Mortiz, Esperanza Fabon, and directed by Bebong Osorio. When not busy attending show business commitments, he managed his own business, including Edviper Records and the Pervil Photo Studio.  Personal life  Peregrina was married to actress Lyn Salazar, with whom he had two daughters, Edlyn and Michelle. And had also a son named Raymund de Leon to his former manager.  Death  Peregrina was involved in a car accident in 1977 when his Ford Mustang collided with a trailer truck on the EDSA-Shaw underpass. He died a month and a week later (April 30, 1977) at the age of 32 at Polymedic Hospital due to internal hemorrhage caused by the accident.

Retrieved 2 August 2008. Prehistoric Shetland refers to a period in the human occupation of the Shetland archipelago of Scotland that was the latter part of these islands' prehistory. The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus Homo is part of the geology of Scotland. Although some written records refer to Shetland during the Roman invasions of Scotland, prehistory in Shetland does not end until the later part of the Early Historic Period in Scotland, around AD 900. Due to the practice, dating to at least the early Neolithic, of building in stone on virtually treeless islands, Shetland is extremely rich in physical remains of the prehistoric eras and there are over 5,000 archaeological sites all told.Turner (1998) p. 18 Mesolithic and Neolithic A midden site at West Voe on the south coast of Mainland, dated to 4320-4030 BC, has provided the first evidence of Mesolithic human activity in Shetland.Melton, Nigel D. \\"West Voe: A Mesolithic-Neolithic Transition Site in Shetland\\" in Noble et al (2008) pp. 23, 33Melton, N.

Staneydale Temple near Bixter is a large Neolithic ruin containing an oval chamber. Around it are the remains of houses, walls and cairns of the same period. There are numerous Neolithic era standing stones including those at Yoxie on Whalsay and at Boardastubble, Unst. Hjaltadans on Fetlar is a ring of stones, although there are no true stone circles as such in Shetland.Turner (1998) p. 47 Funzie Girt is a remarkable dividing wall that ran for across the island of Fetlar. The level of organisation involved suggest a relatively high population for Shetland in the Neolithic, perhaps as much as 10,000.Turner (1998) p. 26\\"Feltlar, Funziegirt\\" ScotlandsPlaces.

Bronze Age and early Iron Age Broch of Mousa Pottery shards found at the important site of Jarlshof indicate that there was Neolithic activity there although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age.Nicolson (1972) pp. 33-35 This includes a smithy, a cluster of wheelhouses and a later broch. The site has provided evidence of habitation during various phases right up until Viking times.Kirk, William \\"Prehistoric Scotland: The Regional Dimension\\" in Clapperton (1983) p. 106 Numerous brochs were erected during the Iron Age.

Travelers in antiquity In AD 43 and 77 the Roman authors Pomponius Mela and Pliny the Elder referred to the seven islands they call Haemodae and Acmodae respectively, both of which are assumed to be Shetland. Thule is first mentioned by Pytheas of Massilia when he visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC, but it is unlikely he meant Shetland as he believed it was six days sail north of Britain and one day from the frozen sea (description that seems referred more or less with Iceland). However, another early written reference to the Shetland islands may have been when Tacitus reported that the Roman fleet had seen \\"Thule\\" on a voyage that included Orkney in AD 98.\\"The fleet must have sailed on to the Shetlands since ... the only land likely to be visible from ... the Orkney coast would be Fair Isle\\" -- Ogilvie and Richmond, 1967 Watson (1926) states that Tacitus was referring to Shetland, although Breeze (2002) and D. Ellis Evans (1975) are more skeptical (because they think that Tacitus included Shetland in the \\"Orcades islands\\", as the northernmost area of the Orkney archipelago).Breeze, David J. \\"The ancient geography of Scotland\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13Watson (1994) p. 7D. Ellis Evans. \\"Cofiant Agricola: Llywodraethwr Prydain\\" (Wales University Press) The Roman presence in Scotland was little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of partial military occupation \\"within a longer continuum of indigenous development\\"Hanson (2003) pp. 195, 198, 216. The military presence of Rome lasted for little more than 40 years for most of Scotland and only as much as 80 years in total anywhere. At no time was even half of Scotland's land mass under Roman control (if we do not consider Agricola's conquest years) and there is no evidence of any direct contact between Shetland and Roman forces. But for Orkney there are some significant archeological evidences: according to scholars like Montesanti, \\"Orkney might have been one of those areas that suggest direct administration by Imperial Roman procurators, at least for a very short span of time\\".Orcades/Orkney: the 6th roman province in Britannia Later Iron Age Cliffs on St Ninian's Isle The later Iron Age inhabitants of the Northern Isles were probably Pictish, although the historical record is sparse. Hunter (2000) states in relation to King Bridei I of the Picts in the sixth century AD: \\"As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.\\"Hunter (2000) pp. 44, 49 The St Ninian's Isle Treasure was discovered in 1958 by a local schoolboy, Douglas Coutts. Coutts was helping visiting archaeologists led by A. C. O'Dell of Aberdeen University at a dig on the island. The silver bowls, jewellery and other pieces are believed to date from approximately AD 800. O'Dell stated that \\"The treasure is the best survival of Scottish silver metalwork from the period\\" and that \\"the brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms, with both animal-head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal\\".O'Dell, A. et al (December 1959) \\"The St Ninian's Isle Silver Hoard\\".

According to the Orkneyinga Saga, Vikings then used the islands as a base for pirate expeditions against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. In response, Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre (\\"Harald Fair Hair\\") annexed the Northern Isles (comprising Orkney and Shetland) in 875 and Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom in reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland. Some scholars believe that this story is apocryphal and based on the later voyages of Magnus Barelegs. Nonetheless, as the Viking era developed Shetland emerged from the prehistoric period and into the era of written history.Thomson (2008) p. 24-27 References ;Notes ;Footnotes ;General references * Armit, I.

In 2010, a second track was proposed for the Nanjing to Wuhu section.(Chinese) \\"铁道部召开庐铜铁路、宁芜铁路复线预可研审查会\\" 2010-06-28 However, according to the latest news, this railway will remain single track but will be electrified, which will enable freight trains to carry more goods but not improve the average speed on the line. The opening of the Tongling–Jiujiang railway in 2008, extended the line along the southern bank of the Yangtze beyond Tongling all the way to Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province. As of late 2012, published schedules show direct services from Nanjing to Nanchang and points south and west.从南京开往南宁K1191次列车时刻表 (Schedule of train K1191 Nanjing-Nanning [via Tongling, Chizhou, Jiuzhou]) It is now also possible to travel from Shanghai to Chongqing, the capital of R.O.C. between 1937-1945, by train via Shanghai–Nanjing railway, Nanjing–Wuhu–Tongling railway, Tongling–Jiujiang railway, Jiujiang–Wuhan railway, Wuhan–Yichang railway, and Yichang–Chongqing railway. This railway group has become the most important Yangzi River railway system which is along the bank of Yangzi River and across middle part of China from eastern to western parts. It is proposed to reroute the line in the suburbs of Nanjing to run via Nanjing South railway station through a double- track and electrified section, partly in tunnel. The easement of the old line would be used for an extension of line 8 of the Nanjing Metro.

The upper section in the Czech Republic is known as Vilémovský potok in Czech and Wölmsdorfer Bach in German.  Geography  The Sebnitz rises in the Šluknov Hook in a broad valley between the 608-metre-high Hrazený (Pirsken) and the 593-metre-high Plešný (Plissenberg), 2 kilometres northwest of the village of Brtníky (Zeidler). The stream flows in a northwesterly direction to Velký Šenov (Groß Schönau), where it swings southwest and follows the valley of Šenov stream (), passing between Vilémov () and Mikulášovice. Below these villages the Wölmsdorfer Bach between the hills of Spálený vrch (Hillebrand, 443 m) and the Wolfstein (392.9 m) near Dolina (Franzthal) the stream forms the border between the Czech Republic and the tip of the Sebnitz Forest that throws a salient into Bohemian territory. From this section it is known as the Sebnitz or Sebnitzbach. After passing the border crossing of Sebnitz-Dolní Poustevna it continues for several hundred metres along the border before flowing through the town of Sebnitz, named after it, as well as the picturesque Sebnitz valley before uniting with the Polenz after above Porschdorf to form the Lachsbach. With an average discharge of around the Sebnitz can actually be considered the upper section of the Lachsbach, because the Polenz carries less water (discharge: ~). The lower part of the Sebnitz valley is largely known for being the route of the Sebnitz Valley Railway with its 7 tunnels.

The school has a Williamson postal address, but is actually located in Den's Branch at Naugatuck. The mascot is the Panther and the school colors are black and silver. The school has 358 students for athletic purposes and is thus placed in class A for athletic purposes in the state. Upon completion of Mingo Central High School in the fall of 2011, certain students in the Williamson area had the option of which school to attend. This consolidation left Mingo County with just two high schools.  History  Tug Valley High School was opened in 1987 as a consolidation of Lenore High School and Kermit High School. Originally projected to open with 750 students, the school opened with around 650 students as a grade 10-12 high school. The school's grade configuration was changed in 1995 to incorporate the 9th grade for the 1995-96 school year. Tug Valley High was built on the site of the old Waldron Farm in Den's Branch. It originally was designed with two floors with 25 classrooms, a 400 seat auditorium, a state of the art library, a modern gymnasium with a mezzanine, a cafeteria/commons area designed to seat 350, and a seven room administrative office complex. The classrooms on the front and middle portions of the academic wing were designed with removable metal walls to allow for the possibility of utilizing the \\"open-classroom\\" concept to allow for expansion and team teaching. The school had a four classroom addition added to the rear of the academic wing in 1992. This wing was utilized to house the school's Math Department. In 1995 a second four classroom addition was added to the front of the academic wing to further accommodate the increased enrollment due to the change in grade configuration. This wing was used to house the school's English Department. The school was opened with an 1800-seat gymnasium. The school's football field was named \\"Bob Brewer Stadium\\" in honor of a longtime Mingo County Board of Education President who was a lifelong Naugatuck resident and businessman. The football stadium was designed to seat approximately 1,200 and had a press/announcer's box at the top of the \\"home\\" bleachers. The field also doubled as the school's baseball and girls' softball field under a movable configuration design. No concession or restroom areas were originally built. In 1990 a group of community athletic supporters raised funds to build a new facilities building on the field, complete with on-field dressing areas, public restrooms, concession facilities and weight training facilities. However, fundraising did not generate the needed amount, so a scaled down version of the facility was designed and built with public restrooms, concession area and a team filming area overhead, with all other features removed from the original design. In the fall of 2011 plans were announced to build a long-awaited bridge to allow direct access from West Virginia Route 65 to the school facility. As part of those plans, it was announced that 2011 would be the last year the Panthers would play in Bob Brewer Stadium and that immediately following the 2011 football season, work would begin on the building of a new, modernized football stadium for the school that would be closer to the mouth of Den's Branch. New baseball-only and softball-only facilities would be built on the site of Bob Brewer Stadium along with tennis courts and a track. Phase I completion of the new stadium was scheduled for July 2012.  Athletics  Tug Valley has won a total of seven state championships since the school opened in 1987. In basketball, the Panthers have won three; 1999 (Class AA), 2012 (Class AA), and 2013 (Class A). Cheerleading has won four; 2005 (Class A), 2009 (Class AA), 2011 (Class AA), 2012 (Class AA), and 2013 (Class A).

Her performance as the precocious orphan alongside Bing Crosby in Pennies from Heaven (1936) won her critical acclaim. In 1942, she appeared in two Gene Autry films, Heart of the Rio Grande and Stardust on the Sage, which highlighted her fine singing voice. Her acting career was interrupted in the 1940s by serious personal problems, her own life becoming more Dickensian than the characters she portrayed on screen. In the 1980s, she returned to acting with sporadic roles in television series. Between 1929 and 1995, Fellows appeared in over seventy films and television programs. Early years Edith Marilyn Fellows was born on May 20, 1923, in Boston, Massachusetts, the only child of Willis and Harriet Fellows. Her mother abandoned her a few months after her birth. At the age of two, she moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, with her father and her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Fellows. As a toddler, she took dancing lessons to correct her pigeon-toed walk. At the age of four, she was spotted by a supposed talent scout who arranged a Hollywood screen test for fifty dollars. She and her grandmother traveled to Hollywood by train to discover they had been swindled. While her grandmother worked as a housecleaner, she stayed with a local family whose son worked as an extra in movies. She accompanied him to the studio one day. Without being asked, she began dancing and singing in front of the bemused director. When the boy became ill a few days later, the studio sent the message \\"Send the girl.\\" She was soon cast in comedian Charley Chase's film short Movie Night (1929), playing Charley's brat daughter on a family outing to the movies. Additional screen roles soon followed, including Daddy Long Legs (1931), The Rider of Death Valley (1932), two Our Gang comedies, Shivering Shakespeare (1930) and Mush and Milk (1933), and Jane Eyre (1934) for Monogram Pictures, in which she played Mr. Rochester's ward, a precocious matchmaker trying to bring together her guardian and Jane. That same year, Fellows appeared with W C Fields in Mrs Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, playing Australia Wiggs, one of five children being brought up in a shanty town by their poverty-stricken mother whose husband had deserted her. By 1935, she had made over twenty films and was ready for a breakthrough. Child star In 1935, Fellows appeared in Gregory La Cava's She Married Her Boss (1935) as Melvyn Douglas's deceitful daughter who is tamed when Claudette Colbert \\"spanks the daylight out of her\\" with a hairbrush. Her performance landed her a seven-year contract with Columbia Pictures and she became a star at the age of twelve. With her first Columbia films—One-Way Ticket, And So They Were Married, and Tugboat Princess—she continued to be typecast as the orphan or street urchin. In the fall of 1936, her popularity was helped significantly by her co-starring role opposite Bing Crosby in Pennies from Heaven, playing a tough, precocious orphan protected by Crosby's singing vagabond. Whereas in previous films her robust character was tamed by a swift spanking, in this film she is \\"soothed by the crooning of Crosby, particularly the title song sung to her during a thunderstorm.\\" In his review in The New York Times, Frank S. Nugent singled out Fellows's performance writing: Throughout these years, Fellows's grandmother ran her life and career with an iron hand--not allowing her to play with her friends. Eventually, her grandmother isolated her from anyone who might present a negative influence, which appeared nearly everyone, including her father, whom her grandmother sent packing after he joined them in California. In the mid 1930s, Edith's mother arrived at her house after being gone for over a decade, saying she had come for her daughter--and her movie earnings. In the coming months, a bitter custody battle took place, covered by newspapers nationwide in the summer of 1936. Edith’s mother made outrageous claims, saying the girl was abducted by her grandmother--a charge taken seriously in the wake of the Lindbergh kidnapping four years earlier--and that her father once tried to sell her to a dancing school. Edith later recalled having mixed emotions about having to choose between a domineering grandmother and a mother who seemed \\"cold and a little tough.\\" When asked by the court, she chose her grandmother, testifying that she was \\"not used to loving strangers.\\" The judge awarded custody of Edith to her grandmother and ordered her earnings placed in trust. Fellows continued to make films through the early 1940s, but she was no longer a child, and demand for diminutive grownup film actresses (she was 4 feet 10.5 inches in height) was negligible. She wrote the story for what became her last Columbia picture, Her First Beau, and included a sidekick role for her offscreen friend Millie Lou. The script went into production -- only with Jane Withers replacing Fellows as the star, and Fellows reduced to playing \\"Millie Lou.\\" Fellows found work at the smaller, independent studios Monogram Pictures, Republic Pictures, and finally Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC Pictures). Two of the films were Gene Autry westerns (Heart of the Rio Grande and Stardust on the Sage), which showcased her fine singing voice. After the PRC assignment (Girls Town, 1943), she left the screen. Lost years In 1946, Fellows married talent agent Freddie Fields, with whom she had a daughter, Kathy. Fellows turned to the stage, appearing on Broadway in Louisiana Lady, a short-lived 1947 musical. She began acting in television dramas in the early 1950s, appearing in Musical Comedy Time (1950), Studio One in Hollywood (1952), Armstrong Circle Theatre (1952), Tales of Tomorrow (1951–1953), and Medallion Theatre (1954). She also appeared in Uncle Willie, a stage comedy starring Menasha Skulnik that ran for several months in 1956 and 1957. The breakdown of her marriage in the mid 1950s led to a serious psychological crisis. While performing in a charity show in New York in 1958, she became paralyzed with fear and could not go on stage. A psychiatrist diagnosed stage fright and prescribed Librium. Fellows became dependent on the drug, along with Valium and alcohol. The diagnosis marked the beginning of a downward spiral into dependence, interrupted briefly by a second failed marriage that ended when her husband tried to persuade her to return to acting. Penniless, Fellows took a series of jobs as an operator for telephone answering services while sinking deeper into alcoholism and depression. Apart from two minor uncredited roles in films, Fellows did not act again until 1979. Recovery In the late 1970s, Fellows met Rudy Venz, a playwright and director at a Los Angeles community theatre. Venz learned of her story from his girlfriend, who worked with the former child star, and proposed the idea of turning her story into a play, inviting her to star in it. In 1979, Fellows returned to the stage for the first time in decades and appeared in Venz's stage production of Dreams Deferred, overcoming her stage fright. The experience inspired her to make guest appearances on the television series The Brady Brides (1981), Simon & Simon (1982) (as a telephone operator, ironically), Father Murphy (1982), Scarecrow and Mrs. King (1983), Cagney & Lacey (1982–1986), ER (1995), and The Pursuit of Happiness (1995), which was her final performance. She retired from acting in 1995. In her later years, Fellows lived in a courtyard apartment in Hollywood with her three cats. She died of natural causes on June 26, 2011, at the Motion Picture Country Home at the age of 88. She was survived by her daughter, Kathy Fields, and her granddaughter, Natalie Lander.

The election was carried out by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The opposition Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) narrowly defeated the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) and its ally Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA). Background Following the 2009 presidential election, the first ever president from the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), Mauricio Funes, was elected following the end of the Salvadoran civil war. This election was seen as a test of Funes' government since it was the first election since he came to power. Prior to the election, the FMLN controlled the Legislative Assembly in alliance with Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA), dissidents from the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA). Parties In addition to ARENA, FMLN and GANA, six smaller parties fielded candidates. ARENA is led by Alfredo Cristiani, a former president during the civil war; FMLN is led by Medardo González, a former guerrilla chief; and GANA is led by former member of ARENA and president Elías Antonio Saca. The National Conciliation Party and the Christian Democratic Party were both dissolved by a Supreme Court of Justice verdict in 2011. Technically, they would have been deregistered after their electoral setback in 2004 (less than 3%), but a 2005 decree saved them from being folded and allowed them to carry on. The Supreme Court ruled this decree to be unconstitutional and eventually disbanded the parties. However, both parties continued their political work and registered as the National Coalition and Party of Hope, respectively. Campaign ARENA's campaign issues included a tough response to criminal and youth gangs, which was a concern with 14 murders a day, according to government figures. FMLN campaigned on promises of social programmes and job creation, where unemployment is 34% (though down from 40% before Funes took office). In January, Funes appointed army General Francisco Salinas to replace Carlos Ascencio, who had resigned to join the foreign service, as head of the national police. For this, Funes was criticised by members of his own party who alleged that appointing someone from the military to head the police was in contravention of both the Constitution of El Salvador and the Chapultepec Peace Accords. Opinion polls The Central American University carried out an opinion poll which showed the FMLN alliance was leading with 27.8%, but closely followed by ARENA with 26.4%. According to a CID-Gallup poll for the daily newspaper La Página, carried out from 16 to 19 February, ARENA had the support of 34% of voters, FMLN followed with 32% of the voters and GANA, a faction of ARENA, was third with 10% of the voters. Election The voting stations were scheduled to open from 7:00 to 17:00, but many opened late. After voting, Funes called on the electorate to help him \\"guarantee that the changes that are taking place are strengthened, and not turned back.\\" Legislative electionMunicipal elections The election also chose mayors of 262 towns and cities. After the polls closed, but before the Supreme Electoral Tribunal had published the official results, ARENA candidate and the incumbent mayor Norman Quijano declared himself winner of the mayoral race in the capital, San Salvador. He beat the FMLN's Jorge Shafick Handal, the son of former FMLN leader Schafik Handal. Of the 14 district capitals, ARENA won control of nine town halls, FMLN won control of three town halls, while GANA and the National Coalition each won control of one town hall. Reaction San Salvador's re-elected mayor Norman Quijano called the result \\"historic\\" and announced that the party was \\"going to turn the country around.\\" Analysis A strong showing for ARENA was read as a hindrance to Funes' implementation of his pledged social programmes two years before his term ends. The president and his FMLN administration are likely to be dependent on the support of GANA, which has already helped the government with passing fiscal reform bills during the last legislators' term. The Christian Science Monitor read the result as a \\"litmus test\\" for President Mauricio Funes before the next presidential election.http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America- Monitor/2012/0312/El-Salvador-elections-Another-test-for-Latin-America-s-left NotesReferences Category:Elections in El Salvador Category:2012 in El Salvador Category:2012 elections in Central America ","title":"2012 Salvadoran legislative and local elections"},{"id":"31647121","text":"Menter is a surname.

They are later released from jail and immediately contacted by the local pimp gangster, Tap Manson, who wants them to work as hostesses for a company called \\"House by the side of the road, Inc.\\". It is a franchise of motels by the highway roadsides. Head of the company is Mrs. Burke, an old, hardened gangster of a woman who has a deceivingly kind appearance. At first the sisters try to find other jobs, but their search leads nowhere. Eventually they meet with Mrs. Burke and gets hired as hostesses at House 42, one of the motels that is located somewhere in the Midwest. Manson takes them there, together with three other unfortunate girls. Their job is to walk along the highway, pretend to be hitchhikers and lure the drivers in to the combined motel, bar and restaurant. Jane manages to get a ride with Rocky Stone, who understands about the hitchhiking scam but agrees to take Jane anyway. Upon Rocky's arrival to the motel, Manson learns that he has jewels worth $60,000 in his car, and steals them. Rocky believes Jane has taken the jewels and confronts her. After the confrontation, Jane is called in to Mrs. Burke for questioning, and because she doesn't leave the desired answers, she is beaten by the mean old lady. When Edie finds out about her sister's misfortune she decides to take her vengeance on Manson, who tricked them into working at the motel. Unfortunately her plan is overheard by one of the other girls, Rhoda, who reports to Manson. Edie is run over by Manson in his car. Jane is devastated over her sister's death and turns to Rocky for help. They get Manson to admit he killed Edie and confess to the racket Mrs. Burke is running.

The urban area is majorly located in the Nigerian state of Nasarawa, but with some parts stretching into the boundaries of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It has an area of 40,000 hectares (400 km²) and a population of some 2 million. It is one of the fastest growing urban areas in the world, with a growth rate of 40 percent recorded annually. It consists of towns that developed as a result of urban sprawl from Abuja. From west to east, the urban area includes towns like Kurunduma, New Nyanya, Mararaba, New Karu, Ado, Masaka and newer, fast-growing towns such as One Man Village (which contains over 1 million people), New Karshi and Gidan Zakara. Since the beginning of the 20th century, these districts have grown together into a large urban area and a major commercial centre of central Nigeria.  History  In the 1970s, it was decided to relocate Nigeria's capital from Lagos to the centre of the country. The site chosen for the new capital was very close to the villages that made up the present Karu Area, which was a sparsely populated area typical of Nigeria's Middle Belt. In the 1980s, the Nigerian government began transferring its activities to Abuja, and countries began relocating their embassies there. The Economic Community of West African States moved its headquarters to Abuja, and OPEC moved its regional headquarters there. The result was a rapid increase in Abuja's population, which more than doubled in a short time. The Karu area was also affected, as its villages experienced rapid growth due to their close proximity to the new capital.  Growth and urbanisation  In 2003, Mallam Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai, then minister of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria, wished to regain control of the population explosion of Abuja, which had led to the deterioration of the city's infrastructure. He started a campaign of demolition, using bulldozers to demolish structures and clear shanty towns. The campaign made hundreds of thousands of residents homeless, as the remaining decent accommodation was highly priced, and lands approved for residential areas were too expensive for those on an average income, because of Abuja's status as the capital of Africa's oil giant, Nigeria, a country where most people live on less than US$2 a day. These people were thus driven to find affordable accommodation in the neighbouring satellite towns. Because it is so close to Abuja, many of them went to the Karu area, which underwent a population explosion that quickly transformed it into an urban area.  Urban developments of Karu  The rapid growth of the Karu Urban Area began attracting businesses such as banks, hospitality providers and engineering firms, making it more popular than ever and further accelerating its population growth. People from other parts of the country, reluctant to live in the expensive Abuja, came to settle in Karu, which was regarded as a new urban area that grew as a result of Abuja's influence. The towns in the area soon began to merge into a conurbation more than 24 kilometres long, with a population projected to be around 2 million.  Government and administration  The Greater Karu Urban Area is governed by the Karu Local Government in Nasarawa state in Nigeria's middle belt. The Karu Local Government is headed by a chairman elected for a four-year term. It has its headquarters and secretariat in New Karu town. The local government council is responsible for the development of infrastructure in the Karu Urban Area, with the backing of the state government of Nasarawa State. The Esu Karu, the traditional ruler of New Karu, is recognised as a traditional authority in the local government area. He is responsible for settling conflicts among members of the indigenous ethnic groups and serves as the record keeper of the area's history.  Weather and climate  The Greater Karu Urban Area has the tropical savanna climate of central Nigeria, with alternating rainy and dry seasons. The rainy season begins in April and ends in November. Rainfall in the Urban Area is high owing to its location on the windward side of the Jos Plateau and the zone of rising air masses. The annual total rainfall is in the range 1100 –1600 mm.  Health  The Greater Karu Urban Area serves as a health centre for central Nigeria, with many hospitals, medical centres, and clinics.  Economy  The Greater Karu Urban Area has a well-developed banking sector, and many construction firms carrying out a large number of construction projects. It is also emerging as an industrial base. The growing economy and the commercialisation of the Karu Urban Area has given the city a middle-income status.  Transportation  The Karu Urban Area is connected to Abuja by an expressway, which is owned by Nigeria's federal government.  Education  The agglomeration in the Karu area has attracted private investments in education to provide for the growing young and illiterate adult population. The area has a number of primary schools, secondary schools and universities.

Goggi is also an acclaimed singer and her records have always entered the italian pop charts. She reached second place at the 1981 Festival della canzone italiana with the song Maledetta Primavera, her biggest pop hit. Her sister Daniela Goggi is an artist as well, with who co-founded the music disco act Hermanas Goggi, who reached success in the latin markets at the end of the seventies. In the early months of 1973 she was engaged in England for a television show in which she joined Sammy Davis Jr.. In 2006 the American rapper T.I. samples the Goggi's song Molla tutto for his song Get It, contained in the album King, included in the soundtrack of the film Step Up. Loretta Goggi holds some records in the italian television field: during her career she has ventured into numerous imitations of famous people as Celebrity impersonator, both male and female and, although other actresses such as Isabella Biagini had already proposed parodies of famous people on TV, Goggi is recognized as the first imitator woman of italian television, as well as the first to have included elements of satire in the texts within the imitations, thus differentiating the imitation from the mere parody. She was the first woman to conduct a television quiz in Italy, first within in the first edition of Fantastico in 1979, a very popular saturday night show where she conducted a quiz consisting of four games focused on italian songs of the previous 25 years, and subsequently with Loretta Goggi in quiz from 1983 to 1985. Although Mike Bongiorno, between 1979 and 1982 had already conducted some successful programs on Fininvest networks, Goggi is the first Rai star to leave the public company to work on Canale 5 (as well as the first woman): in 1981, in fact, led the first television variety of the newborn network, Hello Goggi. She was also the first woman ever to conduct the Sanremo Festival as main presenter in 1986. She has won four Telegatto in four different categories: best theme song, best quiz, best music transmission and best female personality of the year.  Early life  Born in Rome to Giulio and Costanza Goggi, originally from Circello, she has two sisters: the older Liliana (1943) and the younger Daniela (who will then follow her in the show business). From a very young age Loretta Goggi studied singing and music, great fatherly passions. Noticed by Silvio Gigli, in 1959 she took part in the radio competition, Dino Verde Disco Magico, presented by Corrado with the orchestra conducted by Gianni Ferrio. Loretta wins paired with Nilla Pizzi.  The sixties  In 1962 she made her debut as a child actress in the Rai television prose Sotto processo with the direction of Anton Giulio Majano, broadcast on the Secondo programma. In 1963 at the age of 12 she recorded her first song Se la cercherai, written by Nico Fidenco, with her first name Loretta, for the soundtrack of the french film Le Sang à la tête directed by Gilles Grangier. Subsequently Loretta is in the cast of many other famous Rai television dramas, in which she convincingly interprets characters of fragile and needy girls (many times paired with another child actor, Roberto Chevalier, who later became a well-known voice actor) including Robinson non deve morire (1963) by Vittorio Brignole, Demetrio Pianelli (1963) by Sandro Bolchi, I miserabili (1964), also by Bolchi in which she plays the role of Cosette as a child, Una tragedia americana (1962), Delitto e castigo (1963 ) and La cittadella (1964), all three directed by Anton Giulio Majano, Vita di Dante (1965) by Vittorio Cottafavi, in which she plays Beatrice, Questa sera parla Mark Twain and Scaramouche, with Domenico Modugno, both broadcast in 1965 and directed by Daniele D'Anza and in an episode of Le indagini del Commissario Maigret, directed by Mario Landi (1966). In these dramas Loretta has the opportunity to support great italian actors such as Lilla Brignone, Gino Cervi, Andreina Pagnani, Paolo Stoppa, Rina Morelli, Giorgio Albertazzi and many others. In 1964, under the direction of Beppe Recchia, she was also in the cast of the children's drama C'era una volta la fiaba with Arturo Testa and Santo Versace; of the same year is also Le avventure della squadra di stoppa directed by Alda Grimaldi, another television drama aimed at children Starting in 1965, after having already participated in many television productions, she also dedicated himself to dubbing: it is the italian voice of Tweety in the Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies (flanked by Gigi Proietti, who dubbed Sylvester the Cat), and famous actresses such as Katharine Ross, Kim Darby, Mita Medici, Agostina Belli, Ornella Muti and Silvia Dionisio; in the same period she deepens his studies in diction, piano and singing. During the same period she also began working in the cinema (with small roles) and in the theater, where she played various shows by Molière, William Shakespeare and Luigi Pirandello In 1966 she participated in the Castrocaro Music Festival with the songs Ballando guancia a guancia and So cosa vuoi da me, still unpublished to this day. In 1968 she ventured for the first time with an adult role, taking part as the female protagonist of the play La freccia nera also directed by Anton Giulio Majano and based on the novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson, in which she is flanked by Aldo Reggiani, Arnoldo Foà and Adalberto Maria Merli; the drama is very successful (with peaks of 20 million viewers), and thanks to this Loretta reaches great fame. In the meantime, she graduated from the International Linguistic High School in Rome. She also plays many photo novels in which she is flanked by Massimo Ranieri, Christian, Aldo Reggiani (formerly her partner in The Black Arrow) and Ben Elkland. In 1968 she made her debut as a TV host with the television special Incontro con Lucio Battisti, followed by Il divo Claudio, Notturno di primavera, as well as Radio for schools and she is also a disc jockey on Vatican Radio, she also lends her voice also for some religious audio stories of the Edizioni Paoline. She also returns to singing, publishing several singles with the Durium Records record label, including Cibù Cibà written by Paolo Limiti.  The seventies  In 1970 she began to reveal her skills as an imitator in the TV show Jolly, presented by the Quartetto Cetra. In the summer of the same year Loretta leads the show Estate insieme with Renzo Arbore, promoting emerging bands and solo singers, performing with her sister Daniela in the Boomerang Dance. However, she does not stop acting on television. In 1971 she starred in three television dramas: E le stelle stanno a guardare, always directed by Anton Giulio Majano, in which is accompanied by Giancarlo Giannini, the episode Passi sulla neve of the series Racconti italiani del 900 for the direction of Giuseppe Fina and La sera della partita, directed by Gianni Baldi on the Secondo Programma. She is then alongside Pippo Baudo in the radio program Caccia alla voce, in which she replaces the actor Franco Rosi because he is sick, beginning to perform as an imitator, surprisingly enjoying great success, so much so that the conductor wants her with him in the television variety La freccia d'oro. In the summer of 1971 she participated in the musical event Un disco per l'estate, with the song Io sto vivendo senza te and in november of the same year she participated in the World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, reaching the semifinal. In the spring of 1972 she participated alongside Franco Franchi in the variety Teatro 11, a sort of parody of another italian TV show Teatro 10, and starred in L'ombra del delitto, a television script for Swiss Italian-speaking television. Positively impressed by the work experience with her on the radio and with La freccia d'oro, Pippo Baudo chooses Goggi to support him in the 1972-73 edition of the Canzonissima variety show: on this occasion Loretta fully reveals her talent as an entertainer, especially thanks to her ability to imitate women of show business like Mina, Sophia Loren, Nada, Gina Lollobrigida, Liza Minnelli and many others and for her it is the definitive consecration as a showgirl. Goggi also records the opening theme of the transmission, Vieni via con me (Taratapunzi-e) (written by Marcello Marchesi, Dino Verde, Enrico Simonetti and Pippo Baudo), winning her first gold record and always inside the program, launches other singles like Mani mani and Yeah!. All the songs are included on her first album Vieni via con me. In the early months of 1973 she was hired in England for a TV show in which she joined Sammy Davis Jr. In the autumn of the same year she returned to Italy and, together with the imitator Alighiero Noschese, is in the Saturday night variety Formula due, in which the couple performs a series of imitations and parodies and in which Loretta sings the theme song initial Molla tutto and promotes her second album, entitled Formula 2; this variety was the most popular italian television program of 1973, with an average of 26 million viewers and it was also one of the first color TV shows experimentally recorded by Rai. In 1974 Loretta realizes her first live solo show at Bussola, Sergio Bernardini's Versilia club and in the same year publishes four singles produced by her manager Enrico Polito and Totò Savio, the latter then becoming Loretta's musical author until 1985. In 1976 Goggi is still on Rai with Dal primo momento che ho ti visto, a curious mix of musical drama and television variety broadcast by Rete 1 (today's Rai 1), of which she is the protagonist together with Massimo Ranieri; in the program Loretta interprets the songs Notte matta, Dirtelo, non dirtelo and Ma chi sei? (the latter italian cover of the disco-music song Lady Bump by Penny McLean), which all enter hit-parade, enjoying great success. Immediately after the end of the program, Goggi begins a long summer tour. In 1977 the new single, Ancora inamorati, is distributed not only in Italy but also in Greece, Germany, Spain and the United States, the B side contains the song Monsieur voulez-vous dançer?, a song from the disco-music vein, much in vogue at that time. Once the contract with the producer and manager Polito has expired, Loretta Goggi starts her own business with her sister Daniela for an artistic duo. The couple therefore travels around Italy with the Go & Go show and a disco-music single, Domani, which was very successful. In 1978, the Goggi sisters together with Pippo Franco, Oreste Lionello and the whole Bagaglino company, directed by Antonello Falqui, made the television variety Il ribaltone broadcast on Rai's Network 1, in which they sing the final theme Voglia. The program wins the Rosa d'Argento prize at the Montreux Festival in Switzerland as the best European television broadcast of the year. Later the couple Goggi resumed the tour also in the rest of Europe. In Spain they publishes the album Estoy bailando cantado en español (never released in Italy) and the homonymous single, spanish version of the song Sto ballando, previously recorded by Daniela alone (although sometimes the two sisters will perform together also in the version in the italian version), which ends at the top of the iberian hit parade and in those of many other spanish-speaking countries. In the autumn of the same year, Loretta returned to work as a soloist on television, conducting on Rai 1 the first edition of the saturday night variety Fantastico, combined with the Italian Lottery, together with Beppe Grillo and the then newcomer Heather Parisi, directed by Enzo Trapani. The program is very successful, achieving an average of 26 million viewers; here she launches one of his most well-known but also vocally demanding songs: L'aria del sabato sera, which is used as the closing theme of the transmission, which brings Goggi back to the top of the italian musical hit-parade, in which she was simultaneously present also with Cicciottella, a song destined for children, written for her by Bruno Lauzi and Pippo Caruso, used as the theme song for the sunday variety Fantastico bis, a spin-off of the program she conducted, presented by Pippo Baudo. In july 1979, she appeared on the cover of the italian issue of Playboy, photographed by Roberto Rocchi. In December of the same year she also appears on the cover of Radiocorriere TV as godmother of the newborn Rai 3. For work needs in that period she moved from Rome to Milan, a transfer that from temporary will become definitive. During the making of Fantastico, Loretta met the dancer and choreographer Gianni Brezza, recently separated from his wife, who became her partner and with whom he married in 2008, after 29 years of living together. Brezza became her manager, press officer, PR, choreographer and director until 2010 and look-maker and photographer (in the latter two cases only until 1983). For the magazine Bolero, Loretta and Gianni together interpret the photo novel Love on the high seas.  The eighties  In 1980 Loretta published the summer single Notti d'agosto, written for her by her dear friend Franco Califano and embarked on a new international tour with her sister Daniela entitled Supergoggi which goes up to the countries of Latin America. In the same year, again with her sister Daniela, she is also the protagonist of an episode of the successful television variety Giochiamo al varieté, directed by Antonello Falqui broadcast on Rai's Network 1, in which the two sisters play famous couples of the italian and international show business. In 1981 she participated as a singer in the competition at the Sanremo Festival with her most famous song, Maledetta primavera, winning second place in the final ranking. Cursed spring will prove to be an international hit that sells over two million copies (of which many covers will be recorded in various foreign languages), receiving the gold disc and the platinum disc, soon becoming an evergreen of italian music The album containing Maledetta primavera, entitled Il mio prossimo amore, was released in the autumn of the same year, on the occasion of the TV show Hello Goggi, an early evening variety totally focused on Loretta and her imitations, which marks her passage from Rai to the then newborn Canale 5 (of which Hello Goggi was absolutely the first variety show). The album consists of nine songs, some of which have already been published. However, two songs included in the TV show will only be released on CD in 2000. The song-title of the album is used as the final theme of the show and the disc, thanks to the promotion made during the episodes of the variety, reaches the top of the musical charts. In 1981 Loretta is also a protagonist in the theater, alongside Gigi Proietti (already his partner at the time of the dubbing), of the italian edition of the They're Playing Our Song musical. A soundtrack of the same name is then released, containing all the songs of the show, in the italian adaptation written by Carla Vistarini. In the spring of 1983 Loretta went from Canale 5 to Rete 4 (a television station owned by the Arnoldo Mondadori Editore group at the time), where she conducted, together with Paolo Panelli and Luciano Salce, Gran varietà, a show on the early evening of sunday. Within the program, Goggi presents her new album with an autobiographical and existential cut, Pieno d'amore; among the songs of the album that are the most successful, in addition to the song that gives the title to the disc, which reaches the top places in the hit parade, she recorded Oceano, a single used as the closing theme of the show. The songs will be promoted in numerous other television programs of the period in many radio programs. In December 1983 Loretta returns to Rai where until 1985 she is the protagonist on Rai 1 as a brilliant presenter of the game show Loretta Goggi in quiz (broadcast firs on friday, and in the second edition on thursday), the first game show ever presented by a woman in Italy, under the direction of Emilio Uberti (in the first edition) and Gianni Brezza (in the second) who in 1984 won the Telegatto for Best quiz. Two other songs by Goggi are chosen as the final theme of the two seasons of the program: in the first Una notte così, and in the second Notte all'opera. In 1984 she recorded the song Un amore grande, written by Umberto Tozzi and Giancarlo Bigazzi and programmed to go to the competition at the Sanremo Festival, but Loretta gave up at the last moment her participation comunicating that with an ANSA press release. It will be replaced by Pupo, who at that time was the author and music producer of his sister Daniela. However, the song is also recorded on disk by Loretta, who later promotes it in various television programs. She returned to Sanremo in 1986, this time however as host of the 36th edition of the Festival: Goggi is the first woman to lead the event as the main presenter, achieving great success in terms of audience. For her Mango (one of the artists competing in that edition) writes the song Io nascerò, which is used as the initial theme of the singing festival (and later included in the album C'è poesia); the song soon became a gold disc, thus beating many sales songs competing at the Festival of that year. In the mid-eighties there was a decisive turning point in the choice of Loretta's repertoire: in fact, she abandoned Totò Savio as a songwriter and went to the Fonit Cetra label and relied on the producer Mario Lavezzi, starting to interpret songs written by prestigious authors including Bruno Lauzi, Donatella Rettore, Ron, Zucchero Fornaciari, Dario Baldan Bembo, Enrico Ruggeri, Gianni Togni, Umberto Tozzi, Paolo Conte and Gianni Bella. After the Sanremo experience, Loretta continues her television career, creating many successful programs broadcast by Rai 1 including Il bello della diretta, in spring 1986 on the thursday prime time, in which she also presents her album, C'è poesia.

His name is associated with a malady known as Marjolin's ulcer. After a brief stint in the French military, he attached himself to a physician, a friend of the family who allowed Marjolin to attend Commercy Hospital as a student. In 1800 he relocated to Paris with a letter of recommendation from Alexis Boyer (1757–1833). Here he became a favoured disciple of Guillaume Dupuytren (1777–1835). In 1803 he gained his internship, followed by promotions as an anatomy assistant (1805) and prosector (1806). In 1808 he earned his medical doctorate, and two years later opened an amphitheater on Rue des Rats (today- Rue Colbert). Here he taught classes that numbered more than 200 pupils. In 1816 he was appointed second surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris with Dupuytren as departmental head. By this time Marjolin's relationship with Dupuytren had soured, eventually leading to bitter hatred between the two men. In 1818 he was chosen professor of external pathology ahead of esteemed candidates that included Philibert Joseph Roux (1780–1854), Dominique Larrey (1766–1842) and Jules Germain Cloquet (1790–1883). For the next thirty two years he maintained the chair of external pathology. His final days were spent in retirement at Clichy, where he pursued his hobby attending to trees and flowers. In 1820 he became a member of the Académie de Médecine, and in 1830 was chosen consultant surgeon to Louis-Philippe. His son, René, married Cornelia Scheffer, daughter of painter Ary Scheffer (1795–1858).

In 1946, the reigning Archbishop of Kochi, Most Rev Dr Joseph Attippetty, who was the first Indian Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Verapoly, decided to upgrade the High school to a full- fledged college, by starting St. Albert's College, which temporarily functioned in the Boys school campus. In 1950, the campus of the college was shifted to land opposite and St. Albert's boys school remained in its original campus with increased facilities. The original school campus was designed in Grand Victorian architecture in traditional Gothic style. A second structure resembling the original structure was commissioned in 1958 near to the old campus in addition to Pagoda styled buildings for lower classes behind the heritage structure. St. Albert's Group grew with more than 20 schools and 5 higher colleges along with a medical college and nursing home. In 2005, as part of increasing business developments in Kochi and Kerala as a whole, St. Albert's college started a Business school to create management professionals.

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Protanthea. Description P. simplex is a delicate sea anemone. The tentacles are non-retractable and have a frosty appearance and are usually held outstretched. The column is salmon pink, flared below the tentacles and reaches lengths of up to two centimetres. It has a flattened, lightly adherent base bulging out below the pedal disc. There are up to 200 slender, translucent, white or pale pink tentacles up to one and a half centimetres long arranged in five rings. When the orangeish-pink gonads are ripe, they may be visible through the wall of the column. Distribution This species is found in both shallow and deep water around the western coast of Scotland from the Firth of Clyde northward, particularly in sea lochs. It is also found round the coasts of the Skagerrak and northern Kattegat and in one location in Connemara, Galway, Ireland. It seems to prefer vertical rock faces in sheltered sites with little movement of water and has been found as deep as five hundred metres. Biology This species is a passive suspension feeder. It is often solitary but it has been recorded at densities of up to two thousand per square metre. It shows an unusual behaviour when occasionally it loses muscle tone and hangs limply from its pedal disc attachment. At other times it is very active, exhibiting a violent thrashing of the tentacles in response to external stimuli. Reproduction can be by sexual or asexual means. In sexual reproduction, eggs and sperm are ejected through the mouth and liberated into the sea. The fertilised egg develops into a planula, which settles after fifteen to twenty days and grows into a new individual. In asexual reproduction, fragments of the column are capable of regenerating into new individuals.Manuel, R.L., (1988). British Anthozoa. London: Academic Press.

M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 7 He also made him chief disciple at Gnananda Tapovanam circa 1960s commanding him to spread nama sankirtana through the world. Swami had a number of accomplished disciples through his abnormally long tenure- Bramanamda who took samadhi at Puskar, Achutadasa of Polur. He loved obsurity. He changed identity to avoid being recognised . Birth and childhood Sources report his birth as early 19th century in the village Mangalapuri in North Kanara District of Karnataka.Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 6 to an orthodox Brahmin couple, Venkoba Ganapati and SriMathi Sakku Bai. He was named Subramanyam at birth, and left his home at a very early age. His birthday is celebrated on the birth star of Kritika in January (the Tamil month of Thai). Sanyasa Sivaratna Giri Swami accepted Subramanyam as his disciple and named him Pragnana Brahmachari.Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 8 Sivaratna Giri initiated Gnanananda in the traditional manner into the Giri order of Jyotir Mutt and gave him the monastic name of Sri Gnanananda Giri.Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – 363 pages Sivaratna Gnanananda adorned the 6th lineage of Peetam of Jagadguru Totakacharya for some time. However he nominated one Ananda Giri in his place and retired to the height of the Himalayas for penance. Gnananda spent many years at the sacred spot of Gangotri and icy caves of the Himalayas in intense tapas. He travelled extensively on foot, spanning the whole India and Tibet, Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Malaya. He met many holy men over the course of his pilgrimage. Teaching and establishment of ashrams Gnanananda returned to India and established an ashram at Attayampatti in Salem and then at Siddhalingamadam near Villupuram.Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – page 17 The most famous ashram, named \\"Sri Gnanananda Tapovanam\\", is situated two miles away from Tirukkoyilur. Gnanananda built temples for the deities of Gnanaganesa, Gnanaskandan, Gananapurisa, Gnanambika, Mahalaksmi, Gnana Venugopala, Gnana Bhairavar and Gnana AnjaneyanShiva in Tapovanam. Another ashram was constructed in Yercaud, a hill station near Salem.Sadguru Gnanananda, his life, personality, and teachings/T. M. P. Mahadevan – 1979 – 89–90 pages It was called \\"Pranavanilayam\\". This was a retreat for contemplatives. Giri wanted to develop it as a centre for comparative religion. In contrast to Tapovanam, no rituals were permitted in Yercaud. The central emphasis was on meditation and dhyana. Giri taught a number of paths based on the aptitude of his disciples. Therefore, some of disciples are conversant in the \\"path of knowledge\\" (jñāna-marga) while others are the \\"path of works\\" (karma-marga) and still others follow the \\"path of faith\\" (bhakti-marga). His senior monastic disciple Vidyananda Giri was a profound scholar and linguist and brought out Tamil translations of Shankara's commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads. He also made available Tamil versions of famous Advaitic texts like Sanatsujatiyam. He trained followers in Advaitic Nidhidhyasana. Another of his lineage, Satyananda was associated with Franklin Merrell-Wolff and taught his method of \\"introceptive knowledge\\". Giri realised that the path of Vichara and Nidhidhyasana was confined to a few philosophically advanced aspirants. For devotees at a lesser level, he advocated stuti, japa and nama sankirtan. He was well versed in all the modes of Bhajana Sampradaya and he held that Hari Bhajana for ordinary devotees was the easiest way to attain \\"Moksha\\". He had chosen Haridas Giri propagated the importance of Namasankeetanam.

The boy later became known as \\"Swami Haridhos Giri\\" on being initiated in sanyasa. Haridhos carried his guru's (Gnianananda's) sandals (Paadhuka) with him to all the holy places he went to. He also visited many holy places with his Guru Paadhuka to propagate the importance of singing god's praises (\\"NamaSankeerthanam\\") as instructed by his guru. As part of spreading the cult of Namasankeerthanam, Giri established Mandalis and Samajams in various countries.. The other disciple of Swami Gnanananda Sri. Hariharan Giri, (the fond disciple of Swami.Gnanananda) assumed a very low profile life and settled in Erode, Tamilnadu and helps mankind to this date from various ailments.

It is supported by the Federal Republic of Germany and its states and is a member of the Leibniz Association of German research institutions. The institution studies the Old World and its contact zones from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. It consists of several divisions, and in addition maintains a permanent collection and through this and its numerous publications and conferences, disseminates the findings of recent research to the public. History The Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum was founded in 1852 by Ludwig Lindenschmit the Elder, after the decision was taken at the 16-19 August Versammlung deutscher Geschichts- und Alterthumsforscher (Assembly of German Researchers in History and Classical Studies) in Dresden that a \\"central museum for Germanic and Roman artifacts\\" should be founded in Mainz and a \\"Germanic museum\\" should be founded in Nuremberg (the Germanisches Nationalmuseum). It was no accident that the museum was established in the city of Mainz, with its high importance in the Middle Ages, and housed in the Electoral Palace; rather these decisions symbolised the museum's national aspirations in the era of the German Confederation. In the early years of its existence, the museum faced considerable financial and organisational problems: the support which had been promised by the historical association failed to materialise, and instead the Nuremberg museum was promised exclusivity and the governing board of the Mainz museum were pressured to amalgamate with it. Only after the foundation of the German Empire in 1871 did the museum receive an annual budget, which also made it possible for Lindenschmit to make his work there his primary pursuit; until then, he had also worked as a drawing teacher. After his death, his son Ludwig Lindenschmit the Younger took over the leadership. In 1900 became the first director of the museum, a position which he would hold for 25 years. He increased its size from four to 27 rooms of exhibits, had further copies and reconstructions created in the museum's own workshop and published 297 works under his own name in addition to numerous catalogues, in particular the three-volume Siedlungs- und Kulturgeschichte der Rheinlande.Karl Schumacher, Siedelungs- und Kulturgeschichte der Rheinlande von der Urzeit bis in das Mittelalter, Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz Handbücher 1-3, Mainz: Wilckens, 1921-25, Volume 1 Die vorrömische Zeit, volume 2 Die römische Periode, volume 3 Die merowingische und karolingische Zeit. The elder Lindenschmit conceived of the museum as a research collection of copies, which would include all significant finds made in Germany, or even the whole of Europe, in order to facilitate comparative studies. The museum in Mainz still has the character of a research collection, aimed more at scholars and those interested in the field than at the public in general. In recent years, the museum has also offered \\"programmes for instructors\\" and special exhibitions devoted to current research. Although the institution has at times also taken some responsibility for heritage preservation in Rhenish Hesse, including conducting their own excavations, the restoration workshops still constitute today the foundation of their scholarly work, while field investigations are primarily conducted by the annexes in Neuwied and Mayen. In early December 2007, the museum announced plans for a new building on the southern edge of Mainz, next to the Museum of Ancient Seafaring which is one of its annexes. \\"Neubau des RGZM: In Mainz soll ein neues archäologisches Zentrum entstehen\\", Press release, Rhineland-Palatinate State Ministry of Education, Science, Youth and Culture, 4 December 2007, at News, RGZM.de Some major German archaeologists have worked and work at the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, including Ludwig Lindenschmit the Younger, Paul Reinecke, Friedrich Behn, Kurt Böhner, Konrad Weidemann, Markus Egg and Falko Daim. Alexandra W. Busch has been Director General since October 2018. Research emphases Researchers from different divisions work together on emphasised themes which cross boundaries between divisions and periods: * Early hominid expansions and the colonisation of western Eurasia (e.g., excavation of the find of homo georgicus at Dmanisi in Georgia) * Studies on the emergence and development of big-game hunting * Systems of settlement and internal organisation of settlements in the Paleolithic and Mesolithic * Mediterranean traditions in shipbuilding in Western, Central and Northern Europe * Forms of Romanisation in the northern border provinces of the Roman Empire, from Britannia to the Black Sea * Studies in the structure and genesis of elites in prehistoric and early societies * Prehistoric and early historical hoards * The development of an industrial landscape * The ancient quarrying and mining region between the Eifel and the Rhine * Transformation and cultural exchange on the fringes of the Mediterranean world In presenting research, the museum works closely with the Volcano Park in Mayen-Koblenz. One emphasis is research into the use of volcanic rock as building materials and for millstones, particularly in the Roman period. Rock from the Eastern Eifel was used to build the Roman settlement of Colonia Ulpia Traiana at Xanten and was exported as far as southern Scandinavia.

The dress was held together by several oversized gold safety pins. The dress is perhaps Versace's best-known creation, and is considered by some to be largely responsible for launching Hurley onto the global media stage. Background In advance of the premiere for Four Weddings and a Funeral and as a newcomer to high profile premieres, Grant had been told that he and his partner would be able to borrow designer clothing to wear to such an event. Inexperienced in such matters and relatively unknown, Hurley contacted various fashion houses asking for such a loan but was rebuffed several times because they did not know who she was. Finally, Versace agreed to loan a dress. Design The black dress was made from pieces of silk and lycra fabric, with oversized gold safety pins placed at \\"strategical places\\". The dress was wide open at the front, from the neck down to halfway across the bosom, with two slimline straps on the shoulders. Each side was connected by a gold safety pin and two cut-away parts on both sides that were held together with six gold safety pins on each side and one at the top of the cut-away on each side connecting it to the bosom section. The dress is said to be punk-inspired, \\"neo-punk\\", and something which \\"emerged from the sari development\\" according to Gianni Versace himself. Influence The dress is perhaps Versace's best-known creation, as it received considerable global coverage in newspapers and magazines around the world for a long time after the event and was credited for boosting Hurley's profile, hurling her from being a virtually unknown actress to worldwide media recognition. Hurley has also been credited for making the Versace fashion brand a household name. The brand has since, with its omnipresent Medusa-head logo, \\"defined the paradoxes of a controversial, new-generation feminism which celebrates empowerment in the act of attracting and manipulating a male gaze.\\" The dress topped a 2008 Debenhams' poll that asked 3,000 women to select their favourite iconic red-carpet dress. In 2007, a copy of the dress worn by Hurley was put on sale for the first time – with a price tag of £10,690 – at Harrods, as part of an exhibition dedicated to \\"the little black dress\\" at the London store. The exhibition included the famous black dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1963 movie Charade, as part of the Harrods Timeless Luxury promotion. In 2012, pop singer Lady Gaga wore the dress to meet Donatella Versace in Milan.\\"Lady Gaga dares to wear That Dress\\", theguardian.com, 3 October 2012 Gaga promoted Versace by wearing archive pieces in her music video for the song \\"The Edge of Glory\\". Controversy Hurley said of the dress, \\"That dress was a favour from Versace because I couldn't afford to buy one. His [Gianni Versace's] people told me they didn't have any evening wear, but there was one item left in their press office. So I tried it on and that was it.\\" However, some viewed the dress as too lewd or distastefully revealing. Hurley said in response to comments about the revealing nature of the dress, \\"Unlike many other designers, Versace designs clothes to celebrate the female form rather than eliminate it.\\" References Category:1990s fashion Category:Individual dresses Category:Punk fashion Category:Versace Category:1994 clothing ","title":"Black Versace dress of Elizabeth Hurley"},{"id":"31647736","text":"C.V.V.

Producer Chips Moman asked James L. Dickerson, a reporter with The Commercial Appeal newspaper in Memphis, if he would create a magazine that could be used as part of a sales package for a telemarketing campaign for the album. Dickerson agreed to do it without fee if Moman would allow him to name the magazine, copyright it, and use it to launch a bi-monthly music magazine. Moman agreed, and the magazine was named Nine-O-One Network, the name derived from Memphis's telephone area code, 901.Dickerson, James L.

By the end of the first year, the full-color, slick paper magazine had newsstand circulation in fourteen states. By the end of 1987 it was sold on newsstands in all 50 states and throughout Canada, and in selected cities in Portugal, Japan, Australia and the Soviet Union. The distributor was Capital Distribution Co. of Derby, Connecticut. At its peak, the magazine had a circulation of 100,000 which made it the third-largest music magazine in the United States, behind Rolling Stone and Spin.Grantham, Lee (August 27, 1987). \\"Nine-O-One Network Emphasizes Memphis Music\\". The Daily News (Memphis). p. 1. Initially, the magazine was financed by Dickerson, who used his savings and cashed in his life insurance policy to live on and pay start-up costs. The magazine was incorporated in the State of Tennessee and preferred common stock was offered, all of it purchased by 25 Mississippi and Tennessee investors. The first issue featured a photograph of Cash, Perkins, Orbison and Lewis. The second issue featured Rolling Stone Ron Wood as the cover story, with inside articles about Belinda Carlisle, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Steve Wariner and Sweethearts of the Rodeo. The eclectic mix reflected the magazine's philosophy that a true American music magazine should contain articles about all the major forms of native music rock and roll, country, blues and jazz.

Goad is most noted for his insurance surveys of cities in Canada, Great Britain, and elsewhere. Fire insurance companies needed to know in detail the nature and size of buildings, width of streets, construction, building materials and the proximity of fire services and water supplies in order to estimate appropriate premiums. Goad established a company (the Charles E. Goad Company) in 1875 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to produce maps to provide this information. These and like maps are now referred to as Goad maps.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Mayo unless stated otherwise.

Instant-off enables users of such devices to immediately power down their hardware without enduring the long and often arduous waiting process typically associated with laptops that are not Instant-off enabled. Whilst such a feature could technically be incorporated into inferior mainstream consumer models, the high cost and low level of user education associated with this market are prohibitive. Benefits The benefits of Instant-off are primarily concerned with the protection of information. For example, it is company policy at most Fortune 500 corporations that the CEO and other high ranking corporate officers use only laptops that are Instant-off enabled in order to protect commercially sensitive information in the event that someone attempts to observe the screen over the shoulder of the officer. Implementation Instant-off is usually implemented in devices following the principles of stealth. As such, the trigger for the Instant-off process will normally be hidden in a location without any distinguishing features to alert other users to its presence; the archetypal location for the trigger being the power cord of the laptop, with the removal of said power cord activating the Instant-off process and leading to the complete shutdown of the system within 1.5 seconds. Whilst locating the trigger in such an easily accessible component of the laptop does lead to occasional accidental activations, the benefits of hiding the feature in plain sight - which allows it to be activated within seconds of the alarm being raised - are generally thought to more than compensate for this one perceived drawback.

The soldier, Damas Pakedeh, was arrested and then released, after being accused of attacking the policeman. Pakada believes the incident was racially motivated and that if the video had not been taken, he would have been punished. Instead, the police officer was fired.

Background \\"Just a Little Bit\\" was developed when Rosco Gordon was touring with West Coast blues artist Jimmy McCracklin. According to Gordon, McCracklin started to write the song and agreed that Gordon could finish it, with both of them sharing the credit. Gordon later presented a demo version to Ralph Bass at King Records, who was reportedly uninterested in the song. Gordon then approached Calvin Carter at Vee-Jay Records, who agreed to record it. Meanwhile, Federal Records, a King Records subsidiary, released a version of \\"Just a Little Bit\\" by R&B; singer Tiny Topsy (1959 Federal 45-12357),Gordon recalled this as taking place in 1958; Billboard shows the releases in 1959. with songwriting credit given to Ralph Bass and several others unknown to Gordon. The Tiny Topsy song, featuring a pop-style arrangement with background singers and flute, did not reach the record charts. Rosco Gordon song Rosco Gordon's \\"Just a Little Bit\\" was released in late 1959 and entered the Billboard R&B; chart in February 1960. An early review described the song as \\"a rhymba [rhumba] blues\\", a reference to Gordon's \\"slightly shambolic, loping style of piano shuffle called 'Rosco's Rhythm'\\". The original Vee-Jay single lists Gordon as the songwriter, although some later issues (and versions by other artists) list Bass and others as the writers. \\"Just a Little Bit\\" was Rosco Gordon's fourth (and last) single to enter the R&B; chart, where it reached number two during a stay of seventeen weeks in 1960.Whitburn 1988, p. 170. \\"Just a Little Bit\\" also appeared in the Hot 100 at number 64, making it Gordon's only song to enter the pop chart.

Several musicians have recorded \\"Just a Little Bit\\". In 1965, Roy Head had a Top 40 pop hit with the song and when Little Milton recorded it in 1969, it reached number 13 in the Hot R&B; Sides chart and number 97 in the Hot 100 chart.Whitburn 1988, p. 259.

Terence Mongan was Chaplain of the 62nd Regiment of Foot, before which point he was using the name Charles Mongan.62nd Regiment of Foot He adopted the surname of Warburton (with the forenames Charles Mongan, or possibly Terrence Charles Mongan) by Royal Warrant in 1792 and, after serving as Dean of Ardagh (1790–1800) and then Clonmacnoise (1800–1806) was consecrated Bishop of Limerick on 13 July 1806. He translated to Cloyne in 1820Cork Anglican and died in post on 9 August 1826, aged 72.Genealogical Web Site Arthur O'Neill in his memoirs gives the following interesting account of Mongan and his family- \\"In my travels I became acquainted with a Dominic Mungan, I may say I had known him since I was twelve years old. He was born blind in the County of Tyrone, and a real good harper. He was a Roman Catholic. I presume my following reason will plead an apology for mentioning his religion. He was a great economist, but would spend money as genteelly as any man occasionally. He had three sons, Mark, John, and Terence, whom he educated in the first style. Mark was educated for a priest, and finished his studies in France, in the College of Lombard, where he obtained upwards of forty premiums for his translations of Greek into French. After he finished his studies he came home, but in consequence of his intense application he fell into a decay, and died in his father's house in Strabane. John, the second son, was bred a physician, and practised in and about Monaghan, and the adjacent country, with good reputation. About five years ago as he was returning from the races of Middleton in Monaghan in his gig he was upset and smashed to pieces. Terence, the third and youngest son, is now Bishop of Limerick, and was formerly Dean of Ardagh. He had a good delivery, sung well, and acquired great interest. He and a priest O'Beirne, who was Chaplain to Lord Fitzwilliam when Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland, were promoted to their present ranks of Protestant Bishops. Now my reason for mentioning the Roman Catholic persuasion is this, that the doctor and the bishop both read their recantations; the doctor before and the bishop after their father's death. He in his lifetime used to travel the north-west circuit with his harp, and at one time, as he was playing for one of the Judges, he asked Dominic his reasons for not speaking to his son, the doctor, since he turned Protestant. 'My Lord' says Dominic, 'I spared no expense on him when he was unable to provide for himself; and assure your Lordship, I am no bigot; but I think it was his duty to consult me before he changed his religion. It was not, however, for the sake of religion he did so, but he fell in love with a young lady who was a Protestant. She informed him she could not have him as he was a Papist, on which he read his recantation, and then demanded her hand, on which, to his mortification, she scornfully informed him that she would be sorry to marry a turncoat.\\"['MEMOIRS OF ARTHUR O'NEILL' on page 163 of 'Annals of the Irish Harpers' by Charlotte Milligan Fox] References Category:1754 births Category:1826 deaths Category:Bishops of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe Category:Anglican bishops of Cloyne Category:Deans of Ardagh Category:Deans of Clonmacnoise ","title":"Charles Warburton"},{"id":"31648547","text":"Colatina Sociedade Esportiva, commonly known as Colatina, is a Brazilian football club based in Colatina, Espírito Santo state.

As the Grünbach stream passes through a particularly narrow, gorge-like section of the Amselgrund valley it plunges over the largest step in the river bed - roughly 10 m high - forming a wide spray of water that pours over the Amselloch, a collapsed cave. The roof of this cave was made of sandstone blocks that have collapsed. In the ravine and in the cave potholes and kolks bear witness to the meltwaters that coursed down into the River Elbe during earlier ice ages. The original stream (first mentioned in 1548) flowed almost entirely through the cave, but in the 19th century it had been diverted over the top of the cave to the cascade site. The waterfall was additionally, like the Lichtenhain Waterfall, arranged to flow through a small, controllable weir wicket in order to produce a stream-like torrent, in order to enhance its touristic attraction. In the immediate vicinity of the waterfall is the Amselfall mountain hut with an inn and next to it is the information office of the Saxon Switzerland National Park opened in 1992.

From 1995 to 1997 he attended the German General Staff Course at the Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr in Hamburg, being awarded the Heusinger prize for the best German graduate. Having finished the studies in Hamburg, Kiesewetter was posted at the European Council, the NATO Headquarters in Brussels and Mons as well as in the German Ministry of Defence. Besides that he also used to be commander of a German army battalion and took part in different military missions abroad. From 2006 to 2009 he was head of the offices of the then Chiefs of Staff of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, Rainer Schuwirth and Karl-Heinz Lather in Brunssum, Belgium. In 2009 he had a post at the Rapid Reaction Forces Operations Command (Kommando operative Führung Eingreifkräfte), until he was elected member of parliament on 17 October 2009 and left the army as a colonel. Political career Kiesewetter has been a member of the German Bundestag since the 2009 federal elections. In the Bundestag, Kiesewetter is a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs as well as deputy chairman of the Sub-Committee for Disarmament, Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. In his parliamentary group he serves as spokesman for disarmament and on civilian crisis prevention. Within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he is his group's rapporteur on the Balkans, the Mediterranean and Maghreb countries; he previously also covered energy policy. In the negotiations to form a coalition government following the 2013 federal elections, Kiesewetter was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on foreign affairs, defense policy and development cooperation, led by Thomas de Maizière and Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Between 2014 and 2015, Kiesewetter represented the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in a crossparty committee headed by former defense minister Volker Rühe to review the country's parliamentary rules on military deployments.Jan Techau (17 June 2014), Germany’s Budding Defense Debate Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

In September 2020, Kiesewetter was one of 15 members of his parliamentary group who joined Norbert Röttgen in writing an open letter to Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer which called on Germany and other EU counties to take in 5000 immigrants who were left without shelter after fires gutted the overcrowded Mória Reception and Identification Centre on the Greek island of Lesbos.Robert Roßmann (September 12, 2020), Röttgen fordert stärkere Hilfsbereitschaft Deutschlands im Fall Moria Süddeutsche Zeitung. Defence policy In 2012, Kiesewetter and Andreas Schockenhoff proposed in a strategy paper a reform of the requirement of parliamentary approval when sending Bundeswehr soldiers abroad, suggesting instead to introduce a yearly, general parliamentary decision on German participation in integrated military structures, such as AWACS, EU Battlegroups and the NATO Response Force (NRF). The government would then have a right to deploy, while the Bundestag would have the right to recall the troops.Margriet Drent (March 2014), Clingendael Report March 2014: Sovereignty, parliamentary involvement and European defence cooperation Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael, The Hague.

Relations with Russia In August 2012, Kiesewetter was one of 124 members of the Bundestag to sign a letter that was sent to the Russian ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin, expressing concern over the trial against the three members of Pussy riot. \\"Being held in detention for months and the threat of lengthy punishment are draconian and disproportionate,\\" the lawmakers said in the letter. \\"In a secular and pluralist state, peaceful artistic acts – even if they can be seen as provocative – must not lead to the accusation of serious criminal acts that lead to lengthy prison terms.\\"Henry Meyer (8 August 2012), Madonna Urges Freedom for Anti-Putin Punk Girls at Concert Bloomberg News.Appell aus dem Bundestag: Deutsche Abgeordnete fordern Milde für Pussy Riot Spiegel Online, 7 August 2012.

Biestek was born in Cicero, Illinois and graduated from Loyola University of Chicago in 1938. He was ordained in 1945. He earned a master's degree in sociology at St. Louis University and a master's degree (1949) and doctorate in social work (1951) at Catholic University of America in Washington D. C.

Modern Social Work in Search of a Soul: Felix Biestek, in the Service of Others. San Francisco: International Scholars Publications, 1997. WorldCat  Biestek's Principles of Social Casework  Individualization: The recognition of each client as a unique individual. It is based on the need and the right of each human being to be treated as an individual and not just as a typical member of a category or group. Purposeful expression of feeling: The recognition of the client's need to express his feelings freely, especially his negative feelings. The worker listens purposefully, neither discouraging nor condemning the expression of these feelings. To deny a client the opportunity to express his feelings, his fears, his hopes, his hostility, etc. is a refusal to deal with the total person. In social work, it is believed that every problem or request for help has an emotional component, and that the client has a need and right to express it. Controlled emotional involvement: The worker's sensitivity to the client's feelings, an understanding of the meaning of these feelings, and a purposeful, appropriate response. The worker's response is not only verbal; it is also nonverbal. The worker becomes “involved” emotionally by sensing and responding to feelings. The involvement is “controlled” by the self-discipline of the worker, the purpose of the case, and other factors. This principle is one of the key principles in social work Acceptance: The worker perceives and deals with the client as he really is, including his strengths and weaknesses, his positive and negative feelings, his constructive and destructive attitudes and behaviour, while maintaining and communicating a sense of the client's innate dignity and personal worth. Acceptance does not mean approval. The object of acceptance is not “the good”, but “the real”. The acceptance, which the client perceives, permits him to reveal himself fully, without damage to his sense of dignity. Nonjudgmental attitude: The non-judgmental attitude is based on the belief that social work does not include assigning guilt or innocence. If the client fears blame and judgment, he will not talk about himself. Not only blame, but also praise and approval, are examples of a judgmental attitude. Blame and praise may have the same effect on a client: to hide a part of himself so as not to be judged. Client self-determination: The recognition of the right and the need of the client to have freedom in making his own choices and decisions in the social work process. The worker does not take responsibility for the client, does not persuade in a controlling way, and does not manipulate the client to make decisions to conform to the worker's preferences. (The client's right to self-determination may be limited by the client's capacity for decision-making, by civil and moral law, and by the function of the agency). Confidentiality: Confidentiality is the preservation of private information concerning the client, which is disclosed within the professional relationship, or is received from other sources in the course of working with a client. (The client's right to confidentiality is not absolute. There are situations in which another right or duty is greater than the client's right to confidentiality).  Critiques  It has also been critiques on these principles being capitalistic in nature, Euro-centric, and focused too heavily on Christian values. Academics have questions on its applicability to non-European communities and other culturally rich nations and traditions.

Biography Bertram was born in Gascony, and became a jurist in the University of Toulouse and papal chaplain. On 4 June 1334 he was appointed as patriarch of Aquileia, which was not only a simple diocese but a powerful state occupying what is now is Friuli. Bertram proved a skilled diplomat and military leader. He allied with the Republic of Venice and the Duchy of Austria. In 1335 he defeated Rizzardo da Camino, who had invaded the patriarchate during the vacancy period; by this victory he was able to recover also the Cadore (1347). Later he sided with Louis I of Hungary in his expedition to Zadar (May–June 1346), which had been caught by the Venetians. Later, allied with the counts of Gorizia, Albert IV of Istria, Albert II of Austria and the Croats, he invaded Istria (1348). Koper rebelled to the Venetians, but the latter intervened and forced Bertram to a peace which brought him no gains. Subsequently, Bertram attacked the count of Gorizia, personally leading an army to reconquer Venzone (1336), Braulins and Cormons. The Gorizians reacted and invaded the patriarchal lands, but Bertram besieged Gorizia and forced the count to a definitive truce in 1341. Once restored the foreign situation, he devoted himself to suppress the power and the autonomies gained by the Friulian feudal lords. He also strengthened the Alpine passes, building a castle (Rocca Bertranda) between Moggio Udinese and Pontebba, and had a new line of walls built in Sacile (1347). From the religious point of view, he held two councils in Udine (1335) and Aquileia (1339), followed by four synods in which he reformed the Patriarchate's religious life and established norms against the heresies which had spread in its lands. Bertram was also a patron of the arts: he established the university of Cividale in 1344 and restored the Udine Cathedral. He also introduced new coins. The Friulian nobles, discontented by Bertram's policies, formed an alliance against him at Spilimbergo in 1348, and conquered several villages; Udine, which had been deprived of water, was forced to accept a truce while a papal legate attempted to find a diplomatic solution. Once any possibility of a military victory waned, the rebels set a plot against the aged patriarch, who was assassinated by Enrico da Spilimbergo at San Giorgio della Richinvelda on 6 June 1350.

It's located between Recife and Olinda, and it occupies 57.000 m² of land. Mirabilandia operates three traveling parks in Brazil, called Universal Park, Fiesta Park and American Park. History Mirabilandia is an amusement park located in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. Opened in 2002, it's now one of the most successful amusement parks in Brazil. Resulting from a partnership between the group peixoto and an Italian group, it had 15 rides and 1 coaster at opening, but today features more than 30 attractions, and is the Brazilian park which made the largest investment by buying new attractions. The Mirabilandia of Pernambuco is the only fixed amusement park in the entire Northeast of Brazil. The park features 35 attractions in categories frightening, radical, and family. Justin Bieber and Altaf Hussain met here in 2012. It also has a medical clinic, coat check, sanitary sector, lost and found, a lounge with games and a stage for shows, plays, and musicals. The park also has special programs, such as the educational project \\"Lessons in the Park\\" which takes children and young people from public schools and private lessons for multidisciplinary education using the park as scenery and attractions as learning tools. In addition, the park has several themes such as \\"Fazendinha Mirabilandia\\", \\"The Gardens\\", and \\"Rio das Pedras\\" which has the objective of raising ecological and nature awareness. As of 2012, the park is being expanded due to high demand. Hora do Terror - Time of Terror Every month from October to December are the presentations of \\"Time of Terror\\" a terrifying event with an opening that starts at 18:00 and at the end of the show featured actors of monsters walk in the park frightening everyone to come forward.

He was the founder and managing editor of Deus Ex Malcontent, a blog which rose to prominence after Pazienza was fired from his job as a senior producer at CNN in 2008, as well as the CEO of DXM Media.http://www.thedailybanter.com The Daily Banter Early life Pazienza was born and raised in Miami, Florida, the only child of Mickie and Ralph Pazienza. Throughout most of his childhood his mother was a real estate agent, while his father was an officer with the North Bay Village Police Department and eventually an investigative reporter for Miami's WSVN TV. Education Pazienza attended elementary school at Atlantic Christian School in Hialeah, Florida, was enrolled for the 8th grade at Dade Christian School, a strict Baptist academy, and ultimately attended high school at Monsignor Edward Pace High School in the Miami suburb of Opa- locka, Florida. He graduated in 1987 and was voted Most Talented in the Arts among his senior class. Immediately after high school, Pazienza enrolled at the University of Miami, double-majoring in motion pictures and psychology. He joined the staff of WVUM, the school's radio station, becoming both a DJ and a specialty show host. In 1990, after becoming a drummer in an alternative rock band and deciding that he hoped to make a living playing music, Pazienza left the university, a year short of graduating. Career Pazienza began a career in television news in 1992 as a writer/producer at WSVN TV. After rising quickly through the ranks to the position of executive producer he left, moving to Los Angeles to accept a job as a senior producer at KCBS-TV. While there he received his first regional Emmy Award, in 1996, and won a prestigious Golden Mic Award. He went on to work as a producer at KNBC in Los Angeles, where he was given his second regional Emmy, and an executive producer at KCAL-TV in Los Angeles. During his time in television he also served as a producer and manager at WTVJ NBC 6 and WPLG 10 in Miami, and at MSNBC in New York City following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. His TV career culminated with a senior producer position at CNN, first in Atlanta, Georgia then in New York City. Fired by CNN On February 12, 2008, Pazienza was fired by CNN for maintaining a personal blog, called Deus Ex Malcontent, which was started in the summer of 2006, as well as contributing opinion pieces to The Huffington Post. The firing garnered a small amount of media attention and amplified the debate over whether it is acceptable for a journalist to publicly express his or her personal views on personal time; it also drew attention to the new ethical issues suddenly facing mainstream news organization in the age of social media. Pazienza capitalized on the attention, writing a scathing column for The Huffington Post detailing some of his experiences at CNN, specifically what he felt was a dereliction of duty by the network and mainstream news outlets in general when it came to covering serious news. Since then he continued writing about subjects involving the media; he regularly mined his personal experiences as a television news producer to offer opinionated commentary on topics including NBC's role in the late-night war between Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno, and CNN's decision to fire Rick Sanchez, whom Pazienza worked closely with at several points throughout his career. Dead Star Twilight In the wake of the attention thrust on it following his firing, Pazienza made the decision to use his website to exclusively publish his memoir, Dead Star Twilight; discussing his experiences in the time leading up to and immediately following 9/11, which included a drug addiction, stint in rehab, divorce and ultimately an attempt at personal and professional redemption while working at MSNBC and living in New York City. He published it online on April 7, 2008. Death On February 26, 2017, Pazienza's employer, The Daily Banter, announced the news of his death.

Arab-Berbers ( Ālʿrb Wālbrbr) are an ethnolinguistic group of the Maghreb, a vast region of North Africa in the western part of the Arab world along the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Arab-Berbers are people of mixed Arab and Berber origin, most of whom speak a variant of Maghrebi Arabic as their native language, although about 16 to 25 million speak various Berber languages. Many Arab-Berbers identify primarily as Arab and secondarily as Berber. While some Arab-Berbers claim West Asian descent, genetic studies there have determined that Arab and non- Arab Berbers are genetically nearly identical. This suggests that the processes of \\"Arabization\\" in the Maghreb was probably mainly cultural rather than genetic.Bosch, Elena et al. \\"Genetic structure of north-west Africa revealed by STR analysis.\\" European Journal of Human Genetics (2000) 8, 360–366. Pg. 365 The Arab-Berber identity came into being as a direct result of the Arab conquest of North Africa, and the intermarriage between the Arabian and Persian people who immigrated to those regions and local mainly Roman Africans and other Berber people; in addition, Banu Hilal and Sulaym Arab tribes originating in the Arabian Peninsula invaded the region and intermarried with the local rural mainly Berber populations, and were a major factor in the linguistic, cultural and ethnic Arabization of the Maghreb.Weiss, Bernard G. and Green, Arnold H.(1987) A Survey of Arab History American University in Cairo Press, Cairo, p. 129, Ballais, Jean-Louis (2000) \\"Chapter 7: Conquests and land degradation in the eastern Maghreb\\" p. 133 Arabized Berbers form the core and vast majority of the native populations of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, and about one-third of the population of Mauritania.Bekada A, Fregel R, Cabrera VM, Larruga JM, Pestano J, et al.

Moreover, they also have many loanwords from French,Zribi, I., Boujelbane, R., Masmoudi, A., Ellouze, M., Belguith, L., & Habash, N. (2014). A Conventional Orthography for Tunisian Arabic. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), Reykjavik, Iceland. Turkish, Italian and the languages of Spain. Modern Standard Arabic is used as the lingua franca. Historical perspective Medieval Arabic sources refers to Northwest Africa as Ifriqiya, Mauretania or as Bilad Al Barbar (; ). This designation may have given rise to the term Barbary Coast which was used by Europeans until the 19th century to refer to coastal Northwest Africa. Since the populations were partially affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture, Northwest Africa also started to be referred to by the Arabic speakers as Al-Maġrib, the Maghreb (meaning \\"The West\\") as it was considered as the western part of the known world. For historical references, medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers used to refer to Morocco as Al-Maghrib al Aqşá (\\"The Farthest West\\"), disambiguating it from neighboring historical regions called Al-Maghrib al Awsat (\\"The Middle West\\", Algeria) and Al-Maghrib al Adna (\\"The Nearest West\\", Ifriqiya (Tunisia)). The Maghreb was gradually arabized with the spread of Islam in the 7th century AD, when the liturgical language Arabic was first brought to the Maghreb. However, the bulk of the population of northwestern Africa remained Berber or Roman Africans at least until the 14th century. Arabization was at least partly strengthened in the rural areas in the 11th century with the emigration of the Banu Hilal tribes from Egypt. However, many parts of the Maghreb were only arabized relatively recently in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the area of the Aurès (Awras) mountains. Lastly, the mass education and promotion of Arabic language and culture through schools and mass media, during the 20th century, by the maghrebis governments, is regarded as the strongest contributor to the Arabization process in the Maghreb. Population genetics Various population genetics studies along with historians such as Gabriel Camps and Charles-André Julien lend support to the idea that the bulk of the gene pool of modern Maghrebis, irrespective of linguistic group, is derived from the Berber populations of the pre-Islamic period.Arredi et al.

Historical Honiton lace designs focused on scrollwork and depictions of natural objects such as flowers and leaves. This wedding dress from 1865 is trimmed with Honiton lace. Characteristics Honiton lace is a part lace. Its ornate sprigs or motifs, complex patterns were created separately and then sewn into the net ground of the piece. Common sprigs include daisies, roses, shamrocks, ivy leaves, butterflies, lilies, camellias, convolvulus, poppies, briony, antwerp diamonds, trefoils, ferns, and acorns. Origin and history The art of making lace is rumored to have been brought to Honiton, England by Flemish refugees in the mid-to-late 16th century. An old tombstone in the town is inscribed with information about one James Rodge who is described as a “bone lace seller” who died in 1617; it is not known whether he emigrated from Flanders or not. In the early period (approx. 1620-1800), sprigs of various designs were worked separately from the net ground by hand, then put together near the end of production. Later (approx. 1800-1840), handmade Honiton lace became obsolete in light of the invention of machine-made net, which was much cheaper to produce. Historian Emily Jackson describes the design changes fostered by the convenience of this approach: > “There was a curious wave of careless designing and inartistic method during > the time of this depression, and ugly patterns show ‘turkey tails,’ ‘frying > pans,’ and hearts. Not a leaf, nor a flower, was copied from nature.” Handmade lacework had a resurgence in popularity in the 19th century when Queen Victoria ordered a Honiton lace bridal dress. The revival happened so quickly, and demand was so great, that a cheaper-quality lace was produced in large quantities. Due to the massive demand, this cheaper work had simpler designs due to the necessary speed of production. Defining designs of lace at this time were “leaves, flowers, [and] scrolls . . . [that] look as natural as possible.” 19th century Honiton lace incorporates a variety of stitches, including: whole stitch, stem stitch, lace stitch, fibre stitch, long plaitings, square plaitings, broad/cucumber plaitings, Honiton ground, star ground, Dame Joan ground, buckle stitch, Flemish stitch, turn-stitch, chequer stitch, fibre stitch, and Antwerp diamond stitch.

In college, he played on the defensive line for the University of Illinois. In his professional career, he was a member of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League, the Jacksonville Sharks and San Antonio Talons of the Arena Football League and the Indianapolis Colts and Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League. He was signed as a free agent by the Jacksonville Sharks in 2011 and was a contributor to the Sharks victory in ArenaBowl XXIV by having one tackle assist, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Early years Brown played football at Vashon High School, helping his team win three St. Louis Public High League titles and three Missouri district championships. His best year came as a senior in 2005, recording 97 tackles, 13 sacks and one interception. During his high school career, he was a two- time Public High League Defensive MVP and a first-team All-Public High League Conference selection. As a senior, he received PrepStar All-America honors, was named to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch first-team All-Metro squad and was a Missouri Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association Class 5 first-team all- state choice. He was the 11th-ranked high school recruit in Missouri and 53rd- ranked defensive end in the nation according to Rivals.com. College career In 2006, Brown accepted a football scholarship to the University of Illinois. He was redshirted as a freshman and by the end of the season he would go on to be named the team's defensive scout player of the year. As a sophomore, he played in 13 games and had 2.5 sacks during Illinois' run to the 2008 Rose Bowl. As a junior in 2008, he saw action in 11 games, recording 3 tackles (1 for loss) against the University of Missouri. As a senior in 2009, he had an outstanding spring game making a game-high seven tackles and two sacks, but academic problems eventually forced him to leave school. During his college career, he played mostly as backup defensive end, recording a total of 13 tackles (4 for loss), 2.5 sacks and two passes defensed. Professional career=Jacksonville Sharks (AFL) After not being selected in the 2011 NFL Draft, he signed with the Jacksonville Sharks of the Arena Football League (AFL) on March 3, 2011, helping the team win ArenaBowl XXIV. In the final, he posted one tackle, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. In 13 regular season games he recorded 19.5 tackles, six sacks and three fumble recoveries. Hamilton Tiger-Cats (CFL) At the end of the AFL season, he was signed to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats practice roster on September 27, 2011. San Antonio Talons (AFL) Brown signed with the San Antonio Talons of the AFL on November 11, 2011. He played in 11 games recording 34 tackles (5 for loss), two fumble recoveries and one blocked kick. Indianapolis Colts (NFL) He worked out for the Houston Texans, New York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles, before being signed as a free agent by the Indianapolis Colts on May 23, 2012 to play linebacker. He was one of the last cuts in preseason before making the team's practice squad. He appeared in one regular season game against the New York Jets, before being waived and signed once again to the practice squad. He was cut from the team on October 20, 2012. Dallas Cowboys (NFL) On October 24, 2012, the Dallas Cowboys signed him to their practice squad, where he was making progress by being named scout team player of the week and receiving consideration for a move to the active roster, until losing his life in a car accident. Death On December 8, 2012, at 2:21 am, fellow Cowboys and Illinois teammate Josh Brent drove a car at high speeds with Brown in it. The car hit an outside curb on Texas State Highway 114 outside Dallas, causing the vehicle to flip at least once and then come to rest in the middle of a service road. The car caught fire, which was extinguished. Brown was unresponsive at the scene and later pronounced dead. Brent was charged with driving under the influence and intoxication manslaughter. Police stated that Brent attempted to pull Brown out of the car. This tragedy occurred one day before playing against the Cincinnati Bengals, which was a game with playoff implications for both sides and that the Bengals were heavily favored to win. Head coach Jason Garrett told the team of the incident and its tragic result on the plane, before flying to Cincinnati. That Saturday, the players held emotional meetings and hung the jerseys of Brent and Brown in their locker room. The game would become one of the most emotional in franchise history. The defense was already going to play without 5 starters (Bruce Carter, Sean Lee, Barry Church, Kenyon Coleman and Jay Ratliff) and they would also end up losing Brent, who was going to start in place of Ratliff. The Cowboys stunned the Bengals with an improbable 20–19 come-from-behind victory that was decided in the closing seconds with a Dan Bailey 40-yard field goal. After the final play, Garrett embraced Jason Hatcher, who held Brown's jersey, which was originally placed on the bench during the game. In Brown's honor, the Cowboys wore a 53 decal on their uniforms, and kept his locker intact. For the memorial service, Stacey Jackson (Brown's mother) requested Brent to meet with the family at the airport, to also ride and sit with them while at the event. The team presented Jackson with the game ball of the 20–19 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, along with a hard-hat award, which was given to players who did their job regardless of circumstance.

In 1685 he was elected bishop of Macerata and Tolentino, April 9, 1685, and later was appointed Nuncio in Cologne in 1696. Pope Innocent XII elevated him to the rank of cardinal in the consistory of 19 December 1698, and he became archbishop of Ferrara. He became Cardinal Secretary of State during the pontificate of Pope Clement XI. On Clement's death, at the succeeding conclave of 1721, Paolucci was the strongest candidate to succeed, but was vetoed by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor as he considered him too close to the French. Instead Michelangelo Conti was elected as Pope Innocent XIII. After the latter's death in 1724 Paolucci was again one of the leading candidates for the papacy, but again the imperial veto played its part. However, with the election of Pope Benedict XIII, he resumed the role of Secretary of State and held the position until his death. It was Paolucci who ordered the construction of the neoclassical Palazzo Paolucci de Calboli at Forlì. He died on 12 June 1726 at the age of 75 years.

History The journal was established in 1910 as the Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology by Dean John Henry Wigmore. From 1931 to 1951 it was named Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology and from 1951 to 1972 The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science. It received its current name in 1973. The Journal was an outgrowth of the \\"National Conference on Criminal Law and Criminology,\\" hosted at Northwestern University School of Law in 1909 in celebration of the law school's fiftieth anniversary. Consistent with the progressive agenda in the early twentieth century, the purpose of the Journal was to articulate and promote criminal justice reform. JCLC has a unique interdisciplinary approach, and remains today the only journal in the world that combines both criminal law and criminology. This contributes to the success and reach of the Journal: JCLC is one of the most widely-read and frequently-cited publications in the world.

Life Dede Reshat was born on 4 March 1935 in village of Lusën, in the region of the northern Albanian town of Kukës. In 1944, as the destruction of war raged around him, Dede Reshat moved to Tirana with his family. It was there that he received both his secular as well as Islamic religion education. When he was 14 years old, Dede Reshat visited the Mother Tekke of the Bektashi Sufi Order (asitâne-i madhe) and from that time took up residence there. Four years later, at the age of eighteen, he was initiated as a dervish, and served as rehber in the ceremonies that took place on the sacred premises of the Mother Tekke. Between 1957 and 1967, Dede Reshat was placed under house arrest by the communist government along with Dedebaba Ahmed Myftar in a small tekke near Drizar, Mallakastra. In the ten years of exile, this tekke served as the unofficial Mother Tekke of the Bektashi community. Believers would come here illegally from all over Albania and Yugoslavia. With the closure of all houses of worship and the prohibition of religion by the communists in 1967 (which lasted until 1990), Dede Reshat was forcibly assigned work on a state-run farm, where he was continually harassed, both psychologically and physically, by state security officers. Meanwhile, his residence in Tirana was turned into an illegal center for keeping Bektashism alive. Along with a group of devout Bektashi believers Dede Reshat reopened the Mother Tekke of the Bektashi Sufi Order on March 22, 1991, the day of the festival of Sultan Nevruz. During the communist period, the building had been used as state-run home for the elderly. In November 1991, Dede Reshat made the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca together with the first Albanian pilgrims to go in a generation. There he was received by senior Saudi religious authorities and having made the pilgrimage took the title al-Hajj (or Haxhi). In February 1992 Dede Reshat travelled to the USA to visit the Bektashi community of Detroit, where he was received by Baba Rexheb and senior clerics of other faiths. Baba Rexheb was responsible for establishing the first Bektashi Tekke in America in 1954 and for keeping Bektashism alive during the dark days of communism. In May 1993 Dede Reshat was received by the late head of Turkey's Bektashi community Bedri Noyan Dede, who organized meetings with senior Bektashi religious leaders in Istanbul and Izmir. The 6th World Bektashi Congress that was held in 1993 unanimously elected Dede Reshat to the head the Mother Tekke of the Bektashi Sufi Order, and thus he was given the title Dedebaba. In August of that same year Dede Reshat visited the tekke/museum of Haji Bektash Veli in Turkey, where thousands of believers from the Asian parts of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkestan, and the Middle East came to greet him. The mayor of the town of Hacıbektaş received Dede Reshat with a special lunch of honor. On every religious holiday from 1991 and until his death Dede Reshat received Albanian’s presidents, prime ministers, speakers of the parliament, as well as ministers and ambassadors of foreign states. In 1994 and 1995 Dede Reshat visited the Islamic Republic of Iran, where he was received by the highest leader of the Ahl al-Bayt Foundation, Mr. Mir Hosseini and senior religious leaders from Iran, India and Kuwait. In March 2001 Dede Reshat was invited to a special audience with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican, where both men discussed their resistance to communism. In August 2002, Dede Reshat again travelled to Haji Bektashi in Turkey, where he met with the then Prime Minister of Turkey, Bulent Ecevit, who congratulated him on his role in preserving the Bektash way. In October 2002 Dede Reshat took part in the International Conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which was held in Azerbaijan. Dede Reshat spoke on behalf of Bektashis worldwide. One year later he was invited to the Vatican to take part in the canonisation ceremony for Mother Teresa, along with other religious leaders from around the world. Dede Reshat was again by Pope John Paul II and other high Catholic religious authorities. In February 2004 Dede Reshat also took part in the World Conference for Peace and Tolerance which was organized by Partiarkati Ekumenal and the Apel Ndërgjegjes Foundation. His words on their work received a standing ovation. In April 2004 Dede Reshat took part in a symposium held in Germany on Alevis and Bektashis in Germany. There he greeted participants on behalf of the Bektashi community. On the occasion of the 7th World Bektashi Congress that was held in October 2005 in Tirana, Dede Reshat hosted the Minister of Culture and Tourism of Turkey, Atilla Koç, as well as the mayors of the Turkish towns of Nevşehir andHacıbektaş. In December 2005 Dede Reshat was welcomed in Prishtina at thecongress of the Albanian World League. He was received by Kosovo’s Minister of Culture, Mr. Astrit Haraçia. In May 2006 Dede Reshat received the President of the Governorate of Vatican City State, Cardinal Giovanni Lajolo, at the Mother Tekke in Tirana. Among other things the Cardinal said, “Your excellency is the Bektashi Pope!” In June 2006 Dede Reshat hosted Turkey's Parliament Speaker, Mr. Bülent Arınç at the Mother Tekke in Tirana. He presented Dede Reshat with a plaque from the Turkish Parliament honoring his outstanding service in spreading peace and goodwill.

He ascended to the throne after his predecessor and uncle, Mohammad Yayyo,. As a loyal suzerain of Emperor Haile Selassie I, Alimirah possessed only moderate governing authority as Sultan, but was highly influential as a landowner and as the senior spiritual and cultural leader of the Afar people. Under his rule, significant progress was made towards modernising agriculture amongst the pastoral Afar; attracting foreign investment, organising access to credit, and promoting infrastructural development. After the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy by the Derg, Sultan Alimirah was targeted by the new socialist regime for his influence, status as a landowner, and support for the deposed emperor. In 1971 (according to the Ethiopian calendar) the Sultan was forced to flee the country when the Derg attempted to capture him in a bloody raid on Asaita, and proceeded to establish the Afar Liberation Front to resist the government and defend the Afar's rights to their land. Upon the Derg's overthrow in 1991 the Sultan returned to Ethiopia, where he initially supported the efforts of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front led by Meles Zenawi. Relations quickly soured, however, over the issue of Afars in Eritrea, whom the Sultan wanted to remain part of an autonomous Afar region within Ethiopia. This, amongst other disputes, led to the Sultan's marginalisation from the politics of the new Afar Region. Sultan Alimirah died on 24 April 2011 and was succeeded by his son Hanfare Alimirah.https://dnlafar.blogspot.com/2020/09/life-story-of-sultan-hanfare- alimirah.html Alimirah was not only considered a leader of the Afar people, but was admired by many Ethiopians for his patriotism, resistance to the Derg, and support for Ethiopian unity. Early life Alimirah Hanfere was born in area the village of Fursi, which is today divided between the Amhara Region and the Afar Region. He was said to have been born around 1919, but at his death was said to be 95 years old, suggesting he was born earlier. A member of the Aussa Mudaito Dynasty, and the youngest of three children, with two older sisters, Fatima and Medina, his father was Hanfare Aydahis and mother was Hawy Omar. His grandfather, Mahammad ibn Hanfere, was himself Sultan of Aussa from 1862 to 1902, who declared his loyalty to Emperor Menelik II and defeated an Egyptian force led by Werner Munzinger attempting to invade Ethiopia in 1875.Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People, second edition (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 90. . His father was killed while his mother was pregnant with Alimirah, and she herself died when Alimirah was young, leaving him to be raised by his eldest sister, Fatima. Fatima married Fitawrari Yayyo Hamadu, an important leader of the Aussa, second only to the Sultan, Mohammad Yayyo. Yayyo Hamadu was entrusted with the transport of goods between the port of Assab and the capital Addis Ababa by camel caravans, making him wealthy and also facilitating a close friendship with Ras Tafari Makonnen, the future Haile Selassie I. When Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Sultan Muhammad agreed to not resist the Italians in exchange for being allowed their autonomy. When the Aussas made a visit to Rome in 1939, Yayyo and Alimirah, his son-in-law, visited the imprisoned Leul Ras Imru Haile Selassie, whom they helped financially and pleaded (unsuccessfully) to be released. Upon Ethiopia's liberation in 1941, Yayyo and Alimirah captured nearly a thousand Italian soldiers and brought them to Addis Ababa to commemorate the Emperor's return. Rise to power While the actions of Yayyo and Alimirah strengthened their friendship with Haile Selassie, it was against the wishes of Sultan Mohammed, who sought to follow by the terms of his agreement with the Italians and leave their troops alone. Furthermore, Sultan Mohammed sought to place the Aussa Sultanate under British administration in the manner of Eritrea and the Ogaden. This was greatly opposed by many Aussa and Yayyo, who said \\"Our emperor is back, the white people were defeated,\\" causing a major rift between the two; Sultan Mohammed dismissed Yayyo in 1942. One day sometime in 1944, Yayyo was called to join the Sultan after prayers. Concluding this was a ruse to have him killed, Yayyo instead fled to Addis Ababa after expressing his thoughts to Emperor Haile Selassie. While both agreeing that the Sultan should be removed, Yayyo felt that he would not be accepted by the Afars as Sultan, as he did not come from the senior Aydahisso branch of the Mudaito dynasty. Instead, he proposed that Alimirah, who did come from the Aydahisso clan, become Sultan. Six months after this incident, the plot was set into action. Alimirah was made a Dejazmach, and Yayyo restored to his title of Fitawrari, and several thousand soldiers of the Kebur Zabagna (Imperial Guard) were placed under their control. The force led by Yayyo and Alimirah set out to Asaita to oust the Sultan, taking a fortnight to travel. To keep their advance a secret, they detained any Afar person they saw travelling on the way, placing them in one of several empty trucks provided for that purpose, and arranged for the prohibition of any travel past the town of Bati, a key trading post to the Afar regions. Upon eventually being warned of the force's advance when they were only a day away, Sultan Mohammed dismissed them and even chastised his son for attempting to rally the palace guard in defense, convinced that such an attempt was impossible. Thus, when the force arrived in Asaita the following day, it faced virtually no resistance, with only one guard on duty. Sultan Mohammed was deposed, and, after being assured his family members would not be killed (as was typical in Afar power struggles), was sent to Addis Ababa, where he died of natural causes some time later. Reign as sultan Assuming the throne at only 22 years old, Sultan Alimirah was heavily influenced by Fitawrari Yayyo, but over time was able to a centralise power in himself, often to the detriment of the lesser chiefs that traditionally exercised significant power. His authority was also compromised by the provincial authorities and imperial government who asserted their control over the lands of the Sultanate, often a matter of bitter contention between the Sultan and the central government. Despite this, the relationship between the Sultan and Haile Selassie was a loyal one. Development efforts Much like the imperial government and Haile Selassie on a national scale, Sultan Alimirah worked to improve the agricultural situation in Aussa, which accounted for the livelihoods of the vast majority of the Afar people. He facilitated the establishment of several large commercial farms in Aussa, primarily producing cotton, as well as other crops. Thus many formerly pastoral Afars began to settle in towns to work on the new cotton farms. While the Sultan owned many of these new large commercial farms, he arranged for the Addis Ababa Bank (later nationalised and today part of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia) to open a branch in Asaita to stimulate the expansion of the agricultural sector, and founded the Aussa Farmers Association to make it easier for Afar farmers to take out loans co-operatively. In the 1960s, a joint venture between the British firm Mitchell Cotts and the Ethiopian government was created to produce cotton in the region, under the Sultan's supervision. In contrast to the government's state farms, the scheme worked to cooperate with the local people and create large farms whilst respecting traditional customs of collective ownership. By the time of the Sultan's flight in 1975, it was noted that there were 600 tractors, 80 bulldozers and 30 Cessna planes in the Aussa awrajja, a large amount relative to the rest of the country. The Sultan also opened several health clinics schools in Aussa, including a boarding school and madrassah for all Afars in Asaita. He opposed the consumption of khat, organised Islamic leaders, reformed religious practices, and proclaimed rights for women. Indeed, some came to refer to Aussa as \\"Kuwait\\" due to its relative wealth. In 1972 the Sultan visited the United States at the invitation of USAID, where he visited 15 states and met with African-American leaders such as Jesse Jackson and Elijah Muhammad. He was impressed by the warm reception accorded, especially after giving a speech in Chicago praising the leadership of Haile Selassie and receiving a standing ovation. Following this trip, it was arranged for several Afar students to study in the United States. Disputes and efforts for autonomy Sultan Alimirah often came into conflict with the central government over its encroachment on the authority of the Sultanate. Aussa, which had been more-or- less self-governing until the Sultan's ascension in 1944, had been greatly weakened in power by the centralising forces of Haile Selassie's government. In 1950 he withdrew from Asaita for two years in opposition, returning only two after following mediation by Fitawrari Yayyo. The Sultan sought to unite the Afar people under an autonomous Sultanate, while remaining part of Ethiopia; they had been divided amongst the provinces of Hararghe, Shewa, Tigray, and Wollo. In 1961, when it was clear the Eritrean federal arrangement was headed towards its demise, 55 Afar chieftains in Eritrea met and endorsed the idea of an Ethiopian Afar autonomy. Following the dissolution of Eritrea's federal government and its transformation into a centrally-administered province, Afar leaders met again in Assab in 1963 and supported the creation of an autonomous region. In 1964 Afar leaders went to Addis Ababa to present Haile Selassie with their proposal, but the effort came up empty-handed. In the early 1970s the Ethiopian government established a \\"Awash Valley Authority\\" to advance the development of the Awash River basin through introducing large-scale commercial farms. While intended to the help the region's development, the scheme would have displaced thousands of rural Afars from their ancestral land and separated them from the river on which they depended for their livelihood and very survival. After strenuous objections from Sultan Alimirah on their behalf, the scheme was abandoned- although it is thought protecting his own large plantations also played a role. Despite these encroachments and conflicts, the Sultan remained fundamentally loyal to the Emperor and Ethiopia; in turn, while he did not achieve the autonomous sultanate he desired, he enjoyed an appreciable level of autonomy in the areas of the Sultanate, almost unique amongst the many petty kingdoms incorporated into the Ethiopian state in the late 19th century. For example, while the government appointed a governor to the awrajja (district) of Aussa proper, the governor, rather than taking up residence in the capital of Asaita, instead sat in Bati, which was outside the district entirely. The Sultan enjoyed a warm relationship with Haile Selassie, and was eventually granted the title of Bitwoded, the second highest title attainable by a non-member of the royal family. Assessing his relationship with the emperor, Alimirah recalled that \\"[Haile Selassie] looked at us peripheral rulers with respect. We had good relations with him. He never interfered directly in our internal affairs. I had direct access to his palace or his office.\\" Death and burial Sultan Alimirah died on April 24, 2011 in Addis Ababa, at approximately the age of 95. He was buried in the northeastern town of Asaita, the former capital of the Afar Region. Legacy and assessment Amongst Afars, Alimirah is revered as a \\"beloved spiritual father, leader, and caretaker\\" who was dedicated to the progress and unity of his people. In his efforts to advance the Afar economy, he is thought to have balanced the benefits of agricultural modernisation with respect for tradition and traditional land ownership. As a leader, he is thought to have been just and morally upright, leading one commentator to say that \\"Under the rule of Sultan Alimirah no one walks away without justice. The legacy he built was support to the needy, justice to the poor, and share the resources of the community for [the] common well-being of the people.\\" While not granted much power in the new government, the actions of the Afar Liberation Front during the transition period and the early years of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia demonstrated the Sultan's sincerity; it worked to establish democratic institutions, health and educational facilities and other economic and social institutions amongst the Afar. Most Afars his consistency in promoting the unity of the Afar people. First through his efforts to advance Afar unity and protect Afar interests during the reign of Haile Selassie, followed by armed resistance against the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam in defense of the Afar and their land and custom, and in turn followed by his attempts to preserve Afar unity across Ethiopia and Eritrea made him a near-legendary figure. Therefore, he was regarded as the spiritual and cultural leader of all Afars at the time of his death, and not just those traditionally under the rule of the Aussa Sultanate. The Sultan is also widely admired by non-Afar Ethiopians, particularly those amongst the opposition expressing an Ethiopian nationalist viewpoint, for his patriotism, loyalty, and dedication to Ethiopia's unity. Despite seeking to unite the Afar people under his leadership, and despite the slights committed by the imperial state and the atrocities of the communist dictatorship against the Afar, he did not seek independence and instead committed the Aussa Sultanate and the Afar people to Ethiopia, stridently condemning those who sought an independent Afar state, saying, \\"We are one with all Ethiopians. No one can make excuses and take this identity from the Afar people. Only the forces who are anti-Afar people will make claims of separation. We will not hesitate to expose them for what they are. This must be done for the unity of our Ethiopian people.\\" He was also deeply loyal to Emperor Haile Selassie, even going as far to once say that \\"Haile Selassie is not the leader for Ethiopia only, but he is the leader for all black people in the world, wherever they might be.\\" When touring the United States in 1972, he delivered several speeches praising the emperor's leadership, and inquired after the well-being of the Ethiopians living in the cities he visited. He was recognised for his resistance to the Fascist occupiers and his attempts to look after the well-being of other Ethiopians such as Le'ul Ras Imru Haile Selassie who had been imprisoned by them. He gave generously to charitable institutions throughout Ethiopia; for example he gave 10,000 birr, at that time a large sum (adjusted for inflation, around 640,000 birr in today's prices), to a local Addis Ababa edir (traditional co-operative funerary association) operating in the neighbourhood of his house in the city. When Prime Minister Meles Zenawi remarked that the flag of Ethiopia was \\"just a common rag\\", the Sultan was said to have retorted that \\"even our camels salute the Ethiopian flag\\". For these reasons, Alimirah Hanfare is considered to be a heroic patriot by many Ethiopians. Furthermore, the Sultan is particularly admired by nationalist opponents of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front for his opposition to Eritrean independence and for his desire to incorporate Afar regions of Eritrea into Ethiopia as part of the Afar Region. When representatives of the opposition movements that had worked to overthrow the government of Mengistu Haile Mariam met in July 1991, the Sultan discovered that the delegates of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front had elected not to participate as representatives but merely observers. Upon learning this was because they sought to separate from Ethiopia, the Sultan attacked them, saying that \\"in my opinion this conference was not to dismember Ethiopia but to unite Ethiopia. A conference that discusses how to achieve equality, justice, democracy and good governance for all Ethiopians. The Ethiopian people expect us to come out of this conference with a new government and democracy, not two different nations.\\" His desire to unite Afars as part of Ethiopia also garnered the respect of nationalists, particularly because such an effort, if successful, would have preserved Ethiopian control over a significant stretch of sea-coast, and port of Assab, therefore preventing the country from becoming the most populous landlocked country in the world, an outcome the Sultan also explicitly opposed. To these people, Sultan Alimirah is to be considered more patriotic and dedicated to Ethiopian unity than the Ethiopian government itself. However, the Sultan was not without his critics. He was considered to be an illegitimate usurper, placed into power by Ethiopian intervention and intrigue. He was attacked by the Derg and leftist Afars as a feudalist landowner who was willing to sell out the Afar people for his own self interests. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front levelled similar criticisms, opposing its conservative ideology, the ALF's apparently lavish expenditure of the regional budget, the Sultan's undisguised favor towards the Aussa area for economic development, and the intrigues of the various members of the Alimirah family with regional players.Sarah Vaughan, \\"Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia\\" (University of Edinburgh: Ph.D. Thesis, 2003), p. 213 ReferencesExternal links *Walta Information Center: Afar's spiritual leader dies at the age of 91 *Ethiopian Review: In memory of Ethiopian patriot, Sultan Alimirah Category:1919 births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:2011 deaths Category:African monarchs Category:Sultans Category:Ethiopian exiles Category:Ethiopian politicians Category:Afar people Category:Ethiopian anti- communists ","title":"Alimirah Hanfare"},{"id":"31649257","text":"John Nelson Partridge (1838 - April 8, 1920) was the Police Commissioner for Brooklyn and Fire Commissioner for Brooklyn in the 1880s before the merger into New York City.

It is used as a form genus for fossil plants with leafless flattened stems which divided dichotomously and had prominent midribs regarded as containing vascular tissues. It has been suggested that some species assigned to this genus were aquatic. Description Key features of the original definition of the genus Taeniocrada were that it possessed leafless flattened stems with prominent midribs which appeared to contain vascular tissues. As more species were added to the genus, its definition became less clear. Three of the better-known species are T. decheniana, T. dubia and T. stilesvillensis. Taeniocrada decheniana, from the Lower Devonian, had separate fertile stems which repeatedly branched in a dichotomous fashion ending in sporangia between 3 and 7 mm long. A few sporangia were borne on the sides of stems. The species was found in dense stands. It has been suggested that it was aquatic or semi- aquatic because it apparently did not have stomata on the flattened stems. Taeniocrada dubia, from the Lower Devonian, was originally considered to be a rhyniophyte, i.e. a very early vascular plant, but this has been questioned. The central strand appears to have been composed of tubes of differing diameters with helical thickenings which were part of the original cell wall, rather than being produced as the cell matured as would be the case in the xylem of vascular plants. Taeniocrada stilesvillensis, from the Upper Devonian of New York, had stems which divided either into two equal branches (i.e. dichotomously) or so that one branch was more of a 'main stem' than the other (i.e. pseudomonopodially). Ridges along the stem bore hair-like structures. True vascular tissue was present. A further nine species still considered to be part of the genus are listed and in some cases briefly described by Taylor (1986). Taxonomy The genus Taeniocrada has a somewhat complex taxonomic history. It was created by White with the species T. lesquereuxii for fossils previously regarded as algae but which proved to have vascular tissue. (The date of creation is variously given as 1902, 1903 and 1913.) It was basically a form genus, used for fossil plants with flattened membrane-like stems, which were leafless with a prominent central thickened strand and which showed dichotomous branching. In 1986 Taylor noted that as more species had been added to the genus, the characters it possessed became wider, so that some species had sporangia which were at the ends of stems (terminal), others had sporangia borne on the sides of stems (lateral). Some species had smooth stems, other had stems with 'emergences' (e.g. spines or hairs). Some were known to have vascular tissue, others not. He concluded that the genus no longer matched any existing description and that its species probably belonged to more than one genus. He also suggested that the flattening of the stems might be artefacts of preservation. In 1985, Fairon-Demaret created a new genus for fossils previously assigned to Taeniocrada but which had single lateral sporangia. She transferred T. langii (named by Stockmans in 1939) to Stockmansella langii, leaving Taeniocrada for fossil plants with terminal sporangia borne on branched structures. Phylogeny Following Taylor (1986), Crane et al. (2004) regard Taeniocrada as a polyphyletic genus (i.e. a mixture of species with no close common ancestor). Some species may belong to the Rhyniopsida as defined by Kenrick and Crane.

It is located south-southwest of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Initially established in 1941 as a training airfield for the Army Air Forces, during World War II, Baer Field became a major training and aircraft processing base for C-47 Skytrain and C-46 Commando transport aircraft, equipping many Troop Carrier squadrons with aircraft and training their aircrews in their operation. Largely turned over to civil control after the war, the Air Force has maintained control over a small section of the civil airport for reserve training and Air National Guard use. Since 1952 it has been the home station of the Indiana Air National Guard 122d Fighter Wing. History=Paul Baer Originally named Baer Army Air Base (or more colloquially, Baer Field), the base was named after Paul Baer, a Fort Wayne native, born in 1894. Baer, a sixteen victory Flying ace, flew with the Lafayette Escadrille and the 103d Aero Squadron American Expeditionary Force Air Service during World War I. Bear was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Legion of Honor, and the French Croix de Guerre. Baer continued to fly after the war, opening air mail routes in South America, and participating in many aviation experiments. Baer was killed on 9 December 1930 in a Loening C-2-H amphibian while flying mail and passengers for Chinese Airway Federal, Inc. The craft crashed on takeoff from Shanghai, China. Baer is buried in Fort Wayne.Preparing C-47s for War (Baer Field) First World War.Com Paul Baer  Origins  left Baer Field was unique in that its establishment at Fort Wayne was at the request of the city. The location for many airbases was often a decision by the War Department with little input by the people affected. The citizens of Fort Wayne wanted the base, and the city took options to buy 700 acres for that purpose should the War Department decide to build a field there. The decision to build at Fort Wayne came quicker than expected. Early in January 1941 the War Department told the town it would locate a base there if possession of the land could be had by February 1. That was less than 30 days away. It was simply not possible to handle the real estate and financial matters that quickly. However the situation was saved by 30 businessmen, who signed notes totaling the $125,000 needed. Then four of the local banks advanced the city that amount to buy the land. Land owners were told to be ready to vacate in 15 days. The federal government signed a $1 annual lease, and now the construction could begin.AFHRA Search Baer Field The land was cleared and the site prepared for construction. There were eight homes, seven barns, and some other buildings to be razed. The airfield consisted of three concrete runways with bituminous shoulders, 6230x148(NE/SW), 6300x148(NW/SE), 6000x175(N/S) including three large parking ramps, several hangars, a control tower and other auxiliary support aircraft buildings. The ground station, located to the north of the airfield, consisted of more than one hundred buildings, all intended to be temporary. Station buildings and streets were also constructed, the buildings consisting primarily of wood, tar paper, and non-masonry siding. The use of concrete and steel was limited because of the critical need elsewhere. Most buildings were hot and dusty in the summer and very cold in the winter. Water, sewer and electrical services were also constructed. Initially there was no paving to the streets, compressed earth served immediate needs. The major part of the original building project was finished by July 1941, about 150 days after the lease for the land was signed by the War Department. and the United States Army Air Forces took possession of the field on 31 October. World War IIOperational training base= left The Army Air Forces assigned jurisdiction of Baer Field initially to I Fighter Command, First Air Force. The major responsibility of the First Air Force was the organization and training of bomber, fighter and other units and crews for assignment overseas. The 31st Pursuit Group, the first to be equipped with the P-39 Airacobra, was assigned to Baer Field on 6 December 1941. It consisted of the 39th, 40th and 41st Pursuit Squadrons. However Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the next day. Training was accelerated when Nazi Germany declared War on the United States on 11 December. Part of the group left four days later and by February the within weeks the entire group was gone. By June they had deployed to England as part of VIII Fighter Command where they would be equipped with Supermarine Spitfires They entered combat in August 1942.Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. .Maurer, Maurer (1982). Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II, Office of Air Force history (1982). The 78th Fighter Group was activated at Baer Field on 9 February 1942. It consisted of the 82d, 83d and 84th Fighter Squadrons. The 78th was equipped with the P-38E Lightning, the first major production version of the aircraft and its planned mission was bomber escort for B-17 Flying Fortress flying from England against targets in Occupied Europe. The group trained at Baer Field until April when it moved out to California to train in the desert air of the Mojave Desert at Muroc Army Airfield. The group deployed to England in December 1942 and later transferred to the Twelfth Air Force in North Africa.Martin B-26 MarauderThe mission of First Air Force was changed in early 1942 to the defense of the Atlantic Seaboard, and jurisdiction of Baer Field was transferred to III Bomber Command, Third Air Force in March 1942. In May 1942 elements of the 38th Bombardment Group, equipped with B-26 Marauders stopped for servicing while on their way to the West Coast. This group would later participate in the Battle of Midway. The airfield was closed to traffic beginning in June 1942 in order for additional construction to be completed. Some of the changes made during this time were strengthening the runways, necessary to accommodate the increasing weight of the B-26 Marauder bombers, C-46 Commandoes, and C-47 Skytrain transports. Additional hangars were also constructed to accommodate the maintenance of large numbers of aircraft. In addition, the ground station streets were paved. =Aircraft/Crew processing center= left By September 1942 the runways were again open, and III Bomber Command used Baer Field as a staging and processing facility for B-26 Marauder medium bombardment groups. At Baer the newly manufactured aircraft were ferried from the Martin manufacturing plant near Baltimore, Maryland and assigned to the 1st Concentration Command (1st CC). The 1st CC was responsible for completing the organization and equipment of tactical and combat bombardment groups prior to their deployment to the overseas combat theaters. The sub-depot facilities made necessary modifications to the B-26 aircraft which had bern ferried to the airfield. The modifications updated the B-26 to current requirements. The sub-depot augmented the ground support echelons of the units in support the air echelons of the bombardment groups. In March 1943, jurisdiction of the base was again reassigned from Third Air Force to I Troop Carrier Command (I TCC), part of First Air Force. The mission of I TCC was to train C-46 Commando and C-47 Skytrain Troop Carrier (Transport) groups in preparation for overseas deployment to the various combat theaters. Baer's responsibility was the processing of Troop Carrier Command units for I TCC, by providing the groups with aircraft and providing the necessary training for their maintenance and support. Large numbers of aircraft and crews were joined at Baer and from there were deployed overseasDouglas C-47 SkytrainThe processing of the transport aircraft was performed in a similar manner as was done previously with the B-26 medium bombers. After the plane's manufacture, primarily at the Douglas C-47 plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, or the Curtiss-Wright C-46 plants in St. Louis, Missouri or Louisville, Kentucky, the aircraft was flown to an Air Technical Service Command modification center. At the modification center, the plane was updated according to the latest modification orders and received the necessary equipment and changes to suit it for its final destination. From the various modification centers the aircraft were flown to Baer Field. Aircraft were parked everywhere including two of the three runways. The hardstands were also packed with new aircraft awaiting processing. Baer's responsibility was to inspect the aircraft and make any appropriate final changes; i.e., install long-range fuel tanks, remove unnecessary equipment, and give it a final flight safety test. Baer's inspection of the aircraft was very detailed and involved considerable maintenance, repair and modification. There were two stages. The first was an assembly-line type of operation in the largest hangar where everything was checked. Examples of some of the problems found were leakage of hydraulic fittings, generators not working, loose electrical fittings, instruments inoperative, low fluid levels and missing parts, especially clocks. One C-46 arrived with a block of wood in a carburetor air filter. The second stage was the last inspection. Here the plane was flight tested and then turned over to its crew. The engines were run up, the plane taxied and then flown by military crews to check instruments, radios and single engine operation. The planes were flown north from Baer to Kendallville, Indiana, and back to Baer. This was about 80 miles round trip. Around Kendallville one engine was shut down to see how the aircraft handled. The military flew the planes during the test flight, but often the pilot would be accompanied by a civilian test pilot. When the flight turned up additional problems they were corrected by the Flight Test section. There were Pratt and Whitney technical representatives on the field for the engines, as well as other factory representatives from Douglas and Curtiss-Wright for the airframes. Once completed, the aircraft was delivered to its squadron aircrew. Long range fuel tanks were installed in the fuselage for its overseas movement. If the plane was going to England over the North Atlantic Route it received two 100 gallon tanks; to Africa over the South Atlantic Route required four 100 gallon tanks, and the very long- distances of the South Pacific Route, then eight 100 gallon tanks were installed due to the vast distances between island airfields. Extra oil was also required and this was put into a 50-gallon drum with a hose to each engine through the wing. When the oil level got low more would be hand pumped from the drum to the engines oil tank. While the planes were being serviced and made ready for overseas movement, personnel for these planes were also being processed. Pilots, co-pilots and crew chiefs being assigned as a crew for each aircraft. In some cases a Navigator was assigned, depending upon the ships destination. The process typically took 2–3 weeks. Paperwork was handled, equipment was issued and some training accomplished. Baer would process between 10–40 crews per day. Early in the war, a lot of training was very brief or non-existent. This was particularly true where men and machines were rushed into combat to meet an enemy that had been preparing and fighting for years. This low level of training was also true for crew chiefs. This would change. Training films were first used at Baer in June 1942 and by August 1943 there were 165 training films; later on this would grow to 485 films and numerous other training aids. New groups which were processed through Baer Field prior to their deployments overseas were: * 436th Troop Carrier Group * 375th Troop Carrier Group * 403d Troop Carrier Group * 433d Troop Carrier Group * 434th Troop Carrier Group * 435th Troop Carrier Group * 437th Troop Carrier Group * 438th Troop Carrier Group * 439th Troop Carrier Group * 440th Troop Carrier Group * 441st Troop Carrier Group * 442d Troop Carrier Group Beginning in 1944, Baer repaired and refurbished \\"war weary\\" aircraft which were returned from their combat assignments and were overhauled and inspected. After April 1944, new aircrew training was suspended and replacement aircraft for overseas units were processed through Baer, with WASP and ATC Ferrying Command pilots moving checked out aircraft to their worldwide destinations. In addition Lend-Lease C-47s bound for Russia and Great Britain were processed through Baer Field, then turned over to Air Transport Command ferrying crews for subsequent ferrying overseas. Postwar use 100px Baer continued as a staging base for the I Troop Carrier Command until early May 1945, when its mission changed. With the end of the European War, the base now became an assembly station for redeployment of personnel from Europe to the Pacific Theater. Aircraft staging activities were no longer conducted at the base, however it remained under the jurisdiction of I Troop Carrier Command. Throughout the summer of 1945 many Troop Carrier Groups, which had been equipped and trained at Baer returned to the base from their overseas assignments where they were demobilized and the aircraft were ferried to storage depots in the southwest. This new assignment was short lived, and on 31 December 1945 Baer Field was placed on inactive status. Baer's last assignment was an Army Air Forces separation base. The 333d Army Air Force Base Unit was assigned to the base with the mission to formulate procedures for the transfer of military equipment to other Air Force bases. On 10 March 1946 the facility was turned over to the City of Fort Wayne for use as a civil airport for one dollar, and the City renamed the facility \\"Fort Wayne Municipal Airport\\". The military base was made up of more than 100 buildings, and over the years many of the military buildings were razed and the airfield re-engineered with longer runways to accommodate jet aircraft and as a civil airport. On 1 February 1947 Baer Army Air Base was declared surplus and title to most facilities were transferred to the City of Fort Wayne except for specific areas to be retained for Air Force Reserve and Indiana Air National Guard activities. The AAF maintained a small cadre of personnel at the facility. On 15 December 1946 the 439th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Reserve Training) was activated, replacing the 333d AAFBU, by which consisted of three officers and no enlisted men. The 439th AAFBU's activities consisted of screening, packing and shipping records to appropriate archive depots and furnishing information and assistance to auditors. On 1 July 1948, the 2467th Air Force Reserve Training Center opened at the base, placed under the jurisdiction of Continental Air Command, Tenth Air Force. It was inactivated due to budget constraints on 27 June 1949. Air National Guard use 100px The World War II Ninth Air Force 358th Fighter Group was inactivated after the war on 7 November 1945. The organization was turned over to Continental Air Forces, and was re-designated as the 122d Fighter Group and allocated to the State of Indiana on 24 May 1946 for use in the newly constituted Air National Guard. The unit was extended federal recognition on 9 December 1946. On 10 November 1947, federal recognition was granted to the 163d Fighter Squadron at Baer Field The 122d Fighter Group was inactive until 1 February 1951 the unit was activated and federalized due to the Korean War, and assigned to Air Defense Command. Two squadrons, the 113th and 163d were assigned and the organization was re designated as the 122d Fighter Interceptor Group, being stationed at Stout Field, Indiana. The 122d FIG initially was equipped with F-51 Mustangs, later being equipped with F-84 Thunderjets. The unit was reassigned to Baer Field on 10 March 1951 and remained under Air Defense Command as an interceptor unit until being released to state control on 17 February 1952. The ADC 4612th Air Base Squadron was activated as a provisional station administrative unit to process active-duty personnel from Baer Field to other units. The last active-duty USAF personnel departed the field on 1 June 1952.122d Fighter Wing Website On 1 November 1952 the unit was reorganized and transferred to Tactical Air Command control, being re designated as the 122d Fighter-Bomber Group and equipped with the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star in September 1954. The jet era continued with the conversion to the F-86 Sabre eighteen months later, and in January 1958, the Republic F-84 Thunderstreak gave the 122 TFW a new dimension for the next thirteen years. Until 2010, the 122 FW flew the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon in a multirole fighter mission. As a result of BRAC 2005, the unit converted to the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft and a close air support (CAS) mission, said conversion having been completed in 2010. The installation was subsequently redesignated as Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base.http://www.122fw.ang.af.mil/ Role and operations F-16 Fighting Falcon and A-10C Thunderbolt II.

Music and career Born in Sicily, Paci started playing the piano as a young child and picked up the trumpet at age 10. By 13, he was playing with traditional Sicilian jazz and performing in some of Italy's most famous clubs. Paci moved to South America in 1990 where he traveled to play cumbia and popular music in Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. Further trips to the Canary Islands and Senegal helped him to train and develop his musical influences. These travels set Paci on the path that would lead him into a series of collaborations and tours involving music projects, film, television and political causes, including relief efforts in Africa and Amnesty International's campaign against violence on women. Returning to Italy, Paci entered the alternative rock scene to play with several bands, including Persian Jones, Qbeta, Mau Mau, Banda Ionica, and ZU. Paci's tastes reflected his broad influences and these bands played musical styles ranging from ska and punk to free jazz and Italian funeral marches. In 1999 Roy Paci met French/Spanish(Basque) musician Manu Chao with whom he recorded the critically acclaimed album Próxima Estación: Esperanza. Paci continued to record with Chao and toured extensively with his group Radio Bemba Sound System. In 2001 Paci began a long-standing collaboration with Dutch post-punk band The Ex, touring and recording with their Ex Orkest, a 20-piece band made up of various European improvisors revolving around The Ex's scratchy anarcho-punk anthems. Along with Wolter Wierbos (trombone), Mats Gustafsson and Ken Vandermark (saxophones), Paci has continued to tour with The Ex as a member of Brass Unbound and contributed trumpet tracks for the band's album Catch My Shoe. In 2002 Paci formed his own band Aretuska and founded the record label Etnagigante in 2003 to produce their second album Tuttapposto, which explored calypso, rocksteady and swing rhythms alongside new arrangements of classic Sicilian folk music. Collaborations continued with Tony Scott, Mike Patton, Gogol Bordello, Shantel and Zap Mama. In 2006 Paci joined forces with Grammy Award-winning klezmer musician Frank London and Balkan brass band leader Boban Markovic for an album combining Paci's Sicilian tradition with Jewish melodies and Balkan sounds called Trumpet Triumph. In 2018, Paci entered the Sanremo Music Festival in collaboration with Diodato, entering the song \\"Adesso\\" and finishing 8th overall. Theatre, television and cinema Roy Paci has worked for the Italian alternative theater scene, putting up the show Poetry and Andalusia, which was performed in Italy's the most prominent avant-garde theaters. Paci's penchant for experimental theater and music mingled in the Trade Almost telepathy, written by Ivano Fossati and subsequently released as audiobooks. Starting in 2005, Roy Paci's group Aretuska served as the house band on popular Italian television shows, making him and his music familiar to the general public. Paci has composed film scores for Italian cinema and several of Paci's songs have been commissioned for film soundtracks, including a version of \\"Besame Mucho\\" in Leonardo Pieraccioni's 2003 film Suddenly Paradise.

The son of the assassinated Giacomo II da Carrara, he succeeded him as lord of Padua by popular acclamation. In 1356 he was named imperial vicar by emperor Charles IV. In 1360 he obtained by Louis I of Hungary the cities of Feltre and Belluno with their territories, as well as Valsugana, which controlled the trades to Trentino. In 1372-1373 he fought a fruitless war against his powerful neighbor, the Republic of Venice. In 1375-1381 he sided with the Genoa in the War of Chioggia, after which he obtained by Leopold III of Austria the city of Treviso. In 1385, he allied with the Visconti of Milan against the Scaliger of Verona. In 1387 the Paduan troops, led by John Hawkwood and his son Francesco Novello, defeated the Scaliger troops in the Battle of Castagnaro. The following year, however, Venice and Milan formed a colation against Francesco, who was forced to abdicate in favour of his son and to go into exile in Lombardy. Later Gian Galeazzo Visconti transferred him first to Como, and then to the Forni jail of Monza, where he died in 1393. Francesco was a patron of the arts. He favored the University of Padua, where he called Ubaldo degli Ubaldi. He was also a friend of Francesco Petrarca, whom he donated an estate in Arquà. He married Fina Buzzaccarini and their daughter Cecilia of Carrara (d. 1435) married Wenceslaus I, Duke of Saxe- Wittenberg. His other daughter, Caterina, married the Croatian count Stephen II of Frankopan, lord of Krk: their only surviving daughter Elizabeth married Frederick II, Count of Celje. After the death of Francesco's grandson Marsilio, the offspring of those two marriages remained Francesco's only surviving legitimate male descendants.

Knit the City is a group of \\"graffiti knitting and crochet\\" street artists founded in London, England in 2009. The collective is credited with being the first to go beyond the simple 'cosies' of early graffiti knitting to tell 'stitched stories', using knitted and crochet amigurumi creatures and objects in their public installations. This practice has been taken up by groups internationally. The title Knit the City: A Whodunnknit Set in London by Deadly Knitshade was published in German by [Hoffmann Und Campe] in February 2011, and in the UK by Summersdale in September 2011. The book covers the group's history and showcases examples of their street art. The street art has been called \\"knit graffiti\\" and yarn bombing or \\"yarnstorming\\". The group's aim is \\"to guerilla knit the city of London, and beyond that the world, and bring the art of the sneaky stitch to a world without wool\\". Knit the City was founded by Deadly Knitshade in February 2009 with six members. The 'Yarn Corps' grew to seven members with the addition of The Fastener in late 2009. In October 2010 two members left the group and one became inactive, leaving the group with four active members. The group continued to graffiti knit as a foursome of Deadly Knitshade, The Fastener, Shorn-a the Dead and Lady Loop. History Knit the City maintains a sense of humour about their group's beginnings and tells a different story each time they are interviewed. The genuine story is that the collective was founded by Deadly Knitshade, later revealed to be author and Stitch London founder Lauren O'Farrell, who anonymously invited five hand-picked members to join forces in February 2009 on a mission to \\"turn the city knitwise\\". The collective was partly inspired by O'Farrell's 2007 London Lion Scarf charity event, when her Stitch London craft community created giant scarves for London's Trafalgar Square Lions to raise money for Cancer Research UK, and partly by a 2009 event in which Magda Sayeg of Knitta Please, Stitch London, and Guardian journalist Perri Lewis collaborated in graffiti knitting London's South Bank. Knit the City Phonebox Cosy, London, Parliament Square The members of the group use superhero-style names to hide their real identities. Initial Yarn Corps members were Deadly Knitshade, Knitting Ninja, Lady Loop, Shorn-a the Dead, Bluestocking Stitching and The Purple Purl, with the addition of The Fastener in October 2009. In creating the group's identity, Knitshade also coined the term 'yarnstorming' as a less violent alternative to the US term yarnbombing. The term has now been adopted by many groups, and was first used in the media on BBC News in June 2009. Deadly Knitshade is widely credited with innovating the concept of telling 'stitched stories' in graffiti knitting and crochet, using amigurumi knitted and crocheted characters, creatures and objects. The earliest recorded example of this is Knit the City's \\"Web of Woe\\" installation in August 2009, which was installed in London's Leake Street. The concept has since been adopted by groups worldwide and made national news. In late August 2009 the group became the first graffiti knitting collective to publicise a 'live yarnstorm' on the Twitter social network, involving the six churches of the Oranges and Lemons nursery rhyme and publishing images of their six-hour \\"Oranges and Lemons Odyssey\\" installation in real time. In late 2010 three members (Bluestocking, Ninja and Purler) left the group and Knit the City continued as a foursome. Their work was highlighted by 'The Graffiti Knitting Epidemic' interview with Knitshade, published in The Guardian newspaper, and an appearance ITV's This Morning. In April 2011 Knit the City yarnstormed in Berlin to launch the German edition of their book, Knit the City: Maschenhaft Seltsames by Deadly Knitshade (published by Hoffmann und Campe). The UK version of the book Knit the City: A Whodunnknit Set in London by Deadly Knitshade was released in the UK in September 2011 (published by Summersdale). Art Installing their fibre art in broad daylight in busy public areas, Knit the City add a paper or fabric tag onto each work, bearing the logo and website address and the phrase \\"Confess your theft\\". They encourage members of the public to take their items. They began their work with a simple 'cosy', a wooden barrier in London's Covent Garden before going on to make their most well-known piece, the Phonebox Cosy, a handknitted cosy made to fit a telephone box in London's Parliament Square while leaving the phonebox usable. From here pieces developed into 'stitched stories' beginning with the \\"Web of Woe\\", a 13-foot spider web, complete with spider and victims, in London's Leake Street, Twitter's first live yarnstorm involving the six churches of the Oranges and Lemons nursery rhyme, a Wall of Wonderland outside the South Bank's IMAX to celebrate Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland remake, a ballerina statue at the Royal Opera House covered in characters from the Nutcracker Suite, and a string of knitted hearts which they hung from the statue's bow in Piccadilly Circus seven metres high. The artists have also shown work at Tate Britain and have taken part in art projects outside the UK. They have also been commissioned to produce installations by knitwear design company John Smedley at their flagship store and computer-games giant Nintendo.

It was produced by Matthias Ehrenberg and filmed in Mexico City. The script was written by Luis Dawn and shows the experiences of Javier Herrera, an unlucky cardiovascular surgeon who, after being left by his wife María, must fight the problems of his love life upon not being able easily to forget his former mate. In the end, he meets Julia, an unmarried mother who works in a pet shop, with whom he falls in love and who helps him to bear his separation. No eres tú, soy yo was released 27 August 2010 in México.  Synopsis  Javier Herrera (Eugenio Derbez) is a man in love whose world comes crashing down shortly after his wedding when his wife, María (Alejandra Barros) tells him that she loves someone else. He must start over completely, with no money and no job, and a totally empty apartment. He tries esoteric therapies and even adopts a dog to attract women, but to no avail: Javier only remembers his ex- wife. Enter Julia (Martina García), a free-spirited young woman willing to be his friend unconditionally, if only Javier could forget Maria.  Cast  * Eugenio Derbez as Javier Herrera In an interview with Cinemanía magazine, Derbez commented on the character: \\"He's complicated ... he has this feminine side that often we do not see in men: one enamored with his wife, whose world ends when she leaves him; it is to teach the women that the men cry, too, that we can die of love and of a broken heart.\\" Unlike Derbez' previous projects, this one did not involve him in any technical aspect of the film. * Alejandra Barros as María * Martina García as Julia About their participation in the film, García remarked: \\"Alexander is an passionate, indulging director, very clear in what he asks of you. It has been precious to work with him. He has seemed to me a truly exception human being and director.\\" * Mauritius Herrera as Ramiro * Gina Morett as Georgina * Aaron Hernán as Horacio * Blancha Sanchez as Estela * Juan Ríos Cantú as Martín * Héctor Grouse as Edmundo the Psychiatrist. * Mónica Dionne as Dra.

The main filming sites were the Inner Circuit, some zones in Pedregal de San Ángel (Jardines del Pedregal) and the Colonia del Valle and Colonia Narvarte neighborhoods in Mexico City.  Promotion, opening and earnings  The first promotional poster debuted 12 May 2010, showing the film's title over a red, torn background and the lone phrase, \\"Coming Soon\\" on its lower border. A little over one month later, on 15 June, the final poster was launched, with images of Derbez and Barros. The film premiered 17 August 2010 in the complex Cinemark Reforma 222 theatre in the Federal District, and went on to open the Sixth Annual Monterrey International Film Festival on 20 August, being exhibited also in the Second Annual Chihuahua International Film Festival one day later. Days later, 27 August 2010, was released commercially in more than 300 cinemas nationwide. In its first three days of exhibition, No eres tú, soy yo collected a total of 18.4 million MXN, making it the fourth-highest-earning romantic comedy in Mexico, with 377,000 viewers altogether, behind only Enchanted (2007; 30.3 million MXN), What Happens in Vegas (2008; 21.4 million MXN) and The Proposal (2009; 18.7 million MXN). In addition, it is Derbez' highest-earning debut, surpassing La Misma Luna (2007), and also becoming Mexico's sixth-highest in opening-weekend earnings, behind Otra película de huevos y un pollo (2009), El crimen del Padre Amaro (2002), Una película de huevos (2006), Rudo y Cursi (2008) y High School Musical: El Desafío (2008). Due to the success of the opening, it was announced that the film would be released in September in at least 20 additional cities across the country. Exactly a month after its opening in cinemas, the film collected more than 100 million MXN, according to a report published by the National Chamber of the Cinematographic and Videogram Industry (CANACINE). Due to this last development, No eres tú, soy yo became the ninth highest-grossing film in the history of Mexican cinema, exceeding in gains the productions Arráncame la vida (2008; 97 million MXN) and Amores perros (2000). In fact, the film is considered the most-seen film in Mexico during September 2010, the month in which the Bicentennial of the Independence of Mexico was celebrated. According to Derbez: \\"I foresaw that it would be a good film, but you never can foresee this success because the cinema is very complicated. I am very thankful to the people, who have taken two films past the 100 million mark [referring to La misma luna], and in the top ten, has me fascinated, I can't believe it.\\"  References  External links  * * * * Category:Mexican films Category:Spanish-language films Category:2010 films ","title":"No eres tú, soy yo"},{"id":"31649401","text":"International business strategy refers to plans that guide commercial transactions taking place between entities in different countries. Typically, international business strategy refers to the plans and actions of private companies rather than governments; as such, the goal is increased profit. Most companies of any appreciable size deal with at least one international partner at some point in their supply chain, and in most well-established fields competition is international. Because methods of doing business vary appreciably in different countries, an understanding of cultural and linguistic barriers, political and legal systems, and the many complexities of international trade is essential to commercial success. As historically developing countries become increasingly prominent, new markets open up and new sources of goods become available, making it increasingly important even for long-established firms to have a viable international business strategy. This is often facilitated with the use of international management consulting firms such as Oliver Wyman, Roland Berger, Amritt, or the Everest Group. Philosophy The three most prevalent philosophies of international business strategy are: * industry-based,Porter, M. (1980).

It details their personal histories, the impact of their reigns on Scandinavian history, and the political implications of disclosed dynastic ties in Europe. Sponsored mainly by Ericsson, ABB and the Swedish Postal Service, the account was published by Ristesson Ent in Ludvika and Los Angeles. A fictional chronicler called Erik, Son of Riste relates the factual story, which is followed by fact boxes about each of the 66 monarchs covered and a number of ancestry charts.

Marquard of Randeck (or of Randelle; Italian: Marquardo di Randeck; 1296 - 3 January 1381) was Patriarch of Aquileia from 1365 until his death. Biography He was born at Augsburg, the son of a knight, but was educated by his uncle, the canon of the city. he was later a chancellor of emperor Charles IV at Avignon. He was appointed as prince-bishop of Augsburg in 1348. Six years later, he accompanied the emperor in his visit to Rome. The following year, Marquard was sent to Pisa to suppress an anti-imperial revolt, and was wounded in the fray. he anyway remained for a period at Pisa as imperial captain and governor in Italy. In 1356 he was captured by the condottiero Lodrisio Visconti at Casorate Primo. In 1365 the emperor made him as lieutenant general in Friuli. In the same year, pope Urban VI gave him the vacant title of Patriarch of Aquileia, and Marquard (who had to renounce Augsburg) entered at Cividale in June 1366. Marquard received a state with numerous rebellions, such as those of Gualtiero Bertoldo IV of Spilimbergo and of the lords of Duino, and in war with Albert III and Leopold III of Austria. Marquard was able to recover all the lost lands and to force his enemies, including also the counts of Gorizia, to peace. He then devoted himself to the traditional war against the Republic of Venice, in alliance with Louis I of Hungary, the Republic of Genoa, the dukes of Austria, the counts of Gorizia and Francesco I da Carrara, lord of Padua. The Venetians besieged Trieste: Lepold III arrived with 10,000 men, supported by a Genoese contingent, but they were crushed (5 September 1369) and the city surrendered. The Austrians left the alliance, and the remaining members were again defeated on the Piave (1372) and near Treviso (1373) by the Venetian doge Andrea Contarini, who had even hired Turkish mercenaries. The two parties signed a treaty of peace on 12 September 1373. During the War of Chioggia, the patriarch took advantage of the initial difficulties of the Venetians to invade Istria, capturing Koper and Pula. After a series of changes of possessions, Trieste was confirmed to the patriarchate at the Treaty of Turin (1381), although some territories in Istria were returned to Venice. Marquard was a prominent jurist, and during his reign he published the Constitutiones Patriae Foriiulii , also known as Codex Marquardianus, containing the rules which regulated law in Friuli until the 18th century. He also restored the Basilica of Aquileia, damaged by an earthquake in 1348 and rebuilt in Gothic style. Marquard died at Trieste in January 1381.

The fire disaster at Valley Parade killed 56 people and injured more than 250.  Founder  Professor David Sharpe founded the Bradford Burns Unit after he received many of the burns victims from the Bradford Fire Disaster in 1985.  Born from the Bradford Fire Disaster  On 11 May 1985, just before half time of the old Division 3 fixture between Bradford City Football Club and Lincoln City Football Club, on the last game of the 1984/85 season, a fire broke out in the G block of the main stand at Valley Parade. The fire quickly spread and within minutes the whole of the wooden main stand was engulfed, resulting in the death of 56 people and injury of over 250. After a full inquest, it was revealed that the cause of the fire was a disregarded cigarette which had been dropped where there was a build up of litter. This caught fire and with the assistance of wind and a wooden stand. Caused the fire to quickly spread. The horrific injuries that a young David Sharpe had to treat along with other staff lead to him setting up the Bradford Burns Unit at Bradford University to research ways into treating burns injuries.  Fundraising = Bantams Trek  As a result of the need for ongoing funding for the Burns Unit, In late 2010 Bantams Trek was set up to raise money for it by Bradford City assistant kit manager Graham Duckworth. It was given its name as the majority of events would involve walking. It was set up by Bradford City assistant kit manager Graham Duckworth whose first walk was from Bradford City's home ground Valley Parade to Lincoln City's home ground at Sincil Bank, a 73 miles walk completed in under 24 hours which was completed on 1 January 2011. It raised £6660 for the Bradford Burns Unit and a presentation was made at half time of the corresponding fixture between Bradford City and Lincoln City at Valley Parade on 2 February 2011.

The film received its name in reference to the NFL Draft Weekend, and focuses on the intense training leading up to the NFL Draft and the emotional roller coaster of draft day. Three of the players were selected within six picks of each other in the third round. Other individuals in the documentary include Bruce Allen, Tom Condon, Chuck Cook, Jon Gruden, Steve Hale, Michael Johnson, Mel Kiper Jr., Andy Reid, Marty Schottenheimer, Dick Selcer, Rob Stone, Lionel Taylor, Travis Wilson, and Wendy Wilson. Background In the fall of 2005, Dave Broome, executive producer of The Biggest Loser, learned of the Tom Condon film concept where cameras would follow Condon's latest clients as they prepared for the 2006 NFL Draft. Condon himself did not expect payment, but requested being listed as an executive producer on the project. After studying the idea, Broome decided the concept would be better suited for a documentary than for a feature film, modifying the original Condon concept of simply following the subjects to include interviews and personal vignettes within the narrative. Upon Condon's agreeing, Broome arranged financing and distribution. When Red Envelope Entertainment gave the go-ahead, Broome in 2005 hired Don Argott to direct, and in winter 2006, Argott and Condon went to the IMG training academy in Bradenton, Florida to meet the players and begin filming. However, during production, Condon left IMG to join Creative Artists Agency, taking his clients with him. One of the contractual conditions for filming IMG athletes at the IMG Academy, was that the film would be subject to IMG's artistic approval. With Condon leaving the project, Broome and Argott were worried that IMG would invoke this clause to shut down the project. After completion of principal filming, Argott spent several months editing more than 150 hours of video to create the 92-minute film. Red Envelope Entertainment promoted the film to home video and television distribution contacts, and even considered trimming the film to a 42-minute length for ESPN to include as part of their 2007 NFL Draft coverage. However, during the film's post-production, Netflix learned that Condon refused to sign a release to appear on film. According to his attorney, Condon was unhappy after seeing a screening of the film, believing that it did not reflect his clients or the draft processes properly, and asserting that the production company had verbally promised him the final right to artistic sign-off. Broome contended that Condon wished to sabotage the project because he did not do well in the draft and was worried other sports agents might use this as leverage against him. Broome further denied that he or any producer would ever verbally give away final approval to a subject in a documentary. In 2007, the NFL and NFL Properties expressed concerns about whether the filmmakers had obtained rights to certain used footage, and shortly thereafter ESPN broke off negotiations. Broome felt this was because ESPN would rightly question why an executive producer would disavow a project and why the NFL would question rights to air footage. And when the 2007 NFL Draft passed without the film being able to be aired, Broome's production company, First and Ten Productions, filed a lawsuit against Condon and NFL Productions. Included among their charges were \\"intentional interference with a contractual relationship,\\" alleging that \\"Condon willfully and maliciously interfered ... by falsely representing to the National Football League that Plaintiff had not obtained all necessary rights to the combine footage or to the use of Condon's name, image and likeness.\\" The suit against the NFL was settled for undisclosed terms and they were subsequently removed as defendants in the lawsuit, leaving Condon as sole defendant.

She used the pen name “Stuart Sterne” for her publications. Biography Bloede was born in Dresden, Germany. Her father and mother were refugees who fled Germany after the revolution of 1848. The family arrived in the United States in 1850, where her mother, Marie Bloede, became noted for her poetry and prose, and her father, Gustavus Bloede, edited the New-Yorker Demokrat, a Republican newspaper. Her parents were good friends of poet and literary critic Bayard Taylor, at whose home they met Edmund Clarence Stedman, Richard Henry Stoddard, Thomas Bailey Aldrich and other well-known poets and authors of the United States. Bloede was privately educated. Beginning in 1861, she made her home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, living with her sister, the wife of S. T. King, at 34 Greene Ave. Bloede's brief self-assessment of her work and personality was: “There is very little to tell. I have published five volumes of poems, and that is all. I live very quietly. I go into society but little, and I do not belong to anything.” Bloede professed to find in the city the seclusion which pastoral poets find in rural life. Although she went into society but little, she numbered among her friends prominent literary people of New York. She was not a member of any of the women's organizations in Brooklyn, as she felt that the art work of societies from which men were excluded amounted to little. She was interested in art, music and languages. She spoke English, French and German with fluency, and read Dutch, Italian and Latin with ease. She died, aged 60, in Baldwin, Long Island. Work Bloede's childhood surroundings and talents impelled her to write. Her first book was a small volume of short poems, published in 1875. It was favorably reviewed in The New York Times. After much inquiry, Bloede learned that the review was written by Richard Grant White, who was greatly impressed by the quality of her work. That was her first critical recognition. She used the name “Stuart Sterne” for all her works, and even after that name had become widely known, very few readers were aware that its owner was a woman. She adopted the name because she felt men's work was considered stronger than women's, and she wished her work to be judged by the highest standards and to stand or fall on its own merits. In 1878, she published Angelo, which she dedicated to White. He read the manuscript, and, on his representations, a prominent Boston house published it. Its success was instantaneous. It went through sixteen printings. She also published Giorgio (Boston, 1881), a long poem; Beyond the Shadows and Other Poems (Boston, 1888); and Piero da Castiglione (Boston, 1890), a story in verse of the time of Savonarola. She also produced a novel, The Story of Two Lives (New York, 1892). Her biographer for American National Biography, Ann Perkins, notes that, although she was popular in her day, Bloede's work has not aged very well. Family Her brother, Victor Gustav Bloede, was a noted chemist. Her sister, Kate (1848-1891), was the first wife of artist Abbott Handerson Thayer.

Waingaro River initially flows east down a straight valley formed by the southern flanks of Snowdon Range and the northern flanks of Lockett Range within Kahurangi National Park. The headwater is near the Waingaro Peak within the Lockett Range, accessible via a tramping track from Fenella Hut. Shortly upstream of the confluence with the Stanley River, the only bridge over the Waingaro River is located. This simple suspension bridge gives access for trampers to Waingaro Forks Hut. Downstream from here, the Waingaro River turns to flow generally north close to the eastern edge of Kahurangi National Park. Once it reaches the Takaka Plains it flows northeast to reach the Tākaka River eight kilometres south of Tākaka, just downstream where State Highway 60 crosses the Tākaka River. The Waingaro River caused flooding on the Takaka Plains in Easter 2016 and in January 2017. Legal action was taken in 2016 over Waingaro River irrigation consents amid concerns that this may adversely affect the nearby Te Waikoropupū Springs. Whilst the springs themselves are protected, the acquifer feeding the system is not. In April 2018, a Water Conservation Order hearing for the springs was held. As of November 2019, no decision had been released. There are three rivers on the Takaka Plains and during times of early colonial settlement, drownings were common as no bridges had been built yet.

After some initial personnel changes, in early 1970 the line-up consisted of Lee, Shakespeare and Fogg with the addition of Steve Coe on keyboards. They were based in Blackpool in North-West England. In November 1970 they cut their first album, entitled simply \\"Complex\\", which was released in May 1971. Originally devised as a demonstration record (demo) for bringing the band to the attention of major record companies for the purpose of obtaining a recording contract, it was recorded at \\"107 Studio\\" in St. Annes, engineered and mixed down by Graham Atkinson. 99 (vinyl) copies of the album were pressed by Craighall Studios in Scotland. The reason for such a limited release was the imposition of Purchase Tax on quantities greater than 99. Due to a manufacturing defect, the sleeve was slightly smaller than the record, so plain white sleeves were used to store both the album and sleeve. The album went on to become quite famous in \\"psych\\" album circles - \\"... one of the 'Holy Trinity' items of rare British psychedelia ...\\" and at one stage was fetching $6,000 on eBay for each copy. Later in 1971, they recorded a second album, The Way We Feel, released in August that year. An unauthorised bootleg of the self-titled debut was made in 1991, released on Swank Records. 1999 limited-edition re-releases of both Complex and The Way We Feel were authorised by the band on Wooden Hill records (Vinyl and CD versions). This was of much better quality soundwise, had bonus tracks and was quickly sold out. In 2011, Complex was reissued on CD without the bonus tracks but including an interview with the band members.

The festival was founded in 1966, and is considered one of the major cultural events of the whole of Slavonia, together with Brodsko kolo and Đakovački vezovi. History The first Vinkovačke jeseni where organised in September 1966. In the foreground of this festival is the care of folk dances, folk clothing and folk customs, so that traditional values from folk live of Slavonia would be kept. In late September 2017 the event was criticized by the individuals from the Serbian Cultural Society \\"Prosvjeta\\" for the two decades long exclusion of folk cultures coming from ethnic minorities in Croatia, especially Serb minority that constitute 15,50% of the entire population of Vukovar-Srijem County. Svetislav Mikerević, President of local Prosvjeta branch in Bobota, stated in an interview that \\"We are as well citizens of Croatia. We are indeed minority, but culture is not supposed to divide people. It is supposed to connect people, and what we have is culture with borders. It would be natural if we were invited...\\" General Vinkovačke jeseni are held each year in the month of September, which is also the beginning of autumn, after which this gestival got his name. The reason for establishment of this Festival is that the autumn is the season that awards the most to the People of Slavonia for their hard labor. This gestival has soon started to bind all of those who are lovers of cultural heritage, dialects, and old customs. In the days of the gestival the audience finds out everything about the diversity of the golklore in Slavonia, and about the foreign golklores that also participate in Vinkovačke jeseni. The stage is for the duration of the gestival provisionally made, and is designed as an open-air Stage. The costumes and the scenography are thematic so in that comes the beauty of shapes and colors of the garments and the sounds of tamburica and gaida to light. Attractions * The Opening Ceremony - one of the most visited Events during the Vinkovačke jeseni. The “Opening Ceremony” is actually a mass of people that goes along the streets of Vinkovci and observes the progress of the parade. In this event it is significant to mention the procession of the horsepeople on the horses that move in front of the procession of the people. * The Review of Original Croatian Folklore - The Review begins after the Opening Ceremony, and lasts for two days. On the review, at first, enter the two most successful folklore associations, first the ones from Vinkovci, and then the other folklore associations from all over Croatia. * Folklore Evenings - On the folklore evenings are sung songs from around Croatia. The folklore evenings are thought for the restored, and for newly launched folklore societies. * Small Talks of the Šokci - This is an event, whose task is to represent the former way of life of the People of Slavonia, and to remember how one used to live in Slavonia.

It was first introduced as a combinatorial object by Raoul Bott and Clifford Taubes and, for this reason, it is also sometimes called the Bott–Taubes polytope. It was later constructed as a polytope by Martin Markl and by Rodica Simion. Rodica Simion describes this polytope as an associahedron of type B. The cyclohedron is useful in studying knot invariants. Construction Cyclohedra belong to several larger families of polytopes, each providing a general construction. For instance, the cyclohedron belongs to the generalized associahedra that arise from cluster algebra, and to the graph-associahedra, a family of polytopes each corresponding to a graph. In the latter family, the graph corresponding to the d-dimensional cyclohedron is a cycle on d+1 vertices. In topological terms, the configuration space of d+1 distinct points on the circle S^1 is a (d+1)-dimensional manifold, which can be compactified into a manifold with corners by allowing the points to approach each other. This compactification can be factored as S^1 \\\\times W_{d+1}, where W_{d+1} is the d-dimensional cyclohedron. Just as the associahedron, the cyclohedron can be recovered by removing some of the facets of the permutohedron.

History This roughly oval-shaped loch was about three miles to the south-west of Maybole.

It is the outflow of the Upper Lake Constance and the main tributary of the Lower Lake Constance. The water level of the lower lake is about 30 cm below the level of the Upper Lake. It is considered part of the Rhine, which flows into Lake Constance as the Alpine Rhine and flows out of the Lake as the High Rhine. The Seerhein arose after the last Ice Age (the Würm glaciation, about 9650 BCE). Some time after this period, the water level of Lake Constance gradually dropped by about ten metres and the shallow parts fell dry. Some parts of the Seerhein still have a character a bit like a lake. The border between Germany and Switzerland runs down the center of the lower stretch of the river; the German city of Constance, the largest community on the river, is situated on both sides of the upper part.  Location = General  Satellite image of the Lake Constance Basin. Between the larger Upper Lake Constance and the smaller the Lower Lake Constance, the Seerhein can be seen. The Seerhein extends over a length of 4.3 km from the old bridge across the Rhine in Constance in the east to the island of Triboldingerbohl in the west. Narrow side channels extend between this island, the island of and the Wollmatinger Ried. The Seerhein is between 100 and 500 metres wide and between 7 and 25 metres deep. About halfway, there is an unnamed, shallow, widening, which looks a bit like a small lake. The Seerhein has some small streams as tributaries, both on the left side: the Dorfbach near Gottlieben and the Grenzbach (\\"Border Brook\\") on the western city limits of Constance. Most of the river, including the entire north shore and the eastern part of the southern shore, is located on German territory. On the western two kilometers, the border between Germany and Switzerland runs through the middle of the river. On the Swiss side the minucipalties of Tägerwilen and Gottlieben border the river; the German side the city of Constance and the Landkreis of municipality of Reichenau. The Swiss city of Kreuzlingen is considered part of the agglomeration centered on Constance. On the South bank, we find the old city center of Constance and the former villages of Paradies; the densely populated area between these centers was built up in the 19th and 20th Centuries. On the Swiss part of the South bank, we find the villages of Gottlieben and Tägermoos. Tägermoos is politically in the Swiss municipality of Tägerwilen, but the City of Constance participates in its administration. On the North bank, we find Petershausen and Stromeyersdorf; both are now districts of Constance. Also found on the North bank is \\"Zugwiesen\\", an exclave of the municipality of Reichenau. The Rhine Gate Tower. The old bridge across the Rhine began at this gate. The embankments in the urban area of Constance are sometimes used to moor boats. The North bank has experienced very active construction in recent years. Industrial estates were demolished and replaced by residential estates, with parks along the river. The inner city \\"Rhine Beach\\" is also situated on the North bank. Outside the city, the banks are unimproved. There are two places where swimming is permitted: the \\"Konstanzer Kuhhorn\\" in Tägermoos and the pool in Tägerwilen. The Western part of the North bank (known as the \\"Wollmatinger Ried\\") is swampy and overgrown with cane, and the same holds for the Swiss bank West of Gottlieben. Due to their size and tranquility, these marshlands are of major ecological importance. Historically interesting buildings in the Seerhein area are remains of the fortifications of Constance (Rhine Gate Tower and Powder Tower), the Petershausen Abbey, the Gottlieben Castle and former factories in Stromeyersdorf.  Seerhein valley  The Seerhein flows through a depression which is known as Seetal (\\"Lake Valley\\") or Konstanzer Niederung (\\"Constance Depression\\"). This valley is bordered on the south by the Seerücken (\\"Lake Ridge\\") and to the north from the hill country of the Bodanrück. The name Konstanzer Niederung is a contribution by Benting. It derives from his description of the Natural regions of Germany, in which the Niederung appeared as a natural subunit.Benzing, p. 11 and the Appending with maps. The Konstanzer Niederung received the signature 030/031.22. The next higher units are Central Hegau Untersee Depression (with signature 030/031.2) and Northern Lake Constance and Hegau Basin (with signature 030/031). Neighbouring regions are: in the East, the Obersee (with signature 030/031.0), in the East the Untersee (030/031.20) and the island of Reichenau (030/031.21), in the North the hill country of the Bodanrück (030/031.23) and in the South the hills of the Seerücken (no signature, because they are in Switzerland). (In 1998, the Department for the Environment of the state of Baden-Württemberg called for an updated version of Benting's list. In this new version, the old 030/031 was replaced by 030 \\"Hegau and Western Lake Constance Basin\\", see www.xfaweb.baden-wuerttemberg.de) The Swiss call the depression Seetal (\\"Lake Valley\\"). This name is used in names like Schulzentrum Seetal (\\"Seetal School'), Pumpwerk Seetal (\\"Seetal Pumping Station\\"), Seetalstrasse (\\"Seetal Street\\"), all found in Kreuzlingen. In a Swiss list of regions, Schilter included the Seetal in the Uferlandschaft (\\"River Bank Area\\"), which stretches all the way to the Romanshorn.Schilter, map 5, unit 213/10/2/5  Transport  View from Constance Minster tower to the beginning of the Seerhein Konstanz on the old bridge over the Rhine The Seerhein is navigable and is used primarily by the pleasure boats of the \\"Schweizerischen Schifffahrtsgesellschaft Untersee und Rhein\\" (\\"Swiss Shipping Company 'Untersee and Rhine'). There are three bridges across the Seerhein, all on the upper part of the river. Furthest East is the Old Rhine Bridge in Constance, near the bottleneck of the terminal moraine (see below). The current bridge was constructed in 1957, but precursors have existed since late antiquity. A little to the West, the Seerheinbrücke, a pedestrian and cycle bridge, was built in 1991. At the Western edge of Contance, the Schänzlebrücke crosses the river. It is part of the German Federal Highway 33, which turns in to Highway A7 at the border. The 555 km marker, downstream of the Loreley There used to be several ferries, one to the East of the present cycle bridge, and one between Paradies and Stromeyersdorf. In the 19th Century, distance markers where placed along the Rhine; they start counting Kilometres at the Old Bridge in Constance.  Paleogeographic Development  The entire landscape of the Seerhein and its environment is in the range of Molasse basin, which was formed during the Upper Miocene about 30 million years ago. In the next 7 million years (until now) the sedimentation exceeded the erosion. During this timeframe, the present landscape was formed. During the Pliocene and Pleistocene, erosion was dominated by the Aare and Danube, later by the High Rhine. Rivers and glaciers created furrows and basins.Schreiner, p. 164 The paleogeographic development of the Seerhein is closely connected to that of the valley through which it flows. This valley was created by the early High Rhine and the Rhine glacier and filled by different lake deposits. The entire Lake basin is characterized by the alternation of the wide basin, narrow cross valleys and mountainous landscapes. The lowlands surrounding the Seerhein are largely the result of siltation and is one of the basin landscapes; the neighbouring hill ranges Bodanrück and Seerücken are glacial molasses highlands.See Schreiner, p. 3 A decisive step in the formation of today's Seerhein and Lake Constance area took place with the deflection of the Alpine Rhine from the Danube to the Aar during Günz ice age. On the line Lake Constance-Seerhein-High Rhine enhanced vertical erosion followed, while the advancing Rhine glacier prepared today's Lake basin.Schreiner, pp. 168-169 Glacier with Ice Lake (Perito Moreno Glacier, Argentina) The retreat of the Rhine glacier (at the end of the Würm ice age) occurred as a number of melting and stationary phases, which are conventionally divided into nine stages. Stage 9, the \\"Constance\\" stage, begins with the edge of the ice at a standstill near Constance. The ice edge east of the glacier was along a line from the Lake Überlingen via the eastern tip of Bodanrück, through Constance and Kreuzlingen to the northern end of the Seerücken. Early in the Constance stage, a proglacial lake formed in the area of today's Seerhein basin and to the west of it. In this lake, extensive silty calcareous, glacilimnic layers were deposited. These appear on the surface in some places on the edge of the valley. After the Ice lake disappeared, a terminal moraine was formed, which later turned out to be important for the course of human settlement (see below). Initially, the melt water from the Lake Überlingen basin flowed through Staringen Valley; later it flowed through the Allmannsdorf melt water channel in the area of today's Seerhein depression. A melt period followed, in which all ice in the Konstanzer Trichter and Obersee melted.See Schreiner, p. 126-130, 134-137, and map After the end of the Würm Ice Age (about 9650 BC) the water level of Lake Constance was at about 405 m above the current sea level, or about 10 metres above the present level. Back then, the Seerhein valley was submerged and Lake Constance was a single lake. Deep erosion of the Rhine then lowered the lake to its current level (about 395 m). The Seerhein valley fell dry; the Upper and Lower were Lake separated, and the Seerhein emerged as the connection between the two lakes. The course of the present Seerhein may well correspond to the location of the current in the days when Lake Constance was a single lake. The former extent of the lake is indicated by typical lake deposits; in the Seerhein valley, such deposits are found all over the valley floor. These lake sediments usually have a thickness of 0.2 to 2 metres, near the Seerhein up to 13 metres. In the western part of today's depression, the surf of the lake formed many beach ridges perpendicular to the main wind direction (southwest); ridges in the Wollmatinger Ried are still well preserved. Besides the described main elements (Würm moraine, Ice Lake sediments, Lake deposits, including the beach ridges), Pleistocene talus and Holocene alluvial fan are found in Seerhein basin.See Schreiner, pp. 138-140, 170, map  History  The end moraines in the Constance depression were formed along the edge of the ice during the Constance stage (see above). In the area of the old town of Constance, we find a moraine surrounded by Lake deposits. The section of the moraine in Kreuzlingen, however, is surrounded predominantly by Pleistocene talus. Sections of the end moraine are found further north east and south east, in the area of the Bodanrück and Seerücken, respectively.Schreiner, map Sections od end moraine connecting these to the Constance section may have been eroded away, or they may never have existed due to water movement during the Constance stage. Originally, most of the basin floor was swampy or even rather wet. The moraines, however, were suitable for human settlement. The moraine of Constance has been the location of several prehistoric and early historic settlement, among them a Roman predecessor of Constance. Large parts of today's old town of Constance are on the terminal moraine, and the north-south direction of the old town is due to the direction of the moraine. By contract, Stadelhofen, the southernmost town of the Constance area, was built on the former lake bed. In Kreuzlingen, the moraine extends along the Hauptstrasse (\\"Main Street\\"), roughly from the border to the intersection with Remisbergstrasse. Both the old and the new location of the monastery at Kreuzlingen are in the area of the moraine. In the context of the tow-part Lake Constance, the Seerhein present a suitable point to construct a bridge or a ferry and to found a port town. The best place to cross the river was probably the terminal moraine bottleneck at the beginning of the Seerhein. Celtic, Roman and Alemannic, the Diocese of Constance and the Imperial Free City Constance tried to use this strategic position. View from the lake of medieval Constance (woodcut of 1553); the Seerhein is on the right In the ancient world, the Seerhein marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire for a while. In the early Middle Ages, he was the boundary between the legislative areas of Thurgau and Hegau and the northern boundary of the City of Constance. Petershausen, on the north bank opposite Constance, was founded in 983 and later became a suburb, before it was annexed by the city. The monastery was founded on the opposite bank of the Seerhien, by analogy with St. Peter's basilica in Rome, with was built on the \\"other\\" side of the Tiber. During the Middle Ages, the river bank was fortified by a city wall with several towers, which was partially built on the river. It was connected to the north bank by a stone bridge. There was a grain mill on the bridge, driven by the river. The north banks were not improved, until the area was developed for industrial uses in the 19th Century.  Water miracles of Constance  Map of the Seerhein with observatories of the \\"water miracle\\" On 23 February 1549 the \\"water miracle of Constance\\" is reported to have happened: the Seerhein rose and fell over several hours at intervals of about a quarter of an hour by a ell, more than half a meter. Fishermen on the Lower Lake reported that the water of the Rhine appeared to flow backwards. Today, this event can be explained scientifically: Certain wind conditions induce waves at the natural frequency of the upper and lower lake. This creates a seiche, i.e. standing wave, in which the entire lake resonates at its natural frequency. As it happens, Constance is close to an anti-node in this wave, making the effect especially visible.

History By the time filming began in 1969, the Bee Gees were down to a trio consisting of Barry and Maurice Gibb and the drummer Colin Petersen. Robin Gibb quit the group earlier in the year following the release of the group's fourth album Odessa. Songs for the film were recorded during the summer of 1969 with Petersen on drums, but when filming began, he was fired from the group. His scenes from the film were cut and he is not credited on the accompanying album, though he does play on some songs. Plot The plot revolves around two heirs, Prince Frederick (Barry Gibb) and his brother Prince Marmaduke (Maurice Gibb), and their dying father (Frankie Howerd). On his death bed, The King orders his kingdom divided into two halves, the Kingdom of Jelly and the Kingdom of Cucumbers. Before the king even dies, Prince Frederick declares himself the \\"King of Cucumber\\" and Prince Marmaduke becomes the \\"King of Jelly\\". The film intersperses comedy sketches with Bee Gees songs plus performances by Lulu and Blind Faith with several cameo appearances.

Life  James Barker was baptized on 20 October 1622 at Southwold, Suffolk, England, the son of James Barker. It is possible that his father was the James Barker of Southwold whose estate was administered on 5 Feb 1626/7, leaving estate to widow Elizabeth. It is also plausible that Barker lost his mother shortly thereafter, and as an orphan was then cared for by his aunt, Christian (Barker) (Cooper) Beecher. There had been a family tradition that young James Barker sailed to New England in 1634 with his father, who died en route, and with his aunt Christian who was married to Nicholas Easton. While there are possibly elements of truth in this tradition, there are also two serious flaws. The first is that it appears that James's father died several years before young James sailed to New England, based on the 1626 administration mentioned. Secondly, Christian was married to Thomas Beecher when she came to New England, in 1630. Beecher died in early 1637, so his widow did not marry Nicholas Easton until after then. It is most likely that young James Barker came to New England as an orphan with his aunt in 1630, but no documentation has been found to support this. It is almost certain, however, that Barker came to Rhode Island from Massachusetts with his aunt and her third husband, Nicholas Easton, about 1638. Once reaching adulthood, Barker became active in the civil affairs of the colony, undertaking positions as commissioner, assistant, and deputy over a period of many years. In the Rhode Island Royal Charter adopted in 1663, which became the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries, Barker was named as one of the ten Assistants (magistrates) of the colony. In 1676, during King Philip's War, it was voted that the advice of the most judicious inhabitants of the colony be obtained, and that these people sit at the next session of the assembly. Barker was one of the 16 men whose counsel was sought in this request. In 1678 he was elected as Deputy Governor, serving under governors Benedict Arnold, William Coddington, and John Cranston, the first two both dying in office in 1678. He was a Baptist minister, assisting in the ordination of Rev. Richard Dingley in 1690. His wife was Barbara Dungan, the oldest daughter of Frances Dungan and her husband William.  Family  The English background of James Barker has been discovered largely through his connection with his Aunt Christian Barker, sister of his father James. Christian and the elder James were children of an earlier James Barker and his wife, Christian King. The first James Barker was a son of William Barker, who was a son of Robert Barker. Christian Barker was married three times, first, in 1610, to Thomas Cooper, second, in 1626, to Thomas Beecher, and third, about 1637, to Nicholas Easton, who later became governor of the Rhode Island colony. This is why James Barker was called a nephew of Nicholas Easton in a 1663 deed. Christian first came to New England in 1630 with her second husband who was a mariner, and became member #17 of the Boston church in late summer of that year. It is plausible that Barker, her nephew, was orphaned at the time, and came with her. James and Barbara Barker had eight known children, all born in Newport, Rhode Island from about 1645 to 1662.

In 1961 he became a freelance rock journalist and in the 1970s he wrote a series of superficial paperback pop books, including The David Bowie Story, the first biography about the musician.

Philadelphia Museum of Art. Portrait of Madame Cézanne with Loosened Hair (or Madame Cézanne with Unbound Hair) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Paul Cézanne, variously dated from the mid-1870s to the early 1890s. Although the model, his wife Hortense Fiquet, was not supportive and did not understand or take an interest in her husband's work, this is one of forty-four portraits in which she sat for him from 1869, a period during which she progressed from mistress, to wife, to ex-wife. Something of a socialite, Cézanne latterly found Fiquet often fickle and shallow, and once remarked, \\"My wife only cares for Switzerland and lemonade\\". The sensitivity and depth ascribed to her in this work is likely drawn from his own personality and projected onto her image. While elements of the work show the influence of Impressionism, it lacks the characteristic extroverted charm of that movement, and instead focuses on the inner life of the subject. It departs from the artist's earlier portraits of his wife, whom he had earlier divorced, in its sensitivity, delicacy of tone and more relaxed countenance, as seen in the loosened fall of her hair.Cachin, et al, 346 Background Madame Cézanne in a Garden, unknown date. Here she is presented as more extroverted, and her real life restless nature is evident. In most of the other portraits Hortense Fiquet is presented in more formal attire that perhaps reflects the importance she ascribed to fashion; it is said that an appointment with a dressmaker caused her to be late to her husband's deathbed in 1906. Fiquet and Cézanne married on 28 April 1886, though by that time he had said that he no longer had any feelings for Hortense, whom one scholar has described as \\"a high-maintenance woman\\".Gascoigne, Laura. \\"Carpenter of Colour.\\" The Spectator, 8 July 2006 Although he continued to paint his wife until the 1890s, he disinherited her; their only child, Paul (1872—1947) inherited the estate.Their only child, Paul (1872—1947) inherited the estate. The settlement that Hortense received from her son was squandered through gambling.Butler, Ruth. Hidden in the Shadow of the Master: The Model-Wives of Cézanne, Monet, and Rodin. Yale University Press, 2008. After the death of Louis-Auguste Cézanne that same year, Cézanne and his wife separated, and he moved in with his sister and mother, remarking, \\"My wife only cares for Switzerland and lemonade\\".Lindsay, Jack. Cézanne: His Life and Art\\". Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1969. The psychological distance between husband and wife appears to be reflected in the portraits where she gives the impression of self-absorption.Emotion, Color, Cézanne1 (The Portraits of Hortense) The tilt of her headan angle in portraiture more usually associated with depictions of saints. and body in this work, along with the look of submission and the downward-shaped mouth, are all indicative of an inward, self-concerned nature. Yet, the image is a tender representation of a coyness, shyness and sensitivity which art historian Meyer Schapiro believed to be a projection of Cézanne's own character. One critic wrote that Cézanne painted heads as if they were apples, a tendency very evident here in the blush of her cheek and the oval shape and curves of her face. Description Woman in a Green Hat shows a similar left lean, and verticals on her dress. The work is oppressively flat and rectangular. While it lacks pictorial depth, it is highly symmetrical, showing a near full-face and centered body view, with a number of playful deviations, including the lean of her head and torso and the thick vertical line in the background which is positioned slightly to the left.Fry, 68 As with much of Cézanne's mature work, it has many abstract forms, especially the vertical lines of her dress, which echo the diagonals of her hair and join the heavy line in the background on which her head seems to rest.Schapiro, 70 The dress may be made of blue-black velvet upon which are added bands of gray satin; such striping shows up in several earlier portraits Cézanne painted of his wife. The manner in which it utilises costume and background to express tone and mood harks back to techniques used in portraiture during the early Netherlandish period, especially those by Rogier van der Weyden. Art historian Liliane Brion-Guerry saw in the painting a delicacy absent from later portraits by Cézanne, in which individual expressiveness would give way to \\"icy hardness\\": \\"The face of Madame Cézanne conveys, even in its transcription, the delicate flutter of human emotion.\\" Though criticized for her extravagances, she possessed \\"an even-tempered disposition and a tireless patience. When Cézanne couldn't sleep, she read to him in the night, sometimes for hours at a time.\\" Dating Biographers do not agree on the picture's dating and position within the series. Lionello Venturi dated it from 1883–87, and Georges Rivière placed it in the mid-1870s. For reasons of style John Rewald believed the painting was made in the early 1890s; the fuller form of the face may also indicate a later date, when Madame Cézanne would have been in her forties. If Rewald's date—now accepted by the Philadelphia Museum of Art—is accurate, the painting would be the last Cézanne made of Hortense, who first posed for him in 1869.Adriani, 153 ReferencesSources * Adriani, Götz.

Early life John Stevenson Stubbs was born on 24 September 1894. He was named after his father, who was a grocer. His mother was Jessie Stubbs. They were living at 235 County Road, Walton-on-the-Hill, Lancashire, England at the time the child was christened.

He scored his first aerial victory-a highly unusual one- on 20 May 1918; despite flying a bomber, he and his observer destroyed an enemy observation balloon over Seclin. On 6 June 1918, Stubbs and his observer, along with two other Royal Air Force air crews, set a German Fokker D.VII fighter aflame and sent another down out of control southwest of Ham, Surrey. On 4 July, Stubbs and his observer drove a Pfalz D.III fighter down out of control.

It was one of very few pre-war US artillery designs selected for wartime production in World War I, although (as with most of these projects) few of these weapons were delivered to France and used in action. A combination of a limited pre-war munitions industry, the short (19-month) US participation in the war, technical problems with large-scale production, and the ready availability of munitions overseas led to this.  History  The design was orthodox for its time with a box trail and hydro- spring recoil system. By the time of the American entry into World War I 60 had been produced and issued to the Army.Crowell, pp. 71-73 Once the US entered World War I the US Army soon decided to adopt French and British artillery systems, and it was proposed to rechamber the 4.7-inch gun to fire French 120 mm ammunition. However, the presumed effect on production was too great, and this proposal was abandoned. Another source (Hogg) states that changing over to French ammunition (of which France had only limited production in this caliber) snarled production badly in late 1918.Hogg WWI, pp. 51-53 With the war over in November of that year, 149 guns and 320 carriages were produced between early 1917 and the Armistice, after which gun production apparently ceased but carriage production continued. By the time production probably ceased on 17 April 1919, of 960 guns and 1,148 carriages ordered from 1906 through early 1917, only about 209 guns and 470 carriages were completed, according to the official history of US World War I war production, America's Munitions 1917–1918. Sixty-four of these weapons (48 from pre-war stocks) were shipped to France to equip three regiments, of which two (the 302nd and 328th Field Artillery) saw action with 48 guns total. The official history does not mention switching the 4.7-inch gun to French ammunition, but does note that 994,852 4.7-inch shells were produced by the US through 1 November 1918; many of these may have been for British consumption.Crowell, p. 121 The majority of the weapons were probably used for training in the United States, as shipments from the US to Europe were primarily men and ammunition. Regardless of what type of ammunition it used, the weapon remained in US service, though in reserve storage, until 1932. Williford states that total orders through early 1917 were 226 at Watervliet Arsenal. In early 1917 additional orders were placed at Watervliet (240 guns), Northwest Ordnance (500 guns), Walter Scott Co. (250 carriages), Studebaker (500 carriages), and Rock Island Arsenal (198 carriages). The 24 weapons emplaced on fixed pedestal mounts for land defense in the Panama Canal Zone from 1918 to 1926 were the 4.7-inch howitzer M1913, not an M1906 weapon as some sources state.Handbook of the 4.7-inch Howitzer Materiel M1913 on Pedestal Mount M1915  Ammunition  Ammunition included a base-fuzed common steel shell containing of TNT, and a shrapnel shell containing 711 balls with a 31-second combination fuze and optional tracer.

Driver (1867–1960) was a nationally-known educator and considered one of the leading experts in the field of rural school consolidation in the United States. He served for twelve years as county superintendent of schools in Randolph County, Indiana, where he made the county the national model in rural school consolidation. He later served as Director of the Bureau of Rural Education with the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction, where he oversaw the consolidation of several thousand schools. Early life Leotis Lincoln Driver was born on February 22, 1867 in Stoney Creek Township, Randolph County, Indiana. His father, a veteran of the Iron Brigade, named him for Abraham Lincoln. Driver's youth was spent in the town of Farmland, Indiana, where he completed a common school education. He later attended Central Normal College in Danville, Indiana, where he graduated in 1883. Driver taught in the district schools of western Randolph County, farmed, and did carpentry work, until 1895, when he was hired to teach at Winchester High School in Winchester, Indiana. Driver was principal of Winchester High School from 1901 until 1907. County Superintendent Lee L. Driver was elected county superintendent of schools of Randolph County, Indiana, in June 1907. When he assumed the office, the county had only one consolidated township high school and more than one hundred one-room schools. Over the course of the next twelve years, Driver would oversee the consolidation of all but nine of the county's one-room schools and the creation of fourteen additional consolidated township high schools and five consolidated township grade schools. Randolph County was widely regarded as the model county in rural school consolidation and was given attention by men like Progressive reformer Ellwood P. Cubberley, U. S. Commissioner of Education Philander P. Claxton, Albert Winship, editor of Boston's Journal of Education, and others. Pennsylvania When Governor William Cameron Sproul set out to reorganize the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction, he recruited Thomas E. Finnegan, of New York, to take charge of the department. Finnegan, in turn, was given freedom to recruit the best men in each area to oversee reforms. To oversee rural education, he selected Driver, who was the first Director of the new Bureau of Rural Education. Driver would serve in this capacity for seventeen years, surviving several political changes and overseeing the consolidation of more than 5000 schools through more than 800 separation consolidations. He retired from the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction in 1937. Legacy Driver was first listed in Who's Who in America in 1930–31. A new elementary school, near Bradford, Pennsylvania, was named in his honor in 1931. In 1956 citizens in the western portion of Randolph County, Indiana, attempted to consolidate their schools as the Lee Driver Consolidated School District, though this attempt failed by the narrowest of margins. The high school and junior high school of Winchester, Indiana, were named in Driver's honor in 1959. The junior high school, a middle school since 1984, still retains Driver's name. Driver died on October 21, 1960 in Ocala, Florida. He is buried in the Woodlawn Cemetery in Maxville, near Farmland, Indiana.

Geography  { \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\", \\"service\\": \\"geoshape\\", \\"ids\\": \\"Q319041\\", \\"title\\": \\"Obersee\\" } The Obersee has an area of 473 km² in size and extends for 63 km between Bregenz and Bodman-Ludwigshafen. Its maximum width is 14 km. It drains through the Seerhein in Constance into the Untersee. Its main inflow is the Alpine Rhine. The distinctive, northwestern arm and -large Lake Überlingen (Standard German of Germany: Überlinger See) is part of the Upper Lake Constance, as well as the Bay of Bregenz, and the Constance Hopper. The countries that border the lake are Switzerland, with its cantons of Thurgau and St. Gallen, Austria, with its federal state Vorarlberg, and Germany, with its federal states of Baden- Württemberg and Bavaria. The border between the riparian states on the south- eastern main part of the Obersee have never been jointly agreed (see Lake Constance); only the smaller northwestern water of Lake Überlingen is completely German territory.  Origin of the name  The Romans called it Lacus Venetus, Lacus Brigantinus and Lacus Constantinus. In the Middle Ages the dominant term was Lacus Bodamicus, or in German Bodensee. Gradually, this name began to include the Lower Lake (Lacus Acronius), so the term \\"Upper Lake\\" was introduced for the larger lake.

Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) was under contract to provide oversight and technical responsibility of the weapons housed at the AFS. History The Sandia National Laboratories had overseen the construction by 1950 of four \\"Q Area\\" secure special weapons areas (so named for the clearance code on the access badges) which were the storage and main stockpiles for the 298 nuclear bombs in inventory by mid-1950. Sandia Base initiated construction of the Operational Storage Site (OSS), the physically smaller alert facilities of key strategic importance, in 1950. The first five of these installations were set up by Sandia immediately neighboring selected SAC bases. Site F was located at Ellsworth AFB, near Rapid City, South Dakota and named Rushmore Air Force Station. \\"Sandia transferred operation of the five alert sites bordering the SAC bases to Air Materiel Command after a shakedown period during which Sandia personnel worked at the sites with the Air Force and AEC. Air Materiel Command designated the sites depots, with associated Air Force personnel referenced as Aviation Depot Groups, and subsequently, Aviation Depot Squadrons.\\" The 3081st Aviation Depot Wing was assigned. http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/facility/q_area-intro.htm \\"The facilities comprising the Rushmore AFS were primarily associated with the maintenance and storage of atomic and thermonuclear weapons. Storage and maintenance activities were compartmentalized to specialized facilities for each stage of maintenance for security, safety, and quality assurance. Other facilities on Rushmore AFS were to support the administrative and security requirements for the secure facility including office space, unaccompanied housing, crew readiness and dining facilities, and communications. SNL and Department of Defense (DoD) personnel performed the maintenance and storage functions required by the weapons, including transporting the weapons to the flightline and loading them into the nuclear-capable bombers assigned to Ellsworth AFB. In 1962, Rushmore AFS was transferred to Ellsworth AFB. By 1992, Ellsworth AFB was included in the newly created Air Combat Command (ACC) and the assigned B-1B bombers were adapted to a conventional mission.\\" \\"Demolition of Munitions Storage Area Facilities Environmental Assessment, Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota\\", August 2009, Section 1.2 - Background. Current day By 2009, the 28th Bomb Wing, the Ellsworth AFB host unit, began steps for the removal of eight empty or underutilized structures or those not considered mission- critical. \\"The unique construction and infrastructure included in the buildings would make it difficult to rehabilitate or renovate these buildings to another purpose. In addition, the Air Force has set a demolition goal in response to budget shortfalls to reduce the service-wide facility footprint by 20 percent between Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 and FY 2020.

While in college, he won the Florida state lightweight amateur boxing title (under the name \\"Eugene Schoor\\"). He also fought as a middleweight.\\"Olson, Schoor Box Tomorrow,\\" Miami News, May 30, 1935, p. 11. After serving in the Navy in World War Two, Schoor began a PR business in New York. His clients included Jayne Mansfield, Cindy Adams and Bess Myerson. He expanded into radio, producing \\"Champ of the Week,\\" \\"Sports Club of the Air,\\" and \\"Hour of Champions,\\" and using radio to promote client-athletes including Joe DiMaggio, Jack Dempsey, Tommy Henrich and Phil Rizzuto.  Writer  A prolific author of more than fifty books during five decades, Gene Schoor specialized in \\"juvenile\\" sports biographies but also wrote a variety of other work, including a successful pre-assassination biography of John F. Kennedy. A representative list of Schoor's \\"juvenile\\" non-fiction, once found on the shelves of elementary school libraries across the United States, would include The Story of Ty Cobb: Baseball's Greatest Player (1952), The Ted Williams Story, Christy Mathewson: Baseball's Greatest Pitcher, Roy Campanella: Man of Courage, The Story of Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle of the Yankees, Willie Mays: Modest Champion, Bob Feller: Hall of Fame Strikeout Star, and The Stan Musial Story. Gene Schoor also wrote the best-sellerThe [Dubuque] Telegraph-Herald, May 4, 1994, p. 6C (calling the book a best-seller).

(Schoor may have come to the attention of the Kennedys after sending Robert F. Kennedy a number of his sports biographies; Kennedy thanked Schoor in a letter of March 1961, commenting on \\"our mutual interest\\" in sports.)The full text of the letter reads: \\"Many thanks for sending the books you have written about outstanding athletes. Your thoughtfulness in recognizing our mutual interest is greatly appreciated.\\" Kennedy signed the letter \\"Bob.\\" Letter from U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to Gene Schoor, March 17, 1961. The letter may be viewed at . After describing his childhood enthusiasm for Schoor's work—typical of his generation of school children—best-selling sports author and sports-PR executive Marty Appel wrote, \\"Give [Schoor] the player’s year by year stats, throw in some good newspaper clips with some quotes about how the scout discovered him, create some locker room conversation between the star and his manager, sprinkle in some self-doubt after that .222 average in the first month of the rookie season, and bang, you had a 190-page book at $4.95 with a handful of some of the team’s best free publicity photos tucked in.\\" Journalist Jeff Kallman adds: \\"If you are my age, and you became a baseball fan early enough in childhood, you probably know the name Gene Schoor. He wrote a library's worth of sports biographies for children in the 1950s and early 1960s.... Schoor's technique ... involved mulcting as many newspaper and/or magazine articles as he could find about his subject, using the creamier quotes, making sure they included tales of how his subject was scouted, a quote or three in which our hero had his doubts, and as much rah- rah in the triumph as could be tolerated short of a need for Tums.... [T]he books were hits and they did give a lot of kids an entree into reading by way of their game.\\"\\"Lew Burdette, RIP,\\" by Jeff Kallman, at http://www.sports- central.org/sports/2007/02/14/lew_burdette_rip_the_fauna.php (accessed May 2011). According to Appel, one-time sports biographer Milton Shapiro wrote Appel and claimed to have been a ghost-writer for Schoor: \\"Shapiro says he was actually the writer of the biographies of Leo Durocher, Joe DiMaggio and Pee Wee Reese. And when he asked Schoor for more money and a co-author credit on [the biography of] Bob Feller, he was turned down and 'quit.'\\"\\"Harold Seymour,\\" by Marty Appel, Sports Collectors Digest, October 2001, available at http://www.appelpr.com/ARTICLES/A-Seymour.htm (accessed May 2011). (The chronology of Schoor's books suggests that Shapiro meant Bob Turley, not Bob Feller.)  Restaurant owner and boxing promoter  In 1959, Schoor and three others (former boxers Bill Nicholson, Sy Krieg, and Phil Krupin, whom Schoor met in Paris after they all served in World War Two) financed the New York City Second Avenue restaurant Johnny Johnston's Steakhouse.\\"Want Ad Brings in Boxers,\\" The Tuscaloosa News, December 27, 1962. Later, while interviewing President Kennedy, Schoor lamented the lack of opportunity given to American youth; Schoor claimed that the President replied, \\"We['ve] got millions of opportunities for kids. But they['ve] got to be shown, they['ve] got to be guided, they['ve] got to be helped. If you get the kids when they're young, why, hell, the kid walking down the street could be ... the next heavyweight champion of the world.\\" Inspired, Schoor's restaurant group formed Kid Galahad Boxers to invest in and nurture the careers of young, unknown boxers. To attract talent, in January 1962 they bought an ad in the New York Times which began: \\"$10,000 A YEAR WHILE YOU LEARN. A newly formed syndicate of sportsmen and businessmen is anxious to sponsor the next heavyweight champion. This group of sportsmen will underwrite all expenses of the chosen candidates and will pay a salary of $10,000 a year for the full training period. If you are between 19 and 25 years of age—if you weigh upwards of 186 pounds—if you are at least 6 feet tall—then you qualify for an interview.\\" Intrigued by the ad, the Times phoned Schoor. \\"I started to ad-lib right there,\\" Schoor recalled; at the time (as Sports Illustrated later put it), his group \\"had little more than an idea, a restaurant and a shoeshine.\\" Greatly exaggerating, Schoor told the Times he had \\"a syndicate and we've got $100,000.\\" The Times ran a long Sunday article about the subject, and \\"[t]he phones never stopped ringing for a week.... There were letters, phone calls, wires from all over the country, from Australia, Germany, every place. We were struggling to run a new restaurant, and we didn't know where the hell we'd get any kind of money. My partners said, 'Hey, what ... are we gonna do about all this?'\\" Without money, they did nothing. Three months later, however, \\"a wealthy New York construction man\\" offered to sponsor construction jobs at $158 a week (more than $1250 in 2017 dollars), which Schoor's group advertised as financial assistance to any suitable prospect \\"while he learns to be the next world champion.\\" Six men were hired for such jobs, while more than forty others were trained and promoted in professional bouts. The group's first major prospect (but at least fiftieth client) was James J. Beattie; at 6 feet 8 3/4 inches and 240 pounds, he was said at the time to be \\"the biggest boxer to ever enter the ring.\\" Beattie won his professional debut with a knockout only 24 seconds into the first round,Information in the above paragraphs collected from: \\"Want Ad Brings in Boxers,\\" The Tuscaloosa News, December 27, 1962. \\"Ring's Biggest Boxer on Saratoga Card,\\" Schenectady Gazette, August 1, 1963, p. 31. \\"Runs, Hits and Ears\\" (column), by Warren Koon, The [Charleston] News and Courier, February 21, 1963, p. 1D. \\"Boxer's Pro Debut Ends in Seconds,\\" The [Ventura] Press-Courier, May 29, 1963, p. 10. \\"The Pride Of Kid Galahad, Inc.\\" by Jack Olsen, Sports Illustrated, August 31, 1964. and went on to win 41 fights.BoxRec Boxing Records, at http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=17686&cat;=boxer (accessed May 2011).

Litigation  In 1960, Schoor sued former heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Marciano, claiming that Marciano had punched him during a dispute over Schoor's work as Marciano's ghost-writer. \\"I passed out,\\" Schoor alleged in his court complaint; \\"Bells have been ringing in my head ever since and I had a fuzzy feeling for weeks.\\" Although Marciano denied the claim, in April 1963 a New York court awarded Schoor $5000 damages (more than $30,000 in 2011 dollars). In 1975 Schoor was engaged in a dispute over the sale of letters from a young John Kennedy to his parents, which Schoor had used extensively in his work.\\"Ownership Issue Halts Sale of JFK Letters,\\" Boston Globe, August 10, 1975. In 1994, Schoor sued Kennedy biographer Nigel Hamilton and publisher Random House for $20 million, claiming that material in the defendants' best- selling book JFK: Reckless Youth had been appropriated, without payment or proper acknowledgment, from Schoor's research files (including extensive interview notes). Schoor was represented by \\"heavyweight lawyer\\" (the New York Times' phrase) Barry Slotnick.\\"Book Notes\\" (column), by Sarah Lyall, New York Times, May 12, 1994, Arts section.

Players who were signed by Bundesliga clubs, but only played in lower league, cup and/or European games, or did not play in any competitive games at all, are not included. Players of 2. Bundesliga clubs are also not included. #Are considered foreign, i.e., outside Germany determined by the following: ::A player is considered foreign if he is not eligible to play for the national team of Germany. More specifically, *If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used. These include German players with dual citizenship. *If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from German parents or moved to Germany at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation. Clubs listed are those for which the player has played at least one Bundesliga game--and seasons are those in which the player has played at least one Bundesliga game. Note that seasons, not calendar years, are used. For example, \\"1992–95\\" indicates that the player has played in every season from 1992–93 to 1994–95, but not necessarily every calendar year from 1992 to 1995. Therefore, a player should always have a listing under at least two years — for instance, a player making his debut in 2014, during the 2013–14 season, will have '2013–14' after his name. This follows general practice in expressing sporting seasons. Also please consider, that season specifications shall only be divided into more than one element, if a player has at least one season played no game in the Bundesliga. For example, a player plays in 2012–13 at club \\"A\\" and in 2013–14 at club \\"B\\", the correct season specification is \\"2012–14\\". This approach is used to keep the list more clear and readable. In bold: players who have played at least one Bundesliga game in the current season (2019–20), and are still at the clubs for which they have played. This does not include current players of a Bundesliga club who have not played a Bundesliga game in the current season.

As a contestant on the reality television show America's Next Great Restaurant, which aired in 2011, he created the concept for Soul Daddy (originally conceived of as W3, or Woods' Wings & Waffles), and was named the winner in the show's first-season finale on May 1, 2011. The restaurant chain opened on May 2, 2011, at three locations: at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, at Hollywood and Highland in Los Angeles, and at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan at 189 Front Street. The Manhattan and Los Angeles locations closed on June 14 and 15, 2011 in order for Woods to focus on making the Mall of America location successful, only for that location to close two weeks later on June 28. The restaurant was managed by ANGR Holdings, LLC (ANGR), a limited liability company. Chipotle Mexican Grill, purchased Ells' investment in the company at his cost, provided support for company operations and invested a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions, $220,000 of which was invested by Ells' in particular. The company also registered trademarks on several of the show's other restaurant concepts names: Harvest Sol, Spice Coast, Grill'Billies, Sinners and Saints, Revolution Tacos, Chǎo, and The Sports Wrap. History The New York City Soul Daddy was at the South Street Seaport, seen here on opening day, May 2, 2011. It closed slightly over a month later. Soul Daddy began as an idea by Jamawn Woods, a resident of Detroit, Michigan who, as a result of the poor economy, began serving chicken wings and waffles out of his home in order to support his wife and three children, as recounted in the series premiere of America's Next Great Restaurant, a reality television series on which Woods competed with other contestants to pitch restaurant concepts to investors Bobby Flay, Curtis Stone, Steve Ells and Lorena Garcia.\\"Pilot\\", America's Next Great Restaurant, NBC.com, March 6, 2011, accessed May 3, 2011. In the second episode, the other contestants unveiled their concept at Universal CityWalk, where Woods' restaurant was called W3's, or Woods Wings Waffles.\\"Episode 102\\", America's Next Great Restaurant, NBC.com, March 13, 2011, accessed May 3, 2011. In the third episode, a number of the contestants, including Woods, were advised to rethink their restaurant name, and devise a slogan or philosophy, along with a signature dish that represented their ideas, which would be voted on by a large group of customers. Woods unveiled his revised concept as \\"Soul Daddy\\", a soul food concept that bore the slogan \\"Cooking with Heart & Soul\\", and whose signature dish was collard greens with smoked turkey, grits accentuated with parmesan cheese and nutmeg, and loaded corn bread with sautéed onion, celery and bacon, which won him the most customer votes that week.\\"Episode 103\\", America's Next Great Restaurant, NBC.com, March 13, 2011, accessed May 3, 2011. By the fifth episode, Woods, who had downplayed the waffles from the dishes he had prepared in the previous episodes, re-introduced them to his menu on the advice of the investors.\\"Episode 105\\", America's Next Great Restaurant, NBC.com, March 13, 2011, accessed May 3, 2011. In the first-season finale, which aired on May 1, 2011, Woods beat his two fellow finalists, Joseph Galluzzi and Sundhir Kandula, who competed against him with meatball and modern Indian cuisine concepts, respectively. Bobby Flay, one of the four judges and investors, explained Woods' victory thus: \\"A passion for food, a solid work ethic, good business sense and delicious meals are what the investors were searching for on this series and Jamawn embodies all of those traits and more. He is truly the heart and soul of Soul Daddy. The investors are thrilled to introduce soul food to America through these restaurants and we are confident they will savor every flavor.\\" The restaurant's three inaugural locations, at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, at Hollywood and Highland in Los Angeles, and at 189 Front Street in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, opened on May 2, the day after the finale. Closure Woods, as part of his commitment to Soul Daddy, purchased a home in Lakeville, Minnesota in order to be close to the Mall of America restaurant while undertaking a year-long management training and modifying the menu to include items such as Hoppin' John (blackeyed peas and rice), corn on the cob, and warm yams to replace the potato salad, which was not met with positive reaction by patrons. In an effort to ensure the Minneapolis restaurant's continued success, the Manhattan and Los Angeles locations were closed on June 14, 2011. However, shortly after the restaurant's consolidation to a single market, ANGR Holdings, LLC announced on June 29 that they were closing the Bloomington, Minnesota location as well, likely signaling the end of the Soul Daddy franchise.

Early life and beginning of railroad career At age 16 in 1924, Rosenfeld had worked as a clerk and paralegal in a law firm. In October 1944, then 36 years old, she began her career as a railroad telegrapher and station agent with the Southern Pacific Railroad after completing courses in telegraphy and clerical work. The railroads began to hire increasing numbers of women during World War II to replace the men drafted into military service; Rosenfeld took the job to help support her growing family, then consisting of nine children. Employment as railroad operator – 1944–1955 After her divorce in 1953, she became the sole support of 6 of her 12 children and worked in a number of one-operator stations, mostly in desert areas around the Salton Sea from Mecca, California, to Yuma, Arizona. For a time, the family lived in a refrigerator car that Southern Pacific converted into housing with added screen porches. In 1955, a position opened in Saugus, California, for an agent/telegrapher. With ten years' seniority, Rosenfeld applied for the position. The Southern Pacific Railroad denied her promotion from operator to station agent, citing the state of California's \\"women's protective laws\\" which barred women from lifting more than 25 pounds or working more than eight hours per day, both of which were required of station agents. However, railroad workers were covered by the federal Railroad Labor Act, which did not distinguish between male and female workers. Rosenfeld then protested to her union, the Order of Railroad Telegraphers, noting that she had already performed the duties of a station agent in her previous employment, but earning a lower wage. However, the union did not support her claim. Suit against the State of California – 1968 The railroad continued to reject her claims for promotion, citing the California state law that barred women from performing the duties of station agents. However, In 1964, the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its Title VII made it illegal for employers to discriminate against women in hiring practices, and created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to redress employment grievances. When the Southern Pacific Railroad gave the position of agent/telegrapher at Thermal, California, to a man with less seniority in March 1966, she took her case to the EEOC, which advised her to file suit against the State of California. On August 30, 1968, she filed suit against the State of California, the Southern Pacific Railroad, and her union, then known as the Transportation Communications International Union. On November 25, 1968, the suit against the Southern Pacific Railroad was settled and the California women's protective laws were declared unconstitutional. A subsequent appeal filed by the railroad in 1971 was also decided in Rosenfeld's favor. The outcome of the suit was a victory for Rosenfeld, who received her promotion and pay increase, and benefited all women railroad workers. As a result, the railroad industry began hiring women in all positions in 1971 at the same pay rate as men. Later life and retirement Rosenfeld was able to receive her promotion and pay adjustment shortly before she retired from the Southern Pacific in 1974. She spent the rest of her life in Mariposa, California, where she was interviewed by railroad historian Shirley Burman and photographed by railroad photographer Richard Steinheimer in 1987. In her retirement, she helped to found the local animal shelter. She died in Mariposa in 2006.

In Amsterdam he had influenced the wealthy Abraham Pereyra to found a yeshiva in Hebron to be called Hesed le-Avraham, of which Meir himself became the head scholar.Yaari, Avraham. \\"Meir ben Ḥiyya Rofe.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 13. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 783-784. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 4 Dec. 2013. Meir was in Gaza in 1665 when Nathan of Gaza began to prophecy on the messianism of Sabbatai Zevi. In a subsequent letter to Amsterdam, to Abraham Pereyra, he wrote that \\"Nathan of Gaza is a wise man fit for the divine presence to rest upon him,\\" and urged Pereyra to come to Gaza. Pereyra reached Venice, but returned to Holland. Meir maintained his belief even after Sabbatai's conversion in 1666. In 1672 Meir left, again as an emissary of Hebron, for Turkey. He stayed for a time in Adrianople, where he was in contact with Sabbatai. On Sabbatai's exile to Albania in 1673, Meir returned to Gaza where he stayed with Nathan and even copied his writings for his own use. He then traveled again to Italy, and from 1675 to 1678 resided in the home of the Sabbatean Abraham Rovigo in Modena.Scholem, Gershom, Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah: 1626–1676, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1973, p. 887, states that Meir Rofe of Hebron had left Palestine together with Nathan of Gaza in 1666, and that he was \\"a member of Nathan's intimate circle in Adrianople...\\" Both Nathan and Abraham Rovigo were known Kabbalists, as was Rofe's father who studied Kabbalah with Hayyim Vital in Safed, where Rofe was born. Throughout his stay in Italy Meir did much to encourage those who believed in Sabbatai Zevi and spread the writings of Nathan of Gaza. During the last ten years of his life he was recognized as the outstanding scholar of Hebron. Meir Rofe persisted in his Sabbatean faith long after Sabbatai's apostasy, and even after Sabbatai's death.Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 888. Scholem also mentions in several places the correspondence about Sabbatean affairs he maintained with Abraham Rovigo between the years 1674 and 1678 as a very important source for the history of the Sabbatean movement.Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, p. 771. This correspondence was published by Isaiah Tishby in Sefunoth, III-IV (1960), pp. 71-130.

The album was recorded at the Record Plant in New York City in the fall of 1986 with the exception of two songs, \\"Return of the Leather Kings\\" and \\"Too Late To Run\\", which were recorded in May 1986 at Axis Sound Studio in Atlanta, Georgia. All songs were composed by band members with the exception of \\"Treat Her Like a Lady\\", a cover of the 1971 hit by the Cornelius Brothers and Sister Rose. The back cover artwork (created and designed by Zaremba ) displays a large image of a person's right hand with about 20 mystical symbols (a triangle, a rectangle, the symbol for infinity, the Astrological symbols for Taurus, Virgo, the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and Venus, and more) drawn on the palm of the hand in ink. Also highlighted in ink are the \\"life line\\" and \\"heart line\\"(from palm reading). Photos of the five band members appear where the five fingers should be, surrounded by handwriting identifying the band members and listing the instruments that they played on the album. The remaining liner notes are also hand written on the album cover at various orientations. A long humorous message to the reader occupying most of the left side of the album reads as follows: :Somebody had to do it! . . . and after waiting four years and studying the prophetic content of 'I'm gonna build me a Cave!' by John Lee Hooker, the FLESHTONES decided to do it themselves! The FLESHTONES are the FIVE ELEMENTS - combining to provide their 'special brand' of alchemy. . . passing the Philosopher's Stone over the discarded - transforming the discredited - rescuing and revivifying the bones rummaged from the musical glue factory. They reverse the rotting affects of reality, creating a world where a playboy (Horst Bucholst)(sic) helps a FBI agent find a kidnapped scientist (That Man in Istanbul). Our kind of world!!! But ask the mealy-mouthed, doesn't the FLESHTONES collective pitching arm ever tire of lobbing 'curve-balls' at boredom and pomposity? Can't anybody stop them? WHO WOULD WANT TO!!! Although internationally known as 'Nice Guys', the FLESHTONES henceforth operate on a SUPER-REVENGE MOTIF, ensuring 'Great Music' - and lots of laughs as their plans invariably explode in their faces. Do not attempt to recreate these stunts at home, merely purchase this LP and let these trained professionals get your kicks for you. GO AHEAD. IT'S ALRIGHT. This is NOT just a brittle snag to break the head-long plunge into the chasm of obscurity. NO - this is a 'rare opportunity' as well a 'standing invitation' from the FLESHTONES to step outside of time and claim the birthright they hold in trust for YOU! The FLESHTONES vs. Reality. . .

Quite possibly the monument of such type best-preserved of the entire peninsula. The tomb is located in an area with a high density of rural Roman remains, with several archaeological sites and Roman villas. Nearby have been located signs of other buildings of the same type. It is a construction of the 2nd century AD. The mausoleum had gone virtually unnoticed by scholars. It was not until 1874 that were officially reported to the administration (in this case, the Royal Academy of History) of its existence. The building was owned by various individuals, until in 1942 it was acquired by the State. Earlier, in 1931 had been declared historical artistic monument. Its state of conservation is enviable. Description Entablature decoration It is a rectangular building, of coated with sandstone, without mortar; the blocks are locked with metal parts. Is perfectly oriented along the cardinal points, with the main facade and entrance from east. Is a temple of classical type, the type known as prostyle, i.e. the facade consists of four columns: two between the side walls, and two attached to them. The blank walls are decorated with pilasters, two in the rear corners and two more in the middle of the side walls. On the walls and columns of the facade, of Tuscan order, stood the entablature decorated outside. This entablature had in its front an inscription, now lost, made of bronze letters nailed. Of these disappeared letters have remained only the signs of its existence in the stone. On the sides and rear, are reliefs with floral motifs and garlands. Above the entablature are placed two pediments, one at the front, badly damaged, but still retains the inscription, thanks to that has been identified in the building. The second pediment, in the back, is smooth and better preserved. Between the columns and the front gate, is the pronao. The interior cell is covered with a barrel vault. A stairs give access to the fourth burial beneath the building and also covered with a barrel vault. In the pediment is the inscription that can be easily read yet: L' A MILI LVPI It is assumed that between the A and M would be required to place an E. Above there traces of have contained nailed metal letters, easily a D and a M. As full registration might have been: D. M.

Schlafly is also credited with spearheading the movement towards satellite television within the industry. Schlafly was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 14, 1919. He often moved as a child as his father moved around as a wildcatter. He graduated from St. Louis University High School and later earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 1941. During the 1950s, Schlafly invented the teleprompter, which scrolls text to on-camera talent, in order to help a soap opera actor who could not remember his lines. Schlafly unveiled the teleprompter on the set of the CBS soap opera, The First Hundred Years, in 1950. Schlafly and Irving B. Kahn also co-founded the TelePrompTer Corporation, which grew to become the largest cable television provider in the United States by 1973. They later sold the company to Westinghouse. In addition to the teleprompter, Schlafly is also credited with helping to promote the broadcasting of television signals via a satellite feed. Schlafly and Sidney Topol, who worked for Scientific Atlanta, jointly constructed a portable satellite receiver to obtain satellite signals specifically for television. He first demonstrated the satellite television technology in 1973, when Speaker of the House Carl Albert was able to speak at a cable television convention in Anaheim, California, from his congressional office in Washington D.C. Schlafly later called the Albert speech via a satellite feed as his greatest contribution to the cable industry. In a 1956 article in Amazing Stories Magazine he predicted for the turn of the century: > Systematic information storage will be in a form instantly available for > response to remote inquiries. The refinements of solid state electronics > will permit devices of considerable complication to be packaged in amazingly > small volumes having low power requirements and exhibiting great resistance > to mechanical damage. Communications, both personal and group communications > will be highly refined without the encumbrance of any wires to or between > terminal devices.\\"The Cable Center Interview with \\"Hub\\" Schlarly In 2008, Schlafly was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame. His speech at the induction ceremony marked the first time that Schlafly used the teleprompter, which he had invented approximately fifty years before. Schlafly was also honored with two Emmy Awards for his contributions to cable television technology. Schlafly died at a hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, on April 20, 2011, at the age of 91. His wife, Leona Martin Schlafly, predeceased him in 2003 after fifty-nine years of marriage.

The station is best known for its morning news show La W, presented by Julio Sánchez Cristo, Alberto Casas Santamaría, and Camila Zuluaga.

FTTH deployment is increasingly a component of meeting universal service obligations, for example, the United Arab Emirates has not introduced a USO as all premises in the country have access to FTTH and are thus capable of very high connection speeds. Switzerland was the first country in the world to provide broadband universal service in January 2008, followed by Spain and Finland each guaranteeing 1Mbps. The UK followed by announcing a universal service obligation of 10Mbps in 2020 for every home in Britain. Taiwan started broadband universal service in 2007. The USA has proposed measures that would make broadband available to all citizens, but under pressure from telecommunications companies, has not implemented them. Background The term universal service was introduced in the early twentieth century. In many countries, such as the UK, United States, and Taiwan, voice telephony services have had subsidies for rural or poor customers. Although broadband has a technical meaning, in public policy discussions it means Internet access at higher rates than obsolete dial-up Internet access. Broadband overview Faster and more widely available broadband is considered an important opportunity to improve education, communication, and public participation in civic affairs. U.S. President Barack Obama mentioned: \\"one key to strengthening education, entrepreneurship, and innovation in communities… is to harness the full power of the Internet, and that means faster and more widely available broadband.\\" (Obama, 2009) The government claimed widespread broadband access is critical for global competitiveness, economic development, national security, public safety, job creation, civic engagement, etc.NTIA (2010). http://www.ntia.doc.gov/reports/2010/NTIA_internet_use_report_Feb2010.pdf Digital divide One of the main goals to have universal broadband service is to narrow the digital divide (\\"digital split\\"). Digital divide refers to \\"the differing amount of information between those who have access to the Internet (specially broadband access) and those who do not have access. The term became popular among concerned parties, such as scholars, policy makers, and advocacy groups, in the late 1990s.\\"Internet World Stats. http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm Digital divide is not just about the access to the Internet, but the quality of connection, and the related service availability. Implementation=Switzerland Switzerland was the first country in the world to provide broadband universal service with download/upload 600/100 kbps dataspeed to its citizens in January 2008, Finland In 2009, the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications announced a decree which required a 1Mb Internet connection to be included in universal service mandates in 2010. Therefore, Finland became the first country in the world to establish broadband universal service, albeit at a basic speed, as a general right of citizens. Spain Spain guarantees 1Mbps. United Kingdom In 2009, the UK announced a universal service commitment of 2Mbps in 2012 for every home in Britain. In 2015, the UK announced a universal service obligation of 10Mbps in 2020 for every home in Britain; however, as of January 2017 this had still to be ratified into an Act. Botswana right Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC) intends to deliver high Internet speed up to 50Mbps. It will be piloted in Gaborone, Francistown, Maun and would later be rolled out to other parts of the country by 2020.  Canada  In 2016, Canada announced a universal service obligation of 50Mbps by 2021.  Belgium  Belgium has a universal service obligation of 1000Mbps for 50% of the population by 2020.  Sweden  Sweden has set a target of 100Mbps for 95% of its population by 2020, and a USO of 1000Mbps to 98% of the population (100Mbps to the next 1.9% and 30Mbps to the final 0.1%) by 2025. Taiwan In 2012, the National Communications Commission (NCC) set up the goal to offer Internet access services with a speed of 12Mbps to every village in Taiwan to shorten the digital divide between urban and rural areas. This universal service mandate was supported by the Telecommunication Universal Service Fund. More than fifty remote villages which did not have broadband service are able to access broadband. In March 2018, the main technologies of broadband access network were ADSL and FTTH in Taiwan. The household coverage rate of ADSL, whose downlink connection speed is from 2 to 8Mbps, was approximately 98%, and around 97% in remote areas. Meanwhile, the coverage rate of FTTH of which speed is above 100Mbps was upwards of 90%, and 63% or so in remote areas. In response to integrated government policies and the demand for high-speed broadband by government departments and people, the Telecommunications Universal Service Fund Management Committee of the NCC approved in March 2019 to upgrade the broadband universal service from existing 12Mbps to 100Mbps in remote areas in the next four years (2020-2023). It is expected that the broadband coverage rate of 100Mbps or above in remote areas will be further increased to 70% after the completion of the implementation. In order to promote the development of broadband infrastructure and emerging applications, the Taiwanese government takes action to build infrastructure conducive to digital innovation contained in the \\"Digital Nation and Innovative Economic Development Plan (2017-2025)\\" (DIGI+ program). In light of Taiwanese 40.89% household coverage rate of Gigabit broadband at the end of 2017, it is expected to achieve 90% by 2020 so that township offices in remote areas can access it. Japan In Japan, based on the Telecommunications Business Law Article 7, telecommunications carriers that provide universal service must endeavor to provide that service in an appropriate, fair, and stable manner. These services include subscriber line access, public telephone service and emergency calls service. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is in charge of the Universal Service Fund in Japan.http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/presentation/pdf/071030_2.pdf United States of America Based on a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau in 2009 (N=50,000, unit: household), people with high incomes, those who are younger, more highly educated, Asians and Whites, and the employed, have higher rates of broadband use at home. People with low incomes, minorities, seniors, the less-educated, and the non-employed tend to have lower rates of broadband use at home. Besides, there are rural/urban differences as well. People in rural areas are less likely to adopt the Internet. NTIA2010 NTIA2010 According to NTIA (2011),NTIA (2011). http://www.ntia.doc.gov/reports/2011/NTIA_Internet_Use_Report_February_2011.pdf almost one-third of American households still lack a broadband connection. \\"The rates for White (68%) and Asian non-Hispanics (69%) exceed those for Black non-Hispanics (50%) and Hispanics (45%) by 18 percentage points or more. Rural America lags behind urban areas by ten percentage points (60% versus 70%).\\" Obama launched a policy campaign to counter nineteen state laws, which are currently preventing cities from investing in broadband Internet. According to U.S. News, the predicted effects of broadband investment is that it will increase Internet speeds and access, and give cities a competitive advantage. A research study done by the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration), showed that building new broadband infrastructure in communities increased broadband availability by around 2% more than cities that didn’t build new broadband infrastructures. Investing in broadband is also predicted to lead to an, \\"Increased economic output of as much as $21 billion annually,\\" according to NTIA. In order to \\"get people connected for basic communications that opens the door to economic and civic participation in cyberspace,\\"CFA & CA (Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union) (2009). Before the Federal Communications Commission: Report on rural broadband strategy. GN Docket No. 09-29. Retrieved from it is essential to provide basic broadband connectivity at an affordable prices. For years, the U.S. has endeavored to ensure its residents are connected to essential telecommunications. Following a 2008 release of broadband statistics by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which suggested that the U.S. may be lagging in broadband, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) requiring that the FCC draft a National Broadband Plan, and the FCC's efforts to ensure hard-to-serve areas and demographics are reached by communications technologies have focused on broadband. As U.S. President Obama mentioned, \\"this isn't just about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls. It's about connecting every part of America to the digital age. It’s about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world. It’s about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.\\" –President Obama, State of the Union Address, January 25, 2011. NTIA (2010) also pointed out, \\"universal access to and adoption of 21st Century broadband for all citizens is a top priority for the Obama Administration. Widespread access is critical to America’s future as the world’s economic leader because of its impact on increasing our productivity, global competitiveness, and improving Americans’ quality of life – through economic growth and development, job creation, national security, telemedicine, distance learning, public safety, civic engagement, and telework.\\" =Necessity of broadband= According to NTIA (2010), the major reason for people not having high speed Internet use at home is \\"don’t need/not interested\\" (37.8%), and the second one is \\"too expensive\\" (26.3%). Some therefore argue the government should not be paying for a service people do not want. NTIA2010 =Government intervention= Some people argue that universal service policies may not be the best way to increase broadband penetration. If the regulators could increase incentives to ensure operators offer such services, the market instead of government mandates might lead to universally available broadband service. Maybe there are other steps can be taken to design the service and tariff packages without subsidies to ensure broadband penetration.Garnham, N. (1998). Universal service. Journal of Economic Issues. pp. 199-204. =Funding system= One of the biggest concerns regarding universal broadband service is \\"how to use the universal service funding efficiently and effectively.\\" How could the regulator ensure the cost proposed by the operators is true and reasonable? In the National Broadband Plan, the FCC planned to eliminate the rate-of-return regulation in the Universal Service Fund (USF). This may result in the uncertainty of profits to ILECs and decrease their incentives to provide broadband universal service.http://tw.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A8tUwYRScshNFBYA2Vtr1gt.;_ylu=X3oDMTE2czFxZzB1BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMgRjb2xvA3R3MQR2dGlkA1NNRVRXMDdfMzYw/SIG=12e1kvtgp/EXP=1305010898/**http%3a//www.opastco.org/doclibrary/1963/030910NBPLetter.pdf In the United States, the notion of universal service was initially advocated by Theodore Vail, the vice president of AT&T;, who proposed a policy based on \\"one system, one policy, universal service.\\" Universal service mainly refers to \\"Government policies to promote the affordability of telephone service and access to the network.\\"Mueller, Jr., M. L. (1997). Universal service: A concept in search of a history. In Universal Service: Competition, Interconnection, and Monopoly in the Making of the American Telephone System. Universal service advocates say ubiquitous communications infrastructures can enhance national unity and equality of opportunity. Therefore, it could be a way to express \\"liberal egalitarianism.\\"Mueller, Jr., M. L. (1997). Universal service: A concept in search of a history. In Universal Service: Competition, Interconnection, and Monopoly in the Making of the American Telephone System The Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promote all citizens be able to access advanced telecommunication services at a reasonable price. These services mainly included voice telephony services, both the fixed lines and wireless phones. FCC The goals of universal Service, as mandated by the 1996 Act, were to:http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/universal_service/ FCC * Promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates for all consumers * Increase nationwide access to advanced telecommunications services * Advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas * Increase access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities * Provide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs In 2010, the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service agreed that universal service programs need to support broadband service. In February 2011, President Obama announced the Wireless Innovation and Infrastructure Initiative. =National Broadband Plan= In the US, the broadband universal service concept is rooted in the universal service mandate in Telecommunications Act of 1996.TeleCommunity (2011). http://telecommunityalliance.org/issues/broadbanduniservice.html Arguments regarding the National Broadband Plan are also related to broadband universal service debates. The US National Broadband Plan was released by the FCC in March 2010. The agency started the process of creating this plan in April 2009. After holding thirty-six public workshops and streamed online, with more than 10,000 people and 700 parties participated, 23,000 comments were generated. The FCC filed about 13,000 pages and held nine public hearings to refine and clarify the plan and proposed it in 2010. The plan mentions many potential policies. For example, the federal government intended to make 500 MHz of spectrum available to promote wireless broadband. It proposed the \\"Connect America Fund (CAF) to support the provision of affordable broadband and voice with at least 4 Mbps actual download speeds and shift up to $15.5 billion over the next decade from the existing Universal Service Fund (USF) program to support broadband\\". =National Broadband Map= The National Broadband Map was created by the NTIA and FCC. It was launched on February 17, 2011. It is a searchable database of information on high-speed Internet access. Although the map was in an early stage of development and contained errors, by entering specific addresses, users can acquire information on how connected their communities are. On the website of the National Broadband Map, broadband providers are listed in order of their maximum speed advertised.FCC (2011). National Broadband Map. http://www.broadband.gov/maps/ =Universal Service Fund Reforms and Connect America Fund= On April 21, 2010, the US FCC launched a notice of inquiry (NOI) and notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for what it called the \\"once-in-a-generation transformation\\" of the Universal Service Fund (USF). According to the National Broadband Plan, the FCC planned to make 4 megabits per second download speeds and 1 Mbit/s upload speed available to all Americans by 2020. To support this, two funds will be created: the Connect America Fund (CAF) and the Mobility Fund. The CAF will replace high cost programs in the USF but will only provide funds to areas where there is no private operator willing to provide broadband service for a lack of profitability. The Mobility Fund will mainly focus on the wireless Internet access. There are three stages in the plan. The first stage aims to set up the overall policymaking apparatus. In this stage, the Universal Service Fund transforms from telephone service support to broadband service support. The Connect American Fund and the Mobility Fund will be created in the first stage. In the second stage, scheduled for 2012–2016, these two new funds will distribute the funds they have collected. Broadband services will be taxed to support the funds. In the third stage, scheduled in 2017–2020, the USF will be discontinued. In February 2011, the FCC adopted an NPRM and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) to ask for comments on reforming the Universal Service Fund and the Commission’s intercarrier compensation (ICC). The FCC planned workshops to discuss the reforms. The first workshop was held on February 17, 2011.http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2011/db0210/FCC-11J-1A1.doc The second workshop was held on April 27, 2011 and the main theme was related to the implementation of a Phase I of the Connect America Fund (CAF), including the costs and capabilities of broadband technologies and the use of the funds in Phase I of the CAF. On October 27, 2011, the FCC adopted its \\"Connect America Fund & Intercarrier Compensation Reform Order\\" which established a $4.5 billion Connect America Fund to expand broadband access to seven million unserved rural Americans, replacing the Universal Service Fund's high-cost support and explicitly endorsing broadband as a universal service.\\"Connect America Fund Executive Summary\\" , 2011-10-27. Retrieved on 2011-10-28. The Connect America Fund also includes $500 million for mobile broadband, of which $100 million is set aside for mobile broadband on tribal lands. On November 9, 2011, the Connect-to-Compete program was announced. Businesses and non-profit groups will work together to provide broadband access for low-income people in the United States. 35 million households, about one-third of the total, many of them poor, do not have the service. Persons without broadband have a harder time finding jobs using the Internet. By Summer 2012, homes in which children qualify for the federal school lunch program will become eligible for $9.95 broadband service. Also as part of the program, Microsoft will also sell PCs with Office Suite for $250. =State efforts= In Massachusetts, an ARRA grant was supplemented with state funds in 2010 for the Massachusetts Broadband Institute to extend broadband access to the entire state. =COVID-19= As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to broadband Internet became important for work, education and other purposes when people had to shelter in place. But 28 percent of Americans either could not get it or could not afford it. The number was 23 percent in cities.

She founded the Colegio del Sagrado Corazon de Jesus, a charity school for poor children that has evolved into what is now Sacred Heart College in Lucena City. Early life Hermana Fausta Labrador was born on December 19, 1858 in Tayabas, Quezon, to Policarpio Labrador and Nemesia Zarzadias. On December 22, 1858 she was baptized in St. Archangel church, Tayabas. On December 2, 1866 her mother died at age 27. Father had a second marriage to Maria Poblete. She has half-sisters Fe and Felisa. She started schooling in 1869. In 1879 she studied in Colegio de Santa Rosa de Manila. Religious life Fr. Granja visited them in the new house and counselled them to live in harmony. He gave Fausta \\"guidelines\\" regarding the house. Call all members of the new household, admonish them to live in the harmony. He imparted his paternal blessing with these words: \\"May the peace reign in this house.\\" They all went to Church except the old Juan. From this day on the Rule of Life was: Hermana to get up at 3 AM everyday; her companions at 4 AM to pray together the Rosary and Trisagion. Afterwards companions remain to tidy the house. Hermana goes immediately to the church. Her companions follow her when the church bells ring for mass. Together they leave the church for breakfast. After which each to its respective chores while Hermana and Flaviana remain in the house.

Daily Work of Hermana Fausta : Teach in a loud voice: \\"Every night Hermana Tomasa, Cesarea and Escolastica come to this house followed by Fr. Granja who explains what we have taught our charges during the day. Many, although already well prepared, do not like to leave and they remain in this house.\\" Death and Veneration Hermana Fausta Labrador died on 14 September 1942, on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. Her beatification proceedings for her cause are now undertaken by the Diocese of Lucena with the full support of the Daughters of Charity and Sacred Heart College. City Ordinance No.2377 Lucena City Declares Hermana Fausta Labrador as \\"Ina ng Lucena\\" From the book The Good Woman of Lucena to the indie film “Fausta” to the coffee table book “Witnessing to a Glorious Heritage”, everything seem to have come into its own place and perspective, leading to another magnificent act – Lucena City Ordinance No. 2377 Series of 2009 entitled “An Ordinance Declaring Hermana Fausta Labrador y Zarzadias as One of the Local Heroes of Lucena City and shall be called “INA NG LUCENA.” Initiated by the school through its President Sr. Fe G. Gedalanga, D.C. and with the help of its SHC alumnus and long time college professor Councilor Wilfredo Asilo, the City Ordinance No. 2377 was unanimously enacted by the 12 Councilors and Vice Mayor Philip M. Castillo on December 7 and approved by Mayor Ramon Y. Talaga, Jr. on December 14. Before the approval of the city ordinance, a well attended public forum was held on December 4. The audience was able to know the life story of Hermana Fausta and her contributions to Lucena by watching the movie “Fausta” and by listening to the accounts of various resource speakers who have had personal encounters with Hermana Fausta, experiences as alumni or as parents of students in SHC, like Mr. Juanito T. Martinez who was the founder of SHC's Parent Faculty Council in the college department, and knowledge on the history of Lucena. A video of Dr. Cesar A. Villariba, a known historian of Lucena City and Quezon Province, was shown wherein he mentioned that among the famous and important women of Lucena, Hermana Fausta is truly a remarkable one. In addition, Dr. Rebecca V. de Ocampo, a former superintendent of Lucena City and Marinduque and now president of Girl Scouts of the Philippines-Quezon Council, expressed her belief that Hermana Fausta could be the model that youth of today is clamoring for. Then Purificacion Jawili, or Tita Puring, shared her fond memories of Hermana Fausta while she was still a young child. “Ang diwa ni Hermana Fausta… ang pagtulong sa kapwa ay dumadaloy” said Tita Puring recalling how “banal” Lola Uta was. With all the statements attesting to life and works of Hermana Fausta, the principal author Councilor Asilo, together with the co-authors Councilor Felix F. Avillo and Councilor Clarinda S. Cabana, went for these additional provisions: December 19, being the date of birth, be celebrated in Lucena City as “Hermana Fausta Day” with its celebration spearheaded by the Alumni of Sacred Heart College; a monument in honor of Hermana Fausta be erected in a conspicuous place in the city with the help of the City Government which shall be financed by the administration of SHC; and the National Historical Commission be notified of the declaration through the ordinance. Inspiring and historical, she truly holds a special place in the hearts of the students, the Cordians, and all the city people. Yes, that is Hermana Fausta, “Ina ng Lucena”, the hero.

It uses the traditional Manchu staple foods of millet, broomcorn millet, soybean, peas, corn and broomcorn. It relies heavily on preserved foods (often pickling) due to the harsh winters and scorching summers in Northeast China. Manchu cuisine is also known for grilling, wild meat, strong flavours and the wide use of soy sauce. Manchu cuisine is more wheat based than Han Chinese cuisines. History The ancestors of the Manchus were the Jurchen and Mohe people. The Mohe enjoyed eating pork, practised pig farming extensively, and were mainly sedentary, and also used both pig and dog skins for coats. They were predominantly farmers who grew soybean, wheat, millet and rice, in addition to engaging in hunting. In contrast with their Mohe ancestors, the Jurchens developed respect for dogs around the time of the Ming dynasty and passed this tradition to their Manchu descendants. In Jurchen culture, it was forbidden to use dog skin and harm, kill or eat dogs. The Jurchens also believed that the Koreans' use of dog skin was an \\"utmost evil\\". The Koreans' consumption of dog meat set them apart from the Manchus. The Manchu Han Imperial Feast () includes many notable dishes in Manchu cuisine. This banquet combined the best cuisine from the Manchus, Han Chinese, Mongols, Hui people and Tibetans. It included 108 dishes (of which 54 are northern dishes and 54 are southern dishes) that would be eaten over three days. The Manchu palace banquets were subdivided into six grades. The first, second and third grades were prepared for deceased imperial ancestors. The fourth grade food was served to the imperial family during the Lunar New Year and other festivals. The fifth and sixth grades were served on all other occasions. Notable dishes in Manchu cuisine The typical Manchu dishes include pickled vegetables. Manchurian hot pot () is a traditional dish, made with pickled Chinese cabbage, pork and mutton. Bairou xuechang () is a soup with pork and blood sausage and pickled Chinese cabbage. Suziyie doubao () is a steamed bun, stuffed with sweetened, mashed beans and wrapped with perilla leaves outside. Sachima is a candied fritter similar to Tatar Çäkçäk, which is a very popular sweet. Other common dishes are: suancai cuan bairou (; sour vegetables with boiled meat), suan tangzi (; a sour soup with fermented corn flour), di san xian (stir-fried eggplant, potato and green pepper), Manchu sausage, ludagun (a steamed roll made of bean flour), and niushe bing (; a type of cake).

Film In production before America entered World War II, the film was completed several weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, having gone through frantic last minute updates to ensure it meeting its February 1942 release date. Joris Ivens anticipated that editing might take a week, but stated that Hollywood \\"fiddled with it for two months and unrecognizably altered the original version.\\" Walter Huston narrates a World War II documentary intended to bolster United States support for the USSR's war efforts.

Upon release, the film screened for more than 20 hours a day and broke all previous box office records at the Rialto Theater in Times Square. Reception The New York Times reports that \\"the greatest battle in history\\" was assembled by Lewis Milestone and Joris Ivens into a \\"tersely contemporary document\\". They note that it did not rank favorably when compared to \\"great documentaries\\" because its commentary was uninspired, and it attempted to crowd too much within a timeframe of 40 minutes, resulting in it being only \\"a synoptic account of the Russian war effort\\". They granted that as a record of the Russian people's struggle, \\"it is a heartening account,\\" and communicated the \\"urgency of this urgent moment.\\" The reviewer noted that the film was a picture of total war, from the bayonets and shells of the front lines, to the efforts of the peasants and laborers and scientists struggling to support the war effort, sharing that in such circumstances, there are \\"no 'noncombatants' in this war.\\" In Russians in Hollywood, Hollywood's Russians: biography of an image, author Harlow Robinson writes that of the several pro-Soviet documentaries made in Hollywood, the most important were Our Russian Front, directed in 1942 by Lewis Milestone for Artkino Pictures and the Russia Relief Organization, and The Battle of Russia, directed in 1943 by Anatole Litvak and Frank Capra as part of the Why We Fight series.

Eventually Krusen changed his major and schools, graduating from New York University (BFA, Film and Television) in 1976. He promptly started working with Tele-Tactics, a small production company making commercials and industrial films; other work in the New York film industry followed for several years, culminating in experience at both directing and producing. Career In the 1980s, Krusen founded Messenger Films as an outgrowth of his work on Spanish-language productions for U.S.-based relief agencies and international Christian ministries. He produced his first dramatic film, Ropa Nueva para Felipe (New Clothes for Felipe), under the new Messenger Films banner. In 1989 Krusen earned his MFA at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California and has steadily produced and directed films since. He is also an author and has written the books Undaunted for Tyndale Momentum and They Were Christians (Baker Books).
