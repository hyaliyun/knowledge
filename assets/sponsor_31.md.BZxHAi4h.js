The primary languages spoken are Guarani and Tupi-Guarani.  History  Aldeia Ita√≥ca was founded in 1970 by the Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio (FUNAI) in an effort to halt the socio-cultural disintegration that was taking place among the Gurani-Tupi-Guarani in Brazil. Aldeia Ita√≥ca is approximately three miles from the southern coast of the state of S√£o Paulo and connected with the neighboring Guarani village of Aldeia Aguapeu (also part of Mongagu√°) via the Aguapeu River. The two indigenous villages in Mongagu√°: Ita√≥ca and Aguape√∫, located in an Atlantic Forest environmental reserve. The indigenous community of Aguape√∫ conceived the project \\"Jaguatare√≠ Nhembo√©\\" Caminhando e Aprendendo \\", which aims at recognizing and valuing the Guarani identity and the environment of this indigenous people: the Atlantic Forest biome. Aldeia Ita√≥ca is also just seven miles from another Guarani settlement called Aldeia Rio Branco located within the municipality of Itanha√©m. Mongagu√°'s history goes back to the time of Brazil's colonization, when the city belonged for many years to the municipality of S√£o Vicente - the first village founded in Brazil, by the Portuguese navigator Martim Afonso de Sousa (1500-1564). In 1624, Mongagu√° became part of the Itanha√©m township.  Demographics  In June 2016, Aldeia Itaoca had 127 inhabitants, of whom 78 were Guarani and 49 were Tupi-Guarani. However in 2020 there was just 90 total registered dwellers.https://terrasindigenas.org.br/pt-br/terras-indigenas/4074 Flora and Fauna As Aldeia Ita√≥ca is an ecologically protected area, literally located within the Serra do Mar national park of the Mata Atlantica (Atlantic Forest), it is rich in flora and fauna containing many endemic species. Tree species in the area include Cariniana legalis, Breja√∫va Palms, etc, while animal species in Aldeia Ita√≥ca's 2 square kilometer region include; the Yellow-legged thrush (Turdus flavipes) and Smooth-horned Frog Proceratophrys Miranda-Ribeiro). Notable Resident (Danilo Benites) Activist and former Chief of Aldeia Ita√≥ca, Danilo Benites (or Vera) has been instrumental in protecting the rights of Guarani people through his annual statewide event Encontro de Jovens Lideran√ßas Guarani do Estado de S√£o Paulo (or Meeting of Young Guarani Leaders of the State of S√£o Paulo). The first edition of the event, in 2017, brought together 60 young people from villages in the State of S√£o Paulo. ‚ÄúNow we get 100 young people from 24 villages in Brazil. There are also people from Rio de Janeiro, Paran√°, Santa Catarina, I am proud to make this meeting grow. Because despite the name of the meeting saying ‚ÄòState of S√£o Paulo‚Äô, the Guarani people have no borders, ‚Äùsays Danilo Benites. ‚ÄúThe white man, he has the Constitution, where our rights are. But he does not respect what is on paper, so we need to teach the young people who are there to defend our struggle, so we need to teach the young people who are there to defend our struggle ‚Äù. For Benites, the biggest challenge is to be able to bring young people into the discussion and teach them how to use the available tools, such as social networks, in favor of the fight. ‚ÄúThe rulers, ruralists, non-indigenous people, allege 'the use of technology' against us, to say that we are no longer Indians. So we have to teach young people to use this technology in favor of our struggle ‚Äù. Between one table and another, the young man was in charge of introducing the leaders and guests, in Portuguese and Guarani, in addition to encouraging the participation of everyone in the audience. ‚ÄúI have always participated in political discussions, in the events of the elderly. But listening. Because I only learned Portuguese when I was 16 years old. Then I was able to get more involved and fight more for our causes ‚Äù.

She taught in the Palo Alto Public schools from 1961 to 1969 and then assisted in running the school during the Occupation of Alcatraz. From the early 1970s, she began to teach at the university level, teaching art at San Francisco State College, the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, and California State University, Fresno. Throughout her life, she was active in women's organizations and organizations focused on indigenous people. Posthumously, her service was honored with an induction into Stanford's Multicultural Alumni Hall of Fame in 1995. Early life and education Anne Woesha Cloud was born on September 7, 1918 in Wichita, Kansas to Elizabeth Georgiana (n√©e Bender) and Henry Roe Cloud. On her father's side, Cloud was Ho-Chunk and on her mother's, Ojibwe. Her father was a teacher who founded the American Indian Institute of Wichita, and later was the superintendent of the Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas. Her mother was a teacher and taught at the Institute, managed the finances, acted as matron, and advised on the school administration. Cloud was the couple's second daughter, and she had an older sister, Elizabeth Marion (born 1917), and three younger siblings, Lillian Alberta (born 1920), Ramona Clark (born 1922) and Henry Jr. (1926‚Äì1929). When her brother died, they adopted Jay Hunter, according to Ho-Chunk custom. Her parents were strong advocates of higher education and Cloud obtained an undergraduate degree from Vassar College in 1940. Career After her graduation, Cloud worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, teaching as an apprentice at the Phoenix Indian School, before being sent to teach as an arts and crafts instructor on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. After teaching for two years, Cloud married a non-Native, Robert Carver North on August 14, 1943 in Walterboro, South Carolina. Robert served in the U.S. Army during World War II and participated in the Battle of Saipan. While he was away, North completed a master's degree in painting and fine arts under L. C. Mitchell at Ohio University in 1944 and then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. By the late 1940s they had moved to California and both were studying at Stanford University. Robert became a professor at Stanford and North devoted time to raising their five children. Her daughter, Renya K. Ramirez, is an anthropologist and author. North became a regular exhibitor of art in the San Francisco Bay Area and when her children were old enough, she returned to teaching. In 1961, she became an art teacher for the Palo Alto public school system. On December 2, 1969, Cloud went to Alcatraz Island to participate in the events unfolding there among Native American people. Just over a week later, when the All Tribes Elementary School was founded, she began teaching at the experimental school. Along with traditional reading and math courses, students were given classes in Native culture. During the week, North remained on the island but on weekends returned to care for her family. In May 1970, she returned home, but continued commuting to the island two days a week to teach art classes, until the government forced the remaining American Indians to abandon the occupation in June 1971. In the fall of 1970, North joined in the founding of the National Indian Women's Action Corps, an empowerment organization for Native American women. The organizing officers included Dorothy Lonewolf Miller (Blackfoot), president; Grace Thorpe (Sac & Fox), vice president; Stella Leach (Colville-Oglala Lakota), 2nd vice president; North, secretary; Henrietta Whiteman (Cheyenne), treasurer; and Jennie R. Joe (Navajo), sergeant-at-arms. She was also a founder of the American Indian and Alaska Native Caucus for the American Public Health Association. In the early 1970s, she began teaching at San Francisco State College and completed a second master's degree at Stanford in 1972, in art education. In 1975, she and Robert divorced, and North moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. She graduated with her PhD in educational history and philosophy in 1978 from the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln and then taught in the ethnic studies department at Lincoln. When she was not teaching, she produced and exhibited art works. She participated in exhibits in the Bay Area and at the Heard Museum from 1966 to 1975. Her work was also shown in 1975 in Sacramento for the Governor's Minority Art Native American Exhibit. In 1983, her paintings were featured in the exhibit, Recent Paintings by North and Yazzie, hosted by the U. S. Department of the Interior at the Sioux Indian Museum in Rapid City, South Dakota. Her painting style originally was realistic, but later works used symbolism, cubism, and impressionism to depict family as a part of the greater universe, blending in images of traditional Native elements. In 1984, she returned to the west coast to be near her daughters. She moved to Fresno and taught at California State University until her retirement.

He published a number of ethnographic and architectural essays on the Rif region.  Biography  Born on 15 March 1892 in Ordu√±a, Biscay, he licentiated from the Infantry Academy in 1913. He was destined to Larache, in the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco in 1914. A military colonial comptroller in the Spanish protectorate of Morocco from 1927 to 1945, he served as delegate for Native Affairs from 1944 to 1945. Ascribed to Africanism, according to Alfonso Iglesias Amor√≠n, Blanco fitted better a profile in the vein of the 19th-century Spanish africanists, underpinned by a greater respect for the local population, a greater awareness of the social and cultural fabric of the Protectorate, and a preference for peaceful solutions rather than the africanomilitarismo subset embodied by the likes of Francisco Franco, Jos√© Sanjurjo, Emilio Mola, Jos√© Mill√°n-Astray and Juan Yag√ºe, characterised for vying for a rapid military promotion, a lesser cultural acumen and for espousing anti-democratic views. A Berberophile, he was weary of the Arab and French influences on the Berbers, rejecting both Western and Arab influences in the architecture of the region. Striving towards finding an ideal style from the Riffians, he projected a number of small buildings in the protectorate based on a mashup of ksar from Southern Morocco, Neo-Pharaonic egyptian architecture and Pre-Columbian models. A keen researcher of the Riffian customary law, he praised the perks of keeping the local assemblies in force, opposed to the influence dictated by the Makhzen; he got to the point of stating \\"what is ridiculous (on the Part of the Spanish colonial administration) is not having protected the Rif from Sharia contamination\\". He died in 1949 in Madrid. has described him as \\"probably the most relevant Spanish rife√±ista from the 20th century\\".

Its construction was expected to take five years, but because of extreme geological conditions along its alignment, completion took place on 28 April 2020, after 12 years of construction.

The strike, led by the International Woodworkers of America (IWA), concerned loggers who campaigned for improved labor and living conditions in logging camps. The strike was unsuccessful and resulted in the IWA being de-facto expelled from Newfoundland. The strike has been described as the \\"most bitter labour dispute in Newfoundland‚Äôs history.\\"  History  A major exported of lumber and lumber products, Newfoundland was a center for the Canadian lumber industry. By the 1950's, the industry was employing thousands of Newfoundlanders. One of the larger lumber companies on Newfoundland was the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. (AND Co.), which employed hundreds of lumberjacks. The local labor union, the Newfoundland Loggers' Association (NLA), was considered by some to be too weak to deal with the company. In 1956, the International Woodworkers of America (IWA) began to operate on Newfoundland, quickly challenging the NLA for control over the organized labor movement on the island. To lower public support for the NLA, the IWA began to poach membership from the NLA and proclaim that the latter was an overly weak union, resulting in friction between the two competing organizations. Tensions continued to mount, and in 1958 the IWA organized a large strike at an AND Co. facility in Grand Falls-Windsor, advocating for higher wages and better working conditions. When the strike began on 31 December 1958, hundreds of workers joined the strike. Many workers supported the IWA but a number of lumberjacks remained in support of the NLA, which strongly opposed the strike, believing the IWA to be radicals. The IWA retaliated by stepping up activities and publishing articles attacking the NLA and AND Co. in local newspapers. The strike continued for several weeks without major incident, but by February public sentiment had turned against the strikers and the IWA. A notable opponent was Joey Smallwood, an influential politician who threatened to strip the IWA of their bargaining rights. Public opinion of the strike fell further when a policeman was killed in a confrontation (known as the Badger riot) with strikers in March. Bolstered by public support, the Newfoundland government passed a number of laws stripping the IWA of its right to bargain while also making labor unions liable for illegal acts committed on their behalf.

From 1882 to 1921 all of Ireland was represented by a single side, the Ireland national football team, organised by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1920 Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. In 1922, The south of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, later to become Republic of Ireland. Amid these political upheavals, a rival football association, the Football Association of Ireland (the F.A.I.), emerged in Dublin in 1921 and organised a separate league and later a national team. In 1923, during a period when the home nations had dis-affiliated from the governing body, Google books the FAI was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State on the condition that it changed its name to the Football Association of the Irish Free State. At the same time, the IFA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis, regularly calling up Free State players. During this era at least one Northerner, Harry Chatton, also played for the Irish Free State and from 1936, the FAI began to organise their own all‚ÄìIreland team. Both teams now competed as Ireland and during this era at least 39 dual internationals were selected to represent both teams.

After its third formation, it served during the American Revolutionary War/Anglo-French War, and later the French Revolutionary Wars until amalgamating with two volunteer battalions to form a new demi-brigade. The regiment's successor, the 24√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie would serve in the modern French Army until 1997 when it was disbanded following the end of the Cold War. It was then reformed as the Bataillon de R√©serve √éle-de-France, and forms part of the Commandement de la Logistique or Logistics Command as the only fully reserve unit of the French Army.  First Formation (1649)  On 10 February 1649 the R√©giment de Brie was formed under N. de Jouy but disbanded the next year on 20 January 1650. The regiment was raised, but doesn't seem to have served in the Franco-Spanish War (1635‚Äì1659).Susane, Volume VIII, pp, 183, 232‚Äì234.  Second Formation (1684)  Engraving of the Battle of Friedlingen  Reunions & Nine Years' War  On 18 September 1684 from companies of the R√©giment de Picardie, Colonel Armand de B√©thune, Marquis de Charost raised the R√©giment de Brie for service in the War of the Reunions. The regiment joined the garrison of Calais in 1687 and took part the next year in the Conquest of the Palatinate during the Nine Years' War. On 19 July 1690, the Marquis of Charost retired and replaced by the Marquis of Raffetot. The regiment then served in the Rhineland until 1693, and the Army of Italy from 1694 to 1696, then the Army of the Meuse in 1697.  Spanish Succession  In 1702, as the War of the Spanish Succession was declared, the regiment took part in the Battle of Friedlingen, and later the Siege of Neuf-Brisach, Siege of Landau, and the Battle of Speyerbach in 1703. In 1704 it transferred to the Army of the Alps and took part in the Siege of Nice in 1705, and the Siege of Turin in 1706. Then, in 1707 took part in the Siege of Toulon, and the next year transferred back to the Army of the Rhine, where it would remain until 1713. In 1709 the regiment transferred to the command of the song of the previous colonel, N. de Raffetot, and the regimental title remained. In 1726 the regiment's colonel again changed, and placed under the Count of La Marche, and the regimental title became the R√©giment du Comte de La Marche while Lieutenant Colonel Guillaume, Marquis de Bellai de La Courbe stood in for a short time as de facto commanding officer until the Colonel came of age.  Polish & Austrian Successions  As part of the wider re-organisation of the army in 1727, the regiment gained its permenant title named after its respective province to become the R√©giment de Brie. In 1733 as the War of the Polish Succession started, the regiment joined the Army of the Rhine and the next year took part in the Siege of Philippsburg. In 1735 the regiment fought at the Battle of Klausen and in 1739 the Count of Ag√©nois took over as the new colonel. Engraving of the Battle of Saint Cast, showing the large French force holding off the English invaders. In 1742 as the War of the Austrian Succession started. the regiment joined the Army of Bavaria under Maurice, Comte de Saxe (Saxony) and took part in the relief of Braunau. In 1743 they participated in the Defence of Egenfeld, and the next year moved back to the Rhine, and in 1744 joined the Army of the Alps where the colonel was seriously wounded during the Battle of Ch√¢teau Dauphin. During the Defense of Asti, the regiment were taken as prisoners of war on 4 March 1746. In June 1747 the regiment was exchanged and recovered their numbers in La Seyne-sur-Mer, moved to Genoa, and remained there until the peace. On 1 January 1748 the Chevalier of Polignac took over as colonel.  Seven Years' War  During the majority of the Seven Years' War, the regiment remained on coastal defence duties in Brittany. In 1758 it took part in the Battle of Saint Cast and the colonel was mortally wounded there, and replaced by the Marquis of Coislin, the final colonel of the regiment. Finally, on 25 November 1762 following the large-scale reduction of the active force, the regiment was disbanded and its traditions and lineage ended. During the second formation of the regiment, the ordnance flag was of five ordnance sections with red and a diagonal yellow bar in each square. The uniform was a white coat and breeches, red collar, facings, and jacket, small yellow buttons, long pockets with nine three-by-three goose feet buttons, three buttons on the sleeves, and the black tricorne edged in gold.  Third Formation (1775)  In 1775, King Louis XVI published the Ordnnance du Roi, concernant l'infanterie Fran√ßaise du 16 Avril 1775, which announced the splitting of seven four battalion regiments into 14 two battalion regiments, 7 of those new. These new regiments would be granted the number of precedence immediately after their predecessor, and their uniform similar until a new ordnance is published. Another one of the major changes was the establishment of a uniform structure of battalions which consisted of; a company of grenadiers (senior company, on the far right of the line), 8 companies of fusiliers, and an independent company of chasseurs assigned to battalion headquarters (placed on the far left).Ordonnance du Roi, Concernant l'Infanterie Fran√ßais du 26 Avril 1775 de Par le Roi.Susane, Volume I, pp, 306‚Äì307, 310, 314, 342. One of the new regiments formed as a result of this ordnance was the R√©giment de Brie, which was formed from the 2nd and 4th battalions of the old R√©giment Royal and organised in Strasbourg. Eventually, on 2 September 1775 a new uniform ordnance was published, the regiment granted 14th in precedence, and gained the following uniform; black tricorne with an iron grey trim, white collar, white jackets, white breeches, black gaiters, black boots, white with iron grey trimmed pockets, iron grey facings, and white buttons.Susane, Volume IV, pp, 177‚Äì180.Lienhart & Humbert, pp, 34, 37, 41, 43. In 1776, the regiment was organised into the following structure: * Regimental Headquarters and Regimental Depot, in Brie-Comte-Robert, Brie * 1st Battalion (Regular Line) * 2nd Battalion (Regular Line) * (3rd Battalion) Bataillon de Laon (Militia/Garrison) The regiment's 3rd militia/garrison battalion was the Battalion of Laon Bataillon de Laon, which was formed following the 1776 ordnance, and commanded 4 fusilier companies, a grenadier company, and the two depots of the 1st and 2nd battalions. In theory the 'militia battalions' were attached to the regiment of the affiliated province, but in-fact acted independently, and only joined these regiments if mobilised. In 1778, the grenadier company of the provincial battalion was separated and joined the R√©giment des Grenadiers Royaux de la Champagne. If mobilised, the garrison battalion would become the 3rd battalion officially and form part of its respective provinces' garrison along with providing drafts to the front- line battalions. The battalion was only mobilised once after the declaration of war against the Kingdom of Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. During this time, the battalion served as part of the garrison in Brie and provided drafts to the regiment to replace the detachments serving in the navy.Susane, Volume VII, pp. 280, 292, 305, 310. The officers of the (3rd) militia battalions served on average some five years or more in the regular battalions, and therefore were able to provide many of the troops in these battalions a lot of experience driven training. This is one of the reasons why when these battalions were disbanded in 1789, the first of the National Volunteers were mostly the old provincial troops, which had years of military training and were thus of a much higher calibre as opposed to the later volunteers.  Anglo-French War  Fusilier of the R√©giment de Brie and Officer (seems like a Major) of the R√©giment Royal in 1789. In 1775, the regiment moved to Phalsbourg, from where in 1776 it moved to La Rochelle, and then to Antibes and Monaco in November 1777. During the late 18th century, the French Royal Navy La Marine Royale had no marines on the model of either the Royal Marines or Continental Marines. They did have naval infantry, l'infanterie de la Marine, and the naval artillery, Les Bombardies de la Marine, but these mostly defended the naval bases and manned the coastal artillery respectively. However, during the war, the shortage of suitable troops to serve as marines was taken up by the infantry, and these detachments known as the Garnisons or Garrisons. During the entirety of the Anglo-French War, some 23 regiments provided garrisons for ships during the war, and even more provided smaller detachments which served in smaller actions.Smith, Kiley, & Black, pp, 178‚Äì179, 232‚Äì233. On 21 May 1776, a new uniform ordnance was published, and the regimental uniform only slightly changed into: black tricorne with an iron grey trim, iron grey collar, white jackets, white breeches, black gaiters, black boots, white with iron grey trimmed pockets, iron grey facings, and white buttons. The regiment provided some detachments for the garrison (marines) of ships during the American Revolutionary War, and these detachments took part in the Battle of Fort Royal near Martinique, and in the Invasion of Tobago, and also later the Capture of Saint Christophe in 1782. Lieutenant Bardin de La Salle was wounded in combat during the Battle of Chesapeake Bay, between Lieutenant G√©n√©ral des Arm√©es Navales Fran√ßois Joseph Paul, Comte de Grasse et Marquis de Grasse-Tilly and Admiral Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves. The main body of the regiment had moved to Neuf-Brisach in December 1778, then to Phalsbourg in December 1779, and in Saint-Pol-de-L√©on in November 1781. This new ordnance grouped most of the line regiments into 10 \\"classes\\" of six regiments each. The exceptions were the Royal regiments, Regiments of the Princes, and the R√©giment de Picardie. Each class was divided further into two \\"divisions\\", each of three regiments. In the case of the Armagnac regiment, it was part of the 4th series and 2nd division, and uniformed as follows; black tricorne, white jacket, steel grey facings, steel grey lapels, white cuffs, white lapels with steel grey piping, and white buttons. There was also a re-organised in the company uniforms, the most notable change was the complete removal of bearskins from the grenadier companies and replaced by a tricorne with a large red pom-pom. This removal was largely ignored though, and all regiments continued to maintain their bearskins well into 1796. The chasseurs maintained a green pom-pom in their cocked hat, and fusilier companies as such: 1st in dark blue, 2nd in aurora, 3rd in violet, and 4th in crimson. The companies also had different turnbacks, the grenadiers with a flaming grenade, fusilier companies with a fleur-de-lis (lille), and chasseurs with a hunting horn.  Peacetime  Jean-Baptiste Gabriel, captain in the R√©giment de Brie, taken sometime between 1776 and 1779, showing the iconic iron grey facings and grey collar. After the Peace of Paris in 1783, the regiment was in Lille, then moved to Berghes, and to Gravelines in April 1786, in Thionville in May 1788 and in September joined the camp in Metz and in September 1789 moved to Cond√©-en-Brie. During the 1790 Lille riots, the battalion was part of the garrison which replaced the old garrison en-masse due to their revolt., and moved to the citadel after order was re-established.  Revolution  Following the French Revolution, the provisional regulations of 1 April 1791 grouped all regiments minus the foreign regiments into the same uniform category, and the uniform became; black bicorne, white jacket, violet facings, violet lapels, violet cuffs, white lapels with violet piping, and white buttons. Another change was the renaming of the old regiments to become their precedence number, thus the regiment became the 24√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie de Ligne (Brie). Although gaining their new numbered title, most regiments including the Brie regiment maintained their new titles until the fall of the monarchy in mid 1792.Smith, Uniforms of the Napleonic Wars, pp. 42‚Äì46.  War of the First Coalition  At the start of the war in 1792, the 1st battalion joined the new formed Army of the Centre Arm√©e du Centre and the 2nd battalion remained in Lille for a while. = 1st Battalion = The 1st battalion distinguished itself during its first official action during the Battle of Jalin and formed part of the defence of the Argonne. After taking part in the decisive Battle of Valmy, the regiment took part in the pursuit of the Prussians back across the border, and later back to the Rhine before settling in Mainz (Moselle). In 1793 it took part in the Army of Custines which later became the Army of the Moselle Arm√©e de la Moselle during the First Siege of Mainz in 1792 and later the Second Siege of Mainz in 1793. In May 1794 the battalion had a day of full glory when the prussians attacked the frontier posts of Hochspeyer, Pirmasens, and Fischbach near Dahn and routed the republican battalions guarding those posts. According to the army report, the battalion which occupied the farm on the road to Landstuhl and Ramstein-Miesenbach, made the most resistance, then withdrew on the road to Schopp, tore hands from the enemy many volunteers and several caissons; but, abandoned to himself and having to do with too superior forces, it was forced to retire to Ratelbein. = 2nd Battalion = Grenadier of (what might be) the R√©giment de Brie in 1786. When the 1st battalion moved east, the 2nd battalion remained in Lille and took part in the events which lead to the massacre of General Th√©obald Dillon, Comte de Dillon. On 22 June, lead by Lieutenant Colonel Lamarche, the battalion attacked a castle belonging to the rebelious Bishop of Tournai, located near N√©chin and between Tournai and Courtrai (Kotrijk) and sized some 10 cannons and ammunition there. The battalion then took part, rather gloriously, in the following Siege of Lille. On 16 October, after the lifting of the siege, the battalion moved to the frontier post of Mouvaux, and almost immedietly attacked by 3,000 Austrians. The battalion then executed an organised retreat to Pont-√†-Marcq and lost only two men, while many Austrians were killed in a small rearguard action. When General Charles-Fran√ßois du P√©rier Dumouriez crossed into the Austrian Netherlands again, the battalion accompanied him, and was placed on the wing and fought during the Battle of Jemappes, and contributed to the capture of the Citadelle d'Anvers, and remained there on garrison. After the Battle of Neerwinden, the battalion returned to the frontier and found itself involved in the Battle of Hondschoote and Battle of Fleurus. = Disbandment = The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Lev√©e en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi-Brigade of Battle. On 10 April 1794, the battalion amalgamated with the 1st Battalion of the Calvados and 1st Battalion of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne to form the new 48√©me Demi-Brigade d'Infanterie. This new demi-brigade served during the Flanders Campaign and later the French Invasion of Holland, and was the only demi-brigade in 1796 which underwent no modifications from that year's amalgamations. Finally, on 17 July 1795, as a result of the 1793 re-organisations, the 1st Battalion amalgamated with the 4th Battalion of the Deux-S√®vres and 9th battalion of the C√¥te-d'Or to form the 1st battalion of the new 47√©me Demi-Brigade d'Infanterie, which continued to serve in the Army of the Rhine and Moselle Arm√©e du Rhin et Moselle.

Colours  A typical regiment consisted of (until 1791) two colours; Regimental Colours Drapeau d'Ordonnance and the Colonel's Colours Drapeau de Colonel, which the later normally consisted of the bourbon flag (pure white) with a light grey trimmed cross imposed throughout. The regiment's colours was divided into four segments, the upper left and bottom right being deep purple, and the upper right and bottom left being a leather brown.

Origins Ezekiel Judah was the scion of a noble Jewish family of Baghdad, known as the Judah family in English, Yehuda family in Hebrew, or originally as the Ma'tuk family. The Ma‚Äôtuk family of Baghdad were descended from Rabbi Ma‚Äôtuk, the last Nasi or Prince of the Jewish community of Anah, on the Euphrates, who fled to Baghdad with his family in the first quarter of the 17th century following the threats of a tyrannical governor who had persecuted the community. Rabbi Ma‚Äôtuk, as was the custom for leaders of leading Jewish communities in Iraq at the time, had been the Saraf-Bashi or Treasurer of the governor. The historian of Baghdad Jewry Rabbi David Solomon Sassoon says the Ma‚Äôtuk family has been established in Anah for centuries. The family‚Äôs flight reflected a shift in the axis of Mesopotamian Jews. The historian of Iraqi Jewry Zvi Yehuda says the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and Persia harmed Anah and the cessation of the caravan trade between Aleppo and Baghdad impoverished the Jewish community, seeing many of the wealthiest Jewish families like the Ma‚Äôtuks depart for Baghdad. Anah, which has previously been a prosperous Jewish centre fell into sharp decline with a Portuguese traveller in 1663 even observing there were only Jews who lived there who made their livelihoods out of making clothe out of camel hair. Despite this, origins in Anah, were in fact seen as a sign of family‚Äôs antiquity amongst Iraqi Jews at the time. This was due to the ancient Iraqi Jewish belief Anah was the site of Nehardea, which features prominently in the Talmud, including as the first seat of the Exhilarch and his Beth Din. The Jews of Anah maintained a belief they were descended from the Babylonian Exile and never subsequently returned to Palestine. The descendants of the Ma'tuk family from Anah, known as the Judah family since the late 18th century, maintain this tradition to this day. That this belief was native to this time is corroborated by Christians missionnaires in Anah in the Nineteenth Century who reported ‚Äúthese Jews maintained their forefathers were of the first captivity, and had never returned to Palestine.‚Äù The family‚Äôs arrival in Baghdad reflected a revival of that city‚Äôs fortunes. Baghdad, having been extinguished as a Jewish centre following its capture by Timur in the Fourteenth Century was re-emerging as a major Jewish centre when the family arrived in the early 17th century. According to historian Zvi Yehuda, the fifteenth century sees no reports on Jews in Baghdad or in its surroundings, in Basra, Hilla, Kifil, Anah, Kurdistan, even in Persia and the Persian Gulf. The migration of the Ma‚Äôtuk family to Baghdad was one part of the city‚Äôs incipient Jewish revival. According to the historian and Rabbi David Solomon Sassoon the family were one of the oldest Jewish families of Baghdad. The Nineteenth Century German ethnographer H. Peterman corroborated writing that the oldest Jewish families of Baghdad came from Anah, amongst them the Ma‚Äôtuk.Historians of Iraqi Jewry recount that the Ma‚Äôtuk or later Yehuda or Judah family achieved great renown as scholars, rabbis, merchants and communal leaders, in Baghdad in the eighteenth and nineteenth century including most prominently through the communal leader, poet and astronomer Sliman Ben David Ma‚Äôtuk, also is also known to historians under the Anglicised name as Solomon Ma‚Äôtuk.  Biography  Ezekiel Judah, born in 1799 or 1800, is referred to by historians or on monuments in the Calcutta synagogues he erected alternately as Ezekiel Judah, Yehezkel Yehuda or Yahuda, or Ezekiel Judah Jacob Sliman or Sulliman. These three different names reflects a moment in time where the emerging Baghdadi Jewish trading diaspora in Asia still used the traditional Jewish naming system of listing a name simply as the first name of a son, father and grandfather for religious and communal purposes but was slowly evolving towards using the Western custom of surnames as families began to travel internationally and engage with the British Empire. However, Iraqi Jewish historians cite the Ma‚Äôtuk clan, descended from Rabbi Ma‚Äôtuk of Anah, as having adopted his name as a name of their clan or a form of surname at least by the mid 17th century if not earlier. According to the chronicler of Iraqi Jewish history Efrayim Haddad, Rabbi Judah Jacob Ma‚Äôtuk was the father of Ezekiel Judah. In his lifetime the family name was changed to the Yehuda or Judah family, as it was later Anglicised in British India. The name Ezekiel Judah Jacob Sulliman, as appears on Neveh Shalom synagogue in Calcutta, is his first name coupled with that of his father and grandfather, without a surname. According to the historian of Iraqi Jewry Abraham Ben-Jacob, ‚Äúamongst the lords of Baghdad at this time the Judah family (Ma‚Äôtuk) occupied a prominent place.‚Äù Rabbi Judah Jacob married twice and was the father of eight sons and two daughters. His eldest son Ezekiel Judah was ‚Äúthe best of his sons‚Äù and became the founder of the Judah family of India. He was seen as the bearer of an aristocratic name of Baghdadi Jews by his contemporaries and was respected by them as a descendant of the renowned Sliman ben David Matuk of Baghdad.He was also a relative of the chief of the powerful merchant and unofficial leader of the Baghdadi Jewish trading diaspora David Sassoon. Historian Abraham Ben-Jacob and the Encyclopedia of the Founders and Builders of Israel refers to Ezekiel Judah as a rabbi. Ezekiel Judah married twice. His first wife was Rachel Haim the daughter of Rabbi Moshe Haim who renewed Torah scholarship in Baghdad. Rabbi Moshe Haim was both the father in law of David Sassoon and Ezekiel Judah creating a family bond between the Judahs and the Sassoons. His second wife was Khatoon Gubbay, the daughter of Rabbi Aaron Saleh Gubbay or Hakham, as the title was referred amongst Mizrahi Jews at the time, the Av Beth Din, or deputy head of the supreme Jewish religious court of Baghdad. The Encyclopaedia of the Founders and Builders of Israel, compiled and published by David Tidhar cites that Ezekiel Judah was himself a great Torah scholar, held a yeshiva and educated the poor with one of his students being the renowned Eliyahu Mani, later to be the Rabbi of Hebron. Accounts vary as to the year Ezekiel Judah established his family permanently in Calcutta. The date of his first arrival in the city is 1820 but according to Rabbi Ezekiel N. Musleah, the last Rabbi of the Jewish community of Calcutta, the year he moved definitively to Bengal was 1838. Ezekiel Judah and members of the Judah family migrated to India in the context of the persecution of the Jews and misrule of Dawud Pasha of Baghdad. Iraqi Jewish historian Abraham Ben-Jacob says the flight of David Sassoon from Baghdad prompted his friend Ezekiel Judah to do the same, travelling with his son Sassoon Judah to India. At first he lived in Bombay and later migrated to Calcutta. His wife subsequently joined him two years later with their son Nissim travelling the long journey to India by donkey. Ezekiel Judah appears to have by trade been a leading indigo, silk and muslin trader. On the back of this fortune as a philanthropist, Ezekiel Judah established the first synagogue in Calcutta, known as Neveh Shalom in Hebrew, which translates as the Abode of Peace, in 1825. He co-founded the second synagogue Beth-El, in 1856 with David Joseph Ezra. Ezekiel Judah and the Judah family are described in the epic travelogue of the Ashkenazi Jewish writer J. J. Benjamin. Describing the community of Calcutta, using the term then in use amongst Mizrahi Jews to refer to a rabbi, he wrote, ‚Äúthey are all well educated, but have no appointed Chachamim; one of the richest commercial men of the town Ezekiel Jehuda Jacob Sliman, a very enlightened man and an excellent talmudist, performs the duties of the Chacham.‚Äù J. J. Benjamin described his visit to Singapore that the elders of the small community there were the sons of Ezekiel Judah. Ezekiel Judah‚Äôs enlightened views can be seen in his view towards the Bene Israel, whom many other Baghdadi Jews sought to separate from and exclude from their synagogues on account of their darker skin and being native to India. In 1843, Ezekiel Judah wrote to the Rabbis of Baghdad concerning the Bene Israel. He wrote, ‚Äúthey give birth to sons and circumcise them as we do, they teach them Talmud- Torah with our children. They are exactly as we, without any difference, and we always call them to the Sefer Torah in accordance with the custom of the Jewish people. May we give them our daughters and may we take their daughters?‚Äù Sadly no record of the response to Ezekiel Judah survives. In Calcutta Ezekiel Judah, as in Bombay like his relative David Sassoon, sought to align the Baghdadi Jewish community with the British and be seen to publicly support the colonial power, eventually become a naturalised British subject. Ezekiel Judah died on April 22nd 1860 in Calcutta, having not reached his sixtieth year.He is buried in Calcutta. For a year after Ezekiel Judah‚Äôs death his sons invited Rabbis from Baghdad, Jerusalem and Syria and the poor Jews of Calcutta to study Torah day and night at his former home.  Legacy  After the death of Ezekiel Judah two branches of the Judah or Yehuda family developed, a rabbinical one settling in Jerusalem and a mercantile one remaining in Calcutta and eventually migrating to London after the end of British rule. Yehuda Family of Jerusalem One of Ezekiel Judah‚Äôs sons by his first marriage was described as a leader amongst the Jewish community in Baghdad. Another by his first marriage, Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda migrated from Baghdad to Jerusalem. In doing so he founded a rabbinical branch of the family known as the Yehuda family of Jerusalem. Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda was bequeathed by his father Ezekiel Judah a share a share in houses in Calcutta worth ¬£25,000 and was thus able to live a life of great wealth and respectability, thanks to the income derived from their rental, of which he set aside a considerable sum for philanthropy. His migration to Jerusalem was described by his descendant David Yellin. Upon arriving in Jerusalem Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda set aside one room of his home for ten students to study Torah throughout the day, often studied with them and established a scholarship fund for their welfare. Thanks to the fortune of his father Ezekiel Judah, Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda played an important role in building the Sephardic Jewish community and rabbinical infrastructure in Jerusalem. He established the yeshiva Knesset Yehezkel, named in honour of his father, in 1858, which he maintained with a large fortune he inherited from his father in Calcutta. After the death of Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda the yeshiva was merged with Hesed El yeshiva founded in 1860. Ezekiel Judah‚Äôs grandson and son of Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda was Rabbi Faraj Haim Yehuda, who was born in 1846 in Baghdad. Rabbi Faraj Haim Yehuda was one of the main builders of the Sephardi community in Jerusalem in the late nineteenth century. He was one of the founders of the Shimon HaTzaddik quarter, a Jerusalem neighborhood established in 1875 by the Eidah Sephardit Committee. In 1882, Rabbi Faraj Haim Yehuda left for India to seek funds from wealthy relatives and the Baghdadi Jewish community established there for the Shimon HaTzaddik synagogue, visiting Bombay. On his return in 1885 he founded the Adat HaBavlim association for Iraqi Jews in Jerusalem with his brother Rabbi Binyamin Yehuda. He was also a known scholar and his book VaTitpallel Hanna was printed in 1889 in Jerusalem and contains prayers, ethics and laws. Rabbi Faraj Chaim Yehuda departed again for India in 1893, dying on his return to Jerusalem in his native city of Baghdad. During his lifetime Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda became close with Ashkenazi scholars. Soon after his arrival Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda stunned deeply conservative Jerusalem religious society in 1854 when he married his daughter Sarah to Joshua Yellin, an Ashkenazi Jew and the son of Polish immigrants. The marriage occurred about four months after Joshua Yellin‚Äôs Bar Mitzvah. Marriages between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews were extremely rare at the time. The Yehuda and Yellin families joined forces to establish the first modern Jewish agricultural colony in Palestine at Motza a few years later. Members of the Yellin family lived in Motza which is today one of the most sought after locations on the approach to Jerusalem. The family at one point aspired but failed to settle Yemenite Jewish immigrants in Motza. The father of Joshua Yellin, David Tavya Yellin, and his father-in-law Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda, bought the land at Motza in 1860 from the Arabs of Qalunya. The historic Yellin family house was built by Joshua Yellin and his family‚Äôs primary residence in 1890. David Yellin, the son of Joshua Yellin and Sarah Yellin, would become one of the central figures of the revival of the modern Hebrew language and a Hebrew poet. He was founder of the Hebrew Language Committee in 1890 upon which the modern Academy of the Hebrew Language is based, taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was a Zionist politician in Ottoman and Mandatory Palestine. David Yellin was from 1903 to 1912 a member of the Jerusalem Municipal Council and from 1905 to 1920 President of the Jewish National Council and deputy mayor of Jerusalem. The Yellins, as descendants of Ezekiel Judah, were viewed as scions of the Sassoon family by their contemporaries. The Yehuda family of Jerusalem continued to actively trade with the Judah family in Calcutta, their wealthy relatives in India throughout the Nineteenth Century. Their trade consisted of Indian products such as tea and indigo. The son of Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda grew close to the Chabad movement in Jerusalem, was known as the Hassid and received support from wealthy relatives in India to repair the second floor of the Chabad synagogue in the Old City. The Chabad synagogue of the Old City, known as Tzemach Tzedek, was built in 1858 with the support of David Sassoon, the second story and a yeshiva being added in 1879 with the support of Elias Sassoon. According to the Encyclopaedia of the Founders and the Builders of Israel, Rabbi Binyamin Yehuda, the son of Rabbi Shlomo Yehezkel Yehuda, died after a collapse in the capital of himself and his brothers meant he was no longer able to distribute alms to the poor as was his custom and ‚Äúout of grief he fell asleep from which he did not arise.‚Äù His sons included the biblical scholar Abraham Shalom Yahuda. Judah Family of Calcutta The mercantile branch of the family remained in India and was known as the Yehuda and subsequently when the name was anglicised during British rule, the Judah family of Calcutta. According to the historian of the Baghdadi Jewish trading diaspora Ezra Yehzkel-Shaked, one of Ezekiel Judah‚Äôs sons by his second marriage, Yosef Yehuda, who remained in India, was described as the ‚Äúking of the Calcutta opium exchange‚Äù and the owner of a ‚Äúfamed sailing vessel‚Äù which made regular voyages from India to Macao and other destinations in China. Calcutta Synagogues In terms of Ezekiel Judah‚Äôs physical legacy the Calcutta synagogues of Neveh Shalom and Beth El remain standing and maintained in the city, whose Jewish community has dwindled to less than twenty people. Despite this they are regularly visited by tourists descendants of the Baghdadi Jewish community and considered a unique part of the city‚Äôs heritage. Given the almost complete destruction of Jewish heritage sites in Syria and Iraq, Ben Judah has noted these age amongst ‚Äúthe last or our synagogues‚Äù built in the traditional Baghdadi style. Descendants Ezekiel Judah‚Äôs descendants included Abraham Yahuda (1877-1951) from the Jerusalem branch and Tim Judah and his son Ben Judah from the Calcutta branch.

Background According to David J. McCutchion, historically the religious architecture in Bengal may be divided into three periods: the early Hindu period (up to the end of the 12th century, or may be a little later in certain areas), the Sultanate period (14th to early 16th century), the Hindu revival period (16th to 19th century). ‚ÄúThe coming of the Muslims at the beginning of the 13th century marked a sharp break with the past. After an initial century of anarchy and consolidation, marked by iconoclastic destruction and militant ‚Äòsufi‚Äô proselytiising, Hindu chiefs and Muslim overlords settled down to some sort of compromise in a common front against Delhi‚Ä¶ Bengal, as we know it today, became an independent entity for the first time. During the following two centuries a distinctive Bengali culture took shape.‚ÄùMcCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, pages 1-14, 19-22. The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, The temples of the pre-Muslim period have nearly all disappeared and from the few that are there the predominant is the tall curvilinear rekha deul, akin to the Odishan style. Another type that is similar to styles in Odisha is the pirha. ‚ÄúBetween the earlier and later Hindu periods astonishing religious changes took place in Bengal: the worship of Vishnu gave way to that of Radha-Krishna, of Chamunda to that of Kali; Surya fell entirely out of favour; curious folk cults like that of Dharmaraja or Dakshina Raya arose.‚Äù There have also been changes in temple architecture. The rekha deul continues, the pirha has become rare, other old forms have disappeared. Two new styles are predominant ‚Äì the hut (chala) style similar to the mud hut with a thatched roof and the pinnacled (ratna) style which is closest to Islamic traditions. Chala temple The ek- bangla or do-chala consists of a hut with two sloping roofs, following the pattern of huts, mostly in East Bengal villages. It was first adopted in Muslim architecture, a prominent example being the Maosoleum of Fateh Khan at Gauda. Two such huts, one forming a porch in front and the other being the shrine at the back constitutes the jor-bangla ‚Äì ‚ÄúBengal‚Äôs most distinctive contribution to temple design‚Äù. In West Bengal, the hut roof generally has four sides and the char-chala temple is built on this model. When a miniature is built on the roof, it becomes an at-chala. The char-chala temples started coming up around the 17th century. Apart from the main shrines, nahabatkhana or entrance gateways also have char-chala roof.

The simplest form has a single central tower (eka-ratna), to which may be added four more at the corners (pancha-ratna)‚Äù. The number of towers or pinnacles can be increased up to a maximum of twentyfive. The ratna style came up in the 15th-16th century. Muslim domed temples are very rare, except possibly in Cooch Behar. ‚ÄúRatna style temples are the composite type of architecture‚Ä¶ The lower part of the temple has all the features of the curved cornices and a short pointed spire crowns the roof and this will be adorned with the introduction of ratnas or kiosks.‚Äù File:Ram Chandraji temple of Guptipara in Hooghly district 01.jpgEk-ratna Ramchandraji temple at Guptipara, Hooghly district File:Ek Ratna Gopinath Temple at Radhakantapur under Daspur Police Station at Paschim Medinipur district in West Bengal 28.jpgEk-ratna temple at Radhakantapur, Paschim Medinipur district File:Shyam Rai Temple, Bankura.JPGPancha-ratna Shyam Rai temple at Bishnupur, Bankura district File:Radhabinod temple of Joydeb Kenduli in Birbhum district 03.jpgNava-ratna Radha Binode temple at Jaydev Kenduli, Birbhum district File:Haneswari and Vasudev temples3.jpgWith 13 minars Hangseshwari temple has a distinct identity, at Bansberia, Hooghly district File:17 pinnacled Parbatinath Temple in Raghunathpur area at Chandrakona Town In Paschim Medinipur district 13.jpgSaptadasa-ratna Parvatinatha Temple at Chandrakona, Paschim Medinipur district with 17 pinnacles File:Gopalbari Temple Kalna.jpgPanchavimsati-ratna Gopalbari temple at Kalna City, Purba Bardhaman district, with 25 pinnacles File:25 pinnacle Rasmancha of Narajole Rajbari in Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal 01.jpgPanchavimsati-ratna rasmancha at Narajole, Paschim Medinipur district, with 25 pinnacles Dalan temple The flat-roofed (dalan) temples ‚Äúwith their heavy cornices on S-curved brackets they too have a long Indo-Islamic place and temple tradition‚Äù and then was influenced by European ideas in the 19th century.

Some are smooth curvilinear and others are ridged curvilinear. In the smooth type, the sikhara is free of horizotal bars and in ridged type, it is closely ridged with bars. The ratha projections are generally deep and spaced, and sometimes decorated. The crowning amalaka is generally large and flat. There are large and small types of deuls. Many of the very small types dispense with the complicated styling. It went on developing from the late 7th century or early 8th century to around the 12th century, increasing its complexity and height but retaining its basic features. The Odisha temple is considered remarkable for its plan and elevation. The base is normally square in Hindu temple architecture. The structure of the temple is marked by vertical offset projections called rathas (on plan) and pagas (on elevation). The main temple (the rekha deul) rests on a high platform called pista. The assembly hall is called jagamohan, through which the devotees reach the main temple. The deity is placed in the garbhagriha, over which the sikhara rises.

Iacopi was appointed representative for the IEEE Electron Devices Society to the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS) in 2019. She founded and was the inaugural chair of IEEE Electron Device Society Chapter in New South Wales in 2019.  Education  Following her high school degree at the Liceo Scientifico Augusto Righi in Bologna, Iacopi went on to complete her Master‚Äôs degree in Physics from La Sapienza University of Rome in 1996 and then moved to Belgium for her doctoral studies. She received her Ph.D. degree in Materials and Electrical Engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in 2004, under the supervision of Karen Maex. Later, she also completed a Master‚Äôs of Arts in Cultural Anthropology and Development Studies from the same university in 2009.  Career  During her M.Sc. studies, Iacopi worked as a junior researcher at the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics from 1995 till 1998 and later moved to Belgium with a position at Vrije Universiteit Brussel in collaboration with CERN, Switzerland till 1999. In the following decade, Iacopi joined the Inter- university Microelectronics Center in Leuven, Belgium, as a research scientist and later got promoted to senior scientist from 2006. During her term in IMEC, Iacopi researched on interconnects and nanotechnology. Afterwards, she spent one year in Japan, where she was appointed Guest Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo, Kashiwa Campus, to study novel plasma processes. In 2010, she moved to USA and accepted an industrial position at Globalfoundries as a Manager of Customer Packaging Technology and directed the Chip-Package Interaction strategy for the company. Subsequently, Iacopi moved to Australia for a research position with Griffith University, where in 2012, she was awarded a Future Fellowship from the Australian Research Council. During this period, she founded her own research group and invented a catalytic process to obtain epitaxial graphene from silicon carbide on silicon. In 2015, she became a member of Advance Queensland Panel of Experts for the Queensland Government. During this time, she served as an advisor to the Queensland Government on the Science and Innovation for the State. In 2016, Iacopi joined University of Technology Sydney and was appointed as Full Professor. She leads the Integrated Nanosystems Research Lab. In 2017, she served as Head of Discipline, Communications and Electronics for two years; in 2019, she founded and chaired the IEEE Electron Device Society Chapter in New South Wales, along with being appointed as Associate Investigator at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies (FLEET). In 2020, she was appointed as Chief Investigator for the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems.  Research and work  Iacopi‚Äôs notable research areas include Nanoelectronics, Semiconductors, 2D Materials, Nanophotonics and Energy Storage. Iacopi‚Äôs earliest research focused on instrumentation for Medical Nuclear Imaging. In late 1990s, she worked on the forward tracker portion of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector. The underlying purpose of the research was the tracking of elementary particles through interaction of radiation with materials. In a report about the tests of CMS microstrip gas chamber (MSGC) modules at PSI, Iacopi and her colleagues conducted the CMS experiment and tested two CMS MSGC that were similar to the barrel of the tracker, using a high intensity beam. The inner layer of MSGC in CMS proved to be stable in terms of voltage, thus rendering the experiment successful. However, shortly after, a decision was made to change the technology for the CMS tracker to silicon detectors. In 1999, Iacopi started working at one of the largest independent R&D; centers for semiconductors (IMEC) and focused on ultra-low-k/Highly porous dielectrics for on-chip interconnects. She is author of several seminal works in this area, which also led to technological implementation in the semiconductor industry. Iacopi authored an article about the problems with the structural stability of ultra-low-k-based interconnects and points that relaxation in ultra-low-k-based interconnect structures, either due to adhesion failure or by porous dielectrics compliance, can prove to be damaging in the interconnects. She proposed solutions to prevent the relaxation by either mechanism. She also defined the parameters required to generate well-grounded quantitative predictions. Her research at IMEC highlighted the issue of uncontrolled diffusion of species in the dielectric pores, and directed the slowing of the projection for the industrial uptake of ultra-low-k dielectrics by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). Iacopi‚Äôs research focus then shifted to semiconductor compatible growth and integration of semiconductor nanowires for electronic applications like Tunnel -Field Effect Transistors (T-FETs). Her main contribution has been the identification of indium as potential replacement for gold in the seeded nanowire growth by the vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) method. In an article published in 2008, Iacopi presented the size related characteristics of Indium-seeded silicon nanowires. She bases her research on the fact that the growth structure of nanowires change considerably when the size is in tens of nanometers. Iacopi suggested a model to counter this issue. In a similar article about the growth of silicon nanowires, Iacopi states that bottom-up manufacturing of nanowires for microelectronics is difficult as the characteristics of the wires would have to be controlled at the wafer -scale. She reviews the constraints for establishing a controlled process of a VLS growth of silicon nanowires and proposes suggestions for achieving the nanowire growth in a controlled manner. In early 2010s, Iacopi worked on the demonstration that cold plasmas can be an effective solution to slow down the diffusion of reactive species into porous media. She wrote an article in 2011 about the cryogenic plasmas and nanoporous materials. Through her research, Iacopi demonstrated that by processing plasma at cryogenic temperatures, the diffusion of plasma into nanoporous materials can be considerably suppressed. She further demonstrates that this suppression is controlled by reaction factors, radical recombination and sticking coefficient. While working at Griffith University, Iacopi invented a direct and selective process for the wafer-scale synthesis of graphene on silicon, with applications in integrated micro technologies, including nanophotonics, bio-compatible sensing, and energy storage. Iacopi wrote an article about graphene growth with a nickel- copper alloy as catalyst. She obtained a few-layers graphene by a solid-source growth method with nickel-copper alloy as a mediator onto silicon carbide on silicon. It was found that this was the most suitable method of obtaining large-scale epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide on silicon. Iacopi describes the procedure for graphene synthesis in the article and also discusses the key characteristics of the process. In a similar article in 2014 about the graphitized silicon carbide microbeams, Iacopi explains the proven procedures and methods to obtain graphene on silicon wafers in a site-selective way, while also discussing the limitations. This research points to the replacing conductive metal films in MEMS and NEMS devices with the carbon-nickel alloy method. This invention earned her a Global Innovation Award from the TechConnect in 2014. Because of her research contributions, Iacopi and her research has been cited in various announcements and press-releases. In a follow-up to this research, she further proves the effectiveness of using the nickel-copper alloy for the production of large ‚Äìscale epitaxial graphene on silicon with electrical conductivity comparable to graphene on silicon carbide wafers. Her current research at the University of Technology Sydney focuses on graphene and other two-dimensional materials on silicon for More-than-Moore applications, and to enable novel materials and functionalities for miniaturized systems encompassing electronics, photonics, sensing and energy.

He designed Bishopskop for Michael Furse, bishop of Pretoria. He also designed his own house in Parktown, Endstead Early life At birth, Sloper was named Ernest Willmott but changed his name to Ernest Sloper before he left Britain for in South Africa in 1902. He was born in Britain and received his schooling at Queen's College, Taunton, Somerset. He studied art part time at the Taunton Art School while working for an architect named Roberts in Taunton. At around about this time he worked on the Great Western Railway as a resident engineer responsible for the Kingsbridge branch line in Devon. While working in Devon he met with GF Bodley, an architect. Willmott then began working in the London offices of the architectural practice of Bodley & Garner. With Garner he designed the Empire Hotel, Buxton. South Africa In 1902 Sloper moved to South Africa where he joined Herbert Baker's office in Cape Town. Later in 1902 Baker and Sloper relocated to Johannesburg. In 1903 Sloper joined the practice of Baker & Massey as a partner and the firm was named Baker, Masey & Sloper. Baker valued Sloper's contribution to the firm noting '[Sloper] showed great gifts in educating builders and craftsmen to better methods of building and the use of local materials. The excellence of the walling built of koppie stone was largely due to his perseverance and encouragement to the masons'. Sloper paid great attention to the setting of the house in the garden; this is best seen in Howard Pim's house Timewell where terraces were created using koppie-stone retaining walls. These terraces were planted with indigenous shrubs. Joane Pim, the daughter of Howard Pim, who became a well-known gardener designer in Johannesburg, would have been influenced by growing up in the garden designed by Sloper. Sloper was credited by Professor Geoffrey Eastcott Pearse with starting architectural education in the Transvaal. In 1903 Sloper began giving classes at the School of Mines and Technology in Johannesburg in architectural design. Pearse was one of the first six pupils in those classes.

It was written by Branko Gr√ºnbaum, with contributions from Victor Klee, Micha Perles, and G. C. Shephard, and published in 1967 by John Wiley & Sons. It went out of print in 1970. A second edition, prepared with the assistance of Volker Kaibel, Victor Klee, and G√ºnter M. Ziegler, was published by Springer-Verlag in 2003, as volume 221 of their book series Graduate Texts in Mathematics. Convex Polytopes was the winner of the 2005 Leroy P. Steele Prize for mathematical exposition, given by the American Mathematical Society. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has recommended its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. Topics The book has 19 chapters. After two chapters introducing background material in linear algebra, topology, and convex geometry, two more chapters provide basic definitions of polyhedra, in their two dual versions (intersections of half-spaces and convex hulls of finite point sets), introduce Schlegel diagrams, and provide some basic examples including the cyclic polytopes. Chapter 5 introduces Gale diagrams, and the next two chapters use them to study polytopes with a number of vertices only slightly higher than their dimension, and neighborly polytopes. Chapters 8 through 11 study the numbers of faces of different dimensions in polytopes through Euler's polyhedral formula, the Dehn‚ÄìSommerville equations, and the extremal combinatorics of numbers of faces in polytopes. Chapter 11 connects the low- dimensional faces together into the skeleton of a polytope, and proves the van Kampen‚ÄìFlores theorem about non-embeddability of skeletons into lower- dimensional spaces. Chapter 12 studies the question of when a skeleton uniquely determines the higher-dimensional combinatorial structure of its polytope. Chapter 13 provides a complete answer to this theorem for three- dimensional convex polytopes via Steinitz's theorem, which characterizes the graphs of convex polyhedra combinatorially and can be used to show that they can only be realized as a convex polyhedron in one way. It also touches on the multisets of face sizes that can be realized as polyhedra (Eberhard's theorem) and on the combinatorial types of polyhedra that can have inscribed spheres or circumscribed spheres. Chapter 14 concerns relations analogous to the Dehn‚ÄìSommerville equations for sums of angles of polytopes, and uses sums of angles to define a central point, the \\"Steiner point\\", for any polytope. Chapter 15 studies Minkowski addition and Blaschke addition, two operations by which polytopes can be combined to produce other polytopes. Chapters 16 and 17 study shortest paths and the Hirsch conjecture, longest paths and Hamiltonian cycles, and the shortness exponent of polytopes. Chapter 18 studies arrangements of hyperplanes and their dual relation to the combinatorial structure of zonotopes. A concluding chapter, chapter 19, also includes material on the symmetries of polytopes. Exercises throughout the book make it usable as a textbook, and provide additional links to recent research, and the later chapters of the book also list many open research problems. The second edition of the book keeps the content, organization, and pagination of the first edition intact, adding to it notes at the ends of each chapter on updates to the material in that chapter. These updates include material on Mn√´v's universality theorem and its relation to the realizability of polytopes from their combinatorial structures, the proof of the g-conjecture for simplicial spheres, and Kalai's conjecture. The second edition also provides an improved bibliography. Topics that are important to the theory of convex polytopes but not well-covered in the book Convex Polytopes include Hilbert's third problem and the theory of Dehn invariants. Audience and reception Although written at a graduate level, the main prerequisites for reading the book are linear algebra and general topology, both at an undergraduate level. In a review of the first edition of the book, Werner Fenchel calls it \\"a remarkable achievement\\", \\"a wealth of material\\", \\"well organized and presented in a lucid style\\". Over 35 years later, in giving the Steele Prize to Gr√ºnbaum for Convex Polytopes, the American Mathematical Society wrote that the book \\"has served both as a standard reference and as an inspiration\\", that it was in large part responsible for the vibrant ongoing research in polyhedral combinatorics, and that it remained relevant to this area. Reviewing and welcoming the second edition, Peter McMullen wrote that despite being \\"immediately rendered obselete\\" by the research that it sparked, the book was still essential reading for researchers in this area.

In 2002, the band released an EP \\"–•–ª–µ–±\\" (The Bread) together with SPERMADONARZ. A concert in support of \\"The Bread\\" was scheduled on November 26, 2002, in a new club \\"Orlandina\\". All the bandmates were there on time except of Liolik who had mysteriously disappeared. Later they found out that Liolik was on his way to the club when he was stopped by a police patrol to verify his documents and unexpectedly was drafted into the military service for two years. Denis have wanted to become a singer and the team was started looking for a new bass player. They tried to take Pavel Vovka as a new bass player, but later he left the band. The recording of the album was hard. The sound was raw, and they didn't have a good gear for that. \\"Vechno Pryachetsya Sud'ba\\" was recorded in \\"Red Club\\". The album was released on November 14, 2003 and was presented in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. It was named after one of the songs that was inspired by Irvine Welsh's novella ¬´ Fortune's Always Hiding ¬ª from his trilogy Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance. All lyrics were written by DENVER and LEXUS. Music was written by GANG.  Musical style  Unlike other Amatory records, Fortune's Always Hiding features more nu metal sound. The album was recorded in Drop B tuning. However, it includes the elements of deathcore, hip-hop and alternative metal.. The sound of that album was compared to Slipknot's Iowa.

It is an erect shrub with hairy branches, narrow egg-shaped leaves and clusters of pale mauve to dark purple-mauve flowers arranged on the ends of branchlets. Description Prostanthera cineolifera is an erect, strongly aromatic shrub that typically grows to a height of with hairy, glandular stems. The leaves are narrow egg-shaped, light green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branchlets with bracteoles long that fall off as the flowers develop. The sepals are long and form a tube long with two lobes, the upper lobe long. The petals are pale mauve to dark purple-mauve, long, and fused to form a tube that is darker on the inside. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy Prostanthera cineolifera was first formally described in 1912 by Richard Thomas Baker and Henry George Smith in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. Distribution and habitat Singleton mint bush has been observed in scattered localities in New South Wales including at Apsley Falls near Walcha, and at scattered places in the Hunter Valley. It grows in forest and woodland on exposed ridges. Conservation status This mintbush is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species include inappropriate fire regimes and its apparently small population size.

Early life, Education and Career  He was born in Moscow to Evgenij Pavloviƒç Demidov, a land improvement engineer, and to Elvira Ivanovna Mazeina, an electric assembly technician in missile production. After the School No. 668 (1978 - 1988) in Moscow he graduated in navigation at Odessa State Maritime Academy (1988 - 1994). The study included a year and a half at sea, sailing the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea on school's training and trading vessels. As there was no suitable job in the Russian merchant fleet for him at the time, he returned to Moscow in 1994. After different jobs, including a 7-month stint aboard a Russian fishing boat in Fiji in 2004 as a representative of ship owner, Tuna Fishing Company, he settled in industrial rope access.  Speleology  During school excursions to the mountains of Crimea, Western Caucasus and during yearly trips to the village Verhnjaja (Upper) Sysert in the southern Ural mountains, where his grandmother lived, Demidov developed an interest in nature and in mountain climbing. To get better acquainted with rope climbing he enlisted in the caving school of the Perovo caving club in Moscow in 2000. Pe≈°ƒçera Zablud≈°ih (Cave of the Lost) of Alek mountain range above Sochi, close to the Black Sea was the first cave he visited, in February 2000. The cave, discovered in 1966, was often visited by caving schools as it is difficult enough and deep enough, to the terminal siphon at -420 m. Demidov and 3 other caving school participants: P√´tr Ljubimov - Petja, Konstantin Zverev - Kostja and Roman Zverev managed to bypass the siphon and discovered a new branch of the cave on the other side. They made 5 more expeditions in 2000, 3 to the same cave, one to a cave in Skalisty hrebet (Rocky Range, North Caucasus) - and one to Ver√´vkina cave which was discovered in 1968, rediscovered in 1982 and in 1986 explored to -440 m. The expedition in 2000 was the first to this cave after the 1992/93 war in Abkhazia, and also the first expedition using the single- rope technique. As there are no suitable caves in central Russia caving excursions are always in form of expeditions which usually last from three weeks to one month. In 2002 Demidov, Ljubimov and both Zverevs founded the Perovo-speleo team and the first cave where the team made a major contribution was Only Stones cave in August 2002, on Arabika massif, in the Dzou area. The cave, discovered by Italians, is close to a lake, at 2,000 m above sea level, and has a tall entrance. At the time it was 200 m deep and they managed to deepen it to 360 m. During an expedition in August 2004 they discovered Vjatskaja cave, in the same area. Only Stones ended with a large collapse while Vjatskaja continued, so they made several further expeditions into it, after several years it was 453 m deep. After 2001 Demidov and the team were also developing several caves on the Bzyb massif, adjacent to Arabika, such as Habju cave in 2001, Napra cave in 2001‚Äì2003, and Pantjuhinskaja cave in 2008. They also participated in expeditions to caves of other caving clubs, to Krubera-Voronja on Arabika in 2005, to Sne≈ænaja cave on Bzyb in 2016. Ver√´vkina - profile with surface - north-south from the west  Ver√´vkina Cave  When the team started to work in Ver√´vkina in 2000 it was 440 m deep with a narrow and long meander at the bottom. It was necessary to carry the excavated material very far. In November 2002 there was one more trip to the bottom: Demidov, Kostja, Petja, Grigorij Saneviƒç - Gri≈°a, also with Danila and Filip ƒåeredniƒçenko from St. Petersburg. They decided to search for some other continuation on the way from the bottom to the entrance. At the depth of 120 m they discovered a narrow meander, where Demidov managed to pass through, to the top of a shaft. It continued. Every year until 2010 the team advanced, on 6 expeditions, following the draft in windows above the blind shaft bottoms. In 2010 they came to a meander at the depth of 320 to 340 m where they stopped and abandoned further exploration of the cave. In February 2007 Perovo-speleo started to continue the development of Moskovskaja cave. It is also situated in the Dzou area, it was explored in the eighties to a depth of 980 m; the entrance is at 2,307 m above sea level. Evgenij Starodubov, the only one left of the team who initially explored the cave, left the cave to Perovo-speleo to develop it further. They made 5 expeditions into it. On the second expedition they dug through a narrow meander, bypassed the siphon and reached the depth of 1,000 m. Further expeditions brought the depth of 1,250 m where an underground creek flows into a siphon. For the work in Moskovskaja cave the team, led by Demidov, was awarded the A. Morozov medal for 2011, the highest Russian award for achievements in speleology. Further expeditions, the last in 2015, discovered several side branches of the cave but none past the terminal siphon. As the team returned to Abkhazian coast in August 2015, to Gagra, they met Aleksej Bara≈°kov, the new president of Perovo caving club, where the team's caving career began. They were also exploring Ver√´vkina and in 2009 while they traveled to the cave from Gagra, on a track high in the mountain the jeep, a GAZ-66 capsized and two explorers were injured, one badly. So Perovo speleoclub discontinued explorations in Ver√´vkina, until 2012. In 2013 they broke through a narrow passage at the new bottom (where Perovo-speleo stopped in 2010), at -340 m, and reached a junction of two meanders. One had a strong draft, the other had flowing water (Narnia branch). They followed the water and lost two years in that branch, it was all very narrow. In 2015 they decided to try the meander with draft and with little digging they reached another shaft, at an estimated depth of 360 m, where they stopped because of lack of rope and time. As the cave was developed by both clubs Perovo-speleo, led by Demidov, decided to proceed at that point. In the winter 2015/2016 the access was too difficult so the next, very small expedition took place in June 2016. At the bottom of the last, 30 m shaft, Evgenij Kuzmin discovered a continuation, Babatunda, the biggest hall in the cave, 155 m deep. They reached the depth of 630 m. Demidov is ascending the Babatunda pit in Ver√´vkina cave, by P√´tr Ljubimov In August 2016 a joint expedition of both teams followed and reached the depth of -1000 m, with an open continuation. During the October/November 2016 expedition of the two teams the cave was deepened to 1350 m, but snow surprised the cavers on exit, roads were impassable, all-road truck could not come and they walked 3 days in the snow to reach the valley. Next expedition in February 2017 used a helicopter to get to the entrance and reached the depth of 1832 m, Ver√´vkina cave became the second deepest in the world, after Krubera-Voronja. The achievement brought Perovo-speleo team, represented by Demidov, UIS Prize for 2017 in the category The most significant discovery/exploration. In early August 2017 cavers of Perovo speleo club descended to -2155 m, where they found a siphon and returned. In mid-August Perovo-speleo team, with Czech caver Zdenek Dvo≈ôak, mapped 7 km of new horizontal passages, reached an underground river with a flowrate of 500 liters per second and two terminal siphons at the depth of 2204 m. Ver√´vkina became the deepest cave in the world. In February 2018 a small expedition of 4, led by Demidov, reached 2212 m, final depth of the cave, at the bottom of the Captain Nemo siphon. Several expeditions followed, including a photo trip to the bottom of the cave in September 2018 with the English cave photographer Robbie Shone, during which the team was surprised by a rain storm which flooded the lower level of the cave. Final cave length, 17.5 km, was surveyed in August 2019. Demidov also helped to promote scientific research in the cave, where it is possible to access an extensive net of passages below -2000 m without diving, from temperature and water pressure measurements to search for new fauna species. Ver√´vkina cave exploration was presented at several international events, found a wide reaching echo, and Demidov's experience was called for during the cave-related events of general interest.  Other Pursuits  In October 2006 Demidov participated in an international expedition to Ghar Parau cave in Iran, in July 2007 he joined the CAVEX team to Sima GESM cave in Sierra de las Nieves mountain range in Spain, in September and October 2007 and in September 2010 he took part in the Sino-Anglo-Russian expedition to deep caves of Tianxing, China. In November 2012 Demidov visited Gran Caverna de Santo Tom√°s in Vi√±ales, Cuba, in August 2013 caves in Northern Macedonia and in August 2014 he participated in another CAVEX team expedition to Spain, to Sima de las Puertas Illamina (BU56). In January 2017 he attended the International Caving Meeting FinalMenteSpeleo2017 in Italy and in November 2017 he took part in cave rescue training in caves of Chatyr-Dag mountains in Crimea. In June 2018 he joined the exploration of the cave W le Donne in Italy. In 2004 he worked on a boat at the Fiji islands, where many Russian expatriates also settled, and he returned to Fiji several times later. From November 2008 to March 2009 he crossed the main island, Viti Levu on foot, while the crossing of the second island, Vanua Levu, in 2012 failed halfway through because of the wasp bite which required hospitalisation. From January to May 2019 he made a trek over the Viti Levu mountains. The caves of Fiji were not of interest to him.  Death  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic caving expeditions to deep caves on Arabika massif in the summer 2020 were cancelled, yet when the border with Abkhazia reopened on August 1, a few expeditions nevertheless took place. Demidov joined a CAVEX team expedition to the Integral cave, situated north of Ver√´vkina, 2,345 m above sea level, and the depth of 200 m. On August 23, he and Stanislav Homjakov came to the meander, which was the last explored point of the cave, at a depth of 305 m. The meander begins with a narrow passage among stones and boulders at the bottom of a collapse hall. Both cavers easily overcame this obstacle and, after passing a short meander, came to a small ledge. Demidov went back to fetch a rope, and Homjakov remained to clear the ledge of loose stones. After a while Homjakov, worried about Demidov's long absence, climbed back. He saw a new collapse of clay and stones with Demidov in the center of it, without any signs of life. A large rescue operation followed and on September 1 Demidov's body was lifted to the surface.

In particular it makes provisions for the licensing and the safe and orderly abandonment of installations and submarine pipelines.  Background  The cost of totally removing all existing offshore installations on the UK continental shelf was estimated, in 1984, to be ¬£6 billion (1984 prices). The government hoped that costs could be saved by allowing the partial, rather than the total, removal of installations. It was necessary that an appropriate framework should be in place to set standards for the removal operations. Apart from the interests of oil companies there were those of fishermen and mariners, the UK's obligations under international law and the interests of the taxpayer. The responsibility for removal rested with the owners of an installation or pipeline. There should be criminal offences for failure to comply with obligations. The government gave the Secretary of State enabling powers to make regulations concerning detailed standards for abandonment. In addition to an abandonment regime it was necessary to update the royalty regime by rationalising the procedures for royalty accounting and arbitration and the provisions for the measurement of petroleum. Furthermore, enabling powers were needed to allow repayment of royalties to make allowance for abandonment costs. The UK offshore licensing regime needed to be extended to the territorial waters of Northern Ireland. In 1987 each safety zone round an installation had to be established by statutory instrument. Legislation was necessary to provide for the automatic creation of a 500 metre safety zones around offshore installations. Updated legislation for onshore pipelines was required, especially provisions for insurance arrangements; the Secretary of State was empowered to prohibit the use or testing of any pipeline unless funds were available to discharge any liability for loss or damage.  The Petroleum Act 1987  The Petroleum Act 1987 (1987 c. 12) received Royal Assent on 9 April 1987. Its long title is: ‚ÄòAn Act to make provision in respect of the abandonment of onshore installations and submarine pipe-lines and in respect of safety zones around offshore installations; to amend the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934 and to make provision in respect of licences under that Act; to amend the law relating to pipe-lines; to repeal sections 34 to 39 of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe- lines Act 1975; and for connected purposes.‚Äô  Provisions  The Act comprises 32 Sections in 4 Parts and 3 Schedules: * PART I Abandonment of Offshore Installations ** Sections 1 to 16 ‚Äì Programmes for abandonment, appropriate persons to submit programmes, notices, approvals, failure to submit programmes, revision of programmes, withdrawal of approval, duty to carry out programmes, default in carrying out programmes, financial resources, making regulations, offences, the powers of the Secretary of State, notices. * PART II Licensing ** Sections 17 to 20 ‚Äì existing licences, future licences, extension to Northern Ireland territorial waters, annual reports. * PART III Miscellaneous ** Safety zones ‚Äì Sections 21 to 24 ‚Äì automatic establishment of safety zones, establishment by order, safety zone offences. ** Pipe-lines ‚Äì Sections 25 to 27 ‚Äì construction authorisations, funds, compulsory acquisition of rights. ** Refineries ‚Äì Section 28 ‚Äì construction of refineries (repealing existing legislation). * PART IV Supplementary ** Sections 29 to 32 ‚Äì expenses, repeals, commencement, short title and extent. * SCHEDULES ** Schedule 1‚Äì Amendment of Existing Licences ** Schedule 2 ‚Äì Amendment of Model Clauses ** Schedule 3 ‚Äì Repeals  Effects of the Act  The 1987 Act provided a framework for the abandonment of Offshore Installations on the UK continental shelf. The first decommissioning approval was given in 1988 for the abandonment, by toppling, of the remains of the Piper Alpha platform. The first decommissioning approval for a floating production facility (FPF) was given in 1991 for the Crawford FPF. The first fixed steel platform to be entirely removed to shore was the Forbes AW platform in 1993.  Later enactments  Parts I and II of the 1987 Act were repealed on 15 February 1999 by the Petroleum Act 1998. Part III section 28 (construction of refineries) was repealed on 15 February 1999 by the Petroleum Act 1998.

Bern√®s.\\"En Passant\\", The Theatre, 28 August 1877, p. 72 Plot Gaston is a genial, strapping young man of twenty- two, but he is still called \\"B√©b√©\\" by his doting parents, Baron d'Aigreville and his wife. Gaston has been indulged all his life, and in consequence is ill-educated and amoral. The Baronne views him through the eye of love as a paragon of perfection, a model of virtue and innocence. He is engaged to be married to Mathilde, a rich heiress, whose guardian, a country cousin named Kernanigous, has just arrived in Paris with his wife, Diane. Usually Kernanigous' trips to Paris are unaccompanied, so that he can visit the cocotte Aur√©lie de Villecouteuse. When he hears Gaston's mother boasting of the perfect purity of her son, he cannot restrain himself from declaring that in his opinion no man can be a good husband unless he has sown his wild oats before marriage. In Kernanigous's view, before marrying, a young man should have been on intimate terms with three distinct categories of the opposite sex: chambermaids, demi-mondaines and married women. Saint-Germain as P√©tillon Unknown to his adoring mother, Gaston has already attended to the first two of the items on Kernanigous' list ‚Äì having slept with his mother's maid, Toinette, and moved on to Aur√©lie de Villecouteuse ‚Äì and he is looking forward to engaging in the third. Kernanigous' attractive wife Diane seems to him an ideal subject. She, having discovered her husband's relationship with Am√©lie, is disposed to take her revenge by a liaison with Gaston. Gaston and a friend are being coached for the legal profession by an eccentric tutor called P√©tillon. When he should be lecturing, he encourages his students and their girlfriends to dance a cancan of the wildest kind. The Baron suddenly makes an appearance to demand what is the meaning of the music. The women are bundled out of sight and P√©tillon convinces the Baron that he has discovered \\"une m√©thode mn√©motechnique\\", an infallible way of cramming legal facts into the heads of his students: he has set the legal code to music, and he gives the Baron an example, singing some dry legal dictums to the tunes of popular songs. Gaston's exploits lead to a frantic farcical sequence in Hennequin's customary manner: the characters rush in and out, hide, and are mistaken for others. Finally it turns out that Aur√©lie is P√©tillon's estranged wife, and he is delighted to find that her infidelities mean that he can discontinue his ruinous maintenance payments to her. The Baron reproaches his erring son when the latter's affairs are revealed, but Gaston successfully bids his father remember his own misspent youth, and all is forgiven.

Early years Born Alice Atherton Hogan to humble origins in Cincinnati; the daughter of William Hogan (1827‚Äì1907) and Sarah Bennett. Her family resided in Cincinnati (1860 census) with her Kentucky born father's profession being listed as a brush maker. Atherton had a gift for impersonation from a young age. Her career began as a child actress, carried on as a baby in \\"The Sea of Ice\\", at the Robinson‚Äôs Opera House in her home city, Cincinnati. Some obituaries refer to her as having been born in St. Louis; her place of marriage. Career Atherton was discovered by Lydia Thompson, an English dancer, comedian, actress, and theatrical producer, who is recognized for introducing Victorian burlesque to the United States in August 1868, to great acclaim and notoriety. Atherton was enrolled as one of her girls in \\"Ixion\\". This was Thompson's first U.S. show and it was a huge success. It included wit, parody, song, dance, spectacle, music, and it has since been said it even empowered women. 1868 programme for Ixion This launched her career and that of several actresses, including Lisa Weber, and Rose Coghlan. It also drew fierce criticism from those who felt it transgressed the boundaries of propriety at the time. Burlesques, colloquially referred to as leg-shows, started off very tame, clever, and sophisticated, drawing in all types of people, especially women. Unfortunately, ‚Äúthe female audiences for burlesque did not last for long. In the summer of 1869 a wave of ‚Äòanti-burlesque hysteria‚Äô in the New York press frightened away the middle-class audiences that had initially been drawn to Ixion and sent the Thompson troupe prematurely packing on a tour around the United States and Canada. Other shows followed, such as \\"Sinbad\\" and Atherton went on to become recognized as one of the best-natured, adventurous performers of the stage during the 1870s‚Äì1890s. Alice Atherton in Forty Thieves in 1869Atherton‚Äôs versatility as a performer became legendary, as a comic singer, a virtuoso whistler, and her \\"laughing song\\" became her signature piece. Though a parodist, she also excelled in comic roles that did not require playing a type.

In the company was a sixteen-year-old Atherton. Three years later she married her English co- performer, Willie, on December 27, 1873 in St Louis. Together they became mainstays of the Coville burlesque companies. He organized the entertainment \\"Dreams, or Fun in the Photograph Gallery,\\" a piece that showed off her skill for impersonation and popularized the comic skit as a stage form. Atherton‚Äôs image on promotional picture cards According to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, in NYC, which displays her cards, they were issued between 1880 and 1892 by Thomas H. Hall Tobacco, in order to promote stage actors between the acts as well as the brand called Bravo Cigarettes.

He is famous for his role in the story of Syamantaka gem. He was the father of Satyabhama, who was Bhumidevi's incarnation and Sri Krishna's third wife.  Gaining the Syamantaka gem  Satrajit was a great devotee of lord Surya. He performed several offerings to him. One day, Satrajit was walking on a sea shore. Suddenly Surya appeared before him and told him that he was pleased with his devotion and gave him a gift. The gift was a radiant gem called Syamantaka. He told him that the gem would bring fortune and safety to his kingdom and provide him with wealth. Satrajit was delighted and went to his kingdom with the gem on his neck. He was shining like the sun god himself. People thought him to be the god. During a meeting, Krishna asked Satrajit to let Ugrasena borrow the gem as his kingdom was suffering from calamities and poverty. Satrajit refused and went back to his palace. Disappearance of the Gem One day, Satrajit's brother, Prasena, borrowed the gem from Satrajit and went into a forest for hunting. However a lion killed him and took the gem in its mouth and went inside a cave. The cave was of Jambavan, the immortal king of bears who played an important role in the Ramayana. Jambavan killed the lion and took the gem. Many days passed, Satrajit suspected that his brother must have been killed for the gem. He remembered Krishna's words during the meeting and he accused Krishna to be a thief. The rumour spread far and wide. Krishna, wanting to prove his innocence, started to investigate. Recovery and marriage of Satyabhama Krishna while investigating, found Satrajit's brother's dead body. Later he reached the cave of Jambavan. Krishna asked Jambavan to return the gem but Jambavan refused and challenged the lord of a fight. They fought for many days and Jambavan finally realised that Krishna was Rama's reincarnation. He asked for forgiveness to Krishna and offered the gem with his beautiful daughter Jambavati. Krishna accepted them and went to Satrajit. Krishna returned the gem to Satrajit, proving his accusations wrong. After Krishna left, Satrajit was ashamed of his act and started to think a way to ask forgiveness from Krishna. Satrajit got an idea and offered the gem along with his beautiful and powerful daughter Satyabhama. Krishna accepted Satyabhama as she was the future killer of Narakasura. But he refused to take the gem and went to Dwarka with his new wife. Death Kritavarma, Akrura and Satadhanwa were three Yadava warriors. They were captivated by the gem's glory and wanted it for themselves. One night when Satrajit was sleeping, they killed him and took the gem. Krishna and Balrama later avenged Satrajit's death by killing Satadhanwa.

The building is the headquarters of Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council. History From 1894, the Nuneaton Urban District Council (which became Nuneaton Borough Council in 1907 when Nuneaton became a municipal borough) had operated from offices in Queen's Road. By 1930 these had become too small to house the growing demand for municipal services, and so the council looked to construct a larger building. Land was purchased at the site on Coton Road for this purpose.Veasey, E.A. (2002), Nuneaton A History, Phillimore & Co. Limited, pages 104, 113-114, 126 . Buildings demolished on the site included the old Nuneaton Free Library and Clare Speight's photographic studios. The portico The building was designed by Peacock & Bewley of Birmingham in a restrained neoclassical style. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with 17 bays; a projecting central section included a large three-bay, two-storey, hexastyle composite order portico with a doorway surmounted by the borough coat of arms on the ground floor and three windows with entablature above on the first floor. A lantern was erected at roof level. Using mostly local materials, the construction works started in December 1931 and took two years to complete. The building was formally opened by the former local member of parliament, Sir Francis Newdegate, on 26 April 1934. The three storey building housed all of the council's departments, as well as well as the council chamber, committee rooms, and the mayor's parlour. The building was initially known as the \\"Council House\\", but was later renamed as the \\"Town Hall\\". Local government reorganisation in 1974 merged the Borough of Nuneaton with the urban district of Bedworth, and the Town Hall became the headquarters of the newly constituted Nuneaton and Bedworth Council. After the local electricity works, located just to the south of the town hall, had been demolished, a modern extension, which became known as the \\"Council House\\", was built in the 1980s to accommodate some of the council officers and their departments. In 2015, the town hall was identified as one of several buildings in the town which \\"convey messages of authority and civic pride\\". On 16 December 2019, a fire broke out in part of the building causing it to be evacuated. 30 firefighters from Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service were involved in tackling the fire, which was successfully contained to a small area of the upper floors and roof. An investigation showed that it had been started accidentally by workmen using a blowtorch while carrying out roof repairs.

There is a distinction between psychology, which treats authoritarianism as innate to the personality, and sociology, which considers authoritarianism a result of one's environment and posits that it may be influenced by factors such as religion. A longitudinal study of Americans born in the 1920s found that this effect held for traditional church-centered religion but not for those that are seeking non-institutional spirituality. The latter mode of religion is \\"characterized by an openness to new experiences and by creativity and experimentation, characteristics that are antithetical to the conventionality that adheres in authoritarianism\\". Specific cases Throughout history, authoritarian leaders have adopted different policies towards religion, from state atheism to drawing support from religion or co-opting religious leaders and institutions. As part of civil society, organized religion serves as a mediator between the state and citizens, even under authoritarian governments. In Russia, the Russian Orthodox Church enjoys a state monopoly and state subsidies, as well as a blasphemy law that protects it from criticism. Authoritarian leaders may fear that religion will be the source of political opposition, instability, or outright rebellion. Indeed, some scholars and political leaders, such as V√°clav Havel, have praised the role of religion in undermining authoritarian governments. However, in other cases, religions have engaged in alliances with the state, and religious institutions are not necessarily pockets of dissent or incubators of democracy. Unregistered or minority religions have been suppressed by state authoritarian regimes, such as house churches in China. In 1999, Falun Gong practitioners launched widespread protests against the Chinese government, which led to the persecution of Falun Gong.

An interpromotional show, it featured wrestlers from the American Wrestling Association, Jim Crockett Promotions and New Japan Pro Wrestling. Sixteen professional wrestling matches were set on the event's supercard. The main attraction on the event card was Ric Flair defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Siva Afi, which ended in a double disqualification. In the other main event, Antonio Inoki wrestled Bruiser Brody in a standard wrestling match. The undercard included Lars Anderson winning the NWA Polynesian Pacific Heavyweight Championship from Bad News Allen, defending NWA Polynesian Pacific Tag Team Champions The Soul Patrol (Rocky Johnson and Ricky Johnson) beating The Dirty White Boys (Len Denton and Tony Anthony), and The Family (Andr√© the Giant, Angelo Mosca and Steve Collins) defeating Sullivan's Army (King Kong Bundy, Mark Lewin and Kevin Sullivan) in a six-man tag team match. According to a pre-match stipulation, anyone who managed to bodyslam Bundy would win $20,000. The event had an attendance of between 12,553 and 19,955 people. It was the first show in Hawaii to gross over $100,000 and remained the state's highest- attended pro wrestling event during the 1980s wrestling boom. The record lasted for over 5 years until the WWF held a live event at the same venue in 1991. A second installment, A Hot Summers Night II, was held the following year but had a much smaller turnout due to a severe rainstorm. The failure of this second supercard, and a disastrous 1987 tour of California, is blamed for the promotion's close only three years later. Several matches from A Hot Summer Night were broadcast on the promotion's syndicated television program Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling and on TV Asahi for NJPW's World Pro Wrestling later that month. A number of these episodes were released on VHS and DVD in the early-2000s, however, the full show is not commercially available.

She was the subject of the \\"Great Convent Case\\" which found that she had been mistreated by her convent and that the church had failed to give her justice, Life Saurin was born in Duleek. Her parents were Brigid and Michael Saurin and they were landowners in Duleek in County Meath in Ireland. Four of Brigid and Michael's children opted for a religious life. A fifth child, Patrick, opted to become a lawyer. After two of her sisters decided to become nuns, her parents wanted Susan to choose a different life, but Susan insisted. In November 1850 Saurin made her commitment by joining a convent in Dublin where she was trained with Mary Starr and Julia Kennedy. The three of them adopted the names of Sister Scholastica, Sister Joseph and Sister Magdelen. Saurin's vows were accepted on 3 October 1853 and in 1856 the three of them were sent to found a new convent in Clifford in Yorkshire. Mary Starr (Joseph) was placed in charge with Julia Kennedy (Magdelen) as her assistant. In time the new convent would move to Hull. Mother Mary Starr (Joseph) and Saurin came into conflict. Starr was unhappy with many of the tasks that Saurin undertook and she accused her of breaking her vow of obedience because she would not tell her of conversations she had in the confessional or of letters that she had written including a letter asking her uncle to try and arrange her transfer to another convent. Starr was annoyed and turned to the Bishop to ask that he have Saurin evicted from the convent or she would resign. The Bishop had an obligation to oversee the convent. The Bishop of Beverley, Robert Cornthwaite had conflicting requests from Starr and Saurin's family who wanted him look at Saurin's treatment within the convent. Cornthwaite appointed five priests to investigate. They found \\"extraordinary and unexemplary severity\\" but only interviewed one of the nuns, Saurin. Individually the priests had doubts but their agreed advice was that Saurin should be obliged to leave the convent. Saurin refused and she believed that the Bishop lacked the power to intervene in her vows given at the convent. A caricature of Mother Starr in 1869 during the Great Convent Case For over a year she lived in the convent but was not part of the community. During this time a nun slept outside her room and she had was denied a fire or any books. Her treatment was leading to starvation and under medical advice and the legal advice of her brother (Patrick) she left the convent without ceremony or discussion with Starr or Kennedy. Nuns who leave convents can find that they lose all of their social standing. The \\"Great Convent Case\\" opened on 3 February 1869 at Westminster Hall with the Solicitor General William Digby Seymour representing Saurin and Queen's counsel representing Starr and Kennedy. Saurin was claiming ¬£5,000 in damages. Starr's portrait was caricatured by \\"Spy\\" and accompanied the story in Vanity Fair. Saurin accused Starr and Kennedy of lying to the Bishop of Beverley, assault and imprisonment. and the court heard of the Bishops enquiry which was held to be a \\"parody of justice\\". The Bishop was reprimanded for not not fixing the ‚Äúmiserable squabbles of a convent‚Äù and Starr was found to have misused Saurin's vow of obedience to inflict cruelty on her. Saurin was awarded fifty pounds in damages. The Daily Telegraph made a special publication on the \\"Inner Life of the Hull Nunnery Exposed\\" to cover the trial. Saurin died in Harrow on the Hill. She died as a nun as she had adopted the name of Mary Brown and joined a convent in Bristol.

Social tensions intensified at the end of the 16th century by the debilitation of the Ottoman administration, the chronic economic crisis, and arbitrary conduct of the Ottoman state authorities. The leaders of the uprising were initially successful and controlled several strategic locations and fortresses, especially in Epirus, Central Greece, and the Peloponnese. However the movement lacked the necessary organization. They were assisted by western powers; mainly by the Republic of Venice. Meanwhile the victory of the Holy League against the Ottoman fleet in the Battle of Lepanto, in November 1571, triggered further revolutionary activity. However, Venice withdrew its support to the Greek rebels and signed a unilateral peace with the Ottomans. As such the rebellion was doomed to end and the Ottoman forces committed a number of massacres in the aftermath of the revolt during the suppression of the uprising. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily isolated areas were still out of Ottoman control and new rebellions erupted, like that of Dionysios Skylosophos in 1611. Background Social tensions intensified by the debilitation of the Ottoman administration, as well as chronic economic crisis and arbitrary conduct of the Ottoman authorities. Under this context during the 16th century various Orthodox communities lost their social and economic privileges that had been formerly recognized by Ottoman decrees.Hasiotis, 2011, p. 439 Additionally, extensive imposition of extraordinary taxation by the Ottoman authorities in the Greek mainland and forced conscription to meet the increased demand of the Ottoman navy further deteriorated the situation. Instances of widespread destruction of churches and systematic plundering of religious property were also recorded in contemporary sources, both Greek and foreign. As a result of this kind of intensified oppression and arbitrary rule the local population hoped for a military intervention by a Christian power. Representatives of the Greek communities made several appeals for assistance against Ottoman rule.Brewer, 2012, p. 92 Activity in 1566 - March 1571 In Epirus the uprising begun at the end of 1566 in the coastal region of Himara. An Ottoman attempt to suppress the rebellion in September of that year failed. In the summer of 1567 the rebellion spread across several villages, while a siege attempt against the castle of Nivica on the Ionian Sea coast in January 1568 was initially unsuccessful.Kotzagoergis, 2008, p. 24 Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Mani Peninsula on the southern edge of the Peloponnese revolted in the autumn of 1567.Kotzagoergis, 2008, p. 23 The Maniot rebels received reinforcement by volunteers from Ioannina, who were landed there by a Spanish fleet. The Ottomans responded by dispatching a naval force to the coast of Epirus but the rebels managed to retreat inland and took advantage of the mountainous terrain. Additionally, in the summer of 1569, an Ottoman fortress was erected in a strategic location in Mani to monitor rebellious activity. After a short decline, the rebellion reached a new momentum and the newly erected fortress was captured in the summer of 1570 with the support of a Venetian force. Following the outbreak of the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War in 1570, Venetian units also assisted the revolutionaries in Himara in the capture of the castle of Sopot on the Ionian Sea coast after a two-month siege in June 1570. The uprising spread to various parts of Epirus under Emmanuel Mormoris, with the guidance of local Greek nobles and various Stratioti military leaders such as Petros Lantzas. The castle of Nivica was also taken in March 1571. Battle of Lepanto and aftermatch The Battle of Lepanto of 1571, by Andries van Eertvelt The Battle of Lepanto took place off the coast of Patras in the Ionian Sea on 10-14 November 1571. A significant number of Greeks participated in the conflict on the side of the Holy League, while three Venetian galleys were commanded by Greek captains. Historian George Finlay (1877) stated with a certain decree of exaggeration that over 25,000 Greeks fought for the Holy League, while additionally 5,000 were in the Ottoman side. He concluded that their numbers \\"far exceeded that of the combatants of any of the nations engaged\\". The Battle of Lepanto resulted in the defeat of the Ottoman fleet by the Holy League. As a result Greek-Venetian activities reached a new momentum and the leaders of the Orthodox Greek communities continued to invest their resources and energy for the purpose of uprooting Ottoman rule. News of the Christian victory spread immediately in the nearby region of Patras where the inhabitants rejoiced in the destruction of the Ottoman fleet. The local metropolitan bishop, Germanos, and the local nobility joined the movement. Soon after armed units were formed and expelled the Ottoman garrison. Meanwhile, some Ottoman crews that managed to flee from the victorious Christian fleet landed on the nearby coast of Peloponnese and were annihilated by the insurgents.Tsiknakis, 2005, p. 225 The rebellion was soon spread to nearby regions in the Peloponnese and central Greece, namely Aigio, Galaxidi, and Salona.Tsiknakis, 2005, p. 226 In Epirus, the combined Greek-Venetian force was again successful at the siege of Margariti .Hasiotis, 1970, p. 193: \\"ŒøŒπ ŒàŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÇ ŒµŒ∫ŒªŒÆŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ±ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄŒ¨ŒªŒπ ŒΩŒ± œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±œÉœÑŒøœçŒΩ ŒºŒµ œÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒíŒµŒΩŒµœÑŒøœçœÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÄŒøŒπŒÆœÉŒ∑ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¥ŒµœçœÑŒµœÅŒ∑œÇ œÄŒøŒªŒπŒøœÅŒ∫ŒØŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒ±œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒπœÑŒØŒøœÖ œÄŒøœÖ Œ≠Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒµ Œ±ŒºŒ≠œÉœâœÇ ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ œÑŒ∑ ŒΩŒ±œÖŒºŒ±œáŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒùŒ±œÖœÄŒ¨Œ∫œÑŒøœÖ (œÉœÑŒπœÇ 10-14 ŒùŒøŒµŒºŒ≤œÅŒØŒøœÖ 1571)... \\"¬´œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ¨œÇ¬ª œÉœÑŒ± œÄŒµœÅŒØœáœâœÅŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒ±œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒπœÑŒπŒøœã Œ∫Œ±ŒØ, œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ, ŒµŒæŒ±œÉœÜŒ¨ŒªŒπœÉŒµ œÑŒ∑ œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±œÉŒØŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøŒØŒ∫œâŒΩ œÑœâŒΩ Œ≥ŒµŒπœÑŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ œáœâœÅŒπœéŒΩ \\" As a result a region stretching from Argyrokastron down to Parga came under rebel control. Among the revolutionary leaders, the Stratioti Georgios Renesis became active in Lefkada and Arta. Moreover, representatives of Ioannina and the surrounding region initiated secret communications with the Venetians to overthrow their local Ottoman authorities. 1571-1572 Large-scale unrest occurred in additional parts of the Ottoman Empire; in the islands of Aegina and Lefkada the Christian inhabitants rose in revolt, while in Naxos they declined to pay the jizya tax owed by the Christian subjects of the Empire. However, in 1572 it became apparent that the Venetians were about to sign a peace treaty with the Ottomans. As a result, the Greeks that had cooperated with the Venetians turned to the Kingdom of Naples, then part of the Spanish Empire, for support. The rebels in Mani approached the Spanish, while others, such as Manthos Papagiannis and Panos Kestolikos, visited Don Juan, commander-in-chief of the Holly Alliance.Giakoumis, 2002, p. 22 Additionally, the metropolitan bishop of Monemvasia, Makarios Melissenos, and his brother, Theodore, initiated negotiations with both the Spanish and the Venetians. During April 1572 the rebellion was still active in parts of Mani and Monemvasia. The Ottomans sent a large army as well as naval forces which attacked the rebellious provinces and compelled Emmanuel Mormoris to retreat to the castle of Sopot, where he was later arrested.Giakoumis, 2002, p. 19 In October 1572 an attempt by Spain to land reinforcements in the coastal towns of Pylos and Modon failed. Suppression As a result of the Venetian withdrawal from the region the rebellion was doomed to end. Venice finally decided to sign a unilateral peace with the Ottomans in 1573.Hasiotis, 1975, p. 285 On the other hand, Spain continued to encourage insurrections against the Ottoman Empire and acceded to the petitions of various rebels and potential rebels.Lubin, 2012, p. 165 However, due to bad organization the uprising was finally suppressed and most of the leaders were executed by the Ottomans. Ottoman suppression was harsh in Patras and the city became almost deserted in the following years.Tsiknakis, 2005, p. 234 Among those executed were several nobles, among them metropolitan bishop Germanos, and the local nobility were mutilated.Tsiknakis, 2005, p. 228 In Ioannina the Ottoman governor proposed the expulsion of the entire Christian community from the castle and their replacement with Muslim settlers.Kotzagoergis, 2008, p. 24 As a result during the last quarter of the 16th century Greek refugees fled to nearby Venetian-controlled areas, in particular the Ionian islands.

Background  This set of folksongs was finished in 1929, after several years of collecting and arranging folksongs, most of which were published in a book published in 1924 entitled A magyar n√©pdal (The Hungarian Folk Song). This included most of the raw material that he worked on in many other different pieces that were also based on folk material. This was Bart√≥k's last set of songs based on folk tunes and was put together in a seemingly random fashion, as they were grouped loosely into different categories, but not according to the date of composition of the individual pieces. However, he wrote the last five songs of the set in an uninterrupted movement. The cycle was first performed by Maria Basilides, who also premiered the arrangement for orchestra, and Bart√≥k at the piano, on January 30, 1930, in Budapest. It was published by Universal Edition in 1932 and again by Hawkes & Son in 1939.  Structure  This song cycle is divided into four books of unequal length, containing a total of sixteen movements, and takes more than half an hour to perform. It is scored for unspecified voice (commonly performed by a soprano or a mezzo-soprano) and piano. Bart√≥k wrote the duration and metronome indications for each song, which was common in some of Bart√≥k's works. According to Bart√≥k himself, these were not meant to be taken exactly as written, but they are meant to serve \\"only as a guide for the executants\\". The movement list is as follows: * Book I: Szomor√∫ n√≥t√°k (Sad Songs) ** I. A t√∂ml√∂cben (In Prison). Lento, parlando ** II. R√©gi keserves (Old Lament). Non troppo lento, parlando ** III. Bujdos√≥ √©nek (The Fugitive). Andante, parlando ** IV. P√°sztorn√≥ta (Herdsman‚Äôs Song). Andante, parlando * Book II: T√°ncdalok (Dancing Songs) ** V. Sz√©kely ‚Äûlass√∫‚Äù (Sz√©kely Slow Dance). Maestoso ** VI. Sz√©kely ‚Äûfriss‚Äù (Sz√©kely Fast Dance). Allegro ** VII. Kan√°szt√°nc (Swineherd‚Äôs Dance). Allegro ** VIII. ‚ÄûHatforintos‚Äù n√≥ta (Six-Florin Dance). Allegro * Book III: Vegyes dalok (Diverse Songs) ** IX. Juh√°szcs√∫fol√≥ [The Shepherd). Andante ** X. Tr√©f√°s n√≥ta (Joking Song). Allegro ** XI. P√°ros√≠t√≥ (1) (Nuptial Serenade 1). Moderato, scherzando ** XII. P√°ros√≠t√≥ (2) (Nuptial Serenade 2). Allegro ** XIII. P√°r-√©nek (Dialogue Song). Adagio non troppo ** XIV. Panasz (Lament). Andante ** XV. Bordal (Drinking Song). Non troppo vivo * Book IV: √öj dalok (New Style Songs) ** XVI *** I. Allegro (\\"Hej, √©desany√°m\\") *** II. Pi√π allegro (\\"√ârik a ropog√≥s cseresznye\\") *** III. Moderato (\\"M√°r Dobozon r√©gen leesett a h√≥\\") *** IV. Allegretto (\\"S√°rga kukoricasz√°r\\") *** V. Allegro non troppo (\\"B√∫za, b√∫za, b√∫za\\") The last book from this set has only one untitled movement, which, in turn, contains five different songs joined attacca, thus turning it into a continuous musical texture with connecting piano passages. According to professor Michael Hicks, Bart√≥k did not merely arranged folk music, but he rather re-composed the pieces and used repetitions, transpositions, texture economy and narrative building, which helped him \\"reach his ideal of making high art from the folksong of his homeland\\". The lyrics were written in Bart√≥k's native Hungarian. However, they were translated into German for their latest edition. Book I was translated by Benedikt Szabolcsi and Books II to IV by Rudolf Stefan Hoffmann.  Arrangements  Bart√≥k himself also published an arrangement for voice and orchestra of songs 1, 2, 11, 14, and 12. It was entitled Five Hungarian Folksongs, Sz. 101, BB 108, and was published some years later, in 1933, to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra.

He was born in Bangkok, Thailand. He graduated a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Political Science (International Relations) Chulalongkorn University, and doctorate in Political Studies from SOAS University of London. He worked as a diplomat in Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for thirteen years, then as a political science academic, and he is currently a professor at Kyoto University, where he is editor-in-chief of its Center for Southeast Asian Studies' Kyoto Review of Southeast Asia.. He is the author of several books including \\"A Plastic Nation: The Curse of Thainess in Thai-Burmese Relations\\" (2005), and \\"Reinventing Thailand: Thaksin and His Foreign Policy\\" (2010). He is a well known critic of the state of Thai monarchy and Thai politics, regularly gives lecture and writes articles, books and opinion editorials on the topics, for outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and the South China Morning Post. He supported reforms of the monarchy and the country's l√®se majest√© law. In 2011, he launched a campaign to free a political prisoner, Ak Kong, who was charged with l√®se majest√© for allegedly sending text messages which insulted the monarchy to an unknown person https://www.newmandala.org/thailands-fearlessness-free-akong/. After the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat, the junta ordered him to turn himself in, but he refused and even mocked the summons by asking if he could send his pet chihuahua to meet with junta leader General Prayut Chan-o-cha in his stead. On 13 June 2014, the NCPO issued an arrest warrant against Pavin, and he has lived in exile ever since. His current residence is in Kyoto, Japan. In July, 2019, he was apparently assaulted near his residence, in an incident allegedly linked to the Thai authorities. In 2020, he launched a Facebook page \\"The Royalists Marketplace\\" as a forum to discuss and criticize the Thai monarchy freely. The Thai authorities successfully took action to shut down access to the Facebook page, which has accumulated around one million users, and which Facebook may be appealing, while Pavin is facing a charge of cybercrime. He has since launched a replacement Facebook page \\"The Royalists Marketplace-Taland Luang\\". https://www.facebook.com/groups/634791290746287.

The building was constructed in about 1500. It is a wealden hall house, which by the date was a common design in South East England, but rare in York. The Wealden Hall and 1 Tanner Row, also in the city, are the two northernmost surviving examples of wealden halls. Using the standard wealden hall design, the building originally had a central hall, with double storey bays either side. In this case, the design was end-on to the street, and, unusually, only the front bays were jettied. In front of the hall, a three-storey range was constructed to face the street. Remain of two windows survive from the original construction, although they were originally unglazed and probably closed with shutters. The rear never had any openings, suggesting that it may have directly abutted another structure. The size of the house, and its jettying, suggests that it was built for a wealthy owner. From the 16th-century on, many alterations were made to the building: new walls and chimneys were added, attics were constructed, and a first floor was inserted into the hall. The front of the building was plastered, probably in 1700, a date which is now inscribed on the front of the building. The eastern part of the front range became a separate building, now the Snickleway Inn. In 1930, the building was bought by Cuthbert Morrell, for restoration, which was conducted by the architect Harvey Rutherford. Among other changes, he restored the hall to its former dimensions, and removed the plaster from the street front, to reveal the timber framing. The building now belongs to the York Conservation Trust and houses shops, with offices above. It has also been used for exhibitions, like one in 2012 focusing on the culture of homelessness in the city.

Background The Flavivirus positive-oriented, single- stranded RNA genome has a length of 10,000 - 11,000 bases. The genus includes human pathogens like Zika virus, West-Nile virus, Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus and other. The 5' UTR of flaviviruses are highly structured, has a length of approximately 100 nucleotides and harbors two conserved RNA secondary structures which are vital for the viral life cycle. During replication, the 5' UTR interacts with the 3' UTR of the genome to initiate synthesis of new viral replicates and viral protein translation. In direct adjacency to the 5' UTR lies the cHP structure, which is essential for the viral replication.  5'SLA  The first structural element is termed 5'SLA and comprises three stems (S1, S2, S3) folded as Y-shaped-like stem structure, and a side structure domain (SSD). Its overall length is around 70 nucleotides. Disruption experiments of S1 and S2 led to a stop of viral replication. Further, SLA is the promoter for RNA synthesis and interacts with the viral protein NS5 during circularization of the viral genome. After recruitment of NS5, the two loop regions of S3 (TL) and SSD (SSL) are considered to interact with NS5 to promote polymerase activity. Despite the diversity of SSD, its stable structure is essential for infectivity.  5'SLB  The second element is termed 5'SLB and contains the translation initiation codon at the top region of the stem loop. It further contains the 5'UAR (upstream AUG region), which is essential for the circularization of the genome. The 5'UAR interacts with the 3'UAR, which is located at the 3' UTR of the genome to form a long-range RNA-RNA interaction.  cHP  The capsid- coding hairpin region (cHP) actually lies in the ORF of the viral genome and is followed by the 5'CS (conserved sequence), which forms another long-range RNA-RNA interaction with the 3' UTR (3'CS). The cHP aids in the start codon recognition and viral replication. Studies show that the function of cHP is sequence-independent but structure-dependent.

Background The Flavivirus positive-oriented, single- stranded RNA genome has a length of 10,000 - 11,000 bases. The genus includes human pathogens like Zika virus, West-Nile virus, Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus and other. The 3' UTR ranges between 400 and 700 nucleotides in length. Its RNA secondary structure is known to be necessary for the viral replication during infection. In contrast to the structurally conserved 5' UTR of flaviviruses, individual structural elements differ between different viruses, which is associated with the host-adaptation. Flaviviruses are therefore classified into four different groups: Mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFV), tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV), insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFV) and those with no known vector (NKV). Across all groups, three RNA secondary structure elements are conserved within the 3' UTR: the dumbbell element (DB), cis- acting replication element (CRE) and the exoribonuclease-resistant RNA elements (xrRNA). Further, unique elements have been observed for specific groups as well.  Subgenomic flavivirus RNA  The 3' UTR of flavivirus - and sometimes even a small part of the 3' end of the coding region - is also called subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). Is has been shown that sfRNA is implied in many different pathways that comprises both, host defenses and viral infection. SfRNA is produced by incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the host cell (via XRN1). Local RNA secondary structures (xrRNA elements) in the 3' UTR and long-range RNA-RNA interactions between 5' UTR and 3' UTR of flaviviruses stall XRN1 and causes the undigested fragment of the genome.  xrRNA element  The exoribonuclease-resistant RNA elements (xrRNA) are described throughout all groups of flaviviruses. Usually, each virus harbors two xrRNAs, xrRNA1 and xrRNA2, in the beginning of the 3' UTR. The formation of these stem-loops, especially xrRNA1, is vital to ensure resistance against XRN1 activity. The Y-shaped stem-loop is also termed SL II and SL IV, respectively. In order to function as xrRNA, the sequence downstream is needed as well, since the upper loop region forms a pseudoknot (PK) with the single-stranded region directly downstream to its respective hairpin. In some species, the region downstream also forms a small hairpin. In such cases, the PK interactions takes place between the two loop regions. Conserved formation of these structures were observed in mammalian cells but not in mosquito cells, suggesting this region has varying functions in different hosts. In plant-viruses, xrRNA elements have been observed as well, showing some similarities to flaviviral xrRNAs. However, plant-virus xrRNA and flaviviral xrRNA are distinguishable by their underlying three-dimensional folds.  Dumbbell element  The dumbbell element (DB) are important for viral RNA synthesis. Via the formation of additional pseudoknots, the loop regions of DB pairs with a complementary motif further downstream of the respective DB element. The DB elements also expose conserved sequences (CS) and repeated conserved sequences (RCS). Further, the DB elements are also playing a role in viral translation, as deletion of both elements reduced viral translation levels.  CRE structure  The cis-acting replication element (CRE) structure is structurally conserved among known flaviviruses. It consists of a small hairpin (sHP) and a larger structural element (3'SL). Mutations of sHP are shown to be lethal for Dengue virus in mosquito cells. CRE is highly involved in the 5'-3' UTR interaction of flaviviruses. Regions of sHP are interacting with the SLB element and the cHP in the 5' UTR, whereas the 3'SL harbors a sequence that can interact with SLB, to further stabilize this long-range RNA-RNA interaction.  Repeated elements  In ISFV, structural alignments of the 3' UTR revealed that many species harbor three to four repeats of two highly conserved elements, termed Ra and Rb. These elements show variable loop regions and low sequence conservation in the Ra element. However, strong structure conservation and the occurrence of multiple copies may hint towards a possible functional importance of these elements.  SL6 short hairpin  In different studies, a short stem-loop, named SL6 has been observed in at least TBEV, LGTV and OHFV. SL6 shows a high heterogeneity among different tick-borne flaviviruses, but is structurally conserved supported by multiple covariation.

Some of the derailed wagons caught fire, leading to an evacuation of people living nearby. Accident At about 23:15 BST (22:15 UTC), the 6A11 21:52 Robeston Sidings (Milford Haven) - Theale freight train derailed and caught fire at Morlais Junction, near Llangennech, Carmarthenshire. The train, operated by DB Cargo, comprised a Class 60 locomotive 60062 Stainless Pioneer and 25 tank wagons, each carrying up to 100 tonnes of diesel of gas oil. The third to twelfth wagons derailed. The train was travelling at at the time of the derailment. There were no injuries reported amongst the two train crew. Following the accident, the locomotive and first two wagons stopped from the burning wreckage. The locomotive was uncoupled from the wagons and moved to safety. Class 66 locomotive 66004 moved the wagons at the tail of the train away from the scene of the fire. A large number of emergency services and local authority personnel attended the scene. The British Transport Police, Dyfed- Powys Police, Carmarthenshire County Council, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service and Natural Resources Wales all sent personnel. Fourteen fire appliances, a foam tender and a high pressure pump attended the fire, which was expected to burn for several days. By the evening of 27 August, six of the appliances had been withdrawn. The fire was extinguised at 08:30 on 28 August, having burnt for 33 hours. Control of the site was then handed over to the British Transport Police (BTP) and Network Rail (NR). Once BTP had established that the derailment was accidental, they passed control to the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). Dyfed-Powys Police set up a radius exclusion zone, and about 300 local residents were evacuated from their homes. They were later allowed to return. The railway between and was closed. Buses were laid on to replace passenger trains between those stations, with journey taking more than 6 hours. The A4138 road was closed, to be reopened by midday, and the B4297 was also closed. Local road disruption was expected to last for several days. This was the first major accident involving a tanker train fire in the United Kingdom since the Summit Tunnel fire on 20 December 1984, and the second derailment and fire in two weeks, following the Stonehaven derailment. The derailment destroyed track over a distance of and also destroyed signalling cables in the area. On 6 September, it was claimed by Member of the Senedd and Deputy Transport Minister Lee Waters that the railway could be closed until December 2020. NR subsequently said the line would be closed until January 2021. Natural Resources Wales said a significant volume of diesel had been spilled. Some flowing into the River Loughor, the estuary of which is a designated SSSI and a wildlife conservation area. Work to contain the spill commenced on 28 August. Local cockle and other shellfish picking was suspended following the spill on advice from the Food Standards Agency. By 1 September, diesel had spread as far as Crofty, Glamorgan, about from the site of the derailment. The undamaged wagons were removed from the site on 31 August. Those at the front of the train were taken to Margam, whilst those at the rear were taken to Llandeilo Junction. Work to recover the derailed wagons started on 1 September, with the aim of recovering two wagons a day. Two of the derailed wagons were cut up in situ. The rest were lifted by a rail crane and removed by road, with the last wagon being removed on 8 September. Investigations The BTP, ORR and Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) opened investigations into the accident. The BTP ruled out criminal activity as a cause of the derailment. The damaged wheel, with flat spot and false flange. Note that the wagon is on its side. On 21 September 2020, the RAIB released an update about their investigation. It had been found that at some point on the journey, the brakes on the third wagon had become applied. The leading axle of the front bogie had seized, causing a flat spot to develop on one of the wheels, along with a false flange. As the train traversed a set of points, the wheel distorted the track under the train, causing the derailment. On 30 October 2017, the brakes on a wagon of a tanker train from Robeston had seized causing a severe flat spot, before the axle became free again. Track between Carmarthen Junction and the Llangyfelach Tunnel, a distance of , was severely damaged.

Director Michael Kirk intended for the film to highlight the irony in Obama's promise to unify the country, \\"that by the end of his presidency -- he freely admitted and everyone else could see -- that the division was even deeper, even broader, that racism was even more rampant.\\" A preview of the documentary was released on January 6, 2020. Release America's Great Divide first aired on PBS in the United States on January 13 and 14, 2020. On the same day of the broadcast of \\"Part 2\\", both parts of the documentary film were made available by Frontline for streaming on YouTube without charge. Critical response Brian Lowery of CNN praised America's Great Divide for \\"admirably\\" charting in detail the deepening division within the United States through the presidencies of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, stating that \\"The sobering takeaway from 'America's Great Divide,' explored at some length in the second half, is whether the nastiness that defines current political discourse is irrevocable. John Doyle of the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail also commended the documentary for its compelling presentation of the \\"central threads\\" which lead to the election of Trump, stating that it is \\"sobering, at times unnerving and often startling.\\" ReferencesExternal links * PBS official site * Part 1 on IMDb * Part 2 on IMDb Category:2020 films Category:2020 television films Category:2020 documentary films Category:American films Category:American television films Category:Documentary films about elections in the United States Category:Documentary films about Presidents of the United States Category:Documentary films about the media Category:English-language films Category:Films about Barack Obama Category:Films about disinformation Category:Films about Donald Trump Category:Frontline (American TV program) Category:PBS original programming ","title":"America's Great Divide"},{"id":"65091599","text":" People (given name)  * Jeevitha is an Indian actress concentrating on Tamil and Telugu languages of Indian film industry.

Life=Early life and education He was born Hans Christian Viggo Hansen on 31 March 1859 in Copenhagen, the son of master brazier Peter Christian Hansen (1824‚Äì97) and Sara Marie Henriette Andersen (1824-84). He completed a brazier's apprenticeship in 1879 but had aspirations to become a painter. He, therefore, received preparatory training in painting under C. F. Andersen before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for three quarters of a year in 1882-83. Career He had his debut at the Charlottenborg Exhibition in 1885‚Äì86 with two paintings, A View of Christianshavns Kanal and A View of Copenhagen Harbour from Nyb√∏rs, but a visual impairment then forced him to give up painting. He then returned to his old trade, concentrating on executing sculptural works in hammered metals, both from his own designs and those of other artists. Viggo-Hansen also created baptismal dishes in silver, tin and iron for a number of churches. A selection of these were featured on the Society of Decorative Art's exhibition in February‚ÄìMarch 1903. This brought him in contact with H. A. Gruberts S√∏nners Metalvarefabrik where he served as artistic director for many years. Last years He went on study trips to Germany, Austria and Italy on grants from the Larssenske Legat and the Reiersen Foundation. Late in his life, he returned to painting, spending several summers on Bornholm painting seascapes. He died on 6 October 1930 and is buried in Bispebjerg Cemetery. Works Absalon, Copenhagen City Hall, Copenhagen The Bell Strikers The Thor sculpture on the roof He was charged with executing Vilhelm Bissen's Absalon statue for the new Copenhagen City Hall- It was awarded a gold medal on the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. Vigo-Gansen was also responsible for creating other metalwork for the new city hall, including the coat of arms on the facade. Carl Jacobsen charged him with a number of prominent commissions for his many building projects, including Thor med sine bukke (by Carl Johan Bonnesen) for the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse, the Bell-Strikers (based on a small sketch by Stephan Sinding) on the Dipylon Building and the angel for the spire of the Jesus Church and dragon ornaments for his own house (Viggo-Hansen's design). Other works by Viggo-Hansen include the roof-top figure on Det Ny Teater (designed in collaboration with Jens Jacob Bregn√∏) and the fish on the Caritas Gountain in Gammeltorv were also created by Viggo-Hansen.

After he was released on parole for a double murder, he proceeded to murder two other women in a few days, but was quickly recaptured. For his new crimes, he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Early life Little is known about Bolgarov's early life. Born and raised in Gagarin, he studied up until the 9th grade, after which he quit school due to his poor performance. He never got a job and lived with his parents. At the age of 16, he murdered two women and was imprisoned for the crime for several years. In April 2010, Vasily was released on parole and settled in Gagarin with a woman he had met while still in jail. The couple lived by modest means, with most of their income supplied by a cousin of Bolgarov who worked in the United States. Although described as hot-tempered, Vasily's girlfriend claimed that he was never violent, and was a kind and cheerful man, known by his affectionate name \\"Kot\\". Unbeknownst to her, he contacted various girls on Odnoklassniki using various pseudonyms, whom he would ask out on dates. Two women would respond to his offers, and they would later become his murder victims. Evgenia Shamruk The first woman to respond to Bolgarov was 30-year-old Evgenia Shamruk, a Gagarin local. She was a gradu√©e of the Institute of Arts who worked at a library, and was looking for a boyfriend online. The two began communicating often via Skype, and later on, they exchanged mobile numbers. On July 8, 2010, Evgenia invited Vasily over to her house. He came dressed up in a nice suit and with a bouquet of flowers, at first knocking on the wrong apartment before finding Shamruk's. The pair then went on a walk around the city, before they returned to Bolgarov's house, where they chatted and drank wine. Around midnight, he offered to escort her back to her house, which Evgenia accepted. At the house, while searching the cupboards for some tea, Bolgarov noticed a nylon cord on one of the shelves. He then grabbed Shamruk and tied her up, moving her to a nearby closet, where he subsequently strangled her. After reassuring himself that she was dead, he stole her purse, jewelry, mobile phone and the recently-gifted bouquet, then set fire to a sofa and armchair with a flammable liquid. While the apartment was burning down, he calmly left the house, emptied the purse containing 2,000 rubles and threw it beside the road. Bolgarov then went to a pawn shop, where he sold Shamruk's phone for 700 rubles, but decided to keep her bracelet. Returning home, he immediately went back to making appointments with girls, and not long after, another woman contacted him. Anastasia Lukyanova The second victim was a 21-year-old college student and cook named Anastasia \\"Nastya\\" Lukyanova, who lived in Smolensk. Kind and shy, but gullible and insecure about her weight, Nastya was desperately looking for somebody who could love her for being herself, finding that dream man in the form of \\"Andrei\\", a programmer who lived in Gagarin. During this time, her relatives and colleagues noticed that she had fallen in love with a man she had met, but curiously, as per his request, she never showed any pictures of him. Using the fact that her parents weren't in the house and that her grandmother lived in the countryside, Nastya invited her supposed lover over to Smolensk on July 14th. He came over in the evening and they went to her room, where they talked for about 20 minutes before \\"Andrei\\" started asking her for money. Replying that she had none, Bolgarov then grabbed a belt from one of her clothes and strangled Lukyanova on the spot. He then rummaged through the house, stealing every valuable item he could find, including a phone, a camera and some gold, but ultimately failing to locate any money. Vasily then called a taxi and was driven to Gagarin, leaving behind the driver a tip of 500 rubles. Arrest, trial and imprisonment By the time Lukyanova's body was recovered, there were growing fears that a serial killer was in the area. Authorities interviewed numerous witnesses, including Shamruk's next-door neighbor and the taxi driver, both of whom had seen a suspicious young man accompanying the girls. Not long after, they arrived at Bolgarov's doorstep, and arrested him on charges of killing Evgenia and Nastya. Knowing that admitting his guilt would give him a more lenient sentence, Vasily readily confessed to the murders. The court convicted him of both murders, and taking into the mitigating circumstances, he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, the first 8 of which he would spent in a normal prison and the rest in a maximum security prison colony. In addition, he was ordered to pay 219 thousand rubles in material damages to the victims' families. The parents of the victims protested the sentence, going so far as to petition then-President Dmitry Medvedev to lift the moratorium on the death penalty, but their request went unanswered.

It is a part of the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement, and was initially triggered by the killing of George Floyd during his arrest by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. Following the death of George Floyd, unrest broke out in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area on May 26, and quickly spread across the entire United States. Within Minneapolis, widespread property destruction and looting occurred, including a police station being overrun by demonstrators and set on fire, leading to the Minnesota National Guard to be activated and deployed on May 28. After a week of unrest, over $500 million in property damage was reported in the Minneapolis‚ÄîSaint Paul area. Further unrest quickly spread throughout the United States, sometimes including rioting, looting, and arson. By early June, at least 200 American cities had imposed curfews, while more than 30 states and Washington, D.C, had activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel in response to unrest. By the end of June, at least 14,000 people had been arrested at protests. Polls have estimated that between 15 million and 26 million people had participated at some point in the demonstrations in the United States, making them the largest protests in United States history. It was also estimated that between May 26 and August 22, around 93% of protests were \\"peaceful and nondestructive\\". Still, arson, vandalism and looting caused about $1-$2 billion in insured damage between May 26 and June 8 (according to a September 2020 estimate), making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history. There has also been a large concentration of unrest around Portland, Oregon, which has led to the Department of Homeland Security deploying federal agents in the city from June onwards. The move was code named Operation Legend, after 4 year old LeGend Taliferro, who was shot and killed in Kansas City. Federal forces have since also been deployed in other cities which have faced large amounts of unrest, including Kansas City and Seattle. More localized unrest reemerged in several cities following incidents involving police officers, notably following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, which led to protests and riots in the city. The protests have led to requests at the federal, state and municipal levels intended to combat police misconduct, systemic racism, qualified immunity and police brutality in the United States. A wave of monument removals and name changes has taken place throughout the world, especially in the United States. This itself has sparked conflict, between left-wing and right-wing groups, often violent. Groups such as antifa and the Three Percenters have fought each other in street clashes. The racial unrest precipitated a national American cultural reckoning on topics of racial injustice. Public opinion of racism and discrimination quickly shifted in the wake of the protests, with significantly increased support of the Black Lives Matter movement and acknowledgement of institutional racism, i.e. systemic advantages and disadvantages due to race. Demonstrators revived a public campaign for the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials as well as other historic symbols such as statues of venerated American slaveholders and modern display of the Confederate battle flag. Public backlash widened to other institutional symbols, including place names, namesakes, brands and cultural practices. Anti-racist self-education became a trend throughout June 2020 in the United States. Black anti-racist writers found new audiences and places on bestseller lists. American consumers also sought out Black-owned businesses to support. The effects of American activism extended internationally, as global protests destroyed their own local symbols of racial injustice. Multiple media began to refer to it as a national reckoning on racial issues in early June. By the beginning of July, The Washington Post was running a regularly-updated section collecting new stories of the day related to \\"America's Racial Reckoning\\".  Background = Allegations of police brutality in the United States  Frequent cases of police misconduct and fatal use of force by law enforcement officers in the U.S., particularly against African Americans, have long led the civil rights movement and other activists to protest against the lack of police accountability in incidents involving excessive force. Many protests during the civil rights movement were a response to police brutality, including the 1965 Watts riots which resulted in the deaths of 34 people, mostly African Americans. The largest post-civil rights movement protest in the 20th Century was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were in response to the acquittal of police officers responsible for excessive force against Rodney King, an African American man. In 2014, the shooting of Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri resulted in local protests and unrest while the death of Eric Garner in New York City resulted in numerous national protests. After Eric Garner and George Floyd repeatedly said \\"I can't breathe\\" during their arrests, the phrase became a protest slogan against police brutality. In 2015 the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore police custody resulted in riots in the city and nationwide protests as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. Several nationally publicized incidents occurred in Minnesota, including the 2015 shooting of Jamar Clark in Minneapolis; the 2016 shooting of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights; and the 2017 shooting of Justine Damond. In 2016, Tony Timpa was killed by Dallas police officers in the same way as George Floyd. In March 2020, the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor by police executing a no knock warrant at her Kentucky apartment was also widely publicized. According to the Washington Post database of every fatal shooting by an on- duty police officer in the United States, as of August 31, 2020, 9 unarmed black people had been shot by police in 2020. As of that date the database lists four people of unknown race, 11 white people, 3 Hispanic people, and 1 person of \\"other\\" race who were shot while unarmed. Black people, who account for less than 13% of the American population, are killed by police at a disproportionate rate, being killed at more than twice the rate of white people. According to a data set and analysis which was released by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) at the beginning of September, there were more than 10,600 demonstration events across the country between May 24 and August 22 which were associated with all causes: Black Lives Matter, counter-protests, COVID-19-pandemic-related protests, and others. After Floyd's killing, Black Lives Matter related protests sharply peaked in number at the end of May, declining to dozens per week by September, and are characterized as \\"an overwhelmingly peaceful movement\\" with more than 93% of protests involving no incidents of violence nor destructive activity. The protests that took place in 140 U.S. cities this spring were mostly peaceful, but the arson, vandalism and looting that did occur will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims. The unrest this year (from May 26 to June 8) will cost the insurance industry far more than any prior incidents of social unrest.  Shooting of Breonna Taylor  Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison, and Myles Cosgrove on March 13, 2020. Three plainclothes LMPD officers entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, executing a search warrant. Gunfire was exchanged between Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker and the officers. Walker said that he believed that the officers were intruders. The LMPD officers fired over twenty shots. Taylor was shot eight times and LMPD Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly was injured by gunfire. Another police officer and an LMPD lieutenant were on the scene when the warrant was executed.Darcy Costello & Tessa Duvall, Who are the 3 Louisville officers involved in the Breonna Taylor shooting? What we know, Louisville Courier Journal (May 16, 2020; updated June 20, 2020). The primary targets of the LMPD investigation were Jamarcus Glover and Adrian Walker, who were suspected of selling controlled substances from a drug house more than 10 miles away. According to a Taylor family attorney, Glover had dated Taylor two years before and continued to have a \\"passive friendship\\". The search warrant included Taylor's residence because it was suspected that Glover received packages containing drugs at Taylor's apartment and because a car registered to Taylor had been seen parked on several occasions in front of Glover's house. Kenneth Walker, who was licensed to carry a firearm, fired first, injuring a law enforcement officer, whereupon police returned fire into the apartment with more than 20 rounds. A wrongful death lawsuit filed against the police by the Taylor family's attorney alleges that the officers, who entered Taylor's home \\"without knocking and without announcing themselves as police officers\\", opened fire \\"with a total disregard for the value of human life;\\" however, according to the police account, the officers did knock and announce themselves before forcing entry. Protests, over the shooting, occurred from May 26, alongside protests over the killing of George Floyd.  Killing of George Floyd  According to a police statement, on May 25, 2020, at 8:08p.m. CDT, Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officers responded to a 9-1-1 call regarding a \\"forgery in progress\\" on Chicago Avenue South in Powderhorn, Minneapolis. MPD Officers Thomas K. Lane and J. Alexander Kueng arrived with their body cameras turned on. A store employee told officers that the man was in a nearby car. Officers approached the car and ordered George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, who according to police \\"appeared to be under the influence\\", to exit the vehicle, at which point he \\"physically resisted\\". According to the MPD, officers \\"were able to get the suspect into handcuffs, and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance.\\" Once Floyd was handcuffed, he and Officer Lane walked to the sidewalk. Floyd sat on the ground at Officer Lane's direction. In a short conversation, the officer asked Floyd for his name and identification, explaining that he was being arrested for passing counterfeit currency, and asked if he was \\"on anything\\". According to the report officers Kueng and Lane attempted to help Floyd to their squad car, but at 8:14 p.m., Floyd stiffened up and fell to the ground. Soon, MPD Officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao arrived in a separate squad car. The officers made several more failed attempts to get Floyd into the squad car. Floyd, who was still handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer Kueng held Floyd's back and Lane held his legs. Chauvin placed his left knee in the area of Floyd's head and neck. A Facebook Live livestream recorded by a bystander showed Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. Floyd repeatedly tells Chauvin \\"Please\\" and \\"I can't breathe\\", while a bystander is heard telling the police officer, \\"You got him down. Let him breathe.\\" After some time, a bystander points out that Floyd was bleeding from his nose while another bystander tells the police that Floyd is \\"not even resisting arrest right now\\", to which the police tell the bystanders that Floyd was \\"talking, he's fine\\". A bystander replies saying Floyd \\"ain't fine\\". A bystander then protests that the police were preventing Floyd from breathing, urging them to \\"get him off the ground ... You could have put him in the car by now. He's not resisting arrest or nothing.\\" Floyd then goes silent and motionless. Chauvin does not remove his knee until an ambulance arrives. Emergency medical services put Floyd on a stretcher. Not only had Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for about seven minutes (including four minutes after Floyd stopped moving) but another video showed an additional two officers had also knelt on Floyd while another officer watched. Although the police report stated that medical services were requested prior to the time Floyd was placed in handcuffs, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Emergency Medical Services arrived at the scene six minutes after getting the call. Medics were unable to detect a pulse, and Floyd was pronounced dead at the hospital. An autopsy of Floyd was conducted on May 26, and the next day, the preliminary report by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office was published, which found \\"no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\\". Floyd's underlying health conditions included coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The initial report said that \\"[t]he combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\\" The medical examiner further said that Floyd was \\"high on fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamine at the time of his death\\". On June 1, a private autopsy which was commissioned by the family of Floyd ruled that Floyd's death was a homicide and it also found that Floyd had died due to asphyxiation which resulted from sustained pressure, which conflicted with the original autopsy report which was completed earlier that week. Shortly after, the official post-mortem declared Floyd's death a homicide. Video footage of Officer Derek Chauvin applying 8 minutes 15 seconds of sustained pressure to Floyd's neck generated global attention and raised questions about the use of force by law enforcement. On May 26, Chauvin and the other three officers were fired. He was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter; the former charge was later changed to second-degree murder.  Major protests and riots = Ahmaud Arbery protests, May 8  On February 23, Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia. Protests ensued in early May after a video surfaced that captured the shooting.  NFAC protests, May 12  Armed members of NFAC have demonstrated in separate protests across the US with the first appearance on May 12. On July 4, 100 to 200 NFAC members marched through Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta, Georgia, calling for the removal of the Confederate monument. On July 25, \\"more than 300\\" members were gathered in Louisville, Kentucky to protest the lack of action against the officers responsible for the March shooting of Breonna Taylor.Kenning, Chris, et. al. \\"Opposing armed militias converge in Louisville, escalating tensions but avoiding violence.\\" Courier Journal. July 25, 2020. Retrieved August 29, 2020. On October 3, over 400 members of the NFAC along with over 200 other armed protesters marched in downtown Lafayette, Louisiana.  Breonna Taylor protests, May 26; jury verdict protests, September 23  On March 13, Breonna Taylor was shot and killed. Demonstrations over her death began in May 26 2020, and lasted into August. One person was shot and killed during the protests. Protest erupted again on September 23, the night after the grand jury verdict was announced, protesters gathered in the Jefferson Square Park area of Louisville, as well as many other cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, Chicago, Seattle. In Louisville, two LMPD officers were shot during the protest and one suspect was kept in custody.  George Floyd protests, May 26  The major catalyst of the unrest was the killing of George Floyd on May 25. Though it was not the first controversial killing of a black person in 2020, it sparked a much wider series of global protests and riots which continued into August 2020. As of June 8, there were at least 19 deaths related to the protests. The George Floyd Protests are generally regarded as marking the start of the 2020 United States unrest. In Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul alone, the immediate aftermath of the killing of George Floyd was second-most destructive period of local unrest in United States history, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.Braxton, Grey (June 16, 2020). \\"They documented the ‚Äô92 L.A. uprising.

Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, June 8  Established on June 8 in Seattle, CHAZ/CHOP was a self-declared autonomous zone established in defiance of the killing of George Floyd after police abandoned the East Precinct building. Groups like the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club provided security while the protesters themselves provided either resources or assisted the PSJBGC in security. Multiple people were killed in altercations with security and on July 1 the autonomous zone/occupied protest was officially cleared by the Seattle Police Department.  Rayshard Brooks protests, June 12  Further unrest occurred as a result of the killing of Rayshard Brooks on June 12, largely in Atlanta, where he was killed. An 8-year-old girl was shot and killed during the protests.  Colorado Springs Protest, August 4  In Colorado Springs, a mixture of armed and unarmed left-wing protesters gathered to mark the one year anniversary of the shooting of De'Von Bailey, protesting in the neighborhood of the officer who shot and killed him. After threats of an armed counterprotest, protesters showed up armed. The protest was largely peaceful, except for multiple cases of heated shouting matches between protesters and residents. Later, on September 11, three people who attended the protest were arrested for various charges in a series of raids.  Stone Mountain Incident, August 15  In Stone Mountain, armed Neo-Confederate demonstrators affiliated with the Three Percenters arrived to allegedly protect the Confederate monument, with their operation dubbed ‚ÄúDefend Stone Mountain‚Äù. They were met and vastly outnumbered by the left-wing counterprotesters (who were armed as well), who began pushing them out of the town before the DeKalb County Police Department dispersed both parties. * Several minor injuries were reported.  Portland \\"Back the Blue\\" Rally, August 22  The Downtown Portland \\"Back the Blue\\" Rally, organized by members of the Proud Boys and QAnon Movement, sparked violence between right-wing protesters and left-wing counter-protesters. Within an hour of meeting each other, both sides began pushing, punching, paint-balling, and macing each other. There was one incident in which a right-wing protester (who was apart of the Proud Boys) pulled a gun at left-wing protesters, but no shots were fired. * *  Kenosha unrest, August 23 and 2020 American athlete strikes  The shooting of Jacob Blake on August 23 sparked the protests in a number of American cities, mostly within Kenosha. Two protesters were shot and killed in an incident during the protests. Nationally, athletes from the NHL, NBA, WNBA, MLB, and MLS began going on strike in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake. On October 14, prosecutors announced that Kyle Rittenhouse, who was charged with killing the two protesters, would not face gun charges in Illinois. Riot police in downtown Minneapolis, where large amounts of rioting and looting took place.  Minneapolis downtown riot, August 26  The Minneapolis downtown riot was a reaction to false rumors about the suicide of Eddie Sole Jr., a 38-year-old African American man. Demonstrators believed he had been shot by police officers. Surveillance video showed that Sole Jr. shot himself in the head during a manhunt for a homicide suspect in which he was the person of interest. Controversially, the police released the CCTV camera footage of the suicide in attempts to stop the unrest. Overnight vandalism and looting of stores from August 26 to 27 reached a total of 76 property locations in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul, including four business that were set on fire. State and local officials arrested a total of 132 people during the unrest and charged 27 people for crimes such as assault and burglary related to the rioting and looting. Two police officers were injured during the unrest, including one who was knocked unconscious by a demonstrator.  Dijon Kizzee protests, August 31  Dijon Kizzee, an armed cyclist, was shot and killed in the unincorporated Los Angeles neighborhood of Westmont on Aug 31 by deputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. For days, protesters gathered outside the heavily guarded South Los Angeles sheriff‚Äôs station in tense but peaceful demonstrations. By September 6, those demonstrations escalated to clashes, with deputies firing projectiles and tear gas at the crowds and arresting 35 people over four nights of unrest.  Daniel Prude protests, September 2  On March 22, Daniel Prude was killed by Rochester, New York police officers in what was found by the county medical examiner to be a homicide caused through \\"complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint\\". On September 2, the release of a police body camera video and written reports surrounding his death provoked protests in Rochester.  Deon Kay protests, September 2  On September 2, Deon Kay, an 18-year old man, was shot and killed by a police officer in Washington, D.C. Later that day, protesters started gathering outside of the Seventh District Metropolitan Police Department building.  Ricardo Munoz protests, September 13  On September 13, Protests erupted in Lancaster, Pennsylvania after a police officer shot and killed Ricardo Munoz who allegedly ran at them with a knife. Police later deployed tear gas on a crowd of protesters, saying demonstrators had damaged buildings and government vehicles and thrown bottles.  Deja Stallings protests, October 1  On September 30, Police arrested 25-year-old Deja Stallings at gas station and convenience store in Kansas City, Missouri in relation to an alleged 15-20 individuals fighting on the business's property. Video footage showed an officer kneeling on the back of Stallings, who is nine months pregnant. In response to the video, demonstrators began protesting outside city hall demanding the resignation of Kansas City Police Department Chief Richard Smith and for the city to redirect 50% of the police department's budget to social services.  Jonathan Price protests, October 5  On October 5, 31-year old Jonathan Price was killed by a police officer in Wolfe City, Texas after allegedly trying to break off a fight. Protests broke out in major cities to which New York City and Los Angeles faced property damage after night of vandalism. Shaun David Lucas, a police officer who shot Price, was arrested and charged with murder.  Alvin Cole protests, October 7  On the afternoon of October 7, the district attorney in Milwaukee County decided to not press charges in relation to the fatal shooting of Alvin Cole, 17 in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin back in February. Protests subsequently occurred since October 7, leading to the arrest of 24 protesters on October 8 and 28 protesters on October 9.  Themes and demands  Members of the American Indian Movement tore down the statue of Christopher Columbus outside the Minnesota State Capitol in June 2020 during the George Floyd protests  \\"Defund the police\\"  Activists in the unrest have used the slogan \\"defund the police\\", calling for divestment in policing.  Monument removals  Protesters have called for the removal of statues commemorating historical figures who are perceived as racist by modern standards. Often those depicted in the statues were responsible for human rights violations. A number were either removed by authorities, or vandalized and toppled by protesters. In particular, the statues of Confederate war veterans and politicians, as well as of Christopher Columbus. However, statues of US Presidents, including the Emancipation Memorial featuring Abraham Lincoln, have also been vandalized and attacked by protesters.  Related racial unrest outside the United States  Writing for Foreign Affairs, history professor Brenda Gayle Plummer noted that \\"The particulars of Floyd's murder, taking place against the backdrop of the pandemic, may well have been the dam-break moment for the global protest movement. But they are only part of the story. International solidarity with the African American civil rights struggle comes not from some kind of projection or spontaneous sentiment; it was seeded by centuries of black activism abroad and foreign concern about human rights violations in the United States.\\"  Netherlands  Related racial unrest in the Netherlands included widespread participation in George Floyd protests. The unrest has led to a change in public opinion on Zwarte Piet, a blackface character used in Dutch Sinterklaas celebrations. Leaving the appearance of Zwarte Piet unaltered has traditionally been supported by the public but opposed by anti- racism campaigners, but a June 2020 survey saw a drop in support for leaving the character's appearance unaltered: 47 per cent of those surveyed supported the traditional appearance, compared to 71 per cent in a similar survey held in November 2019. Prime minister Mark Rutte stated in a parliamentary debate on June 5, 2020 that he had changed his opinion on the issue and now has more understanding for people who consider the character's appearance to be racist.  United Kingdom  The 2020 United States racial unrest has triggered major protests, political gestures and policy changes in the United Kingdom, both in solidarity with the United States and in comparable protest against systemic racism in the United Kingdom. The debate over statues has been a defining feature of the unrest in the United Kingdom, following the unauthorized removal of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol on June 11 during a George Floyd protest. Her Majesty's Government (HMG) opposes even the legal removal of statues, with culture secretary Oliver Dowden writing a three-page letter to MPs, peers and councillors defending them as part of Britain's heritage. Prime minister Boris Johnson and home secretary Priti Patel condemned protesters who defaced the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square in London and HMG ordered that the statues be boarded up and protected.  Social impact = Public opinion  In June 2020, the high- profile killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery precipitated a national reckoning on systemic racism in the United States across, impacting culture, government, and industry. This reckoning confronted systemic inequality and racial injustice in the societal treatment of Black Americans, who have experienced disproportionately negative outcomes in the form of racial inequality such as in education, health care, housing, imprisonment, voting rights and wages as the result of overt discrimination and unconscious bias relative to the general population. While Black Americans acutely understood these racial inequities as part of their daily lives, many white Americans were insulated. In the years prior, there had been protests and skirmishes over killings of Black Americans by law enforcement, the 2015 Charleston church shooting and the 2017 Charlottesville rally which briefly received headlines yet did not lead to systemic change or as wide a level of support. However, the videos of Floyd's death and police violence at protests were revelatory to white Americans, who had a grappling with conflict of responsibility and inadvertently contributing to racial injustice and would support the George Floyd protests in greater numbers than they had prior protests of killings of Black American by law enforcement. By mid-June, after weeks of protests during the global COVID-19 pandemic and recession, American national culture and attitude towards racial injustice began to shift, including the Senate Armed Services Committee's approval of process to rename military facilities named for Confederate generals. American public opinion of racism and discrimination quickly shifted in the wake of these protests. Polling of white Americans showed an increased belief in having received advantages due to their race and increased belief that Black Americans received disproportionate force in policing. Public opinion in support of the Black Lives Matter movement greatly accelerated, with a surge of \\"am I racist\\" searches and a greater approval for removing Confederate statues and memorials. This increased response for racial justice might have been aided by antipathy towards President Donald Trump's support for police, greater understanding of disparate pandemic effects by race and a weakened sense of security following the COVID-19 pandemic's social distancing and an economic fallout with the COVID-19 recession. Others had grown accustomed to protest under Trump or were responding to his racial views, agitation and \\"demagoguery\\" or handling of the pandemic. Some white Americans reported feeling more social permission from other white people to support Black Lives Matter whereas it would have felt conspicuous prior.  Public debate  A week into the George Floyd protests, demonstrators targeted Confederate monuments and memorials for removal, due to their association with institutional racism and white supremacy. By late June, activists extended their campaign to statues of American presidents and other iconic figures who were slaveowners or participants in racial discrimination, including some who were never slaveowners. A proposed removal of an Abraham Lincoln statue was rejected by the University of Wisconsin-Madison while an unsolved theft of Maplewood Park's Frederick Douglass statue was widely seen as a backlash to the reckoning. Other targeted statues depicted Black people in deferential poses. Activists continued to organize to dismantle statues and some politicians preemptively moved to remove statues in advance of activist direct action. Faced with civil unrest, politicians became highly motivated to fulfill dormant promises to remove Confederate symbols. Activist momentum spread to other Confederate symbols, especially the modern display of the Confederate battle flag. Following press in which NASCAR banned its display and organizations including Walmart and the NCAA announced that they would no longer fly the Mississippi flag, the last state flag to include the symbol, the state quickly voted to retire the flag. The removal of symbols sparked national debate and reflection over what reverence was appropriate to bestow on historical figures whose national influence coincided with participation in institutions of racism. Beyond monuments and Confederate symbols, public backlash widened to other institutional symbols, including place names, namesakes, brands and resignations. Rhode Island removed \\"Providence Plantations\\" from the state's formal name. Colleges renamed buildings and governments renamed public works. Princeton University renamed its Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Household products including Aunt Jemima syrup, Uncle Ben's rice and Cream of Wheat pledged to review racial stereotypes in their marketing. Music groups including the Dixie Chicks and Lady Antebellum changed their names to remove references to the Southern United States. The Washington Redskins of the National Football League, whose controversial team name had become a symbol of racial discrimination, pledged to change its name following pressure from business sponsors and a 12-year advocacy campaign. Some firms in the music industry phased out the term \\"urban music\\" as outdated and a social media debate considered whether the United States should change its national anthem based on a verse that some historians interpret as supporting violence against slaves. Companies that had donated to Black Lives Matter causes without addressing internal diversity issues were publicly lambasted on social media. Leaders in the media and entertainment industries were ousted over their handling of racial issues, as were other celebrities and actors. Reckonings over racial inclusiveness and equability expanded to the wine industry. Debates continued across corporate leadership, media organizations and other cultural institutions. Researchers went on strike to demand protections for Black lives. Public conversations on race and power extended to other cultural practices. One debate addressed racial vocabulary. Hundreds of news organizations modified their style guides to capitalize \\"Black\\" as a proper noun in recognition of the term's shared political identity and experiences. Merriam-Webster modified its definition of racism. Americans reconsidered and replaced words and phrases with similarities to discriminatory terms such as \\"master bedroom\\" and \\"whitelist\\"/\\"blacklist\\". This encompassed \\"master/slave\\" distinctions in technology and also situations which refer to the master as the opposite of a copy. Real estate and technology organizations announced they would use more inclusive alternatives. Journalists at major American newspapers contested their own coverage of the events. In the music industry, the BMG Rights Management announced it would reevaluate its record deals for race-based compensation disparities. Major record labels began searches for diversity officers and the Black Music Action Coalition formed to address industry racial inequities. The major sports channel ESPN began to air political commentary, reversing a longstanding mandate to separate sports from politics. College athletes led boycotts and a wildcat strike during the NBA playoff led to a work stoppage from other American professional athletes following the August shooting of Jacob Blake.  Consumer behavior  Anti- racist self-education became a trend throughout June 2020 in the United States and Black anti-racist writers found new audiences. During the Floyd protests, Black-owned bookstores saw an influx of interest, especially for books on social justice topics. In the span of two weeks from early to late June, books about race went from composing none to two-thirds of the New York Times Best Seller list. Amazon sales saw a similar pattern. In comparison, no such surge happened after prior prominent Black Lives Matter demonstrations. Popular Black authors included Ibram X. Kendi (How to Be an Antiracist, Stamped from the Beginning), Ijeoma Oluo (So You Want to Talk About Race) and Layla Saad (Me and White Supremacy). Bestsellers also include Black biographies and memoirs (Becoming, Born a Crime, Between the World and Me, Just Mercy), anti- racist books by white authors (White Fragility, The Color of Law) and older books (The New Jim Crow, The Fire Next Time). Online library checkouts of anti-racist literature increased tenfold by mid-June. Some municipal libraries saw waitlists in the thousands per title. Amazon's tracking of daily e-book readers and audiobook listeners reflected the increased readership, when many of the aforementioned books entered its most-read list. Spurred by messages on social media, American consumers sought out Black-owned businesses to support. June saw record high Google searches for \\"Black-owned businesses near me\\" and smartphone restaurant discovery apps added features for discovering Black- owned restaurants. Businesses on social media lists saw significantly increased sales. Black-owned bookstores in particular had difficulty meeting demand. There was also a social media and Facebook boycott on self-education. Many major American corporations pursued anti-racism and diversity training workshops, particularly companies seeking to be consistent with their Black Lives Matter messaging. Demand for these trainings had grown over time, especially since 2016, interest in diversity training bookings spiked during this period of reckoning. Robin DiAngelo, whose White Fragility topped the Amazon bestsellers list, rose to prominence during this time and was a popular speaker.  Analysis  The recent scrutiny on race relations in the United States brought comparisons to the Weinstein effect in which the Me Too movement revealed unspoken inequities and put pressure on public figures for legacies of sexual assault and harassment. Similarly, the American public under its racial injustice reckoning pressured American industries to confront alleged legacies of racism. The resulting symbolic divestments targeted white cultural hegemony. NPR wrote that renamed landmarks and similar gestures would not provide economic opportunities or civil rights but signaled cultural disapproval towards symbols associated with racial injustice, including the history of racism and slavery. The New Yorker likened the dispersed national response to an \\"American Spring\\" on par with the Arab Spring and other international revolutionary waves. Effects of American activism were felt internationally, with global protests destroying their own local symbols of racial injustice, with The New Yorker also having a part on international solidarity towards police violence, in keeping with the precedent of felling statues in postcolonial Africa and post-Soviet states as well as in Australia and France. Pop culture website The Ringer said the phenomenon was \\"having a transformative impact on race relations in America\\" and included a reckoning with both history and contemporary culture. Harold Dorrell Briscoe, a pastor and theologian, says that American Christian churches are poorly prepared to deal with the societal shift, but that it is both a religious Christian duty to provide moral leadership on the issue and an opportunity for the traditional spiritual elements of American society to regain currency by meeting the challenge presented.  Firearms  The unrest precipitated an unprecedented number of firearm sales in the U.S. Background checks for legally purchased firearms reached record highs starting in May, with year-on- year numbers up 80.2% and running through the rest of the summer. This represented the highest monthly number of firearms transfers since the FBI began keeping records in 1998. Firearms retailers surveyed by National Shooting Sports Foundation in May estimated that 40% of their sales came from first-time gun buyers, 40% of those first-time gun buyers were women. Gun sales have been up across the country, a rise in first-time gun buyers in left-leaning states like California have helped fuel the national uptick in firearms and ammunition purchases. June 2020 represented the largest month of firearms purchases in United States history, with Illinois purchasing more firearms than any other state. The last days of May and first week of June, there were more than 90 attempted or successful burglaries of gun stores, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF). More than 1,000 guns were stolen in that window of time. On May 31 alone, the BATF reported 29 separate burglaries targeting licensed firearm retailers.

Harris later abandoned Pacifism during World War II.  Biography  In an era where anti-German and anti-Jewish sentiments often went together, many British Jews feared that opposition to World War I would lead to accusations of disloyalty. The Princes Road congregation, in particular, were keen to seem as British as possible: Harris' Hazzan position was known as \\"Reader\\", and could only be held by a British-born son of a British father. His attempts to provide Jewish conscientious objectors with the same support at their Military Service Tribunals as ministers of other religions, together with his sermons and writings in the press, brought him into conflict with his superior Samuel Friedeberg, who strongly supported the war and refused to testify at tribunals. After losing the support of his congregation in 1916, Harris moved to London where became Minister of Hammersmith Synagogue and wrote a book justifying pacifism on the basis of Jewish Law. He was not charged under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 although his son Hugh Harris, also a pacifist and conscientious objector, was jailed for refusing conscription. Harris abandoned Pacifism during World War II, writing that \\"the cry of the tortured and persecuted victims of the Nazis has been too bitter to deny them what appears to be the only solution of their sufferings and the only alternative to their extermination.\\"  References  Category:Jewish pacifists Category:1866 births Category:English Jews Category:1945 deaths Category:Hazzans ","title":"John Solomon Harris"},{"id":"65091922","text":"Vatnaj√∂kull: In the western part to be seen are the Gr√≠msv√∂tn caldera (dark half-moon indentation), to the north of it Gj√°lp, and to the north of Gj√°lp the completely subglacial caldera of B√°r√∞arbunga Icelandic rift zones and Vatnaj√∂kull: East Volcanic Zone (no. 4) crossing its western part Gj√°lp is a hyaloclastite ridge (tindar) in Iceland under the Vatnaj√∂kull glacier shield.

The glacier is temperate, lies in lower elevations and is therefore sensible to climatic changes. As a consequence it has been advancing and retreating since the Weichselian glaciation. Its last advance took place during the so called Little Ice Age from the 13th to the end of the 19th century and since then it is retreating.

Measurements showed an accentuated and even accelerating rate of glacio-isostatic uplift. This could lead to increased magma production (so called decompression melt production), because the \\"pot lid\\" formed by the glaciers and their weight will be absent in the future, and eruption frequency could increase as a consequence.See eg.: P.

Geology This kind of eruption, but under a glacier shield Ice cauldrons merging to form an ice canyon at the glacier covered Colombian volcano Nevado del Tolima Similar built hyaloclastite ridges (tindars) of the B√°r√∞arbunga-Vei√∞iv√∂tn volcanic system not far from Landmannalaugar The Gj√°lp eruption formed in about two weeks a subglacial hyaloclastite ridge, also called tindar by some geologists, in a zone of known former eruptions. The eruption in 1996Precursors and possible connection between volcanic systems= Some heavy earthquakes (M5+) had taken place in the central volcano B√°r√∞arbunga before and proved to be precursors of the eruptive events. New seismological studies (2019) see a parallel to the 2014-2015 eruptions and to the caldera drop in B√°r√∞arbunga central volcano and postulate a similar magma migration to the eruption site though on a smaller scale. This could mean that the volcano is part of the fissure system of B√°r√∞arbunga, not Gr√≠msv√∂tn.K. I. KONSTANTINOU, etal.: Reappraisal of Seismicity Recorded During the 1996 Gj√°lp Eruption, Iceland, in Light of the 2014‚Äì2015 B√°r√∞arbunga‚ÄìHoluhraun Lateral Dike Intrusion. Pure Appl. Geophys. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00024-019-02387-x Another possibility is that B√°r√∞arbunga magma entered in a smaller portion the magmatic system of Gr√≠msv√∂tn and started the eruption by this intrusion. B√°r√∞arbunga is known for such tendencies, her magma mingled with Torfaj√∂kull magma at least three times in the past which resulted in bimodal eruptions, eg. of the Vei√∞iv√∂tn and at Landmannalaugar by the end of the 15th century.See eg.: G.F. Zellmer, etal.: On the recent bimodal magmatic processes and their rates in theTorfaj√∂kull‚ÄìVeidiv√∂tn area, Iceland. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 269 (2008) 387‚Äì397. =Formation of the tindar volcano= The Gj√°lp eruption took place at a some kilometers long known fissure under 550-700 m of glacier ice within Vatnaj√∂kull. The eruption in October 1996 could push through this ice in about 30 hours and took place from 30 september to 13 October 1996. The eruption fissure had a length of 6-7 km. The location is some kilometers to the north of Gr√≠msv√∂tn caldera. In the beginning, a 2-4 km long N-S trending depression was formed above the fissure, with time three ice cauldrons were built at each end and in the middle, but the eruption concentrated later on one of them where a 200-300 m wide crater came to light. After some time, an open ice canyon was built above the fissure. It had a length of about 3,5 km and was up to 500 m in width. The meltwater drained first through the ice canyon and then disappeared into subglacial channels and run from there to the subglacial caldera lake of Gr√≠msv√∂tn. The subglacial channels were easily recognized, because continuous melting caused by the hot water from the eruption site initiated the formation of depressions on the ice surface. And so the scientists followed the melting path down to Gr√≠msv√∂tn caldera. Though the eruption was mostly explosive, the ash was not expelled far from the vents, but fell back into the canyon. The quantity of eruption products stayed more or less the same the whole time which was explained by ice flow into the crater. During the two weeks of eruption, volcanic activity thawed no less than 3 km3 of ice, and this continued to a lesser extent for some time after the end of the eruption. The newly formed tindar disappeared again completely under the glacier ice about 1 year later. =Eruption products= The eruptive products consisted of basaltic andesite which surprised the scientists as these more evolved rocks are neither typical for B√°r√∞arbunga nor for Gr√≠msv√∂tn, both more connected to basaltic volcanism. Some scientists thought that Gj√°lp could be an independent volcano.

But it took some time to fill the subglacial lake of Gr√≠msv√∂tn in such a manner that the ice wall holding it back would break. Not before some weeks had passed after the eruption was terminated, the expected j√∂kulhlaup took place from 4 November to 7 November 1996. The meltwater streamed mostly in subglacial channels and in the end under the outlet glacier Skei√∞ar√°rj√∂kull. There, to everybody‚Äôs surprise, the water masses streamed in such a quantity that the whole glacier was lifted up.Tomas J√≥hannesson: Propagation of a subglacial flood wave during the initiation of a j√¥kulhlaup.

Luckily, the road had been closed before so that nobody was injured. The volume of meltwater produced by this eruption was around 4 km3.M.T. Gudmundsson, G. Larsen, √Å. H√∂skuldsson and √Å.G.

It made provision for searching and boring for and getting (producing) petroleum and natural gas, under appropriate licenses.  Background  Before 1934 there was a lack of clarity about the ownership of oil beneath a property. For example, in 1919 the Attorney-General was asked in Parliament whether the surface owner also owned the oil beneath their land.Hansard, House of Commons debate, 12 August 1919, vol. 119 c. 1128 The Attorney-General acknowledged that opinions differed, but was inclined to the view that the surface owner is the owner of oil beneath the land. The 1934 Act clarified the position and vested underground oil in the Crown. The Petroleum (Production) Act 1918 had required persons wishing to prospect for oil to obtain a license from the Board of Trade. However between 1918 and 1934 only seven licenses were issued and by 1934 only three were in force. Furthermore, oil prices were generally falling during the 1920s thereby discouraging exploration.

He was originally a subordinate of Hu Kang who rebelled in Jingzhou but later took command after killing the latter for his growing paranoia. His rebellion coincided with the rebellions of Wang Ru, Du Tao and Wang Ji in Jingzhou and Xiangzhou shortly after the Disaster of Yongjia in 311, but his would be the longest of the four, only ending in 319 with his death at the hands of Zhou Fang.  As subordinate of Sima Xin and Hu Kang  Du Zeng was from Xinye County in Nanyang Commandary and started his career under the Prince of Xinye, Sima Xin (Âè∏È¶¨Ê≠Ü). Du Zeng was said to be a very strong man, being able to swim across a river while wearing armor. Under Sima Xin, he rose to the rank of Colonel of the Southern Man Tribes and was present wherever Sima Xin went until his death in 303 when he was killed by the rebel Zhang Chang. He would reappear in 312 to join Hu Kang (ËÉ°‰∫¢) in his rebellion against Jin in Jingzhou after Luoyang fell to Han Zhao troops a year prior. Hu Kang was also another one Sima Xin's officers before his death and served as General of the Serrated Gate. When the Disaster of Yongjia broke out, he took the opportunity to gather men at Jingling and start a rebellion, declaring himself Duke of Chu.

Du Zeng plotted to get rid of him but first he acted loyally to gain his trust. Later that year, Hu Kang wanted to campaign against the bandit Wang Chong (ÁéãÊ≤ñ) and Du Zeng encouraged him to. Then, Du Zeng had artisans to tamper with Hu Kang's personal guards' weapons before enticing Wang Chong to attack Hu. Hu sent out all his men against Wang Chong, leaving him defenseless against Du Zeng.

Voters will elect the President, and members of the National Assembly and Senate. Background The Constitution of Kenya requires a general election of members of parliament to be held on the second Tuesday in August in every fifth year, which means the next general election is scheduled for 9 August 2022. If Kenya is at war, the election can be delayed if a resolution is passed in each House of Parliament by at least two-thirds of all the members of the House. Such a resolution can delay the election by up to six months, and may be passed multiple times provided that the delays do not cumulatively exceed 12 months. The Constitution requires that a presidential election take place at the same time as the general election. In the unlikely event that prior to the next general election the position of president falls vacant, and the office of deputy president is also vacant (who otherwise would assume the office of president), a presidential election could be held at an earlier date. According to the Constitution in such circumstances, an election needs to be held within sixty days after the vacancy arose in the office of President. Incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta is ineligible to pursue a third term due to the two-term limit in the Constitution of Kenya. Electoral system The President of Kenya is elected using a modified version of the two-round system: to win in the first round, a candidate must receive over 50% of the vote and at least 25% of the vote in a minimum of 24 of the 47 counties.Presidential Candidates Kenya Diaspora VoteArticle 138 (4) Constitution of Kenya 2010 The 337 members of the National Assembly are elected by two methods; 290 are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting.

History During his stay in the United States, the violinist Ole Bull purchased a large piece of land in Potter County, Pennsylvania, in 1852. He gave it the name Oleana or New Norway. Bull's intention was to invite Scandinavian immigrants to build and settle there. It soon became apparent that the land was not suitable for settlement at all. In the first year, up to 700 immigrants settled and tried to establish new homes there, roads were created, and a sawmill and other facilities were built. However, already after one year, the settlers realized that it was not possible to make a living because of the poor soil, and so they moved on, many to Wisconsin. When Bull arrived in New York in 1852, he was deeply disappointed that the Storting had rejected his application for support for a theater he himself had started in Bergen; namely, the National Theater. Instead, he now devoted himself to the New Norway project high up in the Allegheny Mountains, which Henrik Wergeland had written a beautiful poem about. He purchased the area there with the New York attorney John Hopper (the son of Isaac Hopper) and a third party. He received 11,144 acres for a total of $10,388, and he became chairman of an operating company with John F. Cowan as manager. Bull's contribution to the operating company was $25,000 because everything from roads and homes to a church and a school, a mill, and canals were needed here. In the neighboring county there was a foundry, and the company hoped for a profitable government contract for casting 10,000 cannons. They also hoped for railways and to find ore. The first settlers arrived in September 1852. They received $15 a month, as well as board and lodging. They were allowed to buy land at an introductory price of $3 per acre, rising to $10 after a few years. Bull also selected a plot for his own house. \\"We are here to found a new Norway, dedicated to freedom and independence, and protected by the glorious flag of America,\\" he declared at the inauguration on September 8, 1852. However, to own land in Pennsylvania one had to be a US citizen, or declare that one wanted to become so. Bull resolved this issue by making such a statement at a separate ceremony in Philadelphia. This displeased many Norwegians. Bull had an agent in New York and one in Norway to recruit new colonists, but his income failed because he also had an agent as well as a singer at his concerts. Previously, he could earn up to $3,000 at one concert, albeit gross. However, now he was lucky if he was left with $500 in profit. In the colony there were twelve deaths the first winter and meager times, while Bull dreamed about buying an abandoned iron works and planned a polytechnic school with professors from Europe, as well as its own sanatorium. In March 1853, money for the settlers' wages stopped coming in. On the other hand, the deed was in order, but then it turned out that the agreement contained three parcels that were not included in the purchase. These exceptions amounted to more than 650 acres; namely, the valley bottoms in the area, where agriculture could be practiced in the otherwise very hilly terrain. Oleana itself and the plot where Bull's own house stood were not included in the purchase either, but belonged to Cowan. It was not until May 17 that Bull showed up and personally distributed $7,000 in outstanding salaries and other receivables. He agreed to return on Independence Day, July 4, but instead went to New York, ill and bankrupt. The project was completed on his part, and he preferred to inform his attorney Lucius E. Bulkley about this instead of the settlers. When he found out in the fall how bad things were with them, he gave several concerts to raise income for them. Several settlers had almost sued him at the time because of money he owed them. The sheriff in a small town seized Bull's violin due to an unpaid hotel bill of $403, but he was strongly criticized for this by The New York Times. Most settlers went their separate ways; that winter there were fewer than fifty remaining, and later they also left. Bull, on the other hand, is believed to have lost around $70,000 on the project, in addition to the fact that people had lost much of their respect for him. The loss probably could have been avoided if he had sold the timber in the area, but his lawyer Lucius E. Bulkley, who advised him, did not know how valuable this was. Bull was nevertheless not intimidated by the financial loss, and he started an opera in New York two years later‚Äîwhich he lost $12,800 on. Legacy There was a lot of talk in Norway about the fantastic opportunities the emigrants were promised in Oleana. However, when it gradually became known that there was no arable land, Ditmar Meidell wrote the satirical song \\"Oleana\\" about the attempt to create a model Nordic society in America. This song has been covered from time to time, including in the TV personality and songwriter Erik Bye's repertoire. The song was also translated into English as \\"Oleanna\\" and was popularized by former Weavers member Pete Seeger. Today, large parts of the area are included in Ole Bull State Park.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. The following incidents occurred during 1976: * 1976 On January 7, a repair crew working on natural gas gathering compressor station at Cedardale, Oklahoma, opened the wrong valve in an attempt to increase gas flow. Natural gas & Natural Gas Liquids flow out of an open 12-inch pipeline, and were ignited by an open flame heater. 5 of the crew were killed, and 2 seriously burned. * 1976 On January 10, a gas leak, at the Pathfinder Hotel, in Fremont, Nebraska, exploded, killing 20 people, and, injuring 39 others. A 6 foot by 6 foot section of sidewalk was hurled through the roof of a nearby bakery. A compression coupling, on a Aldyl-A plastic gas line, had pulled apart, causing gas to leak into the Hotel's basement.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR7606.pdf * 1976 A MAPCO LPG/NGL pipeline ruptured near Whitharral, Texas, leading to vapor cloud fire that killed one, severely burning 4 others who later died, destroyed two homes, and burned an area about 400 yards wide. A Low Frequency Electric Resistance Weld (LF-ERW) seam failure is suspected for the failure. From January 1968 to the date of the Whitharral accident, 14 longitudinal pipe seam failures had occurred on that pipeline system, which resulted in 6 other fatalities, and the loss of over of LPG.(February 25, 1976) * 1976 An improperly assembled compression coupling failed on a gas distribution line in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8, causing a house explosion that killed 2 people. * 1976 On March 2, an 18-inch Gulf Oil pipeline failure spilled about 21,000 gallons of crude oil into the Wisner Wildlife Area in Louisiana. There were no initial reports of wildlife being affected. * 1976 On March 16, a 6-inch ARCO pipeline failed near Tilden Township, Pennsylvania, spilling gasoline into a stream. * 1976 On March 27, a two-story building in Phenix City, Alabama, exploded and burned from a gas leak. The explosion and fire killed the six persons in the building. The NTSB found that gas at 20-psig pressure had leaked from a cracked, 3-inch cast iron gas main. * 1976 A front loader hit a Standard Oil of California (now Chevron Corporation) 8-inch petroleum products pipeline in Los Angeles, California, during a road widening project along Venice Boulevard. 9 people were killed, a plastic factory was destroyed, and other serious property damage occurred. (June 16, 1976) *1976 On August 8, a house exploded from gas migrating through the soil, from a broken 4 inch gas main, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. 26 minutes later, gas then exploded in another house, causing a brick wall & part of the street to collapse. 2 firefighters were killed, 14 people injured, and 4 buildings destroyed. * 1976 A road grader hit a 20-inch gas transmission pipeline, near Calhoun, Louisiana. Six people were killed in the ensuing fire, 6 families were left homeless, and a mobile home, and 2 houses, were destroyed. (August 9, 1976) * 1976 On August 13, a flash fire in the basement of a house in Bangor, Maine, occurred while a gas company crew was checking for the cause of low gas pressure at the home. The fire killed one gas company employee, burned two other employees, and caused minor damage to the house. One of the crew was using a match to light the basement of the home, and another crew member was smoking when the fire started. * 1976 On August 29, an explosion and fire destroyed a house at Kenosha, Wisconsin. Two persons were killed, four persons were injured, and two adjacent houses were damaged. The destroyed house was not served by natural gas. However, natural gas, which was escaping at 58 psig pressure from a punctured 2-inch plastic main located away, had entered the house through a 6-inch sewer lateral that had been bored through to install the gas line.http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/recletters/1976/P76_22_25.pdf * 1976 On September 10, sewer work and heavy equipment caused soil subsidence on a 6-inch cast iron gas pipe in Blue Island, Illinois, resulting in the pipe breaking in 4 places. Gas then migrated into a building, that later exploded, killing 1 person, and, injuring 10 others. * 1976 On November 28, an 8-inch Sunoco pipeline began leaking in Toledo, Ohio, spilling about 1,000 barrels of gasoline, forcing a major road closure. There were no injuries. * 1976 An explosion and fire at a gas pipeline compressor station in Orange Grove, Texas killed one plant worker, and injured another on December 6.

Known for his performances as a character actor, he was called the 'bad man of the Indian screen' for his portrayal of roles with negative shades. He made his debut with the silent film Safdar Jung (1930). Hiralal also took part in India's independence movement and became an activist with the Indian National Congress when he was 14. He was later associated with the group of political and social workers that included Lala Lajpat Rai and Bhagat Singh, before moving into a career in films in 1928. After a distinguished career in films for over fifty years which included at least 150 films, he died penniless in 1981.  Career  Hiralal took to acting in films \\"as a hobby\\" after being asked by filmmaker Abdur Rashid Kardar, who was making Safdar Jung in Lahore, to play the role of a Pathan. Filming of Safdar Jung had begun in 1924 and Hiralal joined in 1929. He then appeared in another silent film, Daughters of Today, which saw theatrical release first. Hiralal recalled having a \\"thirst for authenticity\\" early on in his career, citing an example of him going bald to play a \\"one-eyed bald-headed man\\" in his next film, the 1931 film Awara Raqasa (\\"Wandering Dancer\\"), also directed by Kardar. He switched to sound films, later making his debut with Pavitra Ganga (1932) in which he played a \\"mad monk\\" as one character. He appeared in dual roles in the film, both as the protagonist and antagonist, opposite Nalini Tarkhad. His performance in Din-o-Duniya (1936) as General Mohammad Tariq received praise. Hiralal then moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and became associated with the New Theatres film studio. It was here under the \\"able guidance\\" of filmmaker Hemachandra Chunder that he felt he had become \\"a real actor\\". He appeared in Mera Punjab (1940), an adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, in which he played three stages of a man's life: \\"the young man, the father and the grandfather\\". He then appeared in Sipahi (1941), playing \\"a soldier who fights for his country (in World War I) and then under the economic depression that follows is unable to find a job. On the verge of starvation, he becomes a gangster and at the end is shot in an encounter with his pursuers.\\" He called the final sequence in the film in which the soldier-turned-gangster is cornered by six or seven men and is shot \\"the most moving scene\\" he had ever played. Hiralal recollected in an interview in the 1960s that it was with his role in Faisla (1947) opposite Kanan Devi that he was \\"able to form a certain concept of villainy which served me well later when I began to play the villain in most of my pictures.\\" In Chunder's Teen Bhai (1955), he \\"played a villain\\" opposite Pahari Sanyal, Nazir Hussain and Bharat Bhushan's characters. Hiralal's association with the New Theatres, however, ended in 1949, when he moved to Bombay (now Mumbai). In Bombay, his first film Badal (1951), in which he played a \\" villainous sardar whose greed for money is his undoing\\", was received well. In Kishore Sahu's Sapna (1952), he played an outlaw who kidnaps the heroine played by Bina Rai. In K. Amarnath's Mehbooba (1954), he played a dacoit. In G. P. Sippy's Chandrakanta (1956), he played \\"a mad conqueror who wanted his people to worship him as a living God.\\" Hiralal studied the lives of Nero and a few Egyptian Pharaohs in preparation for the role. He starred in Leader (1964) as a \\"fanatic killer who is out to exterminate a famous man.\\" Hiralal rated his performance in the 1948 film Jhoothi Kasmein his best, during an interview with the Indian Express in 1965. He added that Swayamsiddha (1947) and Anjangarh (1948) were films that gave him \\"inspiration and strength\\". Hiralal credited filmmakers Birendranath Sircar and Hemachandra Chunder for having taught him to become a character actor, Roop K. Shorey for the \\"laugh\\" and \\"weep without sobbing\\" in films. He recalled Amarnath \\"built him up as a fighter\\" with his film Sarkar (1951). Hiralal was a fan of American actors John Barrymore and Paul Muni.  Personal life  Hiralal was born into a Punjabi family on 14 March 1909 (or 1910) in Lahore, then a city in the Punjab Province of British India (in present-day Pakistan). He was the second of three children of Parvati Devi and Sunderlal Thakur, a businessman; the other two were older brother Pannalal and a younger sister who died at age three. Hiralal completed his education in Lahore and grew up watching and being influenced by the character of Ravana in the Ramlila plays. Hiralal married Darparani in 1945 and had five sons and a daughter with her. The sons were Krishna, Kamal, Prem, Ajay, and Inder, the latter of whom was an actor and model, and died in the Air India Flight 182 bombing in 1985. Apart from his mother tongue Punjabi, Hiralal could speak fluently in Hindi, Urdu and English.

In metalwork, reticulation refers to a decorative surface finishing technique involving the application of localised heat to the surface of a metal object. Reticulation is typically performed on alloys of silver and copper or of gold and copper. Reticulation exploits the difference between the melting temperature of an unalloyed metal and that of an alloy of the metal; by depleting the base metal content in the surface layer, a piece can be heated in such a manner so as to render the interior of the piece molten while leaving the surface of the piece intact. The reticulated surface is formed by the thermal expansion and contraction of the interior metal which is effected by deliberate variation in the application of localised heat. In the late 19th century, reticulation was used as a decorative technique by Russian goldsmiths such as Faberg√©, where the process was referred to as samorodok (lit. \\"born by itself\\"). Use of the technique spread to the Nordic and Scandinavian countries where it was applied in the creation of objects such as cigarette boxes, card cases, eyeglass cases, and flasks.

It was founded by its first m√ºderris, Veysel Efendi, who oversaw construction that finished in 1748. In 1912, during the Balkan Wars, the building was commandeered to stable troops from the army of the Kingdom of Montenegro. The madrasa was burned and completely destroyed save for an outer wall during the Kosovo War. Built in the Ottoman style, the complex includes in addition to the madrasa a dormitory, classroom, muezzin office, shadirvan, and mosque. All but the muezzin's first-floor office are on the ground floor. Each dormitory has its own veranda. The classroom serves as a library with its own distinctive structure, and there once was a dining hall as well. The muezzin facility is one of the highlights of the complex, featuring a three-console fa√ßade with long alcoves and extensive geometric detail: space is included for the muezzin and guests to stay. The mosque is high but lacks a minaret, though a stone slab wide in the southwest corner was supposed to have served as a staging post for the call to prayer.

Between documentary-like scenes and fictional acting, as well as archive material, the narrative of a love story is created, rolled up from its end. Happiness Is a Warm Gun premiered at the International Locarno Film Festival in August 2001.https://www.swissfilms.ch/de/film_search/filmdetails/-/id_film/-937604536 The film won the Zurich Film Prize 2001https://www.srf.ch/kultur/film- serien/film-tipp-des-tages-zu-zweit-2937604536 and was nominated for the Swiss Film Prize for best feature film and best leading actress.  Plot  Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" is about the murder of the green pacifist Petra Kelly, who is shot in her sleep by her life partner Gert Bastian, ex- Bundeswehr-General, before he kills himself. The film begins where the lives of the real characters end. Petra and Gert find themselves in the transit area of a modern airport and settle down in this artificial in-between world, trying to pick up the thread of the past - their political activity - while in their conversations what happened is fragmentary. Cast * Linda Olsansky: Petra * Herbert Fritsch: Gert  Background  \\"After leaving the Bundestag, Kelly lived with her partner Gert Bastian in seclusion in their house in the Tannenbusch district of Bonn. She was seriously ill and suffered from fear of threats (after having received threatening letters). She was on the police's list of endangered personalities, but refused personal protection. According to the police report, Kelly was killed in her sleep by Bastian with his Deringer-type pistol under circumstances that are not completely clear, and Bastian is said to have put an end to his life afterwards, whereby according to a report in Der Spiegel magazine, the gun was aimed from above at a spot just above the forehead. The bodies were found on October 19, 1992 - several weeks after the crime. The exact date could therefore no longer be determined with certainty; the time of death is assumed to be the night of October 1, 1992.\\"[http://whttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_Kelly#cite_note-1  Reception  \\"'The bullet', says Petra Kelly of this film, 'managed to push everything away in a very short time with a very warm sensation, it made room in me and that was probably the moment when I briefly took off. This is roughly how the images of Thomas Imbach's film want to behave, in their ruthlessness to push everything aside, including what we know about this historical and mythical couple. This film observes death from within at work. In the long moment of death, this ego is astonished. Not about death, but about not being able to live. Not about futility, but about the fact that all this exhausting effort has not brought the world and this ego one millimeter closer. At this point, and not only in the documentary and memory fragments, Happiness Is A Warm Gun is as radically political as it is radically physical.\\"Georg See√ülen. In: epd-Film 10/2002 \\"Imbach's film is certainly more clearly an interpretation, a variation on a true story, as he says himself in the opening credits. In return, an attitude becomes palpable. He is not afraid of the ugly sides of his character, but something else is more important. His film is also a declaration of love, the two protagonists, especially Petra, are beautiful. In the detail shots that are typical for him, which make the viewer perceive things that would otherwise be ignored, he admires Petra's lips, the little hollow on her neck. Her tenderness, when in one scene she wordlessly and carefully washes the exhausted Gert standing naked in front of her.\\"Mathias Heybrock. In: Tages-Anzeiger.12.11.2001 \\"Imbach has staged a version of the tragedy that shows the human-all-too-human extras behind the main actors on the political stage.\\"S√§chsische Zeitung \\"In 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun', the Swiss artist experiments with unreal leaps in time between past and future, between this world and the next, as we know it from the thrillers of David Lynch. A captivating, intense chamber play with unusual perspectives, which hopefully will find a distributor.\\"Die Welt \\"In a brilliant montage, Imbach extends the lives of Kelly and Bastian to the present day, virtually bombarding his audience with images and sounds... Cinema in the best sense of the word, which teaches you to see and hear.\\" SonntagsZeitung \\"Their unconditional and at the same time constantly reflected play creates a new, unique dimension of reality for the film - fragmentation and reconstruction reconciling, as it were. But it is also astonishing how Thomas Imbach, in this, his first actual directorial work with actors, understood how to bring his actors to \\"controlled identification\\", according to the theses he formulated: \\"Tell your actor who he is, but not what he should do\\", and \\"Every emotional movement of the actor is that of the character. There are no breaks in shooting\\" Bold words, indeed.\\"Christoph Egger: Feature film means playing with film NZZ of November 9, 2001  Weblinks  * * official website  References  Category:2002 films Category:Swiss films Category:German- language films Category:Swiss drama films ","title":"Happiness is a Warm Gun (film)"},{"id":"65092773","text":"Adinassa parrulai (MNHN-IM-2014-6961).jpeg is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Nassariidae, the Nassa mud snails or dog whelks.MolluscaBase eds.

He became a portraitist for the Roman nobility, and today is considered one of Cosentino's most prominent painters of the 18th century. The noblewoman Lucrezia Ruffo Della Valle took the young painter under her protection. She sent Pascaletti to Naples, where he studied under Francesco Solimena. Pascaletti moved to Rome in 1727, where he was to remain for the next twenty years. In Rome, Pascaletti joined the Academy of Virtuosi al Pantheon, and associated with Sebastiano Conca. In the early 18th century, Pascaletti painted three notable portraits for the nobility, namely, Giuliano Colonna of Stigliano, I principe of Sonnino, his consort, Princess Giovanna van den Eynde, and their grandson, Marcantonio Colonna, 3rd Prince of Sonnino. The portraits are currently housed at the Museum Correale of Sorrento. Pascaletti moved back to Calabria in the mid-18th century, where he worked for many churches in several Calabrian towns and cities, including Fuscaldo, Falconara Albanese, Rende, Mendicino and San Lucido. Pascaletti was also active in his hometown, Fiumefreddo Bruzio, where he married Teresa De Ponzo in 1747. They had five children together.

Hat making in Luton  At the beginning of the 1800s the Napoleonic Wars blocked imports of straw plait and hats from the continent so Luton's businessmen and women set up factories both large and small to supply local and national markets with straw hats. As a result, the town expanded significantly in size and population from the mid 1800s onwards. Between the mid 19th and mid 20th centuries the hatting industry so dominated the town that hat-making became synonymous with Luton. The Wright family have been involved in the manufacture of hats continuously for 300 years in Luton and the current Albion Road factory, which was founded by Walter Wright in 1889 with his wife Minnie Susan, is alleged to be the first custom built hat factory in Luton without a residence.  Current activity  The current proprietor Philip Wright is the fourth generation of his family to manufacture hats at the original site. After serving his apprenticeship Philip went on to study at the London College of Fashion which gave Walter Wright's traditional designs a new lease of life. Originally a major supplier to high street shops, demands from the retail industry worldwide for constantly cheaper prices and mass-produced product has forced the company of Walter Wright to focus on the bespoke high end of the market. The factory is one of the last from the Victorian era in the UK to have all its original equipment and manufacturing processes intact and Philip runs regular 'Factory Tours' so the public can see hats being made from beginning to end. Philip also gives regular speeches on the Luton Hat Trade to social groups, historical societies, schools, colleges and universities. The heritage of the factory has made Walter Wright Hats and Philip a popular subject for many TV programs including Salvage Hunters and Michael Portillo's Great British Railway Journeys. Walter Wright's long association with the Royal Family making hats for HRH The Princess Royal and Bearskin hats for the Coldstream Guards has led to royal visits including from HRH Prince Charles.

He was most known for leading the empire's restoration movement against the state of Han Zhao in Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö, present-day Zhenyuan, Gansu) following the Disaster of Yongjia in 311. However, his untimely death the next year undermined the potential of the group, as power would fall into Suo Lin and Qu Yun, who held on desperately to their influence on Emperor Min of Jin in Chang'an.  Life  Jia Ya was from Wuwei Commandary in modern-day Gansu. His great-grandfather was the famed advisor of the warlord Cao Cao, Jia Xu who helped lay the foundation of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms. In his youth, he was well-respected by the people for his talents and openness to them. He joined the Jin government, and rose to the rank of Administrator of Anding. Jia Ya was also involved in the War of the Eight Princes in 306, in which he sided with Sima Yue against Sima Yong by killing his generals Ma Zhan and Liang Mai.(ÂºòËæ≤Â§™ÂÆàË£¥Âªô„ÄÅÁß¶ÂúãÂÖßÂè≤Ë≥àÈæï„ÄÅÂÆâÂÆöÂ§™ÂÆàË≥àÁñãÁ≠âËµ∑ÂÖµÊìäÈ°íÔºåÊñ¨È¶¨Áûª„ÄÅÊ¢ÅÈÇÅ„ÄÇÁñãÔºåË©°‰πãÊõæÂ≠´‰πü„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 86 During the reign of Emperor Huai of Jin in 311, the Inspector of Yongzhou, Ding Chuo (‰∏ÅÁ∂Ω) slandered Jia Ya to the Prince of Nanyang, Sima Mo (Âè∏È¶¨Ê®°). Jia Ya was also hosting the rebel Pei Bao (Ë£¥Ëãû), who had opposed Sima Mo. Jia Ya fled to the Lu River, where he befriended two tribal men named Peng Dangzhong (ÂΩ≠Ëï©‰ª≤) and Dou Shou (Á´áÈ¶ñ). Together, they helped Jia Ya return to Anding, where they killed Sima Mo's general Xie Ban (Ë¨ùÁè≠) and forced Ding Chuo to flee to Wudu. The emperor forgave Jia Ya and appointed him the new Inspector of Yongzhou.(Ë≥àÁñãÔºåÂ≠óÂΩ•Â∫¶ÔºåÊ≠¶Â®Å‰∫∫ÔºåÈ≠èÂ§™Â∞âË©°‰πãÊõæÂ≠´‰πü„ÄÇÂ∞ëÊúâÂøóÁï•ÔºåÂô®ÊúõÁîöÂÅâÔºåË¶ã‰πãËÄÖËé´‰∏çÊÇÖÈôÑÔºåÁâπÁÇ∫Ê≠¶Â§´‰πãÊâÄÁûª‰ª∞ÔºåÈ°òÁÇ∫Ëá¥ÂëΩ„ÄÇÂàùËæüÂÖ¨Â∫úÔºåÈÅÇÊõÜÈ°ØËÅ∑ÔºåÈÅ∑ÂÆâÂÆöÂ§™ÂÆà„ÄÇÈõçÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤‰∏ÅÁ∂ΩÔºåË≤™Ê©´Â§±ÁôæÂßìÂøÉÔºå‰πÉË≠ñÁñã‰∫éÂçóÈôΩÁéãÊ®°ÔºåÊ®°‰ª•ËªçÂè∏Ë¨ùÁè≠‰ºê‰πã„ÄÇÁñãÂ•îÁÄòÊ∞¥ÔºåËàáËÉ°ÂΩ≠Ëï©‰ª≤ÂèäÊ∞êÁ´áÈ¶ñÁµêÁÇ∫ÂÖÑÂºüÔºåËÅöÁúæÊîªÁè≠„ÄÇÁ∂ΩÂ•îÊ≠¶ÈÉΩÔºåÁñãÂæ©ÂÖ•ÂÆâÂÆöÔºåÊÆ∫Áè≠„ÄÇÊπ£Â∏ù‰ª•ÁñãÁÇ∫È©ÉÈ®éÂ∞áËªç„ÄÅÈõçÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÔºåÂ∞ÅÈÖíÊ≥âÂÖ¨„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 60 Later that year, the forces of Han Zhao took over Luoyang and captured the emperor as well. Soon, Chang'an also capitulated after Sima Mo was captured and executed. Jia Ya and many of the tribal leaders around Anding sent their officials' children over to Luoyang to submit to Han Zhao. However, they did not reach the capital, rather they were led home by Sima Mo's subordinates Suo Lin and Qu Yun, who were fleeing from Han Zhao forces. Suo Lin, Qu Yun and the others discussed plans to restore Jin's authority in the north, and they all agreed to have Jia Ya lead them. Jia Ya accepted the position of General Who Pacifies the West.(ÁñãÂ∏•ÊàéÊôâ‰∫åËê¨È§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÂ∞á‰ºêÈï∑ÂÆâÔºåË•øÂπ≥Â§™ÂÆàÁ´∫ÊÅ¢‰∫¶Âõ∫ÂÆàÔºåÂäâÁ≤≤ËÅû‰πãÔºå‰ΩøÂäâÊõú„ÄÅÂäâÈõÖÂèäË∂ôÊüìË∑ùÁñãÔºåÂÖàÊîªÊÅ¢Ôºå‰∏çÂÖãÔºåÁñãÈÇÄÊìäÔºåÂ§ßÊïó‰πãÔºåÊõú‰∏≠ÊµÅÁü¢ÔºåÈÄÄËµ∞„ÄÇÁñãËøΩ‰πãÔºåËá≥ÊñºÁîòÊ≥â„ÄÇÊóãËá™Ê∏≠Ê©ãË•≤Ëï©‰ª≤ÔºåÊÆ∫‰πã„ÄÇ) Book of jin, Volume 60 Jia Ya set out with his army to Chang'an.

Jia Ya fought Liu Yao at Huangqiu (in present-day Tai'erzhuang District, Shandong), where he greatly routed his army. He then marched to attack his old friend, Peng Dangzhong and killed him. Jia Ya's success convinced many in the Guanxi (ÈóúË•ø, west of Hangu Pass) to surrender to him as well, returning it under the Jin dynasty. Not long after, Jia Ya and his group received Yan Ding and the nephew of the captured emperor, Sima Ye.

Description  The Tofts rise to 8m above Ordnance Datum at Sailholme, 7m at Wainfleet All Saints and 5‚Äì6m along much of the rest of the feature's length. This is considerably higher than the Low Grounds to the north (often 2‚Äì3m above Ordnance Datum), and the Marsh which separates the Tofts from the seafront and sits at 3‚Äì4m above Ordnance Datum.Simmons (2015), pp. 10-11. While the name the Tofts refers to the structure as a whole, parts of it are known as Wainfleet Tofts, Friskney Tofts and Wrangle Tofts, after the main villages which occupy its length.  History = Origin  The origin of the Tofts is unclear. It is probable that in the Roman period of occupation, the terrain between Sibsey and East and West Keal represented the edge of a basin which contained fenland, salt marshes and tidal flats.Simmons (2015), p. 11. The British Geological Survey states that the sea-facing edge of the Tofts is made of storm beach deposits.\\"Geology of Britain\\" (map), British Geological Survey. Retrieved 27 August 2020. Scholars working on the Fenland Project have suggested that the tidal system present in the Wash would not usually produce a barrier island and that the Tofts was therefore likely created through human processes. Regardless, by c. AD 500 a sand bar running the length of the Tofts was in place.  Human habitation  There is limited evidence for human settlement at the site before the 11th century. By the 11th century Friskney, Wolmersty and Wrangle were established on the raised ground, while Wainfleet had formed on a roddon by the north-eastern end. The Tofts acted as a sea defence;Simmons (2015), p. 16. the former path running along the length of the Tofts (variously called High Street, Highgate and Saltersgate) is described as a sea-dyke by H. E. Hallam.Hallam (1965), p. 76. Salt-making took place in the proximity during the Middle Ages; between Leake and Wainfleet, there were 56 salterns mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and there are many subsequent documentary references to salt-production among the medieval inhabitants.Simmons (2015), pp. 11‚Äì20.Some discussion of the medieval industry is also in Hallam (1965), pp. 76‚Äì77. The long strips of land occupied by salters (tofts) provide the name for the feature. The process of producing salt from salt marsh also gradually led to the accretion of wastes in the havens at Wrangle, Wainfleet and Friskney, as well as along the estuaries at the havens and along the Tofts's seaward side.Simmons (2017), p. 44. The geographer Ian Simmons has argued that this process and the presence of salterns along much of the coast led to the \\"seawards movement\\" of a coastline composed of salterns. The top 2‚Äì3m of the Tofts, which are composed of silt and sands, are probably human deposits and the remnants waste from these salt- making activities. Gradually, the mounds of salt waste atop The Tofts were turned into flat farming land, but the timing is not known.Simmons (2015), p. 22. The salt-making industry suffered under storms in the late 16th century and stopped in the area in the early 17th century; the sea-facing Marsh was also gradually extended as reclamation took place from the 17th century.Simmons (2015), pp. 9, 16. 19th-century maps show many long, thin field boundaries which likely reflect the location of former salterns; in some areas, the former medieval salt-cotes have been replaced with farms and houses.

It had first been isolated in 1934 from the marine annelid Lumbriconereis heteropoda and acts by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Researchers at Takeda in Japan investigated it as a possible insecticide. They subsequently developed a number of derivatives that were commercialised, including those with the ISO common names bensultap, cartap, thiocyclam and thiosultap.  Structures and synthesis  Bensultap.svgbensultap Thiocyclam neutral.svgthiocyclam Thiosultap.svgthiosultap Bensultap (R=SO2Ph) was made by the reaction of the sodium salt of benzenethiolsulfonate (PhSO2SNa) with N,N-dimethyl 1,3-dichloro-2-propylamine or N,N-dimethyl 2,3-dichloropropylamine in ethanol. :600px Bensultap can be converted to nereistoxin by treatment with alkali. History Japanese fishermen used the annelid worm Lumbriconereis heteropoda Marenz as bait and after accidental poisonings the chemical agent responsible was identified and named nereistoxin. In the 1960s, researchers at Takeda Chemical Industries synthesised the active material N,N-Dimethyl-1,2-dithiolan-4-amine and derivatives in which the sulfur-sulfur bond of the dithiolane ring was replaced by alternative sulfur-linked groups. The resulting compounds were in many cases less toxic to mammals than the natural product while retaining good activity on insects. It was subsequently shown that all the compounds which were commercialised acted by being propesticides ‚Äî breaking down in the environment to nereistoxin or its uncyclised dithiol.  Mechanism of action  Nereistoxin has chemical similarity to acetylcholine and its mode of action was suggested originally as being possibly by interference with acetylcholinesterase. Later electrophysiological studies using synapses from the cockroach Periplaneta americana showed that it acts by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor / ion channel complex in the insect central nervous system. This is also the mode of action of the related insecticides, all of which can produce the dithiol corresponding to cleavage of the 1,2-thiolane ring in the parent compound.  Usage  None of the insecticidal analogues of nereistoxin became major products in agriculture and their use was mainly limited to Japanese and Chinese cultivation of rice, where their control of pests such as the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis was significant. They were not licensed for use in Europe or the USA. The limited success of this group of chemicals was due in part to other compounds of a similar mode of action but higher potency and mammalian safety becoming available.

A young readers edition was published by Philomel Books on May 7, 2019. Contents Harris details her life as the daughter of immigrants, born in Oakland, California and raised in West Berkeley. She describes her childhood neighborhood as \\" a close-knit neighborhood of working families who were focused on doing a good job, paying the bills, and being there for one another.\\" Harris would eventually become San Francisco district attorney. Her decision to become a prosecutor was so she could serve \\"the victims of crimes committed and the victims of a broken criminal justice system.\\" Understanding this dichotomy, Harris describes herself as a progressive prosecutor. She elaborates: The book continues on through her time as California Attorney General, her face-off against fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez in the 2016 U.S. Senate election, and ends with her touting her fights against the Trump administration. Reception Kirkus Reviews compared the book favorably to Barack Obama's 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father. Likewise, Library Journal praised Harris for \\"[using] her life story to argue for a new way of treating our problems.\\" Other contemporary reviews were more mixed. Comparing the book to Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, Hannah Giorgis of the The Atlantic said Harris lacked Obama's literary finesse for both biography and political vision. Similarly, Danielle Kurtzleben of NPR criticized the awkward prose and lack of strong anecdotes. One such instance: Harris's brief mention of initially struggling to pass the bar exam could have been expanded into a more interesting narrative about perseverance. However, both reviewers agreed that the book served as a sufficient launching point for a potential presidential campaign. Indeed, Harris would announce her 2020 presidential campaign later that January. In a retrospective review, Carlos Lozada of The Washington Post echoed similar sentiments, while noting that Harris's kind words about the late Beau Biden (whose tenure as Delaware Attorney General overlapped with Harris's tenure in California) was a likely factor in Joe Biden's decision to select her as his 2020 campaign running mate.

High school career Kimble attended Saints John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic High School in Philadelphia, where he was teammates with Quade Green. Kimble averaged 11.4 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as a junior. As a senior, he averaged 14.5 points per game, helping Neumann-Goretti achieve a 28-2 record and its second straight PIAA Class AAA state championship. Kimble earned first team All-Catholic League, Pennsylvania Sportswriters All-State Class AAA and All-USA Pennsylvania honors. He signed with Saint Joseph's out of high school. College career As a freshman, Kimble averaged 6.0 points and 2.5 assists per game to help St. Josephs finish 28-8 and reach the second round of the NCAA Tournament. He was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Rookie Team. As a sophomore, Kimble averaged 15.5 points and 4.5 assists per game, sixth best in the Atlantic 10, but missed the final seven games of the season after injuring the fifth metatarsal of his left foot. In the first game of the 2017-18 season, Kimble scored 10 points against Toledo but re-injured his foot, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season. Kimble averaged 15.6 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game as a redshirt junior, but struggled with his three-point shooting, hitting 29 percent of his attempts. He missed 10 games with a hand injury but earned Second Team All-Philadelphia Big 5 honors. The team finished 14-19, and Kimble opted to transfer for his final season of eligibility after St. Joseph's fired coach Phil Martelli. After receiving interest from several schools, Kimble transferred to Louisville due to his familiarity with assistant coach Luke Murray and the success of graduate transfer Christen Cunningham the previous season. According to ESPN, Kimble was the 10th best transfer. As a senior at Louisville, Kimble averaged 5.0 points, 2.7 assists, and 1.5 rebounds per game. Professional career On August 25, 2020, Kimble signed his first professional contract with the Worcester Wolves of the British Basketball League.

One of the most honored singers of Sri Lanka, Amara is the first Professor of Music in Sri Lanka.  Personal life  Amara was born on 22 August 1939 in Batuwatta, Gampaha as the fifth child of the family with eleven siblings. Her father, Don Wiyolis Kasthuriarachchi was the Head Master of the Hanwella Primary School. Her mother, Dona Alpinona Meegahapola was a housewife. Her father was from Batuwatta and my mother was from Mathugama. She was educated at Hanwella Primary School and later attended to Hanwella Rajasinghe Central College. She played netball and attended other activities at school including learning ballet under maestro Wasantha Kumara. She was married to Dr. Dayarathna Ranatunga (born as Ranatunga Arachchige Dayarathna Ranatunga) where they got registered on 8 August 1963 and celebrated wedding on 30 January 1964. Dayarathna was born on 29 October 1940 as the youngest child to a family of six in Nawala, Nugegoda. His father Charles Peter Ranatunga was a school principal and his mother Dona Maslin Kolombage was a housewife. He completed education from Ananda Sastralaya, Kotte. After SSC exam, he attended to Zahira College, Colombo and studied in the Maths stream. In 1964, he was selected to a research officer post at the Tyre Corporation. Without any satisfaction from the career, he again moved to music where he was invited for Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). In 1969, Dayarathna joined with SLBC as the first Producer in the Music Unit where he was promoted as the Head of Department - Controller of Sinhala Music in 1978. Dayarathna's elder sister, Somalatha Ranatunga is also a singer. Dayarathna's maternal uncle D. M. Kolambage was the first Sinhala announcer at the Radio Ceylon. The couple has two sons: Nanditha Sarada, Pulasthi Indika and a daughter, Kumudumathie Rupashika. Their son, Pulasthi sang the song Senpathiyan Gena Nawpathiyan Gena with mother Amara at the age of eight. Nanditha is married to Sadhana Abeysekara, who is the granddaughter of late songstress Wasantha Sandanayake. Sadhana's sister, Supriya is also a popular singer in Sri Lanka. On 16 October 2018, Amara died at the age of 79 while receiving treatment at a private hospital for a heart attack. Her remains were brought to the University of the Visual & Performing Arts at 1.00 pm and later the final rites were held at the Borella General Cemetery on 18 October 2018. Career She started her singing career at the age of eight or ten with the first song Yamuna Yamuna Sobana Yamuna. She got the opportunity to sing in a play after recognizing Ananda Sarath Wimalaweera and U. A. S. Perera in her college days, who were involved in the radio service during this period. She got the opportunity of singing according to the music of the musician Lionel Edirisinghe, and playing a role in the play Keppetipola produced by the program 'Lama Uyana' presented by Sarath Wimalaweera. She was an artist in the \\"Lama Uyana\\" program in 1948-49 and soon sang a motherly song under the scholar B. S. Wijeratne. In 1950, she had the opportunity to act in Wasantha Kumara's play Sanda Kinduru. While in the school in 1952, Amara joined Heywood and mastered classical music under B. S. Wijeratne. Both Amara and Dayarathna began studying classical music at the age of twelve. Dayarathna was the first male student of Heywood, whereas Amara was the first female student. At the end of the six-year course at the Heywood College of Music, Amara and Dayaratne got teaching appointments at the age of 18. Amara was appointed to the Meegoda Central College and Dayaratne received the appointment at Richmond College, Galle. She continued to work as a teacher for 43 years. In 1961, Amara entered Bhatkhande University in India. After returning to Sri Lanka in 1964, she worked as a lecturer at the Government College of Music on 1 February. Meanwhile, she became a graduate of the Banaras Hindu University and later served as the Head of the Department of Aesthetics at the University of Kelaniya for some time. She studied \\"Dhrupad\\" vocal methods under Prof. Ritwik Sanyal and \\"Khyal\\" singing from Dr. Chitta Ranjan Jyothish. After the Department of Fine Arts was later transformed into the University of the Visual and Performing Arts, Amara also served as its Professor and Head of the Department. In 1986, she started her career in music professionally. Due to her excellence in the field of classical research music, she also became its Head of Department and later promoted to professor in 1995. For her doctorate, she composed own classical melodies for 34 Hindi lyrics and 10 Sinhala songs. Her first duet came with her husband, Maha Ra Yame. Later, she sang several popular classical songs such as Selalihiniyo Numba Danne Na, Eye Ra Oba Sihinen, Radha Krishna and Amara Devi. Apart from that, she wrote several books such as Amara Geetha, Sarasa Sambhava, Saundarya Avabodhaya and Sambhavya Sangeethaya. In 1997, to commemorate the 55th Independence of India, the Indian Government awarded \\"Bharatha Mithra\\" to the Amara and her husband Dayarathna. From 1997 to 2001, Dayarathna and Amara became lecturers on North Indian Classical music in the Ethno Musicology Department at the California University. On 6 December 2007, a felicitation ceremony \\"Maha Re Yame, Dayaratna-Amara Abhinandana\\" was held at 6.30 p.m. at BMICH. On 17 August 2011, a CD containing new songs was released at 5 pm in the Ananda Samarakoon studio of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. On that day, Yapa Bandara Seneviratne's book \\"Sinhala Sangeethaye Dayaratne Ranatunga Suvipul Siyatsara\\" was also released.

Direct collapse black holes are high-mass black hole seeds, putatively formed within the redshift range 15, when the Universe was about 100-250 million years old. Unlike seeds formed from the first population of stars (also known as Population III stars), direct collapse black hole seeds are formed by a direct, general relativistic instability. They are very massive, with a typical mass at formation of ~. This category of black hole seeds was originally proposed theoretically to alleviate the challenge in building supermassive black holes already at redshift z \\\\sim 7, as numerous observations to date have confirmed. __TOC__  Formation  Direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are massive black hole seeds theorized to have formed in the high-redshift Universe and with typical masses at formation of ~, but spanning between and . The environmental physical conditions to form a DCBH (as opposed to a cluster of stars) are the following: # Metal-free gas (gas containing only hydrogen and helium). # Atomic-cooling gas. # Sufficiently large flux of Lyman-Werner photons, in order to destroy hydrogen molecules, which are very efficient gas coolants. The previous conditions are necessary to avoid gas cooling and, hence, fragmentation of the primordial gas cloud. Unable to fragment and form stars, the gas cloud undergoes to a gravitational collapse of the entire structure, reaching extremely large values of the matter density at the core, of the order of \\\\sim 10^7 g/cm^3. At this density, the object undergoes to a general relativistic instability, which leads to the formation of a black hole of a typical mass ~, and up to 1 million solar masses. The occurrence of the general relativistic instability, as well as the absence of the intermediate stellar phase, led to the denomination of direct collapse black hole. In other words, these objects collapse directly from the primordial gas cloud, not from a stellar progenitor as prescribed in standard black hole models.  Demography  Direct collapse black holes are generally thought to be extremely rare objects in the high- redshift Universe, because the three fundamental conditions for their formation (see above in section Formation) are challenging to be met all together in the same gas cloud. Current cosmological simulations suggest that DCBHs could be as rare as only ~1 per cubic Giga-parsec at redshift 15. The prediction on their number density is highly dependent on the minimum flux of Lyman-Werner photons required for their formation and can be as large as \\\\sim 10^7 DCBHs per cubic Giga-parsec in the most optimistic scenarios.  Detection  In 2016, a team led by Harvard University astrophysicist Fabio Pacucci identified the first two candidate direct collapse black holes, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The two candidates, both at redshift z > 6, were found in the CANDELS GOODS-S field and matched the spectral properties predicted for this type of astrophysical sources. In particular, these sources are predicted to have a significant excess of infrared radiation, when compared to other categories of sources at high redshift. Additional observations, in particular with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, will be crucial to investigate the properties of these sources and confirm their nature.

They form the most general definition of goal-directed proof-search‚Äîin which someone chooses a formula and performs hereditary reductions until the result meets some condition. The extremal case where reduction only terminates when axioms are reached forms the sub-family of uniform proofs. A sequent calculus is said to have the focusing property when focused proofs are complete for some terminating condition. For System LK, System LJ, and System LL, uniform proofs are focused proofs where all the atoms are assigned negative polarity. Many other sequent calculi has been shown to have the focusing property, notably the nested sequent calculi of both the classical and intuitionistic variants of the modal logics in the S5 cube.  Uniform proofs  In the sequent calculus for an intuitionistic logic, the uniform proofs can be characterised as those in which the upward reading performs all right rules before the left rules. Typically, uniform proofs are not complete for the logic i.e., not all sequents or formulas admit a uniform proof, so one considers fragments where they are complete e.g., the hereditary Harrop fragment of Intuitionistic logic. Due to the deterministic behaviour, uniform proof-search has been used as the control mechanism defining the programming language paradigm of logic programming. Occasionally, uniform proof-search is implemented in a variant of the sequent calculus for the given logic where context management is automatic thereby increasing the fragment for which one can define a logic programming langue.  Focused proofs  The focusing principle was originally classified through the disambiguation between synchronous and asynchronous connective in Linear Logic i.e., connectives that interact with the context and those that do not, as consequence of research on logic programming. They are now an increasingly important example of control in reductive logic, and can drastically improve proof-search procedures in industry. The essential idea of focusing is to identify and coalesce the non-deterministic choices in a proof, so that a proof can be seen as an alternation of negative phases ( where invertible rules are applied eagerly), and positive phases (where applications of the other rules are confined and controlled).  Polarisation  According to the rules in the sequent calculus, formulas are canonically put into one of two classes called positive and negative e.g., in LK and LJ the formula \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi is positive. The only freedom is over atoms are assigned a polarity freely. For negative formulas provability is invariant under the application of a right rule; and, dually, for a positive formulas provability is invariant under the application of a left rule. In either case one can safely apply rules in any order to hereditary sub-formulas of the same polarity. In the case of a right rule applied to a positive formula, or a left rule applied to a negative formula, one may result in invalid sequents e.g., in LK and LJ there is no proof of the sequent B \\\\lor A \\\\implies A \\\\lor B beginning with a right rule. A calculus admits the focusing principle if when an original reduct was provable then the hereditary reducts of the same polarity are also provable. That is, one can commit to focusing on decomposing a formula and its sub-formulas of the same polarity without loss of completeness.  Focused system  A sequent calculus is often shown to have the focusing property by working in a related calculus where polarity explicitly controls which rules apply. Proofs in such systems are in focused, unfocused, or neutral phases, where the first two are characterised by hereditary decomposition; and the latter by forcing a choice of focus. One of the most important operational behaviours a procedure can undergo is backtracking i.e., returning to an earlier stage in the computation where a choice was made. In focused systems for classical and Intuitionistic logic, the use of backtracking can be simulated by pseudo-contraction. Let \\\\uparrow and \\\\downarrow denote change of polarity, the former making a formula negative, and the latter positive; and call a formula with an arrow neutral. Recall that \\\\lor is positive, and consider the neutral polarized sequent \\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi \\\\implies \\\\uparrow \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi, which is interpreted as the actual sequent \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi \\\\implies \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi. For neutral sequents such as this, the focused system forces on to make an explicit choice of which formula to focus on, denoted by \\\\langle \\\\, \\\\rangle . To perform a proof-search the best thing is to chose the left formula, since \\\\lor is positive, indeed (as discussed above) in some cases there are no proofs where the focus is on the right formula. To overcome this, some focused calculi create a backtracking point such that focusing on the right yields \\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi \\\\implies \\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi \\\\rangle, \\\\uparrow \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi, which is still as \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi \\\\implies \\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi. The second formula on the right can be removed only when the focused phase has finished, but if proof-search gets stuck before this happens the sequent may remove the focused component thereby returning to the choice e.g., \\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow B \\\\lor A \\\\implies \\\\langle A \\\\rangle, \\\\uparrow A \\\\lor B must be taken to \\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow B \\\\lor A \\\\implies \\\\uparrow A \\\\lor B as no other reductive inference can be made. This is a pseudo-contraction since it has the syntactic form of a contraction on the right, but the actual formula doesn't exist i.e., in the interpretation of the proof in the focused system the sequent has only one formula on the right.

He also used to involve the lovers in substance abuse. He carried his first con at an apparent age of 14. Sometimes, he collected money by delivering public speeches at religious places and civil societies such as local churches and organizations without revealed his real name.  Biography  He was born around 1888 in Central Falls, Rhode Island. His father was a carpenter. He is also known as Prince Tewanna Ray. He went to England at an apparent age of 34 to arrange a meeting with Edward VIII following his unpaid bills and police investigation. He first played \\"Red Indian\\" characters around 1917 and used to travel from one city to another. He also delivered motivational speeches to businessmen and soldiers. He knew more than 21 languages which he used to indulge leaders, businessmen, kings, queens and world class leaders, and also pretended as an activist while collecting donations for the promotion of \\"Indian rights\\". He later went to Switzerland where he was arrested by the Swiss police for his involvement in confidential tricks in the country. He was sentenced to a one year in prison, and later in October 1925 when he was released, he went to Italy where he was sentenced to a seven years in prison with a fine of over 1 million Italian lira, however he was released after four years.  Cons  Prior to his arrest, he went to Europe where he acted in a film titled La caravane vers l‚ÄôOuest under the pseudonym Chief White Elk. In 1924, he went to Italy and presented himself as a delegation member of the League of Nations. His traditional dress made him famous in Italy, and earned him honour from the fascist rulers of Italy. Later in 1926, he was convicted by a court in Turin for his involvement in frauds. He, according to uncertain claims tried to justify himself stating \\"I'm an actor, I just did what people expected me to do\\".  Personal life  He also posed as Chief White Elk which helped him to marry a woman of Utah named Burtha Thompson. His marriage was attended by the governor, believing he was real Chief White Elk.

Morrison (1805 ‚Äì December 20, 1880) was an American banker who worked at the Bank of the Manhattan Company for more than forty years as teller, cashier and, finally, president from 1860 to 1879. Early life Morrison was born in 1805 to Scotch parents in New Orleans, Louisiana, where his father had a winter residence. When he was still young, his father, a Louisiana planter, died which led to James and his mother returning to her native city of Aberdeen, Scotland. There, he was \\"carefully educated according to the rigid methods employed in the schools of that country.\\" In 1825, at the age of 19, Morrison decided to return to the United States to begin his career. Career Manhattan Company (1799-1955) letterhead c. 1922 As a clerk in the United States and Merchant's Banks, Morrison became familiar with the banking system. In 1840, he joined the Bank of the Manhattan Company when it was still located in a brownstone at 40 Wall Street. He started his more than forty-year career with the Manhattan Company as its first teller, two years later in 1842 he was promoted to cashier and, worked \\"assiduously to improve the stock, which at that time was worth from 45 to 50 cents on the dollar.\\" The board of directors elected him president of the Bank in 1860. According to his obituary in The New York Times: > \\"During the unsettled condition of business affairs which succeeded the war, > Mr. Morrison manifested a shrewdness and ability which enabled him to > survive the financial crash that ultimately resulted in the suspension of > many other banking institutions.\\" In the latter part of 1879, his health began to decline and he resigned the presidency, although he continued to serve on the board of directors. Morrison was succeeded by John S. Harberger, who died of malarial fever a year later in October 1880. Personal life Morrison was the father of David Mitchell Morrison (b. 1841), who served as president of the Washington Trust Company, and founded the banking firm of Morrison & Putnam. He married Abby Putnam, a daughter of Capt. Nathaniel Putnam of Brooklyn, in 1877. He died on December 20, 1880 at 158 West 23rd Street, his residence in Manhattan.

Doing so enables a sustainable long-term harvest of seaweeds and seafood, while regenerating life in the ocean. Marine Permaculture comprises a platform from which seaweed ecosystems can be grown, creating the environmental conditions for primary production and habitat for marine life. Using a system of renewably powered pumps, cool, nutrient-rich waters are brought up from a depth of 100-500 meters, below the nutricline, to the ocean surface, thereby replicating natural overturning circulation processes of ocean upwelling and mitigating against marine heatwaves that have led to ocean stratification and decimated natural macroalgae ecosystems in many regions of the world. In addition, artificial structures provide substrate seaweeds require to grow on. The seaweed growth and increased plankton provide critical marine habitat for fish populations to thrive. This type of intervention regenerates overturning circulation and returns mixed layer temperatures to levels closer to those measured pre-industrially. Marine Permaculture has received endorsement from a number of permaculture experts, including Morag Gamble of the Permaculture Education Institute, Matt Powers, David Holmgren and the Santa Barbara Permaculture Network, who have recognised its adherence to the principles of permaculture. It has also received considerable attention as a potentially ground-breaking climate solution. It has featured as a ‚ÄúComing Attraction‚Äù solution in the book Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming edited by Paul Hawken and was one of the main climate solutions featured in Damon Gameau‚Äôs documentary film 2040. Professor Tim Flannery has also highlighted Marine Permaculture‚Äôs potential in sequestering gigatons of carbon through hectare scale platforms in the open ocean , an idea that has also received attention from the voluntary carbon market Nori . Marine Permaculture is also mentioned as a climate solution in Burn: Using Fire to Cool the Earth by Albert Bates and Kathleen Draper. Marine Permaculture also features in the MacArthur Foundation's Bold Solutions Network, of the ‚ÄúTop100‚Äù innovative solutions to the world‚Äôs most pressing challenges . If deployed at scale, it has the potential to provide food security to billions of people who rely upon the oceans for their primary source of protein, act as a source of blue carbon, while lowering ocean acidification, providing sustainable livelihoods, and restoring marine habitat. To date, Marine Permaculture trials have been conducted in numerous regions of the world including Hawaii, the Philippines, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Tasmania, where it is being used to regenerate seaweed ecosystems recently decimated from climate change. Moreover, the company C-Combinator has obtained intellectual property rights for the technology and is intending to begin commercial operations of Marine Permaculture systems in the near future. Marine Permaculture was created by Dr. Brian von Herzen and colleagues at the Climate Foundation in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

He studied the piano with Franz Liszt, who made him also his secretary and companion on concert tours. G√∂llerich is known for studying the life and work of Anton Bruckner whose secretary and friend he was. He initiated and conducted concerts of Bruckner's music in Linz, and wrote an influential biography.  Life  Born in Linz, the son of the Wels town secretary and later member of the Reich Council and State Parliament and his wife Maria, n√©e Nowotny, G√∂llerich grew up in middle- class circumstances. His father was a member of a liberal writers and literary association in Wels. G√∂llerich attended the Linz Realschule, which he completed with the Matura. He studied mathematics at the University of Vienna, as his father wished. In 1882, he attended the Bayreuth Festival. After his father's death in 1883, he devoted himself entirely to music, studying in Vienna the piano with Toni Raab, and composition with Anton Bruckner. Raab introduced him to Franz Liszt in 1984, who accepted him as a piano student. He recognized G√∂llerich's literary and pianistic talent, and made him his secretary and travel companion, on concert tours to Germany, Italy and Russia. After Liszt's death in 1886, he worked as a music critic in Vienna. G√∂llerich became a secretary of Anton Bruckner. From 1890 until 1896, he was director of the Ramann-Volckmann'sche Musikschule, a music school in Nuremberg, together with his wife Gisela P√°szthory-Voigt, also a pianist and student of Liszt. One of her children from an earlier marriage was Casimir von P√°szthory. From 1896 until his death in 1923, G√∂llerich was director of the Linz Musikverein, which made him also the artistic director of the Musikverein concerts and choir master of the Schubertbund choir. He conducted the world premieres of many important works by Liszt and Bruckner in a series calles Bruckner Festkonzerte, making Linz a leading place for music. Authorized by Bruckner, he wrote a biography of the composer, covering not only his life but also a thorough analysis of his compositions. His work remained an influential biography of the composer, including views regarded later as problematic, such as \\"Musikant Gottes\\" (God's musician). G√∂llerich died in Linz.

Life and career = Provenance and early years  Gabriele Sch√∂ttler was born, a few months after the 1953 uprising, in Zehdenick, a small town and an important centre for brick production, set in the marshy flatlands roughly 50 km to the north of Berlin. She completed her school education at an East German \\"Polytechnic Secondary School\\" in 1970 and then transferred to the Medical College and Berlin-Buch where between 1970 and 1974 she trained and qualified for a nursing career. She then worked as a nurse at the Neurology Clinic in Berlin-Buch between 1974 and 1977. In 1977 she was promoted to the rank of a \\"deputy station sister\\" (\\"stellvertretende Stationsschwester\\"), continuing her work in the clinic at this level till 1979. An abrupt change of career came in 1979 when she took a post as head of training and further education at the \\"VEB Elektromontage\\" manufacturing facility at Oranienburg on the northern edge of Berlin. She worked in this position till 1983. Between 1980 and 1984 she undertook a parallel distance- learning course in business administration and economics with the Business College at Dippoldiswalde. Sch√∂ttler continued to work at Oranienburg in the training department at \\"VEB Elektromontage\\" between 1984 and 1991, but now with an \\"Ingenieur-√ñkonomin\\" degree to her name.  Politics  During the Autumn of changes in 1989 Gabriele Sch√∂ttler joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SPD in East Germany had been subsumed into the ruling SED (party) in April 1946 by means of a contentious party merger that had opened the way for the creation of a Soviet sponsored one-party dictatorship. The superficial plurality of political parties after 1949 had comprised a collection Bloc parties, all closely controlled by the one ruling party. During the second half of 1989 many of the structural underpinnings of the one-party dictatorship were falling away, however. A separate East German Social Democratic Party was relaunched, formally on 7 October 1989. Sch√∂ttler joined it. It was almost certainly the first time she had ever been a member of any political party. During the next twelve months, as the apparatus of dictatorship continued to crumble, and the East German SDP progressively merged into the (hitherto \\"West German\\") Social Democratic Party (SPD), she undertook a succession of party functions at district and state level. The East German general election of 18 March 1990 is widely seen as the first (and last) free and fair general election in the forty year history of the German Democratic Republic. For those who view history backwards it was also a step down the inevitable path to German reunification. Certainly over in Bonn Chancellor Kohl (who by this time enjoyed far more cordial relationship with Soviet party General Secretary Gorbachev than any member of the East German government leadership) already saw a clear road ahead whereby the forty years of German division might be ended. But in March 1990 there were still very few people in East or West Germany who foresaw realistic prospect of reunification. The realisation of what might become possible dawned on people only during the few months, however. There was nothing theoretical about the return of democracy to East Germany, and on 6 May 1990 Sch√∂ttler was elected to membership the East Berlin city assembly (\\"(Ost-)Berliner Stadtverordnetenversammlung\\"). By 11 July 1990, when this city parliament voted into force a constitution for East Berlin (to come into force on 23 July 1990) reunification was very much more clearly on the horizon, so that the East Berlin constitution was to be valid only for a six month transitional phase till January 1991, by which time it was anticipated that a longer term way ahead might be apparent. It was. Sch√∂ttler remained a member of the East Berlin city parliament till its replacement in December 1990.  Berlin reunited  The formal date of the reunification treaty was 3 October 1990. A couple of months later, on 2 December 1990, elections were held for a newly enlarged Berlin city parliament (\\"Abgeordnetenhaus\\"). The date was chosen because it was also the date selected for the first all-German national election since the Nazi show election of April 1938. In Berlin, once again a united city, Gabriele Sch√∂ttler was elected to the Berlin parliament as the SPD member for a city centre electoral district (\\"Wahlkreis Mitte 1\\" ). She remained a member for slightly more than ten years, representing central Berlin and serving between 1991 and 1995, and then again for a few months during 1998, as a deputy leader of the SPD group in the parliament.  Senator  In November 1998 she became a Berlin senator, taking the important portfolio encompassing labour, social affairs and women in the city administration of Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. She took the post in succession to Christine Bergmann, who had accepted an unexpected invitation from Chancellor Schr√∂der to make a switch into national politics. The next year her participation in the Berlin state election became particularly memorable, thanks to the poster accompanying her campaign slogan, \\"Gabi - [a] stronger step for social justice\\" (\\"... starker Auftritt f√ºr soziale Gerechtigkeit\\"). The poster was a pointed response to the campaign poster of Mayor Diepgen, her senatorial boss but political opponent in the governing coalition: Diepgen in his own election publicity had used an image featuring running shoes, to illustrate his energetic approach to his senatorial and mayoral responsibilities. The image accompanying Sch√∂ttler's own slogan simply showed an elegant foot and ankle encased in an exceptionally high stiletto shoe, of which the spike was piercing the toe section of a running shoe containing - the viewer was presumably intended to infer - a foot. Sch√∂ttler's poster- slogan combination caught the attention of the national media. Gabriele Sch√∂ttler is a small woman, and much of the ensuing press reporting centred not on her agenda for social justice in Berlin, but on the nature and extent of her personal shoe collection. Reassuringly, it was reported that she owned \\"nowhere near as many shoes as Imelda Marcos\\", but there were nevertheless around 40 pairs (including plenty of shoes and winter boots with very high heels). Despite the poster she retained her senatorial portfolio in Mayor Diepgen's following the 1999 election even though the election had delivered a small reduction in the SPD vote share, leading to a reduction in the number of senatorial seats allocated to it in the city's senate coalition. She also retained it when Mayor Diepgen was succeeded as mayor by her SPD colleague Klaus Wowerweit following the Berlin Bank scandal. However, the new administration proved unstable due to the underlying balance of seats in the Berlin parliament, and when fresh state elections were called for October 2001 she resigned her senate seat. Once the results were declared, it turned out that she had, in addition, failed to retain her seat in the city parliament, which went instead to a young university professor, Benjamin-Immanuel Hoff, of the PDS (party).  After politics?  Between 2002 and 2006 Sch√∂ttler headed up the \\"Sanssouci Business Academy\\", a recently opened private sector business school in Potsdam. Under her leadership the academy specialised in organising seminars for leaders from business and trades unions.  District mayor  In August 2005 it was reported that the party had approached her, requesting that she should apply to become the party candidate for the post of local mayor in Treptow-K√∂penick, in political terms a district of Berlin with a rich and long-standing socialist tradition. Beyond her obvious qualities, there were hints that the party hierarchy had been underwhelmed by the number and/or quality of the candidates who had already applied to the party district association. The deadline for applications was still two months away, however. Sch√∂ttler's reaction was cautiously positive, \\"if that is what the comrades want\\". By the time the reports appeared, it turned out that several members of the party district association had already nominated her as the party's candidate to succeed the long-standing and popular (but by this point three years past the normal retirement age) district mayor, Klaus Ulbricht. By the time of the local elections, which took place on 17 September 2006, Sch√∂ttler's name was at the top of the SPD party list for the Treptow-K√∂penick district council, which effectively guaranteed her election to the council. Six weeks later the new council convened, and was then up to the members of the new council to vote for a district mayor. 43 of the 55 voting chose Gabriele Sch√∂ttler who accordingly was duly elected. Within the district council she also took a leadership role in respect of finance, economics, arts and culture, personnel matters and regulatory affairs. Gabriele Sch√∂ttler served out her full term as district mayor, remaining in post till 27 October 2009. A particular high point during her term of office was the 800 anniversary celebrations for K√∂penick. Following her retirement it was reported that she remained engaged, in particular through her support for the welfare oriented \\"K√∂penick social foundation\\" (\\"Sozialstiftung K√∂penick\\").  Personal  Gabriele Sch√∂ttler is married with a son, born in the mid 1970s. Asked in 2009 how she spent her spare time she replied: \\"That belongs to my family\\". She added that she likes to spend time in her garden, and takes particular pleasure in reading crime-novels \\"provided it is not already clear from the beginning who the murderer was, as with Columbo\\".

After approximately twelve years incarcerated, having always maintained his innocence, his convictions along with his two co-defendants, Michael George Davis and Randolph Egbert Johnson, were ruled \\"unsafe\\" in July 2000 and they were released. Early life Rowe was born in south-east London to a Jamaican father and British mother. He has three older sisters. He was expelled from secondary school for poor behaviour. He has stated that he was badly behaved and at 17 he was arrested for and charged for burglary. He moved out of his parents' house at 19. Convictions In the early hours of 16 December 1988, three masked men, one carrying a knife, another a gun, beat and tied up a gay couple, Peter Hurburgh and Alan Eley, who were having sex in a car parked in a field. During the attack Hurburgh died of a heart attack. Later that morning they committed two home robberies and stabbed one of the occupants, 40-year-old Timothy Napier. Rowe and Davis were subsequently arrested on the morning of 19 December and Johnson on 6 January 1989. They were dubbed the M25 Three by the media, due to the locations of the crimes. They were interrogated for three days. The victims stated there were two white perpetrators and one black; however, all three defendants were black. They had also described an attacker with blue eyes and fair hair, neither of which matched any of the three accused. Rowe‚Äôs girlfriend at the time of the attack, Kate Williamson, testified against him at trial. She later sent him a letter in prison admitting and apologising for lying. In March 1990 the three were sentenced to life imprisonment without parole at the Old Bailey for murder and aggravated robbery. Appeal and release In 1994, Davis and Rowe made an application to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Along with errors and other evidence withheld before the trial, it had not been disclosed to Rowe's lawyers that the key prosecution witness, Norman Duncan, was a known criminal with previous convictions, and prior to the trial had become a police informant. On 16 February 2000, the ECHR returned their judgment and found that there had been a violation of Article 6 (1) of the ECHR, the right to a fair trial, and on 17 July 2000 Rowe and his accomplices were acquitted and released. The judge stated \\"This is not a finding of innocence, far from it.\\" Rowe has always maintained his innocence and has said he believes the police conspired with witnesses.  Career  During his incarceration Rowe studied journalism through a correspondence course and on his release joined the BBC in early 2001 as a reporter for BBC Radio 4. In 2003 Rowe began presenting various BBC programs and in 2006 joined BBC One Panorama. His Panorama documentary on the conviction of Barry George for the murder of Jill Dando was considered a significant factor in his eventual acquittal. He became freelance in 2016 and in 2017 he was one of the celebrities who walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain for the BBC Two series, Pilgrimage: The Road to Santiago. Rowe is currently a reporter on BBC One series The One Show and Sunday Morning Live. He hosted season 2, 3 and 4 of Inside the World's Toughest Prisons, commissioned by Netflix. In August 2020 he released his podcast Second Chance. His memoir and autobiography, Notorious, is set to be released in late 2020. He has attributed his success as a journalist to his conviction and incarceration for a crime he did not commit. Personal life Rowe had been dating a girl prior to being incarcerated. He has said that they got back in contact 2 months after his release. They had their first child in the summer of 2004. He stated in 2000 he has a son from a previous relationship, born around the time he was arrested, who upon his release he had never met. Rowe has said his son was reluctant to see him due to the accusations against him.

Completed and commissioned in 1942, she served in World War II, operating in the Aleutian Islands campaign and the Battle of Tarawa before she was sunk in November 1943. Construction and commissioning I-35 was laid down on 2 September 1940 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 143. Renamed I-45 by the time she was launched on 24 September 1941, she was renamed I-35 on 1 November 1941. She was completed and commissioned on 31 August 1942. Service history=Work-ups Upon commissioning, I-35 was attached to the Kure Naval District and proceeded from Kobe to Kure. On 1 September 1942, the Japanese activated the Kure Submarine Flotilla, and that day I-35 and the submarine were assigned to the new flotilla, with I-35 as the flagship of the flotilla's commander, Rear Admiral Tadashige Daigo. I-34 replaced her as the flagship on 4 September 1942. From 14 to 21 September 1942, I-34 and I-35 conducted work-ups in the Harima Nada in the Seto Inland Sea, during which a Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane assigned to I-35 was damaged beyond repair during launch-and-recovery exercises on 19 September 1942. The two submarines departed the Harima Nada on 21 September and returned to Kure on 23 September 1942. I-35 put to sea again on 6 October 1942 in company with I-34 and the depot ship Santos Maru to conduct joint exercises in the Suo Nada and the Iyo Nada in the Seto Inland Sea, returning to Kure on 13 October 1942. On 18 October 1942, she carried out torpedo attack exercises against a moving target and refueling exercises with Santos Maru. She again got underway from Kure on 19 October 1942 with I-34 and Santos Maru for joint exercises in the Iyo Nada and Bungo Strait, returning to Kure on 28 October 1942. Aleutian Islands campaign On 15 November 1942, I-34 and I-35 were reassigned to the Northern Force in the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands campaign. They departed Kure in company on 28 November 1942 bound for ≈åminato in northern Honshu, where they arrived on 1 December 1942. On 2 December 1942, I-35 got back underway to transport supplies to the Japanese garrison on Kiska in the Aleutian Islands. Arriving there on 8 December 1942, she unloaded her cargo and put back to sea the same day to patrol in an area of the North Pacific Ocean south of Amukta. She completed her patrol on 14 December and arrived at Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands on 20 December 1942. On 25 December 1942, I-35 set out from Paramushiro on another supply run to Kiska, calling there briefly on 31 December 1942 to discharge her cargo before moving to a patrol area in the Bering Sea northeast of Adak Island. On 7 January 1943, she received orders to divert to an area in the Bering Sea northeast of Attu to search for American cruisers that Japanese forces had sighted there. She did not find them, and on 10 January 1943 she moved to a patrol area in the North Pacific Ocean south of Kiska. She visited Kiska from 17 to 18 January, then got back underway to patrol in the North Pacific south of Kiska and Amchitka. The light cruiser and destroyer steamed through her patrol on their way to Kiska carrying supplies and sighted what they thought was an American submarine on 23 January 1943, raising a concern that their supply mission had been compromised and prompting them to abort it and return to base, not realizing until later that the submarine they sighted probably was I-35. I-35 moved to a new patrol area north of Constantine Harbor on Amchitka on 30 January 1943, and on 14 February 1943 visited Kiska to embark a staff officer of the North Sea Defense Force and transport him to Attu. After completing her patrol, she eventually returned to Japan. On 27 March 1943, I-35 departed Yokosuka. She arrived at Paramushiro on 1 April 1943 and was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the Northern Force that day. She got underway from Paramushiro on 3 April 1943 for her third supply run to Kiska, which she visited on 8 April to unload four tons of cargo and disembark staff officers of the 51st Base Force. She departed Kiska the same day and reached Paramushiro on 13 April 1943. I-35 departed Paramushiro on 16 April 1943 to make her first supply run to Attu, where she delivered supplies and ammunition and disembarked several Imperial Japanese Army staff officers on 20 April 1943 before getting back underway the same day to return to Paramushiro, which she reached on 24 April 1943. She put to sea again on 27 April 1943 for her fourth supply run to Kiska, where she unloaded her cargo on 1 May 1943. She returned to Paramushiro on 5 May 1943. The Battle of Attu began when U.S forces landed on Attu on 11 May 1943, and I-35 got underway for the Attu area. On 13 May 1943, the destroyer , screening the battleship off Attu, detected a stationary submarine on sonar. As Phelps was about to attack, the submarine suddenly changed speed and bearing, apparently attempting evasive maneuvers. Phelps dropped two depth charges, then lost contact. She regained contact at 15:30 and dropped five and four depth charges. Nearby, the light minelayer signaled confirmation that Phelps had hit the submarine and reported that a metal drum and a small diesel oil slick had come to the surface. The identity of the submarine Phelps attacked is unknown, but it probably was either I-34 or I-35, both of which were in the area at the time. A depth charge presumably had knocked the metal drum off the submarine's deck, but no Japanese submarine was sunk in the action. In foggy conditions on the morning of 15 May 1943, I-35 sighted Pennsylvania standing by as the attack transport unloaded off Holtz Bay on Attu. I-35 fired torpedoes at what she identified as a light cruiser and heard two explosions. At 11:40, four torpedoes passed astern of Pennsylvania and on either side of J. Franklin Bell. Two destroyers counterattacked, dropping 58 depth charges and inflicting serious damage on I-35. I-35 called at Paramushiro from 19 to 27 May 1943, then proceeded to Kure, which she reached at 17:00 on 2 June 1943. She later moved to Kobe where repairs to her damage began on 17 June 1943. Later operations With her repairs complete, I-35 departed Kure in mid-September 1943 and arrived at Truk on 18 September. On 11 October 1943, she set out from Truk on a war patrol in the area of Wake Island and Hawaii, and while at sea on 16 October 1943 was reassigned to Submarine Group A. At 00:32 on 17 October 1943, the submarine , which was en route Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after conducting a reconnaissance of Makin Island in the Gilbert Islands, sighted the conning tower of a submarine that looked to her commanding officer like that of a new-construction U.S. submarine, but he later received information that he had seen a Japanese submarine, which may have been I-35. After patrolling near Wake Island, I-35 received orders on 23 October 1943 to move to the Hawaii area. She was southwest of the Hawaiian Islands on 19 November 1943 when she was informed that Submarine Group A had been reactivated and received orders to proceed to Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands along with the submarines , , , and . On 20 November 1943, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign began with the U.S. invasion of Tarawa and of Makin. On 21 November 1943, I-35 reported sighting a U.S. Navy task force ‚Äî probably Task Group 53.6, consisting of the escort aircraft carriers , , and and the destroyers escorting them ‚Äî southwest of Tarawa. The Japanese never heard from her again and declared her missing that day. Loss On 23 November 1943, I-35 crash-dived off Tarawa Atoll when an aircraft attacked her with bombs at 05:20. Undamaged, she proceeded east. She was west of Betio that afternoon when the destroyer detected the sound of her propellers. The destroyer joined Meade, and between 15:30 and 17:38, the two destroyers attacked I-35 with depth charges five times. After Meade made the fifth attack, I-35, which had suffered heavy damage and was leaking in a number of places, was forced to surface and engage the destroyers with gunfire. Both destroyers opened fire on her with and 40-millimeter guns. At 17:51, Frazier rammed I-35 on her port quarter aft of her conning tower, badly damaging her own bow but rupturing I-35‚Ä≤s pressure hull. After Frazier backed away, I-35 sank by the stern at with the loss of 92 members of her crew. The destroyers launched boats, which found four survivors of I-35 in the water. One of them opened fire on an approaching boat crew, which returned fire and killed him, but the boats rescued the other three. The three survivors said that they believed that I-35 had been in combat with two cruisers, that the cruisers had launched two floatplanes, and that the floatplanes had bombed the submarine, with one bomb striking the ammunition box for her deck gun. On 10 January 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy ‚Äî unaware that the destroyers had rescued three survivors ‚Äî declared I-35 to be presumed lost with all hands in the Gilbert Islands area. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 April 1944. NotesSources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander. IJN Submarine I-35: Tabular Record of Movement. Retrieved on August 26, 2020.

Vlastos and his collaborators were betrayed to the Venetian authorities, who swiftly arrested and executed them in 1454. A smaller, follow-on plan for an intended uprising against Venice was dismantled in 1462. Background=Crete under Venice Venetian map of Crete. Crete had been under Venetian rule since 1211, having been sold to Venice by Boniface of Montferrat at the time of the Fourth Crusade. Owing to its central location along the trade routes, its size and its products, Crete had a strategic importance for the Venetian rule in the Eastern Mediterranean. Occupied Crete was divided into fiefs and a colony known as the Kingdom of Candia () had been established, having as capital the city of Candia (present- day Heraklion). The land was distributed to Venetian colonists (both nobles and citizens) on the condition that they paid taxes, manned Venetian warships and defended the possession in the name of Venice. Crete was governed by a Venetian noble elected by the Great Council of Venice, who bore the title of Duke of Candia and was assisted by two Councillors. Large cities were governed by Rectors who served under the Duke. Venetians ruled Crete primarily for their own interest, driving Cretans to forced labour or conscripting them for the wars of the Republic. During the five centuries of Venetian rule, Crete saw many rebellions by the native Cretan population against Venice. Unification of the Catholic and Orthodox churches Depiction of the council of Florence. In the early fifteenth century, the Byzantine Empire was on the verge of collapse due to the expansion of the Ottoman Turkish empire. Hoping to receive military assistance from the West, the Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaiologos was eager to form an alliance with the Latin Church. Hence, he arranged with Pope Eugene IV to hold discussions about reunion at the Council of Ferrara-Florence. After long negotiations and political pressure by the Byzantine Emperor, all Eastern bishopric representatives except Mark of Ephesus accepted Western doctrines such as Papal supremacy, Filioque and Purgatory, and in July 1439 signed a proclamation declaring the reunification of Latin and Eastern churches. However, upon returning to their home cities, Eastern bishops found that their agreement with the West was rejected by the populace and the vast majority of the low clergy. As a result, the union signed at Florence never came into effect. After the Fall of Constantinople two decades later, reunification became impossible as the Ottomans encouraged anti-unionists, aiming to keep Christianity divided. Venetian Crete in the first half of the 15th century Eastern Mediterranean c. 1450. After the short-lived Commune of Crete which resulted from the failed revolt of Saint Titus in 1363 and the suppression of the subsequent Callergis rebellion in 1368, Crete enjoyed a fairly long period of peace. Although Venice allowed Orthodox Cretans to freely practice their faith according to the Byzantine Rite, she refused to accept the dependence of the Cretan Orthodox clergy to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. This was because Venice perceived the Orthodox faith of Cretans as an obstacle to her rule, hence wished to prevent any political intervention by the Byzantine ecclesiastical hierarchy. Instead, Latin bishops and the protopapades, officials loyal to the state were appointed to administer religious affairs in Crete. Absence of higher Orthodox clergy in Crete meant that Orthodox who wished to be ordained had to leave the island for Peloponnese or the Ionian Islands. To boost morale and strengthen faith, Orthodox bishops and exarchs arrived in Crete during the second half of the fourteenth and the first decades of the fifteenth century. These included figures such as the Archbishop of Athens Anthimos the Confessor and the monk Joseph Bryennios, who joined forces with local anti-unionist theologians such as and . On the other hand, Pope Eugene IV sent to Crete archbishop Fantino Valaresso as his plenipotentiary, tasked with introducing the reforms needed to implement the union of the churches. Ecumenical Patriarchs such as Metrophanes II and his successor Gregory III encouraged the union and did not object to the Western involvement in Cretan ecclesiastical affairs, having accepted it as the price for the desperately needed help in confronting the Ottomans. In this setting, and from 1439 onwards, the religious policy of the Venetians aligned with that of the Holy See and sought to impose on Crete the terms of the Council of Ferrara-Florence. However, this was not welcome by the Cretans and increased the resentment of Venetian administration among them. Vlastos conspiracy In the summer of 1454, soon after the fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, Venetian authorities were informed that a rebellion against the Republic was being prepared. Their informants were Ioannis Lima, a Cretan priest, and the Venetian Andrea Nigro, who pointed out Sifis Vlastos () as leader of the conspiracy. In search of support, the conspirators had approached Lima, who instead of helping them, informed the Venetian officials. Sifis Vlastos (also Siphius or Sifi Vlasto) was a descendant of the Cretan noble Vlastos family, who resided in Rethymno. No further details are known about his life, however, it is conjectured that having conceived such a bold feat and having managed to gather a substantial number of followers, he must have been an important and influential person. The objective of the conspiracy was most probably a reaction against the oppression of the Venetian rulers and the encroachment of the Catholic Church. It has also been suggested by modern historians that a more ambitious aim was to establish an independent Greek state, which would continue the legacy of the Byzantine Empire. This is further supported by the account of Andrea Cornaro, according to whom the conspirators aimed to cut the Venetian rulers in pieces and install another ruler. Furthermore, Venetian documents found by mention that the conspirators had forged a letter of support from the Byzantine emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. Fearing that if Vlastos and his followers managed to ignite a rebellion, the military forces on Crete would be grossly outnumbered by the Cretans, the Venetian authorities under the Duke of Candia, Benedetto Vitturi, decided to act fast, without first consulting Doge Francesco Foscari. Thus, with the help of local feudatories, a total of 39 accomplices were arrested, among whom were the priests Manassis Arkoleon and Pavlos Kalyvas, and the civilians Leontakios Troulinos and Georgios Kallergis. The conspirators were executed by hanging, and their properties confiscated. Informants were given awards and hereditary annual subsidies that amounted to 1000 hyperpyra for each. They were also granted the right to be escorted by armed guards. Limas was offered the position of protopapas of Candia, but never occupied it in the fear of popular reaction. Offering material rewards in exchange of loyal services to Venice was a common practice of the Republic. As a further punishment, the Council of Ten forbade the ordination of Orthodox priests for five years and ordered the strengthening of the garrisons of Chania and Rethymno. The 1460‚Äì1462 conspiracy Following the fall of Constantinople and the decline of the Despotate of the Morea, Orthodox priests and monks fled to Crete, strengthening the anti-unionist sentiment there. Religious tensions continued, as unionists such as the Latin Patriarch Isidore of Kiev had also arrived on the island. In early February 1460, proclamations against Venetian rule were thrown outside the home of the Cretan noble Ioannis Melissinos. Melissinos send them to the Rector of Rethymno, and in reprisal was killed in his sleep the following night. The Rector offered a reward of 1000 (later raised to 3000) hyperpyra for the capture of those involved. In February 1461, the protopapas of Rethymno, Petros Tsagaropoulos, was expelled from Crete by the Council of Ten. In October 1461, the Jewish merchant David Mavrogonatos indicated Ioannis Gavalas as responsible for the deed. Gavalas was interrogated and executed along with a few other Cretans in early 1462. It is known today that the same Ioannis Lima who betrayed Vlastos, independently also betrayed Gavalas, but did not dare to seek a reward, fearing reprisals by the Cretans. Later on, having also served as a spy on behalf of Venice in Constantinople, Mavrogonatos was granted tax exemptions and the right to appear publicly without wearing a Jewish badge. He also successfully negotiated certain rights for the entire Jewish community of Crete. Manousakas' research cleared up a long-standing misconception, first made by Andrea Cornaro and adopted by many contemporary historians, according to which Mavrogonatos was involved in the betrayal of Vlastos' conspiracy in 1454. As a precaution, the Venetians expelled all monks and priests who had come to Crete from the Ottoman-occupied Greek mainland. Aftermath Both conspiracies were quelled before inflicting any tangible harm to the interests of Venice. However, the authorities remained vigilant and enforced further the measures towards the reunification of churches. Promotion of the union by Venice worsened the existing religious tensions in the Cretan society, which in turn helped develop some elements of national consciousness among Cretans. Realizing the failure of her policies and urged to secure the support of locals in the defense of Crete against the Turks as the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian wars broke out, Venice adopted a more sympathetic attitude towards Orthodoxy after the first half of the sixteenth century.

History The first maypole was built in the early 16th century outside the church of St Mary le Strand, and is believed to have been around high. As was common at the time, it was a regular custom to cover the maypole with flowers each May and dance around it.Walter Thornbury, 'St Mary-le-Strand and the Maypole', in Old and New London: Volume 3 (London, 1878), pp. 84-88. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol3/pp84-88 [accessed 27 August 2020]. It was destroyed in April 1644 by the Puritans during the English Civil War, after the House of Lords and House of Commons banned maypoles, believing them to represent pagan ceremonies that were considered \\"ungodly\\". It was replaced by a high structure on 14 April 1661 following the Restoration, and is believed to have been constructed by the local farrier John Clarges whose daughter had married George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle when he was a military general. The new maypole was the most celebrated of its kind in London throughout the late 17th century. It was damaged by wind a few years later, and subsequently restored. The maypole gradually decayed and was replaced in 1713; the current church was built in its location. In 1717, Sir Isaac Newton bought the maypole and transported it to Sir Richard Child's Wanstead House, now Wanstead Park. It was used to support Newton's telescope, which at that time was the largest in the world. Maypole Alley ran north from the maypole's location on the Strand. It was renamed Newcastle Street in the early 18th century after John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, and subsequently demolished during construction of Aldwych in 1905.

Reisinger received his country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for actions taken on July 1, 1863 during the Battle of Gettysburg. Early life Reisinger was born in Fallston, Pennsylvania in 1842 to Charles and Providence Reisinger. At age 2, the family moved to Venango County, Pennsylvania, and worked as farmers, lumberers, and blacksmiths. After six years, the family moved yet again, to Meadville, Pennsylvania where Roe attended school for three years, attending the Meadville Academy. Civil War service At the onset of the Civil War, Reisinger enlisted with the 150th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment and was assigned to Company H. His first conflict was at the Battle of Gettysburg where he served as one of the color corporals for his regiment. At around 2 o'clock, Reisinger was wounded by a musket shot to the ball of the right foot and had to proceed on crutches. Told to fall to the back of the unit, he refused, and marched forward on his heel. The 150th engaged a large Confederate advance near the McPherson house, and here Reisinger was shot a second time, in the right leg. As he fell back he was shot for a third time, in the right hip. Reisinger was held in a hospital for nearly a year, with the final musket ball extracted in May, 1864. For his valor during the fight, Reisinger was awarded the Medal of Honor on January 25, 1907.

Production The design was initially built in 1963 by Hinterhoeller Yachts in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada and also by Clarkecraft of St Catharines, Ontario. When Hinterhoeller Yachts was absorbed into C&C; Yachts in 1969, the Cygnus 20 tooling was sold to Skene Boats of Gloucester, Ontario. Skene Boats went out of business in 1992 and the design went out of production. The centreboard boat was originally sold under the name HR 20, but after a class association was formed in 1965-66 the design was renamed the Cygnus 20. It was produced in both centreboard and fixed keel versions from 1965. Design The Cygnus 20 is a recreational centreboard boat, or optionally a keelboat, built predominantly of fibreglass, with teak wooden trim above decks and mahogany below decks. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars, a spooned raked stem, a vertical transom, a transom- hung wooden rudder controlled by a tiller and a centreboard or fixed fin keel.

The purposes of green grabbing are varied; it can be done for ecotourism, conservation of biodiversity or ecosystem services, for carbon emission trading, or for biofuel production. It involves governments, NGOs, and corporations, often working in alliances. Green grabs can result in local residents' displacement from land where they live or make their livelihoods. Definition and purpose \\"Green grabbing\\" was first coined in 2008 by journalist John Vidal, in a piece that appeared in The Guardian called \\"The great green land grab\\". Social anthropologist Melissa Leach notes that it \\"builds on well-known histories of colonial and neo-colonial resource alienation in the name of the environment\\". Green grabbing is a more specific form of land grabbing, in which the motive of the land grab is for environmental reasons. Green grabbing can be done for conservation of biodiversity or ecosystem services, carbon emission trading, or for ecotourism. Conservation groups might encourage members of the public to donate money to \\"adopt\\" an acre of land, which goes towards land acquisition. Companies who engage in carbon emission trading might employ a green grab to plant trees--the resulting carbon offset can then be sold or traded. One program, Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), compensates companies and countries for conserving forests, though the definition of forest also includes forest plantations consisting of a single tree species (monoculture). Green grabbing can also be done for the production of biofuels. Biofuel production efforts, led by the US and European Union, have been a main driver of land grabbing in general. The International Land Coalition states that 59% of land grabs between 2000 and 2010 were because of biofuels. Occurrence Indebted governments may be especially vulnerable to green grabs, as they may agree to privatize and sell public assets to avoid bankruptcy. Green grabs involve large tracts of land consisting of thousands or millions of hectares. Green grabs have occurred in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Actors Modern green grabs are often enacted through alliances between national elites, government agencies, and private actors. Examples can include international environmental policy institutions, multi- national corporations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These varied actors align to achieve common goals; for example, ecotourism initiatives can result in the alignment of tourism companies, conservation groups, and governments. Conservation groups can also align with military or paramilitary groups to accomplish shared aims. Actors can also include entrepreneurs trying to profit from eco-capitalism, such as companies developing forest carbon offset projects, biochar companies, and pharmaceutical businesses. Implications Green grabbing can result in the expulsion of indigenous or peasant communities from the land they live on. In other cases, the use, authority, and management of the resources is restructured, potentially alienating local residents. Evictions due to palm oil biofuel has resulted in the displacement of millions of people in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, and India. The practice has been criticized in Brazil, where the government referred to one land acquisition NGO as \\"eco-colonialist\\". A shaman of the Yanomami tribe published a statement through Survival International saying, \\"Now you want to buy pieces of rainforest, or to plant biofuels. These are useless. The forest cannot be bought; it is our life and we have always protected it. Without the forest, there is only sickness.\\" The head of the Forest Peoples Programme Simon Colchester said, \\"Conservation has immeasurably worsened the lives of indigenous peoples throughout Africa,\\" noting that it resulted in forced expulsion, loss of livelihoods, and violation of human rights.

History During the Roman Eboracum period, the area in which Skeldergate runs lay within the civilian settlement. Trade took place throughout the area, and also in the Viking Jorvik period. The street's name is of Viking origin, and is often supposed to have derived from shield-makers in the area, but the Inventory of the Historical Monuments in City of York argues that there is no evidence for this industry in the area, and that such a niche trade would be unlikely to have given its name to an important city street. Instead, its name might derive from \\"skelde\\", meaning a shelf, and referring to the location of the street between the River Ouse and the then-terraced slope up to Bishophill, or alternatively, from the Viking name \\"Skjoldr\\". The street was first recorded in the 12th-century, and by 1282, the land along the street was divided into 68 plots, or \\"tofts\\". This made it the second-most important street on the south bank of the Ouse, after Micklegate. The land between the street and the river became the main area for dockside activity in the city, various wharves, and a crane, along with an assortment of warehouses. In 1660, the Queen's Staith was built parallel to the street, running up to Ouse Bridge. The landward side became dominated by large houses, belonging to wealthy merchants. In 1765, the architect John Carr built himself a house on the street. In the 12th-century, the new York city walls were completed. The southern end of the street ran through the Skeldergate Postern gate, and a ferry operated across the Ouse at this point. The gate was demolished in 1808, and the wall between the gate and the river in 1878, to allow the construction of the Skeldergate Bridge, which now forms part of the city's inner ring road. The decline of trade on the river in the 20th-century led to the demolition of many of the warehouses, including the 17th-century Dutch warehouse, along with several other notable buildings, such as the Plumbers Arms, dating from 1575, and John Carr's house. These demolitions continued until the 1980s, since when, many of the surviving warehouses have been converted into apartments, and the street is now primarily residential. The street is prone to flooding, and as a result, the ground floors of many buildings on the river side are given over to car parking. Architecture and layout Skeldergate House The street runs south- east from the junction of Micklegate, North Street and Bridge Street, to meet Bishopgate Road near Skeldergate Bridge. Fetter Lane, Buckingham Street, Albion Street, and Cromwell Road all lead off the south-western side, while only Queen's Staith and Terry Avenue lead off the north-eastern side. Despite the demolitions, several notable buildings remain on the street. On the south- west side, there are two buildings from the former Emperor's Wharf sawmill, Skeldergate House, which dates from 1777, the Ann Middleton Hospital, originally dating from 1659, and the 19th-century Terry Memorial Homes. Buildings on the north-east side include the modern Albion Wharf and City Mills blocks, both praised in Pevsner, and the late 19th-century Bonding Warehouse.

It was recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Helen Reddy, appearing on her album Helen Reddy, released in November 1971. The single peaked at number 62 in January 1972 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, staying on the chart for eight weeks. \\"No Sad Song\\" showed up on the Easy Listening (Adult Contemporary) chart for 4 weeks, rising to number 32. It also reached number 51 on the pop chart in Canada's RPM magazine. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau described \\"No Sad Song\\" as a minor hit for Reddy, and a missed chance for King to have a \\"tougher\\" song on one of her own albums. First appeared in November 1972 in Newsday. Stern's lyrics for \\"No Sad Song\\" describe the history and the death of a ladies' man, \\"stabbed in his bed\\" where he had brought so many women. The New Yorker called the song \\"Brecht-and-Weillian\\", referring to Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, famous for the murder-minded song \\"Mack the Knife\\". \\"No Sad Song\\" was called a \\"ballad about the unlamented murder of a rake.\\" \\"No Sad Song\\" was released in North America on 7-inch, 45 rpm vinyl with Reddy's own \\"More than You Could Take\\" on the B-side. In early 1972, several European printings of the single were released. Reddy recorded a French-language version of \\"No Sad Song\\" translated to \\"\\", making it available in both languages in France. French singer Sheila recorded this French version as \\"\\" (making it plural \\"Songs\\") for her 1972 album Poup√©e de Porcelaine (Porcelain Doll). Pierre Delano√´ wrote the French lyrics about a \\"suburban Don Juan\\". The song is 1 of 2 low-performing singles that Reddy put out in 1971, the other being her version of \\"Crazy Love\\" by Van Morrison, which rose to number 51 in September 1971. Reddy's first big success was \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\" which hit number 12 in June 1971, so the next 2 singles were considered disappointments. It was not until 1972's \\"I Am Woman\\" that Reddy hit the top of the charts, the song appearing in frustrating fits in June and September charts then finally breaking through to number 1 in December. Reddy said later to Ms. magazine's Susan Lydon that \\"No Sad Song\\" was too antagonistic: \\"it never took off because it put down men too much.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Helen Reddy performs on television in 1972 *Helen Reddy ‚Äì No Sad Song Lyrics on Genius Category:1971 singles Category:1971 songs Category:1972 songs Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Helen Reddy songs Category:Murder ballads Category:Sheila (singer) songs Category:Songs written by Carole King Category:Songs written by Toni Stern ","title":"No Sad Song"},{"id":"65103550","text":"390px Roman Charity is a c.1612 oil on canvas painting by Peter Paul Rubens, now in the Hermitage Museum, for which it was bought from Koblenz's collection in Brussels in 1768.

Emigration The Massachusetts Bay Colony had been founded by the owners of the Massachusetts Bay Company, which included investors in the failed Dorchester Company which had established a short-lived settlement on Cape Ann in 1623. The colony began in 1628 and was the company's second attempt at colonization. It was successful, with about 20,000 people migrating to New England in the 1630s. Atherton was part of this first wave of Puritan migration to New England (1620‚Äì1640). Atherton was a child emigrant. Biographers agree that he travelled from Lancashire to Bristol and then sailed on the James, in the company of the Reverend Richard Mather; a minister from his home town and Humphrey Atherton, an elder relative (but not a sibling). On June 4, 1635, he set sail for the New World aboard the ship James. However quotating another source, it sailed days earlier; As the ship James approached New England, a hurricane struck and it was forced to ride it out just off the coast of modern-day Hampton, New Hampshire. According to the ship's log and the journal of Increase Mather, the following was recorded; Atherton arrived in Boston on August 17, 1635, after weathering the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635. Arrival in Massachusetts Bay Colony He and his elder kinsman Humphrey Atherton, resided in Dorchester. He worked as a tanner and once he met the required age he went on to serve in the local militia within Captain John Whiting's Company. Move to Lancaster Atherton having become of age in Dorchester, was one of the earliest settlers of Lancaster, Massachusetts, accompanying John Prescott, who had obtained rights to settle in an area then known as Nashaway Plantation. Atherton's lot was situated on Neck Road. The precise time of early settlers arriving in Lancaster is not known. Initial lots of land had been allocated to Richard Linton, Lawrence Waters and John Ball, prior to the arrival c.1643 of Atherton and his peers; the Prescott's and the Sawyer's. Over the next seven years very little was done to advance the settlement of the Nashaway plantation. Atherton went on to become one of the founders of Lancaster at the time of its incorporation. He is listed as an official planter as of January 1653. Once more than nine families had settled, the planters petitioned the general court to be incorporated as a town, which was subsequently granted on May 18, 1653. The settlement was named Lancaster. It was likely chosen because of the ancestral connection Atherton shared with his neighbors, the Prescott's and Houghton's. The first town meeting on record was held in the summer of 1654, once the petition was granted. At the next meeting it was voted not to take into the town above thirty-five families, and the names of the following 22 townsmen that approved this, were: Edward Breek, Mr. Joseph Rowlandson (minister), John Prescott, William Kerley, Ralph Houghton, Thomas Sawyer, John Whitcomb, John Whitcomb, jr., Richard Linton, John Johnson, John Moore, William Lewis, John Lewis, Thomas James, Edmund Parker, James Atherton, Henry Kerley, Richard Smith, William Kerley, jr., John Smith, Lawrence Waters and John White In 1659 the town of Lancaster revoked the order limiting the settlers to 35, which followed a rapid increase in the population. Lancaster Raid It is unknown when Atherton left Lancaster for Milton, which at the time was part of Dorchester. Lancaster was still an isolated village on February 10, 1676, when a force of 1,500 Wampanoag, Nipmuc, and Narragansett Indians carried out a dawn attack, in what would become known as the Lancaster raid. Fortified garrison houses were set on fire, including the home of Rev. Joseph Rowlandson and 30 people killed. Most houses were destroyed and Mary Rowlandson and some of her children were taken hostage. This resulted in the abandonment of the settlement by most of the inhabitants who left by way of carts sent by the General Court during March 1676. Personal He married Hannah Hudson (1628-1713) in Lancaster c.1653. They had eight children: James, Hannah, Joshua, Hannah (2nd), Mary, Elizabeth, Deborah and Joseph. His youngest son Joseph, served in Sir William Phips‚Äô unsuccessful expedition against the French in Quebec. In 1690 he was a member of Captain John Withington's Company of Dorchester, along with his neighbor, Benjamin Willard, as part of a 2000 strong militia. After a victory in the Battle of Port Royal during May 1690, they departed Boston in August for Quebec. Joseph died during, or in the aftermath of Battle of Quebec. According to some sources he chose to convey his lands in Lancaster to his eldest son, James (a weaver) in 1698. However, in 1704, both he and his two surviving sons, James and Joshua were ordered to strengthen their garrisons in Lancaster. Ancestry He was related to Major General Humphrey Atherton, who up until his death in 1661 was the most powerful military leader in the colony. It was Humphrey's father who owned land in the parish of Wigan. Humphrey sat on the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was instrumental in getting the settlement of Lancaster incorporated as a town in 1652.

The original nucleus of the band comprised composers Shawn Brice (Wiz Art, Spawn) and Christian Petke (Count Zero). The band released four studio albums on COP International: Reality Check (1993), Zarathoustra (1995), Arashi Syndrom (1997), Cybrid (2001). History Deathline International was formed in 1991 out of Oakland, California, by composers Shawn Brice and Christian Petke. The band made their debut with 1993's Reality Check, released by COP International. The album was a fusion of orchestral samples with electro and heavy metal. The EP Venus Mind Trap was released in April 1995 and produced with the musical imput of John Carson of Grotus, Rey Osburn of Tinfed, Suzanne Santos of Hydro Chi Non and Evan Sornstein of Battery. They followed that release in November with the band's second album Zarathoustra. Their second album was produced with the collaborative efforts of most of the COP Intl. roaster. The band provided a cover of Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\", originally written for and performed by Gloria Jones, to COP Intl.'s Chaos Compilation in 1994. The band's third album Arashi Syndrom and second EP Wild Boys were released in 1997, with the former peaking at number twenty-one on CMJ's Dance Top 25. The album was commended for its synthesis of their brand of coldwave industrial music with new wave while showcasing the band's expanded compositional diversity. Founding member Shawn Brice departed from the band to pursue his own musical interests after deciding that Arashi Syndrome would be his final album writing credit with Deathline International. Keyboardist G.W. Childs joined the band, and in 2001 the band released their fourth album Cybrid. The band began releasing new material again on COP Intl. with the EP Eisb√§r in 2016. The following years saw the release of several more EPs, including Spin Zone, Breaking and Spin Zone II. In 2020 the band covered The Vibrators \\"Troops of Tomorrow\\", which they originally covered for 1997's Arashi Syndrom, with Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra and released it as a single on Bandcamp.

Career  Leitner studied at the University of Regensburg from 1982 to 1987 and received his doctorate in 1989 from the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry with a thesis on enantioselective catalytic transfer hydrogenation of formates. In 1990, he completed a postdoctoral stint in the working group of John Michael Brown at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory for Organic Chemistry at the University of Oxford. In 1991 and 1992 Leitner worked as a Liebig Fellow of the Fund of the Chemical Industry at the Inorganic- Chemical Institute of the University of Regensburg. After three years of work (1992-1995) at the CO2 Chemistry Working Group of the Max Planck Society (head: E. Dinjus) at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, he habilitated in the field of Inorganic Chemistry and was appointed private lecturer. He moved to the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research in M√ºlheim as head of the working group in the field of organic synthesis, where he took over the technical management at the beginning of 1998. From 2002 he has been the Chair of Technical Chemistry and Petroleum Chemistry, as the successor to Wilhelm Keim at the RWTH Aachen University. From September 2007, Leitner established the catalysis center \\"CAT\\" together with Bayer Material Science AG (now called Covestro AG) and Bayer Technology Services at RWTH Aachen University, of which he has been scientific director ever since. From 2004 to 2016, he was the scientific editor and then the chair of the editorial board of the journal Green Chemistry, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. During his engagement with DECHEMA, Leitner was on the board of the newly founded specialist section \\"Advanced Fluids\\" in 2007 and on the first board of the German Society for Catalysis (GeCatS) in 2008. On 1 October 2017, Leitner was appointed Director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion (MPI CEC) where he was appointed scientific director of the \\"Molecular Catalysis\\" Department. Leitner will continue his chair at RWTH for an initial period of five years as part-time professorship.  Research areas  Leitner's scientific work focuses on the development of catalysts and catalyst technologies for sustainable chemical processes (Green Chemistry). The focus is on the development and understanding of the mode of action of molecular catalysts, including detailed experimental and computer chemical studies of the mechanisms and structural-effect relationships in organometallic catalysis. Particular attention is paid to new material conversions and the use of new raw materials for catalytic synthesis as well as to the use of modern reaction media (supercritical fluids, ionic liquids, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and others) for catalytic processes. Multiphase catalysis and catalyst immobilization as well as the development of reactional concepts for continuous processes in molecular catalysis are also important research interests. The use of carbon dioxide, both as a raw material at the interface between chemistry and energy, as well as a green solvent and transport medium for continuous chemical processes, accompanied his scientific career.  Selected awards  Leitner received the Gerhard Hess Prize of the German Research Foundation in 1977, the Carl Zerbe Prize of the DGMK in 1998, the Otto Roelen Medal of DECHEMA in 2001, the W√∂hler Prize for Sustainable Chemistry of the German Chemical Society (GDCh) in 2009, and together with J√ºrgen Klankermayer the European Sustainable Chemistry Award of the European Chemical Society in 2014.

Her work on the poetic voice is accompanied by a renewal of poetic imagery whereby the poetic images can be considered a kind of emergence, a meeting point between sensation and idea, or as Johan Faerber terms it, ‚Äúthe image-idea‚Äù in Diakritik speaking of je neige (entre les mots de villon). The question of the status of poetic imagery is also anchored in a reconsideration and a renewal of poetic ekphrasis. Gauthier's work is marked by a polyphonic lyricism ; her poetry is neither strictly objective nor entirely focused on the self, but is marked by a fragmented incarnation, a multi-layered chorus that marks a space of vigilance. If her work is lyric, it's a transubjective lyric, allowing for the creation of a considered gap between voices in je neige (entre les mots de villon) when they intertwine ‚Äúthree voices, maybe four, that of Fran√ßois Villon, his others‚Äù. = Prose and poetry = In Le Monde Didier Cahen characterizes Gauthier's work as that of ‚Äúmaterialized sound‚Äù where ‚Äúdifferent tempos fuse together in the same beat, electrifying the senses‚Äù. In general, Laure Gauthier's texts alternate between passages in prose, prose-poetry and verse. The poems emerge as a kind of blue note at moments when the text breathes and its structure emerges, becoming fluid or on the contrary suspending its role in response to an external threat. Gauthier's writing is marked by its sense of movement, its materiality and its kinetic force, the language, ‚Äúdeaf, pulses, surges, laughs, illuminates, revolts, and finally exists on its own and for its own sake.‚Äù = Poetry, archives, and the tabloid journalism = In Gauthier's poetic work, she constantly questions external systematic attacks from a late capitalist society on the private life of the individual and on their personal expression, their burial under an accumulation of objects, a complacence with violence, a taste for sensationalism, what she calls the ‚Äútabloidization‚Äù of language or its exoticism. Gauthier frequently draws on archives for inspiration in her work. For example, La cit√© dolente, is based on real events while kaspar de pierre was adapted from the biography of the famous orphan Kaspar Hauser. Her collection je neige (entre les mots de villon) establishes a dialogue between the personal biography of Fran√ßois Villon and his work, while maintaining critical distance with her material. These books adopt a complex position in relation to the archive, where the archives are at once ‚Äúsuspected of a desire for reanimation. As if they were themselves an affirmation (‚Ä¶) while the poem only allows for suggestion.‚Äù These narratives are grounded in archival documents; however, Laure Gauthier positions the poetic narrative slightly out of bounds of historical documentation‚Äù in order to allow the document to show itself and what surges beneath it, what is alive and bridles next to the established record.‚Äù  Poetry and music  From 2018 on Laure Gauthier began to explore the links between poetry and contemporary music for the online literary journal Remue.net working with S√©bastien Rongier. She works to break down the barriers between sound poetry and written poetry, thereby renewing the links between contemporary music and poetry.  Transdisciplinary work  Her poetic work on poetic voice and polyphony continues with collaborations with contemporary artists such as Fabien L√©vy, N√∫ria Gim√©nez-Comas, and Xu Yi. Laure Gauthier is constantly seeking new poetic forms that cross media where the poet can be considered a co-author, ‚ÄúNun hab‚Äô ich nichts mehr‚Äù, for example is a piece for soporano coloratura, ensemble and synthesizer with music by Fabien L√©vy. ‚ÄúBack into Nothingness‚Äù is an mainly spoken monodrama for actress-soprano, choir and electronics with music by N√∫ria Gim√©nez-Comas. Les m√©tamorphoses du serpent blanc is a lyric tale in six songs with music by Xu Yi. In 2018 she collaborated with Pedro Garcia Velasquez and Augustin Mueller based on fragments of her texts and her recorded voice in order to create a 3D sound installation ‚ÄúEtudes de th√©√¢tre acoustique‚Äù, which was presented in the ZKM in Karlsruhe.

His father, a professional officer serving in Galicia, was a Croat, hence the atypical surname which often involved spelling problems (one of the Franiƒá family tombstones bears its surname ending with \\"ch\\"). Franiƒá mother, Anna von Victorin, descended from a family with Italian-Austrian roots which had lived in Poland for generations. She died two months after giving birth. Feliks, brought up by his father, grew up in Mak√≥w Podhala≈Ñski. He studied painting with Jan Matejko, and then with Wojciech Kossak. His works enjoyed considerable interest in the Krak√≥w artistic milieu. In 1888 and 1892 he exhibited his paintings \\"After the Cavalry Fight\\", \\"Two Outposts\\" and \\"The Outpost\\" at the Krak√≥w Society of Friends of Fine Arts. He also took part in the Polish Legions' exhibition in 1916 and the Exhibition of the Independent in 1929. He painted primarily military-oriented works, battle scenes depicting Napoleonic campaigns, national uprisings, and Polish Legions. His favorite motif were horses, often alongside knights, hussars or soldiers of the Napoleonic era. He also painted landscapes. During his lifetime he never staged an individual exhibition, though his drawings and paintings were published on postcards.

Its name came from the Tanacetum vulgare plant. The simplest version of the recipe was made by baking a batter flavored with green tansy juice. Later recipes, like the one from the 16th-century Good Housewife's Handbook added more ingredients like parsley, feverfew and violets to an egg batter that was fried like pancakes, though with a slightly green coloring from the addition of tansy and other herbs. Baked tansy could also be given a green color by adding spinach juice. An 18th-century recipe from The Compleat Housewife added sack to the batter and sweetened the fried tansies with gooseberries and a topping of crushed sugar. Cakes and wine were a common feature of Easter traditions. Some 19th-century authors believed that the tradition of eating tansy cakes, which had a sweet and bitter flavor, was connected to Jewish traditions of eating cakes made with bitter herbs. Sometimes the tansy was closer to a pudding than a pancake, like Hannah Glasse's 18th-century recipe in the Art of Cookery, an elaborate dish with Naples biscuits, butter, cream, blanched almonds, eggs, grated bread, rose water, orange blossom water and other spices and sweeteners.

He was a citizen of the city state of Carthage, which was in what is now Tunisia. His date of birth and age at death are both unknown, as are his activities prior to his coming to prominence in 255 BC. Modern historians distinguish him from other Carthaginians named Hasdrubal by the cognomen \\"son of Hanno\\". Hasdrubal was one of three Carthaginian generals, possibly the senior, who took command of the army raised when the Romans invaded North Africa in 255 BC. He was responsible for the decision to march against the Romans late in the year and was present at the Battle of Adys where the Carthaginians were routed. Early in 254 BC the triumvirate of Carthaginian generals gave control of the army to the Spartan mercenary commander, Xanthippus and accompanied him when the Romans were decisively beaten at the Battle of Tunis. The focus of the war moved to the island of Sicily where Hasdrubal took command of the Carthaginian army. The Romans avoided battle between 254 and 251 BC because they feared the war elephants which had accompanied Hasdrubal. In late summer 250 BC Hasdrubal led out his army, the Romans withdrew to Panormus and Hasdrubal pressed on to the city walls. Once he arrived at Panormus, the Romans turned to fight, countering the elephants with a hail of javelins. Under this missile fire the elephants panicked and fled through the Carthaginian infantry. The Roman heavy infantry then charged and the Carthaginian army broke. As was the Carthaginian custom after a defeat, Hasdrubal was recalled to Carthage to be executed.  Name Hasdrubal was a citizen of the city state of Carthage; he is distinguished by modern historians from other Carthaginians named Hasdrubal by the cognomen \\"son of Hanno\\". Hasdrubal's date of birth and age at death are both unknown, as are his activities prior to his coming to prominence in 256 BC during the First Punic War. Only four set piece land battles took place during the 23 years of the war; Hasdrubal took part as a general in three of them. Background The city of Carthage was in what is now Tunisia (close to what is now Tunis) and by the mid-3rd century BC it had come to dominate southern Spain, much of the coastal regions of North Africa, the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, and the western half of Sicily in a military and commercial empire. Carthage was the leading maritime power in the Western Mediterranean with its navy dominating both militarily and commercially, while Rome had recently unified mainland Italy south of the Arno. The First Punic War broke out between Carthage and Rome in 264 BC and by 260 BC the war had grown into a struggle in which the Romans wanted to at least control the whole of Sicily. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. The Romans were essentially a land-based power and had gained control of much of Sicily using their army. The war there had reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced by sea without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere. The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; in 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet using a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own ships. Invasion of Africa Naval victories at Mylae in 260BC and Sulci in 258BC, and their frustration at the continuing stalemate in Sicily, led the Romans to focus on a sea-based strategy and to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten its capital, Carthage. Both sides were determined to establish naval supremacy and invested large amounts of money and manpower in increasing and maintaining the size of their navies.  Battle of Ecnomus The Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transport ships sailed from Ostia, the port of Rome, in early 256 BC, commanded by the consuls for the year, Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus. They embarked approximately 26,000 picked legionaries from the Roman forces on Sicily. The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans' intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, under Hanno and Hamilcar, off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them. The combined total of about 680 warships carrying up to 290,000 crew and marines met in the Battle of Cape Ecnomus. The Carthaginians took the initiative, anticipating that their superior ship- handling skills would tell. After a prolonged and confused day of fighting the Carthaginians were defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk.  Battle of Adys  As a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Regulus, landed in Africa near Aspis (modern Kelibia) on the Cape Bon Peninsula in the summer of 256 BC and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside. They captured 20,000 slaves, \\"vast herds of cattle\\", and after a brief siege, captured the city of Aspis. They also formented rebellions in many of Carthage's subject territories. The Roman Senate sent orders for most of the Roman ships and a large part of the army to return to Sicily, probably due to the logistical difficulties of feeding these more than 100,000 men over the winter. Regulus was left with 40 ships, 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to overwinter in Africa. His orders were to weaken the Carthaginian army pending reinforcement in the spring. It was expected he would achieve this by raids and by encouraging Carthage's rebellious subject territories, but consuls had wide discretion. This is the point at which Hasdrubal first appears in the historical record. The Carthaginian senate appointed him as a general, jointly with Bostar, to counter this threat. They took command of an army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and were joined by a third general, Hamilcar, the Carthaginian commander on Sicily, who was recalled along with 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. The total size and the makeup of the army is not known, but it was reported to be approximately the same size as the Roman army and a few months later, at the Battle of Tunis, the Carthaginians fielded 100 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry; the latter would have included many citizen-militia. Hasdrubal may have been the senior of the three Carthaginian generals as he is reported to have made the decision to march their army out to oppose Regulus. Regulus chose to take his relatively small force and strike inland. He advanced on the city of Adys (modern Uthina), only south-east of Carthage, and besieged it. Determined to prevent the Romans further despoiling the countryside, the Carthaginian generals advanced their army to Adys, where it set up a fortified camp on a rocky hill near the town. They did not wish to commit to a battle on the open ground around Adys too hastily. Polybius is critical of this decision by the Carthaginians, as their main advantages over the Romans were their cavalry and their elephants, neither of which could be deployed to advantage from behind fortifications, on steep ground, or in rough terrain. Modern historians point out that the Carthaginian generals would have been well aware of the strength of the legions when formed up in open battle and that to pause in a strong position while scouting the enemy and formulating a plan was not obviously a mistake. This was especially the case as their army was newly formed and not yet fully trained or used to operating together; although the modern historian George Tipps describes this deployment as a \\"total misuse\\" of their cavalry and elephants. With the Carthaginian army overlooking him from a fortified hill Regulus immediately made the audacious decision to split his army in two and have each carry out a night march to launch a surprise dawn attack on the camp. The Romans would be attacking uphill against the Carthaginians' prepared position, but an attack from two directions would be difficult to respond to. Tipps describes the plan as a demonstration of Regulus's \\"recklessness\\". Both Roman forces were in position on time and successfully launched their attacks, although apparently not simultaneously. Complete surprise cannot have been achieved, as at least a large part of the Carthaginians were able to form up and confront one half of the Roman assault. This column was thrown back by the Carthaginiansit is assumed at the line of their fortifications, although this is not certainand driven down the hill in disorder. The situation was confused, with the rest of the Carthaginians taking no effective action and failing to co-ordinate with their victorious colleagues. According to the military historian Nigel Bagnall, the cavalry and elephants were promptly evacuated, as it was recognised they would not be able to play any useful role, either in defending the fortifications or on the broken terrain of the hill more generally. Those Carthaginians pursuing the first Roman force chased them off the hill, and all or part of the second Roman column, rather than attacking the Carthaginian camp, charged downhill into the rear of the now over-extended Carthaginians. It is possible this group of Carthaginians also faced a frontal counter-attack by Roman reserves after leaving the hill. In any event, after some further fighting they fled the field. At this the Carthaginians in the camp, the fortifications of which had not been breached, panicked and withdrew. The Romans pursued for some distance, although the primary sources provide no figures for Carthaginian losses. Modern historians suggest the early Carthaginian order to evacuate their cavalry and elephants meant that they suffered few or no losses. Breaking off their pursuit, the victorious Romans plundered the hilltop camp.  Battle of Tunis  The Romans followed up and captured numerous towns, including Tunis, only from Carthage. From Tunis the Romans raided and devastated the immediate area around Carthage. Many of Carthage's African possessions took the opportunity to rise in revolt. The city of Carthage was packed with refugees fleeing Regulus or the rebels, and food ran out. In despair the Carthaginians sued for peace. Regulus, within sight of what he took to be a thoroughly defeated Carthage, demanded harsh terms. Finding these unacceptable, the Carthaginians decided to fight on. The Carthaginians were recruiting fighting men from all over the Mediterranean region, and at around this time a large group of recruits from Greece arrived in Carthage. Among them was a Spartan mercenary commander, Xanthippus. Polybius notes that he had taken part in Spartan training methods and that he knew both how to deploy and how to manoeuvre an army. He made a good impression with the troops of the Carthaginian army, and was able to persuade the Carthaginian Senate that the strongest elements of their army were their cavalry and elephants and that to be deployed to best effect they needed to fight on open level ground. The historian John Lazenby speculates he may have previously faced elephants when Pyrrhus of Epirus attacked Sparta in the 270sBC. Xanthippus was put in charge of training both the new recruits and the existing army over the winter, although the committee of three Carthaginian generals retained operational control. As the prospect of a decisive battle drew nearer, and as Xanthippus's skill at manoeuvring the army became more evident, full control was given to him. Whether this was a decision of the generals, the Senate, or was forced on them by the wishes of the troops, who included many Carthaginian citizens, is not clear. Xanthippus, accompanied by the triumvirate of Carthaginian generals, led the army of 100 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantrythe latter included the 5,000 veterans from Sicily and many citizen-militiaout of Carthage and set up camp close to the Romans in an area of open plain. The precise site is not known, but it is assumed to be close to Tunis. The Roman army of about 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry advanced to meet them, and set up camp about away. The next morning both sides deployed for battle. Xanthippus placed the Carthaginian citizen-militia in the centre of his formation; with the Sicilian veterans and the freshly hired infantry divided on either side of them; and with the cavalry equally divided on either side of these. The elephants were deployed in a single line in front of the centre of the infantry. The Romans placed their legionary infantry in their centre, arranged in a deeper and denser formation than usual. Polybius considered this to be an effective anti- elephant formation, but points out that it shortened the frontage of the Roman infantry and made them liable to being out-flanked. Light infantry skirmishers were positioned in front of the legions, and the 500 cavalry were divided between the flanks. Regulus apparently hoped to punch through the elephants with his massed infantry, overcome the Carthaginian phalanx in their centre and so win the battle before he needed to worry about being attacked on the flanks. The battle opened with attacks by the Carthaginian cavalry and elephants. The Roman cavalry, hopelessly outnumbered, were soon swept away. The Roman legionaries advanced, shouting and banging their sword hilts on their shields in an attempt to deter the elephants. Part of the Roman left overlapped the line of elephants, and they charged the infantry of the Carthaginian right, who broke and fled back to their camp, pursued by the Romans. This part of the Roman force probably consisted of Latin allies. The rest of the Roman infantry had difficulties with the elephants, who were not deterred by their noise but charged home, inflicting casualties and considerable confusion. At least some of the legionaries fought their way through the line of elephants, and attacked the Carthaginian phalanx. But they were too disordered to fight effectively and the phalanx held firm. Some units of the Carthaginian cavalry were now returning from their pursuit and started to attack or feint against the Roman rear and flanks. The Romans attempted to fight on all sides which brought their forward momentum to a halt. The Romans held firm, possibly partly because of the way their dense formation jammed them close together, but the elephants continued to rampage through their ranks, and the Carthaginian cavalry pinned them in place by hurling missiles into their rear and flanks. Then Xanthippus ordered the phalanx to attack. Most of the Romans were packed into a space where they could not resist effectively and were slaughtered. Regulus and a small force fought their way out of the encirclement, but were pursued and shortly he and 500 survivors were forced to surrender. A total of about 13,000 Romans were killed. The Carthaginians lost 800 men from the force on their right which was routed; the losses of the rest of their army are not known. A force of 2,000 Romans survived, from the left wing who had broken through into the Carthaginian camp; they escaped the battlefield and retreated to Aspis. This was Carthage's only victory in a major land battle during the war. Xanthippus, fearful of the envy of Hasdrubal and the other Carthaginian generals he had outdone, took his pay and returned to Greece. Regulus died in Carthaginian captivity; later Roman authors invented a tale of him displaying heroic virtue while a prisoner. The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians attempted to oppose it. In the resulting Battle of Cape Hermaeum off Africa the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured and 16 sunk. The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, 384 ships were sunk from their total of 464 and 100,000 men lost,the majority non-Roman Latin allies.  Sicily  Having lost most of their fleet in the storm of 255 BC, the Romans rapidly rebuilt it, adding 220 new ships, and launched a determined offensive in Sicily; their entire fleet, under both consuls, attacked Panormus early in 254 BC. Panormus was a large- for-the-time city on the north coast of Sicily, the site of the modern Sicilian capital Palermo. It had a population of approximately 70,000 and was one of the largest Sicilian cities still loyal to Carthage and the most important economically. The city's prosperity was based on trade and fishing, which resulted in an unusual lack of agriculture and the area immediately around the city was thickly forested, even close to the gates. The city was surrounded and blockaded, and siege engines set up. These made a breach in the walls which the Romans stormed, capturing the outer town and giving no quarter. The inner town promptly surrendered. The 14,000 inhabitants who could afford it ransomed themselves and the remaining 13,000 were sold into slavery. Much of western inland Sicily then went over to the Romans: Ietas, Solous, Petra, and Tyndaris all came to terms. In response to these events on Sicily the Carthaginians despatched Hasdrubal to Sicily, probably in 254 BC, with the 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry they had earlier withdrawn and a reinforcement of 140 elephants. The Romans avoided battle between 254 and 251 BC; according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily. Bagnall suggests that survivors of the battle against Xanthippus passed on \\"horrific stories\\" of the effectiveness of the Carthaginian cavalry and elephants in open battle. In consequence the Carthaginians, probably with a smaller army than the Romans, dominated the plains; while the Romans stayed on higher and broken ground, where much of the effect of the cavalry and elephants would have been nullified. Both sides declined to face the other on their favoured terrain. Hasdrubal spent the time drilling and training his army, including the elephants. In 252 BC the Romans captured Thermae and Lipara, which had been isolated by the fall of Panormus.  Battle of Panormus  In late summer 250 BC Hasdrubal, hearing that one consul (Gaius Furius Pacilus) had left Sicily with half of the Roman army, marched out from the major Carthaginian stronghold of Lilybaeum towards Panormus with 30,000 men and between 60 and 142 elephants. Halting some distance away, he devastated the harvest in the territories of Rome's newly allied cities, in an attempt to provoke the Roman commander, Lucius Caecilius Metellus, into battle. The Roman troops amounted to two legions, and they had been dispersed to gather the harvest. Metellus withdrew them in front of the advancing Carthaginians and they retreated into Panormus. This timidity was what Hasdrubal had come to expect, and he advanced down the Oreto valley, continuing to despoil the countryside. The Oreto reached the sea immediately south of Panormus, and once there Hasdrubal ordered part of his army to cross the river and advance up to the city wall. Once the elephants had crossed, or were crossing, the river, Metellus sent his light infantry to skirmish with the Carthaginians and impede their passage. These light troops hurled javelins at the Carthaginians, and had been instructed to concentrate on their elephants. Panormus was a major supply depot, and townspeople were employed in carrying bundles of javelins from stocks within the city to the foot of the walls so the Roman skirmishers were constantly resupplied. The ground between the river and the city was covered with earthworks, some constructed during the Roman siege and some part of the city's defensive works, which provided cover for the Romans and made it difficult for the elephants to advance, or even manoeuvre. The elephants' mahouts, eager to demonstrate their charges' prowess to Hasdrubal, nevertheless drove them forward. Some accounts also have missiles being hurled down from the city walls at them. Peppered with missiles and unable to retaliate, the elephants panicked and fled through the Carthaginian infantry behind them. Denarius of C. Caecilius Metellus Caprarius (125 BC). The reverse alludes to the triumph of his ancestor Lucius Caecilius Metellus which featured the elephants he captured at Panormus. Metellus had concealed himself and a large part of his army either in the woods just outside the city gate, or immediately inside the gates; in either case this meant he was upstream from where the Carthaginian army was fording the river. From here Metellus fed fresh troops into the large-scale skirmish under the city walls. When the elephants broke, disorganising a large part of the Carthaginian army and demoralising all of it, Metellus ordered an attack on its left flank. The Carthaginians fled; those who attempted to fight were cut down. Hasdrubal escaped. Metellus did not permit a pursuit, but did capture ten elephants in the immediate aftermath and, according to some accounts, the rest of the surviving animals over the succeeding days. Contemporary accounts do not report the other losses of either side, although the Carthaginians' are thought to have been heavy. Modern historians consider later claims of 20,000‚Äì30,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable. Similarly, later accounts that the large Celtic contingent in the Carthaginian army were drunk when the battle began are usually dismissed; as is the suggestion that a Carthaginian fleet took part in the operation, causing heavy casualties when many fleeing soldiers ran into the sea hoping to be taken off by their ships. Panormus was the fourth and final set piece battle of the war. Death and afterwards As was the Carthaginian custom after a defeat, Hasdrubal was recalled to Carthage to be executed. After his success at Panormus, Metellus received a triumph in Rome on 7 September 250 BC, during which he paraded with the elephants he had captured at Panormus, who were then slaughtered in the Circus Maximus. The defeat, and especially the loss of the elephants, resulted in the Romans feeling freer to manoeuvre on the plains, and the Carthaginians no longer being willing to challenge them. Henceforth the Carthaginian approach was purely defensive. The war ended nine years later in 241 BC with a Roman victory.

Only one was built. Design and development At the start of the collaboration between Swen Swanson and Ole Fahlin, Swanson had already designed several aircraft and Fahlin was better known for propeller design. Lacking manufacturing space of their own, and as they had chosen to design a smaller, less powerful development of the Swanson Coupe light aircraft around a Pobjoy engine, the facilities of the U.S. Pobjoy distributors, Nicholas- Beazely, provided a natural space for its construction. The SF-1 was a high, cantilever, gull wing cabin aircraft of all-wood and canvas construction. The wing was mounted on the fuselage according to Swanson's patented design, which left the central section over the cabin clear, with a short, strut-supported, high dihedral part of the wing immediately outboard. In plan the wings were straight-tapered, with an unswept leading edge and rounded tips. Its air- cooled, seven cylinder, Pobjoy R radial engine was supplied with its own long- chord cowling which was merged smoothly into the forward fuselage. Gearing off-set the propeller drive shaft upwards. Behind, the SF-1's cabin for two, sitting side-by-side, was under the wing and was accessed via external steps and wide doors. At the rear the tail was conventional, with a near-triangular fin and deep, rounded rudder and a tailplane mounted near the top of the fuselage. The elevators had a cut-out for rudder movement. The SF-1's landing gear had independent legs with their struts enclosed in streamlined fairings and braced with streamlined tie-rods. Wheel track was . A pneumatic tailwheel was mounted at the extreme rear fuselage. Operational history The only SF-1 was first flown in 1934. Its subsequent history is uncertain, except that it was re-engined in about 1937 with a , flat-four Continental A-85.

Litchinitser is an Electrical Engineer and Professor at Duke University. She works on optical metamaterials and their application in photonic devices. Litchinitser is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, The Optical Society and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  Early life and education  Litchinitser was born in Russia. She earned her undergraduate degree in physics at the Moscow State University. She moved to the United States for her graduate studies and she joined the Illinois Institute of Technology. Her doctoral research considered Fiber Bragg grating filters for the compensation of dispersion. In 1997 Litchinitser joined the Institute of Optics in Rochester, New York, where she was made a postdoctoral research fellow. She joined Bell Labs at the same time that the field of metamaterials was emerging, and switched her focus on the theoretical properties of metamaterials that manipulate the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. In 2005 Litchinitser moved to the University of Michigan.  Research and career  In 2008 Litchinitser was made an Assistant Professor of Optics at the State University of New York, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011. She moved to Duke University in 2018. Her research focusses on metamaterials and topological photonics. Metamaterials are artificial structures that manipulate waves using a carefully controlled nanostructure as opposed to chemistry. She has used metamaterials to create a hyperlens; that is, a lens that escapes the diffraction limit by converting evanescent waves into propagating waves. To create the lens Litchinitser made use of gold and poly(methyl methacrylate) arranged in Slinky-like formation, which can overcome the diffraction limit to visible light. It is hoped that such lens could be used to improve the resolution of endscopes, allowing early detection of certain cancers. Litchinitser makes use of metamaterials to manipulate electric and magnetic fields, engineering shaped beams of light. These shaped beams (rather than the typical 'circular' beam, a beam that is shaped more like a vortex) of light allow access to otherwise forbidden higher-order spectroscopic transitions. Metamaterials offer the potential to tailor the orbital angular momentum and polarisation states of light. Circularly polarised light involves an electric field that rotates around the direction of propagation, such that the photons carry spin angular momentum. When spin-orbit interactions are controlled, spin angular momentum can be converted into orbital angular momentum. Orbital angular momentum (or vortex beams) can make symmetry-forbidden transitions possible, with a transition rate that increases when the size of the beam decreases. She has since shown that it is possible to measure a vortex laser's orbital angular momentum modes using a tunable micro-transceiver chip-based detector, offering hope that such systems could be used for fast data transmission. The detector makes use of a photodetector that is responsive to orbital angular momentum modes. Topological photonics looks to navigate light around tight corners using tiny waveguides that eliminate the scattering of light. To achieve this, Litchinitser designed crystal lattices with carefully controlled geometries, which allow light to travel perfectly across their surfaces but block it from travelling through the interior. The ability for light to travel around corners is essential for photonic-based microchips, which will be essential for future data transmission. Litchinitser delivered a plenary lecture at the 2018 SPIE Optics and Photonics conference, where she discussed the interaction of structured light and nanostructured media. At the 2020 SPIE Optics and Photonics conference Litchinitser chaired the session on Nanoscience and Engineering.
