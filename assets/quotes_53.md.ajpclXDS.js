The parish was founded and the church built in 1511 by Mikołaj II Radziwiłł, voivode of Vilnius. Its funding was increased by King Sigismund II Augustus. The church in Kalinówka was under the patronage of Saint Anne. A new church was built, perhaps around the middle of the 16th century, and the old one was transported to Brzozowa, which was a branch of the Kalinówka church. On 17 August 1761 the church in Kalinówka burned down, along with the archive and rectory. It was rebuilt anew of larch wood, thanks to the efforts of Rev. Adam Świerzbiński, pastor in Kalinówka, canon of Inflanty. The construction undoubtedly lasted several years and was finished in 1776. This church was consecrated on 5 October 1777 by Brześć (of Łuck diocese) suffragan bishop Jan Szyjkowski. This church has survived to modern times and continues to serve the faithful. At that same time, that is, around 1774, a new rectory was built as well as other pastoral buildings, including a storeroom that has survived to our day and is registered as a monument [or relic]. The rectory from that time, on the other hand, was taken apart after a new one was built of brick and stone, in the days of pastor Rev. Antoni Kruk in the 1980s.

Analogous to the Israeli IMI Mini-Uzi, the PM-9 has the same telescoping bolt as the Mini-Uzi, but differs in its appearance, operational use and handling. The JSDF uses the PM9 as its official submachine gun, although some of its special forces units now use other weapons. The 1st Airborne Brigade and the Western Army Infantry Regiment are the only special forces units in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) known to be armed with the PM-9 as the brigade's main submachine gun. The PM-9 is reported to be in use in the JGSDF's Special Forces Group. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) uses it when conducting base security. Although PM-9 nomenclature is widely used among non-Japanese firearms communities, there had been no known public records or confirmations of its official use. As such, the firearm is mostly referred to in its full name or in its shorthands, and less so in the supposed alphanumeric nomenclature in Japanese texts. History 1st Airborne Brigade paratroopers in a parade with PM-9s. The PM-9 is produced by the Nippon Miniature Bearing Company, otherwise known as Minebea. The design is analogous to the Mini-Uzi submachine gun. It was adopted in 1999 for non-frontline forces such as vehicle drivers, artillery personnel, some of its special forces units, and some commissioned officers who were given priority for better equipment. Though it has been the official submachine gun for more than a decade, JSDF officials are looking at a possible replacement, as it is planned to phase it out in the near future. One possible replacement is the Heckler & Koch MP5. JSDF troops assigned to guard duty on both Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and JASDF garrison bases had their PM-9s replaced with other high-performing submachine guns, and the JGSDF will also eventually replace the PM-9. Features The PM-9 differs in appearance from its Israeli counterpart in a few ways. A foregrip is mounted underneath the barrel of the PM-9 to aid fully automatic firing with a flash suppressor in place. The weapon can also be modified to have a foldable stock, a detachable suppressor and a mounted reflex sight, though these modifications are most unlikely to be used in peacekeeping operations abroad, since such activities do not involve Japanese soldiers in combat situations. The initial batches of PM-9s were first made with wooden pistol and foregrips, before they switched to use plastic grips on the current PM-9s in JSDF service. Adoption There were some questions as to why the PM-9 was only adopted for JSDF use a decade ago, though the following were said to be reasons: # Minebea was able to create a quality weapon, as it also made the SIG Sauer P220 (Minebea P-9) under license. # It was the only design that could be manufactured with Minebea's equipment. # At the time of selection and adoption, the Uzi was highly regarded as an adequate weapon. Although these reasons are quite valid, it was said that the reason why the PM-9 was adopted as the JSDF's main submachine gun is because of the high costs that would arise if they were to select the Heckler & Koch MP5 instead.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It is also listed on the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia and the former Register of the National Estate.  History  A natural site, Wingecarribee Swamp is a remnant of a late glacial swamp overlying the Triassic sandstone and Wianamatta Shale of the Southern Highlands. The wetlands' peat deposits provide a rare resource for scientific study but are also sought after as a mining resource. The Wingecarribee Swamp covers and is over 5000 years old. It is listed as an Endangered Ecological Community at both State and Federal levels and contains four threatened species: the plants Lysimachia vulgaris var. davurica (yellow loosestrife); Gentiana wingecarribiensis (Wingecarribee gentian) and Prasophyllum uroglossum (leek orchid) and one insect, Petalura gigantea (giant dragonfly). The adjacent Wingecarribee Reservoir plays a pivotal role in the water supply system as water from Tallowa Dam is pumped up to Wingecarribee Reservoir and then can be diverted to Warragamba Dam or Nepean Dam. The swamp has a history of disturbance with a portion being partly inundated with the construction of the Wingecarribee Reservoir in 1974. It was grazed for many years and had been burned frequently to provide green pick for cattle. It was also mined for peat. In August 1998 the swamp partially collapsed into the reservoir. The collapse cannot be attributed to any one factor but a high rainfall event coupled with instability, as a result of peat mining, and low reservoir levels at the time of the collapse, may have contributed. Spontaneous bog bursts have been documented from time to time in the Northern Hemisphere. Following the swamp's collapse, its geomorphology changed dramatically, the peat fractured and a major channel was formed on its northern side. The vegetation was highly disturbed and bare peat was exposed. Turbidity (cloudiness) in the adjoining reservoir was over 300 NTU. A few months later willows (Salix sp.) growing on the margin of the swamp seeded and there was an explosion of willow seedlings germinating in the nutrient-rich bare peat. The level of disturbance suffered by the swamp is too great to consider restoration as a feasible option for action, however management is focused on the values the swamp still retains. The swamp is now referred to by its post-collapse landform units: the intact, drying fissured channel and delta areas. The fissured areas have had a great deal of damage, while the delta - the mass of peat expelled into the reservoir - seems to be developing an ecological value in its own right. The delta area closest to the swamp is fairly stable, whereas the front rises and falls with the reservoir level but does not move laterally.Knowles, 2008, 2-3  Description  The swamp is in the Southern Highlands, backing on the Wingecarribee Reservoir (to its west) and forming the headwaters of the Wingecarribee River. Wingecarribee Swamp forms the main headwaters of the Wingecarribee River which is a tributary of the Wollondilly River. It exists now as a remnant of what was probably a larger late glacial swamp overlying the Permian sandstone and wianamatta shale, and now mostly removed by the combined rejuvenation of the Wollondilly, Nepean and lower Shoalhaven catchments resulting from the last uplift of the sandstone plateau. Only Wingecarribee Swamp has survived intact, by reason of an unusual combination of geomorphic phenomena: it is surrounded on the north, east and south by low basalt hills which protect it from capture by tributaries of the Nepean River and Shoalhaven River, leaving a small outlet to the west into the gently west-dipping Wollondilly catchment. The swamp contains a rich assemblage of water and bog plants. Perched water table and impeded drainage has resulted in the development of a deep acid peat swamp of late glacial age. The swamp is the largest peatland in montane Mainland Australia with an area of about , an average depth of fibrous and humic peat of around , and up to of peat in some areas. Peatlands of this kind are rare in Australia and have developed in isolation from each other and related ecosystems. The accumulation of peat in the swamp is very rapid with most of the peat being formed in the past 25,000 years with up to of very fresh peat preserved. This is a very rapid accumulation rate, especially for temperate Australia. Wingecarribee Swamp has a number of plant communities represented including Eucalyptus ovata open woodland, Poa australis closed tussock grassland, Leptospermum ovatum tall shrubland, Sphagnum christatum mossland, Carex gaudichaudiana closed sedgeland, Phragmites communis tall closed grassland, Eleocharis dulcis typha muelleri open sedgeland, Triglochin procerum-carex sp. aquatic sedgeland and Lepyrodia anarthria open rushland which is the dominant community. The lepyrodia community found here is the richest and most extensive of this type known. There is an extension of higher altitude taxa at this site and it might be inferred that the swamp has acted as a refuge for flora and possibly invertebrate fauna since the last cool period. One endangered plant species, Wingecarribee gentian, (Gentiana wingecarribiensis), is an endemic noted only from Wingecarribee Swamp. The nearest relative species is the alpine gentian. Botanical and palaeoenvironmental research has been carried out by several workers with studies continuing. The peat deposits act as repositories for information about ecosystem history and environmental change in the locality. Fossil wood more than 35,000 years old has been recovered from the north-western margin of the swamp indicating that the swamp may be of this age. Studies of carbonised particles from cores taken from the swamp have inferred a regime of fire events over the 150,000 years prior to European settlement. It is possible that Indigenous values of National Estate significance may exist in this area. As yet these have not been identified, documented or assessed. A reservoir floods the north west third of the swamp, which is not included in the listing. The dam does not detract from the ecological or palaeoecological values of the section of the swamp listed. Fibrous peat has been extracted from the swamp over twenty years from two mining leases with a total area of about so far effected removing the top of peat. This only affects a small area of the swamp. The whole of the swamp is affected by human disturbance. Longitudinal drains about deep run parallel to the water flow and remove some of the surface water allowing about sixty percent of the surface to be used as rough pasture. Evidence for burning of the swamp is seen as scorched shrubs and burnt fenceposts. Invasions by European weeds is at a remarkably low level except around the margins. Thus although the swamp has probably changed from its pre-European vegetational structure, it still preserves natural communities with the peatland still actively growing. The adjacent Wingecarribee Swamp covers and is over 5000 years old. It is listed as an Endangered Ecological Community at both State and Federal levels and contains four threatened species: the plants Lyscimachia vulgaris var. davurica (yellow loosestrife); Gentiana wingecarribiensis (Wingecarribee gentian) and Prasophyllum uroglossum (leek orchid) and one insect, Petalura gigantea (giant dragonfly).  Heritage listing  Wingecarribee Swamp is a remnant of a late glacial swamp. It is one of the oldest montane mires known in south-east Australia. Analyses of sediments dated from 15,000 BP (before the present) have provided valuable information about climatic and vegetation changes in Australia since the Pleistocene era. Wingecarribee Swamp was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Wingecarribee swamp provides a rare example of a peatland in south-east Australia. Peatlands are rare in this region and Wingecarribee because of its large size is classed as outstanding. The swamp is biogeographically significant. It has acted as a refugia for alpine flora and possibly invertebrate fauna since the last cool time approximately 10,000 years ago. An endangered species, gentiana wingecarribeinsis, is known only from this swamp. Its closest relative is the alpine gentian which now occurs only in the Alps. This swamp is the best example of a montane peatland at comparatively low altitude in Australia. It is also the northernmost significant peatland known in New South Wales. The dominant lepyrodia anarthria open rushland community is the richest and most extensive community of this type known in Australia. The swamp also provides an outstanding example of vegetation dynamics as well as providing some of the best known stands of the swamp vegetation types represented. Wingecarribee Swamp has the oldest basal date of any montane mire known in Australia. Palaeobotanical and geomorphological analysis of sediments dated from 15,000 BP have provided valuable information about climatic and vegetation changes in Australia since the Pleistocene. Peatlands such as this which accumulate over a long period of time have high research value. Their sediments act as repositories for valuable information about ecosystem history and environmental changes in the locality. Carbonised particles from cores taken from the swamp have provided important evidence of the impact of humans on the vegetation and landscape of the region since the beginning of the Holocene.

Thus, the A&W; flavor was intended to taste like a root beer float, while the latter is comparable to an orange creamsicle or Sunkist float. The drinks were creamy in nature and contained little carbonation, and no caffeine. Ingredients included skim milk, cream, and nitrous oxide to create foam. While it was recommended that they be served chilled, refrigeration of Floats is not mandatory. Available in 11.5-ounce, vintage soda-shop-inspired glass bottles with twist-off tops, Floats were sold at major US retail, grocery, and convenience stores. Marketing The product's first press release was issued on January 2, 2008, which included bottle design photos, suggested retail prices, and other information. In the press release, Andrew Springate, vice president of marketing, stated: :\\"For years, beverage makers have tried to crack the code and develop an indulgent drink that tastes like a homemade float...

In the early 1920s he met photographer Edward Weston by chance in Carmel, California and began making photographs as a hobby. He was earning a living as a stockbroker, a career he continued throughout his life. In 1932 he became a founding member of Group f/64 along with Weston, Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham and several others. Later that year he showed nine prints (the same number as Weston) in the landmark Group f/64 show at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. While participating in the group, he was also able to collect many of the other photographers prints because of earnings as a stockbroker. Cunningham recalls that Swift bought all of the prints from the first show, which, if he paid the listed price for each photo, would have cost him a grand total of $845 for 80 prints. After Group f/64 dissolved in 1935, Swift's interest in photography waned. He is not known to have exhibited again. When he died in 1962, his widow Florence Swift assembled his collection of photographs from members of Group f/64, sought additional donations from some of the original members of the group, and donated the entire collection to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Patrick Henry is one of four high schools in Hanover County, and the only High school in the western half of the county. In 1959, after years of deliberation, Patrick Henry High School began with the consolidation of Beaverdam, Henry Clay, Montpelier, and Rockville high schools. The western Hanover County high school enrolled students in grades eight through twelve. The name of the school, as well as the name of its literary publications, The Voice, The Spark, and The Orator, reference the history of Patrick Henry, Hanover County's most illustrious citizen. Even the school colors of red, white, and blue are a patriotic symbol of history. In 1969, Patrick Henry High and John M. Gandy High School merged to form one integrated student body. Also in 1969, a new junior high school was built, and Patrick Henry opened that school year as a senior high school serving students in grades ten through twelve. When the junior high school was changed to a middle school in 1988, Patrick Henry became a high school enrolling students in grades nine through twelve. The school campus of West Patrick Henry Road, which consists of a complex of buildings, began as a campus style school. Additions of an auditorium, classrooms, cafeteria, new gymnasium, and renovations to the media center and administrative offices resulted in an all-enclosed facility in 1992. As the population and the needs of the school have changed, so have the dimensions of the school. A new addition/renovation was added to the facility in the fall of 2001 providing state-of-the-art career and technical education opportunities. This addition consisted of a broadcasting studio, a bio- technology lab, a communication technology center, a computer-assisted drafting lab, and three classrooms. Patrick Henry celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2009. Patrick Henry High has an International Baccalaureate program, as well as a NJROTC program. Patrick Henry High is especially known for its NJROTC program that is consistently ranked among the top in the state of Virginia.

The school offers classes in classical and contemporary dance, musical theater and drama, instrumental music, technical theater, visual art, and digital media and filmmaking. It has Ph.D.s on its faculty and what the San Diego Union Tribune calls \\"a formidable fund-raising auxiliary\\", the CoSA Foundation.  History  The idea for the school materialized in 1993. The school was founded in 1996 by Kris McClung and had 60 students when it opened it doors in 1996. In 2007, CoSA unveiled a $12 million theater arts complex that includes a 650-seat main-stage theater, a black-box theater, scene shop, music and drama rooms, administrative offices, and a fly loft. In 2005, four evacuees of Hurricane Katrina relocated from the wind and rain damaged New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.

Despite its name, it is not located in Tobyhanna Township. History \\"Tobyahanna\\" is derived from an American Indian word meaning \\"a stream whose banks are fringed with alder.\\" In the late 1800s, the Tobyhanna and Lehigh Lumber Company operated a lumber mill, clothes pin factory and silk mill in what was then called the Village of Tobyhanna Mills. In September 1900, N S Brittain, a prominent resident of Coolbaugh Township and cashier of the East Stroudsburg Bank, purchased virtually the entire village, consisting of over 30 dwellings and 120 acres of the land but none of the former mill equipment. The lumber company sold the land, depleted of its lumber, for USD $10,000. The Monroe Water Supply Company had purchased most of the lumber company's property, over 32,000 acres, in March 1899. The site was transitioning from forest products to the harvesting of ice.\\"Bought A Whole Village\\", The Wilkes-Barre Record, 6 September 1900, page 5 column 2, Newspapers.com From about 1900 to 1936, Tobyhanna lakes were the site of active ice industries. The ice was cut from the lakes during the winter and stored in large barn-like structures. During the rest of the year, the ice was added to railroad boxcars hauling fresh produce and meats destined for East Coast cities. In 1912, Tobyhanna had a Delaware, Lackawanna & Western railway station, Tobyhanna station, telegraph, and post office. The federal government acquired land within Tobyhanna that became the Tobyhanna Military Reservation, later Tobyhanna Army Depot, which was used as an Artillery training ground. Edward B. Reed, in The Field Artillery Journal (January–March 1917), described Tobyhanna based on his experiences with the Yale Batteries during their training: \\"The camp at Tobyhanna is on a rocky, treeless crest from which no trace of man is visible. About are mountains and uncultivated valleys. The village of Tobyhanna is interesting only because it contains a station that enables you to leave it. No better place for work could be found.\\" In recent years, due to its location between the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and development of new homes, many families have moved to the Poconos. Some Tobyhanna residents choose to commute to the city via Interstate 380, Interstate 80, or Interstate 84. Pennsylvania Route 611 runs southeast from Tobyhanna towards Pocono Township. Today, the train route east toward New York has laid dormant since the mid-1960s. However, work is underway towards possible extension of commuter rail (Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project) to the village, as a means to reduce roadway crowding en route to New York City. Forest scene on the Tobihanna, Alleghany Mountains (circa 1832): aquatint by Karl Bodmer from the book \\"Maximilian, Prince of Wied’s Travels in the Interior of North America, during the years 1832–1834\\" Geography The landscape of the area is of broad, flat areas intermixed with low hills covered with a northern hardwood forest. Common tree species are beech, birch, and maple. Education Two schools are located within Tobyhanna: Clear Run Elementary Center (CREC), which teaches Kindergarten through second grade, and Clear Run Intermediate School (CRIS), which generally houses students grades 3 through 6. The two schools share the Clear Run campus, which is located on Memorial Boulevard (PA-611). Tobyhanna schools are part of the Pocono Mountain School District.

Career Rich spent nearly 30 years as a war correspondent for NBC News. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he became a U.S. Marine in 1942 and made four D-Day landings in the Pacific Theater. After the war, while working in Tokyo for William Randolph Hearst's International News Service, he interviewed General Douglas MacArthur and traveled with Emperor Hirohito. Additionally, he covered Shanghai's fall to the communists. Rich began working for NBC in late 1950 and arrived in Korea less than a week after the war began. He worked there for over three years- longer than any other American correspondent. Having been used mostly for radio, he appeared on The Today Show to cover the ceasefire talks and eventually became a television correspondent. After having covered the Korean War, he took a wide variety of assignments, heading the NBC bureau in Berlin for four years and reporting on the Vietnam War for ten years. He reported on nearly every major armed conflict that occurred during his time at NBC. By the end of his career, he became NBC's senior Asian correspondent and was appointed vice-president of RCA Corporation. After having been retired for many years, Rich was featured in NBC Nightly News' Making a Difference segment on July 24, 2008. Korean War coverage and photos Rich, a Peabody Award winner, had finally released the photographs that he had taken while covering the Korean War in 1950. The photos, taken with a Nikon Camera and covering a wide variety of subjects from children to generals, are all in color, presenting a rare picture of the \\"Forgotten War\\", which is known mostly through black and white images. He had taken hundreds of photos of the Korean War, but never of any other war. Forty of the photos were displayed at the KORUS HOUSE in the Korean Embassy in Washington DC from July 24, 2008 and remained so until August, 11. The photos were then also featured in an article in the November 2008 issue of the Smithsonian Magazine. In 2010, Rich sold the rights to distribute 173 photos to Seoul Selection for the first time.

Born a commoner, he worked as a gentleman-in-waiting and steward to several powerful Parliamentarians in the period up to the English Civil War. He is remembered as a minor playwright, who wrote several plays for London's Blackfriars Theatre, and as the author of The History of Great Britain, being the Life and Reign of King James I, which documents the anti-Stuartism prevalent in the late Caroline era. Biography Wilson was born in Great Yarmouth, England, the son of John Wilson and his wife Suzan, according to the baptismal register, but of Richard Wilson, according to an entry in the matriculation register at Trinity College, Oxford, which he later attended. In the 1620–1625 period he served as secretary to Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, whom he accompanied on military campaigns on the Continent. Despite getting on well with Essex for 15 years, Wilson was dismissed when the earl's second wife took up against him. Thereafter Wilson received a monthly pension from Essex and the opportunity for a formal education. At the age of 35, he entered Oxford University (1631–1633) to study first medicine and then religion. Dismayed by the rampant corruption among the clergy, he left the university and later entered the service of Essex's cousin, Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, as a steward. He returned to Essex's service for the English Civil War. Wilson had a reputation as an adventurer. His autobiographical Observations of God's Providence, in the Tract of my Life,Paul Delaney, British Autobiography in the Seventeenth Century, London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1969. records some of his adventures, such as his 1642 rescue of Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers from anti- Catholic rioters.Keith Lindley, The English Civil War and Revolution: A Sourcebook, London, Routledge, 1998; pp. 94–95. Works=Theatre Wilson's autobiography contains observations on the private theatrical performances conducted in aristocratic households in the 17th century. He himself is likely to have written several plays for private entertainments during his tenure with Essex. He recounts several instances of his work being performed at the home of Essex's grandmother, the Countess of Leicester. Only three of these plays have survived: the tragicomedy The Inconstant Lady, premiered by the King's Men at the royal palace at Hampton Court in London on 30 September 1630, The Swisser premiered at London's Blackfriars Theatre in 1631, and The Corporal, also performed by the King's Men at Blackfriars and is speculatively dated to 1633. Though it is clear that Wilson wrote The Inconstant Lady while still in service with Essex, it is unclear whether his latter two plays were completed during that period or his time at Oxford. Dating is difficult, because none of the plays were published during the 17th century and The Corporal has survived only in a fragmentary manuscript that ends with Act II, scene 1.Alfred Harbage, \\"Elizabethan and Seventeenth-Century Manuscripts,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association Vol. 50 No. 3 (September 1935), pp. 687–699; see pp. 695–696. The other two dramas remained in manuscript until later publication: The Inconstant LadyLinda V. Itzoe, Arthur Wilson's The Inconstant Lady: A Critical Edition, New York, Garland, 1980. in 1814 and The Swisser in 1904. The Swisser was performed in 1631 by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. The manuscript preserves a cast list for that original production – significant as one of only seven cast lists for the company that survive from the later 1620s or early 1630s. History Wilson's notable The History of Great Britain, being the Life and Reign of King James I was published in 1653, a year after his death. Indeed, none of Wilson's literary efforts made it into print in his lifetime. Wilson was not an admirer of the House of Stuart, as his history reveals. He reflects negatively on various figures in the Stuart era, including Sir Francis Bacon. Poetry Wilson also wrote verse. His \\"Upon Mr. J. Donne and his Poems\\" has been considered one of the better elegies on the poet and was printed in the first collection of John Donne's poems as a tribute.Poems by John Donne with elegies of the author’s death, pp.397-9 ReferencesExternal links *1812 Chalmers’ Biography – Arthur Wilson Category:English dramatists and playwrights Category:English historians Category:1595 births Category:1652 deaths Category:English male dramatists and playwrights Category:English male non-fiction writers ","title":"Arthur Wilson (writer)"},{"id":"18656678","text":"With or Without You is a 2003 comedy drama film directed by G.

It was intended to replace the Type 38 75 mm field gun and the Type 41 75 mm cavalry gun in front line combat units but, due to operational and budgetary constraints, only a small number were produced, and the Type 38 and Type 41 continued to be used.Bishop, The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II. The Type 95 number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, 2595 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1935 in the Gregorian calendar.War Department TM-E-30-480 Handbook on Japanese Military Forces September 1944 p 400 History and development Prior to World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army was largely equipped with Krupp cannons from Germany. After the Versailles Treaty, the Japanese Army switched to the French Schneider company, and developed the Type 90 75 mm field gun loosely based on the Schneider et Cie Canon de 85 mle 1927. However, the Schneider design was very complex and expensive to build, requiring very tight dimensional tolerances which were beyond the limits of Japanese industry to sustain at the time. Maintenance was also difficult to sustain in front line combat service.Mayer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan. pp. 57-59 The Army Technical Bureau, following combat experience gained in the invasion of Manchuria and the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars reverted to a simpler and more rugged design for the Type 95 field gun, which entered production in 1935. The Type 95 75 mm gun has an appearance similar to the Model 90 75 mm gun. It is derived from the Model 1933 Schneider 75, which it closely resembles.US Department of War Special Series No 25 Japanese Field Artillery October 1944 However, only a total of 261 units were produced, and the Type 38 75 mm field gun and the Type 41 75 mm cavalry gun continued to be used by front line combat units until the surrender of Japan. Type 95 on Taki's Imperial Japanese Army Design Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, sits astride a captured Japanese 75 mm gun while addressing men of the Royal Armoured Corps in Mandalay, 21 March 1945 Although occasionally mentioned as a copy of the French Schneider et Cie Canon de 75 Mle 1933, this connection is dubious. The Type 95 essentially utilized the Model 38 (improved) weapon with sliding-wedge type breechblock and hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism on the split trail carriage used on the Type 90. This hybrid design addressed the issue of the heavy weight of the Type 90, which had created problems with field commanders, as well as the need for a simpler, more rugged design that could be transported by a team of six horses.Chamberlain, Light and Medium Field Artillery As with the Type 90, the Type 95 was built in two versions: one with wooden wheels suitable for animal draft, and another with solid rubber tires and a stronger suspension for towing by motor vehicles. Since it weighs only 400 pounds more than the Model 41 cavalry gun, it is possible that the Model 95 may have been intended to replace that weapon. However, its use on Saipan and its close resemblance to the heavier Model 90 may indicate that the latter weapon was too heavy for efficient horse-draft, and too complex for the capabilities of Japanese industry. Though the Model 95 was split-trailed, it actually weighed less than the improved Model 38 75 mm gun. The Model 95 was much lighter than its Schneider prototype, and had a sliding-wedge rather than an interrupted thread breechblock. It incorporated all features of modern Japanese design. Combat record The appearance of the Type 95 75 mm field gun caused considerable confusion with both Allied military intelligence and with Japanese troops. The Type 95 was inferior in technology and performance to its predecessor, with less range and lower muzzle velocity. US Technical Manual E 30-480 Although cheaper to build and to maintain, and less in weight, it was not well received by field commanders. It was primarily assigned to units in China.

Population about 500. Largely traditional agriculture, teas, coffees, rice. It is also a site of a Thai Royal Projects where high value plants are grown for market. It is a home-stay village and tourists are welcome to stay with a family as a guest and to partake in daily life such as growing crops, looking after animals, cutting bamboo etc. It has a small hydro-electric power station of capacity 40 kW which also exports to the national grid. The project began in 1983. Access to the village is by steep winding narrow road suitable only for small vehicles.  Geography  Maekampong village is in Mae On District, about 50 kilometers northeast of Chiang Mai province, in northern of Thailand. Mae Kampong Village has 120 families, with about 500 population. The total area of the village is about 6.22 square kilometers. The terrain is generally highland and up to 1,300 meters above sea level.  Weather  Mostly cold and humid throughout the year.  History  Mae Kam Pong is a small village located near the creek surrounded by yellow flowers called Kampong flower. Hence, the name of the village. It is the name of the flowers combined with the word ‘Mae’ from the river that pass through the village. Mae Kam Pong Village is about 100 years old. Although the village of Baan Mae Kampong was not officially founded until the early 1900s, it is thought that the first farmers moved to the area from nearby Doi Saket more than 200 years ago so most of the population migrated from Doi Saket for agriculture. Then the settlers came here to do agriculture which were to make a local delicacy known as “Mieng” from fermented tea leaves. Over the years, the demand for Mieng dropped and the villagers started to look for other sources of income. *In the 1980s, the people of Mae Kampong began growing coffee under the Royal Project. The villagers also used the stream running through the village to produce hydro-electric power. *In the 1990s, Thai government encouraged each sub- district or ‘Tambon’ to produce a product, service or activity that could be associated to what is called OTOP (Thaizer, 2018). The idea of OTOP was initially a concern for the village headman until he decided to propose Mae Kampong as an eco-tourism village to take advantage of the natural surroundings. Mae Kampong accommodation program has proven to be a big success benefiting visitors and villagers alike. The village acts as a co-operative with the revenue brought into the village used to help local projects to support the community. Afterwards, the village won awards of accommodation and various eco-tourism initiatives.  Traditions/Culture  *A traditional northern Thai dinner is laid out on a circular tray known as a ‘khan-toke‘, filled with delicious Lanna food. \\\\- New Year's Day or the Songkran Festival in April. There will be a Lanna style of the North, such as building a sand dune in village's temple. *Sibsongpeng or the twelfth Day of twelfth celebrated on the 15th day of the lunar month, which usually corresponds to September. This is a dedication to charity for the ancestors who passed away. Together, villagers build sand pagodas or the sand pile inside the temple.  Landmarks = Flight of the Gibbon  Eco-tourism at Mae Kampong was supported by the ziplining company, Flight of the Gibbon. The adventure activity brings tourists to the area who might have not ever visited the place and experienced the local way of life and traditional Lanna hospitality which is found in Mae Kampong. Mae Kampong Waterfall Mae Kampong Waterfall is the origin of the creek that runs through the village. Some seven stories in height, it is situated at the far end of the village, and offers clear cold water and banks covered in ferns and moss.  Kanta Prueksa Temple (Wat Mae Kampong)  The village and the temple are built together with the community settlement. The chapel is in the middle of the pond; the old temple made from hardwood and crafted teak wood in Lanna design.

They are named after Franco P. Preparata who first described them in 1968. Although non-linear over GF(2) the Preparata codes are linear over Z4 with the Lee distance. Construction Let m be an odd number, and n = 2^m-1. We first describe the extended Preparata code of length 2n+2 = 2^{m+1}: the Preparata code is then derived by deleting one position. The words of the extended code are regarded as pairs (X, Y) of 2m-tuples, each corresponding to subsets of the finite field GF(2m) in some fixed way. The extended code contains the words (X, Y) satisfying three conditions # X, Y each have even weight; # \\\\sum_{x \\\\in X} x = \\\\sum_{y \\\\in Y} y; # \\\\sum_{x \\\\in X} x^3 + \\\\left(\\\\sum_{x \\\\in X} x\\\\right)^3 = \\\\sum_{y \\\\in Y} y^3. The Preparata code is obtained by deleting the position in X corresponding to 0 in GF(2m). Properties The Preparata code is of length 2m+1 − 1, size 2k where k = 2m + 1 − 2m − 2, and minimum distance 5. When m = 3, the Preparata code of length 15 is also called the Nordstrom–Robinson code.

It was released under Manhattan Records on March 9, 2004. Critical reception Alex Henderson of AllMusic concludes his review with, \\"Fearless is not an album that goes out of its way to push the smile button; at times, Noble's observations can be dark and melancholy. But if Fearless is less than optimistic on the whole, it is also impressively honest and sincere – emotionally, Noble really lays it on the line, and she shows a great deal of promise on this superb debut.\\" Steve Morse of The Boston Globe has this to say about Fearless. \\"Rarely will you hear an artist go from tender apology (as in \\"A Dream About You,\\" in which Noble takes the blame for fumbling a relationship) to no-nonsense anger (as in \\"I Won't,\\" which, she said, some people have called her \\"Alanis Morissette song\\"). It added up to a profound emotional ride – and here's some further news: Noble's album is even better, because it has a band behind her and some string arrangements tastefully done by Mardin. Right now, Noble is being marketed as a \\"hot adult-contemporary\\" artist, whatever that means, but if you like piano ballads from the heart and don't care about labels, then she's worth discovering.\\" Track listingMusicians *Keri Noble: Piano, Main Vocal *Jeff Arundel: Six- and Twelve- String Electric Guitars, Gut String Guitar, Backing Vocals, Loops (tracks 2, 4, 8 and 11) *Rob Arthur: Keyboards, Accordion, Backing Vocals, Bass Guitar (track 3), Loops (tracks 2, 4 and 8), Drum Programming (track 5) *Jeff Bailey: Bass Guitar *Kathleen Johnson: Vocal Backing *Rich Mercurio: Drums, Percussion, Loops (track 11) Additional Musicians *John Conte: Bass Guitar (track 9 and 10) *Ann Klein: Lap Steel Guitar (track 3 and 5), Mandolin (track 10) *John Herchert: Electric Guitar (track 8) *Jeff Victor: Organ (track 1) *Kathleen Johnson: Backing Vocals (track 6) *Jonathan Dinklage: Violin (track 3) *Dirk Freymuth: Electric Guitar (track 11) *String section (tracks 2, 6 and 12) **Jonathan Dinklage: Violin **Antoine Silverman: Violin **Chris Cardona: Viola **Anja Wood: Cello **Wolfgang: Cello The song \\"If No One Will Listen\\" was re-recorded for Kelly Clarkson's 2009 album All I Ever Wanted, which Clarkson received a production credit for.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Jeziorzany. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Lubartów and north-west of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 780, and used to be a town in 1498 - 1870. The village was originally called Przetoczno; in 1564 its name was changed into Lysobyki, and in 1965, to Jeziorzany. It is located on a small island, in the middle of the Wieprz river valley. Jeziorzany is famous for its 16th century street grid system, which has not changed for almost 500 years. Most of the houses are made of timber, with specially decorated porches and window shutters facing the streets. The history of Przetoczno dates back to February 3, 1498, when, upon request of Voivode of Sandomierz, Mikolaj z Ostrowa, King Jan Olbracht granted it town charter. In 1530, the town belonged to the Zbaski family, and in the same year, Lukasz Zbaski asked King Sigismund I Old to confirm the town charter. In 1564, the name of the town was changed into Lysobyki, and until the Partitions of Poland, it was part of County of Stezyca, Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1815 - 1915, Lysobyki belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and in 1831, during the November Uprising, a skirmish took place here between Polish and Russian units. In 1870 the Russians stripped Lysobyki of the town charter; same happened to a number of other towns in northern Lesser Poland. In 1965, the name of the village was changed into Jeziorzany.

He is also a composer of symphonic music. Siciliani was born in Florence, Italy, the son of Ambra and , the celebrated opera impresario. Siciliani currently resides in Columbus, Ohio, where he was the music director of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra from 1992 to 2004. Life and career Siciliani's early life was spent growing up in the opera world of Italy where his father was the director of the country's most prominent opera company, La Scala from 1957 until 1966. His musical interests were formed while attending his father's rehearsals where he had the opportunity to rub shoulders with the world's leading conductors, musicians and opera stars. Siciliani received his musical training at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan and at the Santa Cecilia Academy in Rome. His studies focused on conducting, which he studied with Franco Ferrara, piano, and composition, graduating with highest honors in all three. As a conductor, Siciliani has divided his time between opera and the symphonic repertoire. In opera, he conducted extensively at the New York City Opera\\"Opera: La rondine Returns to City\\" by Donal Henahan, The New York Times, July 10, 1985 and made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera on opening night of the 1988/1989 season.\\"The Met Season Opens With Cav and Pag\\" by John Rockwell, The New York Times, November 6, 2008. Most recently he conducted at the Mariinsky Theatre (formerly the Kirov) in Saint Petersburg, Russia in 2008. As a symphonic conductor he has performed with major orchestras in Prague, Munich, Cologne, Dallas, Pittsburgh, and Washington DC, among many others. From 1992 to 2004 he was the music director of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. During his time on the podium the orchestra achieved some of its greatest successes to date, increasing its audience and celebrating its 50th anniversary with a debut appearance at Carnegie Hall.\\"From the Depths of Ohio Energy Onstage and Off\\" by Allan Kozinn, The New York Times, April 24, 2001 Siciliani's vivid interpretations of the romantic symphonic repertoire and of Italian opera endeared him to audiences in Columbus where he remains a popular figure. In July 2008, he was enthusiastically received when he returned to the podium to conduct the musicians of the Columbus Symphony in a benefit concert during the CSO's recent contract dispute.\\"Maestro Siciliani brings out best of musicians\\" by Barbara Zuck, The Columbus Dispatch, July 28, 2008. Currently, Siciliani maintains his career as a conductor, making guest appearances in Europe and the U.S. He also continues composing, writing works for symphony and chorus.  Early life  Siciliani grew up in Florence and Milan in the home of his parents Ambra and Francesco Siciliani. His father was one of the most important and powerful Artistic Directors in Europe in the 20th century who helped revive some of Italy’s great opera houses after World War II. Francesco Siciliani was Artistic Director and Manager of La Scala in Milan, The San Carlo in Naples, La Ferenci in Venice, and Theatre Covenale in Florence. He was famous for promoting the early career of such artists as Maria Callas, Renata Tebaldi, and Mario del Monaco. Alessandro attended all of his father’s rehearsals at the famed Teatro Alla Scala from the time he was a young boy and it instilled in him a deep affinity for opera. Renata Tebaldi was his Godmother. Siciliani studied at the Giuseppe Verdi Milano Conservatory and at Santa Cecilia in Rome graduating with highest honors in piano, composition, and conducting. He studied conducting with the legendary Franco Ferrara, Leonard Bernstein, Lorin Maazel, Ricardo Muti, and Zubin Mehta. Siciliani also taught Theory and Solfeggio at the Conservatory of L’Aquila in Abruzzo 1979-1983, as well as Theory and Harmony at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in rome 1983-1988  Career  After graduating from Santa Cecilia Conservatory, Siciliani started making guest conducting appearances with orchestras all over the United States and Europe including at the New York City Opera, Metropolitan Opera in New York, Opera company of Philadelphia, Wolf Trap in Washington, DC, Pittsburgh Symphony, Atlanta Symphony, Dallas Symphony, Prague symphony, Radio Orchestra of Munich, National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico City, English Chamber Orchestra, Teatro dell’Opera of Rome, Teatro Liceo of Barcelona, as well as orchestras in Hong Kong, St. Petersburg, Sao Paolo, Buenos Aires and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. among others. Maestro Siciliani took the helm of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra 1992-2004 where he led the orchestra’s first recordings in over 20 years and he took the Columbus Symphony Orchestra to debut at Carnegie Hall in 2001.

Another group of Jews from Michów were loaded on wagons and taken to the railway station in Klementowice, from which they were sent to both Sobibór and Majdanek in May 1942. The 2,000 Jews of Michów ceased to exist and the Jewish community was never reconstituted.

The school is part of the Wasco Union High School District and takes in incoming freshmen from the Wasco Union School District, Maple School District, Lost Hills Union School District, Semitropic School District, St. John's Catholic School, and North Kern Christian School. The school's auditorium is the City of Wasco's only listing on the National Register of Historic Places. History WUHS was established in 1914 when the voters of the Cleveland, Maple, Poplar, Wildwood, Semitropic and Wasco elementary school districts approved the formation of a high school, to coincide with the new addition of the Wasco Union High School District that year. In the inaugural year, 28 students were enrolled at WUHS, and classes were held in a rented auditorium-like building called Wasco Hall. In August 1916, a new high school building for WUHS was approved; it was completed within six months and cost about $50,000. 69 students were enrolled at the time of the dedication on March 3, 1917. After 1917, as new structures were added to the campus, the original building was referred to simply as the Main Building.WUHS History In the years following, a host of new buildings were added to the campus: an industrial arts building in 1925, an auditorium in 1929, a gymnasium in 1931, an agricultural addition to the industrial arts building in 1934, the first phase of the science building in 1935, and the second phase in 1939. A cafeteria and a language arts building were added in 1949, a library and a music building in 1953, a new classroom building and a bus garage in 1957, and a new administration building in 1959. In recent years, WUHS has undergone tremendous change. For instance, the enrollment pattern from the 1925-1926 school year through the 2005-2006 school year showed the school's student body expanding every decade (aside from 1975-1976 school year through 1985-1986), which is revealed in the following figures, given in ten year increments: 1925-1926 (143 students); 1935-1936 (299 students); 1945-1946 (385 students); 1955-1956 (546 students); 1965-1966 (879 students); 1975-1976 (869 students); 1985-1986 (854 students); 1995-1996 (960 students) and 2005-2006 (1,551 students). This led to an increase in student enrollment and, should the Wasco Union High School District sustain its present rate of growth, projections indicate that the enrollment at WUHS would reach 2,200 students by 2010. This led the district to begin preliminary planning for a second comprehensive high school to take in the influx of students within the district. Auditorium The school's auditorium is the oldest building on its campus. The Renaissance Revival auditorium was designed by Ernest J. Kump. In addition to school performances, the building also hosts social events and visiting musicians, performers, and preachers. The auditorium was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Academics All students enrolled at WUHS must at least meet the following criteria before graduation:WUHS Graduation Requirements *4 years of English (40 credits) *3 years of Math (30 credits) *2 years of Science (20 credits) *2 years of P.E. (20 credits) *1 year of U.S. History (10 credits) *1 year of World History (10 credits) *1 year of Government/Economics (10 credits) *1 year of Fine Arts (10 credits) *1 year of Freshman Reqs. (10 credits) *60 credits of electives In total, 220 credits are necessary for a student at WUHS to graduate. Every student who graduates must also pass the CAHSEE and an approved Algebra course. Because WUHS is situated in a largely rural community, the school has for many years offered a program that places heavy emphasis on the development of both vocational and agricultural skills. Agriculture remains a major element of the school's curriculum, as evidenced by the fact that some 500 WUHS students take agriculture related course work. Agriculture students have an opportunity to learn the practical aspects of agriculture on the district's school farm, which operates in conjunction with a farm lab where instruction is provided in welding, agricultural mechanics, plant science, and animal care. In addition, WUHS provides the following advanced courses for those who want a challenge and/or want to get college credit:AP Classes Offered at WUHS *AP Biology *AP Calculus AB *AP English Language and Composition *AP English Literature and Composition *AP Spanish Language *AP Spanish Literature *AP World History *AP U.S. History Athletics The athletic director for WUHS is Raul Rangel.

Life He entered the Society of Jesus at Florissant, Missouri, in 1831. After the usual course of Jesuit training, he was appointed to teach in the colleges in the Missouri province of the Society. While engaged in teaching he proved himself to be a finished Greek scholar. Works He composed in Latin the De Imitatione Sacri Cordis Jesu. It was written to promote devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in fulfilment of a vow he had made in a time of illness. He sent the manuscript to Rome in 1846, and ten years later it was approved by Father General Roothaan. The work was published on the Benzinger press at Einsiedeln, 1863. It was translated into English by Father Fastre and published at Cincinnati in 1865.Online reproduction Translations were also made into French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Flemish, and Hungarian. The French translation, published at Besançon, passed through eighteen editions between the years 1864 to 1887. Sommervogel gives the titles of two English, two Flemish, and four French versions of Father Arnoudt's work. According to Father de Smet, the well known missionary, Father Arnoudt left at his death the following manuscripts: a Greek epic poem of about 1,200 verses, a collection of Greek odes, and Greek grammar, and these ascetical works: The Glories of Jesus, The Delight of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and a collection of spiritual retreats entitled The Abode of the Sacred Heart.

His museums were noted for their interactivity as children could often even borrow animals.  Early life  Forbes appreciation for nature was fostered during time spent at his family's summer cottage on Birch Island in Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. As a child he also was a frequent visitor to the Boston Children's Museum, the Brooklyn Children's Museum, and the American Museum of Natural History. As a teenager, Forbes befriended William T. Hornaday, a noted zoologist and conservationist. Hornaday worked at the Smithsonian Museum and was instrumental in developing the animal collections and exhibits that would later become the National Zoo. Hornaday was also responsible for the creation of the Bronx Zoo. After retiring from the Bronx Zoo, Hornaday moved to Stamford, Connecticut. The teenage Forbes was a Boy Scout in Stamford at the time, and he approached Hornaday at his home after discovering a frog with a glowing belly during a troop hike. The two held a lengthy discussion to arrive at the conclusion that the frog had swallowed a firefly. After completing high school, Forbes enrolled at the University of Iowa to study in their museum training program. He later briefly studied at the Boston School of Fine Arts before enrolling at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine where he studied for a year.  Later life  In 1937, Forbes served as a scientist in the Arctic expedition of explorer Donald MacMillan. Also in 1937, Forbes founded the William T. Hornaday Foundation for children's museums which later became the Natural Science for Youth Foundation. Forbes was instrumental in the establishment of many prominent museums and nature centers including the Kansas City Museum of History and Science, Earthplace in Westport, Connecticut and the Chattahoochee Nature Center in Roswell, Georgia. Later in his career, worried about rampant real-estate development, he shifted his attention towards conservation, and he founded the Southeast Land Preservation Trust in 1976. He would subsequently establish several forest preserves.

Toytown Germany is partnered with major German news companies including Der Spiegel, Deutsche Welle,http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,,9221,00.html and Die Welt. News feeds from those companies are published on the website. In return, the latest German news related discussions from the TT chat forum are published on the English news pages of Die Welt.https://www.welt.de/english-news/ While those mainstream news companies provide professional reporting, Toytown Germany provides the general public with a community platform on which to discuss the latest news from Germany.  History  The site was originally created in August, 2002 as \\"Toytown Munich\\". The name originates from the observation that Munich was an unusually clean, well-organised, and crime-free city, relatively free of most urban blight including graffiti and slums. In mid-2006 the site merged with Britboard, another expatriate site geared toward British expatriates in Germany.

There are many types of MOM software, including for production management, performance analysis, quality and compliance, and human machine interface (HMI). Production management software provides real-time information about jobs and orders, labor and materials, machine status, and product shipments. Performance analysis software displays metrics at the machine, line, plant and enterprise level for situational or historical analysis. Quality and compliance software is used to promote compliance with standards and specifications for operational processes and procedures. HMI software is a form of manufacturing operations management (MOM) software that enables operators to manage industrial and process control machinery using a computer- based interface. Emerging Software Trends Advancements in technology and market demands are enabling new capabilities in MOM software platforms, gradually closing gaps in end-user needs. * Collaboration Capabilities: Collaboration and workflow services support people-to-people, people-to- systems, and systems-to-systems interactions, enforcing procedures and rules while flexibly adapting to real-time situations with alternate workflows and processes. * Security Services: Future manufacturing platforms will leverage common security services that determine roles, responsibilities, authorities, and access across all systems and application functions while fitting into corporate IT security schemes. * Asset & Production Model: Future manufacturing platforms will have a unified asset and production model that supports all of the interrelationships between physical production equipment, facilities, inventory/materials and people, as well as production definitions such as the manufacturing bill of materials, productions orders, etc. This contrasts with older systems that either had subsets of these interrelationships across multiple databases, or could not effectively deal with federating across multiple systems of record. * Operations Database & Historians: Evolving from older systems that had separate historians and production databases that were difficult to correlate across, service-based platforms will have a unified operations database and historian. This will capture and aggregate all time-series and production event information surrounding everything involved in each product and production run with a full genealogy of components and materials, related performance information, and federation across other systems and devices of record. * Visualization and Mobility: Today, different MOM applications support different graphical user interfaces, Web interfaces, specific mobile applications, etc. The future manufacturing platform will provide common visualization and mobility for a consistent user interface experience across different form factors, supporting dedicated and mobile workers that are orchestrated by consistent workflows and procedures. * Smaller and Focused 'Apps': Today’s monolithic systems and applications have too many interdependencies of databases, operate inconsistently, and are not inherently integrated. Being able to take advantage of many of the common software platform services described above, modular apps will be significantly smaller, simpler, and focused. These apps will be much lighter weight in functionality, and, as a result, significantly easier and faster to develop.

He played left- and scored a goal in Huddersfield's 15–10 victory over St. Helens in the 1953 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 25 April 1953, in front of a crowd of 89,588. During the game Devery was injured and as no substitutes were allowed at this time Devery continued to play but he and left winger Lionel Cooper exchanged places and Cooper took over the kicking duties. Devery went on to break the Huddersfield club's record for most points in a season with 332, achieved during the 1952–53 season. He scored over 1,000 points during his English career between 1948–1954. He also made 11-appearances for the Other Nationalities, and one appearance for the British Empire. He was also a teacher at Oakes Elementary school in Huddersfield in the late 1940s, and early 1950s at the same time as Bon Spence the former Huddersfield Town Full back. Coaching career On his return to Sydney, he commenced coaching the Manly-Warringah club in 1955, taking them to a third-place regular season finish. The 1956 season finished with Manly in sixth place, just missing out on a spot in the finals. In 1957 Devery finished his coaching career at Lithgow. Later years Devery moved to the USA where he worked as teacher in a school at an American naval base in Puerto Rico. In 2005 Devery was named as one of the inaugural inductees into the Balmain Tigers Hall of Fame, he was the last surviving member of Huddersfield's 1952–53 Challenge Cup Final winning team. Retiring to Portland, Oregon, he died there on 17 December 2017 at the age of 95.

The Plan Dog memorandum was a 1940 American government document written by Chief of Naval Operations Harold Rainsford Stark. It has been called \\"one of the best known documents of World War II.\\"Ronald H. Spector. Eagle Against The Sun. 1985. . Page 65 Confronting the problem of an expected two-front war against Germany and Italy in Europe and Japan in the Pacific, the memo set out the main options and suggested fighting a defensive war in the Pacific and giving strategic priority to defeating Germany and Italy. The memo laid the basis for the later American policy of Europe first. Background During the Interwar Period, the Joint Planning Committee, which later became the Joint Chiefs of Staff, devised a series of contingency plans for dealing with the outbreak of war with various countries. The most elaborate of them, War Plan Orange, dealt with the possibility of war with Japan. In light of the events of the late 1930s (the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and the German conquest of Poland and Western Europe) American planners realized that the United States faced the possibility of a two-front war in both Europe and the Pacific. War Plan Orange was withdrawn, and five \\"Rainbow\\" plans were put forward. Unlike the earlier colored plans, which had assumed a one-on-one war, the Rainbow plans contemplated both the possibility of fighting multiple enemies and the necessity of defending other western hemisphere nations and aiding Britain. Content The memorandum built upon the conditions described in the Rainbow Five war plan. It described four possible scenarios for American participation in World War II, lettered A through EPlan Dog Memo: :A - War with Japan in which [the United States] would have no allies :B - War with Japan in which [the United States] would have the British Empire... as [an] ally. :C - War with Japan in which she is aided by Germany and Italy, and in which [the United States] is or is not aided by allies. :D - War with Germany and Italy in which Japan would not initially be involved, and in which [the United States] would be allied with the British. :E - [...] consider the alternative of now remaining out of the war, and devoting [...] to exclusively building up [...] defense of the Western Hemisphere. The memorandum, which was submitted to Roosevelt on November 12, 1940, recommended option D, the origin of its name (\\"Dog\\" was D in the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet): > \\"I believe that the continued existence of the British Empire, combined with > building up a strong protection in our home areas, will do most to ensure > the status quo in the Western Hemisphere, and to promote our principal > national interests. As I have previously stated, I also believe that Great > Britain requires from us very great help in the Atlantic, and possibly even > on the continents of Europe or Africa, if she is to be enabled to survive. > In my opinion Alternatives (A), (B), and (C) will most probably not provide > the necessary degree of assistance, and, therefore, if we undertake war, > that Alternative (D) is likely to be the most fruitful for the United > States, particularly if we enter the war at an early date. Initially, the > offensive measures adopted would, necessarily, be purely naval. Even should > we intervene, final victory in Europe is not certain. I believe that the > chances for success are in our favor, particularly if we insist upon full > equality in the political and military direction of the war.\\" The memo also suggested that until hostilities broke out, the US should adopt policy A: > Until such time as the United States should decide to engage its full forces > in war, I recommend that we pursue a course that will most rapidly increase > the military strength of both the Army and the Navy, that is to say, adopt > Alternative (A) without hostilities. \\"The strategy of Plan Dog gained the support of the army and implicitly of President Roosevelt, though he never formally endorsed it. Thus at the end of 1940 a powerful consensus for strategic focus on Germany developed at the highest levels of the American government. At a meeting on January 17, 1941, Roosevelt concluded that the primary objective must be maintenance of the supply lines to Britain and ordered the navy to prepare for the escort of convoys.\\"Waldo H. Heinrichs. Threshold of War: Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Entry into World War II. Oxford University Press, 1988. . Page 38 Aftermath A few weeks after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, at the Arcadia Conference, the United States adopted the recommendations of the memo in the form of the \\"Europe first\\" policy. Although the United States did not go entirely on the defensive in the Pacific, as the memo recommended, the European Theatre was given higher priority in resource allocation throughout the war.

This article explores aspects and issues surrounding the game, as well as the players, and society. Australian Rules is a sport rich in tradition and Australian cultural references, especially surrounding the rituals of gameday for players, officials, and supporters. Popularity Australian rules football is popular amongst indigenous communities. Australian rules football has attracted more overall interest among Australians (as measured by the Sweeney Sports report) than any other football code, and, when compared with all sports throughout the nation, has consistently ranked first in the winter reports, and most recently third behind cricket and swimming in summer.Media Release, Sweeney Sport report for 2006-07 In some of the southern states, it is the most popular sport of all sports. As a football code, it is the most popular form of football in the Northern Territory, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. It is less popular in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland, although there has traditionally been support for the code in regions within those states, such as parts of southern New South Wales including the Riverina and parts of Queensland such as Cairns and the Gold Coast. The AFL teams from Brisbane and Sydney attracted a strong increase in crowds and television audiences when they won four premierships between them from 2001-2005 (and appeared in Grand Finals between 2001 and 2006 inclusive), though crowds and TV ratings have both declined as both teams' performances (in particular the Brisbane Lions who have suffered a decline since losing the 2004 AFL Grand Final) in subsequent years dropped. Demographic and migration trends have affected all football codes in recent years, but most significantly Australian football in Queensland. It is particularly popular amongst indigenous Australian communities. Indigenous Australians are well represented in professional AFL players: while only 2.4% of the population is of indigenous origin, 10% of AFL players identify themselves this way. Australian rules is the national sport of Nauru. Attendance A capacity crowd at an AFL game at AAMI Stadium in Adelaide. Australian rules football is the most highly attended spectator sport in Australia: government figures show that more than 2.5 million people attended games in 2005-06.Sports Attendance, Australian Bureau of Statistics, January 2007. In 2007 (including finals matches), a cumulative 7,049,945 people attended Australian Football League premiership matches, a record for the competition. In 2005, a further 307,181 attended NAB Cup pre-season matches and 117,552 attended Regional Challenge pre-season practice matches around the country. As of 2005 the AFL is one of only five professional sports leagues in the world with an average attendance above thirty thousand (the others are the NFL in the United States and Major League Baseball in the U.S. and Canada, and the top division soccer leagues in Germany and England). In 2007, the average attendance of 38,113 made the AFL the second best attended domestic club league in the world, after only the NFL in the United States. The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest stadium used for Australian rules football and the permanent home of the AFL Grand Final. It is one of the largest sporting stadiums in the world and was the venue for the record Australian rules football attendance of 121,696 at the 1970 VFL Grand Final, between Carlton and Collingwood - which game was also historic, in that it heralded the dawning of a new style of football - still largely in use today, wherein handballing was introduced more to commence the attack from the back line. Redevelopment since then to a mainly seated stadium has reduced the current capacity to approximately 100,000. In addition to the national AFL competition, some semi-professional local leagues also draw significant crowds. Although crowds for state leagues have suffered in recent years, they continue to draw support, particularly for finals matches. The South Australian SANFL drew an attendance of 309,874 in 2006 and the Western Australian WAFL drew an official attendance of 207,154. Other leagues, such as the Victorian VFL Northern Territory Football League and the popular country league Ovens & Murray also charge admission and draw notable crowds (but with no available attendance figures). Outside of Australia, the game has drawn notable attendances only for occasional carnival type events, such as International tests and exhibition matches. Television Part of the 2006 AFL Grand Final pre-match entertainment. The AFL Grand Final is one of the most watched sporting events on television in Australia. The national AFL is the main league which is shown on television in Australia. The 2005 AFL Grand Final was watched by a record television audience of more than 3.3 million people across Australia's five most populous cities--the five mainland state capitals--including 1.2 million in Melbourne and 991,000 in Sydney.Top 20 Programs - Ranking Report (E) 18–24 September, OzTam. In 2006, the national audience was 3.145 million, including 1.182 million in Melbourne and 759,000 in Sydney.Top 20 Programs - Ranking Report (E) 24 September - 30 September 2006 According to OzTAM, in recent years, the AFL Grand Final has reached the top five programs across the five biggest cities in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. In 2007, it was #1 in metropolitan markets. Australian rules football has achieved a #1 rating in the sports category in both 2004 and 2005. Some of the more popular regional leagues in Australia have the \\"match of the week\\" televised locally and free-to-air on ABC Television's respective state networks. The SANFL is the most popular of these regional competitions measuring a total of 1,415,000 television viewers in 2007.SANFL Website Some of these regional leagues also attracted a national audience through free-to- air broadcasting on television networks such as ABC2. OzTAM began measuring these audiences in 2006. Despite a large number of complaints, ABC2 withdrew all of these broadcasts in early 2008. However in 2010 the ABC began replaying these matches nationwide, online via the new ABC iView catch-up TV service. In 2012, the ABC commenced screening replays of the previous weekends VFL, SANFL, WAFL matches in the early hours of the morning during the week from 3.00AM - 5.30AM (local time in each state) nationwide on the ABC1 channel Australian rules also has a nominal but growing international audience. Since 2005, some AFL matches have been shown in the pacific rim region for the first time through the Australia Network. The AFL Grand Final is broadcast to many countries and attracts many million viewers worldwide. This audience has grown to approximately 30 million viewers from 72 countries.Grand final's free kick to economy a tough call According to Roy Morgan Research, more Americans watch Australian Rules Football than Australians. A poll taken between April 2002 and March 2004 showed that 7,496,000 North Americans compared to 7,004,000 Australians watch Australian Rules Football at least occasionally on television.Globalisation of Sport Report 2005 from roymorgan.com (Roy Morgan Single Source USA March 2003-Feb2004) New media The AFL website was the #1 most popular Hitwise Australian sports website in 2004, increasing in market share by 9.86% over that year.Most Popular Australian websites for 2004 revealed from Hitwise In 2006, other consistently high traffic websites in the Australian Top 20 included AFL Dream Team, (Trading Post) AFL Footy Tipping, BigFooty.com and Bomberland.Fast Mover - Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Dream Team In 2006, the search term 'afl' represented the highest number of search terms (2.48%) that delivered users to Hitwise sports category listed websites.Search Terms - Industry Search Term Report for Sports Statistics show that Victorians consist of 43% of all visits to the AFL football category.Victorians Still AFL's Biggest Fans Online Team rivalries Rivalries are one of the main drivers in generating passionate supporter bases. In almost every league, there is a team which everyone loves to hate, like Collingwood, Port Adelaide and even the Southport Sharks. The AFL in particular encourages the building of such rivalries, as a method of increasing publicity for the league, to the point of designating one round each year as Rivalry Round where many of these match-ups are held on the one weekend.Lonergan, Dan; AFL arch rivals - a thing of the past; 2007-04-13 Whilst some rivalries, such as between teams from adjacent areas are still strong, the designation of an entire round of fixtures as Rivalry Round is often criticised due to some arbitrary matchups, or ignoring stronger, more recent rivalries.Baum, G;Footy's drowning in a sea of medals; The Age; 2008-04-12 Traditions of the game Before the start of each AFL games, players run through a banner constructed by supporters. Clothing As part of their uniform, players wear shirts called guernseys, often referred to colloquially as 'jumpers. Guernseys are similar to basketball shirts, but of a more robust design and tight fit. In the early period of the game's development players often wore sleeveless lace-up tops which gradually disappeared between the 1960s and early 1980s. A few players choose to wear a long sleeved variation of the modern guernsey design. Players wore full length pants, before adopting shorts in the 1920s. Tight-fitting shorts were a notable fashion trend in most leagues in the 1980s and some players began to wear hamstring warmers. A brief experiment with lycra by the AFL in the State of Origin series was quickly abandoned for more traditional wear3. Long socks (football socks) are compulsory and boots with moulded cleats or studs for gripping the ground are worn (screw-ins have been banned from most leagues since the 1990s). Some players wear headbands or hair ties to keep the hair out of their faces when playing, though this is rare. Players will sometimes wear arm bands around their mid biceps and triceps, typically of electrical tape, in honour or in memoriam of someone related to the player or their club who recently died. Traditionally, umpires have worn white and were sometimes referred to as \\"white maggots\\"Footy moots 'white maggot' ban from news.com.au amongst supporters. AFL umpires now wear bright colours to also avoid clashes with the player guernseys and AFL goal umpires now wear t-shirts and caps, rather than the traditional white coat and broad brimmed hat (similar to what was worn by many cricket umpires) which they wore before the 1990s. Cheersquads at Australian rules football matches behind the goals wave giant Pom-pons or floggers to signify a goal Meat pies are a tradition at Australian football games. Typical supporter wear includes the team scarf and sometimes beanie (particularly in cooler climates) in the colours of the team. Team guernseys are also worn by supporters. Team flags are sometimes flown by supporters at the start of a game, when a goal is scored, and when their team wins. Gameday and crowd Before AFL matches, it is traditional for teams to run through a crêpe paper banner constructed by the cheersquads of each team. These often feature messages and slogans for the team in the context of the match, such as congratulating a player on a landmark number of games and more recently also sponsorship messages. The banners and sometimes also streamers are used in important local football matches such as finals. Some players are superstitious about running through the banner. As players run through the banners, the team's club song is always played. The winning clubs song is also played at the end of each match. Australian rules supporters are said to \\"barrack\\" for their team. Though other cultures have had an influence at various points in its history, Australian football tends to have different atmosphere to sports like soccer and American football. Partly due to Australian culture, Australian rules spectators are generally more solitary animals. Despite loud shouting and arguing, crowd violence is rare. With the exception of small official cheersquads, spectators at Aussie Rules matches will rarely engage in support for their teams with organised chants, and there is often no segregation between fans. Instead, each individual spectator will most often shout their own support using the nickname of their team i.e. \\"Carn the Crows !\\" or \\"Carn the Maggies\\", or after goals perform simple chants such as \\"Ess-en-don! (clap-clap-clap)\\" or \\"Freo! Freo!\\". In contrast, cheersquads are highly organised, have their own rituals and almost always congregate behind the goals during games. The nature of the sport reflects this method of supporting. While some sports such as English or American football may involve lull periods where large chants reverberate around the ground, Australian rules football is played at a constant, frenetic pace, often leaving the crowd too immersed to take part in 'soccer style' chants. Most professional clubs have official cheersquads which will sometimes wave enormous coloured pompoms known as floggers after the umpire has signalled a goal. American style cheerleading is very rare.Fanfare: Spectator culture and Australian Rules Football edited by Matthew Nicholson. ASSH Studies, 15. Melbourne: Australian Society for Sports History, 2005, pp. 140, A$25.00, paperback, Meat pies, beer and chiko rolls are popular consumables (sometimes noted as a tradition) for supporters at Australian rules matches. At AFL matches mobile vendors walk around the ground selling such pies, yelling out the well-known call of \\"hot pies, cold drinks!\\" At AAMI Stadium in Adelaide; it is tradition to have a barbecue outside the stadium, in the carpark. Many families will bring their barbecues with them. This is particularly popular during the Sunday afternoon matches. At the end of the match, it is traditional for a pitch invasion to occur. Supporters run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of kick-to-kick with their families. In many suburban and country games, this also happens during quarter and half-time breaks. In the AFL in recent years, this tradition has been more strictly controlled with security guards to ensure that players and officials can safely leave the ground. At the largest AFL grounds, this tradition has been banned completely, to protect the surface, much to the discontent of fans. But most smaller regional & interstate grounds (Simonds Stadium & Sydney Showground Stadium, for example) still allow fans onto the field after the game. Sometimes a mid-game pitch invasion is expected for various highly anticipated landmark achievements (such as a player kicking a record number of goals). Reading the AFL Record and recording the goals kicked by players alongside the team lists is also commonly done by spectators. Injuries and prevention Australian rules football is known for its high level of physical body contact compared to other sports such as soccer and basketball. High impact collisions can occur from any direction. Unlike gridiron, padding is not mandatory and is rarely worn. Combined with the range of activity including jumping, running, kicking, twisting and turning this means that injury rates are relatively high in comparison to other sports. Some ruckmen wear shin pads and thigh pads and players with head injuries sometimes wear soft helmets. Mouthguards are worn by most players but are only compulsory in some leagues. Soft tissue injuries are the most frequent, including injuries to the thighs, hamstring and calf muscles. Pre-game warm-up and stretching exercises are a focus of the standard preparation routine for clubs at all levels to minimise these injuries. Osteitis pubis is a condition which particularly affects Australian rules footballers.Research finds cause of osteitis pubis Injuries to the knee, ankle and shoulders are also common. Hospital treated injuries, particularly for broken bones, account for 40 percent of all Australian rules football injuries.Australian rules football - preventing injury Knee reconstructions are among the most commonly incurred career threatening injuries for both professional and amateur players, although professional players frequently continue to play after rehabilitation. Recently some professional players have undergone an innovative surgery that inserts a synthetic ligament in the knee which reduces the time out of football from twelve to three months.Luke Webster's radical knee surgery put to test in WAFL Players can suffer head injuries,Retrospective study of concussive convulsions in elite Australian rules and rugby league footballers: phenomenology, aetiology, and outcome however spinal injuries are extremely uncommon and comparatively much lower than rugby football.Spinal cord injuries in Australian footballers 1997–2002A neck breaking game In cases of injury, players are able to be treated whilst on the ground and umpires generally only stop the play when players are removed from the ground on a stretcher. Most leagues have implemented a blood rule which forces players with bleeding wounds to leave the field for treatment until the bleeding is stopped to prevent the transmission of blood- borne disease. Australian rules football does not have the range or severity of health issues of American football however players have been known to die whilst playing Aussie Rules, though the most common cause is heart failure. The Victorian State Coroner reported five sudden deaths in that state among Australian rules footballers aged under 38 years between 1990-1997. Three of these deaths were attributed to Ischaemic heart disease (mean age, 31.7 years), and the other two to physical trauma.Sudden death due to ischaemic heart disease in young Aboriginal sportsmen in the Northern Territory, 1982-1996 In a study conducted recently of retired VFL/AFL footballers found that the most common problems amongst the group in old age included arthritis, hip replacements and significantly reduced capacity to participate in athletic activity.Life After Football In recent years the AFL has commissioned official studies as well as introduced new rules and precautions aimed at reducing the number and severity of injuries in the sport,AFL Injury Report and there are variation games which significantly reduce the contact and risk of injury to players and allow players of any age to continue to participate. Women A Women's Australian rules football Match between the Melbourne University Mugars and the Darebin Falcons. Women have been involved in Australian football since its inception, with many early match reports remarking on the equal representation of both sexes in the crowds.Daffey, Paul (2 May 2004). \\"AFL gets in touch with its feminine side\\", The Age. Retrieved 19 December 2013. The trend continues with around half of modern day AFL supporters being female, which contrasts with other codes both in Australia and overseas. For instance, only 39% of NRL (rugby league) supporters in Australia are female. There are women's footy players and even umpires in the AFL. Popular culture For many years, the game of Australian rules football captured the imagination of Australian film, music, television and literature. The Club, a critically acclaimed 1977 play by David Williamson, deals with the internal politics of a Melbourne football club steeped in tradition. The play was adapted as a film, directed by Bruce Beresford and starring Jack Thompson and Graham Kennedy, in 1980. Many songs inspired by the game have become popular, none more so than the 1979 hit \\"Up There Cazaly\\", by Mike Brady. Brady followed the hit up with \\"One Day in September\\" in 1987. Both are frequently used in Grand Final celebrations. AFL players and the media Footballers' off-field behaviour is as highly scrutinised as their on-field behaviour. Footballers are held by many in Australia to be role models. Betting \\"Footy tipping\\" is the term for office pools where players nominate which teams will win that week. It is part of the staple office environment in Australia. Traditionally office pools are done with footy tipping posters, however with the modern age these private competitions can be managed by PC or mobile apps. Betting on the AFL is very popular. Violence=Player violence On-field assault has historically been socially tolerated in Australia, but, in recent years, this has changed with some players being charged by police for their on-field actions, including a recent jailing in VictoriaFootballer jailed for on-field assault and the much publicized case involving VFL player Leigh Matthews which ended the public perception that on- field football assaults are somehow legal.Memories are made of this League penalties for such actions have also generally increased in recent yearsEven in battle, players must aim higher and overall violence has decreased over time.Violence in Sport: Some Theoretical and Practical Issues in the Australian Context from the Australian Institute of Criminology Violence has also affected the International Rules Series, with the Irish team objecting to the level of violence tolerated by Australia. Supporter violence=Multiculturalism Australian rules football has involved a diverse section of society and the AFL has multicultural programs to engage people from different backgrounds. Racial vilification The Australian Football League's racial vilification code is an effort to stamp out racism in the sport and it has worked well, however there has been a history of well publicised incidents in the sport. ;1993 * Nicky Winmar reacted to overt racism from the crowd at Victoria Park, Melbourne, turning to face the offending segments of the crowd, lifted his Guernsey and defiantly pointed to his skin (at the end of a game between St Kilda Football Club and Collingwood Football Club).

The YPX was based on the Kawasaki P-1 aircraft developed for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, but with two engines instead of four. Design and development The YPX was to have seated between 100-150 passengers, and would thus have been competitive with the smaller Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family jets on short haul routes. The engine choice had not been made at the time its development was halted. Entry into service was expected to have been somewhere around 2015. However, no prototype has been built. Kawasaki had hoped to cut fuel costs of up to 15% in comparison to the Boeing 737. According to specifications issued in 2007, the base model YPX-11 was to have seated 113 passengers in a two-class arrangement. The YPX-10 was to have seated 93 in two classes while the YPX-12 was to have accommodated 137, implying about 150 in an all-economy arrangement. Standard range for all three body lengths would have been 4,260 km (2,300 nautical miles) but the YPX-10 and YPX-11 were to have extended-range sub-variants flying as far as 5,930 km (3,200 nautical miles).

With no hits in 23 career at-bats, he is tied for the most career MLB at-bats by a non-pitcher without a hit. Career Originally drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 3rd round of the 1970 amateur draft, Potter chose not to sign. However, when he was drafted by the Cardinals out of Mount San Antonio College in the sixth round of the secondary phase of the 1971 amateur draft, he did sign. Potter made his major league debut on September 6, 1976, at the age of 25. Facing pitcher Steve Dunning, Potter went 0–3 with two strikeouts in his big league debut. In 16 at-bats in his first season, Potter did not collect a single hit. However, he did walk once. He appeared in only five games in 1977, collecting no hits in seven at-bats. In total, Potter played in 14 big league games, collecting no hits in 23 at-bats. He is tied with Larry Littleton for most career at-bats by a non-pitcher without a hit. He played his final big league game on October 2, 1977. Potter returned to the minors to bring his professional career to a close. In the 1978 minor league season, Potter hit 22 home runs and drove in 94 RBI. On October 27, 1978, he was sent by the Cardinals to the Seattle Mariners to complete an earlier trade made on June 26, 1978. Originally, the Cardinals sent a player to be named later to the Mariners for José Báez. He hit only five home runs in 117 minor league games in 1979.

The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association represents 1,300 pension funds which together provide pensions for 22 million people and have more than £1000 billion of assets. Members' pension schemes include defined benefit, defined contribution, group personal pensions and statutory schemes such as those in local government. The Association's membership also includes 400 businesses that provide services to pension funds. These include investment managers, law firms, actuarial consultancies and administrators. Describing itself as the voice of its members \\"with government, Parliament and regulators\\", it aims to help pension professionals run better pension schemes, and to advocate for regulation and policies that it considers in the interest of its membership and the industry. It also provides events, training and publications, and works to raise standards in the pensions industry. Role The association promotes the interests of pension funds by lobbying government and regulators (such as the Pensions Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority and EU institutions). It undertakes various research projects covering different aspects of pensions including the size and structure of UK defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, trends in longevity and the changing nature of retirement. Membership of the Association is open to any organisation providing any form of retirement provision for employees and to those providing professional advice and services to pension schemes. It hosts a number of seminars and conferences throughout the year which aim to keep members up-to-date with developments in the pensions industry. The PLSA also provides various training for members through its training Academy and policy- related ‘teach-in’ events. Governance The Association is a not for profit organisation run by the association's Board . The Chair of the Board is Richard Butcher, Managing Director at PTL, where he acts as a non-executive director to pension and investment related entities and professional trustee as well as managing a team of other people doing the same. He has held a non- executive directorship role at the Association since 2013 and chaired its former Defined Contribution Council. The Chief Executive of the Association is Julian Mund, who joined the PLSA as Commercial Services Director at the end of September 2013. The Policy Board, created in October 2018 following a review of the PLSA's governance arrangements, is the Association's main policy-making body. It is made up of 17 appointed members and meets around three times a year to debate key issues. Events The PLSA's Annual Conference and Exhibition is held in October and alternates between the ACC Liverpool and Manchester Central, attracting around 1500 attendees. Speakers come primarily from the UK and European government, the pensions and investment industries and relevant areas of economics and science. Bob Geldof gave the keynote speech at the Annual Conference and Exhibition in Liverpool in 2014 and Andrew Marr appeared in 2018. The government and shadow ministers with pension remits frequently appear. The annual calendar of events also includes: * Investment Conference, held at the EICC in Edinburgh in March * Local Authority Conference, held in the Cotswolds in May * Trustee Conference, held in London in December. Speakers at these events have included former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, BlackRock founder Larry Fink, Al Gore and the Prince of Wales.

Lattice-based constructions are currently important candidates for post-quantum cryptography. Unlike more widely used and known public-key schemes such as the RSA, Diffie-Hellman or elliptic-curve cryptosystems, which could, theoretically, be easily attacked by a quantum computer, some lattice-based constructions appear to be resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers. Furthermore, many lattice-based constructions are considered to be secure under the assumption that certain well-studied computational lattice problems cannot be solved efficiently. History In 1996, Miklós Ajtai introduced the first lattice-based cryptographic construction whose security could be based on the hardness of well-studied lattice problems, and Cynthia Dwork showed that a certain average-case lattice problem, known as Short Integer Solutions (SIS), is at least as hard to solve as a worst-case lattice problem. Public-Key Cryptosystem with Worst-Case/Average-Case Equivalence He then showed a cryptographic hash function whose security is equivalent to the computational hardness of SIS. In 1998, Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, and Joseph H. Silverman introduced a lattice-based public-key encryption scheme, known as NTRU. However, their scheme is not known to be at least as hard as solving a worst-case lattice problem. The first lattice-based public-key encryption scheme whose security was proven under worst-case hardness assumptions was introduced by Oded Regev in 2005, together with the Learning with Errors problem (LWE). Since then, much follow-up work has focused on improving Regev's security proof and improving the efficiency of the original scheme. Much more work has been devoted to constructing additional cryptographic primitives based on LWE and related problems. For example, in 2009, Craig Gentry introduced the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme, which was based on a lattice problem.  Mathematical background  A lattice L \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors \\\\mathbf{b}_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{b}_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. I.e., L = \\\\Big{ \\\\sum a_i \\\\mathbf{b}_i \\\\ : \\\\ a_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\Big}\\\\; . For example, \\\\mathbb{Z}^n is a lattice, generated by the standard orthonormal basis for \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Crucially, the basis for a lattice is not unique. For example, the vectors (3, 1, 4), (1,5,9), and (2, -1, 0) form an alternative basis for \\\\mathbb{Z}^3. The most important lattice-based computational problem is the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP or sometimes GapSVP), which asks us to approximate the minimal Euclidean length of a non-zero lattice vector. This problem is thought to be hard to solve efficiently, even with approximation factors that are polynomial in n, and even with a quantum computer. Many (though not all) lattice-based cryptographic constructions are known to be secure if SVP is in fact hard in this regime.

Security  Lattice-based cryptographic constructions are the leading candidates for public-key post- quantum cryptography. Indeed, the main alternative forms of public-key cryptography are schemes based on the hardness of factoring and related problems and schemes based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm and related problems. However, both factoring and the discrete logarithm are known to be solvable in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Furthermore, algorithms for factorization tend to yield algorithms for discrete logarithm, and vice versa. This further motivates the study of constructions based on alternative assumptions, such as the hardness of lattice problems. Many lattice-based cryptographic schemes are known to be secure assuming the worst- case hardness of certain lattice problems. I.e., if there exists an algorithm that can efficiently break the cryptographic scheme with non-negligible probability, then there exists an efficient algorithm that solves a certain lattice problem on any input. In contrast, cryptographic schemes based on, e.g., factoring would be broken if factoring was easy \\"on an average input, even if factoring was in fact hard in the worst case. However, for the more efficient and practical lattice-based constructions (such as schemes based on NTRU and even schemes based on LWE with more aggressive parameters), such worst-case hardness results are not known. For some schemes, worst-case hardness results are known only for certain structured lattices or not at all.  Functionality  For many cryptographic primitives, the only known constructions are based on lattices or closely related objects. These primitives include fully homomorphic encryption, indistinguishability obfuscation, cryptographic multilinear maps, and functional encryption.

His tenure in that post was the second longest in the College's history. Life and education Pelletier was born in Farmington, New Hampshire, and grew up in Sanford, Maine. He graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Bowdoin College in 1936. He received an MA (1939) and a PhD degree (1947) from Harvard University. Career Following his graduation from Harvard in 1939, Pelletier began teaching (History and Government) at University of Maine at Orono. He remained there until 1945, then returned to Harvard for his PhD. In 1946 he returned to Bowdoin to teach government. During the 1940s he served as consultant to the National Resources Planning Board, and the Maine Municipal Association. He published several studies on financing state and local government, the initiative and referendum in Maine, and the town manager plan. In 1950 he was executive secretary to Maine Governor Frederick G. Payne, and sat on a committee that modernized the state’s tax structure. From 1953 to 1954 he was associate director of the Citizenship Clearing House of the New York University School of Law. Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court Arthur T. Vanderbilt led a search committee to replace the President of Allegheny College. Vanderbilt was aware of Pelletier's contributions, and recommended him. Pelletier was installed in the post in 1955, and served until 1980, when declining health convinced him to retire. He and his wife moved to York Harbor, Maine, where he lived until his death (from cancer) in 1995. Honors and recognitions During Pelletier's tenure as president, enrollment at Allegheny College increased from approximately 1,000 to 1,850 and the size of the faculty increased from 78 to 130. Additionally, from 1959 to 1980 the college raised $1 million on average for capital purposes and its budget exceeded $13 million by 1980. Several buildings were built during his tenure, including a library (1976) that carries his name. Pelletier served as trustee for the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. He served on the convention that proposed changes to the constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (1968). He received honorary doctor of laws degrees from Bowdoin (1962), Colby College (1963), Gannon College (1975), Gannon University (1975), and Nasson College (1980).

A number of successes have been achieved, the foremost including sildenafil (Viagra) for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension and thalidomide for leprosy and multiple myeloma. Clinical trials have been performed on posaconazole and ravuconazole for Chagas disease. Other antifungal agents clotrimazole and ketoconazole have been investigated for anti-trypanosome therapy.Section 2.2.2. \\"Repositioning of Drugs\\" Drug repositioning is a \\"universal strategy\\" for neglected diseases due to 1) reduced number of required clinical trial steps could reduce the time and costs for the medicine to reach market, 2) existing pharmaceutical supply chains could facilitate \\"formulation and distribution\\" of the drug, 3) known possibility of combining with other drugs could allow more effective treatment, 4) the repositioning could facilitate the discovery of \\"new mechanisms of action for old drugs and new classes of medicines\\", 5) the removal of “activation barriers” of early research stages can enable the project to advance rapidly into disease-oriented research. Often considered as a serendipitous approach, where repurposable drugs are discovered by chance, drug repurposing has heavily benefited from advances in human genomics and network biology. It is now possible to identify serious repurposing candidates by finding genes involved in a specific disease and checking if they interact, in the cell, with other genes which are targets of known drugs. It was shown that drugs against targets supported by human genetics are twice as likely to succeed than overall drugs in the pharmaceutical pipeline. Drug repurposing can be a time and cost effective strategy for treating dreadful diseases such as cancer. However, there are also a number of downsides to drug repositioning. Firstly, the dosage required for the treatment of novel disease usually differs from that of its original target disease, and if this happens, the discovery team will have to begin from Phase I clinical trials, which effectively strips drug repositioning of its advantages of over de novo drug discovery. Secondly, the finding of new formulation and distribution mechanisms of existing drugs to the novel- disease-affected areas rarely includes the efforts of \\"pharmaceutical and toxicological\\" scientists. Thirdly, patent right issues can be very complicated for drug repurposing due to the lack of experts in the legal area of drug repositioning, the disclosure of repositioning online or via publications, and the extent of the novelty of the new drug purpose.

Noted typeface designers, among them Lucian Bernhard, Konrad Friedrich Bauer (not related to the company's founder), Walter Baum, Heinrich Jost, Imre Reiner, Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler, Emil Rudolf Weiß, and Heinrich Wienyck, designed typefaces for the company. The company nearly went bankrupt at the end of the 19th century because the company's administration assumed that type founding, rather than typesetting, would be automated. The new owner, Georg Hartmann, succeeded in saving the company. Subsequently, the company grew, also due to several takeovers, e.g. in 1916 by Frankfurt's type foundry Flinsch, itself a global player. In 1927, an office was opened in New York City. In 1972, all activities of the headquarters in Frankfurt were stopped and transferred to the former subsidiary company, Fundición Tipográfica Neufville in Barcelona, after 1995 to Bauer Types, SL, which still owns the rights to many typefaces.

He specializes in traditional Arabic music but is widely known for his innovative approach. In total he has released fourteen CDs and six DVDs, and he tours internationally performing and teaching. Karim Nagi has been an invited speaker and master class instructor at Brown University, Princeton University, Yale University, New York University, Boston University, and the University of California Los Angeles, among many others, including international institutions. He has been a featured ethnic dance artist at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and a featured music artist at the American Folk Festival in Bangor, ME, in 2004 and Lowell, MA, in 2005. In 2001 Karim Nagi started the program Arabiqa, aimed to educate children and adults alike on Arabic culture through music and arts rather than through religion and politics. He is a member of the New England Foundation for the Arts, through which he is a New England States Touring (NEST) artist. Under the name Turbo Tabla, Karim Nagi has released four CDs, two of which were distributed internationally by Universal Records. These CDs feature Karim's pioneering technique and unique aesthetic in mixing traditional Arabic sounds with Hip Hop, Techno and House. More recently, he has been exploring English language spoken word fused with his signature Arab percussion and electronic remixes. He produces the annual Arab Dance Seminar, now in its fourteenth session, where he invites native and expert instructors to teach dances and culture from around the Arab world over three days every November. He is also the director of the Sharq Ensemble, a group of three to thirteen Arab and American musicians that revives and performs traditional Arabic music. The Ensemble was featured, to wide acclaim, in the Boston Christmas Revels in 2011 and has also performed, toured and released one CD with the Boston Camerata. Biography Born in Kuwait, Karim Nagi lived in Egypt until his father received an offer to complete his residency in England. His family then moved to the United States, where his father worked as a radiologist. Music did not become a central point in Karim's life until he met composer Christopher Stowens, who encouraged him to play percussion instruments and taught him the basics of computer-driven electronic music. Karim studied philosophy and psychology at Skidmore College, where he was heavily involved in theatre sound production and played guitar and drums in multiple bands on the side. After his graduation, Karim traveled around India, Turkey, Eastern Europe and Egypt. At the end of his extended travels in 1995, Karim dedicated himself to the study and performance of Arabic music. He studied with Nabil Ata and Midhat al-Rashidi (who performed regularly with Abdel Halim Hafez), Simon Shaheen, Michel Baqlouq (Fairuz ensemble), Dr. Alfred Gamil (Cairo Conservatory of Music) and Mohammed Al- Araby (percussionist for Umm Kulthum and The National Orchestra of Egypt). He focused on Arabic percussion, including the Arabic Tabla (goblet drum), the Riq, and the Sagat (finger cymbals). During the 1990s, Karim was well known in Boston for his family's boutique on Newbury Street, his participation in fashion shows, and his skills as a DJ. However, after 9/11, Karim decided to educate people about his culture instead of hiding his identity. His Arabesque Mondays at Club Passim captured Boston's attention. These monthly gatherings aimed to \\"draw together people interested in traditional [Arabic] music... and educate those who may not be familiar with it.\\" He attracted Boston's attention and revived the Arab music scene in Boston Karim's educative mission then moved from the club scene to the classroom. He taught Arabic music at The New England Conservatory of Music for five years, and has since been invited to lecture and present at schools, colleges, universities, conservatories, museums, and events (such as SXSW) across the United States and internationally. In the course of his work, including frequent invitations to teach workshops for dance and music studios, he has traveled to and taught on every continent (except Antarctica), in more than 20 countries. Tradition re-imagined Karim Nagi has recorded four CDs under the moniker of Turbo Tabla: Arabic Music Re-Imagined (2003), Bellydance Overdrive (2004), The Belly and the Beat (2006), and Unregulated (2010). Two were released by The Miles Copeland Group (Sting, R.E.M., Hakim, Bellydance Superstars, Oojami) and are distributed internationally by Universal Records. All include tracks originally composed or arranged by Nagi. They exemplify Karim's principle \\"tradition re-imagined\\" - fusing traditional songs, rhythms and sounds from the Arab world with hip-hop, techno and house music. In 2012 Karim Nagi released two albums under \\"Karim Nagi,\\" which further developed his philosophy of innovation within tradition. In the first, \\"Arabized,\\" Karim tackles the concept of Westernization. He reworks recognizable songs from non-Arabic traditions (including American, Chinese, Mexican, Indian, and European), using Arabic instruments and rhythm, i.e. \\"Arabizing\\" them. He also makes his first extended foray into vocals on the original track \\"The Mash of Civilizations,\\" in which he samples several recognizable non-Arab tunes and themes, combines them with Arabic instruments and overlays his spoken word message about cultural collaboration. \\"Rhythmatiq,\\" the second album from 2012, showcases Karim's expertise in Arab rhythms. Utilizing samples, tabla, riq, sagat, hand- clapping, and even voice (at times reminiscent of bol (music)), he builds short songs entirely upon a single Arab rhythm or rhythmatic concept. The tracks incorporate cultural context audible to the trained ear and are meant to be mixed and matched, enabling listeners and performers to create their own drum solos. The album opens and closes with two of Karim Nagi's complete drum solos, featuring his signature energetic yet clean tabla technique and demonstrating his structured philosophy to drum solos. Furthermore, the CD packaging includes a chart of all the included rhythms and more, making the album a teaching tool as well. After the release of the album, Karim invited dancers from around the world (all students of his) to choreograph individual pieces. As a result of his innovative fusion of the traditional and modern, Karim Nagi's music appeals to and is utilized by a wide range of dance artists, from tribal fusion artists like Jill Parker to more traditional Raqs Sharqi artists, like Bozenka. In 2008 he was nominated for the Zaghareet Awards (for those involved in Middle Eastern dance and music in the United States) in the Category of Favorite Musician. Multi-dimensional performer Karim Nagi is widely known for his vibrant and energetic performances. He integrates his skills as musician, dancer and DJ to make his shows unique and exciting. His signature Turbo Tabla performances involve energetic dancing while playing the tabla, untraditionally strapped over his shoulder. His technique for the tabla strap developed in the context of teaching Dabka and is a well-kept secret. He is also well known for his ambidextrous approach to playing the Sagat and ability to accompany his own dancing with his musical skill on the instrument. * In addition, he will sometimes break the group tradition of Dabka by performing lively solos. Musician While a pioneer in modernizing Arab music, Karim Nagi is also a purist: \\"Old-Style tradition Arabic music still crushes my soul. It is my first love. It is the only style of music that consistently blisses me.\\" Although adept at multiple instruments, Karim Nagi's specialty is the Riq. He is sought after for his musicality and intuitive accompaniment skill on the riq, regularly being invited to perform with DC-based band Ana MasryAna Masry website and for the Jawaahir Dance Company in Minneapolis He is also the founder and director of the Sharq Ensemble. Their mission: To preserve and present traditional and classical Arabic vocal and instrumental music. The ensemble has performed at Harvard University, MIT, UC Santa Barbara, The Boston Center for the Arts, Brooklyn Museum of Art, among many others. In 2005, The Sharq Ensemble joined the Boston Camerata on the project A Mediterranean Christmas. They released an album and toured France and Germany. The repertoire is based on medieval musical cultures of southern Europe and northern Africa, between 1200-1900. The Sharq Ensemble formed an integral part of the Boston Christmas Revels in 2011, where they sold out their 2005 album REVIVAL: Wasla Hijazkar and Wasla Bayyati (still available electronically). Given his expertise in Arab rhythms, Karim Nagi has also released albums aimed at educating listeners about the traditional rhythms found in the Arab world. These CDs include Rhythms from Around the Arab World and Advanced Rhythms for the Advanced Dancer. He has also released instructional DVDs for both tabla and riq. Dancer Although primarily known as a musician, Karim Nagi has also trained in traditional Arab folk dances, specifically Dabka and Saidi Raqs al assaya (martial arts-based staff dance from Upper Egypt). He can frequently be seen performing the latter, dressed traditionally in a Galabeya and utilizing a pair of staves. He is widely sought after by dancers to teach Arab folk dances, as well as topics that integrate his knowledge of music and dance, e.g. Musicality for Dancers, Live Drum Solo, Arabic Maqam and Taqsim, and Survey of Arabic Music for Dance. Deeply invested in placing Arab dance in its cultural context, Karim began producing the Arab Dance Seminar in 2005. This three-day event immerses students in the language, music, social and political context of dances from different parts of the Arab world. The classes are taught by Karim Nagi and teachers whom he personally selects, including native Arabs and non-Arab ethnologists. The Arab Dance Seminar has sold out every year since its inception. He has also produced an instructional DVD on Arab Folk Dance, which includes lessons in Dabka, Saidi Raqs al assaya (based on Tahtib), Khaleeji, and Sufi ritual dance. Outreach to non-Arabs After 9/11 Karim Nagi became acutely aware of the need for cultural education that humanized and depoliticized Arabs and Arab culture. He created Arabiqa, a program he presents in schools around the country in order to bring Arabic music and arts closer to children. He has also presented his Arabiqa program for adults at conferences in Colleges, Universities, Conservatories, and Music events. In 2013 he produced a full-length theatre program based on Arabiqa, which he performed at the YMCA Theatre in Cambridge, MA. Karim Nagi explains the mission of Arabiqa: \\"Language and the arts define Arab and Islamic culture. By learning about these unifying themes, one can understand this culture with much more depth and authenticity...My agenda is to demonstrate the depth of Arab art as exemplified in music and dance... Arab culture, through the universal language of music, becomes demystified and humanized. The beauty and authenticity of Arabic music and dance serve as a convincing demonstration of the simultaneous exoticism and familiarity of this ancient culture\\". Outreach to the Arab diaspora With Club Passim in Cambridge, Karim Nagi began the work of connecting the Arab-American diaspora to each other as well as to their traditional culture. As a self-employed professional artist, he encourages Arabs to preserve and participate in the presentation of their traditions. In 2009 he was invited as a panelist at the Diwan conference at the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. His presentation, titled Lauren of Arabia addressed the prevalence of non-Arabs in Arab dance culture and encouraged members of the Arab diaspora to represent themselves in the arts.

History Logan is situated on the Gallatin River and was established in 1889 as a railroad station on the Northern Pacific and Montana (later the Northern Pacific Railway). (Logan is located on today's Montana Rail Link.) During construction period the settlement was referred to as Canyon House, due to a house of that name which was here at that time. The name of Logan was adopted on November 26, 1889. The name is in honor of Captain William Logan, who came to Montana in 1872, taking part in General Baker’s campaign against the Indians in 1872 to 1876. In 1877, Captain Logan accompanied General Gibbon on the expedition which resulted in the Battle of the Big Hole on August 9, 1877, where he met his death. His wife’s name as Miss Odelia Furlong. It is noted that [the] right-of-way of the Northern Pacific here was acquired from Odelia Logan. The owners of the town site were William D. Flowers and Mary E. Flowers. Their certificate is dated October 20, 1892. The plat was filed on June 10, 1893. Logan was an important junction on the Northern Pacific's Rocky Mountain Division, where westbound trains could diverge north to the line to Helena, Montana and Mullan Pass, or south to Butte, Montana, via Homestake Pass. In addition, the Northern Pacific operated a secondary freight-only line between Logan and Bozeman, Montana from the 1920s through the 1950s. This was eventually made redundant by the use of diesel locomotives such as the EMD FT on the Northern Pacific and the alternate route was subsequently removed. Until the 1930s Logan was home to a six-stall roundhouse, as well as coal and water facilities which supported the Northern Pacific's steam locomotives. The roundhouse burned down in a fire in December, 1932, destroying or damaging at least three steam locomotives. Photographs of this event can be seen in the Ronald V. Nixon Collection at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. The call letters for Logan's telegraph office were CH. It was located approximately 1,120 miles from the NP's terminus in St. Paul, Minnesota. Its elevation is 4,087 feet.

The competition was run on a regional basis, with separate northern and southern tournaments, with the winners of the two meeting in the final. Very few teams entered the competition, including only two from the southern South Island; Seacliff easily won the only match played there, thumping Oamaru 7-0, and repeated this in the final, accounting for Wellington's YMCA 4-0. Of the teams taking part, it is known that four were from Wellington; contemporary reports indicate that Diamonds, Hospital, YMCA, and Waterside took part.Papers Past — Evening Post — 4 August 1923 — SOCCER There is some suggestion that the Auckland regional winners, Northcote required a play-off against North Shore United to progress.
