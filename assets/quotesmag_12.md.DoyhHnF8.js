The cameras feature a pair of lenses (offset left-to-right by a baseline that approximates the distance between an average pair of human eyes), and an autostereoscopic display which directs pixels of the two offset images to the user's left and right eyes simultaneously. Methods are included for extending or contracting the stereoscopic baseline (the distance between the left and right images), albeit with an asynchronous timer or manually depressing the shutter twice. The dual-lens architecture also enables novel modes such as simultaneous near and far zoom capture of a 2D image. The remainder of the camera is similar to other compact digital cameras.  Marketplace  The W1 was the first digital stereo camera from a major manufacturer. The W1Fujifilm W1 web site was launched in July 2009, during an era in which 3D televisions and movies were becoming increasingly popular. Panasonic, Toshiba, Sony, and other manufacturers have announced their intention to release a number of 3D-capable devices. Although the W1 got some considerably unfavorable reviews and some photography experts predicted a commercial failure, the W1 seems to have sold far over Fujifilms expectations. Production of the camera ended in mid-2010 to introduce its successor, the W3 model.  Hardware  The W1 has two lenses, each capturing color images at 10-megapixel resolution and each capable of 3x optical zoom (35mm - 105mm in 35mm camera equivalent). The color LCD on the rear of the camera measures 2.8\\" diagonal, with 0.23 megapixels. It can be electronically switched between normal display and autostereoscopic display. The two lenses can also be used to take two simultaneous shots of the same scene with different settings (zoom, ISO, etc.). In August 2010, Fujifilm announced the W3, a new stereoscopic 3D compact point-and-shoot camera with the ability to capture 3D images and videos, the follow-up to the first-of-its-kind W1 with similar specs and design. The W3 features higher resolution (720p) and better nighttime performance as well as a better integrated autostereoscopic display. The image result is better than Panasonic's 3D add-on which uses two lenses, but feeds the offset image to a single sensor, so the resolution gets chopped in half, then stretched back to its full-width after the processor creates 3D effect.Fujifilm FinePix W3 - Unbiased digital camera reviews, prices, and advice  Initial adjustment  W3 with wrong vertical parallaxOne of the initial adjustment overlooked by many new users is the lenses vertical parallax, that must not be confused with the horizontal parallax (set manually by the left rocker button). Although the lenses should be perfectly aligned, by design, there is a small vertical axis error inherent for each camera body. This error implies that all pictures (and videos as well) taken with a wrong vertical parallax are harder to look at, because one eye is looking up while the other is looking down. To effectively correct this optical discrepancy, the camera offers a vertical parallax correction in its menu system: MENU/SET/OPT AXIS CONTROL. The best way to use this adjustment is to zoom at maximum, take a picture, then analyse it with a software stereoscopic player(using row or column interlaced view) to obtain the subject at the same vertical level.  File formats  Images are captured as pairs of still images, and are saved as Multi Picture Object (MPO) files, or an MPO file plus a JPEG file. This MPO file is basically two JPEG files joined together, but the MPO format can contain more than just two pictures. The camera can also capture video sequences, for which it uses \\"3D-AVI\\". The MPO file format is a new file format which, though not proprietary, is not yet widely supported. It is supported by the free software image viewer Geeqie, as well as the freeware stereo photo-editing program Stereo Photo Maker (Windows), the free photo management program Daminion (Windows), the commercial program STOIK Imagic (Windows) and the shareware programs Stereomerger (Windows and Macintosh), Anaglyph Workshop (Windows and Macintosh) and MPO3DViewer (Macintosh). GoPro Cineform's Neo3D also now supports the Fuji video format. Neo3D converts clips into various formats including anaglyph and the \\"half side-by-side\\" required by YouTube and 3D TVs. The clips can then be joined etc. by most video editors and viewed on various stereo displays. Neo3D can be trialled for 15 days.Contact GoPro Cineform  Model W3  Encouraged by the reception of the W1, Fuji released a new model, the W3, in September 2010. The W3 has a slightly smaller stereo base and the left lens is slightly further from the left edge of the camera, thus partially addressing two common complaints about the design of the W1. The W3 is also smaller and lighter and uses the smaller and lighter NP50 battery rather than the NP95 battery used by the W1. The user interface is much easier to use with a ring selector similar to other compact digital cameras. The zoom control is in the form of a ring surrounding the shutter button, with the parallax control now in the form of a slider on top of the camera. 2D/3D selection is through a single button, as is the video mode. A single button also selects play mode, for viewing pictures and videos. This can turn the camera on and off without the need to open and close the front lens cover. The sliding lens cover is similar to the W1 cover but is enhanced by a projection that makes opening and closing it easier. The auto stereoscopic display has 3 times the resolution and is larger, with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It is also somewhat brighter. Both still and video modes default to 16:9, but the same 4:3 sensors are used as in the W1 so in 16:9 mode is actually 7.2 megapixels (3584x2016) vs 10 megapixels (3648x2736) in 4:3 mode. Video mode now defaults to 720p (1280x720 @24 frame/s) but can also do 640x480@30 frame/s and 320x240@30 frame/s.Fuji W3 Owner's manual pp 103-106 Fuji reports that sales of the W3 have been going well, with 100,000 units selling in 2010 and 500,000 expected by September 2011.Live from the CP +: First day in Asia's largest photography fair While this pales compared to other compact digital cameras, it will surpass the sales of the Stereo Realist and will probably make it the best selling stereo camera to date. The improvements in the design as well as the lower price, US$499 suggested retail with street prices typically US$300‚Äì$350, along with the wider distribution channel have certainly helped sales.  Samples  One of the criticisms of the Fuji W1 is the wide interocular spacing (77 mm) which would normally make closeups such as this cake unviewable. However, it is possible by backing off from the subject and using the 3X optical zoom to compensate for the wide interocular and take some decent closeup stereo shots. 500px 500px Image from W1, converted to JPG for uploading 3D in outer space In December 2010 via the Russian spacecraft Soyuz on the mission Soyuz TMA-20, a European Space Agency astronaut brought the Fujifilm FinePix REAL 3D W1 aboard the International Space Station.

Publication history The series, written by Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi, was published twice a month for 24 issues (25 if including issue #0) alternating with Justice League: Generation Lost written by Keith Giffen and Judd Winick. Johns has discussed the general theme: Brightest Day also crossed over into the Green Lantern series, the Green Lantern Corps, Justice League of America, The Titans and The Flash. Gail Simone returned to a new volume of the Birds of Prey comic book, which also went under the same banner. Other tie-ins included the first issues of a relaunched Green Arrow and the Justice Society of America. Jeff Lemire wrote the one-shot Brightest Day: The Atom Special with artist Mahmud Asrar, which acted as a springboard for an Atom story to co- feature in Adventure Comics with the same creative team. The Green Lantern series featured more of the characters Atrocitus, Larfleeze, Saint Walker, and Indigo-1 in a story arc titled \\"New Guardians\\". At Emerald City Comic-Con 2010, Johns also stated that Firestorm would be a \\"main character\\" in Brightest Day. The first issue, issue #0, was penciled by Fernando Pasarin. David Finch, a newly DC exclusive artist, illustrated the covers for the entire series. \\"Brightest Day\\" event was also used to introduce Jackson Hyde, the new Aqualad created for the Young Justice animated series, into the DC Universe. Similarly, the final issue of the series reintroduced the Swamp Thing and John Constantine into the mainstream DC Universe after a number of years in DC's mature Vertigo imprint. Summary The story begins the day after Blackest Night showing Boston smashing his tombstone. Nearby, a baby bird falls out of its nest and dies, but is resurrected by the white ring that Boston has on. The ring then takes him to everyone that was resurrected and he (while being invisible) sees how they are celebrating their new leases on life. Boston then asks the ring why it is showing him this; its answer was - it needs help. It then takes him to the destroyed Star City and creates a forest. Meanwhile, in New Mexico, Sinestro discovers a White Lantern battery. Hal and Carol arrive and try to lift the lantern, but it will not move... Boston brand (white lantern) fights the Anti- monitor and damages the anti- monitors chest plate then the anti-monitor blasts Boston Brand.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is still in use today, now known as Eccleston C-of-E Primary School. History The school was built in 1878 for the 1st Duke of Westminster and designed by the Chester architect John Douglas. It continues to be in use as a Church of England primary school. Architecture The architectural style is described by Douglas' biographer, Edward Hubbard, as being Gothic, although in the citation in The National Heritage List for England it is described as being as Tudor. It is constructed in red sandstone with a red tile roof and its plan is a 'T'-shape. The school is attached to the former schoolmaster's house, also designed by Douglas, and also a Grade II* listed building. Attached to the other end of the school is an octagonal turret with a belfry and a steeple. The gables have stone coping and shaped finials. At the apex of the front gable is a niche containing the statue of a figure wearing a crown, teaching a child. The windows are mullioned; some of them are arched, while others are straight-headed. There are two arched doorways; the doors have elaborate wrought iron hinges. Critique Douglas designed schools for other estate villages, including Aldford, Dodleston and Waverton. Like Eccleston School, Waverton School is built in close proximity to the schoolmaster's house. In each case the buildings are contrasted, the house being partly half-timbered while the school is constructed entirely in stone. Hubbard considers that these two schools \\"are outstanding among Douglas' village schools, and though both are attractive, Eccleston is the more delightful of the two\\". Similarly the authors of the Buildings of England series express the opinion that Eccleston is the best of Douglas' estate schools.

The combined structure is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The school and the house were built in 1877 for the 1st Duke of Westminster and designed by the Chester architect John Douglas. The schoolmaster's house is still in use as a house, while the school is now a day nursery and after school club. Architecture=School This is constructed in red ashlar sandstone with a red tile roof. It is in one storey and its south front has five bays. Each of the central three bays has four-light mullioned and transomed window under a stone-coped gable with a finial. In the left bay is an arched doorway and in the right bay is a four-light mullioned window. The roof is hipped and contains three gabled ventilators. At the left end of the roof is a bellcote. House The house is connected to the school by a single-storey passage. It has two storeys; the lower storey is constructed in orange brick on a stone plinth, and the upper storey is timber-framed. The roof is in red tiles and there are two chimneys. The main (west) front of the house has three bays. The doorway is in the central bay; over this is an oriel window supported by wooden columns under a gable. To the left of the door is a five-light mullioned window. A pair of small outbuildings with hipped roofs are attached to the left side of the house. The south aspect of the house has a canted window in the lower storey under a jettied timber-framed upper storey supported on wooden brackets. The upper storey contains a four-light casement window with a date inscribed in the beam above it. Critique Douglas designed schools for other estate villages, including Aldford, Dodleston and Eccleston. Like Eccleston school, Waverton school is built in close proximity to the schoolmaster's house. In each case the buildings are contrasted, the house being partly half-timbered while the school is constructed entirely in stone. Douglas' biographer Edward Hubbard considers that these two schools \\"are outstanding among Douglas' village schools\\".

The winding pattern is used for radio- frequency electronic components with many parallel wires, such as inductors and transformers. The winding pattern reduces the amount of wire running in adjacent, parallel turns. The wires in successive layers of a basket wound coil cross each other at large angles, as close to 90 degrees as possible, which reduces energy loss due to electrical cross-coupling between wires at radio frequencies. Purpose The basket winding method is used for coils designed for use at frequencies of 50 kHz and higher to reduce two undesirable side effects, proximity effect and parasitic capacitance, that arise in long parallel segments of current-carrying wire. The proximity effect is caused in a wire by the magnetic field from current flowing in nearby parallel wires, such as other loops in the same coil. If two adjacent wires carry a current in the same direction, then the effect is felt in both ‚Äì the magnetic field of the nearby wires causes current in each wire to be concentrated in a small region on the wire‚Äôs surface farthest from the adjacent wires. The concentration of current along a small portion of the conductor increases the wire‚Äôs resistance and hence increases energy loss. At medium and high radio frequencies the increased resistance of the inductor can increase the bandwidth of tuned circuits and reduce the circuit‚Äôs frequency selectivity, or Q factor. Parasitic capacitance is the consequence of parallel turns of wire acting as capacitor plates, storing charge between adjacent wires. The parasitic capacitance can cause the coil to become self-resonant at one or several frequencies, which interferes with the intended tuned resonance and blocks and reflects current at the self-resonant frequency. Unfortunately basket-weave coil winding increases the physical size of the coil, which increases leakage inductance. Methods Basket windings are often wound with Litz wire, a thin, multi-strand wire with each strand individually insulated, which further reduces losses. Cotton or fabric insulation is important from a mechanical point of view during the winding process, because a common enameled magnet wire does not provide sufficient surface friction between coil layers to hold the turns at large angles.http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/winders/wave/index.html Crystal radio with basket-wound coil See also * Ayrton-Perry winding * Bifilar winding * Inductor  External links  * Photo and description of basket winding  References  Category:Electromagnetic coils ","title":"Basket winding"},{"id":"25769681","title":"What's a Memory Like You (Doing in a Love Like This)"},{"id":"25769709","text":"Esteban Gonz√°lez (born 22 May 1982) is a Chilean football midfielder who currently plays for O'Higgins in the Primera Divisi√≥n de Chile.

The bridge was owned by the Clifton family until Nottingham City Council took over responsibility for it in 1969. The piers have the Clifton arms on the inward facing walls. After a structural assessment revealed that the bridge was in a poor condition, it was closed to traffic in 1974. The centre span was demolished and replaced by a narrower footbridge, of steel girders with an in-situ reinforced concrete deck slab, in 1980. The bridge was then used as a footpath and cycleway, with a gas main and cable services under the deck. During 2014 & 2015 the bridge was enlarged as part of the works to construct Phase 2 of the Nottingham Express Transit system.

She is a retired American sociologist and university administrator and previously served as the President of the University of Virginia from August 1, 2010 until July 31, 2018. Early life Sullivan was born on July 9, 1949. In 1970, she received her undergraduate degree from Michigan State University's James Madison College, where she was asked to stay on as an intern in the office of the president by Clifton R. Wharton Jr., then the president. She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1975. Career She joined the faculty of the University of Texas as an instructor in sociology. At Texas, she held a variety of academic and administrative posts, including the chair of the sociology department, vice provost, and vice president and dean of graduate studies. She then served as the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University of Michigan. Sullivan has written or cowritten six books and over 80 scholarly articles in sociology. In 1978, Sullivan authored Marginal Workers, Marginal Jobs: The Underutilization of American of Workers. In 1983, Sullivan co-authored The Dilemma of American Immigration: Beyond the Golden Door with Pastora San Juan Cafferty, Barry R. Chiswick and Andrew M. Greeley. In 1990, she co-authored The Social Organization of Work with Randy Hodson, which was described as a \\"pathbreaking textbook in the sociology of work\\" by Daniel B. Cornfield. In 2020, Sullivan published Census 2020: Understanding the Issues, a textbook that covers the historical, logistical, and legal aspects of the United States Census. She is an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Early in her career, Sullivan published on the labor force and immigration in the United States. This included \\"Labor Force Composition and Unemployment Trends,\\" (Clifford C. Clogg and Sullivan), \\"The Occupational Prestige of Women Immigrants,\\" \\"Documenting Immigration,\\" \\"Measuring Underemployment and Inequality in the Work Force\\" (Clogg, Sullivan, and Jan E. Mutchler), \\"Estimating Labor Absorption with Published Data,\\" and \\"Women Minority Workers in the New Economy: Optimistic, Pessimistic, and Mixed Scenarios .\\" Throughout the 1990s and the 2000s, Sullivan continued to publish on immigration as well as issues undertaken by universities to diversify their campuses‚Äîincluding the Texas Top 10 Percent law. Among Sullivan's publications during this period are: \\"Student Feelings of Connection to the Campus and Openness to Diversity and Challenge at a Large Research University: Evidence of Progress?\\" (Jessica J. Summers, Marilla D. Svinicki, Joanna S. Gorin, and Sullivan), \\"Minority College Aspirations, Expectations and Applications under the Texas Top 10% Law\\" (Kim M. Lloyd, Kevin T. Leicht, and Sullivan), \\"Minority Talent Loss and the Texas Top 10 Percent Law\\" (Sunny Xinchun Niu, Sullivan, and Marta Tienda), and \\"The Promise and the Peril of the Texas Uniform Admission Law\\" (with Marta Tienda).  Consumer Bankruptcy Study  In the 1980s, Sullivan worked with legal scholars Elizabeth Warren and Jay Lawrence Westbrook on what could become Phase I of the Consumer Bankruptcy Project, which, at its time, was the largest study of consumer bankruptcy in the United States. The findings of Phase 1 of this project culminated in several academic articles, including \\"Limiting Access to Bankruptcy Discharge: An Analysis of Creditors' Data,\\" \\"Folklore and Facts: A Preliminary Report from the Consumer Bankruptcy Project,\\" \\"The Use of Empirical Data in Formulating Bankruptcy Policy,\\" and \\"Laws, Models, and Real People: Choice of Chapter in Personal Bankruptcy.\\" In 1989, Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook published the book-length study, As We Forgive Our Debtors: Bankruptcy and Consumer Credit in America, which was described as setting \\"an example for legal scholarship which has rarely been, and will rarely be, met,\\" by Michael J. Herbert. This book was given the Silver Gavel Award in 1990 by the American Bar Association and was a finalist for the American Sociological Association‚Äôs Distinguished Scholarly Contribution competition. The authors were also invited to give testimony before congressional committees, state legislatures, and the National Commission on Bankruptcy Reform to explain the findings of their study and what their study uncovered about the American consumer bankruptcy system, its strengths, and its weaknesses. Phase II of the Consumer Bankruptcy Study centered on the use of the bankruptcy system by middle-class Americans. Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook published several academic articles on their findings including, \\"Consumer Credit Ten Years Later: A Financial Comparison of Consumer Bankrupts 1981-1991\\" and \\"Consumer Bankruptcy in the United States: A Study of Alleged Abuse and of Local Legal Culture: Journal of Consumer Policy.\\" Sullivan also published \\"Methodological Realities: Social Science Methods and Business Reorganizations.\\" The authors published their book-length study, The Fragile Middle Class: Americans in Debt in 1999, which was described by Andrew Greeley as \\"a well-designed and carefully executed study.\\" Phase III of the Consumer Bankruptcy Study studied the growing numbers of women and older Americans filing for bankruptcy. Several academic articles were published on Phase III findings including, \\"Rethinking The Debates Over Health Care Financing: Evidence from the Bankruptcy Courts\\" (Melissa B. Jacoby, Sullivan, and Warren), Sullivan's \\"Gender Differences in Accounts of Bankruptcy,\\" Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook's \\"Less Stigma or More Financial Distress: An Empirical Analysis of the Extraordinary Increase in Bankruptcy Filings,\\" \\"The Increasing Vulnerability of Older Americans\\" (Deborah Thorne, Sullivan, and Warren), and Sullivan's \\"Debt and Simulation of Social Class.\\" Presidency of the University of Virginia Sullivan was unanimously elected on January 11, 2010, and became the University's first female president on August 1, 2010. However, on June 10, 2012, it was announced to the University that Sullivan would step down from her position on August 15, 2012, after serving only two years of a five-year contract. Leaders of the university‚Äôs governing board decided to remove Sullivan, \\"largely because of her unwillingness to consider dramatic program cuts in the face of dwindling resources and for her perceived reluctance to approach the school with the bottom-line mentality of a corporate chief executive\\".Daniel de Vise and Anita Kumar, \\"U-Va. Faculty Senate to meet in emergency session Sunday over Teresa Sullivan‚Äôs ouster\\", Washington Post, June 17, 2012 Counterpunch presented the dispute as being more about differing views of the academic culture and future direction of the university than immediate financial concerns; whether less popular traditional-classical academic studies should be cut, with funding refocused on more profitable and business-oriented courses and programs.Surin, Kenneth. Virginia Politicians and the Slow Strangulation of Its Famous State University (January 2, 2017), CounterPunch Later news reports presented the resignation as an \\"ouster\\" organized by Helen Dragas, rector of the university's Board of Visitors; with strong suggestions of Dragas' conflicting views of the future of the university, and personal ambitions playing a role in her actions. Although a formal meeting and vote of the full board was not held at the time, Sullivan was presented with the news of her loss of majority support within the board, and given the 'opportunity' to resign. The public announcement of her resignation was communicated via an email by Dragas on behalf of the Board of Visitors. The message quoted from Sullivan's resignation letter and cited \\"philosophical differences\\" on how the University was to be run. Large-scale protest against the action, and support for Sullivan from students, faculty, alumni, as well as the national academic community, resulted, including a faculty senate demand for the removal of the Board of Visitors leaders ‚Äì Rector Helen Dragas and Vice Rector Mark J. Kington ‚Äì and demands from the student government for an explanation for the ouster. In the face of this pressure, including a statement from Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell that he would remove the entire board if they failed to resolve the issue at their June 26 meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president. Shortly after the 2014 publication of the Rolling Stone magazine article \\"A Rape on Campus\\", which documented an alleged gang rape by one of the University's fraternities, Sullivan suspended all Greek organizations until January 9, 2015. In January 2015 Sullivan acknowledged that the magazine's reporting had been \\"discredited\\": the story's author failed to interview numerous alleged witnesses named in the source's account, in addition to other inconsistencies. Sullivan said, \\"Before the Rolling Stone story was discredited, it seemed to resonate with some people simply because it confirmed their darkest suspicions about universities‚Äîthat administrations are corrupt; that today's students are reckless and irresponsible; that fraternities are hot-beds of deviant behavior.\\" https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/UVa-President-School-to-Be-National- Leader-on-Campus-Safety-290399841.html In January 2017, Sullivan announced her intention to retire effective September 30, 2018.

As chair of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Health Committee Wodarg co-signed a proposed resolution on 18 December 2009, which was briefly discussed in January 2010 in an emergency debate and he has called for an inquiry into alleged undue influence exerted by pharmaceutical companies on the World Health Organization‚Äôs global H1N1 flu campaign. Education and profession Born and raised in the town Itzehoe in Schleswig- Holstein, in 1966 Wodarg went, after his secondary school exams, on to study in medicine in Berlin and Hamburg. He got his physician's licence in 1973, and in 1974 he received his Dr. Med. doctorate degree from the University of Hamburg with a dissertation on the Mental Diseases of Seafarers ‚Äì a study of suicide, alcoholism and other major psychiatric disorders. He subsequently began work as a ship's doctor, and following a research trip to South Africa he began in the position of port doctor in Hamburg. Since 1983 he has held the position of Amtsarzt at the health department of Flensburg, of which he became director in the same decade. Wolfgang Wodarg is a lecturer at the University of Flensburg. Party affiliation Wodarg has been a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 1988. From 1992 to 2002 he was the head of the SPD's Schleswig-Flensburg district. From 19 November 2005 to 1 December 2007 Wodarg was chairman of the SPD district of Flensburg. Since 1990 Wodarg has been member of the executive committee of the national Association of Social Democrats in the Health Sector, and since 1994 the federal deputy chairman, and in 2002 he became elected chairman of the federal Committee. Member of parliament From 1986 to 1998 Wodarg belonged to the parish council of his native Nieby. From 1994 to 2009 he has been a member of the Bundestag. Here Wodarg was spokesman from 2003 to 2005 of the SPD caucus in the inquiry commission ethics and law of modern medicine and spokesman for issues of minorities in the German-Danish border area. He was a representative for the directly elected Bundestag seat for the Flensburg-Schleswig constituency from 1994 but lost his mandate in the 2009 German federal election. Since 1999 Wodarg has also belonged to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Since 2002 he has been vice chairman of the Socialist Group, and since 2006 president of the German social democrats and deputy head of the German delegation. COVID-19 pandemic Wodarg gained notoriety during public discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic when he argued that SARS-CoV-2 was only one of many similar viruses which usually go undetected as part of an ordinary seasonal period of respiratory infections, and that the worldwide activities to stop the pandemic were \\"hype\\" caused by the selective perception of researchers.Bayerischer Rundfunk, , 18 March 2020 His comments on the COVID-19 pandemic drew criticism from German scientists and some German media outlets. According to the critics, Wodarg's claims largely contradicted the verifiable facts; some of his statements were neither verifiable nor falsifiable; and because the facts Wodarg presented had nothing to do with each other, his statements had proved to be misleading.Veronika Simon: Wird Corona √ºbersch√§tzt?

Controversies  Wodarg first came to the attention of the general public in the 1980s when he was head of the Public Health Department (German: Gesundheitsamt) in Flensburg, Germany, and as such was (technically) responsible for employing as a doctor the medical impostor Gert Postel, later famously revealed to be a postman by training.Nike Heinen: Warum dieser Mann die Epidemie kleinredet. In: Welt.de, 19 March 2020. Transparency International Germany, on whose board of directors Wodarg serves, distanced itself from his statements on 17 March 2020: \\"Transparency International Germany rejects the sweeping criticism of board member Dr Wolfgang Wodarg of the government measures to protect the population from the coronavirus. (...) Wolfgang Wodarg is speaking on this matter as a private individual and not in his capacity as a member of the Management Board.\\"In eigener Sache: Zu den aktuellen √Ñu√üerungen von Wolfgang Wodarg. In: Transparency Deutschland, 17 March 2020. On 25 March 2020, the board decided to suspend his membership in the association \\"until further notice\\", which means that Wodarg can no longer exercise any functions on the board or as head of the health working group for the time being. The Board of Directors will commission an independent committee to look into Wodarg's statements about the coronavirus and to determine whether his behaviour has harmed the interests of Transparency International Germany. Transparency Chairman Hartmut B√§umer said that the reason for this was that Wodarg had expressed his views on \\"radical media\\" such as KenFM, Rubikon, Geolitico, and in an interview with Eva Herman; all of whom, in his opinion, \\"regularly work with conspiracy theories, with anti-democratic and sometimes anti-Semitic prejudices\\" and \\"oppose the basic democratic principles of Transparency\\"; while \\"some of them are personally close to the AfD\\".Hartmut B√§umer: Ruhen der Mitgliedschaft von Wolfgang Wodarg.

He had several temporary appointments before becoming a professor of history at the University of North Carolina in 1935. His most famous student was C. Vann Woodward, who adopted the Beard-Beale approach to Reconstruction. He went to the University of Wisconsin in 1948, where he directed many dissertations. He specialized in nineteenth and twentieth- century American history, particularly the Reconstruction Era, and the foreign policy of the early 20th century. He was a noted civil libertarian and advocate for academic freedom.Paul M. Buhle and Edward Rice-Maxim, William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire (New York: Routledge, 1995): 39; Michael Fellman, Views from the Dark Side of American History (LSU Press, 2011): 20. Biography Beale was born in Chicago to Frank A. and Nellie Kennedy Beale.Biography at Book Rags In 1921 he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a PhB in English from the University of Chicago. Beale received an M.A. and PhD from Harvard University. Reconstruction In his PhD dissertation, finished in 1924 under the direction of Edward Channing, Beale developed a complex new interpretation of Reconstruction. The dominant interpretation for the previous two decades was that of the Dunning School, which held that unscrupulous Northern adventurers, known as Carpetbaggers, manipulated the new black vote in the South to take control of state governments for their own advantage in terms of speculation, and corruption. The Freedmen (freed slaves) were merely pawns in the hands of the Carpetbaggers. Beale argued that the Carpetbaggers themselves were pawns in the hands of northern industrialists, who were the real villains of Reconstruction. These industrialists had taken control of the nation during the Civil War, and set up high tariffs to protect their profits, as well as a lucrative national banking system and a railroad network fueled by government subsidies and secret payoffs. The return to power of the southern whites would seriously threaten all their gains, and so the ex-Confederates had to be kept out of power. The tool used by the industrialists was the combination of the Northern Republican Party and sufficient Southern support using Carpetbaggers and black voters. The rhetoric of civil rights for blacks, and the dream of equality, was rhetoric designed to fool idealistic voters. Beale called it \\"claptrap.\\" In his chapter, \\"Claptrap and Issues,\\" Beale argued, \\"Constitutional discussions of the rights of the negro, the status of Southern states, the legal position of ex-rebels, and the powers of Congress and the president determined nothing. They were pure sham.\\"Beale, The Critical Year, p 147 President Andrew Johnson had tried, and failed, to stop the juggernaut of the industrialists. The Dunning school had praised Johnson for upholding the rights of the white men in the South and endorsing white supremacy. Beale was not a racist, and indeed was one of the most vigorous historians working for black civil rights in the 1930s and 1940s. In his view, Johnson was not a hero for his racism, but rather for his forlorn battle against the industrialists. Beale did not publish his dissertation until 1930, when The Critical Year appeared to widespread scholarly acclaim. However Charles A. Beard and Mary Beard had already published The Rise of American Civilization which in much abbreviated form had developed a similar theme. Instead of feeling upstaged by the Beards, Beale became friends with them and vigorously promoted their general interpretation of American history. The Beard-Beale interpretation of Reconstruction became known as \\"revisionism,\\" and replaced the Dunning school for most historians, until the 1950s.Allan D. Charles, \\"Howard K Beale,\\" in Clyde N. Wilson, ed. Twentieth-century American Historians (Gale Research Company, 1983) pp 32-38T. Harry Williams, \\"An Analysis of Some Reconstruction Attitudes,\\" Journal of Southern History (1946) 12#4 pp: 469-486 in JSTOR The Beard-Beale interpretation of the monolithic Northern industrialists fell apart in the 1950s when it was closely examined by numerous historians, including Robert P. Sharkey, Irwin Unger, and Stanley Coben. They conclusively demonstrated that there was no unified economic policy on the part of the dominant Republican Party, and there was no conspiracy to use Reconstruction to impose any such unified economic policy on the nation. Furthermore, the rhetoric on behalf of the rights of the Freedman was not claptrap but deeply held and very serious political philosophy.Kenneth M. Stampp and Leon F. Litwack, eds., Reconstruction: An Anthology of Revisionist Writings (1969) p 85-106 Foreign policy and editing Beale turned his attention to foreign-policy during the 1940s and published his major study of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy (the Shaw Lectures on Diplomatic History delivered at the Johns Hopkins University). Beale, like Beard, felt both world wars were mistakes for the United States, and strongly disagreed with the interventionism and imperialism of Theodore Roosevelt. However, in writing the 600 page monograph he changed his mind, deciding that Roosevelt had a remarkably deep comprehension of world affairs, and practiced very careful, very successful diplomacy. Beale did complain that Roosevelt was too ambiguous regarding race, and too friendly toward Britain and Japan.Charles, p 37 Beale was an active scholarly editor. He edited the diaries of Edward Bates (Attorney General) and Gideon Welles (Secretary of the Navy), who were members of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet. He edited a notable memorial work of essays by leading historians in honor of Charles A. Beard. Beale was an influence on the young William Appleman Williams at the University of Wisconsin.Paul M. Buhle and Edward Rice-Maxim, William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire (New York: Routledge, 1995): 39. In 1950 Beale spoke out against the call by Conyers Read, President of the American Historical Association, for historians to be enlisted in the ideological struggle against totalitarianism.Ian R.

Players are ranked based on how well they will translate to the professional game in the National Hockey League. It was founded by hockey executive Jack Button in 1975 to establish a centralized database of NHL prospects. Button served as the director until 1979. Its current director is Dan Marr. The Department consists of staff at the NHL Offices in Toronto, along with eight full-time scouts, and fifteen part-time scouts throughout North America. To report on prospects playing in Europe, the NHL employs the services of G√∂ran Stubb and his staff of six scouts at European Scouting Services based in Finland. All twenty-nine scouts reporting for Central Scouting will combine to see approximately 3000 games each year. Rankings procedure The full-time staff of the Central Scouting Service follows a checklist to assess the prospects' skillset and how it would apply to the pro game. Prospects are rated by skill as Excellent (E), Very Good (VG), Good (G), Average (A), Poor (P), or Not Applicable (NA), with different skills being emphasized amongst the different positions: forward, defenceman, and goaltender. The Service releases the contents of the checklists to the public from their website, so anyone can evaluate players at any level of play. The rankings are compiled by numerous reviews by the professional scouts' combined opinions of the players and released as a bimonthly list. Eligible players for the upcoming draft are ranked as North American Skaters, North American Goalies, European Skaters, or European Goalies. The players fit under the North American or International player based on where they train. For example, the Czech forward, Jakub Voracek was ranked as a North American prospect, because he played with the Halifax Mooseheads in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. A more recent example is American center Auston Matthews who was first on the European ranks, as he played for the ZSC Lions of the NLA. There are multiple times that the rankings come out during a year. Notably, the midterm rankings come out after the IIHF World Junior Championships and performance in the tournament greatly elevates draft status. In early April, after all junior and European seasons are completed, the final rankings are released. Directors * Jack Button: 1975‚Äì1979 * Jim Gregory: 1979‚Äì1992 * Frank Bonello: 1992‚Äì2005 * E.

His most famous work is the iconic cover design of the Strand Magazine, launched in 1891, which helped popularise the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. Hait√© was also a founder member and the first president of the London Sketch Club. Life and Art George Charles Hait√© was born in Bexleyheath, Kent, on 8 June 1855, the second child and eldest son of George Hait√© senior. His ancestors were French Huguenot immigrants, an awareness of which seems to have informed his later catchphrase that \\"art holds no nationality\\".Cuppleditch, David, The London Sketch Club, Alan Sutton Publishing, 1994, p. 25. His great grandfather, William Hait√©, and his grandfather, Henry Hait√©, worked in the calico printing industry centred on the River Cray in Kent. Henry's brother, John, was also a textile designer, samples of whose \\"Spring Fashions for 1813\\" are to be found in the archives of the Victoria and Albert Museum. His father, George Hait√© (1825‚Äì1871), was a prominent early Victorian cashmere shawl designer, albeit sadly so disillusioned with being a \\"slave of the fashion of the hour\\"Young, Hilary, Designs For Shawls. Webb & Bower, 1988, p. 12. that he actively discouraged his son from following him into the same profession. Ironically, it was his father's premature death of smallpox aged 45 that propelled G.C. to do just that when he found himself head of the household at the age of 16. Hait√© would later comment in his own Who's Who entry that he was \\"absolutely self-taught\\" in art. After moving to London in the early 1870s he began making a name for himself as a wallpaper and carpet designer, later working in metal, tapestry and stained glass. In 1883 he exhibited the first of many paintings at the Royal Academy. Hait√© worked in both oils and watercolours, specialising in landscapes with many executed on his travels to Venice, Morocco and Northern Europe. In 1897 his street scene of Dortmund won the Gold landscape prize at that year's Crystal Palace exhibition. He would usually sign his work \\"Geo C. Hait√©\\" or \\"G.C. Hait√©\\". Cliffs (1900), watercolour by G. C. Hait√© According to his friend, the great war correspondent Frederic Villiers: \\"I never met a man who was so rapid with brush and colours in transferring an impression to his canvas. His memory is so marvellously correct that one may watch him produce, within an hour or so, a sketch of a Dutch market-place with its greyness of atmosphere, a street in Bruges with the architectural beauty of its cathedral and houses, or a suburb in Tangier with its mosques and minarets glowing in the heat against a deep purple sky, as accurate in tone and drawing as if he had been seated in front of his subject.\\"Villiers, Frederic, Peaceful Personalities and Warriors Bold. Harper & Brothers, 1907, p. 28. As Villiers also commented, Hait√© was \\"one of the busiest men of his own little stage, for he is a president or fellow of some eight or nine art societies.\\" Indeed, his talents would earn him membership of numerous art societies including the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours, the Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, the Society of Miniature Painters, the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists, the National Association of House Painters and Decorators of England and Wales and, as president, the Institute of Decorative Designers.Who Was Who 1916‚Äì1928; 1992 reprint: . A & C Black. Hait√© also wrote and lectured on art and design and in 1897 was elected president of the Nicolson Institute art gallery in Staffordshire. His inexhaustible social activities even stretched beyond the visual arts, also involved in the famous literary club the Sette of Odd Volumes (see below), one of the earliest members of the Japan Society of London and, from 1888, a Fellow of the Linnean Society. Illustration work and The Strand magazine The Strand annual 1894 In 1886, Hait√© published Plant Studies for Artists, Designers and Art Students. Though it would be the only book solely written and illustrated by Hait√©, he edited and contributed drawings to numerous others including naturalist Edward Tickner Edwardes' Side-Lights of Nature in Quill and Crayon and In The Green Leaf and the Sere by the pseudonymous ornithologist \\"A Son of the Marshes\\".Jordan, Denham. In The Green Leaf and the Sere, London: Tr√ºbner & Co., 1896. In late 1890 he was asked by editor George Newnes to provide the cover pen and ink illustration for his new magazine The Strand, launched in January 1891. As sales of the magazine took off with the first of its Sherlock Holmes stories, beginning with A Scandal in Bohemia in the July 1891 issue, Hait√©'s graphic rendering of London's Strand looking eastwards with the magazine title suspended from telegraph wires was destined to become an icon of late-Victorian publishing. Variations of Hait√©'s design were featured on its sister title, The Strand Musical Magazine, and on several Sherlock Holmes first edition bound volumes. The Sette of Odd Volumes and Oscar Wilde In 1883, Hait√© was elected a member of the elite literary club the Sette of Odd Volumes.Villiers, Frederic, Peaceful Personalities and Warriors Bold. Harper & Brothers, 1907, p 29. He became its annual vice-president in 1887 and president ‚Äì known as \\"Oddship\\" ‚Äì from 1891‚Äì92. Since the Sette addressed its members under individual titles pertaining to their interests or profession, Hait√© was referred to as \\"The Art-Critic\\". As president he fashioned his own medal shaped like a painter's palette and staged a then-novel \\"Phonograph Evening\\" where the members recorded their voices onto an Edison wax Phonograph cylinder. Even more revolutionary for the club, it was under Hait√©'s presidency that the Sette broke with male-dominated tradition by staging its first mixed \\"Ladies Evening\\".The Year Boke of the Odd Volumes: An Annual Record of the Transactions of the Sette. Fourteenth Year ‚Äî 1891‚Äì1892, London: Sette of Odd Volumes, 1893. Retrieved 26 October 2011. Other than its core membership of \\"Brothers\\", the Sette attracted many esteemed guests to its supper evenings and it was here that Hait√© met, among others, Jerome K. Jerome, Aubrey Beardsley, John Tenniel, Charles Dickens, Jr. and, on more than one occasion, Oscar Wilde. There are records of at least four meetings with Wilde, the earliest being a report in the Pall Mall Gazette of a preliminary gathering of \\"The British Association of British Artists\\" at London's Grosvenor House on 8 June 1888: Hait√© was there representing \\"art applied to industry\\" while Wilde was present as editor of The Woman's World magazine. Fellow Sette member Edward Heron-Allen (\\"The Necromancer\\") also records Hait√© and Wilde in the same verse of a poem detailing a club dinner on 8 January 1890 when after Wilde's \\"gay and apt oration\\" Hait√© launched into a congratulatory \\"panegyric\\". At the following month's Sette meeting Hait√©'s special guest was Oscar's brother, journalist Willie Wilde. The London Sketch Club 1899 London Sketch Club cartoon of Hait√© by Dudley Hardy In the spring of 1898, Hait√© was instrumental in the formation of the London Sketch Club, a breakaway faction of the prestigious Langham Sketching Club where he had acted as president from 1883 until 1887. The catalyst for this split in ranks was a seemingly petty argument over hot or cold suppers. Those with a preference for hot suppers including Tom Browne, John Hassall, Dudley Hardy and Phil May left the Langham to create their own rebel drawing society. Hait√© was asked to join them as inaugural president and the London Sketch Club was formed, holding its first dinner on April Fool's Day. Although Hait√© sat for a formal oil portrait by Frank O'Sullivan, it is through the many caricatures and drawings in the archives of the London Sketch Club that we have the most vivid representations of both his physical appearance and eccentric mannerisms, frequently depicted mid-oration, arms gesticulating wildly, hair on end and sporting an impressive Jimmy Finlayson-style soup-strainer moustache. Such was Hait√©'s habit of speech-making it made him a frequent target of affectionate ribbing from other members. At the time of his presidency the club's supper guests included Robert Baden-Powell and Arthur Conan Doyle with whom Hait√© shared a love of cricket. After four years as president Hait√© was persuaded to step down in 1902, after which the club would elect a new president every year. Despite his previous desertion, Hait√© was still welcomed at the Langham Sketching Club and would be re-elected its president one last time in 1908.Cuppleditch, David, The London Sketch Club. Alan Sutton Publishing, 1994. Death and legacy In 1883, Hait√© married Fanny Hodgkinson and settled in the new garden suburb of Bedford Park near Chiswick. He lived and worked at two separate addresses there, both of which he christened Ormsby Lodge. The couple had one daughter, Elsie Blanche Evelyn Frances Hait√© (1889‚Äì1971). An invalid for the last nine years of his life, Hait√© died on 31 March 1924. His widow Fanny remained at Ormsby Lodge, The Avenue, Bedford Park until her death in 1935. A selection of work by both Hait√© and his namesake father can be viewed in the prints and drawings collection of the Victoria and Albert museum, Kensington, London.

Megapuss formed as a joke between Banhart and Rogove, where they created the song titles first and wrote humorous songs based on the titles. Their debut album Surfing was released October 7, 2008, and featured a few guest performances such as Aziz Ansari in the song \\"Duck People.\\" Their album was more or less critically panned and deemed too light and crude, although many appreciate it for its humor and its solid songs.

Actor Aziz Ansari contributed to the song \\"Duck People Duck Man\\". Album art The album cover, which depicts the band's two members, Devendra Banhart and Greg Rogove, fighting each other naked, proved controversial upon its release. Rebecca Nicholson wrote that it \\"takes nudity away from vulnerability, and even sexiness, and hands it right back to the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, circa their sock-donning period. Yes, it's obnoxious, but that has to be better than soft-focus sincerity.\\" The booklet that comes with the album contains even more graphic nude images of Banhart and Rogove. Singles A single, \\"Adam & Steve\\" was released on November 7, 2008, along with a music video directed by Amy Jo Diaz. Allison Stewart described the song and music video as, respectively, \\"a freak pop version of the Doors,\\" and \\"entertaining as heck, like something the Monkees might have come up with after not showering for several weeks. And taking lots of drugs.\\" The music video was also reviewed by Spin, in which it was described as \\"a sweetly endearing, jokingly homoerotic display the likes of which hasn't been seen since, well, the latest Judd Apatow movie.\\" Reception The album was met with lukewarm reception after its release, with many critics dismissing it as an intentional joke. Still, the album did receive some positive reception, with Andy Battaglia writing it had a \\"sense of musical adventurousness more engrossing than any on Banhart albums in the past.\\" According to Metacritic, the album has a score of 66%, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Track listing #Crop Circle Jerk '94 4:30 #Duck People Duck Man 3:25 #To The Love Within 2:38 #Adam & Steve 1:46 #Theme From Hollywood 4:42 #Surfing 5:02 #Lavender Blimp 1:18 #Mister Meat (Hot Rejection) 0:25 #Hamman 3:46 #A Gun on His Hip and a Rose on His Chest 3:09 #Chicken Titz 3:56 #Sayulita 7:07 #Older Lives 3:27 #Another Mother 2:46 References Category:Supergroups (music) Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:Collaborative albums Category:2008 albums ","title":"Megapuss"},{"id":"25770001","text":"Stephen \\"Steve\\" Bice (born October 5, 1981 in Sarnia, Ontario) is a Canadian curler from Milton, Ontario.

He soon added to his repertory the parts of Counsel to the Plaintiff in Trial by Jury, the Boatswain in H.M.S. Pinafore, and Samuel in The Pirates of Penzance. In 1916, he was given the role of Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre in the company's new production of The Sorcerer, giving up Luiz. Later that year, he swapped some of his smaller roles for larger ones: the Boatswain for Dick Deadeye in Pinafore, Samuel for the Pirate King in Pirates and Cholmondeley for Sergeant Meryll in Yeomen.

Background and life  Charles Henderson attended Burghley Road Grammar school, leaving at the age of fifteen. He worked briefly at a die-cast metal works before following his father into the Royal Navy.\\"Charles Henderson\\" He served on several different ships and reached the role of Commander by his early twenties. He turned down two offers of Captain. Unfortunately Henderson's language skills - which were very advanced - meant that he was more suited to a desk job. In 1935, he was transferred to the Espionage research Unit. In 1939, as World War Two broke out, he was sent to Europe to liaise with resistance movements. In 1940 he was sent to retrieve Paul and Rosie Clarke, two British children in possession of valuable radio blueprints that the Nazis also wanted. In his mission to get to the children first, he enlisted the help of Marc Kilgour, a French orphan. After successfully evacuating the children to England with the radio blueprints, he realized how useful children could be as spies and so persuaded the government to set up CHERUB. He was shot and murdered by his wife Joan for reasons unknown in 1946.  Physical appearance  Henderson is above average height with dark hair. He has a slightly unkempt appearance but has good teeth.  Academia  Henderson has an aptitude for languages; he speaks the five major European languages fluently and can mimic regional dialects accurately.

Paul Ahyi (January 15, 1930 - January 4, 2010) was a Togolese artist, sculptor, architect, painter, interior designer and author. Ahyi is credited with designing of the flag of Togo. Ahyi was known for his massive outdoor artworks, reliefs and sculptures, including his contributions to the Independence Monument in Lom√©, which commemorates the country's independence from France. Other outdoor sculptures and statues by Ahyi can be found on buildings and in parks throughout Togo, as well as the Vatican, Senegal, Benin, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Nigeria and South Korea. He also created his pieces using a wide array of mediums including jewelry, pottery, ceramics and tapestries. He was also an interior designer who created household objects and art pieces. Biography Paul Ahyi was born to Togolese parents on January 15, 1930, in Abomey, French Dahomey. Ahyi attended school in Dakar, Senegal, from 1949 until 1952. He moved to France, where he enrolled in the Fine Art School of Lyon beginning in 1952. He graduated from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1959 and returned to Togo, which was called French Togoland prior to independence. Ahyi was commissioned to design the flag of the new nation of Togo, which achieved independence from France on April 27, 1960. His finished design, which was unveiled in 1960, is still used by the country. Ayhi used the Pan-African colours of red, yellow and green in his flag, which was modeled from the flag of Liberia using horizontal stripes. The red square symbolized blood shed in the struggle for independence. The flag's yellow represented the soil, while green symbolizes Togo's forests and agriculture. Ahyi added a white star, similar to the Liberian flag, representing light, intelligence and peace. He also contributed to another important Togolese national symbol, the Independence Monument which was constructed in the center of Lom√©. Ahyi's reliefs and sculptures have been installed and displayed at the United Nations in New York City, as well as Canada, South Korea, West Africa, Italy, Japan, and Paris, France. He taught art and architecture throughout Africa during his career. He authored several books, many focusing on the arts and his native Togo, including \\"Togo, mon c≈ìur saigne\\" and \\"La r√©flexion sur l‚Äôart et la culture\\". Awards Ahyi received numerous awards, honors and recognitions through his career. In 1961, he was bestowed the M√©daille d‚ÄôOr des M√©tiers d‚ÄôArts in Paris. Ahyi was made an Officer of the Ordre du Mono in Togo in 1970. He was inducted as a Commander of the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques in 1985 and an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, also in 1985. Ahyi was designated a UNESCO Artist for Peace in a ceremony held in Paris on September 10, 2009. Former UNESCO Director-General Koichiro Matsuura honored Ahyi for his \\"contribution to the promotion of UNESCO's ideals through his artistic activities.\\" Death Paul Ahyi died on Monday, January 4, 2010, in Lom√©, at the age of 79.D√©c√®s de Paul Ahyi, le Picasso africain (French) Le Telegramme Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, called Ahyi's death, \\"a great loss for Togo and Africa and also for UNESCO, which had appointed him as one of its advocates for peace and social cohesion.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Paul Ahyi official site *History of the Flag of Togo *UCF Togo: Paul Ahyi, le cr√©ateur du drapeau national togolais (French) Category:1930 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Togolese artists Category:Togolese sculptors Category:Togolese architects Category:Togolese painters Category:Togolese writers Category:Flag designers Category:Officiers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Category:Commandeurs of the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques Category:People from Abomey Category:Alumni of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts Category:Togolese expatriates in France Category:20th-century Togolese writers Category:21st-century Togolese writers ","title":"Paul Ahyi"},{"id":"25770225","text":"82nd parallel may refer to: *82nd parallel north, a circle of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere *82nd parallel south, a circle of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere, in Antarctica ","title":"82nd parallel"},{"id":"25770229","text":"Jos√© Pedro Alberto (born August 2, 1987 in Luanda) better known as Mabin√° is a retired Angolan football midfielder.

The principle of in dubio pro reo (Latin for \\"[when] in doubt, for the accused\\") means that a defendant may not be convicted by the court when doubts about his or her guilt remain. The rule of lenity is the doctrine that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the more lenient punishment. To resolve all doubts in favor of the accused is in consonance with the principle of presumption of innocence.  Origin  The main principle in the sentence was part of Aristotle's interpretation of the law and shaped the Roman law: Favorabiliores rei potius quam actores habentur (Digest of Justinian I, D.50.17.125); in English: \\"The condition of the defendant is to be favored rather than that of the plaintiff.\\" However, it was not spelled out word for word until the Milanese jurist Egidio Bossi (1487‚Äì1546) related it in his treatises.  National peculiarities  In German law, the principle is not normalized, but is derived from Article 103(2) GG, Article 6 ECHR, as well as ¬ß 261 Code of Criminal Procedure. The principle has constitutional status. The common use of the phrase in the German legal tradition was documented in 1631 by Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld. In Canadian law, the leading case establishing how to decide criminal cases where the guilt of the accused depends on contradictory witness accounts is R. v. W.(D.) (1991).

Pavilions = Antiquity  Apollonia.100px Objects that belong to the 4th century BC The Pavilion of Antiquity is the most important and one of the richest with objects in the National Historical Museum, with 585 objects. The displayed objects start with the Late Paleolithic, where prehistoric culture is proved lively and powerful in our lands, and ends with objects belonging to the Early Middle Ages (4th to 8th centuries). The objects of the prehistoric settlement of Maliq represent the Neolithic flourishing since the middle of the fourth millennium until about 2600 BC. The exhibited objects and the coins of silver and bronze embossed on behalf of the Illyrian kings of the centers of Durr√´s, Apollonia, Shkod√´r, Byllis and Amantia, discovered in the provinces of South Illyria of the 4th to 3rd centuries BC, indicate a strong economy and urban Illyrian culture in general. Impressive are sculptures of the Apolloniates school or God Apollo, one of the most beautiful sculptures of the time (6th century BC). Quite interesting are: the mosaic of The Beauty of Durr√´s (4th century BC), the head of Artemis (3rd century BC), the anthropomorphic appearance of river Vjosa (3rd or 2nd century BC), the head of a man of limestone (5th century AD), vases decorated with red figures, and others. The findings of Monumental Tomb of Lower Selca, Pogradec (3rd century AD) occupy an important place.  Middle Ages  Old pattern of Albanian houses In the Pavilion of the Middle Ages, visitors have access to the economic, social, political and cultural development of Albanians from the 6th century until the 15th. A special corner in this pavilion is dedicated to the Principality of Arber. The handover of power from Skuraj to Topiaj is expressed in the heraldic emblem of Karl Topia located in the monumental portal of the monastery of John Vladimir in Elbasan. A special object of the Pavilion of the Middle Ages is the Epitaph of Gllavenica, which dates back to the year 1373. With photos, documents and objects is given the resistance against the Ottoman occupation of Albanians, as well as key economic developments, political and social life of the country through maps, engravings of the time and quite original publications, the visitor knows Skanderbeg, who personifies the Struggle of the Albanians against the Ottoman Occupation.  Albanian National Renaissance  The Renaissance Pavilion is one of the richest with original objects, documents, books, photographs, national flags, weapons, banknotes, and other cultural objects. Most of the objects are unique to the national history and culture of the Albanians. The objects displayed in the showcases of the pavilion during the period from the mid-19th century until 1912. An object with national value is the flag of the patriotic Society \\"Desire\\" of the Albanian colony of Sofia in Bulgaria. Visitors have the opportunity to look closely the desk and the collection of books that are there, of one of the most prominent ideologists of the Albanian national ideology Sami Frasheri (1825-1904).  Independence  The Pavilion of Independence reflects the key historical moments after the Declaration of Independence in 1912 until 1939. The Declaration (Proclamation) of Independence of Albania from the National Assembly of Vlora on 28 November 1912 and subsequently the formation of the Provisional Government of Albania constitute two important acts of the Albanian national state. In the areas of this pavilion is reflected the Conference of Ambassadors in London (1912-1913). The short reign of Prince Wied in Albania in 1914 marks an important moment in the history of the establishment of the foundations of the Albanian state. The political clashes between the country's governing elite culminated in the movement of June 1924 led by Fan Noli. In the areas of this pavilion is the corner dedicated the patriotic contribution of Fan S. Noli one of the outstanding figures in the history of the Albanian nation and the state of the 20th century.  Albanian Iconography  A collection of 70 items of the Post-Byzantine art in Albania: icons, a proskynetarion, some pairs of Holy Doors and an iconostasis are on display in this pavilion. These objects belonged to different churches in Albania: Gjirokastra, Elbasani, Fieri, Berati etc., dating from the 16th century until the early 19th century. Almost all the best painters who have left impressive works in the churches of Albania, North Macedonia and Greece, such as: Onufri, Onuf√´r Qiprioti, David Selenica, Kostandin Shpataraku, Kostandin Jeromonaku, the Zografi brothers, the √áetiri brothers, and Mihal Anagnosti are represented in this pavilion. The iconostasis (altar screen decorated with icons) comes from the church of the monastery of Saint John Vladimir in Elbasan.  Antifascist War  Mural painting dedicated to the Antifascist war. This pavilion, through its 220 objects, reflects the events starting from the War of Vlora in 1920 until the end of World War II in 1945. It shows the reaction of several Albanian intellectuals in the 1920s and 30s against the rise to power in Italy of fascism. Chronologically, the pavilion displays the ensuing events related to the installation of the fascist regime in Albania on 7 April 1939 and the beginning of organized antifascist resistance. The Albanian volunteers who took part in the War of Spain have their place in this pavilion too. There are also many relics from national martyrs and heroes who gave their lives in the war against Fascism and Nazism. Particular emphasis has been given to the contribution of the powerful (British, Soviet, and American) allies and their missions in Albania. In this pavilion, there are also documents which reflect the support, sheltering, and protection of the Jewish population during the Holocaust in Albania, an expression of the deep humanism of the Albanian people.  Communist Terror  The Pavilion of the Communist Terror was inaugurated in 2012. In this pavilion are displayed documents, photographs and objects, which belong to the period of one-party system in Albania from 1945 to 1990. The historical content of this pavilion is further enriched by film images, provided by the Central Film Archives. An important part of the Pavilion are the documentary and photographic materials which reflect the cleansing operations against the anticommunist forces, a special court against the political opponents during the war as well as the liquidation of the anti- communist opposition. In the showcases are displayed relics which belonged to numerous persons convicted or executed by the regime of that time.  Mother Teresa  This pavilion is dedicated to Mother Teresa‚Äôs family, life and work. The visitors are acquainted with her charitable work for which she has been assigned with many international awards. In the stands of the pavilion there are photos of global personalities who met Mother Teresa as Jacques Chirac, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Ibrahim Kodra etc. Undoubtedly, the personal objects used by her increase the curiosity of thousands of visitors in the National History Museum.

Krause Stone Barn, also known as the Chase Stone Barn, is a historic barn in the town of Chase in Oconto County, Wisconsin, United States. Designed by farmer Daniel E. Krause and built by stonemason William Mensenkamp, the barn has become renowned for its historical significance.Schweit, Ernest. \\"Saving Grace\\". Farm and Ranch Living February/March 2010, 44-45. Construction details Like many other barns, it was built of fieldstone, but in a unique fashion: its walls are more thoroughly stonework than most stone barns, and its massive arch entrances are large enough to permit the passage of large hay wagons through both ends. As of 2010, it is one of two remaining barns in Wisconsin to be constructed from fieldstone. Repair work Seventeen years after its erection, the barn and the rest of its farm were sold by the Krause family in 1920. It had eleven owners between Krause's retirement in 1920 and 1954. During the mid-1950s, the property was purchased by two brothers, who operated the farm into the 21st century and oversaw significant repair work in the 1990s. By this time, the barn had experienced gradual structural deterioration and experienced a 1994 tornado. Accordingly, workers carried out a strengthening and refurbishing process in 1995, which included the removal of a small amount of stonework, its replacement by concrete, and the addition of large beams to strengthen the sagging walls.Chase Stone Barn History , Town of Chase. Accessed 2010-01-11. National Register of Historic Places In 2000, the Krause Barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance. In 2009, the Krause Barn was nominated to be on America's 11 Most Endangered Places 2009 list. Preservation Seeing it as a significant local landmark, local preservationists have concentrated on ensuring the survival of the barn: the town has purchased the barn, and after raising money to continue maintenance, there are plans to convert the barn and barnyard into a park and possibly a museum. The stable area is planned to have a \\"rustic agriculture museum\\" with displays on farming techniques from circa 1900 and antique farm equipment. Other plans include a stone bridge over a creek, a stone walk path, and a historic general store.

Jenkins, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding General, IX Corps. Lieutenant General Jenkins distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea on in the vicinity of Chorwon, Korea, on 9 October 1952. On that date, the Ninth Korean Army Division was attacked by a superior and fanatical enemy force intent upon destroying the division and capturing Hill 395 (White Horse Mountain), a vital terrain feature dominating the Chorwon Valley. General Jenkins, taking with him his subordinate commanders, moved to the critical area in order to personally assess the situation and direct the forces under his command. Despite the extreme dangers from intense and continuous enemy artillery and mortar fire, General Jenkins remained in the danger area and served as a constant inspiration to his subordinate commanders and soldiers throughout the first phase of the battle, during which the friendly troops fought the superior and fanatical enemy to a standstill. After the enemy attack was successfully stopped, General Jenkins remained in the battle area, prepared and launched a counterattack. Through his continued presence in the battle area throughout the day, on foot, or in a helicopter at low altitude, in calm defiance of the enemy, he was an inspiration to his entire command and by these actions was able to supervise and closely direct the counterattack which resulted in annihilation of the determined, powerful and fanatical enemy. The skillful leadership and prolonged outstanding demonstration of personal courage shown by General Jenkins under extremely hazardous conditions constituted vital elements in the successful conclusion of the battle.

It has its historical roots in the original Council of the Judges of the Supreme Court, created by the Judicature Act 1873 to oversee the new Supreme Court of Judicature. This body initially met regularly, reforming the procedure used by the circuit courts, and the new High Court of Justice but met less regularly as time went on, meeting only twice between 1900 and 1907, with a gap of ten years between meetings in 1940 and 1950 respectively. After relative inactivity, it was eventually wound up through the Supreme Court Act 1981, which contained no provisions for its continued existence, something Denis Dobson attributes to newer bodies which performed the duties the Council had originally been created to do. The Council was re-established in 1988 following suggestions by both academics and members of the judiciary, initially as an informal body composed of High Court and Court of Appeal judges with no constitutional basis, tasked with maintaining judicial independence and ensuring co-operation between the judiciary and the executive. Since 2002 it has established a written constitution and widened both its membership and remit, including non-High Court and Court of Appeal members and also investigating spending priorities within the court system, representing the judges on matters of pay and pensions and maintaining a Judicial Code of Conduct. History=The first Judges' Council The first Judges' Council sprang out of the Judicature Acts, which created a unified High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales, and also gave these courts permission to alter their own procedure. This was criticised on the grounds that the judges might do so ineffectively or slowly.Thomas (2005) p.608 The 1873 bill's eventual clauses contained, thanks to the influence of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, provisions for the creation of a Council of the Judges of the Supreme Court. This Council would oversee the new court system, reviewing its workings yearly, and consider the internal procedures of the court. The Council first met on 6 June 1874, providing recommendations for the circuit courts.Thomas (2005) p.609 They considered the circuit courts again in December 1883, where they recommended avoiding the processing of civil business in some towns where assizes were \\"useless\\" and the cessation of the tradition of reading the \\"proclamation against vice and immorality\\" before every case, ensuring that circuit courts could work with 11 judges instead of 14; despite some opposition, these suggestions were put into practice a year later.Thomas (2005) p.610 In 1892 the Council considered further reform of the court system to deal with growing backlogs in the Chancery Division and the cost of appeals to the House of Lords. They recommended the establishment of a Commercial Court, the creation of a Court of Criminal Appeal to take over from the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, a better division of work between the Chancery Division and Queen's Bench Division, an additional judge for the Chancery Division and the Attorney General of England and Wales to be given power to appeal against overly lenient sentencing, all of which were eventually put into practice.Thomas (2005) p.611 After this the council met irregularly; only twice between 1900 and 1907.Thomas (2005) p.612 There was a ten-year gap between meetings in 1940 and 1950 respectively, and little was done.Thomas (2005) p.613 The original Judges' Council was eventually indirectly dissolved in 1981, with the Supreme Court Act 1981, which unlike previous Acts of Parliament contained no provisions allowing for the Council's continued existence. Denis Dobson, Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, suggested this was because other bodies now existed to do what the Council had been created to achieve.Thomas (2005) p.614 The modern Judges' Council In 1986 Lord Donaldson and Professor I.R. Scott campaigned for a new, non-statutory, Judges' Council, arguing that the judiciary had no representative body. At the same time, Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson published a paper that the executive's financial and managerial control over the judiciary was having a negative effect on judicial independence. On 11 January 1988 the proposal for a new Judges' Council was discussed at the annual meeting of the High Court of Justice,Thomas (2005) p.615 where it was formally established under Lord Lane. The new Council was described in Parliament as: > An independent body without a formal constitution. It has no statutory > basis, exercises no executive functions and controls no public expenditure. > It meets to discuss issues of concern to the senior judiciary and to > represents to the views of the senior judiciary to the Lord Chancellor and > other individuals and bodies. It is wholly independent of Government and is > accountable only to those whose views it represents. Its membership is a > matter for the Council itself and those whose views it represents.Bradley > (2007) p.394 The Council's initial remit was to promote co-operation between the judiciary and executive, maintain judicial independence and make court procedure more efficient. To this end, it was composed of the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the Vice-Chancellor and one High Court Judge.Thomas (2005) p.616 Its current remit also includes maintaining a Judicial Code of Conduct, recommending spending priorities for the court system, representing the judiciary in issues of pay and pensions and liaison with the Judicial Appointments Commission. The Council adopted a written constitution in 2002, and has considerably widened its membership to include representatives from other parts of the judiciary.

History The establishment of Correos de Costa Rica gains momentum with the Costa Rican constitution of 1824, which mandates that the Congress of the Republic must open roads and carry posts and general mail. On December 10, 1839, via government decree the first rulebook for mail is drafted and the ‚ÄúServicio Nacional de Correos‚Äù is created. The first emission of postage stamps was done in 1862, a year later Costa Rica attends the Postal Congress in Paris, the only Latin-American country to attend the event. In August 1883 Costa Rica subscribes to the Universal Postal Union. In 1922 the country joins Uni√≥n Postal Panamericana, integrated by Spain, Portugal, and various Latin- American countries. On March 23, 1868, during the government of Jes√∫s Jim√©nez Zamora, a contract is subscribed between the Secretar√≠a de Fomento and Lyman Reynold with the intent of setting up a telegraphic connection in Cartago, San Jos√©, Heredia, Alajuela and Puntarenas. This project was concluded by the government in 1869, due to the resignation of the contractor. Telegraphy based in the Morse system ceased operating in 1970, and was substituted with the teleprinter or Telex system. Law number 7768, of April 24, 1998, transformed the institution into what is now known as Correos de Costa Rica S.A. a public company structured as a for-profit enterprise, not dependent on the central government. Edificio de Correos in San Jose The downtown building of Correos de Costa Rica, was built in 1917. It was built by The English Construction C.O. Ltda. It was declared as a Valuable Historical Building on October 14, 1980. It also houses the Museo Filat√©lico de Costa Rica (Philatelic Museum). Diversification In the 2010 decade the company diversified its offerings with the introduction of the freight forwarding service \\"Box-Correos\\" which assists Costa Ricans who wish to shop online with a virtual US address. It also facilitates various government services such as delivery of passports and property certifications. In the year 2018 the operation of the smartlocker system known as API was started.

Biography Born at Ashton, Pryse studied in London and Paris, and first won a prize at the Venice International Exhibition in 1907. In the same year, he joined the Fabian Society, and helped to found The Neolith, a periodical of literature and the fine arts; the journal was printed in lithography. He was a regular exhibitor at the Senefelder Club,British Printmakers 1855-1955. London, Garton & Co., 1992, page 69 and contributed works to Punch, the Strand Magazine, and The Graphic. First World War During the Great War, Pryse produced a considerable body of lithographic work, some of it in color under the title Autumn Campaign (1914). This was based in his time in France and Belgium at the beginning of the war when he drove around in a Mercedes carrying lithographic stones in the back. He served as a dispatch rider for the Belgian government and was present at the Siege of Antwerp. The artist wrote a memoir of this time entitled Four Days: an account of a journey in France made between 28 and 31 August 1914, published by John Lane in 1932. Pryse also saw some of the Battle of the Marne and the Aisne but was back in Belgium to record the fall of Ostend and the subsequent retirement along the River Yser. Pryse also worked with the Indian Army in France and several of his lithographs depict scenes of Indian troops. Later, he served as a captain in the Queen Victoria's Rifles, King's Royal Rifle Corps, and was mentioned in dispatches.Queen Victoria Rifles Association, 1957; see also Keeson, C.A. (1923). The History & Records of Queen Victoria's Rifles 1792-1922. London: Constable, pp. 327-358. His main action was in the Third Battle of Ypres where he won the Military Cross, the 1914 Star, the Order of the Crown of Belgium, the Croix de Guerre. By the end of 1916, Pryse had made an application to become a war artist, and towards the end of the war, was granted permission to sketch at the front and he was able to record the conditions of trench warfare in numerous water-color drawings, but many of these were lost in the German offensive of 1918.Times obituary, 30 November 1956, page 10 The remaining drawings were exhibited later in London and were described as having \\"a freshness and authenticity that were not always apparent in the works of the official war artists.\\"Times obituary, 30 November 1956, page 10 Unfortunately, many of these were destroyed by enemy action during the Second World War. He left the regiment at the end of the war but rejoined it in 1921 when the battalion was stationed on Wormwood Scrubbs for three months during a coal strike.Times obituary, 30 November 1956, page 10 During the war, he also designed a number of posters including several published by Frank Pick for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London in London, as well as for the Labour Party, The British Red Cross, and for the Empire Marketing Board. One of his most famous posters, entitled The Only Road for an Englishman shows a regiment of British soldiers marching through a ruined town.A. Galatin, Art and the Great War (1919), page 139 Pryse was one of the illustrators selected by Percy Bradshaw for inclusion in his The Art of the Illustrator (1917-1918). Post-War He worked in Hammersmith from 1914‚Äì1925, but in 1925 traveled to Morocco and observed some of the fighting there against the French.Pryse wrote an article on his experiences in the region: \\"Through the lines to Abd- El-Krim's Stronghold in the Rif,\\" Blackwood's Magazine, No. MCCCXX, Vol. CCXVIII, October 1925, pp. 437-476 He returned to the country and lived there for some years after 1950. Pryse was commissioned in 1924 to create a series of lithographs for the British Empire Exhibition illustrating the extent and variety of life with the British Empire. His work was part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics. In 1932, he married Murial Anstace Theodore, the daughter of the Rev. Laurence Farrall, and had three daughters. He died at Cranford House, Stourton, Worcestershire on 28 November 1956 aged 74. He had married Muriel Anstace Theodora, daughter of the Rev. Laurence Farrall, in 1932, and they had three daughters, one of whom, Tessa Spencer Pryse, a landscape artist, became an art student against her father's wishes.

In the game, the player controls Captain Viridian, who must rescue their spacecrew after a teleporter malfunction caused them to be separated in Dimension VVVVVV. The gameplay is characterized by the inability of the player to jump, instead opting on controlling the direction of gravity, causing the player to fall upwards or downwards. The game consists of more than 400 individual rooms, and also supports the creation of user-created levels. The game was built in Adobe Flash and released on January 11, 2010, for Microsoft Windows and OS X. The game was ported to C++ by Simon Roth in 2011, and released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #3. The port to C++ allowed the porting of the game to other platforms such as Linux, Pandora, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch.  Gameplay  In this room, Captain Viridian must avoid the red spikes and green ghost. The \\"C\\" icon to the left of the spike pit is a checkpoint, which the player is returned to upon dying. Unlike most platforming games, in VVVVVV the player is not able to jump, but instead can reverse the direction of gravity when standing on a surface, causing Captain Viridian to fall either upwards or downwards. This feature was first seen in the 1986 8-bit game Terminus. The player uses this mechanic to traverse the game's environment and avoid various hazards, including stationary spikes and moving enemies. Later areas introduce new mechanics such as moving floors or rooms which, upon touching one edge of the screen, cause the player character to appear on the other side. VVVVVV contains eight main levels, including an intro level, four levels which can be accessed in a non-linear sequence, two intermission levels, and one final level, only seen outside Dimension VVVVVV (in a \\"polar dimension\\"). These are situated inside a large open world for the player to explore, spanning more than 400 individual rooms. Due to its high level of difficulty, the game world contains many checkpoints, to which the player's character is reset upon death.  Plot  The player controls Captain Viridian, who at the outset of VVVVVV must evacuate the spaceship along with the captain's crew, when the ship becomes affected by \\"dimensional interference\\". The crew escapes through a teleporter on the ship; however, Captain Viridian becomes separated from the rest of the crew on the other end of the teleporter. Upon returning to the ship, the Captain learns that the ship is trapped in an alternative dimension (referred to as Dimension VVVVVV), and that the ship's crew has been scattered throughout this dimension. The player's goal, as Captain Viridian, is to rescue the missing crew members and find the cause of the dimensional interference.  Development  The gravity- flipping mechanic of VVVVVV is based on an earlier game designed by Cavanagh, entitled Sine Wave Ninja. In an interview with IndieGames.com, Cavanagh said that he was interested in using this idea as a core concept of a game, something he felt other games which include a gravity-flipping mechanism had never done before. Cavanagh first unveiled VVVVVV on his blog in June 2009. The game had been in development for two weeks, and Cavanagh estimated that the game would be finished in another two, \\"but hopefully not much longer.\\" A follow-up post published in July 2009 included screenshots of the game and an explanation of the game's gravity-flipping mechanic. Cavanagh wrote that VVVVVV, unlike some of his previous work such as Judith and Pathways, would not be a \\"storytelling experiment\\", but rather \\"focused on the level design\\". The game was first shown publicly at the 2009 Eurogamer Expo, which gave Cavanagh the opportunity to collect feedback from players. In December 2009, a beta version of VVVVVV which had been given to donors was leaked on 4chan. The visual style of VVVVVV is heavily inspired by games released for the Commodore 64 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially Jet Set Willy which is referenced by the element of collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game \\"that looked and felt like the C64 games I grew up with.\\" He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, who created every room name in the final version. The graphical style of VVVVVV is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on chiptune elements. Swedish composer Magnus P√•lsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled PPPPPP. Cavanagh also considered this game an opportunity to indulge in his \\"retro fetish\\". He has said because he lacks the technical prowess to make more modern-looking games, he instead focuses on making them visually interesting; additionally, he finds this to be made easier by \\"work[ing] within narrow limits\\". VVVVVV was the first game which Cavanagh sold commercially. While his previous games were all released as freeware, due to the size of VVVVVV compared to his previous work, Cavanagh felt that he \\"couldn't see [himself] going down that route.\\"The Sad Elephant near Space Station 2 VVVVVV contains many strange visual elements, most notable of which being the sad elephant, sometimes also called the elephant in the room, which is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant for a short period of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.  Release  VVVVVV was released on January 11, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. A trial version of the game is playable on the website Kongregate. A Linux version was in development, but a number of technical difficulties arose in the porting process, which led Cavanagh to cancel it for the time being. The game was rewritten in C++ by games developer Simon Roth in 2011, allowing Linux support to be successfully implemented. This formed version 2.0 of VVVVVV, launched on July 24, 2011 as part of the third Humble Indie Bundle. Version 2.0 also features support for custom levels, and a level editor. The C++ port also allowed for the implementation of new graphics modes and various speed improvements. Version 2.0, however, does not support saved games from the original Flash version of VVVVVV; many players received this update via Steam without warning, and hence were unable to continue their existing saved games. A save-file exporter is in development. Based on this source code it was also ported in 2011 for the Open Pandora, which requires the data files from the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X or Linux version of the game to work. On October 7, 2011, it was announced that a version of the game was being made for Nintendo 3DS by Nicalis. It was released on December 29, 2011 in North America and May 10, 2012 in Europe. The Nintendo 3DS version was eventually released in Japan on October 12, 2016, courtesy of Japanese publisher Pikii. In 2010, a demo of the game's early levels was ported to the Commodore 64 by programmer Paul Koller, with Cavanagh's assistance. In April 2017 a complete port to the Commodore 64 was released by developer Laxity. On the 10th anniversary of the game's release in January 2020, Cavanagh made its source code publicly available on GitHub.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of VVVVVV was composed by chiptune musician Magnus P√•lsson (also known as SoulEye). Cavanagh approached P√•lsson to compose VVVVVV after playing Space Phallus, an indie game by Charlie's Games, which featured a song by him. P√•lsson wrote on the Distractionware blog that, upon playing Cavanagh's previous games, he was \\"amazed at the depth that came with the games, even though they were small and short.\\" In writing the music for VVVVVV, P√•lsson aimed to make \\"uptempo happy songs that would ingrain themselves into your minds whether you want to or not, hopefully so much so that you‚Äôd go humming on them when not playing, and making you want to come back to the game even more.\\" The complete soundtrack, titled PPPPPP, was released alongside VVVVVV and is sold as a music download or CD on P√•lsson's personal website. On June 12, 2014 P√•lsson released a power metal version of the soundtrack titled MMMMMM which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy. The album contains a mod file to replace the in-game music with the metal tracks. Video game record label Materia Collective released a 180g picture disc vinyl LP edition on January 11, 2020. https://blipblop.net/release/vvvvvvinyl/  Reception  VVVVVV has been generally well received by critics, earning a score of 81/100 for the Windows version and 83/100 for the 3DS version on review aggregator website Metacritic. The game was noted for being the first important independent release of 2010; Kieron Gillen of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called it \\"the first great Indie game of the year\\", while Michael Rose, writing for IndieGames.com, noted that the release of VVVVVV followed a year which \\"some may argue...didn't really deliver an outstanding indie title which showed the mainstream that independent developers mean business.\\" The level design of VVVVVV was lauded by critics: Rose considered the game to have no filler content, which he found to be \\"one of the game's strongest points\\". Michael McWhertor of gaming news blog Kotaku wrote that the game's areas contained \\"a surprising amount of variation throughout...ensuring that VVVVVV never feels like its designer failed to explore the gameplay possibilities.\\" Most reviewers wrote of VVVVVV high level of difficulty. McWhertor found that \\"the game's trial and error moments can seriously test one's patience.\\" However, several critics noted that the game's challenge is made less frustrating due to its numerous checkpoints, as well as the player's ability to retry after dying as many times as needed. These additions made VVVVVV \\"not unforgiving\\", according to IGN staff writer Samuel Claiborn, while still being \\"old-school in its demands of player dedication\\". Independent reviewer Declan Tyson said that he feels \\"victimised by the game's criminally unforgiving collision detection and over-enthusiastically sensitive controls\\" but that \\"it's all worth it for when you reach the next checkpoint and feel that split second of relief\\". IGN‚Äôs Matthew Adler named VVVVVV the 12th hardest modern game, saying it requires quick reflexes in order to survive and that players will likely die many times. The price of VVVVVV when it was originally released was $15. This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's \\"one unfortunate barrier\\" to entry: \\"While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off.\\" Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost \\"does strike you as a lot for an Indie lo-fi platformer\\", while insisting that \\"it is worth the money\\". Since its original release, the price of VVVVVV has been reduced to $5. On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, \\"I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people\\". VVVVVV was awarded the IndieCade 2010 award for \\"Most Fun and Compelling\\" game in October 2010. Game development blog Gamasutra honored VVVVVV in its year-end independent games awards, which earned second place in 2009 and an honorable mention in 2010. The game's protagonist, Captain Viridian, is a playable character in the Windows version of the platform game Super Meat Boy.  Nintendo 3DS homebrew exploit  On May 1, 2016, ShinyQuagsire discovered that the Nintendo 3DS port of VVVVVV can be exploited to load homebrew software. In a similar manner to Cubic Ninja, Nintendo removed the game from the eShop after the exploit was discovered. The game was brought back to the eShop nearly four months afterwards. The 1.1 version of the game fixes the exploit.

Though volunteer units operated before 1812, starting in 1861 they were often referred to as the Volunteer Army of the United States but not officially so named (codified into law) until 1898. During the 19th century the U.S. Volunteers were the United States government's main way for raising large forces of citizen soldiers needed in wartime to augment the Regular Army and militias. The U.S. Volunteers were the forerunner of the National Army in World War I and the Army of the United States in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The U.S. Volunteers did not exist in times of peace. Unlike the militia, which, under the United States Constitution, each state recruited, trained, equipped, and maintained locally, with regimental officers appointed and promoted by state governors and not kept in federal service for more than nine months nor sent outside the country, the U.S. Volunteers were enlisted for terms of one to three years, and between 1794 and 1902 fought outside the country.Chambers II, John Whiteclay, To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America, New York: The Free Press of Macmillan, 1987. Regiments and batteries became known as \\"Volunteers\\" to distinguish between state and regular army units. War of 1812 During the War of 1812, the great majority of soldiers who served were volunteers, or members of state militia who were federalized for portions of the war period. There were also volunteer units directly raised by the federal government. U.S. Volunteers were seen as \\"temporary regulars\\" because they were not state troops, but rather augmented the regular Army.

Life He was born about 1781, the illegitimate son of John Walter, the newspaper publisher. He was brought up a Presbyterian, and went to work at East India House as a clerk. In 1802 he went into journalism, and in 1806 he became a bookseller.P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens (1988), The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe pp. 56‚Äì57. He took the bookshop at the Mewsgate, Charing Cross, vacated by Thomas Payne the younger. He was living in Camden Town in 1808; his father died in 1812, leaving him a shareholder in The Times. He entered the Inner Temple, but never practised at the bar. He moved to Dorset, and again to Burnet, near Bath, Somerset, where he did some farming. Here he had a congenial neighbour in Joseph Hunter; they exchanged copies of collections of dissenting antiquities. About 1834 he moved from Burnet to Pulteney Street, Bath. During the progress of the Sarah Hewley suit, Wilson's judgment went entirely with the defendants, and his religious views, probably under Hunter's influence, underwent a change in the Unitarian direction. Wilson died on 21 February 1847. At the time of his death he was one of the eight registered proprietors of The Times. Works Reading the Memoirs of Daniel Neal, prefixed by Joshua Toulmin to his edition (1793‚Äì7) of Neal's History of the Puritans, led Wilson to collect notices of dissenting divines, and examine manuscript sources of information. He projected a biographical account of the dissenting congregations of London and the vicinity. For his projected work he obtained around three hundred subscribers. He published an instalment of The History and Antiquities of Dissenting Churches and Meeting Houses in London, Westminster, and Southwark: including the Lives of their Ministers in 1808, 2 vols. A third volume of his Dissenting Churches appeared in 1810; a fourth in 1814, with a preface (1 May 1814) showing his personal interest in the older types of nonconformity. According to Alexander Gordon in the Dictionary of National Biography, the later volumes of his work exhibit a softer attitude towards the free-thinkers of dissent, and his facts are given fairly. By 1818 he was ready to publish a fifth and completing volume, if five hundred subscribers could be obtained; but it never appeared. In 1822 he announced a life of Daniel Defoe, of whose publications he had made a much larger collection than had previously been brought together. His Memoirs of the Life and Times of Daniel De Foe 1830, 3 vols., is heavy, but was well reviewed by Thomas Babington Macaulay (1845). He had projected a supplementary work dealing with Defoe's literary antagonists. Wilson attributed 210 works to Defoe, in some cases loosely or with caveats, adding about 80 items to the list given by George Chalmers.The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe pp. 59‚Äì60. Legacy His library was sold (5‚Äì17 July 1847) and broken up. He bequeathed his manuscript collections for the history of dissent to Dr. Williams's Library; a list of these, by the then librarian, Richard Cogan, was printed in the Christian Reformer (1847, p. 758). Family He was twice married, and left a son, Henry Walter Wilson of the Inner Temple, and a daughter, married to Norman Garstin, colonial chaplain at Ceylon.

Amit is thought to have spied for the United States and a European NATO country, though this has never been confirmed by the Israeli government. Early life and career Amit was born in Kiryat Bialik in 1945 to Eliyahu and Tova Lizra. He was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1963, serving in the Paratroopers Brigade, later transferring to the Israeli Navy and graduating from the Naval Officers' School in Acre. In 1967 he left the IDF to work as a policeman, rejoining the army in 1970. Amit was wounded in a clash with Palestinian guerrillas on the Lebanese border in 1972. He worked as a military intelligence officer from the Yom Kippur War until 1979. Amit reached the rank of major, and was placed in command of a military intelligence base on the Lebanese border. He served in Unit 504 of military intelligence, whose function was to operate agents in Arab countries. During his tenure as a military intelligence officer, Amit tried to profit by selling drugs, and he was arrested for drug dealing in 1978. Prior to his court-martial, he was declared mentally unfit to stand trial. He was discharged from the IDF, and spent three years in a psychiatric hospital. Following his release, Amit studied at the University of Haifa from 1982 to 1984, when he dropped out to work as a private investigator.Kahana, Ephraim: Historical dictionary of Israeli intelligence Amit's wife, Tzila, was a physical education teacher at the Yavnieli school in Haifa. They had two sons: Yuval and Oded. Espionage While working as a private investigator, Amit met an American naval officer whose ship had docked in Haifa at a bar in the city, and Amit told him about his experiences in Israeli intelligence. The officer informed his superiors, and a plan to recruit Amit as a spy was devised. The officer told Amit that he intended to retire from the US Navy, settle in West Germany and start a business. Amit responded that he had a wish to make good money, and suggested that they do business together, to which he agreed. Amit travelled to West Germany sometime later, where he met the officer, who introduced him to his \\"friends\\", who were in fact CIA officers from the U.S. Embassy in Bonn. They successfully recruited Amit as a spy. His handler was Tom Waltz, a Jewish CIA officer from the CIA station at the US embassy in Tel Aviv. Waltz instructed Amit on which kind of material was needed. Above all, the CIA was interested in Israeli troop movements and intentions in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Amit was also alleged to have passed classified information to an unidentified NATO country in Europe. Amit continued spying almost until his arrest. Arrest and conviction Shin Bet and the Israel Police began to suspect Amit after one of his friends reported that he had spoken of links with US intelligence. Amit was arrested in the parking lot of his Haifa apartment building on 24 March 1986. During his interrogation, he made a full confession and provided the names of individuals he had met with, as well as meeting locations and dates, and the payment he had received. When his house was searched, classified military and Shin Bet documents were found. Under questioning, Amit admitted that he had obtained the documents from a childhood friend who worked in Shin Bet, and had persuaded him to give him the documents on grounds that it would assist him in some private investigations. Amit's friend was then arrested and admitted to having given Amit the documents, but expressed remorse and denied knowing that Amit was using them for other purposes. He was subsequently sentenced to a three-month prison term and a one-year suspended sentence, and was fired from Shin Bet. After a lengthy closed trial in the Haifa District Court, Amit was sentenced to 12 years in prison in April 1987 (at the time 15 years was the maximum sentence). Israeli media was prohibited from mentioning the case by military censorship, while some inaccurate accounts appeared in the non-Israeli press. Prison term Amit served his sentence in Ayalon Prison, a maximum-security prison in Ramla. According to a television report, he was held in the prison's psychiatric ward and was allowed visits, while other sources claimed that he was held in solitary confinement for many years. The Israeli Supreme Court rejected an appeal by him in 1989. The case was kept secret on security grounds until June 1993, when the Israeli government allowed the publication of Amit's name, conviction, and sentence in response to a petition from the publishers of Haaretz. At one point, Israeli officials considered offering to exchange Amit for Jonathan Pollard, a US naval intelligence analyst who had spied for Israel and had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987. However, when Amit heard of this, he sent a letter to the State Attorney's Office, stating that he had no desire to be any part of such an exchange, and claimed that his confession had been extracted illegally. In 1990, while still in prison, Amit sued Yedioth Ahronoth and Maariv for libel over articles those papers had published in 1986 stating that an IDF intelligence major had been convicted of spying for Syria. Although the articles didn't mention Amit by name, Amit contended in his suit that prison guards and fellow inmates had formed the connection, and the false accusation that he had spied for Israel's worst enemy had severely hurt his reputation and led other prisoners to harass him. Like Amit's trial, this case was kept secret until June 1993. Amit dropped the suit in June 1993 after the papers agreed to publish corrections. During Amit's imprisonment, his father, who died a year before he was released, made repeated unsuccessful attempts to have more details on the case publicized. In October 1993, Amit was released from prison after serving two-thirds of his sentence. Some sources maintain that he was pardoned by President Ezer Weizman. He was paroled on grounds of good behavior, even though he had often violated prison regulations, and also due to psychological considerations.

The Catholic Church has long been an outspoken critic of Freemasonry, and some scholars have often accused the fraternity of anticlericalism. The Catholic Church forbids its members to join any Masonic society under pain of interdiction. Freemasons usually take a diametrically opposite view, stating that there is nothing in Freemasonry that is in any way contrary to Catholicism or any other religious faith. Whether Freemasonry is Anticlerical often depends on how one defines Anticlericalism and what branch of Freemasonry one is talking about.  Anglo-American Freemasonry v. continental Freemasonry  Starting in the late eighteenth century, and rapidly expanding in the nineteenth, Freemasonry became polarized over the issue of whether the discussion of religion and politics was appropriate in lodges. Those Grand Lodges that adhered to the Anglo-American form of Freemasonry maintained a strict rule that such discussion was banned. Historian John Robinson notes this fact in reaching the conclusion that Freemasonry is not anticlerical. The fact that the Continental branch of Freemasonry was concentrated in traditionally Catholic countries may account for the fact that the fraternity has been seen by Catholic critics as an outlet for anti-Catholic disaffection. Many particularly anti-clerical regimes in traditionally Catholic countries were perceived as having a strong Masonic element.\\"In France, in 1877, and in Portugal in 1910, Freemasons took control of the government for a time and enacted laws to restrict the activities of the Church, particularly in education. In Latin America, the Freemasons have expressed anti-Church and anti-clerical sentiment.\\"  Extent of the anticlericalism  According to historians Christopher Clark and Wolfram Kaiser, Freemasonry was not anticlerical from the outset. They state that this changed in the nineteenth century (in part because of measures by the Catholic Church) and that Freemasonry (mostly continental Freemasonry), developed an anticlerical outlook. They note, however, that the influence of freemasonry should not be given too much weight; even in Italy it was eclipsed in influence by non- Masonic groups such as the Carbonari. They also note that lodges did not hold one consistent political line, many being completely apolitical.  Spain  The historian Stanley G. Payne believed that the influence of Freemasonry has often been overstated noting that Spanish Catholics had been accused of suffering from a \\"Masonic psychosis\\" and notes that, numbering near 65,000 in 1890, ‚Äúthey sometimes figured prominently in Spanish liberalism and republicanism, but their direct collective influence on both politics and anticlericalism has doubtless been considerably exaggerated\\".  Portugal  According to historian Stanley G. Payne, members of the Masonic lodges played a major role in the rise of Portuguese liberalism and anticlericalism. However, he notes that the fraternity was not always united in opinion. Masons were found on both sides of the Gomes da Freire revolt in 1817. In 1820, however, Masons were devoted almost unanimously to the liberal cause in politics, and in the 1830s they had become the principal promoters of anticlericalism. After the triumph of constitutionalism, however, Portuguese Freemasonry split into more radical and more conservative groups, and by the 1860s it had ceased to play a catalytic role in politics. The upper middle class, established in power and wealth, were less attracted to it, and by the late nineteenth century Masons were drawn mainly from the lower middle class ranks of white-collar employees. Its place in radical politics at the turn of the century was taken over largely by secret republican radical political societies, especially the non-masonic Carbon√°ria, and by 1912 the Masons had fewer than 3,000 members.  Germany  The Papal encyclical Etsi multa of Pope Pius IX in 1873 claimed that Freemasonry was the motivating force behind the Kulturkampf: \\"Some of you may perchance wonder that the war against the Catholic Church extends so widely. Indeed each of you knows well the nature, zeal, and intention of sects, whether called Masonic or some other name. When he compares them with the nature, purpose, and amplitude of the conflict waged nearly everywhere against the Church, he cannot doubt but that the present calamity must be attributed to their deceits and machinations for the most part. For from these the synagogue of Satan is formed which draws up its forces, advances its standards, and joins battle against the Church of Christ.\\" Para 28, Etsi Multa. The Catholic Encyclopedia also claims that the Kulturkampf was instigated by Masonic lodges.\\"They also instigated the \\"Kulturkampf\\". The celebrated jurisconsult and Mason, Grandmaster Bluntschli, was one of the foremost agitators in this conflict; he also stirred up the Swiss \\"Kulturkampf\\".\\" From Masonry (Freemasonry) in the Catholic Encyclopedia and \\"German Freemasons fostered the Kulturkampf and helped further the dominance of the Prussian state.\\" Freemasonry', New Catholic Encyclopedia, 1967 ed, Volume 6, p 135, McGraw-Hill, New York.  Belgium  The rivalry between the Catholic Church and the Grand Orient of Belgium led to the foundation of the Free University of Brussels which was founded largely by Belgian Freemasons concerned at the expansion of Catholic influence within Higher Education.Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Page 312, Historical dictionary of Brussels, by Paul F. State.  Italy  In the Papal constitution Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo (1821) Pope Pius VII linked the anticlerical Italian secret society, the Carbonari to Freemasonry.\\"It also links Freemasonry with the Society of the Carbonari, known as the \\"Charcoal Burners\\", who at that time were active in Italy and were believed to be a revolutionary group.\\" Roman Catholic Church Law Regarding Freemasonry by Reid McInvale, Texas Lodge of Research. In the period between Italian unification (1870) and the Lateran Treaties (1929) there was a cold war between the Papacy and the Kingdom of Italy (see Prisoner in the Vatican). The Papal Encyclical Etsi Nos,Etsi Nos (On Conditions in Italy), promulgated by Pope Leo XIII in 1882. complained about the way in which post-unification Italy denigrated the role of the church,\\"If ever these perils were menacing in Italy they are surely so now, at a time when the condition of the Civil State itself disastrously imperils the freedom of religion.\\" Paragraph 1, Etsi Nos (On Conditions in Italy). which the Vatican blamed primarily on Freemasonry.\\"It is even reported that this year it is about to receive the deputies and leaders of the sect which is most embittered against Catholicism, who have appointed this city as the place for their solemn meeting. The reasons which have determined their choice of such a meeting place are no secret; they desire by this outrageous provocation to glut the hatred which they nourish against the Church, and to bring their incendiary torches within reach of the Roman Pontificate by attacking it in its very seat.\\" Paragraph 3, Etsi Nos (On Conditions in Italy). Benito Mussolini decreed in 1924 that every member of his Fascist Party who was a Mason must abandon either one or the other organization, and in 1925, he dissolved Freemasonry in Italy, claiming that it was a political organisation with anti-religious influence. One of the most prominent Fascists, General Cappello, who had also been Deputy Grand Master of the Grande Oriente, Italy's leading Grand Lodge, gave up his membership in the Fascist Party rather than in Masonry. He was later arrested on false charges and sentenced to 30 years in jail.'The Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction', Alphonse Cerza, published by the Masonic Service Association, September 1967. The hostility to Freemasonry shaped much of the Catholic Church's strategy in regard to the newly established Italian state. For example, in the encyclical Custodi di quella fede Leo XIII warned against Catholics becoming involved with liberal groups\\"Every familiarity should be avoided, not only with those impious libertines who openly promote the character of the sect, but also with those who hide under the mask of universal tolerance, respect for all religions, and the craving to reconcile the maxims of the Gospel with those of the revolution. These men seek to reconcile Christ and Belial, the Church of God and the state without God.\\" Para 15, Custodi di Quella Fede. and asked Catholics to become more involved in forms of Catholic Action away from the \\"Masonic\\" state.\\"Masonry has confiscated the inheritance of public charity; fill the void, then, with the treasure of private relief.\\" Para 18, Custodi di Quella Fede. In 2007 Italian politicians in the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats and Forza Italia accused ‚Äúradical and Masonic‚Äù groups of being behind a threatened investigation by the European Commission of whether or not the tax-exempt status of the Church's hospitals, schools, and other social service organizations should be withdrawn.Politicians say Masons behind investigation of the Church in Italy, Catholic News Agency, August 31, 2007.  Mexico  The Mexican Revolution was seen by Cardinal William Henry O'Connell in 1914 as part of a \\"Masonic conspiracy\\" in conjunction with the North American Protestants. O'Connell and the American Federation of Catholic Societies urged U.S. president Woodrow Wilson to not recognize the Mexican government, as the Catholic clergy were increasingly stigmatized as collective enemies of the Revolution.Calls It Masonic Conspiracy; Cardinal O'Connell Assails Leaders of Mexican Revolution, November 16, 1914, The New York Timespage 206, The Mexican Revolution, Alan Knight, . The Mexican government's anticlerical stance after the Mexican Revolution coincided with a succession of presidents who were \\"Masons and strongly anticlerical\\".\\"After the defeat and exile of the dictator in the 1910 revolution, a succession of Presidents who were Masons and strongly anticlerical ruled the country under the 1917 Constitution that maintained substantially the same liberal principles of 1857.\\" From Mexican Masonry - Politics & Religion by Oscar J. Salinas E., Past Senior Grand Warden - York Grand Lodge of Mexico (as hosted on the web page of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of Mexico). President Vicente Fox (2000-2006) would state: \\"After 1917, Mexico was led by anti-Catholic Freemasons who tried to evoke the anticlerical spirit of popular indigenous President Benito Juarez of the 1880s. But the military dictators of the 1920s were a more savage lot than Juarez.\\" Fox, Vicente and Rob Allyn Revolution of Hope p. 17, Viking, 2007. President Plutarco El√≠as Calles, a Freemason,Denslow, William R. 10,000 Famous Freemasons p. 171 (2004 Kessinger Publishing). sought to vigorously enforce the secularising provisions of the constitution and enacted additional anti-Catholic legislation known as the Calles Law, which enacted a number of anti-clerical provisions, for example fining priests for wearing clerical dress.Tuck, Jim The Cristero Rebellion: Part 1 Mexico Connect, 1996. Many Catholics rebelled against the oppression, in the conflict which is known as the Cristero War. On May 28, 1926, Calles was awarded a medal of merit from the head of Mexico's Scottish rite for his actions against the Catholics.The Cristeros: 20th century Mexico's Catholic uprising, from The Angelus, January 2002 , Volume XXV, Number 1 by Olivier Lelibre, The Angelus. In August 2007 Pedro Marquez of the Grand Lodge of the Valley of Mexico, in discussing a call by the Church to lift the ban in the Mexican constitution against Catholic schools and newspapers, stated \\"The Catholic hierarchy wants to dictate a political policy and that is a very grave error, as our society is no longer in the era of Christianity and priests are no longer viceroys of New Spain,\\" and that \\"There is a tendency in the Church to meddle in the social and political affairs of Mexico, but the priests should return to their Churches\\".Mexican masons lament decline of influence and launch new attack on the Church, Catholic News Agency, August 9, 2007.  Ecuador  Some attributed to Freemasonry the assassination of Gabriel Garcia Moreno who twice served as President of Ecuador (1859-1865 and 1869-1875) and was assassinated during his second term, just days before he was to take office for his third term. He is noted for his conservatism and Catholic religious perspective. Part of the animosity Garc√≠a Moreno generated was because of his friendship toward the Society of Jesus, and during a period of their exile, he helped a group of displaced Jesuits find refuge in Ecuador. He had also advocated legislation which would outlaw secret societies.Henderson, Peter V. N. \\"Gabriel Garcia Moreno and Conservative State Formation in the Andes\\" p. 28 University of Texas Press, 2008 . This action and many similar ones encouraged the anti-Catholic parties of Ecuador, especially the Masons, to see in him an inveterate enemy. The 1869 constitution made Catholicism the established religion of the state. He was the only ruler in the world to protest the Pope's loss of the Papal States, and two years later had the legislature consecrate Ecuador to the Sacred Heart. One of his biographers writes that after the public consecration, he was condemned to die by German Freemasonry.Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica, Gabriel Garcia Moreno, Regenerator of Ecuador, p. 152. London, 1914. When he was elected a third time in 1875, he and many of his supporters considered it to be a death warrant. He wrote immediately to Pope Pius IX asking for his blessing before inauguration day on August 30: > I wish to obtain your blessing before that day, so that I may have the > strength and light which I need so much in order to be unto the end a > faithful son of our Redeemer, and a loyal and obedient servant of His > Infallible Vicar. Now that the Masonic Lodges of the neighboring countries, > instigated by Germany, are vomiting against me all sorts of atrocious > insults and horrible calumnies, now that the Lodges are secretly arranging > for my assassination, I have more need than ever of the divine protection so > that I may live and die in defense of our holy religion and the beloved > republic which I am called once more to rule. Garc√≠a Moreno's prediction was correct; he was assassinated exiting the Cathedral in Quito, struck down with knives and revolvers, his last words being: \\"¬°Dios no muere!\\" (\\"God does not die!\\") On August 5, shortly before his assassination, a priest visited Garc√≠a Moreno and warned him, \\"You have been warned that your death was decreed by the Freemasons; but you have not been told when. I have just heard that the assassins are going to try and carry out their plot at once. For God's sake, take your measures accordingly!\\"Berthe, P. Augustine, translated from French by Mary Elizabeth Herbert Garcia Moreno, President of Ecuador, 1821-1875 p. 297, 1889 Burns and Oates. Garc√≠a Moreno replied that he had already received similar warnings and after calm reflection concluded that the only measure he could take was to prepare himself to appear before God.Berthe, P. Augustine, translated from French by Mary Elizabeth Herbert \\"Garcia Moreno, President of Ecuador, 1821-1875\\" pp. 297-298, 1889 Burns and Oates.

Crookshank argued that both parents of a person with \\"Mongolian imbecility\\" either carried genetic traits inherited from a commonly shared \\"Mongoloid\\" ancestor, or that all Caucasians shared a distant \\"Mongoloid\\" ancestry. As a result, \\"Mongolian imbecility\\" constituted an atavistic genetic throwback, wherein the supposed ancestral genetic traits of the individual reappeared, having been \\"lost\\" throughout generations of ancestors and evolutionary change. Crookshank believed the re-emergence of these genetic traits was due to the individual in question's incomplete development in the womb.. Crookshank deemed \\"Mongolian imbeciles\\" to be a \\"race apart\\" from Caucasian people, describing that \\"For better or for worse, they are not quite as are other men and women around them\\", and describing English patients with the condition as \\"Mongol expatriates\\". In support of his theory, Crookshank relied on a set of physical traits and behaviors he dubbed the \\"Mongolian stigmata\\", among which he included small earlobes, protruding anuses, and small genitals in both sexes, all of which he claimed to be common among both \\"Mongolian imbeciles\\" and members of what he termed the \\"Mongoloid race\\", which included Chinese and Japanese people, as well as those from Mongolia. Crookshank also cited the cross legged sitting posture of both some \\"Mongolian imbeciles\\" and some depictions of the Buddha in statues as further supporting evidence for his theory.See summaries in Nature, 605, and Despite Crookshank's widely popular depiction of those with the condition, his description of Down's Syndrome as linked with the Mongolian people was not the first in medical literature, with Scottish scientist Robert Chambers credited with the first recorded link between the race and the condition in his 1844 work Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. John Langdon Down, whose name is used for the condition today, coined the term \\"imbecile of the Mongoloid type\\" in 1856, labelling those with the condition the \\"Mongolian type of Idiot\\" as part of Down's wider theory that it was possible to classify different types of conditions by supposed ethnic characteristics. Despite his comparison, Down stressed the fact that the parents of the patients he described were of Caucasian heritage, and that his patients, therefore, were not \\"real Mongols\\". However, in reference to this, Crookshank argued at length that Down's patients, for their perceived similarities to Mongolian people, were, therefore, \\"real Mongols\\" as Down had argued against. Where Down presented his observation that white parents could have offspring who bore a superficial resemblance to other races as evidence of \\"the unity of the human species\\", Crookshank argued the reverse, allying himself with the views of his German translator, Eugen Kurtz, to claim that the different human races were, in fact, different species, themselves descended from different species of apes. Reception The Mongol in Our Midst successfully reached a broad audience and experienced considerable popularity. A contemporary review of the book's third edition in the Journal of the American Medical Association states that the first edition \\"attracted wide attention when it first became available\\",J Am Med Assoc 99 (9): 782. 1932. with an entry in The British Journal of Psychiatry in 1931 remarking that The Mongol in Our Midst \\"excited considerable excitement on its first appearance\\"., However, the book also received some critical approbation at the time; one contemporary review in the journal Nature praised Crookshank as \\"argu[ing] with much skill in favour of his view\\" on atavism, but was more dubious of his promotion of polygenism, noting that it had \\"not found favour among anthropologists generally\\" and that \\"this part of his theory has been most strongly criticised\\".Nature 114: 605 (25 October 1924). One contemporary reviewer remarked whether \\"this theory was ever seriously entertained by anyone other than the author himself\\", with other contemporaries of Crookshank viewing his arguments as \\"preposterous\\" and \\"flimsy in the extreme.\\" A review of the first edition in The Nation wondered briefly whether the whole book was simply a hoax, as \\"The author's thesis need only be stated to be refuted with a laugh\\". Publication and editions The book experienced popularity in the 1920s and 1930s; despite some criticism from medical contemporaries of Crookshank, the book was expanded from its 123 page first edition in 1924 to over 500 pages by its third edition in 1931, with Crookshank publishing his fully rewritten and much expanded subsequent editions in open response and refute to his critics, with the third edition including responses by Crookshank to critics, as well as expanding the book's anthropological and clinical material, including its various speculations and arguments. Subsequent development of medical theory Modern medical scholars regard Crookshank's work as one devoid of true scientific substance, and instead as a product of racial thought of the time, constituting \\"a grand edifice of absurd allegations about the orangutan, the racial 'Mongolian,' the \\"Mongoloid,' all of whom were said to share a variety of homologies.\\" Crookshank's theories were refuted entirely by the discoveries in 1959 of trisomy 21, the genetic defect causing Down's Syndrome, although the term \\"Mongolism\\", despite Crookshank's contributions to its stigmatization, took several decades to fade away entirely.

This reportedly made China the second country in the world after the United States of America to successfully destroy an incoming missile beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Possible purpose The test came just after an American official announced in Taipei that The Pentagon had just approved the sale of the MIM-104 Patriot missile system to Taiwan. In fact, the sale was part of a deal passed by the United States Congress more than a year before. Beijing considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense had voiced its strong opposition to these sales. Observers and analysts think the test was a response to the deal, and showed Beijing's stance on the issue. However, some others believe this test was routine, because an article appeared in the PLA Daily as early as on November 12, 2009 claiming that a new type of Chinese missile provided anti-ballistic missile capability and would go to further tests. Recently, the statements from Zhu Zhuhua (Êú±Á•ùÂçé), a director of the People's Liberation Army Air Force Equipment Research Institute (Ëß£ÊîæÂÜõÁ©∫ÂÜõË£ÖÂ§áÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢) supported the claim. Based on this analysis, the test was coincidental to Taiwan's weapon deal. Basic information The flight of Intercontinental ballistic missiles has three stages in air, the boost phase (the 1st phase), the mid-course phase (the 2nd phase), and the final reentry phase (also known as terminal phase). The Chinese test targeted on the mid- course phase when the target was out of the atmosphere. The test was successful. The full name of the test is called the Test of the Land-based Mid-course Phase Anti-ballistic Missile Interception Technology (simplified Chinese: ÈôÜÂü∫‰∏≠ÊÆµÂèçÂØºÊã¶Êà™ÊäÄÊúØËØïÈ™å). However, the exact launch sites and types of these two missiles are not clarified in Chinese news, although it was rumored that the interceptor was designated the DN-1 or \\"Dong Neng 1\\". According to The Pentagon, Beijing did not inform the test in advance. And the statement \\"We detected two geographically separated missile launch events with an exo- atmospheric collision also being observed by space-based sensors\\", by The Pentagon spokeswoman Major Maureen Schumann, also proves the profile and results of the test.

She took her undergraduate and graduate degrees in history from Washington College (1962), and taught history until the birth of her first child. Ms. Baliles went on to earn a M.A.T. in history from Wesleyan University. She was inducted into the Delta Kappa Gamma honor society (education). Baliles is the founder and chairman of the Virginia Literary Foundation and served as the Chairman of the Virginia Opera. She has served as a trustee on the Virginia Environmental Endowment, the Community Foundation of Central Virginia, and the Jenkins Foundation. She has also served on the board of Wolf Trap, the Nature Conservancy, the Jamestown- Yorktown Trust, YMCA, the Historic Richmond Foundation, and on the Board of Trustees of Virginia Union University and the Richmond Ballet. In 2008, Richmond Mayor L. Douglas Wilder appointed her to a charter-study commission to review the City Charter. Ms. Baliles, who was divorced from Governor Baliles in 1996, has two children from the marriage, Laura and Jonathan. Founder of the Virginia Literacy Foundation When Jeannie Baliles became First Lady of Virginia in 1986, she immediately named fighting adult illiteracy as a major societal issue that needed to be addressed. In 1987, she oversaw the founding of the Virginia Literacy Foundation (VLF) with founding director Mark Emblidge and has served as its chair ever since. Under her leadership, the VLF donates $200,000 per year in matching grants ($4 million so far) to grass roots literacy organizations that taught literacy skills to adults who read at or below basic literacy levels. Ms. Baliles was also instrumental in creating a public-private partnership that would oversee and prevent overlapping services among all community-based literacy organizations throughout the state. During her tenure as the nation's First Lady, Barbara Bush had publicized the plight of the millions of adults in America with low literacy skills, and had influenced the formation of many new grass roots adult literacy programs in the nation, and influential people like Jeannie Baliles. On page 330 of her 1995 Memoir, Mrs. Bush wrote about Ms. Baliles, \\"She is a ball of fire and has done a real job in her state and has shown real leadership in the field.\\" The Foundation also partnered with the State Department of Education in the Virginia Literacy Initiative to encourage the spread of family and workplace literacy programs in the commonwealth. During the 1980s, this model was unprecedented in the nation. Each year the Jeannie P. Baliles Awards recognized the outstanding contributions of students, volunteers and program staff of Virginia's literacy organizations. In 1989, the Virginia Press Women voted Jeannie P.

It displayed a favourable attitude towards the Sinn F√©in movement. Its main rival newspapers were the Cork Examiner and the Freeman's Journal. The Irish People The Irish People newspaper issue February 1908 with Ulster's offer The Irish People (16 September 1899 ‚Äì 7 November 1903), was the first of three newspapers published by William O'Brien. Its object to support his new agrarian reform organisation, the United Irish League. It was a Dublin based politically oriented weekly newspaper, its managing editor Tim McCarthy, previous editor of the Freeman's Journal.O'Brien, Joseph V.: William O'Brien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881‚Äì1918, The Return to Politics p. 114, University of California Press (1976) The paper was financed principally by William O'Brien's wife Sophie, sister of poet and socialite Marc Andr√© Sebastian Raffalovich and daughter of the Russian Jewish banker, Hermann Raffalowich, domiciled in Paris. The Irish People ceased publication abruptly with O'Brien's resignation from public life on 4 November 1903,Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, p. 69, Gill & Macmillan (1999) after he had been alienated from the Irish Parliamentary Party . He had successfully negotiated and won the Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act, 1903 which settled the age-old Irish Land Question, but denounced in an Irish party attack launched by John Dillon MP rejecting his policy of conciliation with landlords. The paper's editor Tim McCarthy only learnt of his demise a day later. As a future editor of the Belfast Irish News he later became one of O'Brien's bitterest critics. The machinery of the Irish People was bought by John O'Donnell MP and moved to Galway, where he set up the Connaught Champion (1904‚Äì1911).Maume, P.: pp. 69‚Äì70 The Irish People (30 September 1905 ‚Äì 27 March 1909) was re-published in Cork after O'Brien's return to public life in 1904, its editor John Herlihy. The paper aimed at furthering O'Brien's concept of national conciliation and promoting full-scale implementation of the Land Act, by encouraging tenant land purchase and extolling its benefits. This through an alliance with the Land and Labour Association which had become the Munster base for O'Brien's renewed political activities.O'Brien, J. V.: William O'Brien .... p. 167 The Irish People, O'Brien's prime political media, propagated from 1906 the cottage building programmes won under the 1906 Labourer (Ireland) Act. Its editorials, usually penned by D. D. Sheehan MP, condemned in regular rhetorical exchanges with the Irish party's Freeman's Journal, the party's relentless campaign against land purchase. The Irish People ceased publication finally in March 1909 when O'Brien travelled abroad to recover from the December 1908 Baton Convention sickened by Devlinite thuggery and corruption, but not before it praised Sinn F√©in as honest youngsters, who could yet be won over by a great new national movement.Maume, P.: The long Gestation p. 95 The Cork Accent newspaper February 1910 The Cork Accent The Cork Accent (1 January 1910 ‚Äì 10 June 1910) appeared on O'Brien's return at the end of the year. The short-lived Cork Accent carried the following explanation of the title in every issue: In its first editorial, it condemned the Cork Examiner as representing a Delvinite form of Catholic Orangism. Further issues covered the resounding success of the eight O'Brienite Independent Nationalists returned in the January 1910 general election, (soon to become O'Brien's new national movement, the All-for-Ireland League), as well as the political stalemate in the House of Commons. In February a fund was launched at Cork City Hall for the publication of a new full-scale daily paper, the Cork Free Press.Clifford, Brendan: The Cork Free Press, in the context of the Parnell Split, p.141-144, Aubane Historical Society (1997), Cork Free Press The Cork Free Press made its appearance on 11 June 1910, with John Herlihy as the first of three editors. The opening issue carried a splendid leading article by the founding member and staunch supporter of the All-for‚ÄìIreland League, Canon Sheehan of Donerail, cautioning against the Protestant class being replaced by a newly rising \\"Catholic Ascendancy\\".Clifford, Brendan, Canon Sheehan: A Turbulent Priest p.17, Irish Heritage Society, Dublin (1990) Canon Sheehan of Doneraile asked in a long editorial, which was the Manifesto of the All-for-Ireland League, published by the Cork Free Press 11 June 1910 \\"We are a generous people; and yet we are told we must keep up a sectarian bitterness to the end; and the Protestant Ascendancy has been broken down, only to build Catholic Ascendancy on its ruins. Are we in earnest about our country at all or are we seeking to perpetuate our wretchedness by refusing the honest aid of Irishmen? Why should we throw unto the arms of England those children of Ireland who would be our most faithful allies, if we did not seek to disinherit them? \\" The League held its public inaugural meeting in March, and from July all issues had one central theme, to promote the conciliatory principles of the League in achieving Home Rule, with extensive coverage of election meetings in preparation for the December elections. It regularly attacked the Irish Party for allying with 'socialists, secularists and land nationalisers'.O'Brien, J. V.: William O'Brien .... p.142 The Redmondite controlled Freeman's Journal countered by rebuking the O'Brienite Independents as dissident factionists. The Cork Free Press continually accused the Redmonite Cork Examiner of supporting the disreputable Ancient Order of Hibernians. Soon after the appearance of the Cork Free Press, however, Herlihy fell out with O'Brien. He had decided to replace the linotype printing machines with newly developed monotype technology, certainly more suitable for book publishing, but not for high-volume newspaper publishing. The Cork Free Press became notorious for misprints, and Herlihy was fired. He unsuccessfully sued for unfair dismissal, was then active as a journalist in London and in the mid-1930s, one year editor of the Irish Press.Maume, Patrick: A Nursery of Editors; the Cork Free Press, 1910‚Äì16 in \\"History IRELAND\\" March/April 2007 pp.44‚Äì46 Herlihy's successor was Hugh Art O‚ÄôGrady, eldest son of Standish James O'Grady, a young Trinity graduate who was sincerely in accord with All- for-Ireland aspirations. The December 1910 general election saw the League victorious in Cork, returning eight MPs, but elsewhere succumbed to clerical opposition. With Home Rule in the offing, the paper reflected the outrage of O'Brien and his party colleagues when Redmond gave way to partition under pressure from Sir Edward Carson, after specific concessions were published in the January 1914 edition of the paper which O'Brien claimed were acceptable to Ulster, to enable it to come in on an All-Ireland Home Rule agreement. The Redmondites saw themselves as achieving Home Rule, the All-for-Ireland League saw them as having achieved partition. When World War I broke in August 1914, Home Rule was set aside. The Cork Free Press published O'Brien's reasoning for giving support to Irish participation in the war, by telling readers that the war had welded the Irish together and to secure All-Ireland Home Rule it was necessary to join Britain and the Allies in their hour of need.O'Brien, J. V.: William O'Brien .... p.212 This was so very much in accord with O'Grady's ownmartial enthusiasm that he eventually decided to resign his post in 1915 and enlist in the war. The London correspondent of the Cork Free Press at the time was Frank Gallagher, a Cork native and from 1915 its third editor, who though himself a separatist, personally admired O'Brien.Maume, P.: The long Gestation \\"Who's Who\\" p.229 He had attempted to dissuade O'Brien from his decision to support the war, as he was rightly worried about the negative effects it would have on circulation and on the League,O'Brien, J. V.: William O'Brien.... p.213 particularly since rising losses and paper shortages forced the paper to become a weekly in mid-1915. Lean to Sinn F√©in After the Rising in 1916, Gallagher contacted O'Brien in London to discuss the attitude of the Cork Free Press to it. He found that O'Brien attributed it to Larkinites. Gallagher said the staff would walk out unless the paper took a more favourable attitude. O'Brien capitulated and soon developed an admiration for the insurgents' idealism and their desperation at possible consequences.Maume, P.: The long Gestation p.181 O'Brien's Cork Free Press soon began to present an altogether favourable attitude towards Sinn F√©in, practically becoming a Sinn F√©in organ. Though the paper continued to point out the lesson that physical force had been proved useless and that what was needed was a united constitutionalism. The editorials took on a distinctly heroic view of the rebels and damned Redmond and the Irish MPs for their anti- Sinn F√©in utterances.O'Brien, J. V.: William O'Brien.... p.221/222 The editorial in the issue of 30 September 1916 betrayed all the hesitance about embracing Sinn F√©in that had distinguished O'Brien's attitude over the years: \\"It is to the Sinn F√©in party that Ireland must now look to mould the future of her people\\".O‚ÄôBrian, J. V.: William O'Brien.... p.223 This mirrored Gallagher's separatist aspirations and that of most of the paper's staff.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: William O'Brien.... p.172 The quasi-separatist attitude of the Cork Free Press increased sales, though paper shortage and lack of capital left its financial position hopeless.Maume, P.: The long Gestation p.189 Suppressed The paper suffered closure because soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press to be careful about what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the Cork Free Press. It was suppressed after Gallagher accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp.Martin, Peter: Censorship in the two Irelands 1922‚Äì39, Introduction p.9, Irish Academic Press (2008) Finally, when in December 1916, O‚ÄôBrien ceased publication of the Cork Free Press, he lost the last effective link with his constituents. To keep the paper alive since 1910 had cost ¬£30,000 of his wife's savings.O‚ÄôBrien, J. V.: William O'Brien.... p.224 In the 1918 general elections, the All-for-Ireland League MPs stood down in favour of Sinn F√©in. Frank Gallagher was subsequently founding editor of The Irish Press and director of publicity for √âamon de Valera (1931‚Äì35).

The VLF was founded by Jeannie Baliles, Virginia's First Lady from 1986 to 1990, and founding director Mark Emblidge, and was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization in 1987. The VLF supports grass roots organizations via challenge grants, direct consultation, and program development training with public partners like The Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center. The VLF also works in partnership with public institutions, corporations, and private literacy organizations in Virginia to address adult illiteracy in the workplace and to provide family literacy training to teachers and parents. The VLF is governed by the founding Executive Director, Mark E. Emblidge, and a Board of Directors chaired by Jeannie Baliles. Reducing Illiteracy in Virginia=Adults Despite a 25-year effort by the VLF and the organizations it supports to teach literacy skills to adults, Virginia still has 853,786 adults who never completed high school (2006 US Census American Community Survey). One out of five adults is considered functionally illiterate, and 662,715 lack basic prose literacy skills. These adults learn to read and write best through the customized one-on-one tutoring provided by the private community-based literacy organizations that the VLF supports through grants and training. The VLF's mission also supports developing workforce skills, at first through the Workforce Improvement Network in partnership with James Madison University, and with PluggedIn Virginia through its partnership with The Literacy Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2001, 34.1% of job applicants lacked the literacy skills needed to do the job they sought. Functionally illiterate adults have a profound impact on Virginia‚Äôs economy. Regions where adult illiteracy rates soar above 25-30% are unable to attract and retain businesses. Coincidentally, these regions also have the highest poverty rates in Virginia.http://www.via.vt.edu/summer08/feature2.pdf Virginia's Not so Hidden Secret: The Adult Literacy Crisis Plugged In, which relies heavily on local business and community support is designed to help adults acquire literacy and workforce skills as they work towards a GED credential or community college credits. Children Knowing that children are 5 times more likely to drop out of high school if their parents are unemployed and lack a high school diploma, thereby perpetuating the cycle of intergenerational illiteracy,http://www.valrc.org/content/factsandstats/pdf/vaace%202009%20fact%20sheet.pdf 2009 VAACE Fact Sheet the VLF has concentrated its efforts on family literacy and working with parents, starting with Toyota Family Literacy Grants in the 1990s. ExCELL (Excellence in Children's Early Language and Literacy), one of the VLF's projects that resulted from a 2008 community partnership in Richmond's northside, helps pre-K children to get ready to learn to read through the development of early language and literacy skills. In support of Virginia's adult literacy organizations=Grant giving Since it was established, the Foundation has funded grass roots literacy programs that have helped 200,000 adult Virginians learn to read. When the VLF was started, the organization supported 34 community- and faith-based literacy organizations across Virginia who served a total of 1,400 adults. In 2008, the number of adult students served per year by VLF supported organizations has jumped to 14,000 adult learners.http://www.virginialiteracy.org/about/index.php The VLF has disbursed over $3.4 million in challenge grants since 1987 to fund data collections systems, program expansion and improvement, operating costs, staff salaries, and the purchase of equipment and supplies. The VLF has collaborated with important public/private partners such as the Virginia Department of Education and the Verizon Foundation, who have consistently awarded funds to help the VLF achieve its mission. Training and Workshops In addition to the grants, the VLF provides technical support and advice and direct assistance with tutor training, board development, and strategic planning through its public partner, the Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center (VALRC). With a yearly grant budget of $200,000, the VLF funds from 26-32 non- profit adult literacy organizations per year. In order to qualify for VLF funds and workshops through the VALRC, these organizations must serve a minimum of 30 clients per year within their communities, follow promising practices in non-profit management, and demonstrate a willingness to strengthen and improve their programs through active collaborations and partnerships with community groups.http://www.virginialiteracy.org/about/index.php Annual Conference Each year, the VLF has sponsored an annual 2-day conference for all literacy programs in Virginia, including those that are too small to qualify for VLF grants. This conference, held in Richmond, provides workshops in program management, tutor training, EL/Civics, and learning disabilities and basic literacy teaching techniques. Public/private partnerships The VLF's public/private partnerships have increased the organization's ability to address illiteracy in Virginia. While the VLF's mission primarily addressed the adult learner, the organization recognizes that the parent is the child's first teacher and that illiteracy must be addressed across an individual's lifespan from pre-K to adulthood. By partnering with other agencies with similar missions, the VLF has been able to work with a larger number of individuals through partner programs and their staff. The Virginia Literacy Initiative The initiative, which brought the public and private sectors together, was one of the first public-private partnerships of its kind in the nation. Founded in 1987 by the VLF and the Virginia Council for Adult Education and Literacy, the partnership increased the number of Virginians participating in literacy instruction from 24,309 in 1987 to over 55,000 in 1992.The Virginia Literacy Foundation: 1995 Report to Virginians, p. 4-5 The Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center The VLF also partnered with the Centers for Professional Development (now the Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center (VALRC)http://www.valrc.org/ at Virginia Commonwealth University and the Virginia Office of Adult Education at the Virginia Department of Education to establish the Literacy Training Office. Training consisted of free professional development and program development workshops and technical assistance training for private volunteer groups. In 2000, four literacy support coordinators representing four regions in Virginia, offered regional technical advice and support to over eighty non-profit literacy organizations through the Literacy Support Center, a unique collaborative public/private project that helped to strengthen literacy programs through training and mentoring. These four positions were consolidated into one, and today a literacy specialist, who works with both the VLF and the VALRC, ensures that training and technical services for nonprofit organizations are coordinated. Regional Literacy Coordinating Committees The VLF, along with the Office of Adult Education and Literacy at the Virginia Department of Education (OAEL VADOE), was also instrumental in organizing and facilitating cooperation among the many private and public adult literacy agencies and social services through fourteen Regional Literacy Coordinating Committees, which served the state through 2017, after the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WiOA) was passed and local public adult education and literacy programs were combined into 22 regions to meet the act's requirements for a one-stop delivery system. The Literacy Institute In 2002, the VLF partnered with Virginia Commonwealth University‚Äôs School of Education and Center for Public Policy to form The Literacy Institute. The Institute ensures that Virginia‚Äôs public policy makers are kept aware of the problem of illiteracy in the Commonwealth and to directly combat that problem through research and development projects.http://www.theliteracyinstitute.org/ The Literacy Institute: Official site Promoting literacy across the lifespan In the early 1990s, the VLF received a Toyota Family Literacy Grant, which allowed the organization to partner with Richmond Public Schools, Richmond Public Libraries, the Department of Social Services and other public entities in order to provide family literacy services for at-risk families. Since that time, the VLF has actively promoted family literacy, encouraging literacy programs to teach parents the literacy skills they need to obtain jobs or seek promotions and help their children with school work. Through its partnership with The Literacy Institute, the VLF has benefited from the expertise gained from three Early Reading First grants that totaled $12 million.http://www.news.vcu.edu/news/VCU_Awarded_44_Million_to_Promote_Early_Literacy In collaboration with the Robins Foundation and Richmond Public Schools, the VLF founded NoRF, now named Excell, a project that addressed the literacy needs of at-risk pre-K children who live in Richmond's north side.http://www.kidsreadytolearn.org/ This research-based program has continued and expanded in Richmond, and is now named Excell.http://www.soe.vcu.edu/aboutus/pdf/tli.docxhttp://www.connectrichmond.org/portals/1/POST%20Survey%20Report%20-%20FINAL.pdfhttp://www.virginialiteracy.org/projects/excell.php ReferencesExternal links *The Virginia Literacy Foundation *The Literacy Institute *About Jeannie P.

Marcaccio was born to a native Argentine mother and Italian father in Rosario de Santa Fe where he later attended the University of Philosophy. In 1985, at age 22, he moved to New York City, where he continues to live and work. He has exhibited widely throughout the United States, Europe and South America. In 2004, Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein organized a retrospective of his work, the same year that a solo exhibition was mounted at the Miami Art Museum. He regularly exhibits with galleries in New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, Cologne and Barcelona. He has participated in numerous group exhibitions, including; the 44th Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC in 1995, Summer Projects at PS1 Contemporary Art Center, New York in 2002, and Documenta 11, Kassel, Germany in 2002. His multidisciplinary collaborations include projects with the architect Greg Lynn that resulted in an exhibition at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio in 2001 and projects with composer Claudio Baroni creating animated operas and a 2005 scored, paintball performance at Weston Hall in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Marcaccio‚Äôs work investigates whether the traditional medium of painting can survive in the digital age. He has used printmaking transfer techniques to make paintings and became well known in the 1990s for his manipulations of the conventions of painting. More recently, he has relied upon digital and industrial techniques to infuse his painting process with spatial and temporal concerns. The results are environmental paintings, animations, and ‚ÄúPaintants‚Äù that combine digitally manipulated imagery, sculptural form, and three dimensionally painted surfaces. On September 10, 2011 Marcaccio received the \\"Bernhard Heiliger Award for Sculpture 2011\\" from the Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit.

As the war burgeoned, he volunteered for military service in aviation on 4 August 1914. He underwent military pilot training at Fliegerersatz-Abteilung 5 (Replacement Detachment 5). After that, he was posted to Flieger-Abteilung 47 (Flier Detachment 47) in Russia in 1915. On 18 October 1915, he shot down a Russian airplane for his first aerial victory. He was wounded on 24 May 1916. On 25 July, he was switched to Flieger-Abteilung Artillerie 215 (Flier Detachment (Artillery) 215)), another German unit stationed in Russia. Here he was assigned a Fokker fighter, but had no success. On 11 November 1916, he was transferred to the Western Front and posted to Jagdstaffel 16 (Fighter Squadron 16). He would not score another victory until 19 June; that win sparked a string of five more, including three on 20 August. However, just three days after his seventh triumph on 4 September, he was wounded in the thigh by antiaircraft shrapnel fragments. He healed at Fliegerersatz-Abteilung 2 (Replacement Detachment 2) until 6 December 1917. Then he was appointed to command Jagdstaffel 42, which he did until war's end. He would shoot down nine more enemy airplanes in 1918, six of them fighters. With his sixteenth confirmed victory on 29 September, he had claims pending for five more victories. As 20 victories was the criterion for award of Germany's highest decoration for victory, an application for Odebrett's award was submitted in October, about a month before the Armistice. However, he never received the award. Karl Odebrett died of liver failure in Caracas, Venezuela on 13 February 1930.

It was built in the 1920s by the South African Railways to supply electricity for the railways, and was subsequently sold to the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom). History Steep gradients on the Natal section of South African Railways, particularly in the Natal Midlands meant that electrification could be beneficial, particularly if regenerative braking was employed. In 1921 the estimated cost of the electrification project, inclusive of the Power Station was . Building started in 1921 and the power station was opened in 1926 with a capacity of 60 MW. Initially it only provided power for the 274 km section of the Glencoe ‚Äì Pietermaritzburg part of the Durban-Johannesburg railway ‚Äì the area that had the greatest gradients, and also the area that was closest to the coalfields of the Glencoe region. Power generated at Colenso was distributed at 88,000 volts to twelve substations where it was converted to 6,600 volts and then to 3,000 volts DC current by synchronous motor generators for use by the railways. The power station was sold to the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) in January 1927. It used coal that was brought in by rail from the coalfields of North Natal and water from the Tugela. It continued to be the provider of electrical power for the railways which by 1937 consisted of the whole of the Natal section of the Durban ‚Äì Johannesburg line (516 route km) and the 229 km spur to Bethlehem in the Orange Free State. Between 1944 and 1959 a series of new generators were commissioned resulting in the power station's capacity being increased to 160 MW. However, in the 1960s, changes in technology led to a change in the economics of power production. New power stations such as Ingagane were built at the coal fields themselves and the use 400 kVA power lines from 1972 onwards reduced the cost of transporting electricity. In the early 1980s Eskom initiated a major development programme: in 1980 new large power stations at Kriel (3,000 MW), Hendrina (2,000 MW) and Camden (1,600 MW) had been commissioned and in the next few years a number of other new power stations gave South Africa a surplus of generating capacity and many of the 1960s vintage power stations (including Colenso's refurbishment) had become uneconomic. This meant that the continued use of the Colenso power station was no longer economically viable. The original part of the power station was decommissioned in 1970 and the 1944-1959 extensions in 1985. Present day In recent years a concerted effort has been in process to re-establish a new, larger, independent base load power station near the original site of the old Colenso power station. With a substantial coal resource discovered near the town and with the gradual liberalising of the South African electric power generation industry, a modern coal technology power generation unit is planned.

He later said of his time in the country: \\"When I went to Argentina I could never imagine how many troubles and personal insults I would have to experience because of my skin colour there\\". In December 2008, Ibrahima continued his football formation as he joined Atl√©tico Madrid, being initially allocated to its B-side. Due to injuries to the first team's offensive line ‚Äì Florent Sinama Pongolle had also just been sold ‚Äì he made his La Liga debut on 2 January 2010, playing the full 90 minutes against Sevilla FC at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium in a 2‚Äì1 win. In the same month, on the 17th, Ibrahima scored his first goal with Atl√©tico's main squad, in another home win, 3‚Äì2 against Sporting de Gij√≥n: after just five minutes on the pitch, he tapped in Sergio Ag√ºero's saved attempt to make it 3‚Äì1. On 5 March 2010, Ibrahima extended his contract with Atl√©tico until 2013, scoring a last-minute equaliser in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Real Zaragoza two days later. He was loaned to CD Numancia in Segunda Divisi√≥n in the summer, in a season-long move. Ibrahima's spell with the Soria club was greatly undermined by injury, as he appeared in less than half of the league's matches. On 13 April 2011, he agreed to join CA Osasuna on a three- year deal effective as of July, with a buyout clause of ‚Ç¨9 million. During his tenure at the El Sadar Stadium, Ibrahima netted seven goals in 23 overall appearances, including a brace against Getafe CF (2‚Äì2 away draw) and the game's only to help the hosts defeat Real Sociedad in the league. He was also afflicted by physical problems. Kuban Ibrahima before a match in 2015. On 23 August 2012, Ibrahima signed for FC Kuban Krasnodar, penning a three- year contract ‚Äì he stated he would not have problems adapting to the new reality, even though his move was delayed due to visa issues. Four days later he scored twice on his debut, and also set up a goal for Marcos Pizzelli in a 6‚Äì2 win over FC Volga Nizhny Novgorod, before coming off in the 71st minute. During a friendly match in early 2014, Ibrahima suffered a ligament rupture to his knee, going on to be sidelined for several months. He netted only four times from 21 appearances in the 2015‚Äì16 campaign, and his team was relegated from the Russian Premier League after ranking third from bottom. With his contract expected to expire on 30 June 2016, Ibrahima reportedly rejected a new deal in December 2015. General manager Valery Statsenko expressed his confidence on an agreement being reached, and negotiations started in March 2016; on 1 July, however, Kuban announced the player's departure. Reims On 31 July 2016, Ibrahima moved to French club Stade de Reims on a 1+1 deal. He made his Ligue 2 debut in the fourth matchday, starting and playing 79 minutes in a 2‚Äì1 home win against Red Star FC, and his first goal arrived on 22 October to help to a 1‚Äì1 draw at RC Lens. CFR Cluj In July 2017, Ibrahima signed a two-year deal with Romanian side CFR Cluj, rejoining his former Kuban Krasnodar coach Dan Petrescu. He made his Liga I debut against FC Voluntari on 20 August, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for Urko Vera; he scored his first goals for the club six days later against ACS Poli Timi»ôoara, netting twice in the 3‚Äì4 away loss. Oviedo On 3 August 2018, Ibrahima returned to Spain after agreeing to a two-year contract with Real Oviedo in the second division. International career Ibrahima was first called up by the Senegal national team in May 2012, and made his debut on the 25th by playing 63 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 friendly win over Morocco. He scored his first goal the following week, helping to a 3‚Äì1 home triumph against Liberia for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Later in the year, Ibrahima was selected by the under-23 side for the Summer Olympics in London. He played in three of four matches during the tournament, netting in the 2‚Äì4 quarter-final loss to Mexico.

Organized in 1727, the originally presbyterian congregation changed in 1786 to \\"Congregationalism\\", then adopted the liberal theology of its fifth Senior Minister, William Ellery Channing, (1780‚Äì1842). For most of the 18th century the church was known as the Long Lane Meeting-House. In 1788, state leaders met in the relatively spacious building to determine Massachusetts' ratification of the United States Constitution. Thereafter the church renamed itself the Federal Street Church in honor of the event.Winsor. Memorial history of Boston. 1886; p.514. In 1803, it called William Ellery Channing, (1780‚Äì1842), as its minister who defined \\"Unitarian Christianity\\" and launched the Unitarian movement, making the Federal Street Church one of the first to define itself as Unitarian. History=1727‚Äì1803 The congregation began as a group of Scots-Irish Calvinists gathered in a converted barn on Long Lane in Boston on November 15, 1729. The inhospitable residents of Boston dubbed them derogatorily as ‚ÄúThe Church of the Presbyterian Strangers,‚Äù and the name stuck. \\"Their first house of worship was a barn, which sufficed until they were able, in 1744, to build a neat wooden edifice. Governor Hancock presented the bell and vane which had belonged to the Old Brattle Street Meeting-house.\\"Drake. Old landmarks and historic personages of Boston.

Under his leadership the congregation prospered. To accommodate the crowds that Channing drew, the third meeting house, designed by the noted architect Charles Bulfinch, was built in 1809 on the Federal Street site.Ellen Susan Bulfinch. Life and Letters of Charles Bulfinch, Architect. NY: Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1896; p.122. At the time, Bulfinch's design received mixed reviews. \\"The lightest and most graceful steeple in Boston is in Federal Street, of the Gothic order. We believe the Federal Street Church is the first attempt at this style of architecture in Massachusetts, and one of the first in the United States. It has great faults, and, indeed, few merits except the steeple.\\"On the rise, progress and present state of architecture in North America. North American Review, Oct. 1836. Quoted in: Architectural Magazine. Jan. 1837. On May 5, 1819, Channing delivered ‚ÄúThe Baltimore Sermon,‚Äù which defined the new Unitarian theology for the burgeoning \\"Unitarian\\" movement. Although Channing originally resisted formation of a new denomination, under the direction of his associate and later successor, Ezra Stiles Gannett, the move toward separation from the Congregationalists began. The American Unitarian Association was formed in the vestry of the Federal Street Church on May 25, 1825, with Channing offering well wishes and Gannett serving as Secretary. Through brilliant preaching, writing, and publishing, Channing made many contributions to the moral thought of his day, none more important than his clearly reasoned though highly delayed statement against slavery, which became a national best seller, even as it alienated some of his wealthy parishioners who opposed abolition. In 1903, on the 100th anniversary of his installation as minister, a statue of Channing was placed in the Boston Public Garden. 1842‚Äì1861 By mid-century overcrowding in the neighborhood \\"necessitated a change of location, and in 1859 the church sold their property and built the elegant brown stone building on the corner of Arlington and Boylston Streets, which was dedicated in December, 1861.Mann.

It was originally workshopped at the McCarter Theatre in 1988, given a full staging at the McCarter in 1990, and was subsequently moved by the McCarter to Lamb's Theatre in New York City, New York in 1990 and had 475 performances. The Lamb's revived it in 1998. The name of the musical comes from Psalm 104:32: \\"He who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke\\" (Psalm 104:32). Smoke on the Mountain is one of the most produced shows worldwide. Cast and crew Book by Connie Ray, conceived and directed by Alan Bailey, sets by Peter Harrison, lighting by Mary Jo Dondlinger, costumes by Pamela Scofield, musical direction by John Foley, musical arrangements by Mike Craver and Mark Hardwick, production stage manager was Erika Feldman, and technical supervision by Joseph L. Robinson. The associate producer was Nancy Nagel Gibbs. Presented by Carolyn Rossi Copeland and Marie B. Corporation. The 1998 cast was as follows: Constance Barron as Vera Sanders, Sean Dooley as Dennis Sanders, Dionne McGuire Gardner as Denise Sanders, John Griffith as Stanley, Jonah Marsh as June Sanders, Robert Olsen as Pastor Mervin Oglethorpe, and Bobby Taylor as Burl Sanders. Plot The songs used in the production were mostly old hymns, with some original and anachronistic bluegrass songs mixed in. The cast plays their own instruments. (Some productions have non-speaking players arrive as additional 'family members'.) Each character has a monologue and a featured song. It is performed in two acts. The setting is in a Mount Pleasant, North Carolina Baptist church in 1938 and it revolves around the Sanders family. The Sanders Family is delayed from performing at the musical revival. Reverend Oglethorpe is forced to get the service going by playing \\"Rock of Ages\\" for those in attendance. Rev. Oglethorpe stalls for time by giving announcements. The Sanders Family enters with great gusto, after revealing their automobile tipped over into a ditch after the whole family leaned to one side of the car to look at all the pickles floating downstream from the Mount Pleasant Pickle Factory. They start the service by singing \\"The Church in the Wildwood\\" and introduces themselves to the congregation (A Wonderful Time Up There). Burl is the patriarch, Stanley is Burl's brother, Vera is the family matriarch, Denise and Denis are fraternal twins, and June does interpretive signs. The first act ends as June and Denise begin to \\"dance\\" (a simple foot kick and hip slap of a tambourine). This upsets the pious Miss Maude and Miss Myrtle (who are the only two known to be in attendance). The dance prompts a stern talking to from the Rev. to the girls because the church \\"doesn't dance.\\" Upset, Stanley leaves in a huff. Burl and Denis leave to go find him, leaving Vera finishing the song through tears of embarrassment. When the family returns, the service continues. During \\"Whispering Hope\\" it is inferred that June is flirting with the Rev. The family is excited to perform one of their signature \\"medleys\\". The family ends the night by quoting the titular bible verse/song, Psalm 104:32: \\"He who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.\\" Song list *I'll Fly Away *The Church in the Wildwood *Built on the Rock *Wonderful Time up There *No Tears in Heaven *Christian Cowboy *The Filling Station *I'll Never Die *Jesus Is Mine *Blood Medley *I'll Live Again *I Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now *Angel Band *Bringing In the Sheaves *Whispering Hope *I'm Using My Bible for a Road Map *I'll Walk Every Step of the Way *I'm Taking a Flight *Smoke on the Mountain *When the Roll Is Called up Yonder Sequels Connie Ray and Alan Bailey issued two sequels to Smoke on the Mountain. The story continues with the sequel, Sanders Family Christmas, released in 1999 (with musical arrangements by John Foley and Gary Fagin). The setting is 1941 and the family has gathered together for a Christmas sing at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church before Dennis is shipped off to the Pacific in World War II. A third production was released in 2006, entitled Smoke on the Mountain Homecoming (with musical arrangements by Mike Craver). The setting is October 1945. The war is over and Rev. Oglethorpe has received a call to preach in West Texas. The Sanders Family has come together for one last sing at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church before the family disbands. Longest Run It is believed that the longest continuous run of \\"Smoke On the Mountain\\" is at the Cumberland County Playhouse in Crossville, Tennessee, first directed by Terry Sneed. His production ran for 10 years. The opening on May 30, 2014 for 22 scheduled performances represents the 21st consecutive year the play has been performed there. Cumberland County Playhouse produces 16 shows in a normal season, playing to over 130,000 patrons.

This list of birds of Washington includes species credibly documented in the U.S. state of Washington. Unless otherwise noted, the list is that of the Washington Bird Records Committee (WBRC) of the Washington Ornithological Society. As of October 2019, the list contained 517 species. Of them, 162 are considered accidental; 11 were introduced to North America or directly in Washington. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Washington as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following codes are used to designate some species: *(A) Accidental - species which have \\"20 or fewer Washington records during the previous 10-year period\\" according to the WBRC. The WBRC requires a formal report for sightings of these species to be included in the official record. *(S) Sight record - species whose records are supported only by written documentation, per the WBRC *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Washington by humans, either directly or indirectly Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Canada goose Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

It is dark violet brown, with yellow marbling, and with a body up to long. A semiterrestrial omnivore, it feeds on algae and various animals including mussels and limpets. Description P. marmoratus on the Adriatic Sea coastline P. marmoratus has a square carapace long, which is dark violet brown with marbling in yellow. It can be distinguished from related species of Pachygrapsus in the Mediterranean Sea (Pachygrapsus maurus and Pachygrapsus transversus) by the presence of three teeth on each side of the carapace. It is capable of very rapid movements, and it uses this ability to dart into crevices, making it difficult to catch.  Distribution  It is widespread in Southern Europe, from the Black Sea to the Moroccan coast, and along the Atlantic coasts of Portugal, Spain and France, and was observed as early as 1996 as far north as Southampton in the English Channel. This range expansion may be due to the warming of the surface waters.  Ecology  Video of algae grazing P. marmoratus is an omnivore, but not an opportunist; similar proportions of algae and animals are consumed however abundant they are in the habitat. The favoured animals in the diet of P. marmoratus are mussels, limpets and its own species. When attacking the limpet Patella depressa, Pachygrapsus marmoratus uses a consistent method, which is usually unsuccessful. On more sheltered shores, P. grapsus eats fewer mussels, but compensates with a greater consumption of barnacles. Predators of Pachygrapsus marmoratus include the musky octopus, Eledone moschata. The larvae of P. marmoratus are planktonic and may survive for up to 31 days. This results in high levels of gene flow between populations, and allows the species to rapidly colonise new areas.

Five months later, on April 13, 1979, her body was discovered in a small body of water approximately one kilometer from her dormitory residence in Compton, Quebec. Upon her disappearance police initially suggested she was a runaway. When her body was discovered police then suggested that she was the possible victim of a drug overdose, perhaps with the assistance of fellow college students.  2002 Re- investigation  In the summer of 2002, the family of Theresa Allore enlisted the support of an investigative reporter and friend, Patricia Pearson, who produced a series of articles for Canada's National Post newspaper that presented compelling evidence that Theresa Allore was a victim of murder, and that her death was possibly linked to two other unsolved local cases: the death of 10-year-old Manon Dube in March 1978, and the murder of Louise Camirand in 1977. The theory was supported by geographic profiler and then FBI consultant, Kim Rossmo, who suggested a serial sexual predator may have been operating in the Quebec region in the late 1970s and advised police to investigate the three deaths as a series. The deaths of Theresa Allore, Manon Dub√©, and Louise Camirand remain unsolved cold-cases.  Aftermath and significance  Since 2002, Theresa's brother, John Allore ‚Äì who produces the podcast, Who Killed Theresa? ‚Äì has continued the investigation, identifying 14 other unsolved murders from 1975 to 1981 which may be associated. He successfully lobbied for the creation of a S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec cold case unit, which was created in 2004. Beginning in 2018, John Allore started to focus on other Quebec cases from the 1970s through the present era, cases that further suggest systemic failures in Quebec criminal justice. On January 17, 2019 the Montreal police, the Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al announced it was creating its own cold case squad, in large part due to the lobbying efforts of John Allore. In November 2018 John Allore was awarded the Senate of Canada‚Äôs Sesquicentennial Medal for his work in victims advocacy for ‚Äúrecognition of your valuable service to the nation.‚Äù The book Wish You Were Here about the unsolved murder of Theresa Allore was published by Penguin Random House Canada in September 2020.

He was born in Lytham St Annes and his family owned a soft furnishings firm. Despite being sacked from his first job in a magazine-printing firm, he became a millionaire by the age of 21. He was the founder of Ingleby Communications, which in 1992 bought out American firm Caribiner. During his seven years in charge of the company, Caribiner became the biggest audio-visual rental business in the world with a turnover of $750 million. In February 1999, Ingleby purchased ¬£1 million worth of shares in Burnley F.C. and was later elected vice-chairman. Early life Ingleby was born in the town of Lytham St Annes, Lancashire the son of the owners of a soft furnishings company. He was diagnosed with dyslexia and struggled at school, and did not learn to read and write until the age of nine. However, he passed his eleven plus exam to gain entry into Kirkham Grammar School where he showed a particular flair for economics. He also excelled at sports and was a keen athlete and rugby player. He continued his studies until A-Level before leaving education at the age of 18. Business career Upon leaving school Ingleby got his first job, selling advertising space for a local magazine-printing business. At the age of 19, he was promoted to head of sales. Soon afterwards, the firm was bought out by a public limited company and Ingleby took an avid interest in the workings of a PLC. In 1983, he lost his job at the firm but the same year he founded the Ingleby Group, a Blackpool-based company that specialised in selling advertising space in display cabinets in hotel foyers. After just one year, the company was valued at ¬£1 million and Ingleby started to increase his business acumen. Ingelby purchased Rose Publicity in 1986 and owned the company for two years before selling it for ¬£13 million. As part of the deal, Ingleby agreed not to compete with the purchasers in Britain and Europe. Ingleby subsequently moved to the United States, originally for three years, to pursue further business interests. His first move in America was to start up Ingleby Communications, a group of companies that staged corporate events. The business was worth $4 million and in 1992 Ingleby bought out Caribiner and took on the company's name. He expanded Caribiner and the firm had departments for web development, equipment rental and sales training programmes, amongst other interests. In 1996, the company was floated on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1998, Caribiner announced a massive turnover of $750 million, becoming the biggest audio-visual equipment rental company in the world. However, the company's fortunes took a sharp downturn and Ingleby resigned as chairman in May 1999 after seven years in charge of Caribiner. Following this, he returned to England and was appointed Executive Chairman of IT investment group Axiomlab. Football interests Despite being a Chelsea supporter as a youth, Ingleby expressed an interest in buying Burnley and made an offer for the club in January 1998. The bid was unsuccessful, but the following year he bought over ¬£1 million worth of shares in Burnley and joined the board of directors in February 1999. Soon afterwards, Barry Kilby was elected to be chairman of the board and Ingleby was appointed vice-chairman, a position which he held until 27 August 2010, when he resigned from the board. It was later disclosed that Ingleby had been declared bankrupt four days earlier.http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/burnleypendlerossendale/8363270.Former_Burnley_vice_chairman_declared_bankrupt/ References Category:Living people Category:People from Lytham St Annes Category:English businesspeople Category:People educated at Kirkham Grammar School Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ray Ingleby"},{"id":"25771779","text":"Garmin 3000 Avionics for the Honda Jet The Garmin G3000 (and G2000/G5000) is an avionics system designed for light turbine aircraft.

He was noted as a teacher, and for his connections in literary circles. Life He was born at Hinckley, Leicestershire, 9 April (O.S.) 1747, was the son of Thomas Estlin, hosier, by his wife, n√©e Prior. His education was undertaken by his mother's brother, the Rev. John Prior, vicar of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and chaplain to the Earl of Moira. In 1764 he entered Warrington Academy, where the divinity chair was filled by John Aikin. Here he decided that he could not subscribe to the articles of the Church of England, but still desired to become a minister of religion. In 1770 he accepted an invitation to become the colleague of the Rev. Thomas Wright at the Unitarian chapel at Lewin's Mead, Bristol, and entered on his duties in January 1771. He soon afterwards opened a school at St. Michael's Hill, Bristol, which met with great success, some of his pupils rising to eminence in parliament and the professions. His pupils held him in so much esteem that they obtained the degree of LL.D. (Glasgow) for him without his knowledge. It was conferred in 1807. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, Joseph Priestley, Mrs. Anna Barbauld, and Robert Hall were among his friends. About 1816 his sight began to fail; in 1817 he resigned his pulpit, receiving a large sum of money from his congregation as a testimonial; and preaching his farewell sermon on 22 June, he retired to a cottage he had built for himself at his favourite summer haunt, Southerndown, Glamorganshire. There, on Sunday 10 August, he died, aged 70. He was buried in the graveyard of Lewin's Mead chapel. Works His publications, of which a list is given at the close of Anna Barbauld's \\"Memoir\\" of him (Monthly Repository, xii, 373‚Äì5), were numerous, and date from 1790. His Familiar Lectures were published in 1818, and are preceded by a reprint of Barbauld's \\"Memoir\\". Family Estlin married first a Miss Coates, secondly a Miss Bishop, both of Bristol. By his first wife he had one son; by the second three sons and three daughters, among them the surgeon John Bishop Estlin, and Anne Maria who married James Cowles Prichard.

Though the play is not easy to categorise, it has been called \\"the only example of an interlude inspired by the fully developed genius of the Renaissance\\". William John Courthope A History of English Poetry (New York: Russell and Russell, 1962) vol. 4, p. 221.  Synopsis  Fortunatus, a beggar, meets the goddess Fortune, and she offers him a choice between wisdom, strength, health, beauty, long life, and riches. He chooses riches and is given a purse from which he can take ten pieces of gold at any time. He then takes himself off to Cyprus to visit his two sons, the reckless spendthrift Andelocia and the more prudent and unimaginative Ampedo. To Cyprus also go Fortune and her attendants Vice and Virtue, who plant two trees, Vice's tree being covered with fair fruit while Virtue's tree hardly bears any fruit at all. Fortunatus visits the court of the Soldan of Turkey, where he tricks the Soldan out of his miraculous hat, which has the power of taking the wearer wherever he wishes to go. Fortunatus returns to Cyprus, but his life of luxury is cut short by Fortune, and his two sons inherit the purse and hat; they agree that Andelocia will take the purse and Ampedo the hat. Andelocia goes to England and woos Agripyne, the daughter of king Athelstane, but she tricks him out of his purse. He returns to Cyprus and robs Ampedo of his hat, then travels to England in disguise hoping to regain his purse. Though he succeeds in abducting Agripyne, she takes the hat and uses it to return home. Not only has Andelocia now lost both purse and hat, he has also been turned into a horned beast by injudiciously eating apples from the tree planted by Vice. Virtue offers to turn him back to his old shape if he will only eat her fruit, bitter though it tastes. He does so, and is transformed both physically and morally. On Fortune's advice he travels to England, in disguise again, in the hope of regaining the purse and hat. There he finds not only Agripyne but also Ampedo. He takes both talismans from the princess and gives the hat to Ampedo, who, recognizing the ill-luck it has brought them, burns it. The brothers are now taken prisoner by English courtiers and, unable to use the hat to escape, are put in the stocks and die there. Fortune takes back the marvellous purse, and appeal is made from the stage to Queen Elizabeth to decide whether Virtue or Vice has been the victor.  Writing and publication  Old Fortunatus is based on the old German tale of Fortunatus, first published as a chapbook at Augsburg in 1509, and again in a slightly different form at Frankfurt am Main in 1550. The story was dramatized by Hans Sachs in 1553. An English play referred to as The First Part of Fortunatus is known to have been written in 1596, but the text of it has not survived, and its relationship to Dekker's play has been the subject of much conjecture. Dekker's Old Fortunatus was written in November 1599 for the theatrical impresario Philip Henslowe and his company, the Admiral's Men. The text as we now have it is a revision made shortly afterwards for a performance before Queen Elizabeth on 27 December 1599. It was published in quarto early in 1600, implying that it was no longer being produced on the public stage.

Revival and critical reception  When Charles Lamb drew the public's attention to the best Elizabethan and Jacobean plays in his Specimens of English Dramatic Poets Who Lived about the Time of Shakespeare (1808) he included substantial extracts from Old Fortunatus, and declared that the man who wrote it \\"had poetry enough for any thing.\\" Charles Lamb Specimens of English Dramatic Poets Who Lived about the Time of Shakespeare (London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, 1808) pp. 56‚Äì63, 441. The first edition of the play for more than 200 years appeared in 1814, as part of C. W. Dilke's Old English Plays. Old Fortunatus was acted at Covent Garden on eleven nights in 1819, with incidental music by Henry Bishop.

The same year William Hazlitt delivered his Lectures on the Dramatic Literature of the Age of Elizabeth, in which he spoke of Old Fortunatus as having \\"the idle garrulity of age, with the freshness and gaiety of youth still upon its cheek and in its heart.\\" P. P. Howe (ed.) The Complete Works of William Hazlitt (London: J. M. Dent, 1930‚Äì1934) vol. 6, p. 234.

He was both one of the first Alexei claimants, and one of the first Romanov claimants to generate any sort of serious publicity in the European and American press. Overview Ivanoff's claim was first documented in 1927 in the Warsaw newspaper Express Poranny and the article was subsequently adapted for publication in the French journal Le Matin by Henry de Korab.Richards, Guy (1970) The Hunt for the Czar. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, pp. 114-116. In his version, Korab reported that he had heard rumours that \\"Grand Duke Alexis\\" (sic) was living as a refugee in Poland, either somewhere in Pomerelia or on the outskirts of Bydgoszcz. He noted: \\"there is on the subject a little conspiracy of silence; the persons knowledgeable about the matter have, no doubt, interest in being silent and only answer you by monosyllables\\". By his own account, Ivanoff fled the Yekaterinberg massacre in the company of \\"an old Cossack\\" and, passing through Siberia, arrived at a German internment camp and, with his knowledge of the German language, succeeded in gaining access. He was repatriated to Magdeburg but then, in 1919, travelled back to Poland because, as he put it, \\"wanting to be nearer to Russia, for I was expecting changes in my country\\". After arriving in Pomerelia, Ivanoff spent two years in the protection of Abbott Biernaz, parish priest of Chelmo, who was quoted as stating that the young man \\"is indeed the most authentic of the Czarevichs that he has, for several years, sheltered under his roof\\". The Abbott further noted that Ivanoff spoke perfect English, German and French, and that \\"he was knowledgeable of the lesser details of the court of Russia\\". He also appeared to suffer from haemophilia, just like the real Tsarevich Alexei. At the time that the article was published, Ivanoff was reported to be living in Bydogoszcz as the guest of a Russian emigre family named Zuruk. It was noted that \\"he sews and embroiders: feminine craftsmanship that the authentic Czarevitch has picked up as a habit during his long illnesses\\". On Sundays, Ivanoff also liked to dress up in the uniform of the former Russian Imperial Army. A photograph of the claimant in uniform, which accompanied the original article, is reproduced in Guy Richard's 1970 book, The Hunt for the Czar. Ivanoff's claim was subsequently reported in several North American newspapers, including the New York Times,\\"Russians hail boy as lost Czarevich\\", New York Times, August 24, 1927, p 13. the Schenectady Gazette (New Jersey)\\"Think Czar's son is still alive; Secluded in Poland\\", Schenectady Gazette, September 24, 1927, p 7d. and the Victoria Daily Advocate (Texas).\\"Think Czar's son secluded in Poland\\", Victoria Daily Advocate, September 23, 1927. After his initial flurry of international publicity, Ivanoff seems to have disappeared from the public record, and his subsequent fate remains unknown.

Early life Otero was born on March 13, 1921 in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, to a Galician father and Canarian mother. The next to youngest of six brothers and sisters, he was raised by a family of teachers and writers, when his birth father couldn't handle raising the children after the death of their mother during childbirth of the youngest. An avowed renaissance man, Evelio buried himself in books and was constantly thirsty for knowledge. Career Otero began working in radio at the age of 18, as a color commentator for basketball games in Santiago de Cuba. In 1945, he arrived in Havana, where his voice was heard on the Cadena Azul network. In 1948, Don Angel Ramos in San Juan, Puerto Rico had decided that his brand new television station, Channel 2, needed an experienced and unique voice talent. Don Ramos had heard of Otero and brought him to Puerto Rico. Evelio became the first voice to be heard on the television sets newly arrived in Puerto Rico. When the word was given to go ahead and launch the Channel 2, Evelio suggested to introduce the station as Telemundo (meaning, roughly, \\"world television\\"). Don Ramos agreed, and the name Telemundo, used today by one of the largest Spanish speaking television stations, was born. Evelio went on to be the anchor for the first television news show in Puerto Rico becoming the first broadcast journalist in the island. Otero married a high school teacher, Consuelo Rivera. Otero moved to Cuba in 1951 with his pregnant new bride. Their daughter, Altagracia (Altita) Otero -- now a psychiatrist -- was born on 9 April 1952. Soon after the coup d'√©tat by Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, Otero returned to Puerto Rico where he continued the television program, and because of his reputation he became the dean of news anchors in Puerto Rico. In 1961, after the birth of his son Evelio Jr., Otero moved to the brand new Channel 4 television station and became the first anchor at WAPA-TV. He had a sense of history, which drove him more than awards or economic success. On 31 December 1972, hall of fame baseball player, Roberto Clemente, visited Otero after appearing at a local game show on New Year's Eve requesting help for the suffering caused by the devastating earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua. Clemente asked Otero if he could go with him as he didn't have any news personnel to cover the charity effort. Otero declined as he had a celebration to attend with his wife and children, but promised Clemente that he would go on the next trip the following week with better planning. Clemente died that night and became a legend in baseball. Otero's wife, Consuelo Rivera de Otero, wrote her doctoral dissertation at New York University in 1973, on the use of mass communication for teaching by the government. This became a precursor to what is known today as National Public Radio and Chennel 6 in Puerto Rico. She graduated with honors and continued her own achievements in mass communication. In 1980, Otero moved to Maryland, where he was hired as a senior editor for the Voice of America in Spanish. Shortly thereafter, he assumed the same duties for the new \\"Radio Marti\\" program of the Voice of America, which was geared towards Cuba and was broadcast from Washington DC. Death Evelio Otero died in a fire in his house in Silver Spring, Maryland, on 12 February 1988, and was buried at the Cementerio Buxeda in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico. His son, Evelio Otero Jr., a Colonel at US Special Operations Command, lived with him at the time, but was unable to rescue him from the fire. He has three grandchildren: Altagracia's daughters Aimee Otero Mahjouri-Kyhn and Alexandra Otero Mahjouri, and Evelio Jr's son Nicholas.

Originally built by the French administration in 1889, ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market has been renovated several times with the latest in 1994 after a fire which almost destroyed the market. Nowadays, ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market is the largest covered market of Hanoi where the wholesale traders sell everything from clothes, household goods to foodstuffs.  History  ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market in an old French postcard At the end of the 19th century, the Old Quarter of Hanoi had two main marketplaces, one at Hang Duong street and the other at Hang Ma street. In 1889, these two markets were closed and replaced by the original ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market which was built by the order of the French administration in 1889 as one of the principal new architectures of Hanoi, together with Long Bi√™n Bridge which was located nearby and completed in 1902. The market was constructed in Hanoi's Old Quarter, only 600 m north of Ho√†n Ki·∫øm Lake. The covered area of the market was about 6.500 m¬≤ with a large roof of corrugated galvanised iron supplied by the French contractor Poinsard Veyret. The most recognizable feature of the market was the 5-arch entrance corresponding to Dong Xuan Market's five domes, each dome was measured 19 m in height and 25 m in width. When the First Indochina War broke out in Hanoi in early 1947, a fierce struggle between Vi·ªát Minh and French forces took place in the area of the market on February 14. To commemorate the event, a memorial was erected near the principal gate of the market in 2005. In 1994, the market was nearly destroyed by a disastrous fire which claimed the loss of about 4.5 million USD worth of stock. After the fire, Dong Xuan Market was partially rebuilt in the original form and it is still the largest covered market of Hanoi. The ward to which the market belongs is also named ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n (ph∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n), this is one of the busiest commercial place of Hanoi with about a half of the total number of households has trading activities.  Activities  Interior space of Dong Xuan Market. Nowadays, the market is run by the ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Shareholding Company (C√¥ng ty c·ªï ph·∫ßn ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n), its three stories are divided in stalls for wholesale and small traders who sell clothes or household goods, foodstuffs of every kind from fresh vegetables to Vietnamese dishes are also found at the rear of the market. As the biggest wholesale market of Hanoi, ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market has to face problems such as counterfeit consumer goods and pollution. ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market's busy trading activities have raised concerns about its pollution, which could be harmful for the health of people living in the area. In 2003, the night market of the ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market was opened on the occasion of the 2003 Southeast Asian Games, this night market is organized as a tourist attraction rather than a business place where one can buy souvenirs, handicrafts and also taste traditional foods or enjoy cultural activities such as ca tr√π and ch√®o. Performers of other traditional arts like ƒë√†n b·∫ßu or x·∫©m artists are also invited to demonstrate their talent in the night market. For this reason, ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n night market is considered efficient way to preserve and propagate the values of the traditional culture of Vietnam. From October 2004, the street in front of ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market, which is also named ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n street (ph·ªë ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n), is made pedestrian street on every Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings so that they can expand the scope of Dong Xuan night market, where thousands of small items can be found at a nice price. Besides the commercial activities, ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market is also a frequent destination of tourists during their visit in Hanoi, where they can find gifts or souvenirs for themselves or their family or friends.

The steel strand is Zinc plated to protect it from corrosion per ASTM A475. Epoxy-Coated Epoxy-coated barrier cable is used on occasion for aesthetic purposes. It is significantly more expensive than galvanized barrier cable. Plastic-Coated Plastic-Coated is similar to the steel tendon used in Unbonded post-tensioned concrete. The only difference is that plastic-coated barrier cable does not have a layer of Post Tension coating (\\"grease\\") between the extruded HDPE plastic sheathing and the steel strand.

The AB-3, a single-seat, single-engined biplane, was designed to equip a light cruiser being built in Japan for the Chinese navy, a single aircraft being accepted by the Chinese. Development and design In 1928, the Republic of China Navy, keen to modernise its obsolete fleet, placed orders for a class of two light cruisers, the Ning Hai class, to be designed in Japan, with the lead ship to be built at the Harima shipyard in Japan, and the second ship, with Japanese help, in China. The ships were designed to carry two small seaplanes each, with a small hangar being provided for a folded aircraft, and the Japanese Navy placed an order with Aichi for a single seat floatplane to equip these ships.Gardiner and Chesneau 1980, pp. 412‚Äì413.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p.69.

They were designed by Cincinnati architect Frederick W. Garber's Garber & Woodward firm. The main building includes an Adamesque barrel-vaulted concourse and Rookwood Architectural Faience entry arch. The Rookwood tiles were manufactured by the local Rookwood Pottery Company. At Fourth and Walnut Streets, the terminal was constructed of reinforced concrete and finished in gray brick, Bedford limestone, and granite. It includes two structures: the four-story south building extending to Third Street, where streetcars entered and left, and the \\"handsome\\" 10-story north building, housing railroad ticket agencies, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, administrative offices of the Cincinnati Street Railway Company, commercial offices, and shops. A long and elaborate arcade runs through from main entrance through the building, lined by shops. The building included marble floors, Bottincino marble wainscot, metal trimmings, and \\"costly brightly decorated ceilings, with fanciful medallions showing little children riding on the backs of various animals\\". The terminal was used for bus service after streetcar service ceased in the 1950s. Buses arriving from northern Kentucky crossed the Roebling Suspension Bridge and took ramps from the bridge into the terminal. In 1998 the ramps were removed, and the bus service ceased using the terminal. The Cincinnati Stock Exchange closed its physical trading floor in 1976 after becoming an all-electronic stock trading exchange but remained in the building until relocating to Chicago in 1995 as the National Stock Exchange.

It has existed in military law since before the 17th century and is an important offence which functions as a catch-all to criminalise offences against military order which are not specified elsewhere. Background The offence of \\"conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline\\" has been described as one of the offences that forms the \\"hardcore of military law\\".Nichols p. 111 The offence is present in the military law of many countries and is often considered a catch-all offence to criminalise misconduct that is not specified elsewhere.Davidson p. 79Nichols p. 130 This kind of offence was first introduced to English military law in the 17th century, the law having previously been \\"minute in its details\\" with no catch-all article.Nichols p. 114 However such articles were found in continental military law such as the Swedish Articles of Gustavus Adolphus issued in 1621 which allowed for \\"whatsoever is not contained in these articles, and is repugnant to military discipline ... shall the several commanders make good, or see severally punished\\". A form of this catch-all article was introduced to England in the Articles of War for 1625 which stated that \\"all other disorders whatsoever are to be punished, as these formerly nominated\\".Nichols p. 113 This had been expanded on in the 1627 articles stated that \\"all other abuses and offences not specified in these orders shall be punished according to the discipline of war and opinions of such officers and others shall be called to make a Councell of Warr\\". The article took on something of its modern form in 1642 when the Earl of Essex's Articles of War stated that \\"all other faults, disorders and offences, not mentioned in these articles, shall be punished according to the general customs and laws of war\\". The \\"conduct to the prejudice\\" concept was introduced at some point after 1700. By the late 18th century the offence had become article 23 of the British military law and allowed for the punishment of \\"all disorders or neglects ... to the prejudice of good order and military discipline\\". This part of British military law was adopted by the Continental Congress for use in the military of the United States in 1775. By 1835 the article was commonly known as the \\"Devil's article\\" within the British Army.Nichols p. 112 Canada The charge is covered by section 129 of the National Defence Act of 1922. The act allows for two separate offences: conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline or an act prejudicial to good order and discipline. Gambia In Gambia the charge is covered by section 78 of the Gambia Armed Forces Act 1985. United Kingdom In the British Armed Forces the offence is covered by section 19 of the Armed Forces Act 2006, which applies to all branches. The offence is categorised as an offence of \\"neglect of duty and misconduct\\" and the covers \\"an act that is prejudicial to good order and service discipline\\" or causing the same through omission. A person may be tried for the offence at a court martial or through a summary hearing in front of their Commanding Officer. Unlike some offences in the Armed Forces Act it is not applicable to civilians subject to service discipline. A person found guilty of the offence may be punished by one or more of: *Imprisonment not exceeding two years duration. *Dismissal from Her Majesty's service (with or without disgrace). *Detention (in guardhouse or at the Military Corrective Training Centre) not exceeding two years duration. Only where the person being sentenced is not an officer. *Forfeiture of part or all of accrued seniority. Only where the person being sentenced is an officer. *Reduction in rank or disrating. Only for warrant or non-commissioned officers. *A fine *A community service order, only where the person being sentenced is also dismissed, is aged over 18 and resides in the UK. *A formal reprimand for officers, warrant officers and NCOs. *A service supervision and punishment order for a period of 30, 60 or 90 days for able seamen, marines, soldiers or airmen only. The offender forfeits one sixth of their pay for the period and may lose their leave entitlements and be made to perform extra work or drill. *Ordered to pay compensation for any financial loss. United States In the US Armed Forces the offence is covered by article 134 (the \\"general article\\") of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). This section states that \\"all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces\\" shall be tried by court martial and punished at the discretion of that court. The general article also covers offences which bring discredit upon the armed forces and \\"crimes and offenses not capital\\". The UCMJ requires that all acts be directly prejudicial to good order and discipline. Examples of misconduct prosecuted under the act includes a chief petty officer \\"cross-dressing in public view\\", a sergeant who mooned another servicemember's wife, and a seaman making unauthorized long-distance calls. Examples of conduct listed in the Manual for Courts-Martial include adultery, bribery, fraternization, gambling, straggling, and indecent language.Davidson p. 80 ReferencesBibliography * * Category:Military law ","title":"Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline"},{"id":"25772189","text":"'Glossy Girl' is a hybrid cultivar of the genus Vriesea in the Bromeliad family.

It was proposed during World War II independently by Y. B. Zel'dovich, John von Neumann, and Werner D√∂ring, hence the name. This model admits finite-rate chemical reactions and thus the process of detonation consists of the following stages. First, an infinitesimally thin shock wave compresses the explosive to a high pressure called the von Neumann spike. At the von Neumann spike point the explosive still remains unreacted. The spike marks the onset of the zone of exothermic chemical reaction, which finishes at the Chapman-Jouguet state. After that, the detonation products expand backward. In the reference frame in which the shock is stationary, the flow following the shock is subsonic. Because of this, energy release behind the shock is able to be transported acoustically to the shock for its support. For a self-propagating detonation, the shock relaxes to a speed given by the Chapman‚ÄìJouguet condition, which induces the material at the end of the reaction zone to have a locally sonic speed in the reference frame in which the shock is stationary. In effect, all of the chemical energy is harnessed to propagate the shock wave forward. However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three- dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed. The Wood-Kirkwood detonation theory can correct for some of these limitations.

Part II of the Act provides the general structure for the management of water resources. Part III then explains the standards expected for controlled waters; and what is considered as water pollution. Part IV then provides information on mitigation through flood defence. Background The Water Resources Act was introduced in December 1991 along with four other pieces of legislation (Water Industry Act 1991, Land Drainage Act 1991, Statutory Water Act 1991 and the Water (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991) whose combined purpose was to consolidate existing water legislation, which was previously spread out over 20 separate pieces of legislation. The Act governs the quality and quantity of water by outlining the functions of the Environment Agency (previously the National Rivers Authority). The WRA sets out offences relating to water, discharge consents, and possible defences to the offences. The Environment Agency has the power to bring criminal charges against people or companies responsible for crimes concerning water. Part II ‚Äì resource management The WRA explains that the duty of the Agency is to ‚Äúso far as is reasonably practicable‚Äù maintain, with water undertakers, secure and proper management of any reservoirs, apparatus or other works which belong to and are operated and controlled by them. The Agency will alert water undertakers as to any arrangements made by the Secretary of State or the Director General of Water Services, and any such arrangements made by them will be enforceable under section 18 of the Acts.20 Water Resources Act 1991 Part III Quality objectives The legal framework for meeting quality standards for the environment is found within s82 to s84. The duty of the Secretary of State (currently the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) is to ‚Äòprescribe a system of classifying the quality of those waters‚Äô.s.82 Water Resources Act 1991 Under s.82, classification regulations provide the standards that must be met for controlled waters to be under a specific classification. In relation to this, the Act provides reference to the purposes of the water, substances within the water or absent from it and requirements as to other characteristics. Under s83, water quality objectives for controlled waters are created by the Secretary of State. Water quality standards provide goals for the Environment Agency to exercise its functions under s84 and to further maintain the quality objectives for controlled waters. Practical evaluation systems known as General Quality Assessments (GQAs) were established by the Environment Agency in attempts to monitor inland waters by testing both biological and chemical substances which could affect the overall health of the surrounding ecosystems. In addition, nutrient sampling is undertaken in the assessments by the Environment Agency to establish whether natural biological waste from runoff in nearby areas is causing a significant change in the water quality. It has been argued that, although the monitoring system can be viewed as an improvement in water regulation, no enforcement techniques are in place to punish those with low- quality GQA results.S. Bell & D. McGillivray, 'Environmental Law',7th edition,(2008: Oxford University Press) s.85 The main water pollution offence Basic outline - Discharge consents are required by the Environment Agency from companies who, ‚Äòdischarge sewage or trade effluent directly into surface water, such as rivers, streams, canals, groundwater or the sea,‚Äô. Consents are set and enforced on an individual basis with regard to quality of the water source and the surrounding catchment. Other factors taken into account include the location and abstraction points used for public water supplies. Water companies are now bound by statutory enforcement to produce 25 year water resource management plans.Environment Agency. http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/32425.aspx Section 85 of the WRA is concerned with the offence of polluting controlled water. The purpose of the section is to impose criminal liability on those who pollute natural water resources. The main offence states that it is an offence to cause or knowingly permit poisonous, noxious, or polluting matter or any solid waste to enter any controlled waters. Further offences, for example, a breach of conditions in a discharge consent, are also introduced by s.85. This is a strict liability offence; intention or negligence by the defendant is not required for the offence to be committed, as illustrated by the word ‚Äòcause‚Äô. The second component of the offence, ‚Äòknowingly permit‚Äô is used less frequently in prosecutions, as it requires proof of intention in order for the defendant to be liable.N.Parpworth ‚ÄòWho may be liable for an offence contrary to s.85 of the Water Resources Act 1991‚Äô (2009) J.P.L 294 The Environment Agency or a private individual or association may bring prosecutions under Section 85. Section 85 does not define the words poisonous, noxious, or polluting; therefore leaving the words open to flexible definition by the courts.S. Bell and D.McGillivray, ‚ÄòEnvironmental Law‚Äô 7th Edition (2008: Oxford University Press)p.607 Controlled waters are defined in section 104 of the Act and include territorial, coastal, inland and ground waters. (ref Water Resources Act 1991 s.104). The penalties for contravention of s. 85, range from a term of imprisonment not exceeding 3 months or a fine not exceeding ¬£20,000 or both. Infringements that are more serious can carry penalties of imprisonment not exceeding two years, an unlimited fine, or both.S.85 (5) WRA 1991 Cases In Alphacell v Woodward [1972] 2 All ER 475, it was found that the prosecution only have to show there was some underlying operation to cause pollution. There is no need for the prosecution to show the defendant was negligent or at fault. A number cases followed that introduced requirements for some positive act on the part of the defendant (e.g. Wychavon District Council v National Rivers Authority [1993] Env LR 230, and found that the act of a third party, for example a vandal breaking a tap on a fuel tank, could break the chain of causation (Impress (Worcestor) Ltd v Rees [1971] 2 All ER 357) However, in the case of Empress Car Company (Abertillery) v National Rivers Authority [1998] Env LR 396, it was held that the law had taken a wrong turn and had to go back to Alphacell v Woodward approach. The idea of a positive act was unnecessary and the underlying operation is that the defendant must do something. The test for whether the actions of third parties could break the chain of causation was whether the intervening event was a normal and familiar fact of life or an abnormal and extraordinary event. De- criminalisation/reform - Commentators have highlighted a number of rationales for the imposition of strict liability; to act as a deterrent, to promote the public interest goal in preventing environmental harm and to promote the polluter pays principle.S. Bell and D. McGillivray, ‚ÄòEnvironmental Law‚Äô 7th Edition (2008: Oxford University Press) Nonetheless, as strict liability offences require no mental responsibility or fault, art of an offence, this can lead to criminalising innocent or accidental actions. Due to a growing dissatisfaction with existing criminal sanctions, alternative sanctions have been considered such as naming and shaming polluters, fixed monetary penalties, discretionary requirements, and enforcement undertakings.P Hampton, 2005- Reducing administrative burdens effective inspection and enforcement, London: HM Treasury Preventive powers S.92 ‚Äì Requirements to take precautions against pollution; The Secretary of State has the power to take precautions to make regulations concerning precautionary measures in relation to any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to prevent it from entering controlled waters. As a result of these powers the Silage, Slurry, Agricultural and Fuel Oil Regulations 1991 were enacted to aid the control and prevention of pollution e.g. through new storage systems for slurry. S.93 ‚Äì Water Protection Zones; The Secretary of State may designate water protection zones, where appropriate for prohibiting or carrying on in that area of activities which the Secretary of State considers likely to result in water pollution. This enables the Environment Agency to exercise control over pesticides and other potential pollutants within the zones. S.94 ‚Äì 95 ‚Äì Nitrate Sensitive Areas and Agreements in Nitrate Sensitive Areas Provides control over agricultural activity with the aim of reducing the amount of nitrate from agricultural land in to groundwater sources ‚Äì targeting areas where nitrate levels breach or are likely to breach the 50 mg per litre set by the EC Drinking Water Directive (80/778/EEC.) Nitrate vulnerable zones from 01/01/09 have risen from 55% and now cover 68% of total U.K landhttp://www.akcagric.co.uk/news.asp?Article=172 S.97 ‚Äì Codes of Good Agricultural Practice Encourages and promotes good framing practices via practical guidance, whilst maintain control and reducing pollution. Part IV ‚Äì flood defence The Environment Agency exercises a general supervision over all matters relating to flood defence. Under s.105 this includes conducting environmental surveys from time to time. Section 106 covers the obligation to carry out flood defence functions through committees. Within each region each committee is empowered to maintain, improve or construct drainage works for the purpose of defence against sea water or tidal water anywhere in their area. They must also provide flood warning systems. Section 107 covers the main river functions under the Land Drainage Act 1991 and this is the power for securing the maintenance of flow of watercourses.

Second only to Gammeltorv, it is also one of the oldest, taking its name from the Amager farmers who in the Middle Ages came into town to sell their produce at the site. Now the square is a central junction in the heart of Copenhagen, dominated by its Stork Fountain and a number of buildings, the oldest of which dates back to 1616. In opposite directions, Str√∏get extends towards Kongens Nytorv and the City Hall Square, the two largest squares in Copenhagen, to the northwest K√∏bmagergade leads to N√∏rreport, the busiest railway station in Denmark, and to the southeast H√∏jbro Plads connects to Slotsholmen across H√∏jbro Bridge, and from there onwards to Christianshavn and Amager on the other side of the harbour. The paving is from 1993 and was designed by Bj√∏rn N√∏rgaard. It consists of a pattern of pentagonal granite stones in five colours. History J. Rach and H. H. Eegberg in 1749, featuring a combination of 17th- and 18th-century buildings Amagertorv dates back to the Middle Ages when Copenhagen was a small fishing village called Havn, the site was the main corridor between the village and the beach. In 1449 it is referred to as the Fishmonger's Market and in 1472 the name Amagertorv first appears. The name derives from the Amager farmers who came into town to sell their goods. Store L√¶kkerbisken In the 16th and 17th century the square became a setting of festivals and chivalrous tournaments. In the same time, Amagertorv continued to be the premier marketplace of the city and from 28 July 1684 all sale of fresh produce was to take place in the square. From 1656 the city's leading inn was also located on the square. thumbleft200pxAmagertorv during the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 Few buildings on the square survived the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The adjoining H√∏jbro Plads was established after the fire. Store L√¶kkerbisken In 1868 the market activities were moved to Christianshavn. In 1894, the Stork Fountain was constructed. It was a present to Crown Prince Frederik (later Frederik VIII) and Crown Princess Louise in connection with their silver wedding. In 1962, the square was closed to traffic with the establishment of the Str√∏get pedestrian zone. Buildings Mathias Hansen House at No. 6 The Church of the Holy Ghost, located at the western end of the square, is the oldest surviving church in Copenhagen. The Mathias Hansen House (No. 6) was built in 1616 for Mathias Hansen, from 1622 the Mayor of Copenhagen. Typically of the Dutch Renaissance style, the house is built in red bricks with sandstone decorations, has a Dutch gable and a copper roof. The copper drainpipes are decorated with dragon's heads. The building was restored in 1898 by Professor Hans J√∏rgen Holm. The gateway is flanked by two cannon barrels used to protect the gate from entering carts. H√∏jbrohus No. 9 was built 1798-1800: for linen merchant J. A. Bechmann. The original shop front at street level was altered in 1830 and again in 1870. The tobacco company W. √ò. Larsen has a small pipe museum in the building. The Ole Haslund House (No. 14) is an example of late-19th century Historicism. The current design is from 1867. The windows have mullions executed as small Hermes figures carrying Ionic capitals. Klosterg√•rden at No. 29 is a former convent. The building is from 1798-00 where it replaced a house designed by Caspar Frederik Harsdorff which was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1795. The convent was founded in 1759. L√∏ve Apotek (No. 33), Copenhagen's first pharmacy, was based at the site from 1620 to 1969. The current building was built for the pharmacy in 1907-1908 to design by Victor Nyeb√∏llle and Chr. Brandstrup. It replaced a building by C. F. Harsdorff. Shopping Amagertorv The Illum department store has been located on the corner of Str√∏get and K√∏bmagergade since the 1890s.

W. Gryphon. The film stars Christina Hendricks, Joaquim de Almeida, Leisha Hailey, and Rachel Hunter. It was directed by first time directors Allison Hebble & Zed B. Starkovich. The film was scored by Ian Ball from the band Gomez. Although Ball had contributed songs to other films such as the Academy Award winning film American Beauty, this was his first attempt at scoring an entire film. The film premiered at the Hollywood Film Festival on October 19, 2007. It won Best Feature at the Beloit International Film Festival and the Los Angeles Backlot Film Festival, and Best Screenplay at the Bragacine International Film Festival in Portugal. A Best Actor nod went to Joaquim de Almeida and a Producers Award to Executive Producer Starlotte Smith at the Bragacine International Film Festival. It was an Official Selection of the La Femme Film Festival and the Portocine International Film Festival, as well as a Special Screening at the Cinema Film Festival. It premiered on Showtime on December 4, 2009. Anthem Pictures released La Cucina on DVD and Blu-ray on January 12, 2010. A.W. Gryphon also wrote the supernatural novel Blood Moon. Allison Hebble, Zed Starkovich and Starlotte Dawn Smith were all neighbors in West Hollywood. They got to talking one day over a glass of wine and decided to make a movie. They called some friends and less than a year later went into production on La Cucina. Plot La Cucina is a brief slice of life that is set in present day Los Angeles, on a hot summer evening in a West Hollywood apartment building. An intimate character study, it focuses on three couples and their very different relationships over food and wine. A young writer, Lily (Hendricks), goes on an emotional roller coaster with the much older (17 years) and sophisticated Michael (Almeida). They navigate through a web of exploration on marriage, cheating, babies, and entrapment. In the kitchen above, the very pregnant Shelly (Hailey) is terrified that becoming a mother will drive away her husband and has turned for advice to her lesbian friend Jude (Hunter), sure that this magnificent cook who has been in a long-term relationship has it all figured out. It is revealed that Shelly has her own secrets that fuel her fear and Jude's relationship may not be exactly as it appears. They struggle through‚Äîfighting, laughing, crying, cooking & eating‚Äîtrying to work out what really makes relationships work.

One of the 9 sons of the Dragon King, he is depicted as a dragon with the shell of a turtle. Stone sculptures of Bixi have been used in Chinese culture for centuries as a decorative plinth for commemorative steles and tablets, particularly in the funerary complexes of its later emperors and to commemorate important events, such as an imperial visit or the anniversary of a World War II victory. They are also used at the bases of bridges and archways. Sculptures of Bixi are traditionally rubbed for good luck, which can cause conservation issues. They can be found throughout East Asia in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, and even the Russian Far East. History A dragon-headed bixi with a stele in memory of the Qianlong Emperor's rebuilding of the Marco Polo Bridge, Beijing, A bixi at the bottom of the Nestorian stele The tradition of tortoise-mounted stelae originated no later than early 3rd century (late Han dynasty). According to the 1957 survey by Ch√™ng T√™-k'un (), the earliest extant tortoise-borne stele is thought to be the one at the tomb of Fan Min (), in Lushan County, Ya'an, Sichuan. Victor Segalen had earlier identified the stele as a Han dynasty monument; present-day authors agree, usually giving it the date of 205 AD. The stele has a rounded top with a dragon design in low relief - a precursor to the \\"two intertwined dragons\\" design that was very common on such steles even in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, over a thousand years later. (A Ya'an tourist trip description, with the photos from the \\"Fan Min Que (Gate Towers) and Sculptures\\" site (), including the present-day condition of the Fan Min stele, in a new gazebo) In the collection of the Nanjing Museum there is a hunping funerary jar, dating to 272 AD, with a miniature architectural composition on top, depicting, among other objects, a tortoise carrying a stele erected by the Jin dynasty governor of Changsha in honor of a local dignitary. Perhaps the best known extant early example of the genre is the set of four stele- bearing tortoises at the mausoleum of Xiao Xiu (475-518), who was the younger brother of the first Liang dynasty emperor Wu (Xiao Yan), near Nanjing.. A reconstruction of the original form of the ensemble is shown in Fig. 5.19. The bixi tradition flourished during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Ming founder, the Hongwu Emperor, in the first year after the dynasty had been proclaimed (1368), adopted regulations, allowing tortoise-based funerary tablets to the higher ranks of the nobility and the mandarinate. He tightened the rules in 1396, leaving only the highest nobility (those of the gong and hou ranks) and the officials of the top 3 ranks eligible for bixi-based stelae. The type of dragons crowning the tortoise-born stele, and the type and number of other statuary at the tomb site, were prescribed by the same regulations as well.. A modern (1995) monument in Beijing At the Hongwu Emperor's own mausoleum, a huge bixi holding the so-called Shengde stele welcomes visitors at the Sifangcheng pavilion at the entrance of the mausoleum complex. Three centuries later (1699), the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty visited Nanjing and contributed another tortoise, with a stele praising the founder of the Ming, comparing him to the founders of the great Tang and Song dynasties of the past. Quote regarding the Kangxi's stele text and its meaning: \\"Ôºâ\\"; regarding the dimensions of the stele and its tortoise: \\"\\"Photo and description of the Kangxi's stele. The inscription is interpreted as \\"His reign was as glorious as that of the Tang and Song\\" The Hongwu Emperor's tortoise tradition was continued by the later Ming and Qing emperors, whose mausoleums are usually decorated by bixi-born steles as well. Even the self- declared emperor Yuan Shikai was posthumously honored with a bixi-based stele in Anyang, as was the Republic of China Premier Tan Yankai (1880‚Äì1930), whose stele near Nanjing's Linggu Temple had its inscription erased after the Communist Revolution. Occasionally, a foreign head of state was honored with a bixi as well, as it happened to the sultan of Brunei Abdul Majid Hassan, who died during his visit to China in 1408. The sultan's grave, with a suitably royal bixi-based monument, was discovered in Yuhuatai District south of Nanjing in 1958. After an ancient Christian stele was unearthed in Xi'an in 1625, it, too, was put on the back of a tortoise. In 1907, this so-called Nestorian Stele was moved to the Stele Forest Museum along with its tortoise.. The first two images reproduced in Keevak's book had appeared earlier in Henri Havret (1848-1901), La stele chr√©tienne de Si-ngan fou (part 1), Vari√©t√©s sinologiques No. 7, Paris, 1895 (near the front cover, and page 139, respectively). As Havret comments (p. 142), looking at the early drawings it's rather easy to mistake the tortoise for a \\"horrible bat\\"!See modern photos of the stele on Flickr.com, complete with the same tortoise These days, long-lost bixi continue to be unearthed during archaeological excavations and construction work. Among the most remarkable finds is the discovery of a huge 1200-year-old in Zhengding (Hebei Province) in June 2006. The stone turtle is 8.4 m long, 3.2 m wide, and 2.6 m tall, and weighs 107 tons. It has since been moved to Zhengding's Kaiyuan Temple. Outside China The Vinh Lang stele from L√™ L·ª£i's mausoleum, erected in the 6th year of Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n reign (1433) Turtle in Thien Mu Pagoda, Hue, Vietnam, 1715Lonely Planet Guide, Vietnam, 2006. p. 70 The concept of a tortoise-borne, dragon-crowned stele was early adopted by China's northern neighbors. The earliest extant monument of the Turkic Kaganate - the so-called \\"Bugut Stele\\" of the late 6th century from Arkhangai Province in western Mongolia with a Sogdian and (most likely) Sanskrit inscription was installed on a stone tortoise. It is now in the provincial capital, Tsetserleg. According to the Turkish researcher Cengiz Alyilmaz, it was the design of this stele that influenced the builders of the important 8th-century stelae with Old Turkic inscriptions, many of which also stood on tortoises. Among them, the most accessible one is probably Bayanchur Khan's (Eletmish Bilge Kaƒüan)'s Terhin-Gol stele (753 AD), now in the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulan Bator. Later, the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115-1234) and the Mongol Yuan dynasty erected tortoise-based monuments as well, some of which have been preserved in Russia's Ussuriysk and Mongolia's Karakorum. In Japan, this form of tortoise-supported stele is found primarily at the graves of prominent Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333) figures, especially in the city of Kamakura. Another large collection of tortoise-borne stelae, spanning 17th through 19th centuries, can be seen at the cemetery of the Tottori Domain daimy≈ç outside Tottori. Otherwise, the form does not seem to have been particularly popular in earlier or later times. In Korea, tortoise- borne stelae are known during the Three Kingdoms of Korea period (e.g., the Tombstone of King Muyeol of Silla, erected 661). Monuments of this type have been preserved from the later Goryeo dynasty as well, such as the Stele of Bongseon Honggyeongsa (1026). Vietnam also has a long tradition of tortoise- born stelae, where they commemorate emperor L√™ L·ª£i as well as the graduates of the Confucian academy at Hanoi's Temple of Literature. While there is no indigenous tradition of erecting stelae on tortoise-shaped pedestals in the United States, a Qing period bixi can be seen on campus of the Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This bixi was given as a gift to Harvard in 1936 by the members of Harvard Clubs in China; an appropriate text was carved for the occasion on the tablet carried by the tortoise. Isha Yoga Center Development as an art form According to Victor Segalen's assessment, the early (Han and the Six Dynasties) stone tortoises were artistic images of quite real aquatic turtles. The creatures looked quite realistic through the Song dynasty, when huge tortoise pedestals, such as the ones in Shou Qiu near Qufu, or the one in Dai Miao at Mount Tai were erected. The early-Ming specimens, while still definitely chelonian, had sprouted small ears; sides of their heads and their carapaces are often decorated by a leaf- like design. They usually have prominent teeth, which real-life turtles don't. By the mid-Qing (the 18th century), however, the stele-bearing tortoise becomes the characteristic dragon-headed bixi.

File:Bixi Lingyin.jpgThe bixi at Lingyin Temple, Hangzhou, with the characters \\"Lingyin\\" () written on the stele. According to some 19th-century western authors, the Chinese tradition of using a tortoise as a pedestal may have a common source with the Indian legend of the world being held up by a giant turtle.. Mayers is also quoted in: Name The word bi or bixi (also written with a variant character, ) is translated by Chinese dictionaries as \\"strong\\", \\"capable to support great weight\\". The word bixi is attested already in Zhang Heng's (78-139) \\"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\\" (Xi Jing Fu), which mentions \\"the great strides\\" of the giant divine bixi.\\". Quoted also in Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008) Zhang Heng's follower Zuo Si (250 - 305) in his Wu Capital Rhapsody (Wu Jing Fu) explicitly associates the attribute bixi with the legendary giant turtle ao, whose head supports a sacred mountain. (Giant Ao bixi [i.e. 'mighty'], [his] head holds up a sacred mountain). Quoted also in Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008) The term bixi became associated with the stele-carrying tortoises no later than the Ming dynasty. The terminology, however, did not immediately become stable. The earliest known Ming-era list of fantastic creatures appearing in architecture and applied art is given by Lu Rong (1436‚Äì1494) in his Miscellaneous records from the bean garden (, Shuyuan zaji). The bixi, with the syllables swapped (, xibi), appears in the first position in that list: > The xibi looks like a tortoise. By its nature it likes to carry heavy > weights. It used to be employed to support stone tablets.Lu Rong's Shuyuan > zaji as quoted in Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008): \\"\\". > The full text of Shuyuan zaji can be found at a number of sites online, e.g. Lu Rong claims that his list (including the total of 14 creatures) is based on the ancient books of beasts and supernatural creatures, the Shan Hai Jing and the Bo Wu Zhi (); however, as the modern researchers Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong note, that is not the case, and the names, much more likely, were taken by Lu Rong from the folklore of his times.Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008) Soon after Lu Rong, the mighty tablet-carrying tortoise appears in various lists of the \\"Nine children of the Dragons\\", compiled by several Ming authors. However, both Li Dongyang (1441‚Äì1516) in his Huai Lu Tang Ji and Xie Zhaozhe (, 1567‚Äì1624) in his Wu Za Zu (, Five Assorted Offerings, ca. 1592), refer to the tortoise that carries the stele by the name baxia (), rather than bixi; at the same time they apply the name bixi to the \\"literature-loving\\" dragons that appear on the sides of the stele: > The baxia has an innate love for carrying weights; the creature [that] now > [is] under tablets is its image. ... The bixi has an innate love for > literature; the dragons [that] now [are] on the sides of tablets are its > image.Li Dongyang's Huai Lu Tang Ji () quoted in Yang Jingrong and Liu > Zhixiong (2008): \\"\\" The name bixi, however, is given to the table-carrying tortoise in the more popular version of the list of the \\"Nine Children of the Dragon\\". In this form of the list, given e.g. by Yang Shen (1488‚Äì1559), the bixi is given the first position: > The bixi looks like a tortoise, and likes to carry heavy weights; [he] is > the tortoise-carrier (guifu) now [seen] under stone tablets.Yang Shen's > Sheng'an Ji () quoted in Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008): \\"\\" Stone tortoises in art and popular lore The great stone tortoises, whose antiquity sometimes went farther into the history than anyone could remember, often made impression on people who saw them, and excited their curiosity. It is said that an old legend of the stone tortoise made by Lu Ban that went to swim in the ocean every summer, and came back to its seaside hill in the fall, inspired Lu Ji's lines: . The legend, and the reference to Lu Ji, comes from the book Shu Yi Ji (, \\"Extraordinary stories\\"), commonly ascribed to Ren Fang (460‚Äî508). The story from the tortoise from a seaside hill (), as well as the one about another sea-going stone turtle from Linyi County (), and their translations to Modern Standard Mandarin, can be found at . Lu Ji's poem: Unlike modern Chinese editions, has (to die) instead of (to forget), which changes the meaning of the second line to \\"I'd rather die in my home village.\\" The opening chapter of the 14th-century novel Water Margin involves Marshal Hong releasing 108 spirits imprisoned under an ancient stele-bearing tortoise. , which includes the English translation of the relevant excerpt from the novel. The original text of the chapter can be seen e.g. at , starting from \\"...\\" A bixi plays a key role in a ghost story, \\"The Spirit of the Stone Tortoise\\" (, Bixi jing), from Yuan Mei's (1716‚Äì1797) collection What the Master does not Speak of.Jennifer Thome, STRANGE OVERTONES: THE EXPRESSIONS OF RESENTMENT AND COMPASSION IN YUAN MEI‚ÄôS WHAT THE MASTER DOES NOT SPEAK OF . M.A. thesis, Arizona State University, 2008. The French poet and researcher Victor Segalen (1878‚Äì1919), who published both a scholarly book about China's stelae and a book of poetry-in-prose about them, was also impressed by the \\"truly emblematic\\" stone tortoises, their \\"firm gestures and elegiac posture\\". Today, the image of the bixi continues to inspire modern Chinese artists.Qiu Zhijie, \\"City of failure\\" - the print is based on the Sifangcheng pavilion in the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Preservation concerns As with other stone (particularly, marble and limestone) statuary, bixi turtles and their stelae are vulnerable to acid rain (or, in winter, acid snow). On the Harvard University campus, the curators of its turtle protect it against the \\"acid snow\\" by wrapping it with a waterproof cover for the winter. A more bixi- specific concern is the wear to the creatures' noses from the people who touch them for good luck. At Hanoi's Temple of Literature, highly popular with visitors, this has become a sufficient concern to the site's managers as to make them develop plans for introducing creative landscaping and structural obstacles to keep visitors from touching the temple's 82 stone turtles.The custom of rubbing bixi for good luck (or protection from bad luck) is attested in: NotesSee also * Tortoise stelae in the Temples of Confucius and Yan Hui in Qufu - twenty-five bixi from the Temple of Confucius and Temple of Yan Hui in Qufu, from five dynasties, from Song to Qing. * Turtle-shell tombs * Chinese dragon References * (Posthumous publication, based on research done in 1909-1917) * Includes Segalen's original text and the English translation Timothy James Billings and Christopher Bush.

First used on Digital UNIX as a way to \\"funnel\\" device driver execution onto a single processor, funnels are now used in the Mac OS X kernel to serialize access to the BSD portion of xnu. Singh 07, pp. 1223-1229 A funnel is a mutual exclusion (mutex) mechanism that prevents more than one thread from accessing certain kernel resources at the same time. Each thread acquires a funnel when it enters a synchronized portion of the kernel, and releases it when it leaves. If a thread blocks (sleeps) while holding a funnel, the kernel forces the thread to automatically drop the funnel, thereby allowing other threads to enter the synchronized portion of the kernel. Because a funnel is automatically dropped when a thread blocks, care must be taken to ensure that synchronized resources are acquired again after any blocking operation. Specifically, acquiring a funnel can be a blocking operation, so if multiple funnels are needed, they must be acquired at once. This limits the utility of funnels because it increases the granularity of locking when multiple funnels need to be held at once.  In Mac OS X  There is only one funnel in OS X 10.4 and higher. Prior to version 10.4, there are two funnels: one protects network resources, and the other protects other BSD kernel resources. A thread was only allowed to hold one funnel at a time, and holding both would cause a kernel panic. As a result of these limitations and the lack of granularity, funnels are being phased out of Mac OS X. For example, the networking funnel has been replaced by finer- grained locking mechanisms.

In December 2012, the library shortened its name from Richland County Public Library. It has 11 branches including its Main Library. In 2001, it was named the National Library of the Year by the Library Journal and the Gale Group. History The library began as a private charity in 1896. In 1924 the City of Columbia took over the operation and financing of the library, and the Columbia Public Library was born. Having been housed in a number of storefront locations, in 1929 the library moved into the former home of Dr James Woodrow, the uncle of President Woodrow Wilson. The library added a bookmobile, and a Phillis Wheatley branch in the African-American neighborhood of Waverly in 1930. In 1933 Richland County began financing the library, and in 1934 the South Carolina General Assembly approved the takeover, so the name was changed to Richland County Public Library. The library was granted nonprofit status in 1982. In 1986, the RCPL, together with the University of South Carolina, began an annual event, \\"A(ugusta) Baker's Dozen: A Celebration of Stories\\" in honor of Augusta Braxton Baker, a pioneering children's librarian originally with the New York Public Library. Over the decades the library added branches, and by 1989 had outgrown its main branch. On February 14 of that year, that voters of Richland County approved a $27 million bond referendum. Exactly four years later the new Main Library opened at 1431 Assembly Street. The project had been shepherded by C. David Warren, library director since 1979. The remainder of the bond proceeds were used for other improvements, including the addition of seven new branch buildings. In 2001, the Library Journal and the Gale Group named Richland County Public Library the National Library of the Year. Main Library Main Library facade Costing $11.6 million, the four story, Main Library, designed by architect Eugene Aubry, was the chief reason for the bond issue. Aside from the striking exterior, the Children's Room, which is located in the building's basement, has a mural of characters from Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. This is the only place in the world where Sendak approved such use of his work.

The house and lot were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, by which time St. John was living in a separate small cottage to the rear of the lot. The craftsmanship orientation of the period can also be seen in the landscaping, in particular the integration of the bluestone steps up to the front porch, the lava rock foundation, and the natural rock outcrop on which the house sits. The spacious porch wraps around the right side of the house, balanced by a gable-roofed wing on the left. The rest of the house has a shingled hip roof. Finely crafted exposed rafters embellish both the hip and gable roofs, decorative shingle patterns adorn the exterior walls, windows, and porch columns, and a simple balustrade lines the porch. Two sets of double doors lead from the porch into the interior, with bedrooms and bath on the left and a large open living and dining area on the right, with paneled walls and coffered ceilings. The kitchen is off the dining area to the right, and a basement originally served as a maid's quarters. The attic was partly finished and two dormers were added by St. John during the 1930s.

A proposed bride for her first cousin Louis XIV of France, she later married Ranuccio Farnese, son of the late Odoardo Farnese and Margherita de' Medici. She died in childbirth in 1663. Biography Margherita Violante was the fifth child born to Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy and his wife Christine Marie of France, daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici. She was born at the Castello del Valentino in the Duchy of Savoy which had been ruled by her family since 1416. Her father died in October 1637, when she was just two years old. As such, her oldest surviving brother Prince Francis Hyacinth succeeded as Duke of Savoy. Her mother was thus Regent of Savoy. Margherita Violante grew up at a time when her two uncles Prince Maurice and his younger brother Prince Thomas of Savoy disputed the power of their sister-in-law, and her French entourage. The first of her siblings to marry was her eldest sister Princess Luisa Cristina who was married their uncle Maurice of Savoy in 1642. Her younger sister, Henriette Adelaide of Savoy married in 1650 to Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria. Margherita Violante's mother the French born Christine Marie started communicating with France in order to secure a marriage between Margherita Violante and the young Louis XIV of France, first cousin of Margherita Violante; Louis XIV's father Louis XIII was the oldest brother of Christine Marie. Margherita Violante was in competition with the Spanish court who had presented the Infanta Maria Teresa of Austria as another proposed bride. Maria Teresa was a daughter of Elisabeth of France, another sister of Louis XIII and Christine. Maria Teresa's father Philip IV of Spain was also the brother of Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV and was eager to bring about peace between France and Spain with the marriage of Louis and Maria Teresa. Negotiations with France and Savoy went as far as Louis XIV and Margherita Violante, known to the French as Marguerite Yolande de Savoie, meeting at Lyon on the French royal family leaving Paris on October 26, 1658. The French entourage included the Dowager Queen, Louis XIV, Philippe d'Anjou, la Grande Mademoiselle and Marie Mancini.At this point it was well known that Louis harboured a great passion for Marie much to the dislike of the Dowager Queen The French were impressed by her appearance despite saying her skin was too tanned. They also said she was a quiet girl. Upon hearing of this meeting at Lyon, Philip IV is said to have said the marriage would not happen.. Prior to the proposed Franco-Savoyard match, Antoine Pimentel marquis de T√°bara, Spanish ambassador had had secret talks with Cardinal Mazarin which later led the French to say to the Savoyard's ...the Savoyard marriage is not for the King of France, Philip IV King of Spain proposes his daughter, the Infanta Maria Teresa who has all the qualities of being the wife of Louis XIV...¬´ ...le mariage savoyard n‚Äôest pas digne du roi de France, Philippe IV roi d‚ÄôEspagne propose sa fille, l‚Äôinfante Marie-Th√©r√®se qui a toutes les qualit√©s pour devenir l‚Äô√©pouse de Louis XIV... ¬ª. The match, great for Savoy, was never to be; Louis XIV married Maria Teresa, the two were the parents of le Grand Dauphin. Margherita Violante herself would remain unmarried till 1660. Her chosen husband would be the reigning Duke of Parma Ranuccio Farnese. The two would marry in Turin on 29 April 1660. The couple had two children who both died; the first was a stillborn daughter; the second was a son who live only one day. Margherita Violante and her husband started to reconstruct the Ducal Palace of Colorno, the main residence of the Ducal family. It was at the Ducal Palace that she died giving birth to her second son. She was buried at the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata in the centre of Parma. After her death, her husband married two princesses of Modena Isabella d'Este (1635‚Äì1666) and then her sister Maria d'Este. The only surviving child of Isabella was Odoardo Farnese, father of the future Elisabeth Farnese, Queen of Spain. The son born to Maria Francesco Farnese, later Duke of Parma, continued the work at Colorno dying in 1727.

Its traditional cuisine of each area has individual traits. Staple food Dried reindeer meat Traditionally, the cuisine of S√°pmi has been based on local materials, like fish, game, reindeer and berries. Berries have been important food, because other kinds of fruits or vegetables were not available during the long winters. Nowadays berries are parts of delicate sauces and desserts. The most valued berry of S√°pmi is the cloudberry. Milk consumption varied among groups of Sami, but was not very common in general. In eastern parts of S√°pmi, reindeer herding became a way of life in the 19th century and, before that, people were hunters and fishers. These days reindeer is essential for Sami cuisine, but game, fish and wild birds are also important. The cuisine of S√°pmi consists of a variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate. Meat dishes Reindeer, fish and game meats are staple foods, with thousands of recipes and flavors, although spices other than salt are very rare. The local cuisine varies a lot, depending on access to food. S√°pmi's history with its many cultural influences has led to an array of dishes. Most dishes are made of reindeer meat, although some also are made of moose or sheep. Smoking and drying have historically been used to preserve meat and fish. Fish dishes Fishes in the mountains and forest areas of S√°pmi include Salmon, Common whitefish, Perch, Roach, and Char. Fishes of the coastal areas of S√°pmi include Cod. New cooking In the last decades new influences have been introduced in traditional Sami cooking. A well-known dish of this cross-cooking is the Suovaskebab, which consists of sliced suovasbierggo, cucumber, salad and garlic dressing in a pita bread. The Suovaskebab can be found at festivals and fairs in northern Scandinavia. These days the old food culture is evolving and adapting. Fast food restaurants in S√°pmi can have reindeer hamburger on their menus.

The text is classified as a Vaishnava Upanishad. The text exists in three main versions. One version with 64 chapters is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda in several South Indian anthologies, and the same text in Andhra edition exists in an expanded form with 80 chapters attached to the same Veda. A second version is attached to the Atharvaveda, has 25 chapters and is prefixed with Tripadvibhuti.Deussen, p.248. Also, Bloomfield Concordance, Preface. Both cite Jacob 1888. These manuscripts are sometimes titled as the Yajniki Upanishad or Tripad-vibhuti-mahanarayana Upanishad. According to Swami Vimalananda, this Upanishad is also called Yagniki Upanishad in reverence for sage Yagnatma Narayana. The Upanishad, despite its title which means \\"Great Narayana\\",Mahanaraya, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany (2012) is notable for glorifying both Narayana and Rudra (Shiva), both as the first equivalent embodiment of Brahman, the concept of ultimate, impersonal and transcendental reality in Hinduism. The Upanishad uses Vedanta terminology, and uses numerous fragments from Rigveda, Taittiriya Brahmana, Vajasaneyi Samhita and Principal Upanishads. When doing sandhyavandanam, the mantras used for PrƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma, MantrƒÅcamana, GƒÅyatrƒ´ ƒÅhvƒÅnam, DevatƒÅnamaskƒÅra·∏• and GƒÅyatrƒ´ PrasthƒÅnam are directly from Mahanarayana Upanishad (Andhra rescension containing 80 anuvakas). History The author and the century in which the Mahanarayana Upanishad was composed is unknown. The relative chronology of the text, based on its poetic verse and textual style, has been proposed by Parmeshwaranand to the same period of composition as Katha, Isha, Mundaka and Shvetashvatara Upanishads, but before Maitri, Prashna and Mandukya Upanishad. Feuerstein places the relative composition chronology of Mahanarayana to be about that of Mundaka and Prashna Upanishads. These relative chronology estimates date the text to second half of 1st millennium BCE. Srinivasan suggests a later date, one after about 300 BCE and by around the start of the common era, probably 1st century CE, based on the texts it cites and the comparison of details of the Samdhya ritual found in Mahanarayana Upanishad with those found in other Sutras and Shastras. Deussen considers it to be ancient and a transitional link between the Upanishads of the three Vedas (Rig, Sama and Yajur) and the Atharvaveda. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Mahanaryanopanishad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 291, 495‚Äì496 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed as Tripadvibhutimahanarayana Upanishad at number 52. It is different from the shorter version of Narayana Upanishad of the Atharva Veda. The tenth chapter of the Taittiriya Upanishad is adopted in this Mahanarayana text. The Mahanarayana Upanishad was among the text included in the collection of fifty Upanishads translated into Persian by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, under the title Maha-narain, and listed at 30 in the compilation called the Oupanekhat. In the Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in North India, it is listed at 39‚Äì40 as Brhadnarayana. In the Narayana anthology, popular in South India, it is included at number 34 as Mahanarayana or Brhadnarayana in Bibliothica Indica. Even though Adi Shankara did not directly comment on this Upanishad, his commentary on Brahmasutras such as at III.3.24 applies to this text, since some of the Vedanta sutras are incorporated in this Upanishad. Contents The text opens with cosmology, with a verse describing the Brahman principle as existent before the creation of universe, which existed as and in light in the \\"boundless cosmic water\\". The style of its opening verses suggest that the metaphysical principle of Brahman was well established by the time this text was composed. It is described as that where and from which the world originated and into which it shall disintegrate, upon whom all the gods are founded, it is that which was past and what will be, it is all parts of time, it is that which envelops the entire universe, which procreates and is present in all creatures, mobile and immobile, and that which is in Om. It is highest of the highest, greatest of the greatest, it is the law, it is the truth, it is the Brahman. The text calls this metaphysical principle as Agni (fire), Vayu (wind), Surya (sun), Chandrama (moon), Prajapati, Purusha, Rudra and Narayana, that they are all none other than Brahman. It is that, states verse 10.19 which was already there before the gods appeared. The text extracts, repeats and integrates the hymns from the Vedic texts. For example, its first ten chapters reference and include hymn fragments or entire hymns from Rigveda 1.18, 1.22, 1.164, 2.3, 4.58, 5.82, 9.96 and 10.81, Yajurveda 32.1 through 32.4, Atharvaveda 10.8.13, section 6.9 of Katha Upanishad, 4.2 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, 2.1 of Mundaka Upanishad and others. The chapter 2 of the text gives, for example, an elaborate version of the Rigvedic Gayatri mantra. Narayana is particularly solemnized in the 11th chapter of the text, calling Atman (soul) as Narayana. This description mirrors those found in Yogashikha Upanishad and Yogatattva Upanishad. Narayana is described as the highest goal, the light beyond, the highest self, the highest Brahman, the highest object of thought. The chapter 12 and twenty six verses that follow then solemnize Rudra, in a manner similar to Narayana, as being all the universe, the manifest One, the right, the just, the truth and the highest Brahman. Once again, the text references and integrates numerous hymns and their fragments from the Vedas, as it solemnizes Narayana and Rudra. The Upanishad describes its axiology, describing the highest principles of human endeavor to be satyam (truth), tapas (penance), dama (temperance, self restraints), sama (quietude, stillness of the forest), danam (charity), dharmam (duty), prajanam (having children), agnihotram (sacred domestic fire), yajna (fire ritual), manasam (mind's contemplation), nyasa (renunciation, sannyasa). It then declares renunciation as the exquisite among these, possibly because this text is followed by the Sannyasa Upanishads in the Atharvaveda. The discussion of human virtues and value systems is carried in two parts of the Upanishad, once in chapter 8 and then again in chapters 62 and 63, but explained with different details. The last chapter of the text, in different versions of the manuscript is a poem of reverence for those who renounce for their journey of knowledge, metrically describing how the life of this sannyasi (monk) is an act of worship in itself. He is a man of knowledge, asserts the Upanishad, whose faith is his wife, whose body is the sacred fuel, his chest is the sacrificial place, his tuft of hair is his sacrificial broom, his love is the sacred ghee (clarified butter), his speech is the Hotr priest, his breath is the Udgatr priest, his eyes are the Adhvaryu priest, his mind the object of his worship, his knowledge is his sacrifice. This chapter of the Mahanarayana Upanishad has been called by the French Indologist Jean Varenne as a Sannyasa Upanishad by itself. The text is notable for using the word Nyasa with, states Patrick Olivelle, a meaning approximating Sannyasa (Yati, Bhikshu, Hindu Monk).

KG; Biotronik Worldwide) is a privately held multinational biomedical technology company headquartered in Berlin, Germany. The company offers equipment for diagnosis, treatment, and therapy support in the areas of cardiac rhythm management, electrophysiology and vascular intervention. In the area of cardiac rhythm management, Biotronik Home Monitoring¬Æ uses telemonitoring technology to provide doctors with up-to-date information for implant patients. Biotronik employs more than 9,000 people worldwide in over 100 countries, with research and development activities in Europe, North America and Singapore. It produces all critical components of its products in-house. One in every five employees at Berlin headquarters works in research and development (R&D;). History BIOTRONIK began with the development of the first German implantable pacemaker (Biotronik IP-03) in 1963. The pacemaker was developed at the Technical University of Berlin by physicist Max Schaldach (1936‚Äì2001), a professor of biomedical technology at the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) and electrical engineer Otto Franke. In the early years, the company worked to improve pacemakers' capacity and battery life and secure the connections among electrodes, pacemakers, and the heart. Since its start, more than 19 million BIOTRONIK devices in over 100 countries have been implanted. In 1976, the company moved to Sieversufer 8 in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln. In 1979, a US production site in Lake Oswego, Oregon was built. This subsidiary resulted from the acquisition of the American pacemaker producer Stimulation Technology, Inc. At the same time, with the development and production of advanced hybrid circuitry and structural components for the medical technology industry, the company also began to develop circuits for pacemakers. In the 1980s, the dual- chamber stimulation method (DDD) was developed, leading to the manufacturing of a pacemaker that could read and react to spontaneous contractions of the atrium and better respond to them of its own accord. To this end, BIOTRONIK developed the Diplos 03, a multi-program DDD pacemaker with bilateral telemetry, which made it a European market leader and increased its presence in South America and Asia. In 1987, the firm moved its headquarters to Woermannkehre 1, next door to its previous location. In 1993, BIOTRONIK produced the first German implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), among them the Phylax 06. Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS), which integrates the pacemaker into the body's own regulatory system, thereby allowing it to react to patients‚Äô changing physical and emotional activity, was introduced in the 1990s. Also in 1993, BIOTRONIK developed fractal coating for implantable electrodes. This coating optimizes the electrically active surface of the electrode, thereby improving its perception and stimulation properties. BIOTRONIK remains the only manufacturer of fractal-coated electrodes. In 1994 and 1995 respectively, BIOTRONIK began offering a full spectrum of electrophysiology products and vascular intervention products. BIOTRONIK also develops and produces balloon catheters and stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease. With Philos, the company has offered a complete pacemaker family with telemetry since 2000, when it received CE Mark approval for the product and also successfully implanted the first pacemaker with Home Monitoring (remote patient monitoring). Home Monitoring has shown significant clinical benefits, including over a 50% reduction in mortality of heart failure patients. With the Lumax 540 VR-T DX in 2010, BIOTRONIK launched the first and only single-chamber defibrillator with comprehensive atrial diagnostics worldwide. Additionally, the company entered into an exclusive international distribution partnership with the Swiss medical technology company Endosense to distribute their ablation catheter TactiCath with optical contact force. The following year, BIOTRONIK released Orsiro to the market‚Äîthe world's first hybrid drug-eluting stent with a bio-absorbable coating, adding to innovative treatment options combatting coronary artery disease. In 2011, BIOTRONIK was the subject of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into payments made to doctors in Nevada, United States who use the company's products in their practices. The case was settled in 2014. In 2013, a similar investigation began and was settled involving payments to physicians in Oregon. In 2012, the company acquired the old Postfuhramt, a historical brick postal building on Berlin's Oranienburger Strasse in the district of Mitte. The following year, BIOTRONIK launched BioMonitor, a type of mini ECG device that offers continuous monitoring and daily remote data collection. In addition, BIOTRONIK also developed the world's first series of implantable defibrillators that enable patients, including those suffering heart failure, to undergo MRI scans under certain conditions. BIOTRONIK's ProMRI¬Æ technology includes systems approved for 1.5 T and 3.0 T MR scanning, as well as full- body scanning. The company offers the broadest portfolio of pacemakers, defibrillators and therapies approved to undergo MRIs, with more than 1,000,000 ProMRI¬Æ devices and leads implanted worldwide. To navigate through this portfolio, BIOTRONIK invented two online tools in 2016 and 2017‚Äîthe ProMRI¬ÆSystemCheck and ProMRI¬ÆConfigurator, correspondingly. For radiation protection, BIOTRONIK distributes the Zero-Gravity Radiation Protection System, which consists of a movable suspended body and head shield. The shield material has a significantly higher lead equivalency than traditional radiation apparel, thereby reducing radiation exposure by 87‚Äì100%. Indicated to treat peripheral artery disease in the lower limbs, BIOTRONIK released the Passeo-18 Lux in 2014 as the first peripheral drug-coated balloon. The year following, CardioMessenger Smart was launched, its new patient device for Home Monitoring, and BioMonitor 2, the second-generation insertable cardiac monitor. In February 2016, BIOTRONIK Inc. opened an Education and Innovation Center, a training facility and meeting location in New York City. Awards In 2007, BIOTRONIK was given the EuroPCR 2007 Novelty Award for its innovative absorbable metal stents (AMS) by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI). In 2009, it was nominated for the German Future Prize for its Home Monitoring system by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. In 2010, BIOTRONIK endowed the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities' Technical Science Prize, first awarded to Till Schl√∂sser. The CARDIOSTIM Innovation Award for Practice Improvement was granted to BIOTRONIK for its MRI AutoDetect. Partnerships BIOTRONIK partners with the EPIC Alliance, a global network of female electrophysiologists, in aims to increase collaboration and support for women in the field of electrophysiology.

Sir Daniel Ford Goddard PC JP (17 January 1850 ‚Äì 6 May 1922) was a British civil engineer, businessman and Liberal Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich from 1895 to 1918. He was also Mayor of Ipswich from 1891‚Äì92. Background Goddard was the son of Ebenezer Goddard, C.E., J.P., of Ipswich, Suffolk, and his wife Annie, n√©e Ford. He was educated privately at Ipswich and then at Hastings under Dr Martin Reed.Dod's Parliamentary Companion, 1907 He married Lucy Corsbie in 1874. She died in 1875, and in 1877 he married Elizabeth Harwood. Both his father and grandfather occupied the post of engineer for the Ipswich Gas Company. Professional career In 1867 Goddard was articled to Messrs E. R. and J. Turner, engineers, Ipswich. He was an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He studied Chemistry with Professors Sibson and Heisch in London and Newcastle. He worked as an Assistant Engineer from 1872-77The Liberal Year Book, 1907 and then succeeded his father as Engineer and Secretary of the Ipswich Gas Company from 1877‚Äì87. He was a director of several companies. He was Chairman of Directors for the Ipswich Gas Company from 1887.(2007, December 01). Goddard, Rt Hon.

In 1896 he founded and built the Ipswich Social Settlement.Debrett's House of Commons and Judicial Bench, 1916 Political career Sir Daniel Ford Goddard c.1911 Goddard was first elected to Ipswich Borough Council in 1886 serving until 1895. He was appointed an alderman of Ipswich in 1895, and served as the town's mayor from 1891 to 1892. In 1892 he was appointed as a Justice of the peace for Ipswich. At the 1892 general election, he stood for Parliament as one of two Liberal candidates in the dual member constituency of Ipswich. He stood in tandem with Arthur Soames. The Liberals had not won Ipswich since 1885. They failed to dislodge either of Ipswich's two Conservative MPs. He won the seat in 1895. Unsurprisingly, as a local man and former city mayor, Goddard polled 167 votes more than his running mate, Soames. Three years later, Goddard and Soames had another opportunity to unseat the Conservatives at the 1895 general election. Goddard was successful, topping the poll, but Soames was third, 43 votes behind the leading Conservative. At the 1900 general election, Goddard sought re-election and this time had a new Liberal running mate in Noel Buxton. Goddard again topped the poll but again, the sitting Conservative MP came second ahead of Buxton. For the 1906 general election, Goddard stood again as Liberal candidate and again with a new Liberal running mate in Felix Cobbold. Unlike Soames and Buxton, Cobbold had stronger ties to Ipswich, making him a better fit as candidate. Goddard and Cobbold were both easily elected in the year of the Liberal landslide. Once again, Goddard topped the poll.

It was used by ritual processions ascending from the pool to the Temple, Judaism's holiest site. The stepped street was built during the governorship of Pontius Pilate of New Testament fame. History In ancient times, in the celebration called Simchat Beit HaShoeivah, water was carried up from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple. Description The street went from Jerusalem's southern gates, along the ancient City of David, today part of the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan, into what is now the Old City and passed by the Western Wall after passing underneath the Herodian bridge now known as Robinson's Arch. The ancient path was improved and paved in large, well-cut stone in the pattern of two steps followed by a long landing, followed by two more steps and another landing. The street was eight meters wide and its length from the Pool to the Temple Mount is 600 meters. A large drainage channel ran below street. Interpretation According to archaeologist Ronny Reich, who for several years led the dig uncovering the ancient street together with archaeologist Eli Shukron, pilgrims used the Pool of Siloam as a mikveh for ritual purification before walking up the street to the Temple. However, Professor Elitzur opposes this interpretation and argues that the Pool of Siloam was a typical Roman public swimming pool. Excavation history Sections of the ancient street were first discovered by Charles Warren in 1884, followed by Bliss and Dickey of the Palestine Exploration Fund between 1894 and 1897. The find was reburied when their excavation concluded. Other sections were uncovered, then reburied, by later archaeologists, Jones in 1937 and Kathleen Kenyon in 1961‚Äì1967.Second Temple Period Street Discovered, at gojerusalem.com More details about the street were published by Benjamin Mazar in 1969-1971, followed by Ronny Reich (alone or in collaboration with Yakov Billig, then Eli Shukron) between 1999-2011 (including findings from the drainage channel running beneath the street), and Eilat Mazar in 2000. According to Israeli archaeologists, the street was rediscovered during excavations on a water channel from the Second Temple period.

It was formerly a part of Prince property and was named after its owner. Shifting ownership of the manor In the 16th century, the manor was passed from the Sapieha family to the Pac family, then to Danielewicz of Ostoja coat of arms. In 1742, Franciszek Danielewicz sold all the Bohdanow properties to his clan brother (Clan of Ostoja) Tomasz Lachowiecki-Czechowicz of Ostoja coat of arms and his wife Barbara Sulistrowska. Bohdanow was owned by the Czechowicz family until 1836 when part of the Bohdanow property, mainly Bohdanow with the Manor houses, was sold to Ferdynand Ruszczyc of Lis coat of arms. During that time Czechowicz raised several buildings on the property, created a park, and raised beavers. Ferdynand Ruszczyc and his wife Anna Czechowicz developed the property further. They tended the property well, and conserved the wooden church on the property built during its ownership by the Pac family. The grandson of Ferdinand Ruszczyc was also given the name Ferdynand and he was the one to continue managing the property doing conservation work on the property.

The Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires was one of the most important institutions of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, along with the viceroy, the Cabildo and the religious ones. The Consulate was set up in 1794 at the request of local merchants. It was a collegial body which functioned as a commercial court (called the Court) and as a society of economic development (called Governing Board). The Consulate was directly under command of the Spanish Crown, and it was directly governed by the rules dictated by the House of Trade in Seville. It was largely a guild of merchants with powers delegated by the king in trade matters. It could settle lawsuits and claims brought by merchants and was financed by levying taxes. With the passing of the years it would increase the power of control over customs. The Secretary of the Consulate was required to propose annually, through the reading of a Consular Report, ways to promote agriculture, encourage industry and protect the commerce of the region. Manuel Belgrano, Secretary of the Embassy since its inception, set for himself the goal to transform a poor and virgin region into a rich and prosperous one. Manuel Belgrano and the Consulate The first and only Secretary of the Consulate, Manuel Belgrano, had to play with caution in assuming the leadership of that task the 3 June, 1794. Having been designated as perpetual secretary of the consulate, he wrote the guidelines that would follow in its efforts of economic development, in a document which has survived. The ideals of the Consulate and what could be achieved for the benefit of the viceroyalty, however, were far from desired. He did not adopt a position of outright opposition, but a tone of education, which included frequent praise and prostrations to the king and the authorities. The criticism was always, therefore, about the contrast between the situation he complained about (apparently without accusing any person or body) and what the authorities had not done to ensure general welfare, making them therefore guilty of neglect or inaction. The date on which Belgrano became leader, 3 June, was named Economist day in Buenos Aires in 2003.

Migration history In early 1989, tensions arose between Mauritania and Senegal due to conflicts over water resources in the S√©n√©gal River valley. As a result, white Mauritanian Moors in the Senegalese capital Dakar became the targets of communal violence, while in Mauritania itself, black Mauritanians came under suspicion as \\"Senegalese fifth columnists\\". To prevent further violence, the governments of Mauritania and Senegal began to organise mutual repatriations of their citizens from each other's territories in April that year; however, Mauritania did not just remove Senegalese citizens, but an estimated 70,000 black Mauritanians as well. Those expelled were largely of Halpuular ethnicity. The border between the two countries would not be reopened until April 1992. Repatriation began slowly after the reopening of the border. Refugees returning to Trarza and Brakna generally found conditions to be good, but those going back to Gorgol and Guidimaka complained of continued discrimination by local authorities. Reports in early 2013 indicated that returnees continued to face difficulties resettling in their former villages and regaining access to the lands they had once farmed due to their lack of identification documents.

Only pilots may initiate a request for this type of approach, as regulations prohibit air traffic control (ATC) from asking pilots to perform them. A contact approach will only be issued if the aircraft is operating clear of clouds with at least 1-mile of flight visibility, with a reasonable expectation of continuing to the destination airport under those conditions. Additionally, the reported ground visibility at the destination airport must be at least 1 statute mile. In the execution of a contact approach, the pilot is responsible for obstruction clearance, but ATC will still provide separation from other IFR or Special VFR traffic. If radar service is being received, it will automatically terminate when the pilot is instructed to change to the airport's advisory frequency. The pilot must advise ATC immediately if unable to continue the contact approach or if they encounter less than 1-mile flight visibility; new instructions will then be provided by ATC. Also, ATC may issue alternative instructions if, in their judgment, weather conditions may make completion of the approach impracticable. The contact approach is often used as time- and fuel-savings method of working the air traffic control system to a pilot's advantage. However, this shortcut comes with two important warnings: # It is essentially a legalized form of scud-running, a potentially very dangerous practice. # It works safely only if the pilot is completely familiar with local terrain. Thus, most instrument pilots will not fly them as they can be scary for the inexperienced. The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), emphasizes that the contact approach is meant only as a substitute for a standard IAP. It is not intended to be used as a \\"poor man's\\" IFR approach to an airport not having a published approach procedure, nor is it to be used to approach one airport, break-off the approach in visual conditions, and then fly to another airport.

It fought mostly with the Army of Northern Virginia. The 32nd Virginia was formed in May, 1861, by consolidating Montague's and Goggin's Infantry Battalions. Its members were from Hampton and Williamsburg and the counties of Warwick, James City, and York. Three companies were accepted into service as artillery and were transferred to the 1st Virginia Artillery. After its reorganization in May, 1862, the unit operated with only seven companies. At the Battle of Williamsburg two companies fought under General Pryor, then the regiment was attached to General Semmes' and Corse's Brigade. It participated in many conflicts from the Seven Days' Battles to Fredericksburg, moved with Longstreet to Suffolk, and later served in the Department of Richmond and in North Carolina. Returning to Virginia it was active at Drewry's Bluff and Cold Harbor, took its place in the Petersburg trenches north and south of the James River, they saw action on the Chickahominy (May 1864), at Cold Harbor (June), on the Petersburg Campaign (to April 1865), and ended the war at Appomattox. The regiment reported 1 wounded at Savage's Station, had 2 killed and 4 wounded at Malvern Hill, and sustained 72 casualties of the 158 engaged at Sharpsburg.

Huang (; is an American biologist specialized in microbiology and virology. She is Senior Faculty Associate in Biology at the California Institute of Technology, and served as President of AAAS during the 2010-2011 term. Early years Alice Huang's father, Quentin K. Y. Huang, was orphaned at age 12 in Anhui, China and was taken in by a missionary. He was later educated at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Divinity School, returning to China as an Anglican bishop. He later married Huang's mother, Grace Betty Soong. Alice Huang‚Äôs mother, Grace Betty Soong, was from Kiangsi Province where her family had large land holdings. Grace‚Äôs father appreciated the practical work of Christian missionaries and allowed several of his children to become Christian instead of remaining Buddhist. Alice Huang was born in Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi Province, in 1939. Huang was raised Christian. Huang emigrated to the U.S. in 1949. She attended St. Mary's Hall-Doane Academy (in Burlington, New Jersey), the National Cathedral School (in Washington, D.C.), and Wellesley College (in Wellesley, Massachusetts). Huang received B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. (in microbiology in 1966) degrees all from The Johns Hopkins University. Career= Research  Alice Huang's research focused on defective interfering particles (DIPs) which can be utilized to combat viruses. DIPs are composed of viral structural proteins and sets of DNA or RNA which are incomplete.Hannon, J. (2006). Alice Huang. Alice Huang, 1. These DIPs will interfere in replication of the virus because they are reproduced at the expense of a standard viral particle. Alice Huang's work on DIPs has been utilized to combat cancer, HIV, and plant related diseases. Alice S. Huang‚Äôs passion for viruses drove her to her success in the discovery of viruses features and learning how to manipulate their development. She started studying about viruses as a graduate student, when little was known about them, where she was the first person \\"to purify and characterize interfering viral particles\\". While at Johns Hopkins University, Huang conducted research looking into the inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis by nonreplicating vesicular stomatitis virus. She completed this research with Robert R. Wagner. She thought that these mutants played a vital role in viral pathogenesis and could possibly be used to prevent disease. The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), known to infect horses, cattle and swine, was the virus she first chose to study. It did not take long for her and her colleagues to find out about its single strand of RNA and many other features about the VSV, including replication details. Their findings about the VSV served as a model for the understanding of the biology of viruses. For the research, she isolated a rabies type of virus which produced mutant strains interfering with viral growth. Later, in her work with her husband at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) she studied made ribonucleic acid (RNA) from RNA instead of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which did not follow the conventional central dogma: DNA RNA Protein. Her discovery of this VSV virion-associated RNA ‚Äì dependent RNA polymerase led to Baltimore‚Äôs research on tumor viruses and the discovery of the enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This enzyme converted RNA to DNA, and became a major breakthrough in virology. In her postdoctoral work at the Salk Institute and MIT with David Baltimore, Dr. Huang worked on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and discovered that these viruses had RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. Through this work on VSV she uncovered a mix of surface glycoproteins which resulted in a novel replication strategy for Negative Strand Viruses as well as Pseudotyping. Pseudotyping is combining a virus or a part of a virus (vector) with a foreign viral envelope protein. Doing this alters their antigenicity which allows them to have a more broad range of hosts. At the time, biologists knew the central dogma to be DNA to RNA to protein, with DNA replication as the way to replicate ones genome. Dr. Huang and Dr. Baltimore unraveled that RNA viruses were different and used RNA polymerase to replicate its RNA genome. With continued researched and publications from other researchers, along with help from Dr. Huang, Dr. Baltimore discovered an enzyme, reverse transcriptase (in a mouse leukemia retrovirus), that converts RNA to DNA (involved in a process now known as reverse transcription). Dr. Baltimore later received the Nobel Prize in 1975 for his discovery. Huang and Baltimore coauthored a paper with Martha Stampfer titled \\"Ribonucleic acid synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus, II. An RNA polymerase in the virion.\\" This paper went on to show that ‚Äúthe virions of vesicular stomatitis virus contain an enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of ribonucleotides into RNA‚Äù. At Harvard Medical School, Huang continued to study how mutant strains produced by rabies-like virus interfered with further growth of the viral infection. In 1977, she was awarded the Eli Lilly Award in Microbiology and Immunology for this research. Huang has spent more than twenty years as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School. In 1971, Huang was appointed Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Harvard Medical School, and was promoted to full Professor in 1979.  Administration  During her Harvard period, Huang was also a coordinator of the Virology Unit at the Channing Laboratories of Infectious Diseases at Boston Medical Center for two years. She also served as the Director of the \\"Virus-Host Interactions in Cancer\\" training program (funded by the National Cancer Institute) for fifteen years. Huang became the Director of the Laboratories of Infectious Diseases at Boston Children's Hospital in 1979, where she studied viral diseases in pediatric patients. Subsequently, she was the Dean of the Faculty of Science of the New York University. She spearheaded many interdisciplinary programs and was instrumental in providing vision for what is now known as Silicon Alley from the Flatiron District to Wall Street. At New York University, Dr. Huang participated in a project in science education and received a grant that focused on improving teachers‚Äô preparation and ability to engage students in science exploration and discovery. Huang is an emeritus member of the Board of Trustees of the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences (KGI). Besides, Huang also served on the Board of Trustees of the Keystone Center, Health Effects Institute, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and her alma mater Johns Hopkins University. Huang is a former trustee of the Waksman Foundation for Microbiology and a trustee of the Public Agenda. She was pointed a Council Member of the California Council on Science and Technology in 2004, and served for two terms. She currently consults on education, science, and science policy. Huang is commented as having a broad international view, and has also consulted on science policies for government agencies not only in the United States but also in several nations including Singapore, Taiwan, China, and Portugal.  Controversies  In June 2015, Huang wrote a controversial advice article for the Science Careers website. A female postdoctoral scholar asked what she should do in response to her advisor looking down her shirt. Huang replied, \\"I suggest you put up with it, with good humor if you can.\\" Following strong reaction on social media, the article was removed within hours of being posted. After the article was removed, Science Careers tweeted, \\"We apologize for printing it. It does not reflect our values or standards\\". A fuller apology claimed the article had not \\"undergone proper editorial review prior to posting.\\" In an interview, Huang stood by her advice, saying, \\"What I try to do is give advice from experience, and to give the advice that would serve the writer well into the long-term future. I‚Äôm taking their best interests to heart rather than being in one camp or another camp or trying to push my own political agendas.\\" She said she hoped to write a follow-up column with other people‚Äôs suggestions for dealing with the situation. Huang's explanation was criticized for implying that \\"being against sexual harassment is a 'camp' or political agenda.\\" Awards and honors * 1977 - Eli Lilly Award in Immunology and Microbiology (from the American Society for Microbiology) * 1982 - Doctor of Science (Honorary), Wheaton College * 1987 - Doctor of Science (Honorary), from Mount Holyoke College * 1991 - Doctor of Science (Honorary), Medical College of Pennsylvania * 1999 - Achievement Award (from the Chinese-American Faculty Association of Southern California) * 2001 - the Alice C.

With its high-frequency trading algorithms Knight was the largest trader in U.S. equities, with a market share of 17.3% on NYSE and 16.9% on NASDAQ.Knight Liquidity Statistics The company agreed to be acquired by Getco LLC in December 2012 after an August 2012 trading error lost $460 million. The merger was completed in July 2013, forming KCG Holdings. Company Knight was formerly known as Knight/Trimark Group, Inc. and Knight Trading Group, Inc. Initially, Knight Trading group had multiple offices located in the United States and in other cities around the world. Knight's Asset Management offices were headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, with offices in Hong Kong, China, and London. Activities Knight's largest business was market making in U.S. equities. Its Electronic Trading Group (ETG) covered more than 19,000 U.S. securities with an average daily trading volume of more than 21 billion dollars in May 2012. Knight also made markets in U.S. options and European equities. In 2002, Knight paid $1.5 million to settle regulatory charges of violations such as not respecting posted quotes. Knight neither admitted nor denied the allegations. In 2004, the company paid a $79 million settlement to customers whom they had overcharged. In 2008, Knight traded an average of 3.97 billion shares per day. In 2011, the company was worth $1.5 billion and employed approximately 1450 people. Offices Knight was headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. It had many offices in other US locations, as well as in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, and Singapore.[Knight Locations ] Operating subsidiaries Knight Capital Group operated in four segments: equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities, and corporate. Operating business subsidiaries included Knight Capital Americas, L.P., Knight Execution & Clearing Services LLC, Knight Capital Europe Limited and Hotspot FX Holdings, Inc.Knight Capital Group Online website. Knight Capital Group discontinued operations of its asset management segment in 2009 when its subsidiary, Deephaven Capital Management, sold most of its assets to Stark & Roth, LLC. 2012 stock trading disruption On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital caused a major stock market disruption leading to a large trading loss for the company. The incident happened after a technician forgot to copy the new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) code to one of the eight SMARS computer servers, which was Knight's automated routing system for equity orders. RLP code repurposed a flag that was formerly used to activate the old function known as 'Power Peg'. Power Peg was designed to move stock prices higher and lower in order to verify the behavior of trading algorithms in a controlled environment. Therefore, orders sent with the repurposed flag to the eighth server triggered the defective Power Peg code still present on that server. When released into production, Knight's trading activities caused a major disruption in the prices of 148 companies listed at the New York Stock Exchange. For example, shares of Wizzard Software Corporation went from $3.50 to $14.76. For the 212 incoming parent orders that were processed by the defective Power Peg code, Knight Capital sent millions of child orders, resulting in 4 million executions in 154 stocks for more than 397 million shares in approximately 45 minutes. Knight Capital took a pre-tax loss of $440 million. This caused Knight Capital's stock price to collapse, sending shares lower by over 70% from before the announcement. The nature of the Knight Capital's unusual trading activity was described as a \\"technology breakdown\\".

In October 2011, the Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History launched the first culinary tours in Palm Beach County. History The Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History was founded in 1999. Its mission is to showcase \\"lifestyle, cultures, people, places, fashion trends, clothes, architecture, furnishings, decorative arts, interior designs, locomotives and toys, and information about popular uses of artifacts by people/events of various periods of time. From 2003 to 2005 the museum located in the Pineapple Grove Plaza in the City of Delray Beach. In year 2005, the plaza was sold and demolished and the museum was homeless. From 2009 to 2012 the museum was located at the Boynton Beach Mall in the City of Boynton Beach, Florida. There were two permanent history exhibits: the Fashion Treasures exhibit showcasing fashions from the 1800s to present, and the Barbie Museum gallery chronicling the anthropological impact of this world famous doll. Barbie Museum The Barbie Museum display at the Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History included hundreds of vintage, original and collector edition Barbie dolls, her family members and friends, and clothes and accessories dating from the doll's beginning in 1959 to the present. Efforts were started in 1999 to raise monies to establish the non- profit Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History to feature a permanent gallery for the Barbie doll and the doll's popular culture history.Palm Beach Daily News article entitled: A Place To Call Home written by Robert Janjigian. December 1, 2008 issuePalm Beach Post Neighborhood Post for Delray Beach & Boynton Beach cover news stories. \\"Fashion Museum Seeks to build own space\\" written by Lina Hasse. March 14, 2007 Additionally, to complement the Barbie Museum, the Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History featured a permanent rotating small-format exhibit about fashion history from the late 1880s to present. In 1999 the idea developed for this unique museum devoted to Barbie doll history began when then 27-year-old Lori J. Durante conceived, organized and curated an exhibit entitled: \\"40 Years of the Barbie Doll: In Celebration of Women's History Month\\". Durante had worked as a fashion stylist for Boca Raton Magazine and Worth Avenue Magazine and also as a fashion writer for other publications. In 1998, Durante came up with a fashion news story idea about Barbie's 39th birthday for a news article she wrote for Jezebel Magazine. The research about the Barbie and the subsequent news story that Durante wrote inspired Durante to create an exhibit display about the doll for her 40th anniversary in 1999 to be located in Delray Beach,Florida. For this exhibit display, Mattel loaned to Lori J. Durante multi-cultural and collector edition Barbie dolls that came from the Mattel archives in California. This small-format exhibit included a showcase of dolls from both Mattel and private collectors. The Barbie doll show became a blockbuster exhibit with more than 20,000 attendees from all over the State of Florida, the U.S. and from abroad. The exhibit became the number one exhibit in all of Palm Beach County, Florida and that attendance record for a locally created exhibit has not been broken yet. Permanent Archival & Artifact Collections The Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History's permanent archival and artifact collection consists of more than 300 fashion items, clothes, accessories, household products, furnishings, decorative arts, toys and dolls, including ninety couture dresses designed by Arnold Scaasi that were given to the museum from a local historical society. The fashion collection includes clothing by Chester Weinberg, Bill Blass, Hattie Carnegie, Stetson, Lilly Pulitzer and Iris Apfel. References *4.

Their original territory was located near the city of Mecca. A number of modern-day tribes throughout the Arab world trace their lineage to the Banu Kinanah.  Geography  They live mainly in Western Arabia (western part of Saudi Arabia) called the Hedjaz region; some clans of their tribes live mainly in Sudan, Algeria, Iraq, Syria, Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, (region) and Yemen.  Early history  The tribe traces its ancestry to Ishmael, who married a woman of the Arab Jurhum tribe and settled in the vicinity of Mecca according to Islamic tradition. Both the Banu Kinanah themselves and their various branches were polytheists, with their worship centering on the goddess al-Uzza. Islamic tradition holds that the Kinanah and the other descendants of Ishmael gradually dispersed throughout northern Arabia, losing their original faith and falling into idolatry. Their eponymous ancestor is Kinanah ibn Khuzayma ibn Mudrikah ibn Ilyas. Kinanah ibn Khuzayma was also the ancestor of the people of the Quraysh , including the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Ibn Ishaq states that the Banu Kinanah and the Quraysh later reclaimed Mecca from the Banu Khuza'a tribe, which had established itself in the city. This led to the Quraysh becoming the custodians of the Kaaba.  Related tribes  Approximate locations of some of the important tribes of the Arabian Peninsula at the dawn of Islam (circa 600 CE) The early Islamic historians Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham state that Kinanah ibn Khuzayma had four sons named an-Nathr, Abd-ManƒÅt, Milkan, and Malik. The Quraysh are listed as descendants of an-Nadr. The clans of Banu Thalaba, Banu al-Harith ibn Malik, Banu Firas ibn Ghanm, Banu Mukhdadj ibn Amir, and Banu Fukaim ibn Adl are listed as descendants of Malik. The descendants of Abd-Manat include the tribes of Banu Ghifar, Banu Laith, Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat, Banu Du'il, Banu al-Harith, Banu Mudlidj, and Banu Damra ibn Bakr. While it is unlikely that these genealogies are historically accurate, they reflect the ties of kinship that these clans perceived to exist between them.  In Islamic history  Islamic historians did not note the actions of the Banu Kinanah as a united tribe in the time of Muhammad, though several of the tribe's offshoots, including the Quraysh, played pivotal roles in the formation and spread of Islam. After the Islamic conquests, some members of the tribe and its branches migrated to the newly-conquered territories, and a number of them were appointed governors of ajnad. In addition to Saudi Arabia, the Banu Kinanah are documented in Palestine and Egypt.

It is often punishable by fines or endorsements on a driver's license. It is usually a less serious offence than reckless driving (United States) or dangerous driving (United Kingdom), though more serious than driving whilst using a mobile phone. United Kingdom In England and Wales and Scotland this offence was created by section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as substituted by section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1991). It carries a punishment of between three and nine penalty points\\"Penalty points (endorsements): Removing expired endorsements from your driving record\\". GOV.UK. Accessed 25 July 2020. and a fine of up to ¬£5,000. The Road Traffic Act 1991 amended the same act to insert section 3A, which creates the offence of \\"causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs\\", punishable by up to 14 years in prison with mandatory disqualification and 3‚Äì11 penalty points. The Road Safety Act 2006 additionally inserted section 2A, creating the offence of \\"causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving\\", without the requirement of intoxication; the sentence is 12 months' imprisonment (6 in Scotland) plus a fine up to the statutory maximum on summary conviction, or 5 years' imprisonment and/or a fine on indictment, plus mandatory disqualification and 3‚Äì11 penalty points. Examples of concentration lapses include being distracted by passengers, adjusting the radio and looking at satellite navigation systems. It is not necessary for a collision or other incident to occur for the offence to be prosecuted. For example, a close pass of a cyclist (contrary to Highway Code rule 163), typically defined as passing within 1.5 metres, is frequently prosecuted as careless driving; in extreme cases, convictions of dangerous driving for close passing without contact have survived appeal.

The town of Cambridge was once a textile manufacturing hub, making the museum a suitable fit with the town's history. Collection The museum's collection encompasses over 10,000 items. These items range from what may be the oldest existing European shoe worn in North America (it was reputedly worn in New Amsterdam and dates to about 1660), to dresses by Hollywood designer Adrian (Adolph Greenberg) to 1970s handbags made from cigarette packs.

The species was first described by Gershom Levy of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2007, though news agencies later reported it in 2010 as a new discovery (with a slightly different spelling) by a team of biologists from the University of Haifa. The spider has a leg span of , making it the largest member of the family Sparassidae in the Middle East. Males have a body length of , while females' body length is . Habitat Cerbalus aravaensis lives in sand dunes, and partly stable sands at the edge of salt marshes. It is nocturnal and is most active in the hotter summer months. It constructs underground dens with hinged, trap-door like operculum made of sand and glue, in order to disguise the entrance from predators. Conservation The Sands of Samar, the last remaining sand dunes in the southern Arava region of Israel and home to Cerbalus aravaensis, are disappearing. The sands once covered as many as , but now cover less than due to re-zoning of areas for agriculture and sand quarries. Mining projects on the sands are intended to be renewed in the near future and thus the habitat's future is uncertain.

Programs Students are exchanged with Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. To encourage cultural immersion and promote international understanding and acceptance, all exchange students stay with a voluntary host family. Students also attend a local high school and are encouraged to participate in extra- curricular clubs, sports and community activities. Students may choose programs varying in length between four weeks to ten months, depending on the country. Some countries, particularly European, will also support students complete a gap year as an exchange student. SCCE also designs programs specifically for school groups wishing to travel together on an exchange program. For many years SCCE has successfully supported many school groups travelling to France, Germany and Italy. Hosting SCCE arranges local Australian school placements and provides support and advice to host families and international students throughout the program. Students stay in Australia for programs of three, five or ten months and bring with them pocket money to support their activities in Australia.

The track is \\"gentle, almost like a lullaby\\" and is comparable to \\"Matinee\\" from Jurado's preceding LP, Where Shall You Take Me?. \\"Big Decision\\" \\"Big Decision\\" combines \\"minimal electronics, keyboards, and samples\\" with \\"quivering strings\\" and \\"melancholic understate[d]\\" vocals to create one of the most optimistic tracks on the album. \\"Lion Tamer\\" \\"Lion Tamer\\" is reminiscent of his 1999 LP Rehearsals for Departure, particularly the tracks \\"The Tragedy\\" and \\"Honey Baby\\". He sings the \\"apathetic\\" vocals with \\"coarser\\" and \\"more forceful\\" vocals to a \\"dreamy haze of piano [and] guitar\\". \\"Fuel\\" The \\"stripped-down and melancholy\\" rock tune \\"Fuel\\" is the dark confessional of a \\"merciless small-town killer\\". \\"Simple Hello\\" Crooked Fingers lead singer Eric Bachmann provides backing vocals on this \\"smoldering rock\\" track that sounds like it belongs on Jason Molina's Songs: Ohia. \\"Sucker\\" Like \\"Lion Tamer\\", \\"Sucker\\" sounds like the material from Rehearsals for Departure. The folk-rock track is \\"upbeat\\" and \\"poppy\\". \\"I Am the Mountain\\" \\"I Am the Mountain\\" is a reworking of the track from his 2004 EP, Just in Time for Something. It is reminiscent of Neil Young and Crazy Horse, a \\"raw\\", \\"stripped-down and melancholy rock\\" tune with an alt-country feel. The \\"bombastic\\" track would fit in on Trials & Errors from Secretly Canadian labelmate Magnolia Electric Co. and breaks up the album's \\"folkier elements\\" \\"with bells and strings, minimal piano and brushed drums\\". \\"Night Out for the Downer\\" \\"Night Out for the Downer\\" is another reworking of a Just in Time for Something track. \\"A Jealous Heart Is a Heavy Heart\\" The album concludes with a tale of \\"sunken relationships and thwarted dreams\\", \\"A Jealous Heart Is a Heavy Heart\\". The tune features \\"violin, electric guitar, and the echo of distantly otherworld keyboard noise\\" then it, and the album, \\"fade into oblivion\\" with \\"a lonely piano coda and a desperate plea\\" to 'Grow old with me'. Reception In his review of On My Way to Absence Todd Martens of Billboard favorably compares Jurado to Nick Drake, Iron & Wine, Cat Power and Elliott Smith. Brian Howe of Pitchfork writes that \\"while it isn't Jurado's most daring work, it is among his most immediately engaging\\" and refers to the album's melody as \\"rich, fragrant and utterly human\\". The songs \\"resonate with the verbal economy and hallucinatory clarity\\", Howe compares them to the short stories of Raymond Carver. Greg Elias of The Good 5 Cent Cigar calls the album \\"more of a pop album than anything he has done\\" and \\"a testament to his ability to maintain artistic integrity in constantly shifting atmospheres\\" proclaiming that Jurado is \\"among the best songwriters of his time and ilk\\". Peter Funk of Stylus calls the album Jurado's \\"saddest though finest efforts to date\\".

Biography Clement Shorter was born on 19 July 1857 at Southwark, in London, the youngest of three boys. The son of Richard and Elizabeth (n√©e Clemenson) Shorter, young Clement attended school from 1863 to 1871 in Downham Market, Norfolk. He was still quite young when his father died in Melbourne, Australia, where he had gone in an attempt to make a better life for his young family. Once finished with his schooling, Shorter spent four years working for several booksellers and publishers on Paternoster Row in London. In 1877, he found himself working in the Exchequer and Audit Department at Somerset House, as a low-level clerk.\\"Biographical Note\\", in the Clement King Shorter Papers. Housed at the University of Delaware Library. Shorter married twice, first to Dora Sigerson, an Irish poet. He married her in 1896, and she died in 1918. In 1920, he remarried, to a woman from Penzance, named Annie Doris Banfield. Shorter, survived by his wife and daughter, died on 19 November 1926, in his home at Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. Career=In journalism Shorter's career in journalism began in 1888, when he began working as a sub-editor for the Penny Illustrated Paper. At that time, he was also writing for The Star, a weekly column about books. By 1890, he had resigned his clerical position at Somerset House, to focus solely on his journalistic endeavours. An important influence on the English pictorial press, in 1891 he became editor of the Illustrated London News. By 1893, he had founded and edited Sketch. In 1900, he founded Sphere, which he edited up until his death in 1926.Shorter bio at Encyclopedia.farlex.com. During this time, Shorter maintained writing his controversial weekly column, \\"A Literary Letter.\\" He described the content of the two papers he edited during this time (first, The Sphere, and shortly thereafter, The Tatler) as \\"on more frivolous lines.\\" In addition to founding Sketch and The Sphere, he was also the founder of The Tatler. As an author, literary critic, and collector It is difficult to separate Shorter's career as an author and critic from his hobby of collecting manuscripts, books, and other materials related to his favorite authors. He was an avid collector, particularly focusing on the works of the Bront√´ sisters. This collecting and research eventually led to some of his most well-known works, including two books about Charlotte Bront√´, and two books about the Bront√´ family. Shorter additionally edited Elizabeth Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bront√´ in 1899. Shorter's own works of literary criticism include The Bront√´s and their Circle (1896), Immortal Memories (1907), The Bront√´s: Life and Letters (1908), and George Borrow and his Circle (1913). Shorter also wrote multiple books about Napoleon, two about George Borrow, as well as a volume of addresses and essays. His last published work was C. K. S.: an Autobiography, which was edited by J.M. Bulloch, and published posthumously, in 1927.

It was founded by New England missionary Jonathan Smith Green during the Kingdom of Hawaii. The third historic structure used by the congregation was designed by noted local architect C.W. Dickey and dedicated in 1917 as the Henry Perrine Baldwin Memorial Church. In 1985, Makawao Union Church was placed on the Hawaii and National Register of Historic Places. Wood-framed church Wood-framed church in early 1900s In 1870, Henry Perrine Baldwin his wife, Emily Alexander Baldwin, and their children joined the church. Henry served as organist for over forty years. Baldwin and his brother-in-law became wealthy co-founders of Alexander & Baldwin. On January 5, 1878, Rev. Green died; Asenath Green would maintain the church until she died in 1894, and then daughters Mary and Laura. His son Joseph Porter Green (1833‚Äì1886) served at the church, and was elected to the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1860. In 1888, Baldwin offered the church a site for a new building, on the foundation of the former Paliuli Sugar Mill near what is now called Rainbow Gulch and Rainbow County Park. The mill was named for Pali uli (literally \\"green cliff\\"), the place in Hawaiian mythology roughly equivalent to the garden of Eden. This church, a New England style white frame structure, was dedicated on March 10, 1889. The PƒÅia Community House, finished in hardwood on the inside, was built in 1914 adjacent to the church. The Community House, with its large auditorium and deep stage was used for plays, operettas, school graduations, concerts, lectures, silent movies and dances. The site of the old church, became the cemetery. Later the Maui Veteran's Cemetery was built adjacent to the church cemetery. A native Hawaiian pastor John Kalama served at both Makawao and Pookela until his death in 1896. The original building stood until about 1900. The \\"Daily Bulletin Newspaper, Honolulu Oct 2, 1889 pg3 Announced the purchase of a new pipe organ built for the church, by the NY firm of Roosevelt. A small organ of one manual/pedal & 6 speaking stops. This being purchased, by Baldwin while he was in New York, he paid a visit to the organ Company. Stone church Stone church at dedication in 1917 The frame church was razed in 1916 and construction began immediately on a new Gothic Revival style structure. The new building was designed by architect Charles William Dickey (1871‚Äì1942), whose mother was Emily Baldwin's sister. It has been called \\"one of his more outstanding works.\\" The stone church was dedicated September 2, 1917. It was about the same size as the frame building, and also used the original Paliuli Mill foundation. Henry Alexander Baldwin (known as \\"Harry\\"), Henry Perrine's son, was featured speaker, along with William Hyde Rice. The organ was donated in the memory of Harry Baldwin's sons Jared Smith Baldwin (1889‚Äì1914) and Leslie Alexander Baldwin (1898‚Äì1901). The walls were built of reinforced concrete with native basalt lava rock veneer. The roof was covered in slate from Vermont. Four stained glass windows and the bell were reused from the old building. A Seth Thomas clock has three faces on the Norman style tower. The main entry is through oak doors in the tower. Austin Craig Bowdish was pastor at the dedication. Augustine Jones became pastor in 1921. The 1938 Maui earthquake damaged the community house, but not the stone church. On June 29, 1985, Makawao Union Church was placed on the Hawaii Register of Historic Places as site 50-05-1610, and December 17, 1985, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii as site 85003227. It now calls itself an \\"interdenominational, community church with Congregational heritage\\". the pastor was Rev. Robin Lunn.

Letter of Marque Racer commissioned in August 1812, under Captain Daniel Chaytor and first lieutenant Thomas West. She was a trader, and made one voyage to Bordeaux, leaving Baltimore in August 1812 and returning in January 1813 with a cargo of brandy, dry goods, and the like. She sailed for Bordeaux again in March, with a cargo of coffee, cotton, and sugar.Garitee (1977), p.279. Battle of Rappahannock River On 13 April 1813, Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, consisting of , , , , , Mohawk and pursued four schooners into the Rappahannock River in Virginia. The British sent 17 boats 15 miles upriver before capturing their prey. One of the schooners, Dolphin, had been on a privateering cruise; consequently she carried 98 men and 12 guns.Chapelle (1967), 214. Under her captain, W.S. Stafford, she fought for some two hours before she struck. In the action the British reported they lost two killed and eleven wounded. American newspapers at first claimed that the British had lost 50 men, later reporting that British losses were two boats sunk with nineteen killed and forty wounded.[Scott, pg. 95] Stafford placed his losses at six killed and ten wounded.Maclay (1899), 467. The British took at least three of the schooners into service. There was already an in service so Racer, of six guns and 36 men, became Shelburne.Dudley (1992), Vol. 2, p.339. Lynx became . retained her name and became a tender commanded by a Lieutenant George Hutchinson.Her service career and what became of her at the end of the war is an open question. Lastly, it is not clear what became of Arab, of seven guns and 45 men, which too had put up some resistance. It was difficult for the British to free Arab and though they eventually succeeded, the vessel was apparently badly damaged and was not commissioned for British service. She was taken to Halifax where the Vice-Admiralty Court condemned her as a prize.Vice Admiralty Court (1911), p.98 In July 1814, prize money remitted from Halifax for Racer, Lynx, Arab and a number of other vessels, was paid. On 29 April 1813, boats from Dolphin, together with boats from Mohawk, Fantome, Highflyer and Racer, which had not yet been renamed, went up the Chesapeake Bay to Frenchtown to destroy five American ships and stores; they also purchased provisions for the squadron from the locals. This took until 3 May 1813 to complete. On the way back, a battery fired on the British from the shore; a landing party destroyed the battery. The Admiralty would later issue the clasp \\"28 April Boat Service 1813\\" for the Naval General Service Medal for the action. British service The Admiralty bought Racer for ¬£1,940.11.5d (amended figure) and the British named her for the town of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, commissioning her under Lieutenant David Hope.Winfield (2008), p.368. They also armed her with ten 12-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns. During 1813 Shelburne captured at least three merchant vessels. *26 August: recaptured the Eliza. *11 October: captured the Margelt. *12 October: captured the Fanny. On 4 March 1814 and Shelburne sailed with a small convoy for Bermuda and the West Indies. Two days later they ran into a gale that scattered the vessels. Some, such as were delayed in their arrival at Bermuda.Lloyd's List 24 May 1814. After the two warships parted ways, Epervier encountered the . The subsequent engagement resulted in the capture of Epervier. Having left Epervier, Shelburne joined the frigate Orpheus. Together, on 20 Apr 1814, they captured the 18-gun sloop USS Frolic. Outnumbered and outgunned, Frolic beat away to southward, making for the coast of Cuba. During the six-hour chase, Frolics men labored to lighten their ship. They cut away the starboard anchor and cast overboard the guns mounted on her port side. Eventually, Hope, seeing Frolic heel and realizing that she was unarmed on her port side, came up prepared to fire a broadside on Frolics unarmed side. Frolic surrendered to Shelburne as Orpheus approached; by this time the vessels were about 15 miles off Matanzas. The British took Frolic into service as Florida. She had been armed with two long 18-pounder guns and twenty 32-pounder carronades. The 18-pounder still on her turned out to be of British make and may have come from Macedonian. The subsequent court martial acquitted Frolic's commander, Joseph Bainbridge, his officers and his crew, of the loss of his ship.Joseph Bainbridge was the brother of another noted US commander, Commodore William Bainbridge. Despite the acquittal, J. Bainbridge did not serve at sea again. Hope was promoted to commander in June, but remained with Shelburne. In October Lieutenant William Hamilton assumed command temporarily, while Hope served as an aide to Admiral Alexander Cochrane in Tonnant. Thereafter, Shelburne served in the blockade of New Orleans and assisted the Creek Indians who were British allies. In 1821 she shared in the distribution of head-money arising from the capture of American gun-boats and sundry bales of cotton at the Battle of Lake Borgne on 14 December 1814. In February 1815 Shelburne and Anaconda, which was also a former American privateer, cruised off the Florida coast north of Havana. Fate On 22 June 1816 Shelburne arrived at Deptford. In October 1817 she was sold to Mr. Brown for ¬£600. Notes, citations, and references Note Citations References * *Dudley, William S. (1992) The Naval War of 1812: A Documentary History.

MD 263 passes by both ends of its old alignment, which is unsigned MD 761 (Old Plum Point Road), on its way to the community of Parran. Within the community, the state highway intersects Emmanuel Church Road, which leads south to the historic home Cornehill. East of Parran, the roadway continues northeast as MD 261 (Willows Road) toward Chesapeake Beach and North Beach while MD 263 veers east toward Plum Point. MD 263 crosses Plum Point Creek and intersects Wilson Road, which heads south toward Dares Beach, in the community of Plum Point. The state highway intersects Ridge Road, which heads north into the center of the beach community, before it reaches its eastern terminus at a dead end just west of the Chesapeake Bay shoreline. History MD 263 was constructed as a wide gravel road from MD 2 east to MD 261 in Parran between 1924 and 1927. The state highway was constructed to Plum Point in 1929 and 1930. MD 263 was widened and paved with bituminous concrete from MD 2 to MD 261 around 1959. The directional crossover intersection at the state highway's western terminus with MD 2/MD 4 was installed in 2007.

The treaty defined the border as being > formed from the French border French Guiana to the British border British > Guiana, the line of the watershed between the Amazon basin to the south, and > the basins of the rivers flowing into north to the Atlantic Ocean. The treaty also established the possibility of designating a joint Brazilian‚ÄìDutch commission that would physically demarcate the border with markers if that was deemed necessary. The boundary defined by the treaty is still the recognized border between Brazil and now-independent Suriname. There are no border checkpoints along the border, and much of the border region consists of impenetrable rainforest, but the boundary commission has set down 60 border markers along the Brazil‚ÄìSuriname border. The border described in the treaty was the result of a negotiation process between the Netherlands and Brazil and followed the establishment of the borders between Brazil and France (French Guiana, to the west) and Brazil and the United Kingdom (British Guiana, to the east. ) that were based on the same watershed. The latter borders were established after an arbitration process that was headed by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and a decision of Switzerland, respectively.

Grant began on March 4, 1869, when Ulysses S. Grant was inaugurated as the 18th president of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office in the aftermath of the Civil War, and he presided over much of the Reconstruction Era. A Republican, Grant became president after defeating Democrat Horatio Seymour in the 1868 presidential election. He was reelected in 1872 in a landslide victory, overcoming a split in the Republican Party that resulted in the formation of the Liberal Republicans, which nominated Horace Greeley to oppose him. He was succeeded as president by Republican Rutherford B. Hayes after the contested 1876 presidential election. Reconstruction took precedence during Grant's two terms of office. The Ku Klux Klan caused widespread violence throughout the South against African Americans. By 1870, all former Confederate states had been readmitted into the United States and were represented in Congress. However Democrats, or former slave owners, violently refused to accept that freedmen were citizens, who were granted suffrage by the Fifteenth Amendment. By 1871 Klan activity was becoming out of control, while Grant and Congress created the Department of Justice and had passed three Force Acts. Grant and his Attorney General Amos T. Akerman began a crackdown on Klan in the South, starting in South Carolina, making arrests and convictions, causing the Klan to demobilize and ensuring a fair election for 1872. Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers, Grant was self-reliant in choosing his cabinet. He relied heavily on former Army associates, who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics. Numerous scandals plagued his administration, including allegations of bribery, fraud, and cronyism. In 1872, Grant signed into law an Act of Congress that established Yellowstone National Park, the nation's first National Park. A strong economy, reduction of the national debt, federal spending, tariffs, and the federal workforce, aided Grant in getting reelected. Congress established a de facto deflationary gold standard that reduced the number of greenbacks in the national economy. However, financial overinvestment in railroad construction caused the Panic of 1873 and economic turmoil. The Long Depression that followed, and Grant's veto of an inflation bill, turned public opinion against him. Democrats regained control of the House in the 1874 elections. While scandals escalated, reformers appointed by Grant were able to clean up some federal departments. Most notably, Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow prosecuted the Whiskey Ring, leading to the indictment of Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock. Grant continued to support Reconstruction, and he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which banned discrimination in public accommodations. Secretary of War William W. Belknap suddenly resigned office in February 1876; afterwards impeached by the House for taking kickbacks. When Grant left office in 1877, Redeemers controlled all Southern state governments. The United States was at peace with the world throughout Grant's eight years in office, but his handling of foreign policy was uneven. Tensions with Native American tribes in the West continued. Under the talented Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, the Treaty of Washington restored relations with Britain and resolved the contentious Alabama Claims, while the Virginius Affair with Spain was settled peacefully. Grant attempted to annex the Caribbean island of Santo Domingo, but the annexation was blocked by the Senate. With the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans. Grant pursued a Peace policy with Native Americans, but persistent western expansion by settlers made conflict difficult to avoid. Grant presided over the Great Sioux War of 1876 and other clashes with the Native Americans. Grant's presidency was traditionally denounced by historians due to corruption charges among subordinates, despite efforts of reform in his administration. His presidential reputation has greatly risen over the past few decades among historians who have noted that Grant advanced a modern presidency, that included a reformed Indian policy, African American civil rights, the first Civil Service Commission, and protected women under federal law. Election of 1868 Grant-Colfax Campaign Poster 1868 Grant's rise in political popularity among Republicans was based on his Union military service during the Civil War, his successful generalship that defeated Robert E. Lee, and his break from President Andrew Johnson over the Tenure of Office Act, when Grant returned the War Office back to Edwin Stanton. His presidential nomination was unopposed and inevitable. The Republican Party delegates unanimously nominated Ulysses S. Grant (Ohio) the Republican Party presidential candidate at its May convention held in Chicago. House Speaker Schuyler Colfax (Indiana), was chosen its vice presidential candidate. The 1868 Republican Party platform advocated enfranchisement of African Americans in the South but kept the issue open in the North. It opposed using greenbacks, only gold, to redeem U.S. bonds, encouraged immigration, endorsed full rights for naturalized citizens, and favored radical reconstruction as distinct from the more lenient policy espoused by President Andrew Johnson. In Grant's acceptance letter he said: \\"Let us have peace.\\" These words became the Republican popular mantra. Electoral Vote Results 1868 The Democratic Party, divided by the Civil War, reunited and was determined to take back the presidency. Democrats accepted the end of slavery and focused on economic policy. The party held its July convention in New York at Tammany Hall. Nathan Bedford Forrest, leader of the Ku Klux Klan, attended its proceedings. The party delegates finally nominated Horatio Seymour (New York) the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Seymour was the war governor of New York but had been reluctant to send Union troops to the war front, favored the anti-war Copperheads, and ineptly handled the New York draft riots. To counter Seymour's political liabilities, the delegates nominated Francis P. Blair (Missouri) for vice president. Although Blair was a Union soldier who served under General William T. Sherman, Blair's campaign rhetoric was caustic and said Reconstruction governments in the South were corrupt and out of control. The Democratic Party platform advocated war bonds be redeemed with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. It advocated former Confederates be allowed to hold elective offices. Grant won the presidential election with an overwhelming Electoral College victory, receiving 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant also received 52.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Grant's margin of victory was enhanced by six southern states controlled by Republicans, while many ex-Confederates were still prevented from voting. First term 1869‚Äì1873 Inauguration of President Grant Mathew Brady March 4, 1869 On March 4, 1869, Grant was sworn in as the eighteenth president of the United States by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase. At age forty-six, he was the youngest president yet elected. In his inaugural address, Grant urged the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment and said he would approach Reconstruction \\"calmly, without prejudice, hate or sectional pride.\\" He also recommended the \\"proper treatment\\" of Native Americans be studied, advocating their civilization and eventual citizenship. Grant pledged all laws would be \\"faithfully executed\\" and argued war bonds redeemed in gold would lower future interest rates. Grant's cabinet choices surprised the nation and were met with both criticism and approval. Grant appointed Elihu B. Washburne Secretary of State, as a friendship courtesy, only to briefly serve office, and then be appointed Minister to France. Grant then appointed conservative Hamilton Fish, former governor of New York, to succeed Washburne. Grant appointed wealthy New York merchant Alexander T. Stewart Secretary of Treasury, but he was quickly found to be disqualified by a federal law that prohibited anyone in office to engage in commerce. When Congress would not amend the law, an embarrassed Grant appointed Massachusetts Congressman George S. Boutwell, to replace Stewart. Grant appointed close friend John A. Rawlins Secretary of War. After serving only a few months Rawlins died in office. Afterward, Grant appointed William W. Belknap of Iowa Secretary of War. Grant appointed Philadelphia merchant Adolph E. Borie Secretary of Navy who soon resigned due to the stress of running the department. Grant appointed relatively unknown George M. Robeson of New Jersey to replace Borie. Grant made three respected appointments: former Ohio Governor Jacob D. Cox Secretary of the Interior, former Senator from Maryland John Creswell Postmaster General, and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar Attorney General. Revised Tenure of Office Act In March 1869, President Grant made it known he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed, stating it was a \\"stride toward a revolution in our free system\\". The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867, sponsored by Radical Republicans, to curb the power of President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments. The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868. To bolster the repeal effort, Grant declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies, until the law was overturned. On March 9, 1869, the House repealed the law outright, but the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the bill and only offered Grant a temporary suspension of the law. When Grant objected, the Senate Republican caucus met, and proposed allowing the President to have a free hand in choosing and removing his own cabinet. The Senate Judiciary Committee wrote the new bill. A muddled compromise was reached by the House and Senate. Grant signed the bill into law on April 5, having gotten virtually everything he wanted. Reconstruction The Civil War brought on a Northern policy of Reconstruction on the former Confederate States that included an absolute \\"economic, political, and economic transformation of the South.\\" The primary goals were the reunification of the nation and the integration of African Americans, given citizenship, into American \\"political, economic, and social life.\\" Grant was considered an \\"engaged and effective executive\\" concerning civil rights for African Americans. Grant hosted Louisiana's Oscar J. Dunn at the White House, America's first elected African American lieutenant governor. Grant appointed Ebenezer Bassett minister resident to Haiti, America's first African American diplomat. Grant signed an equal rights bill into law for African Americans in the District of Columbia. =Fifteenth Amendment= Grant worked to ensure ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment approved by Congress and sent to the states during the last days of the Johnson administration. The amendment prohibited the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's \\"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\\" On December 24, 1869, Grant established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature. On February 3, 1870, the amendment reached the requisite number of state ratifications (then 27) and was certified as the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Grant hailed its ratification as \\"a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day\\". By mid-1870 former Confederate states: Virginia, Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia had ratified the 15th Amendment and were readmitted to the Union. =Department of Justice= On June 22, 1870, Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General, the Office of Solicitor General. Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America's first Solicitor General. Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s. Grant appointed Hiram C. Whitley as director of the new Secret Service Agency in 1869, after he had successfully arrested 12 Klansmen in Georgia who would murdered a leading local Republican official. Whitley used talented detectives who infiltrated and broke up KKK units in North Carolina and Alabama. However they could not penetrate the main hotbed of KKK activity in upstate South Carolina. Grant sent in Army troops but Whitley's agents learned they were lying below until the troops were withdrawn. Whitley warned Akerman, who convinced Grant to declare martial law and send in US marshals backed by federal troops to arrest 500 Klansmen; hundred more fled the state, and hundreds of others surrendered in return for leniency.Charles Lane, Freedom's Detective: The Secret Service, the Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America's First War on Terror (2019) pp 181-84.Jerry West, The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865-1877 (2002). In the first few years of Grant's first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany, New York. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \\"better\\" or \\"stronger\\" than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists. Akerman's successor, George H. Williams, in December 1871, continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant's second term in office. Williams' clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part to the fact that the Justice Department, having been inundated by Klan outrage cases, did not have the effective manpower to continue the prosecutions. =Naturalization Act of 1870= On July 14, 1870, Grant signed into law the Naturalization Act of 1870 that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States. This revised an earlier law, the Naturalization Act of 1790 that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens. The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names, misrepresentations, or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship. =Force Acts of 1870 and 1871= To add enforcement to the 15th Amendment, Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans; Grant signed the bill, known as the Force Act of 1870 into law on May 31, 1870. This law was designed to keep the Redeemers from attacking or threatening African Americans. This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction. On January 13, 1871, Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan in the South. On March 20, Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \\"secure life, liberty, and property, and the enforcement of law, in all parts of the United States.\\" Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy. Congress investigated the Klan's activities and eventually passed the Force Act of 1871 to allow prosecution of the Klan. This Act, also known as the \\"Ku Klux Klan Act\\" and written by Representative Benjamin Butler, was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan. Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship, Grant signed the bill into law on April 20, 1871, after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury, George Boutwell, that federal protection was warranted, having cited documented atrocities against the Freedmen. This law allowed the president to suspend habeas corpus on \\"armed combinations\\" and conspiracies by the Klan. The Act also empowered the president \\"to arrest and break up disguised night marauders\\". The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States. The Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction; there was no organization above the local level. Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans. The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870; South Carolina Governor Robert K. Scott, who was mired in corruption charges, allowed the Klan to rise to power.National Governors Association. Grant, who was fed up with their violent tactics, ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12, 1871. There was no response, and so on October 17, 1871, Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina. Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att. Gen. Akerman and Sol. Gen. Bristow. With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge, including the White League and the Red Shirts. =Amnesty Act of 1872= Texas was readmitted into the Union on March 30, 1870, Mississippi was readmitted February 23, 1870, and Virginia on January 26, 1870. Georgia became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15, 1870. All members of the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded. Technically, the United States was again a united country.U.S. Constitution Online. To ease tensions, Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872 on May 23, 1872, that gave amnesty to former Confederates. This act allowed most former Confederates, who before the war had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, to hold elected public office. Only 500 former Confederates remained unpardonable and therefore forbidden to hold elected public office. Domestic affairsHolidays law= On June 28, 1870, Grant approved and signed legislation that made Christmas, or December 25, a legal public Holiday within Washington D.C. Historian Ron White said this was done by Grant because of his passion to unify the nation. During the early 19th Century in the United States, Christmas became more of a family-centered activity. Other Holidays, included in the law within Washington D.C., were New Year, Fourth of July, and Thanksgiving. The law affected 5,300 federal employees working in the District of Columbia, the nation's capital. The legislation was meant to adapt to similar laws in states surrounding Washington D.C. and \\"in every State of the Union.\\" =Utah territory polygamy= Brigham Young Charles William Carter 1866-1877 In 1862, during the American Civil War President Lincoln signed into law the Morrill bill that outlawed polygamy in all U.S. Territories. Mormons who practiced polygamy in Utah, for the most part, resisted the Morrill law and the territorial governor. During the 1868 election, Grant had mentioned he would enforce the law against polygamy. Tensions began as early as 1870, when Mormons in Ogden, Utah began to arm themselves and practice military drilling. By the Fourth of July, 1871 Mormon militia in Salt Lake City, Utah were on the verge of fighting territorial troops; however, more level heads prevailed and violence was averted. Grant, however, who believed Utah was in a state of rebellion was determined to arrest those who practiced polygamy outlawed under the Morrill Act. In October 1871 hundreds of Mormons were rounded up by U.S. marshals, put in a prison camp, arrested, and put on trial for polygamy. One convicted polygamist received a $500 fine and 3 years in prison under hard labor. On November 20, 1871, Mormon leader Brigham Young, in ill health, had been charged with polygamy. Young's attorney stated that Young had no intention to flee the court. Other persons during the polygamy shut down were charged with murder or intent to kill. The Morrill Act, however, proved hard to enforce since proof of marriage was required for conviction. On December 4, 1871, Grant stated that polygamists in Utah were \\"a remnant of barbarism, repugnant to civilization, to decency, and to the laws of the United States.\\" =Comstock Act= In March 1873, anti-obscenity moralists, led by Anthony Comstock, secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, easily secured passage of the Comstock Act which made it a federal crime to mail articles \\"for any indecent or immoral use\\". Grant signed the bill after he was assured that Comstock would personally enforce it. Comstock went on to become a special agent of the Post Office appointed by Secretary James Cresswell. Comstock prosecuted pornographers, imprisoned abortionists, banned nude art, stopped the mailing of information about contraception, and tried to ban what he considered bad books. =Early suffrage movement= Bennette Lockwood Mathew Brady 1865‚Äì1880 During Grant's presidency the early Women's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention. Anthony lobbied for female suffrage, equal gender pay, and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869, Grant signed into law the protection of married women's property from their husbands' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill, coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood, that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work. Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law. The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary; however, lower tiered female clerks were exempted. The law increased women's clerk salaries from 4% to 20% during the 1870s; however, the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued. To placate the burgeoning suffragist movement, the Republicans' platform included that women's rights should be treated with \\"respectful consideration\\", while Grant advocated equal rights for all citizens. Native American affairs Ely S. Parker Donehogawa After the very bloody frontier wars in the 1860s, Grant sought to build a \\"peace policy\\" toward the tribes. He emphasized appointees who wanted peace, and were favorable toward religious groups. In the end, however, the western warfare grew worse.David Sim, \\"The peace policy of Ulysses S. Grant.\\" American Nineteenth Century History 9.3 (2008): 241-268. Grant declared in his 1869 Inaugural Address that he favored \\"any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship.\\" In a bold step, Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker, Donehogawa (a Seneca), the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Parker met some opposition in the Senate until Attorney General Hoar said Parker was legally able to hold the office. The Senate confirmed Parker by a vote of 36 to 12. During Parker's tenure Native wars dropped from 101 in 1869 to 58 in 1870. Early on Grant met with tribal chiefs of the Choctaw, Creek, Cherokee, and Chickasaw nations who expressed interest to teach \\"wild\\" Natives outside their own settled districts farming skills. Grant told the Native chiefs that American settlement would lead to inevitable conflict, but that the \\"march to civilization\\" would lead to pacification. On April 10, 1869, Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners. Grant appointed volunteer members who were \\"eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy.\\" The Grant Board was given extensive joint- power with Grant, Secretary of Interior Cox, and the Interior Department to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \\"civilize\\" Native Americans. No Natives were appointed to the committee, only European Americans. The commission monitored purchases and began to inspect Native agencies. It attributed much of the trouble in Native country to the encroachment of whites. The board approved of the destruction of Native culture. The Natives were to be instructed in Christianity, agriculture, representative government, and assimilated on reservations. On January 23, 1870, the Peace Policy was tested when Major Edward M. Baker senselessly slaughtered 173 Piegan Indians , mostly women, and children, in the Marias Massacre. Public outcry increased when General Sheridan defended Baker's actions. On July 15, 1870, Grant signed Congressional legislation that barred military officers from holding either elected or appointed office or suffer dismissal from the Army. In December 1870, Grant submitted to Congress the names of the new appointees, most of whom were confirmed by the Senate. Red Cloud Ma»üp√≠ya L√∫ta Grant's Peace policy received a boost when Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud, Ma»üp√≠ya L√∫ta, and Brul√© Sioux Spotted Tail, Si≈ãt√© Gle≈°k√°, arrived in Washington D.C. and met Grant at the White House for a bountiful state dinner on May 7, 1870. Red Cloud, at a previous meeting with Secretary Cox and Commissioner Parker, complained that promised rations and arms for hunting had not been delivered. Afterward, Grant and Cox lobbied Congress for the promised supplies and rations. Congress responded and on July 15, 1870, Grant signed the Indian Appropriations Act into law that appropriated the tribal monies. Two days after Spotted Tail urged the Grant administration to keep white settlers from invading Native reservation land, Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \\"keep intruders off by military force if necessary\\". In 1871, Grant signed another Indians Appropriations Act that ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations. Natives would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statutes. At the core of the Peace Policy was putting the western reservations under the control of religious denominations. In 1872, the implementation of the policy involved the allotting of Indian reservations to religious organizations as exclusive religious domains. Of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received fourteen; the Orthodox Friends ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Roman Catholics seven; the Hicksite Friends six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; Christians two; Unitarians two; American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions one; and Lutherans one. Infighting between competitive missionary groups over the distribution of agencies was detrimental to Grant's Peace Policy. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion.Francis Paul Prucha, American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865‚Äì1900 (2014) pp 30‚Äì71. In another setback, William Welsh, a prominent merchant, prosecuted the Bureau in a Congressional investigation over malfeasance. Although Parker was exonerated, legislation passed Congress that authorized the board to approve goods and services payments by vouchers from the Bureau. Parker resigned office, and Grant replaced Parker with reformer Francis A. Walker. Financial affairs On taking office Grant's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit, which the Republican Congress had just passed. It ensured that all public debts, particularly war bonds, would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks. The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $130 per ounce ‚Äì the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862. On May 19, 1869, Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government. In 1868, a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours; however, much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced. To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \\"no reduction shall be made in the wages\\" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers.Grant (1869), Respecting Wages of labor, Executive Order Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell reorganized and reformed the United States Treasury by discharging unnecessary employees, started sweeping changes in Bureau of Printing and Engraving to protect the currency from counterfeiters, and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue. These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus. By May 1869, Boutwell reduced the national debt by $12 million. By September the national debt was reduced by $50 million, which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for greenbacks and buying back wartime bonds with the currency. The New York Tribune wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the New York Times praised the Grant administration's debt policy. The first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $292 million in 1871 ‚Äì down from $322 million in 1869. The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11% in 1871. Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1, 1869, to 3,804 on December 1, 1871. He had increased tax revenues by $108 million from 1869 to 1872. During his first administration the national debt fell from $2.5 billion to $2.2 billion.The New York Times 1872, \\"The Conduct of the Finances\\". In a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration, Brevet Major General Alfred Pleasonton was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In 1870, Pleasonton, a Grant appointment, approved an unauthorized $60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm. Treasury Secretary George Boutwell promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office. Refusing to resign on Boutwell's request, Pleasonton protested openly before Congress. Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out. Foreign affairs Grant was a man of peace, and almost wholly devoted to domestic affairs. There were no foreign-policy disasters, and no wars to engage in. Besides Grant himself, the main players in foreign affairs were Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Charles Sumner. They had to cooperate to get a treaty ratified. When Sumner stopped Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo, Grant had his vengeance by systematically destroying Sumner's power and ending his career. Historians have a high regard for the diplomatic professionalism, independence, and good judgment of Hamilton Fish. The main issues involved Britain, Canada, Santo Domingo, Cuba and Spain. Worldwide, it was peaceful era, with no major wars directly affecting the United States. In Europe, Otto von Bismarck was leading Prussia into a dominant position in the new united German Empire. After short, decisive wars with Denmark, Austria and France ended in 1871, Bismarck was the dominant figure in Europe, and worked tirelessly and successfully to promote a peaceful continent until his removal in 1890.The main scholarly history remains Allan Nevins, Hamilton Fish: The inner history of the Grant administration (two volumes 1937, 932 pages), winner of the Pulitzer Prize. The most recent scholarly survey is Charles W Calhoun, The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant (2017), pages 151-261, 329-61 426-32. The recent one volume biographies summarize the main topics. Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State, 1869‚Äì1877 =Hamilton Fish= The foreign-policy of the Administration was generally successful, except for the attempt to annex Santo Domingo. The annexation of Santo Domingo was Grant's effort to create a haven for blacks in the South and was a first step to end slavery in Cuba and Brazil. The dangers of a confrontation with Britain on the Alabama question were resolved peacefully, and to the monetary advantage of the United States. Issues regarding the Canadian boundary were easily settled. The achievements were the work of Secretary Hamilton Fish, who was a spokesman for caution and stability. A poll of historians has stated that Secretary Fish was one of the greatest Secretaries of States in United States history.American Heritage (December 1981), The Ten Best Secretaries Of States, volume 33, issue 1, Fish served as Secretary of State for nearly the entire two terms. Hamilton Fish (18081893) was a wealthy New Yorker of Dutch descent who served as Governor of New York (1849 to 1850), and United States Senator (1851 to 1857). Historians emphasize his judiciousness and efforts towards reform and diplomatic moderation.American Heritage Editors (December, 1981), The Ten Best Secretaries Of State‚Ä¶. Fish settled the controversial Alabama Claims with Great Britain through his development of the concept of international arbitration. Fish kept the United States out of war with Spain over Cuban independence by coolly handling the volatile Virginius Incident. In 1875, Fish initiated the process that would ultimately lead to Hawaiian statehood, by having negotiated a reciprocal trade treaty for the island nation's sugar production. He also organized a peace conference and treaty in Washington D.C. between South American countries and Spain.United States Department of State (December 4, 1871), Foreign relations of the United States, pp. 775‚Äì777. Fish worked with James Milton Turner, America's first African American consul, to settle the Liberian-Grebo war. President Grant said he trusted Fish the most for political advice. =Dominican Republic annexation treaty rejected= Charles Sumner Brady-Handy 1865‚Äì1875 In 1869, Grant proposed to annex the independent Spanish-speaking black nation of the Dominican Republic, then known as Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had proposed annexation but Congress refused. In July 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic president Buenaventura B√°ez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Saman√° Bay for $2 million. To keep the island nation and B√°ez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. B√°ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5 million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Saman√° Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870, the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not building support in Congress or the country at large.Harold T. Pinkett, \\"Efforts to Annex Santo Domingo to the United States, 1866‚Äì1871.\\" Journal of Negro History 26.1 (1941): 12‚Äì45. in JSTOR Not only did Grant believe that the island would be of strategic value to the Navy, particularly Saman√° Bay, but also he sought to use it as a bargaining chip. By providing a safe haven for the freedmen, he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights. Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit. He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would push Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba and Puerto Rico, and perhaps Brazil as well. On March 15, 1870, the Foreign Relations Committee, headed by Sen. Charles Sumner, recommended against treaty passage. Sumner, the leading spokesman for African American civil rights, believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war, and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies, thereby blocking black political progress. On May 31, 1870, Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty. Strongly opposed to ratification, Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate. On June 30, 1870, the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against.Simon (1995), The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant, p. xxi Grant's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt, and Bancroft Davis, assistant to Sec. Hamilton Fish, was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations. African American Commissioner Frederick Douglass appointed by Grant believed Santo Domingo annexation would benefit the United States. Warren 1879 Grant was determined to keep the Dominican Republic treaty in the public debate, mentioning Dominican Republic annexation in his December 1870 State of the Union Address. Grant was able to get Congress in January 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island. Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation. Grant appointed Frederick Douglass, an African American civil rights activist, as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic. Returning to the United States after several months, the Commission in April 1871, issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States. To celebrate the Commissions return, Grant invited the Commissioners to the White House, except Frederick Douglass. African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 presidential election by Horace Greeley. Douglas, however, who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House, remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party. Although the Commission supported Grant's annexation attempt, there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty. Unable constitutionally to go directly after Sen. Sumner, Grant immediately removed Sumner's close and respected friend Ambassador, John Lothrop Motley. With Grant's prodding in the Senate, Sumner was finally deposed from the Foreign Relations Committee. Grant reshaped his coalition, known as \\"New Radicals\\", working with enemies of Sumner such as Ben Butler of Massachusetts, Roscoe Conkling of New York, and Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, giving in to Fish's demands that Cuba rebels be rejected, and moving his Southern patronage from the radical blacks and carpetbaggers who were allied with Sumner to more moderate Republicans. This set the stage of the Liberal Republican revolt of 1872, when Sumner and his allies publicly denounced Grant and supported Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republicans. A Congressional investigation in June 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land interests in the Bay of Saman√° that would increase in value if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified. U.S. Navy ships, with Grant's authorization, had been sent to protect B√°ez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel, Gregorio Luper√≥n, while the treaty negotiations were taking place. The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government. B√°ez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the B√°ez government. Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment. The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch's claim and exonerated both Babcock and Ingalls. The Hatch incident, however, kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty. =Cuban insurrection= The Cuban rebellion 1868-1878 against Spanish rule, called by historians the Ten Years' War, gained wide sympathy in the U.S. Juntas based in New York raised money, and smuggled men and munitions to Cuba, while energetically spreading propaganda in American newspapers. The Grant administration turned a blind eye to this violation of American neutrality.Charles Campbell, The Transformation of American Foreign Relations (1976) pp 53‚Äì59. In 1869, Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition. Fish, however, wanted stability and favored the Spanish government, without publicly challenging the popular anti-Spanish American viewpoint. They reassured European governments that the U.S. did not want to annex Cuba. Grant and Fish gave lip service to Cuban independence, called for an end to slavery in Cuba, and quietly opposed American military intervention. Fish, worked diligently against popular pressure, and was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. Minister to Spain Daniel Sickles failed to get Spain to agree to American mediation. Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressures. Grant's message to Congress urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, which eventually petered out. =Treaty of Washington= John Bull (Great Britain) is dwarfed by a gigantic inflated American \\"Alabama Claim\\" cartoon by Joseph Swain in Punch--or the London Charivari 22 Jan 1872. Historians have credited the Treaty of Washington for implementing International Arbitration to allow outside experts to settle disputes. Grant's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty. Previously, Secretary of State William H. Seward during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships, CSS Florida, CSS Alabama, and CSS Shenandoah built in Britain. These damages were collectively known as the Alabama Claims. These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. shipping, as insurance rates soared and shippers switched to British ships. Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages, perhaps including turning over Canada. Confederate Warship CSS Alabama Active service (1862‚Äì1864) In April 1869, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before Congress; publicly denounced Queen Victoria; demanded a huge reparation; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish. A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871, in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.Corning 1918, pp. 59‚Äì84 The Tribunal met on neutral territory in Geneva, Switzerland. The panel of five international arbitrators included Charles Francis Adams, who was counseled by William M. Evarts, Caleb Cushing, and Morrison R. Waite. On August 25, 1872, the Tribunal awarded United States $15.5 million in gold; $1.9 million was awarded to Great Britain. Historian Amos Elwood Corning noted that the Treaty of Washington and arbitration \\"bequeathed to the world a priceless legacy\\". In addition to the $15.5 million arbitration award, the treaty resolved some disputes over borders and fishing rights. On October 21, 1872, William I, Emperor of Germany, settled a boundary dispute in favor of the United States. = Korean incident = John Rodgers' assault on the Korean forts. A primary role of the United States Navy in the 19th century was to protect American commercial interests and open trade to Eastern markets, including Japan and China. Korea was a small independent country that excluded all foreign trade. Washington sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was executed. The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1854 by a Naval display of military force. On May 30, 1871, Rear Admiral John Rodgers with a fleet of five ships, part of the Asiatic Squadron, arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below Seoul. The fleet included the , one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns, 47 officers, and a 571-man crew. While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate, Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes. The American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort, but there was little damage. Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks, but the Royal Court kept silent. After ten days passed, on June 10, Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts. These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa. Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed. Korea still refused to negotiate, and the American fleet sailed away. The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo. Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December 1871. After a change in regimes in Seoul, in 1881, the U.S. negotiated a treaty ‚Äì the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation. Yellowstone and conservation Hayden's Map of Yellowstone, 1871 Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook‚ÄìFolsom‚ÄìPeterson Expedition made a month-long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins. In 1870, the somewhat more official Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins, naming Old Faithful and many other park features. Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region. Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast, geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey. In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $40,000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. Hayden was given instructions by Grant's Secretary of Interior, Columbus Delano. The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians, mostly scientists, and two military escorts. Among the survey party were an artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson. Hayden's published reports, magazine articles, along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone. On December 18, 1871, a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate, by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas, and in the House of Representatives, by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory, for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River. Hayden's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands: \\"The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement, occupancy, or sale, under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles, about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers, and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\\" When the bill was presented to Congress, the bill's chief supporters, ably prepared by Langford, Hayden and Jay Cooke, convinced their colleagues that the region's real value was as a park area, to be preserved in its natural state. The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30, 1872, and by the House on February 27. On March 1, 1872, Grant played his role, in signing the \\"Act of Dedication\\" into law. It established the Yellowstone region as the nation's first national park, made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson (1869), Washburn-Langford- Doane (1870), and Hayden (1871). The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game, including buffalo, from \\"wanton destruction\\" within the confines of the park. However, Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching; as a result, Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment.Kennedy (2001), \\"The Last Buffalo\\"Simon (2003) Papers of Ulysses S. Grant, Volume 25, 1874, pp. 411‚Äì412 By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred, a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park. As the Indian wars ended, Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894, signed into law by President Grover Cleveland, that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone. Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska's Pribilof Islands. This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land.The Wilderness Society (February 16, 2015) Happy Presidents‚Äô Day: 12 of our greatest White House conservationists =End of the buffalo herds= American bison or buffalo; their numbers collapsed in the 1870s forcing the Native Americans who hunted them to depend instead on government-issued food supplies on their reservations. In 1872, around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Kansas, and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands. The demand was for boots for European armies, or machine belts attached to steam engines. Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo. Native Americans protested at the \\"wanton destruction\\" of their food supply. Between 1872 in 1874, the buffalo herd south of the Platte River yielded 4.4 million kills by white hunters, and about 1 million animals killed by Indians.Richard White, The Republic for which it Stands (2017) p 296. Popular concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted, and a bill in Congress was passed, HR 921, that would have made buffalo hunting illegally for whites. Taking advice from Secretary Delano, Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill, believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adopt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo. Ranchers wanted the buffalo gone to open pasture land for their cattle herds. With the buffalo food supply lowered, Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations. Corruption and reformGold Ring thwarted= In September 1869, financial manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up an elaborate scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold at the same time to drive up the price. The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold, thus driving its price. Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4 million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years. =Civil service commission and reform= The reform of the spoils system of political patronage entered the national agenda under the Grant presidency, that would take on the fervor of a religious revival. The distribution of federal jobs by Congressional legislators was considered vital for their reelection to Congress. Grant required that all applicants to federal jobs apply directly to the Department heads, rather than the president. Two of Grant's appointments, Secretary of Interior Jacob D. Cox and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell put in place examinations in their respected departments advocated by reformers. Grant and all reformed agreed that the prevailing system of appointments was unsound, for it maximized party advantage and minimized efficiency and the nonpartisan interest of good government. Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure.John Y. Simon, \\"Ulysses S. Grant and Civil Service Reform,\\" Hayes Historical Journal (1984) 4#3 pp 8‚Äì15. Grant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. He pushed the initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions. However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage, meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labeled corruption. The movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives: to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy and to check the power of President Johnson. Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress, he refused, saying: Grant used patronage to build his party and help his friends. He protected those whom he thought were the victims of injustice or attacks by his enemies, even if they were guilty. Grant believed in loyalty to his friends, as one writer called it the \\"Chivalry of Friendship\\". =Star Route Postal Ring= In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration, lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States. These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents. These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts, an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office; the ring consisted of contractors, postal clerks, and various intermediary brokers. Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell, Grant's 1869 appointment, was Postmaster-General. An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell, but he was censured by the minority House report. A $40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation. In 1876, another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years. =New York Custom House Ring= \\"Salary Grab\\" caption: \\"That salary grab ‚Äì 'You took it'\\" Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper December 27, 1873 Prior to the presidential election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy. Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees. Grant's friend, George K. Leet, was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing for storing goods and splitting the profits. Grant's third collector appointment, Chester A. Arthur, implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage. =The Salary Grab= On March 3, 1873, Grant signed a law that authorized the president's salary to be increased from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year and Congressmen's salaries to be increased by $2,500. Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for the previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government.Jeffery A. Jenkins, et al. \\"Who Should Govern Congress? The Salary Grab of 1873 and the Coalition of Reform.\\" (Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research, WP-05-07 2005) online Election of 1872 Grant-Wilson Campaign Poster 1872 As his first term entered its final year, Grant remained popular throughout the nation despite the accusations of corruption that were swirling around his administration. When Republicans gathered for their 1872 national convention he was unanimously nominated for a second term. Henry Wilson was selected as his running mate over scandal-tainted Vice President Schuyler Colfax. The party platform advocated high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states. During Grant's first term a significant number of Republicans had become completely disillusioned with the party. Weary of the scandals and opposed to several of Grant's policies, split from the party to form the Liberal Republican Party. At the party's only national convention, held in May 1872 New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley was nominated for president, and Benjamin Gratz Brown was nominated for vice president. They advocated civil service reform, a low tariff, and granting amnesty to former Confederate soldiers. They also wanted to end reconstruction and restore local self- government in the South. Electoral Vote Results 1872 The Democrats, who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own, saw an opportunity to consolidate the anti-Grant vote and jumped on the Greeley bandwagon, reluctantly adopting Greeley and Brown as their nominees.Rhodes 1906, v. 7. It is the only time in American history when a major party endorsed the candidate of a third party. While Grant, like incumbent presidents before him, did not campaign, an efficient party organization composed of thousands of patronage appointees, did so on his behalf. Frederick Douglass supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent Ku Klux Klan.Stauffer (2008), Giants, pp. 308, 309 Greeley embarked on a five-state campaign tour in late September, during which he delivered nearly 200 speeches. His campaign was plagued by misstatements and embarrassing moments. However, because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley was no match for Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes and received 55.8 percent of the popular vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both houses of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard- fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral. Second term 1873‚Äì1877 Grant's second inauguration as president by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, surrounded by top officials, on March 4, 1873 The second inauguration of Ulysses Grant's presidency was held on Tuesday, March 4, 1873, commencing the second four-year term of his presidency. it was the only term of Henry Wilson as vice president. Subsequently, the inaugural ball ended early when the food froze. Wilson died 2 years, 263 days into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. Departing from the White House, a parade escorted Grant down the newly paved Pennsylvania Avenue, which was all decorated with banners and flags, on to the swearing-in ceremony in front of the Capitol building. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the presidential oath of office. This was one of the coldest inaugurations in U.S. history, with the temperature at only 6 degrees at sunrise. After the swearing-in ceremony the inaugural parade commenced down Pennsylvania. The Evening Star observed. \\"The private stands and windows along the entire route were crowded to excess.\\" The parade consisted of a variety of military units along with marching bands, and civic organizations. The military units, in their fancy regalia, were the most noticeable. Altogether there were approximately 12,000 marchers who participated, including several units of African-American soldiers. At the inaugural ball there were some 6,000 people in attendance. Great care was taken to ensure that Grant's inaugural ball would be in spacious quarters and would feature an elegant assortment of appetizers, food, and champagne. A large temporary wooden building was constructed at Judiciary Square to accommodate the event. Grant arrived around 11:30pm and the dancing began. Reconstruction Grant was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other 19th-century president. He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.David Herbert Donald, Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man (1970) ch 12 Conservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections. With the destruction of the Klan in 1872, new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South. In Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana, the Red Shirts and White League operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan. Their goals were to oust the Republicans, return Conservative whites to power, and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them. Being loyal to his veterans, Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection. Polygamy, Chinese prostitution, support of Jewish people, and secular education were also issues during Reconstruction. =Colfax Massacre= After the November 4, 1872, election, Louisiana was a split state. In a controversial election, two candidates were claiming victory as governor. Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans. The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor, while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg. Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13, 1873. A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated. The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office. Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg. On March 4, Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg's state militia defeated McEnry's fusionist party's insurrection. Louisiana White League units in 1874 to terrorized black Republicans A dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish. Kellogg's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops. Then on April 13, White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured. A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg. On April 21, Grant sent in the U.S. 19th Infantry Regiment to restore order. On May 22, Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana. On May 31, McEnry finally told his followers to obey \\"peremptory orders\\" of the President. The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana, except, ironically, Grant Parish. =Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas= In the fall of 1872, the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor, Elisha Baxter and Joseph Brooks. Massive fraud characterized the election, but Baxter was declared the winner and took office. Brooks never gave up; finally, in 1874, a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in. Both sides mobilized militia units, and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets. Speculation swirled as to who President Grant would side with ‚Äì either Baxter or Brooks. Grant delayed, requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor, but Baxter refused to participate. On May 15, 1874, Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas, and hostilities ceased. In the fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter, and Republicans and the Redeemers came to power. A few months later in early 1875, Grant announced that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872. Grant did not send in troops, and Brooks never regained office. Instead, Grant appointed him to the high-paying patronage job of US postmaster in Little Rock. Grant's legalistic approach did resolve the conflict peacefully, but it left the Republican Party in Arkansas in total disarray, and further discredited Grant's reputation.Charles W. Calhoun, Conceiving a New Republic: The Republican Party and the Southern Question, 1869‚Äì1900 (2006) p 56. =Vicksburg riots= In August 1874, the Vicksburg city government elected White reform party candidates consisting of Republicans and Democrats. They promised to lower city spending and taxes. Despite such intentions, the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government, which had a majority of African Americans. The White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby, the black Warren County Sheriff and tax collector. Crosby sought help from Republican Governor Adelbert Ames to regain his position as sheriff. Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position. At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443, more than half of whom were African American. On December 7, 1874, Crosby and an African-American militia approached Vicksburg. He had said that the Whites were, \\"ruffians, barbarians, and political banditti\\". A series of confrontations occurred against white paramilitary forces that resulted in the deaths of 29 African Americans and 2 Whites. The White militia retained control of the County Court House and jail. On December 21, Grant issued a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting. General Philip Sheridan, based in Louisiana for this regional territory, dispatched federal troops, who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace. When questioned about the matter, Governor Ames denied that he had told Crosby to use African-American militia. On June 7, 1875, Crosby was shot to death by a white deputy while drinking in a bar. The origins of the shooting remained a mystery. James A. Longstreet and African- American militia attempted to stop a white supremacist revolt at New Orleans in September 1874. =Louisiana revolt and coups= On September 14, 1874, the White League and Democratic militia took control of the state house at New Orleans, and the Republican Governor William P. Kellogg was forced to flee. Former Confederate General James A. Longstreet, with 3,000 African American militia and 400 Metropolitan police, made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops. Consisting of former Confederate soldiers, the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet's army. On September 17, Grant sent in Federal troops, and they restored the government back to Kellogg. During the following controversial election in November, passions rose high, and violence mixed with fraud were rampant; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control. The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature. Grant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep law and order in the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4, 1875, legislature opening meeting. At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel R√©gis de Trobriand, and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. Trobriand returned to the Statehouse and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier. =South Carolina 1876= Former Confederate officer Wade Hampton III was supported by the terrorist group Red Shirts in the 1876 Governor's election in South Carolina. During the election year of 1876, South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor Daniel H. Chamberlain. Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate Wade Hampton through violence and intimidation. The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term. Hampton supporters, donning red shirts, disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling. Tensions became violent on July 8, 1876, when five African Americans were murdered at Hamburg. The rifle clubs, wearing their Red Shirts, were better armed than the blacks. South Carolina was ruled more by \\"mobocracy and bloodshed\\" than by Chamberlain's government. Black militia fought back in Charleston on September 6, 1876, in what was known as the \\"King Street riot\\". The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops. Then, on September 19, the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton. During the massacre, state representative Simon Coker was killed. On October 7, Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \\"rifle club\\" members to put down their weapons. In the meantime, Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina. Out of desperation, Chamberlain wrote to Grant and asked for federal intervention. The \\"Cainhoy riot\\" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \\"Brick Church\\" outside Cainhoy. Blacks and whites both opened fire; six whites and one black were killed. Grant, upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots, finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17, 1876 and ordered all persons, within 3 days, to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes. A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina, and the violence stopped; election day was quiet. Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory, and for a while both acted as governor; Hampton took the office in 1877 after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state. Domestic affairsReligion and schools= Grant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete secularization in public schools. In a September 1875 speech, Grant advocated \\"security of free thought, free speech, and free press, pure morals, unfettered religious sentiments, and of equal rights and privileges to all men, irrespective of nationality, color, or religion.\\" In regard to public education, Grant endorsed that every child should receive \\"the opportunity of a good common school education, unmixed with sectarian, pagan, or atheist tenets. Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private schools... Keep the church and the state forever separate.\\" In a speech in 1875 to a veteran's meeting, Grant called for a Constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit the use of public money for sectarian schools. He was echoing nativist sentiments that were strong in his Republican Party. Tyler Anbinder says, \\"Grant was not an obsessive nativist. He expressed his resentment of immigrants and animus toward Catholicism only rarely. But these sentiments reveal themselves frequently enough in his writings and major actions as general....In the 1850s he joined a Know Nothing lodge and irrationally blamed immigrants for setbacks in his career.\\"Tyler Anbinder, ‚ÄúUlysses S. Grant, Nativist,‚Äù Civil War History 43 (June 1997): 119‚Äì41. online Grant laid out his agenda for \\"good common school education.\\" He attacked government support for \\"sectarian schools\\" run by religious organizations, and called for the defense of public education \\"unmixed with sectarian, pagan or atheistical dogmas.\\" Grant declared that \\"Church and State\\" should be \\"forever separate.\\" Religion, he said, should be left to families, churches, and private schools devoid of public funds. After Grant's speech Republican Congressman James G. Blaine (1830-1893) proposed the amendment to the federal Constitution. Blaine, who actively sought Catholic votes when he ran for president in 1884, believed that possibility of hurtful agitation on the school question should be ended. In 1875, the proposed amendment passed by a vote of 180 to 7 in the House of Representatives, but failed by four votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate. Nothing like it ever became federal legislation. However many states did adopt similar amendments to their state constitution. The proposed Blaine Amendment text was: =Civil Rights Act of 1875= Throughout his presidency, Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans, \\"irrespective of nationality, color, or religion.\\" Grant had no role in writing the Civil Rights Act of 1875 but he did sign it a few days before the Republicans lost control of Congress. The new law was designed to allow everyone access to public eating establishments, hotels, and places of entertainment. This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States. The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872.The New York Times 1875, pp. 1‚Äì2. In his sixth message to Congress, he summed up his own views, \\"While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution ... will be enforced with rigor ... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is and must remain ... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference.\\" In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten.C-SPAN.org 2009. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 proved a very little value to Blacks. The Justice Department and the federal judges generally refused to enforce it, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1883. Historian William Gillette calls it \\"an insignificant victory.\\"William Gillette Retreat from Reconstruction, 1869--1879 (LSU Press, 1982). pp. 259‚Äì279. =Polygamy and Chinese prostitution= In October 1875, Grant traveled to Utah and was surprised that the Mormons treated him kindly. He told Utah territorial governor, George W. Emery, that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons. However, on December 7, 1875, after his return to Washington, Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual State of the Union address that as \\"an institution polygamy should be banished from the land‚Ä¶\\"Various Presidents on Polygamy (July 05, 2011) Grant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women. Grant advocated that a second law, stronger than the Morrill Act, be passed to \\"punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality.\\" Grant also denounced the immigration of Chinese women into the United States for the purposes of prostitution, saying that it was \\"no less an evil\\" than polygamy. =Supported Jews= Grant very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders. In his army days he traded at a local store operated by the Seligman brothers, two Jewish merchants who became Grant's lifelong friends. They became wealthy bankers who donated substantially to Grant's presidential campaign. After the wartime order, however, the Jewish community was angry with Grant. Running for president in 1868 Grant publicly apologized for it.Once elected he set out to make amends. He appointed several Jewish leaders to office, including Simon Wolf recorder of deeds in Washington D.C., and Edward S. Salomon Governor of the Washington Territory. Historian Jonathan Sarna argues: > Eager to prove that he was above prejudice, Grant appointed more Jews to > public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human > rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and > Romania. Time and again, partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what > it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders > No. 11, Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality. > ... Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a > 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the > people.' During his administration, Jews achieved heightened status on the > national scene, anti-Jewish prejudice declined, and Jews looked forward > optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human > rights and interreligious cooperation.Sarna, When General Grant Expelled the > Jews (2012), Introduction Native American affairs Under Grant's Peace policy, wars between settlers, the federal army, and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875. However, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway, threatened to unravel Grant's Indian policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold. In his second term of presidential office, Grant's fragile Peace policy came apart. Major General Edward Canby was killed in the Modoc War. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877. One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875, to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877. =Modoc War= In January 1873, Grant's Native American peace policy was challenged. Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term, fighting broke out between the Modocs and settlers near the California-Oregon border. The Modocs, led by Captain Jack, killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position. Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission. Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby, but Captain Jack killed him. Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a Methodist minister, was also killed. Alfred B. Meacham, an Indian Agent, was severely wounded. The murders shocked the nation, and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated. Grant overruled Sherman; Captain Jack was executed, and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory. This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant's peace policy, according to historian Robert M. Utley. During the peace negotiations between Brig. Gen. Edward Canby and the Modoc tribal leaders, there were more Indians in the tent then had been agreed upon. As the Indians grew more hostile, Captain Jack, said \\"I talk no more.\\" and shouted \\"All ready.\\" Captain Jack drew his revolver and fired directly into the head of Gen Canby. Brig. Gen Canby was the highest-ranking officer to be killed during the Indian Wars that took place from 1850 to 1890. Alfred Meacham, who survived the massacre, defended the Modocs who were put on trial. =Red River War= In 1874, war erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker, leader of the Comanche, led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River, at Adobe Walls, Texas. The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign, and, with few casualties on either side, forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies. Grant, who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan, imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida. =Great Sioux War= In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory. White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868. In 1875, to avoid conflict Grant met with Red Cloud, chief of the Sioux and offered $25,000 from the government to purchase the land. The offer was declined. On November 3, 1875 at a White House meeting, Phil Sheridan told the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers; Grant ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation. Sheridan used a strategy of convergence, using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation. On June 25, 1876, one of these columns, led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and part of his command was slaughtered. Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 Indians. Custer's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation. Sheridan avenged Custer, pacified the northern Plains, and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation. On August 15, 1876, President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $1,000,000 in rations, while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills, except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103rd meridian. On August 28, a seven-man committee, appointed by Grant, gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance. Halfbreeds and \\"squaw men\\" (A white man with an Indian wife) were banished from the Sioux reservation. To receive the government rations, the Indians had to work the land. Reluctantly, on September 20, the Indian leaders, whose people were starving, agreed to the committee's demands and signed the agreement. During the Great Sioux War, Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap (see below). Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux. Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry. Two months after Custer's death Grant castigated him in the press, saying \\"I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary ‚Äì wholly unnecessary.\\" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer, Grant's peace policy became militaristic; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops, two more forts were constructed, the army took over the Indian agencies and Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition. Financial affairsPanic of 1873= The NYSE closed on September 20, 1873 Between 1868 and 1873, the American economy was robust, primarily caused by railroad building, manufacturing expansion, and thriving agriculture production. Financial debt, however, particularly in railroad investment, spread throughout both the private and federal sectors. The market began to break in July 1873 when the Brookyn Trust Company went broke and closed. Secretary Richardson sold gold to pay for $14 million in federal bonds. Two months later, the Panic of 1873, collapsed the national economy. On September 17, the stock market crashed, followed by the New York Warehouse & Security Company, September 18, and the Jay Cooke & Company, September 19, both going bankrupt. On September 19, Grant ordered Secretary Richardson, Boutwell's replacement, to purchase $10 million in bonds. Richardson complied using greenbacks to expand the money supply. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closed for ten days. Traveling to New York, Grant met with Richardson to consult with bankers, who gave Grant conflicting financial advice. Returning to Washington, Grant and Richardson sent millions of greenbacks from the treasury to New York to purchase bonds, stopping the purchases on September 24. By the beginning of January 1874, Richardson had issued a total of $26 million greenbacks from the Treasury reserve, into the economy, relieving Wall Street, but not stopping the national Long Depression, that would last 5 years. Thousands of businesses, depressed daily wages by 25% for three years, and brought the unemployment rate up to 14%. =Inflation bill vetoed and compromise= Political cartoon by Thomas Nast: Grant congratulated for vetoing the \\"inflation bill\\" on April 22, 1874 Grant and Richardson's mildly inflationary response to the Panic of 1873, encouraged Congress to pursue a more aggressive policy. The legality of releasing greenbacks was presumed to have been illegal. On April 14, 1874, Congress passed the Inflation Bill that set the greenback maximum at $400,000 retroactively legalizing the $26 million reserve greenbacks earlier released by the Treasury. The bill released an additional $18 million in greenbacks up to the original $400,000,000 amount. Going further, the bill authorized an additional $46 million in banknotes and raised their maximum to $400 million. Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold. Most of Grant's cabinet favored the bill in order to secure a Republican election. Grant's conservative Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill. On April 22, 1874, after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill, Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the Republican Party because he believed it would destroy the nation's credit. Congress passed a compromise bill, that Grant signed on June 20, 1874. The act legalized the $26 million released by Richardson, and set the maximum of greenbacks at $382 million. Up to $55 million in national banknotes would be redistributed from states with an excess to those states that had minimal amounts. The act did little to relieve the national economy =Resumption of Specie Act= On January 14, 1875, Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act, and he could not have been happier; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act. The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator John Sherman. This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1, 1879. The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the number of greenbacks in circulation. At that time there were \\"paper coin\\" currency worth less than $1.00, and these would be exchanged for silver coins. Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \\"good as gold\\". In an age without a Federal Reserve system to control inflation, this act stabilized the economy. Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration. Foreign affairs Historians credit Secretary of State Hamilton Fish with a highly effective foreign policy. Ronald Cedric White says of Grant, \\"everyone agreed he chose well when he appointed Hamilton Fish secretary of state.\\" =Virginus incident= Emilio Castelar Spanish Republic president (1873‚Äì1874) On October 31, 1873, a steamer Virginius, flying the American flag carrying war materials and men to aid the Cuban insurrection (in violation of American and Spanish law) was intercepted and taken to Cuba. After a hasty trial, the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents, eight of whom were United States citizens; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late. War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain, heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid, retired general Daniel Sickles. Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis, and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the Virginius ship had the right to bear the United States flag. The Spanish Republic's president Emilio Castelar expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration. Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe. With Grant's approval, Spain was to surrender Virginius, pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed, and salute the American flag; the episode ended quietly. =Hawaiian free trade treaty= In December 1874, Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii, David Kalakaua, who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States. Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii, incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economy sphere. =Liberian-Grebo war= The U.S. settled the war between Liberia and the native Grebo people in 1876 by dispatching the to Liberia. James Milton Turner, the first African American ambassador from the United States, requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia, a former American colony. After Alaska arrived, Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia. Midterm election 1874  As the 1874 midterm elections approached, three scandals, the Cr√©dit Mobilier, the Salary Grab, and the Sanborn incident caused the public to view the Republican Party was mired in corruption. The Democratic Party held the Republican Party responsible for the Long Depression. The Republicans were divided on the currency issue. Grant, who with hard money North Eastern Republicans, vetoed an inflation bill. Grant was blamed for the nation's problems, while he was accused of wanting a third term. Grant never officially campaigned, but traveled West, to emphasize his relatively popular Indian policy. The October elections swept the Republicans from office, and was a repudation of Grant's veto. In Indiana and Ohio, the Republicans suffered losses, caused by a breakaway Republican temperance movement. The Democratic Party won the New York governorship to Democrat Samuel Tilden. The Democrats won the House, gaining 182 seats, while the Republicans retained 103 seats. The Republicans retained control of the Senate, but the new class included 14 Democrats and 11 Republicans. The Democratic Party also had strong victories in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Illinois. In the South, the 1874 election campaign was violent. Six Republican office holders were murdered in Coushatta, Louisiana. On September 14, General Longstreet, police, and black militia fought 3,500 White Leaguers who attempted to capture the statehouse in New Orleans, that ended with 32 people killed. Grant issued a dispersal proclamation, the next day, and sent 5,000 troops and 5 gunboats to New Orleans. The White League resistance collapsed. The North disapproved of Grant's federal intervention into the election. Republican representation dropped by 60 percent. Racism in both the North and South caused the rejection of Reconstruction. In his December 1874 annual message to Congress, Grant condemned violence against blacks in the South. Corruption and reform Scandals and frauds continued to be exposed during Grant's second term in office, although Grant's appointments of reformers to his cabinet temporarily helped his presidential reputation, cleaned up federal departments, and defeated the notorious Whiskey Ring. Grant, however, often remained loyal to cabinet members or appointees involved in corruption or mismanagement, refusing to believe in their guilt. The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft. The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain, Robert C. Schenck, using his name to promote a worked out silver mine. The Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson; however, political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal. =Sanborn contracts= In June 1874, Treasury Secretary William A. Richardson gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions. The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator Benjamin Butler, while Sanborn claimed these payments were \\"expenses\\". Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions, but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with. =Pratt & Boyd= In April 1875, it was discovered that Attorney General George H. Williams allegedly received a bribe through a $30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company, Pratt & Boyd, to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries. Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875. =Delano's Department of Interior = By 1875, the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano was in serious disrepair with corruption and fraud. Profiteering prevailed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents. This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant's Indian peace policy. Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow at the expense and exploitation of Native Americans. Delano had allowed \\"Indian Attorneys\\" who were paid by Native American tribes $8.00 a day plus food and travel expenses for sham representation in Washington. Delano exempted his department from Grant's civil service reform implementation in federal offices. Delano told Grant the Interior Department was too large to implement civil service reform. Delano's son, John Delano, and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant, were discovered to have been awarded lucrative corrupt cartographical contracts by Surveyor General Silas Reed. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were qualified to hold such surveying positions. Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll. Under increasing pressure by the press and Indian reformers, Delano resigned from office on October 15, 1875. Grant then appointed Zachariah Chandler as Secretary of the Interior who replaced Delano. Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \\"Indian Attorneys\\" access to Washington. Grant's \\"Quaker\\" or church appointments partially made up the lack of food staples and housing from the government. Chandler cleaned up the Patent Office by firing all the corrupt clerks. =Whiskey Ring prosecuted= In May 1875, Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers. Prosecutions ensued, and many were put in prison. Grant's private Secretary Orville E. Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in trial.Rhodes 1906, p. 187. Grant's new Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and Bristow formed an anti-corruption team to weed out criminal activity during Grant's second term. The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States, and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association. The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments, 110 convictions, and $3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department. Bristow and Pierrpont brought evidence to Grant of Babcock's involvement. Grant asked Babcock with Bristow and Pierrepont in attendance at the White House about the evidence. Babcock gave Grant an explanation that the evidence did not concern the Ring, and Grant quietly accepted Babcock's words at face value. During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders, Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock. As a result, Babcock was acquitted. However, the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation. The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant's political opponents. =Trading post ring= In March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War William W. Belknap was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at Fort Sill. Belknap was allowed to resign by Grant and as a result, was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government. In late April 1876, Grant lashed out at Lieut. Col. George A. Custer, after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant's brother Orville and Sec. Belknap. There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering. Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President. However, Grant refused to see him three times. When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln, he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the Sioux Campaign; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry. However, at Terry's insistence, Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen. =Cattellism= In March 1876, Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company, a grain supplier, in return for real estate, loans, and payment of debts. The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $15 million in naval construction appropriations. Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction, the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \\"Cattellism\\". =Safe burglary conspiracy= In September 1876, Orville E. Babcock, Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings, was indicted in a safe burglary conspiracy case and trial. In April, corrupt building contractors in Washington, D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred. Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring. Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy, but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars. Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander, an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration. There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with.The New York Times 1876 Election of 1876 In the presidential election of 1876, the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrats nominated reformer Samuel Tilden. Results were split. Tilden received 51% of the popular vote; Hayes 48%; many black Republicans were not allowed to vote, however. Twenty key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute. Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent. Grant was watchful; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power. On January 29, 1877, Grant signed the Electoral Commission Act that gave a 15-member bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes. The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes; Tilden received 184. Grant's personal honesty, firmness, and even-handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted.Paul Leland Haworth, The Hayes-Tilden disputed presidential election of 1876 (1906). online Historical evaluations Grant's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption. An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office. In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for African American civil rights. Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise. He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies, signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan. In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington, settling the Alabama Claims issue with Britain through arbitration. Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie, but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873‚Äì1877.C-SPAN 2009 Historians Presidential Leadership Survey Grant, wary of powerful congressional leaders, was the first president to ask for a line item veto‚Äîthough Congress never allowed one.Weisburger, The Item And \\"fight 'em\\" Veto, American Heritage (November, 1995), His presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates. Nepotism, practiced by Grant, was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment. It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly American Civil War, rapid industrialization, and Westward expansionism. His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while president and afterward. Despite the scandals, by the end of Grant's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior (1875), Treasury (1874), and Justice (1875) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members. Grant's generous treatment of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox helped give him popularity in the South. Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda, the Republican party at the end of Grant's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies. His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party, which lost heavily in 1874. Grant's financial policies favored Wall Street, but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with. Revisionist historians during the first half of the twentieth century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant's presidency as a corrupt despot. The 20th-century historical views of Grant were less favorable. Political analyst Michael Barone noted in 1998 that, \\"Ulysses S. Grant is universally ranked among the greatest American generals, and his Memoirs are widely considered to belong with the best military autobiographies ever written. But he is inevitably named, by conservatives as well as liberals, as one of the worst presidents in American history.\\"Michael Barone, \\"A Better President Than They Think\\", The Weekly Standard (August 3, 1998). Barone argues that: \\"This consensus, however, is being challenged by writers outside the professional historians' guild.\\" Barone points to a lawyer Frank Scaturro, who led the movement to restore Grant's Tomb while only a college student, and in 1998 wrote the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant's presidency in a positive light. Barone said that Scaturro's work was a \\"convincing case that Grant was a strong and, in many important respects, successful president. It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history ... Scaturro's work ... should prompt a reassessment of the entire Progressive-New Deal Tradition.\\" In the 21st Century, Grant's reputation and ranking had significantly increased, that followed a series of positive biographies written by noted historians, that included Jean Edward Smith, Grant, H.W. Brands, The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace and most recently Ronald C. White, American Ulysses: A Life of Ulysses S. Grant. Historian Joan Waugh said Grant took steps where a few other presidents attempted \\"in the areas of Native American policy, civil service reform, and African American rights.\\" Waugh said Grant \\"executed a successful foreign policy and was responsible for improving Anglo-American relations.\\" Interest in his presidency has also increased by historians, that included Josiah H Bunting III, Ulysses S. Grant: The American Presidents Series: The 18th President. Administration and cabinet Grant's Cabinet, 1876‚Äì1877 Judicial appointments Morrison Waite 7th Chief Justice of the United States, March 4, 1874 ‚Äì March 23, 1888 Grant appointed four Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States during his presidency. When Grant took office, there were eight seats on the bench. Congress had passed a Judicial Circuits Act in 1866, which provided for the elimination of one seat on the Court each time a justice retired, to prevent Andrew Johnson from nominating replacements for them. In April 1869 Congress passed a Judiciary Act which fixed the size of the Supreme Court at nine. Grant had the opportunity to fill two Supreme Court seats in 1869. His initial nominees were: * Ebenezer R. Hoar, nominated December 14, 1869, rejected by the Senate (Vote: 24‚Äì33) on February 3, 1870. * Edwin M. Stanton, nominated December 20, 1869, confirmed by the Senate (vote: 46‚Äì11) on December 20, 1869, died before he took office. He subsequently submitted two more nominees: * William Strong, nominated February 7, 1870, confirmed by the Senate on February 18, 1870. * Joseph P. Bradley, nominated February 7, 1870, confirmed by the Senate (vote: 46‚Äì9) on March 21, 1870. Both men were railroad lawyers, and their appointment led to accusations that Grant intended them to overturn the case of Hepburn v. Griswold, which had been decided the same day they were nominated. That case, which was unpopular with business interests, held that the federal debt incurred before 1862 must be paid in gold, not greenbanks. Nonetheless, both Strong and Bradley were confirmed, and the following year Hepburn was indeed reversed. Grant had the opportunity to fill two more seats during his second term. To fill the first vacancy he nominated: * Ward Hunt, nominated December 3, 1872, confirmed by the Senate on December 11, 1872. In May 1873, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died suddenly. Grant initially offered the seat to Senator Roscoe Conkling, who declined, as did Senator Timothy Howe. Grant made three attempts to fill vacancies: * George Henry Williams, nominated December 1, 1873, withdrawn on January 8, 1874. The Senate had a dim view of Williams's performance at the Justice Department and refused to act on the nomination. * Caleb Cushing, nominated January 9, 1874, withdrawn on January 13, 1874. Cushing was an eminent lawyer and respected in his field, but the emergence of his wartime correspondence with Jefferson Davis doomed his nomination. * Morrison Waite, nominated January 19, 1874, confirmed by the Senate (vote: 63‚Äì0) on January 21, 1874. Waite was an uncontroversial nominee, but in his time on the Court he authored two of the decisions (United States v. Reese and United States v. Cruikshank) that did the most to undermine Reconstruction-era laws for the protection of black Americans. States admitted to the Union *Colorado ‚Äì August 1, 1876 Vetoes Grant vetoed more bills than any of his predecessors with 93 vetoes during the 41st through 44th Congresses. 45 were regular vetoes, and 48 of them were pocket vetoes.

Akerman ruled that the Civil Service Commission was Constitutional as long as the purpose was to increase government's power to higher qualified workers and improve the efficiency of running the government.New York Times (September 8, 1871), The Civil Service Akerman stated that the Civil Service Commission did not have the Constitutional power to stop or prevent appointments. * Office of the Surgeon General (1871) * Army Weather Bureau (currently known as the National Weather Service) (1870) NotesReferencesBibliography=By author    * Chamberlain reviewed speech by Charles Francis Adams to New York Historical Society on November 19, 1901. *; DOI: 10.14296/RiH/2014/2270 online review        , Pulitzer prize, but hostile to Grant        Simpson, Brooks D.

His toponymic appears in contemporary documents, referring to his ownership of the tenencia of Aza.Barton, 44. His patronymic, \\"Garc√©s\\", reflects that he was son of count Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez, born to the latter's second wife, Eva, probably a Frenchwoman.Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s, 102. After the death of Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez, she remarried to Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara, making Garc√≠a Garc√©s half-brother of Eva's children by Pedro and closely allied with the House of Lara.Barton, 229. According to the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, a contemporary account of the deeds of the Emperor Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile, when that king first entered the capital city of Le√≥n after his succession in March 1126, Garc√≠a Garc√©s was among the Castilians who came to do homage and pledge fealty.Cf. book I, ¬ß7, quoted in Latin and English in Barton, 127. Garc√≠a served Alfonso as alf√©rez between 12 December 1126 and 13 November 1127, while his brother Pedro Garc√©s was alf√©rez between 29 May and 18 September 1131.Barton, 143‚Äì44. This post was generally reserved for younger nobleman early in their careers, the different dates of their respective tenures reflect the difference in their ages. In 1142 Garc√≠a was acting as a civil judge in √Åvila. In 1147, during Alfonso VII's summer campaign against Almer√≠a, Garc√≠a does not appear to have joined the army until later, for he does not appear in any document emanating from Alfonso's court until 4 June, when he was at Calatrava. He neither appears in any later royal charters issued during the campaign, suggesting that he may have been posted at Calatrava with a garrison and did not take part in the sieges of And√∫jar, Baeza, or Almer√≠a.Barton, 178 and 181. On 10 November 1155, while both were with the royal court at Ayll√≥n, Garc√≠a sold an estate at Alcolea to his half- brother Manrique P√©rez de Lara for one thousand maraved√≠s. The charter of sale was drawn up by a certain Sancho, who signed it as \\"chancellor of Count Manrique\\".Barton, 60‚Äì61: Sancius cancellarius comite Amalrich. Garc√≠a married a younger daughter of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba, sometimes named Eva and other times Sancha.Barton, 206. In 1157, with his wife, Sancha P√©rez, Garc√≠a donated their monasterium (monastic church) of San Florencio near Aza to the abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos \\"for the relief of our souls and the remission of all our sins\\".Barton, 206: grato animo et uolantate spontanea, ob remedium animarum nostratum et remissionem omnium peccatorum, facimus cartam donationis. Garc√≠a and his wife had at least two daughters: Elvira and Mayor, who married Gonzalo de Mara√±√≥n. He may have had another two, named Sancha and Mar√≠a, but a Juana, mother of Domingo de Caleruega, is apocryphal.Mart√≠nez D√≠ez, 194‚Äì96. In 1159, according to Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada in his De rebus Hispaniae, the Lara family, after they had succeeded by guile in wresting custody of the young King Alfonso VIII from his guardian, Gutierre Fern√°ndez de Castro, placed him under the care of Garc√≠a Garc√©s. It soon became apparent, however, that he was not wealthy enough to properly look after royalty and he was placed in the household of Manrique.Doubleday, 36.Barton, 84. Also in 1159, Garc√≠a donated the hostel of Tardajos to the Diocese of Burgos. NotesBibliography *Simon F. Barton. The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile.

His early studies were widespread, however, and he published a book on the usage of the French language in 1692. In his 30s he studied medicine at Reims and Paris, receiving his degree in 1697, and in 1701 he was appointed to the faculty of the Coll√®ge de France and the editorial board of the Journal des savants. Worms Title page of the English translation of Andry's Breeding of Worms Andry's early medical work lies within the nascent germ theory of disease. His first book, De la g√©n√©ration des vers dans les corps de l'homme, was published in 1700, and translated into English in 1701 as An Account of the Breeding of Worms in Human Bodies. The book was an account of Andry's experiments with the microscope, building on the earlier work of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, whom Andry cites frequently. Unlike Leeuwenhoek, Andry's purpose is specifically medical, and his experiments with the microscope led him to believe that the microorganisms he called \\"worms\\" were responsible for smallpox and other diseases.\\"The History of the Germ Theory,\\" The British Medical Journal vol. 1 no. 1415 (1888), p.312. Illustrations drawn from microscopic observation, from Breeding of Worms The book contains a detailed discussion of spermatozoa, which Andry calls \\"spermatic worms.\\" He observes: \\"If you cut up a dog, and after you have taken off one Testicle, by the help of a Microscope examine the Humour that comes out of the deferent vessel, you shall discover in it such a hideous number of little worms, that you shall hardly be able to believe your own Eyes.\\"An Account of the Breeding of Worms in Human Bodies, London, 1701, p. 279, quoted in R. C. Punnet, \\"Ovists and Animalculists,\\" The American Naturalist vol. 62 no. 683 (1928), p. 491. Andry confirms an argument previously made by Leeuwenhoek, that spermatozoa are \\"the occasion of the Generation of all Animals.\\" Though Andry recognizes the importance of sperm to reproduction, however, he addresses their workings primarily in the context of parasitology, and essentially considers spermatozoa to be a unique species of parasitic worm.Punnet, 493-94. The book seems to address a general audience in addition to a medical one. As medical historian Clara Pinto Correia has observed, one of Andry's principal purposes was to educate the public about the new science that was emerging from under the microscope. He wrote, \\"We must admit that there are animals a thousand times less than a grain of dust, which we can scarcely see. [...] Our imagination loses itself in this thought, it is amazed at such a strange littleness; but to what purpose should it deny it? Reason convinces us of the existence of that which we cannot conceive.\\" The book was well-received, and became a standard text in the field. Andry was appointed Dean of the Facult√© de M√©decine de Paris in 1724. Orthop√¶dia Andry published his introduction to orthopedics in 1741 under the title Orthop√©die, then a neologism. It was translated into English in 1743 as Orthop√¶dia. Aimed more at parents than physicians, the book presents a theory of human anatomy, skeletal structure, and growth, along with instructions for correcting deformity. Andry explains in the book that he formed its title \\"of two Greek Words, viz. Orthos, which signifies straight, free from deformity, and Pais, a Child. Out of these two words I have compounded that of Orthop√¶dia, to express in one Term the Design I Propose, which is to teach the different Methods of preventing and correction of Deformities of Children.\\"From Orthop√¶dia, quoted in F. N. L. Poynter, \\"Christener of Orthopaedics\\" (review of a facsimile edition of Orthop√¶dia), The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 5248 (1961), p. 360. Frontispiece of Orthopaedia Though the book was read and cited extensively in the period, its main lasting influence in medicine has been its title, which became the name of the field devoted to skeletal and related injuries and ailments (later modified to \\"orthop√¶dics\\" and \\"orthopaedics\\" or, in American spelling, \\"orthopedics\\").J. B. Kirkup, \\"Nicolas Andry and 250 years of orthopaedy,\\" The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, vol. 73-B, no. 2 (1991), 361‚Äì362. Outside of medicine, the principal impact of the book derives from the engraving on the frontispiece, which shows a straight stake tied to a crooked sapling, a metaphor for the correction of deformities in children. The engraving captured the attention of contemporary readers; it is referred to, for example, in George Colman's 1787 comic opera Inkle and Yarico.Daniel O'Quinn, \\"Mercantile Deformities: George Colman's Inkle and Yarico and the Racialization of Class Relations,\\" Theatre Journal 54 (2002), 396. Andry's frontispiece has played a significant role in the cultural studies of eighteenth-century medicine. It is included, without comment, as the last in a series of ten eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrations in Michel Foucault's influential study of the history of correction, Discipline and Punish. Scholar Paolo Palladino has explained Foucault's use of the image as showing that \\"practices as disparate as orthopedics and horticulture were increasingly predicated on operative principles that focused on the manipulation of these different life forms' presumed common material substance. Moreover, the image raises questions of agency, since it is unclear who exactly bound the tree: no human or divine form is visible anywhere in the background; the image therefore accorded with Foucault's understanding that the operation of these principles was invisible and pervasive.\\"Paolo Palladino, \\"Life ... On Biology, Biography, and Bio-power in the Age of Genetic Engineering,\\" Configurations 11 (2003), 82. A simplified version of Andry's illustration continues to serve as the international symbol for orthopedics, used by a number of different institutions in multiple countries. Modern recognition In conjunction with Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons presents three awards annually including the Nicolas Andry Award.

It was a single-seat, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable landing gear. Development The F.4 was developed in parallel with the Caproni Vizzola F.5, with which it shared a common airframe. Design began in late 1937 by a team led by F. Fabrizi. The aircraft had a welded steel-tube fuselage and a wooden wing; the fuselage was covered with flush-riveted duralumin, while the wing had a stressed plywood skin. Fabrizi and his design team intended the F.4 (standing for Fabrizi 4) to be powered by a 12-cylinder Isotta-Fraschini Asso 121 R.C.40 water-cooled engine rated for at , but the Italian Air Ministry preferred that the Asso not be used in fighters; the F.4 project therefore was halted prior to construction of a prototype in favor of continued development of the F.5, which employed a radial engine.Green and Swanborough, p. 109 In the summer of 1939, Italy received its first Daimler-Benz DB 601A‚Äîa liquid-cooled inverted V-12 engine rated at from Germany. This gave the F.4 project a new lease on life, as the Air Ministry approved of its use in fighters. The last of 12 pre-production F.5 aircraft ordered for the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) was selected for conversion into the F.4 prototype, powered by the DB 601A. It flew for the first time in July 1940. No further F.4s were ordered, and a proposal to build a production model powered by an Alfa Romeo-built DB 601A as the F.5bis was dropped in favor of pursuing development of the more advanced Caproni Vizzola F.6M. Operational history The Regia Aeronautica assigned the lone F.4 prototype to the 303¬™ Squadriglia, which operated it experimentally during 1942.

Fitchen served for 23 years with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in banking relations and as an examiner and then with the bank's cash and check handling operations. Paul met Eleanor Beach, daughter of renowned sculptor Chester Beach, while she was attending Vassar College. Eleanor and Paul were married in the Beach's 17th Street brownstone on December 29, 1934, which was their primary residence until Paul retired in 1967. Their first home was an apartment overlooking Gramercy Park where their first child, Douglas, was born in 1936 and their second, Ellen, in 1939. In 1940, accommodations in the brownstone were rearranged for the growing family. Chester and Mrs. Beach moved into an apartment on the top floor and the Fitchens took over the lower floors where their third child Anne, was born in 1943.

Established in 1879 in Indianapolis, Indiana during the national convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), it was a concept of Matilda Carse, an Irish-born American businesswoman, social reformer and leader of the temperance movement. The WTPA was designed as a joint-stock company and operated in Illinois. No man could own its stock, as it could only be sold to WCTU women. It began with $5,000 of capital stock, which increased to $125,000. The Board of Directors consisted of seven women, including Carse. The WTPA was dissolved in 1903. Newspaper At the first convention of the WCTU, the need of an official organ was recognized, and Abby Fisher Leavitt, of Cincinnati, moved the appointment of a committee \\"to consider the question of publishing a paper\\". The following June, the first number of the paper, called the Woman's Temperance Union, was issued, its first editor being Jennie Fowler Willing, of Illinois, and its publisher Mary Coffin Johnson, of New York. At an executive meeting held at the close of the Newark Convention in 1876, a publishing committee was appointed: Mary Towne Burt, New York; Jane M. Geddes, Michigan; Frances E. Willard, Illinois; Esther Pugh, Ohio; Harriet Maria Haven, Vermont; Zerelda G. Wallace, Indiana, and Caroline Brown Buell, Connecticut. Burt, Willard and Buell were made a quorum for the transaction of business. The quorum at once changed the name to Our Union, made Burt publisher, and Margaret Elizabeth Winslow, of Brooklyn, editor. In 1882, at the Louisville Convention, the paper was combined with the Illinois Signal under the name, Our Union Signal, and became the property of the Woman's Temperance Publication Association, which, although separately incorporated, was the publishing house of the National W. C. T. U. The weekly newspaper was named The Signal and its first issue appeared January 4, 1880; it was 16 pages in size. The first editor was Mary Willard, mother of Frances Willard, the second president of the WCTU. At the end of the first year, there were 3,200 subscriptions. Eventually, readership reached over 90,000 subscribers. It employed 135 people. \\"Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth\\" was the newspaper's motto. In 1882, The Signal merged with Our Union of New York to become The Union Signal. Other publications In addition to the newspaper, the WTPA published article reprints called \\"Timely Talks\\". After consolidating its \\"Illinois Workers' Leaflets\\", \\"National Leaflets\\" covered instruction in departmental work. The Oak and Ivy Leaf was written for young women, The Young Crusader was for children, and there were also several books. The Band of Hope Lesson Manual was published as a quarterly.

In 1921, the school was put under state government and started operating under the name of the State School of Decorative Arts and the Art Industry. During the years 1919‚Äì1925 the educational program implemented related primarily to crafts, art industry and painting. A new Department of Interior Design was opened in the academic year 1927/28. By 1927 there were six faculties within the School: Department of Decorative Painting and Design, Department of Graphics and Bookbinding, Department of Ceramics, Faculty of Metal Sculpture, Bronzing and Jewellery, Department of Textiles and the Department of Interior Design. In 1929, the staff and students of the Pozna≈Ñ took part in the Universal National Exhibition (Pol.

The institute's education lasted five years and was divided into one-year courses at the General Department and special departments - the academic year in each department began on September 10 and ended on June 20. In these years, the Institute employed a total of 40 employees, 23 teachers and instructors, 12 supplementary teachers and 4 members of administrative staff, while the students were divided into ordinary and extraordinary, depending on their previous education. As a part of the Institute's activities, a public drawing room was opened with a drawing course.

In the 1950s, because of the restrictions of the authorities, painting, graphics and weaving were abolished and replaced with furniture making and interior design, which became the main disciplines taught at School. After the Khrushchev Thaw, the school moved to the building of SƒÖdownictwo Krajowe, which belongs to the University of Arts complex to these days. A number of art galleries closely related to the university were opened and were active throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  1996 onwards  In 1996, the School obtained the status of the Academy of Fine Arts, and in 2010 the status of the University of Arts. In 2013 the revitalization of the main building was completed, restoring the previous facade colour and architectural details, such as ornaments and sculptures. In 2016, a new didactic building was opened, housing working spaces for students, television and film studios, a paintshop, a printing house and an exhibition space in the lobby. The lobby was equipped with the so-called acoustic shower.

In the eleventh and twelfth centuries in Spain, serious crimes such as murder, rape, arson, robbery, and cattle rustling were generally punished by the local lord with the imposition of a calumnia, or compensatory fine. These were more often paid in land than in monies, and this contributed heavily to Froila's increase in landed wealth, as several of his charters demonstrate.Barton, 79. A record of all these transactions is kept in the archives of the convent of Santa Mar√≠a de Otero de las Due√±as, to which its foundress, Mar√≠a N√∫√±ez, granted all her Leonese properties inherited from her ancestors, with their titles deeds, in 1240.

Eyre served with James King in the Caribbean during the American War of Independence, seeing action in a number of engagements. With the conclusion of the war, he was based at times at Halifax, and later off the South American coast and in the Mediterranean. With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Eyre served in the Mediterranean and was involved in the Siege of Toulon, before being given his first command, the 14-gun brig-sloop . The command was short-lived, and Speedy was chased down and captured by a large French fleet. Taken into captivity, Eyre and his men endured harsh conditions until being exchanged back to Britain. Acquitted for the loss of his ship and given a new command, Eyre went out to the West Indies, but returned to Britain in 1799 and saw little further employment until 1806, when he joined the Mediterranean fleet and was active off the coast of Spain, supporting Spanish resistance to the French. In 1809 he went to the Adriatic and took part in the campaign there, helping to capture several islands. He launched an assault on Santa Maura and was wounded during the operations. After participating in the blockade of Corfu he returned to the Spanish coast and resumed operations there in support of the Spanish partisans. Returning to England again in 1811, he went ashore and was not actively employed for the rest of the Napoleonic Wars, though he received a knighthood and was later appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He returned to service in 1823, commanding the South American station during a time of particular diplomatic difficulties, and on returning home in 1826 retired ashore owing to illness. He died in 1839. Family and early life George Eyre was born the fourth and youngest son of politician Anthony Eyre, who had represented the constituency of Boroughbridge in a number of parliaments, and his wife, Judith Letitia. George's elder brother, Anthony Hardolph Eyre, also entered politics and represented Nottinghamshire during the 1800s. George attended Harrow School and after spending several months at an academy in Chelsea, entered the navy in 1782. His first ship was the 44-gun , under the command of Captain James King. They went out to Jamaica escorting a convoy, and remained in the area for the rest of the American War of Independence. On 2 March 1783, while sailing in company with , two ships were discovered anchored in Turks Island passage. On being spotted the two ships cut their cables and stood to the southwest, upon which Resistance promptly gave chase. The rearmost ship, carrying 20 guns, sprang her main topmast, and surrendered after Resistance came up and fired a broadside. She then gave chase to the other, carrying 28 guns, and after enduring fire from her stern chasers, came alongside and the Frenchman promptly surrendered. The ships were discovered to be two transports that had taken troops to Turks Island, garrisoning it with 530 men. One of the ships, the 28-gun Coquette was commanded by the Marquis de Grasse, nephew of the Comte de Grasse. One or two days later Resistance fell in with a small squadron under Captain Horatio Nelson, consisting of , , and the armed ship Barrington. Nelson decided to attack the recently garrisoned Turks Island, and 250 men were landed under the cover of supporting fire from the ships. The French were found to be heavily entrenched, and the British withdrew after being unable to dislodge them. With the end of the war Eyre returned to England with King aboard , but soon rejoined the Resistance and went out to Halifax to join Sir Charles Douglas. As Douglas' flagship spent most of her time in port, Eyre was sent out to cruise on other ships, including under Captain Stanhope, and under Captain Thomas Foley. Eyre returned to Britain with Resistance in 1786, and the following year joined the 44-gun under Captain Francis Parry. Parry went out as commodore to Guinea, but ill-health obliged him to resign his command, and Eyre went to Newfoundland aboard Captain Trigge's . Eyre joined Admiral Lord Howe's flagship during the Spanish Armament, and in November 1790 was promoted to lieutenant. He then joined under Captain Edward Thornbrough, and after Scipio was paid off, under Captain Robert Stopford, in which he sailed to the Mediterranean. French Revolutionary Wars , Eyre's short-lived command On the outbreak of war with France in 1793 Eyre was appointed to , the flagship of Rear-Admiral John Gell, a relation of Eyre's. He was present at the capture of a French privateer and her Spanish registered prize St Jago. St George went on to join Admiral Lord Hood's fleet at Gibraltar, and went with him to Toulon. Eyre took an active part in the Siege of Toulon, volunteering to command the detachment of marines landed from St George and sent to defend Fort La Malgue. He went from there to command the battery at Fort Pharon, and after some time attracted Hood's attention with his good service. Hood appointed him to his flagship . After the fall of Toulon and the British evacuation he was advanced to commander and appointed to command the sloop , succeeding Commander George Cockburn, who had been appointed to command . He assisted in the capture of Bastia, and was then ordered to join off Nice. Capture While making his way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite pressing on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin asked him if he had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that \\"...I must tell you that it is now un guerre √† mort [a war to the death]; and if I had been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom.\\" At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them. Eyre and the crew were landed and marched to Antibes, where they were imprisoned with the crew of a Sardinian frigate that had been captured the day before Speedy. The crew had been imprisoned on Martin's flagship Sans Culotte and had been severely treated, with their captain, Ross, not being allowed to wash or shave. The British were placed in a dungeon at Antibes, with only straw to lie on, awaiting the decision of the authorities. After three weeks in this state, they were marched to Aix-en- Provence and were confined in the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. The British were paroled. Eyre and the officers were taken to Romans, in Dauphin√© where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released in exchange for a French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted. West Indies Eyre was next appointed to command the sloop , before being made post-captain on 6 June 1796 and given command of the 20-gun . He went out with Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian to the West Indies and took part in the reduction of Saint Lucia. While there he was appointed by Sir Hyde Parker to command the 44-gun and carried out a number of cruises, capturing several prizes and winning himself riches and recognition. While cruising off Puerto Rico on 11 July 1798 Eyre located five merchant ships at anchor under a shore battery at Aguada, and decided to attempt to capture or destroy them. The ship's boats were sent in under Lieutenants Good and Holman while Regulus and a prize schooner stood close by to support them. The wind failed however, and neither ship could get near enough to support them, but Lieutenant Good pressed on, and boarded the ships. With no wind he was unable to bring them all out, and so destroyed the two he was unable to sail out. British casualties, despite being under fire for the whole operation, amounted to one man wounded. Eyre returned to Britain in September 1799, transporting Vice-Admiral Richard Rodney Bligh. Napoleonic Wars= Spanish coast  Lord Cochrane, a later commander of Eyre's first command Speedy. Eyre helped to evacuate his garrison from Rosas. Eyre was then unemployed for a while, with the exception of a brief period in temporary command of from 11 February to 18 March 1801, succeeding Thomas Hardy and in turn being succeeded by William Wolseley. He finally received a posting in July 1806 when he was appointed to the 64-gun , but was soon moved to command the newly built 74-gun . Magnificent initially served with the Channel Fleet, which was then under Admiral Lord St Vincent, before going out to the Bay of Biscay with Sir Eliab Harvey's squadron. Eyre moved to the Mediterranean in June 1807, coming under Lord Collingwood's orders while based off Cadiz. With the Spanish rising on 2 May 1808 and the surrender of the French squadron in Cadiz on 14 June, Collingwood sent Eyre to patrol off Toulon. Shortly afterwards he was sent to Rosas to support the Spanish there, and several days later evacuated Lord Cochrane and his garrison from Fort Trinidad. Adriatic Eyre was next appointed by Lord Collingwood to take command of the squadron in the Adriatic in April 1809, a command that then consisted of three ships of the line and seven or eight frigates. In October 1810 he was sent with Magnificent, and to join Captain John William Spranger's squadron and assist in the capture of Cephalonia, Zante and Cerigo, part of a long running campaign in the Adriatic. Santa Maura initially remained in French hands, and became a base for small cruisers which were an annoyance to the British forces. Eyre resolved to attack and capture it and together with General John Oswald and troops of the 35th Regiment of Foot made a landing on 22 March 1810. The French withdrew to a citadel, protected by three redoubts, which the British attacked. During the heavy fighting Eyre was hit in the head by a musket ball and knocked to the ground, narrowly avoiding death as three other balls passed through his clothing. Eyre handed over command of the expedition to Captain James Brisbane of HMS Belle Poule while he recovered, and was well enough to resume command on 25 March. The British forced the French to surrender on 16 April, the British casualties being seven dead and 39 wounded. Eyre was personally thanked by Admirals Sir George Martin and Sir Charles Cotton, and the Lords of the Admiralty. With the islands secure Eyre enforced the blockade of Corfu. On 6 February 1811 he encountered an enemy relief convoy bound from Otranto to Corfu, consisting of 25 ships. Eyre captured 22 of them, carrying grain, ordnance and 500 troops. Eyre also stationed several frigates in the northern part of the Adriatic under the command of Captain William Hoste. Hoste went on to win a significant victory over a French squadron under Bernard Dubourdieu at the Battle of Lissa. Eyre spent a total of two years commanding the station, the time spent almost constantly at sea, only briefly putting into port to refit and replenish supplies. He was succeeded in the post by Captain Charles Rowley and went to join the fleet of Toulon. On the occasion of his departure his subordinate, James Brisbane wrote Return to Spain The Mediterranean fleet was by now under Sir Edward Pellew, and Eyre was sent to the Spanish coast to support the Spanish forces fighting the French. Eyre was particularly active off the coast of Valencia and evacuated the garrison of Oropesa del Mar, earning the thanks of General Joaqu√≠n Blake y Joyes. On being ordered back to England in 1811 Pellew also wrote a private letter of thanks, following on from his earlier declaration that 'I have to express my complete approbation of Captain Eyre's methods, and have much satisfaction of employing the services of that most excellent officer in the aid of the Valencia patriots.' Eyre arrived in England in 1812, his health having been affected by his five years on a foreign station, and requested and received permission to go ashore. As a mark of his services in the Adriatic and off Spain he was knighted by King George III. Eyre was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 4 June 1814 and was nominated as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath following the expansion of the order on 12 January 1815. Flag rank and South America Eyre was promoted to rear-admiral on 12 August 1819 and shortly afterwards received an offer from Lord Melville to take command of the Cape and St Helena stations, but was unable to accept owing to matters of a personal nature. In 1823 he was able to accept the offer of the command of the South American station, at a time when several of the former Spanish colonies were declaring independence. Eyre was able to successfully manage delicate diplomatic and military duties, and was able to protect British rights and possessions in the area during periods of upheaval. His actions in the region included signing treaties with Spain and Portugal involving the prevention of illegal slave trafficking. He stepped down after the expiration of his posting and was succeeded by Admiral Sir Robert Otway. Family and later life Eyre returned to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes in climate had brought on an attack of gout, and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron was already on the spot, he was at liberty to refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. He appears to have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, with whom he had a family of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire. Notes a. The defeat of the French fleets by Lord Howe at the Glorious First of June and the subsequent acquisition of large numbers of French prisoners caused the French to abandon the policy of guerre √† mort, lest their own men also be shown no quarter. b. Speedy was retaken on 25 March 1795 by Captain Thomas Fremantle's , and went on to serve under a number of commanders, including Jahleel Brenton, and Hugh Downman, and won particular fame under Lord Cochrane, before her final loss to a French fleet on 3 July 1801. She went on to serve with the French and Papal navies until being broken up in 1807. c. Magnificent arrived on 2 December in company with the bomb vessel , joining , and HMS Imperieuse. Cochrane and the garrison were evacuated on 5 December.

NASA's Kepler space telescope has discovered its first five new exoplanets, or planets beyond the Solar System. Kepler's high sensitivity to both small and large planets enabled the discovery of the exoplanets, named Kepler-4b, 5b, 6b, 7b and 8b. The 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) took place in Washington, D.C., Jan. 3 to Jan. 7, 2010. It is one of the largest astronomy meetings ever to take place as 3,500 astronomers and researchers were expected to attend and give more than 2,200 scientific presentations. The meeting was actually billed as the \\"largest Astronomy meeting in the universe\\". An array of discoveries were announced, along with new views of the universe that we inhabit; such as quiet planets like Earth - where life could develop are probably plentiful, even though an abundance of cosmic hurdles exist - such as experienced by our own planet in the past. Infrared scanning the sky A gas giant forms from instellar gas and dust of a distant proto-star. The NASA mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is to use infrared light to scan the entire sky for millions of hidden objects, including asteroids, failed stars and powerful galaxies . Launched on December 14, 2009, the data from WISE will serve as a navigation tool for other probes in space missions, such as NASA's Hubble telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The first image was presented at the 215th annual AAS meeting. An infrared snapshot of a region in the constellation Carina, near the Milky Way was taken shortly after the survey telescope ejected its cover. In a patch of sky three times larger than the moon, the picture shows about 3,000 stars in the Carina constellation. Planet formation around massive Stars The focus for discovering new exoplanets has been on sun-like stars. The catalog of more than 400 exoplanets has proved that these searches are successful, because exoplanets of various sizes have been discovered. However, other star types are also a likely place to discover new exoplanets. New research, announced at the meeting, confirms that planet formation is a natural by-product of star formation. Planet formation occurs even around stars much more massive than the Sun. However, the life of the stars which the planets orbit are so short that intelligent extraterrestrial life is not very likely. A and B type stars were surveyed for the research which involved NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey, and astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). Gravitational wave detection Map of seventeen newly discovered millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way galaxy. Milky way is in the background and the pulsars are circled. Credit: NASA/DOE/Fermi LAT Collaboration In a span of three months seventeen pulsars - millisecond pulsars - were discovered in the Milky Way galaxy. Unknown high-energy sources detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope revealed the existence and location of the pulsars. This is an accelerated pace for discovering such objects, which could be used as a \\"galactic GPS\\" to detect gravitational waves passing near Earth. Although the pulsars are relatively old they have not slowed because, these millisecond pulsars have been kept rapidly rotating and renewed with material by accretion of matter from a companion star. The combined total of 60 known millisecond pulsars creates an all-sky array. Precise monitoring of timing changes, utilizing this array, may allow the first direct detection of gravitational waves. Temperature, gravity, and planet migration An artist's impression of protoplanetary disk. According to the classical model of planet migration, the earth should have been drawn into the sun as a planetoid, along with other planets. However, a new theoretical model was presented at the annual meeting. It shows that the assumption a proto-planetary disk around a star has constant temperature across its whole span is erroneous. Portions of the disk are actually opaque and so cannot cool quickly by radiating heat out to space. This creates temperature differences across the disk, and these differences have not been accounted for before in models that were applied. The differences in temperature counteract the natural gravitational pull of the sun (or proto-sun), at a crucial time during planet formation. Kepler space telescope On 4 January 2010, the Kepler space telescope announced the discovery its first five new exoplanets, named Kepler-4b, 5b, 6b, 7b and 8b. These exoplanets had sizes comparable to that of Neptune to larger than Jupiter, with orbits ranging from 3.3 to 4.9 days, and estimated temperatures ranging from 2,200 ¬∞F to 3,000 ¬∞F (1,200 ¬∞C to 1,650 ¬∞C). Super-earth HD156668b The discovery of HD156668b, a super-earth class exoplanet, was announced on January 7, 2010, at the 215th meeting American Astronomical Society (AAS), in Washington DC. Illustration of the inferred size of the super-Earth GJ 1214 b (center) in comparison with Earth and Neptune. Overview A super-Earth is an extrasolar planet with a mass between that of Earth and the Solar System's gas giants. The term super-Earth refers only to the mass of the planet and does not imply anything about the surface conditions or habitability. Andrew Howard of the University of California at Berkeley, announced the planet's discovery at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C. At the meeting, the details of the findings were first presented by the research group which had used the twin Keck Telescopes in Hawaii to detect the exoplanet. With the twin telescopes functioning as a single observatory, by means of interferometry, it was determined that HD156668b is only four times larger than the Earth, and the second smallest exoplanet yet found. There are over 400 exoplanets thus far discovered, and only a very small number are categorized as Super-earth class. Finding such planets as HD156668b, which are closer to earth in size, has become a priority in Astronomy science. For example, the Kepler mission, is part of the intense popular interest surrounding the discovery of hundreds of planets orbiting other stars. Kepler telescope, however has a more specific mission - to discover hundreds of terrestrial planets which are defined as exoplanets that are one half to twice the size of the Earth. A priority is to find those in the habitable zone of their stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. Discoveries such as HD156668b allow astronomers such as the Keck research group to demonstrate they are able to find smaller and smaller planets. Ultimately, results such as those from the Keck group, and the Keppler mission will allow the Solar System to be placed within a continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy. HD156668b, is considered to be relatively close at just 80 light-years away. It is in the constellation Hercules. According to early measurements, it appears to be orbiting its parent star about once every four days (approximately). The wobble of the planet's star revealed the existence of HD156668b. The alignment probability is 0.5% for finding a planet in an Earth-like orbit about a solar-like star, compared to the giant planets discovered in four-day orbits, the alignment probability is more like 10%. Other researchers from the California Institute of Technology, Yale University and Penn State University also participated in the study. Black hole update Black holes along with new data were a notable topic at the conference. Black hole pairs Almost every galaxy has a black hole with a mass of one million to one billion times that of the sun. A super-massive black hole, of more than 4 million solar masses, is located in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. As the universe has evolved, galaxies often collide and merge, creating larger galaxies. This has led to the supposition that galaxies in mid-merge should have a two great black holes (a pair) orbiting one another. Expectations were, that this should be a common observation, hand in hand with mid merge collisions. However, observation has not validated this supposition; only a few orbiting pairs had been found. When observation did not match expectation, this posed problems for theories of how galaxies merge and grow. These statistics have been recently altered. 33 pair of super-massive orbiting black holes were recently discovered. The first 32 pair by the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey conducted with the Keck II Telescope on Hawaii‚Äôs Mauna Kea. This survey determined which black hole was moving toward earth at which time. When the black hole moves toward Earth, its light is blue-shifted, meaning it has a shorter wavelength. Orbiting pairs were identified by looking for instances when one black hole was blueshifted and the other redshifted. The pairs orbit each other at 200 km per second, at several thousand light years apart. Intermediate mass black hole In this image, X-rays from Chandra X-ray Observatory are shown in blue and are overlaid on an optical image from the Hubble Space Telescope. The Chandra observations show that this object is an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX). Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/UA/J. Irwin et al; Optical: NASA/STScI ---- Chandra X-ray Image of the intermediate black hole event, (NGC 1399), without the Hubble Space Telescope overlay. Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/UA/J. Irwin et al; Optical: NASA/STScI ---- In a globular cluster 65 million light years from Earth evidence is accumulating that a black hole, one thousand times more massive than the sun, has caused the destruction of a white dwarf star. It appears that the white dwarf is heating up as it falls toward the black hole. This event creates an intense stellar astrophysical X-ray source, called an ultraluminous X-ray source. The indication of this type of strong X-ray source means that it is more luminous than any known stellar X-ray source, but less luminous than the X-ray intensity of supermassive black holes, which places it in the range of theorized intermediate black holes. Their exact nature of ULXs has remained a mystery, but one suggestion is that some ULXs are black holes with masses between about a hundred and a thousands times that of the Sun. A mix of detected natural elements seems to indicate the actual source of the X-ray emissions are debris from the white dwarf. If evidence authenticates the observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Magellan telescopes, it means the first actual observation of an intermediate black hole. Furthermore, it would be the first confirmed observation of a black hole destroying a star. And it would support theories which state intermediate black holes exist in globular clusters. Prior to this it has been argued that supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are to be attributed with disruption and destruction of stars. However, observing such an event in a globular cluster is a first. To date no candidate for an intermediate black hole has been widely accepted. =A possible candidate= Data obtained in optical light with the Magellan I and II telescopes in Las Campanas, Chile, also provides intriguing information about this object, which is found in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1399 in the Fornax galaxy cluster. The spectrum reveals emission from oxygen and nitrogen but no hydrogen, a rare set of signals from within globular clusters. The physical conditions deduced from the spectra suggest that the gas is orbiting a black hole of at least 1,000 solar masses. To explain these observations, researchers suggest that a white dwarf star strayed too close to an intermediate-mass black hole and was ripped apart by tidal forces. The black hole is swallowing material from the white dwarf star, and the material‚Äôs velocity implies the size of the black hole. In this scenario the X-ray emission is produced by debris from the disrupted white dwarf star that is heated as it falls towards the black hole and the optical emission comes from debris further out that is illuminated by these X-rays. Another interesting aspect of this object is that it is found within a globular cluster, a very old, very tight grouping of stars. Astronomers have long suspected globular clusters contained intermediate-mass black holes, but there has been no conclusive evidence of their existence there to date. If confirmed, this finding would represent the first such substantiation. Galactic Dark Matter Halo The Milky Way, and probably most other galaxies too, are surrounded by a halo of dark matter. The shape of the Milky Way has been determined. The research is the first time scientists have measured the three-dimensional shape of a dark matter halo . Other milestones This section will be expanded. If a massive white dwarf star explodes millions of years from now it could threaten the earth. The Hubble Space Telescope has taken the deepest look into the universe yet, revealing some of the most distant, earliest galaxies to form after the Big Bang.

The Capul√≠ preceded the Piartal and Tuza cultures in the archaeological record ranging from around 800 to 1500 CE. The Capul√≠ culture left a strong record through its pottery. The Capul√≠ had distinctive black on dark red pottery with rectilinear geometric designs. The anthropomorphic pottery statues of the Capul√≠ can be striking. Women are depicted with a wrap that extends from the armpit to the ankle while men have loincloths and are often shown with an object such as a drum or animal. These figures are often called coqueros because they are depicted with wads of coca leaves in their mouths. Scholars have associated the figures with shamans and possible funerary rituals. Capul√≠ goldwork is similar to that of later Ecuadoran and Columbian cultures. Smiths hammered and soldered high-carat gold into geometric and zoomorphic designs. The most abstract Precolumbian works in gold come from the Capul√≠ era in the Colombian/Ecuadorian highlands. Capul√≠ graves contained a mix of grave goods including conch shells and stone axes.

Mountain in Philadelphia and then Martin E. Thompson and James Renwick in New York (Renwick designed the Smithsonian Museum), interning at Renwick's firm. Wilson worked with William Walter at the Walter and Wilson firm, before establishing his own practice in Cincinnati. He became the most noted architect in the city. His Old Main Building for Bethany College and Plum Street Temple buildings are National Historic Landmarks. His work includes many Gothic Revival architecture buildings, while the synagogue is considered Moorish Revival and Byzantine Architecture. Wilson was the first president of the Cincinnati chapter of the American Institute of Architects (1870 to 1871 and again from 1872 to 1873). He is known for his design of the Old Main buildings on the campus of Bethany College; his work on Isaac M. Wise's Plum Street Temple (now known as Isaac M. Wise Temple), is celebrated both for its design and as a location important as a fount of reform Judaism in the United States. His son, H[enry] Neill Wilson, worked in his father's firm (and is credited with the design of the Rookwood Pottery building [1891‚Äì1892] at 1077 Celestial in Mount Adamsand); he then established his own practice in Minneapolis, Minnesota, before moving to Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Background and training Wilson began his studies with Charles A. Mountain in Philadelphia and continued them with Martin E. Thompson and James Renwick in New York. In 1847, he traveled in Europe, returning to set up his practice at the age of 20. Wilson partnered with William Walter from 1851 to 1863. He also partnered with William Stewart and with whom he designed many Cincinnati buildings including Mother of God in Covington, Kentucky (1871) and Covenant First Presbyterian Church (1875).

Wilson's design was influenced by James Renwick, whose office he studied in, and may have been modeled after Renwick's design of the Smithsonian Museum (1845‚Äì1847). Wilson was in partnership with William Walter, an older architect, at the time of Old Main's construction, but the design was most likely Wilson's \\"because his training had occurred during the increasing vogue of the Gothic style\\". William Kimbrough Pendleton, a member of the faculty and vice-president of Bethany College, also had a role and contributed his practical knowledge of architecture with the supervision of construction and has been credited with responsibility for its placement on the crest of the hill as well as suggesting the arcade (architecture) on the back of the building.

Local architects included James W. McLaughlin (1834‚Äì1923), Samuel Hannaford (1835‚Äì1910), and Charles Crapsey (1840‚Äì1909). Together they established one of the earliest chapters of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Cincinnati was the 2nd Chapter of the AIA. Although Cincinnati's spectacular growth slowed after 1870, the work that continued included several buildings by Wilson. Plum Street Temple Interior of the temple facing the Torah The Plum Street Temple commission was one of the first of many American Moorish Revival synagoguesMoorish Influence At Home in the City, by Francis Morrone, New York Sun, December 15, 2006 and is a National Historic Landmark. Similar buildings in Germany were destroyed by Hitler, although examples survive in other parts of Europe. The building was designed in a 19th-century Germanic architectural style is said to blend Neo-Byzantine architecture and Moorish Revival styles derived from the architecture of Moorish Spain. The synagogue includes a tripartite twin-domed facade copied from the Leopoldst√§dter Tempel in Vienna, Austria, that was built in 1853. The U.S. building has a rose window and basilica style arch, similar to a Gothic Cathedral, but its Islamic influences are visible in its minarets and other details. Plum Street Temple, one of the oldest synagogues in existence in the United States, now known as the Isaac M. Wise Temple The synagogue was designed in an architectural style that had emerged in Germany in the nineteenth century, combining Byzantine and Moorish styles, hearkening back to the Golden Age of Jewish history in Spain. There is a Moorish theme in the motifs decorating the entrances are repeated in the rose window and on the Torah Ark and the 14 bands of Hebrew texts surrounding the interior are said to have been selected by Rabbi Wise primarily from the Book of Psalms. The building has been carefully preserved and maintains the original flooring, pews, and pulpit furnishings. The chandeliers and candelabra, formerly gaslight, are electrical but use the original fixtures, and the pipe organ, built by the Cincinnati firm of Koehnken and Company is still in place (although in need of restoration). The building was placed on the Department of the Interior‚Äôs National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A restoration in 1994 and 1995 \\"renewed a sense of vitality and sparkle to a building which looks much the same now as when it was built 137 years ago\\". Personal life Wilson eventually lived in Glendale and was one of Glendale's incorporators in 1851. John Baker was Wilson's father-in-law and lived nearby in the John Baker House. His wife's brother Samuel also lived nearby, and Wilson designed his home. It is speculated that Wilson adopted his wife's family name for business reasons. Wilson died on October 21, 1894 and is buried in the family cemetery plot in Spring Grove Cemetery: Section 49; Lot 1, Space 6 (no tombstone apparent) where his daughter has a marker.

He is known for his style of feminine, romantic women and strong men painted with loose but accurate brushwork. Considered one of the highest paid book illustrators of his time, he created over 3,000 book covers, movie posters and magazine illustrations. Biography Born Giuseppe Dangelico Daeni in Bari, Italy, in November 8, 1939, his talents were recognized by his first grade teacher, who advised Pino's father, Tommaso Dangelico, to encourage his son's artistic precociousness. However, Tommaso remained skeptical of his son's future as an artist. He was a self-taught artist. Eventually, Pino enrolled at the Art Institute of Bari, then went on to Milan‚Äôs Academy of Brera in 1960, where he honed his craft for painting from the live nude. From 1960 to 1979, his work garnered several prizes and awards. During this period, he was commissioned by two of Italy's largest publishers, Mondadori and Rizzoli, for numerous book illustrations. After a visit to Manhattan in 1971, Pino's experiences of the art scene at that period led him to feel restricted in Milan, and in 1978, he moved to New York, where he believed the artistic freedom would allow him greater opportunities. He brought with him his family‚Äîwife Chiara, seven-year-old daughter Paola, and five-year-old son Max. Under the sponsorship of the Borghi Gallery, he held several shows in New York and Massachusetts. His work caught the attention of both Dell and Zebra Book Publishers, and soon after, Bantam, Simon & Schuster, Penguin USA, Dell, and Harlequin. His romance novel covers, painted for such authors as Danielle Steel, Sylvie Summerfield and Amanda Ashley, helped sell millions of books using a then unknown fellow Milanese Italian model named Fabio. By the end of his career, he had designed about 3,000 book covers. In 1992, Pino felt the strain of tight deadlines. Eager to leave illustration behind to return to his impressionist revival painting, he contacted one of the major galleries in Scottsdale, Arizona and sent five paintings, which were well received. From then on, his paintings appeared in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina and in Garden City, Long Island, NY. Pino made several appearances on major TV networks, and was interviewed in national and international journals. In 2001, Pino's son, Max, began representing his artist-father, despite Pino's initial reluctance. Max successfully grew his efforts into a profitable marketing company, helping his father expand beyond his normal gallery representation to include magazines, books and limited edition fine art prints. His work continues to appear in art galleries all over the world, and his gicl√©e prints sell into the thousands of dollars. On May 25, 2010, Pino died at the age of 70 due to cancer. Influences Pino was deeply influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites and Macchiaioli, and after experimenting with Expressionism, he returned to his Impressionist roots. He found inspiration in the works of such artists as Sargent, Sorolla, and Boldini. Style His subject matter often revolves around sensuous women in beaches and boudoir settings indoors in tetradic color schemes that evoke the 19th century with women that are beautiful yet confident. Pino painted with oils on linen. His trademark brushwork is characterized by softly lit females painted with smooth greenish shadows and distinctive, thick pastel-tinted highlights, often with vibrant colored dresses and backgrounds. Noted for his ability to capture fleeting expressions and movement, his women are often lost in thought or waiting for their lovers.

The House of Castro is an Iberian noble lineage present in the since the Middle Ages in the kingdoms of Castile, Galicia, and Portugal. Though its exact origins are disputed, the House of Castro became one of the most powerful families of the Spanish and Portuguese nobility. History The first clearly identified member of the family was early-12th century count Fernando Garc√≠a de Hita, a kinsman and vassal of Urraca of Le√≥n and Castile. This kinship, along with his patronymic, have led to him being considered illegitimate son of Urraca's uncle Garc√≠a II of Galicia.V√°zquez, Germ√°n. More recently, it has been suggested that he was the son of count Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez by the infanta Urraca Garc√©s of Navarre, and perhaps scion of the Banu G√≥mez clan.Salazar Acha, 33‚Äì68. During the reign of Alfonso VIII, the Castro family, under Gutierrez Fernandez, rivaled another major Castilian family, the House of Lara, for power in the kingdom of Castile. The lack of heirs in the senior line resulted in the rise of a cadet branch seated in Galicia. This branch became the most powerful of the Galician nobility, and one of the most powerful in Spain. Traditionally linked to the county of Lemos, the most illustrious representatives were the \\"Great Count of Lemos\\" and his uncle, Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro Osorio. Another scion, Pedro Antonio Fern√°ndez de Castro is still well remembered in Peru. The arms of Portuguese and Galician branches of the House of Castro The House of Castro became one of the most powerful families of the Spanish and Portuguese nobility. The House of Castro went into decline because of their lack of offspring, with the county of Lemos passing to the House of Alba. The coat of the Galician branch of the House of Castro were six blue roundels on a silver field. The Portuguese branch used a variant that included thirteen roundels on gold.

Location  The original Ossidinge station was located about 200 meters from the Cross River located on a low ridge of land between the terraced bank of the Ekoi villages Agborkum and Oban.  History  As part of the licensing of the Gesellschaft Nordwest-Kamerun (GNK) and the transfer of large areas in western Cameroon to it by the colonial administration, the station manager of the government station Rio del Rey, Lieutenant von Queis, was ordered to establish a station as outpost in the area of the Cross River. Queis died in a combat with the Ekoi. The government led a punitive expedition under the command of Captain von Besser, who in July 1900 started to build a station in Nssakpe, which on 17 July 1901 was displaced to Ossidinge by Hans Glauning. On 15 November 1902 it was put under civil administration, managed by Kurt Graf P√ºckler-Limpurg. In January 1904, after excesses of European and colored merchants, serious riots of the Anyang started which were living in the North of the station; P√ºckler-Limpurg was killed and the station was completely destroyed. This uprising was put down by massive military force, and the station was rebuilt. In 1908, however, it still consisted only of makeshift shacks and huts. Already in 1904, it was considered to relocate the station for health and strategic reasons. In 1909 it was relocated 30 km upstream at Mamf√©, which was then called Ossidinge II. On 1 April 1909, the former governmental station was promoted as Bezirksamt (seat of the government of a district). Its last governor was the former Schutztruppe officer Adolf Schipper, who died in 1915 when fighting near Banypo. Today Ossidinge II is known as Mamfe.

The flood was caused by cloudbursts and prolonged rain from the Meiyu rain front which dropped 1,000 mm (3.3 ft.) of rain over Mount Aso and Mount Hiko. This downpour resulted in the overflow of many of the surrounding rivers, such as the Chikugo River. The flood was a major disaster with 1,001 people dead or missing, 450,000 houses flooded, and about 1 million people affected. Due to the severity of the disaster, flood control measures along rivers in Northern Kyushu were fundamentally revised, with many of the changes still in place. The flood was not given an official name by the Japan Meteorological Agency which has resulted in it being referred to differently in a variety of sources. In Kumamoto Prefecture, In reference to the Shirakawa river which flows down from Mount Aso. or 6.26 refers to the 26th day of June are usually used. In Kitakyushu city, they tend to use . Causes The flood was the result of a combination of meteorological and geological factors that contributed to large amounts of precipitation as well as topographical features which exacerbated the effects of the precipitation. Meteorological Weather at 9 a.m. June 26 at the time of heaviest rainfall in northern Kyushu. Low pressure in Tsushima. Rainy season front extending toward central China and extending to south of Fukushima Early June the Meiyu rain front had briefly come to a standstill over north-central Kyushu, raining over the city of Fukuoka and Nagasaki at the start before latter bringing rains over Kumamoto.‰πùÂ∑ûÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÈôÑÂ±ûÂõ≥Êõ∏È§®„ÄéÊ∞¥„ÉªÂ∑ù„ÉªÂÆ∂„Éª‰∫∫„ÅÆË®òÊÜ∂ Ë•øÊó•Êú¨Â§ßÊ∞¥ÂÆ≥„Åã„Çâ50Âπ¥„ÄÅÁÅΩÂÆ≥„ÇíÂøò„Çå„Å™„ÅÑ„Åü„ÇÅ„Å´„Äè 2013Âπ¥10Êúà23Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ß Later the front moved south over Amami ≈åshima before fluctuating between Amami ≈åshima and Yakushima. Meanwhile from the south, the Pacific High in the area around the Philippines began to grow in strength and push the rain front into the Tsushima Strait. At the same time a mobile anticyclone from China began pushing the rain front back towards Yakushima. Trapped between these two competing forces the rain front became stabilized over Mount Aso around June 23. Moist, warm air from the high pressure areas stimulated the rain front while low pressure waves that would have normally passed through were instead redirected through the Tsushima Strait. Working in tandem these meteorological conditions generated the cloudbursts and prolonged rain that led to the unprecedented amount of precipitation over northern Kyushu.„ÄéÁ≠ëÂæåÂ∑ù‰∫îÂçÅÂπ¥Âè≤„Äèpp.124-125 =Precipitation= { border=\\"\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\"\\" +Amounts of Precipitation !Point of Measurement!!Total Amount (June 25‚Äì29)!!Amount on maximum precipitation day!! - !Uenoda, ≈åita!!1,148.5!!400.0 (June 26) - !Miyahara, Kumamoto!!1,002.6!!426.2 (June 25) - !Oguni, Kumamoto!!994.6!!433.6 (June 25) - !Yabe, Fukuoka!!934.2!!395,0 (June 25) - !Nogami, ≈åita!!929.7!!364.0 (June 25) - !Kurokawa, Kumamoto!!888.4!!500.2 (June 26) - !Hita, ≈åita!!705.6!!292.4 (June 25) - !≈åita, ≈åita!!698.5!!223.1 (June 26) - !Moji,Fukuoka!!646.1!!398.3 (June 28) - !Fukuoka, Fukuoka!!621.4!!307.8 (June 25) - !Kumamoto, Kumamoto!!595.9!!411.9 (June 26) - !Saga,Saga!!587.1!!366.5 (June 25) - !Kurume, Fukuoka!!564.3!!308.7 (June 25) - !Iizuka, Fukuoka!!534.8!!235.5 (June 25) } Geographical In addition to the heavy precipitation, geographical factors contributed to and exacerbated the flood. Mount Aso, one of the largest active volcanoes in the world, has produced throughout the surrounding area a lava cap of andesite which is poorly permeable to water. Additionally, deforestation during and after the Second Would War had decreased the local water retention capacity. These factors combined to allow the precipitation to quickly flow unimpeded into nearby waterways which subsequently exceeded their capacities. Furthermore, just two months prior on April 27, Mt. Aso had erupted and deposited 5.16 metric tons of ash which combined with the rain water to produce a debris flow. Topographically, the rivers in northern Kyushu tend to follow steep grades which cause them to flow rapidly downstream. Additionally the river systems in the area have larger drainage basins upstream than middle- and downstream with the Shirakawa River and Chikugo River having drainage basin ratios of 80%ÂõΩÂúü‰∫§ÈÄöÁúÅÊ≤≥Â∑ùÂ±Ä„ÄéÁôΩÂ∑ùÊ∞¥Á≥ªÊ≤≥Â∑ùÊï¥ÂÇôË®àÁîª Ê≤ªÊ∞¥„ÅÆÁèæÁä∂„Å®Ë™≤È°å„ÄèPDF 2010Âπ¥8Êúà29Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ß and 70%„ÄéÁ≠ëÂæåÂ∑ù‰∫îÂçÅÂπ¥Âè≤„Äèp.4 respectively between their upstream and downstream systems. These topographical features resulted in the upstream systems quickly accumulating and transporting water in amounts that the lower stream systems couldn‚Äôt handle. Flood=Flood in Kumamoto, 6.26 Great Flood * In Kumamoto Prefecture, the central river Shirakawa flooded most severely, and people remember it by the name of 6.26 Suigai (flood). The factors of the 6.26 flood were: heavy rain in the Aso district (in Kurokawa mura), the rainfall reached 888.4 mm in 5 days, another factor being the soil of the areas; it contained layers rich in yona (volcanic ash) over lava; which easily liquefies on heavy rain. ** A similar event was seen in 1993 Kagoshima Heavy Rain. * On April 27, Mount Aso erupted and a great amount of volcanic ash which fell was mixed with rain; producing peculiar debris flow in the Kurokawa river and Shirakawa river merging into Shirakawa into Kumamoto. * The third factor was the Kumamoto city; the river Shirakawa was the so-called tenjo-kawa, or a ceiling river, namely, the river bed is higher than its surroundings such as Shimotori. These factors worsened the damage of the flood. * 70% of the then Kumamoto city was flooded, except the Kyomachi Hills and Kengun area. The central areas of Kumamoto City were 2.5 meters to 3 meters deep in muddy water. 15 bridges out of 17 in the city were carried away except Taiko Bridge and Choroku Bridge. Kokaibashi was carried away with 40 inhabitants. * The disposal of 60 billion tons of muddy soil presented big problems; 116 areas including a moat of the Kumamoto Castle were used. The Kumamoto city gave subsidies to clean up the streets; ¬•2,000 for bicycle trailers, ¬•4,500 for 3-wheel cars and ¬•10,750 for a truck; producing many small enterprises with trucks.50 years have passed after the 6.26 Shirakawa Flood. Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, 2003. p.61 * A house for the aged was destroyed and 52 people were killed. * The damage amounted to ¬•17.3 billion (¬•121.93 billion now) * Even in the southern part of Aso gun, the dead and missing amounted to 66. Flood in Fukuoka Prefecture: Chikugogawa Area The Chikugo River (Á≠ëÂæåÂ∑ù, Chikugo-gawa) flows through Kumamoto, Oita, Fukuoka and Saga prefectures in Japan. With a total length of 143 kilometres (89 mi), it is the longest river on Kyushu. It flows from Mount Aso and empties into the Ariake Sea. The river is important to industry, with twenty electrical power plants located along its banks, as well as the major city of Kurume in Fukuoka Prefecture. * 147 people were killed in the areas of Chikugo River; all areas of Tsukushi plain were flooded, and the Yoake dam which was under construction, the bank of Kasegawa, and the bank of Yabegawa, the area of Homan Gawa were also flooded. 80 percent of Kurume city was flooded; in the center of the city, water was 1 meter deep, 3 meters deep at the deepest. This flood is called one of the three worst floods, including that of 1890 and that of 1921. * The total damage amounted to ¬•79.3 billion, which was equivalent to twice the yearly budget of Fukuoka Prefecture. Damage The Japanese Government took appropriate measures comparable with those took for typhoons in 1948. The 5th Yoshida Cabinet (Government) placed \\"Nishinihon (West Japan) flood countermeasure center\\" in Fukuoka City. Not only National Safety Forces(which later became Land Force), but also American soldiers helped.

The causes were attributed to reckless deforestation, and the lack of water control after the second world war. The damaged Yoake Dam was investigated but the inadequate water control of the upper river was found to blame. The Japanese Government decided to follow America and its Tenessey Valley Corporation and started to build many dams such as, Matsubara Dam, Shimauch Tsutsumi (Chikugo River), Shimouke Dam (Tsue River), ≈åishi, Harazuru, Sennenbunsuiro (Chikugo River), Chikugoooseki, Terauchi Dam (Sata River), Ishiharagawa Dam, ≈åishi Dam, Jouharagawa Dam, Hyugakami Dam, Masubuchi Dam, Aburagi Dam, and Jin-ya Dam. In 2009, the countermeasures were again under review in view of the global warming and heat island phenomenon and the outbreaks of heavy rainfall in Northern Kyushu in 2009.

He began his career working with artist Roberto Montenegro then moved into publishing and education. His work was recognized with two Guggenheim Fellowships, the Jos√© Guadalupe Posada medal and membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Life Fern√°ndez Ledesma was born in 1900 into a large family of intellectuals in Aguascalientes. Even before he went to art school, he and friend Francisco D√≠az de Le√≥n founded a group called the C√≠rculo de Artistas Independentes in Aguascalientes in 1915, a forum through which they organized exhibitions. In 1917, he received a scholarship from the state government of Aguascalientes to attend the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (National School of Fine Arts) in Mexico City. There he studied under Leandro Izaguierre, Carlos Lazo and Saturnino Herran. To earn money to live on as a student, he worked as a calligrapher's assistant and then by tracing agricultural property plans at the Archivo General de la Naci√≥n. Fern√°ndez Ledesma married Isabel Villase√±or, an icon of Mexico's postrevolutionary period. They had one daughter, Olinca. Fern√°ndez Ledesma died in 1983 in Mexico City. Career Tiles created by the artists at the former church He was a painter, muralist, engraver, photographer, writer, editor, designer and researcher of Mexican handcrafts and folk art. Fern√°ndez Ledesma began his career working on projects related to the government, often collaborating or assisting Roberto Montenegro. In the early 1920s, he was commissioned by then education minister Jos√© Vasconcelos to create modern tile designs for the church of the former monastery of San Pedro y San Pablo. He chose to revive Puebla Talavera tiles for this task. In 1922, he went to Rio de Janeiro as an assistant to Montenegro to design the murals that decorated the walls of the Mexican pavilion for the 1922 Centenary Exposition in Rio de Janeiro . When he returned from Brazil, education minister Jos√© Vasconcelos, appointed him artistic director of the Ceramics Pavilion at the faculty of Chemical Science. Most of the rest of Fern√°ndez Ledesma's career was related to publishing and education. In 1924, again with Montenegro, he illustrated an edifying book of Lecturas cl√°sicas para ni√±os and contributed to the El Maestro magazine and began a printing workshop to promote the development of engraving in Mexico. In 1926, he started a magazine called Forma, sponsored by the government about fine arts in Mexico, remaining as its editor for several years. In the 1920s, he also worked as an illustrator for the weekly magazine El Universal Ilustrado. In 1935, he became head of the editorial offices at the Secretar√° de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. Fern√°ndez Ledesma edited and published several books on Mexican popular art, including Juguetes Mexicanos, published in 1929. His relationship with art education began in 1925, as a drawing teacher with the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica and, then in 1926 at the Centro de Arte Popular. After rejecting the director's position at one of the Escuelas de Pintura al Aire Libre, Fern√°ndez Ledesma, his brothers and Guillermo Ruiz decided to create the Escuela de Escultura y Talla Directo a school for sculpture and carving. The school challenged the idea of art for art's sake, focusing on handcrafts and popular art, and teaching workers and children. In 1928, he was one of the founding member of the \\"¬°30-30!\\" movement along with Fernando Leal and Ram√≥n Alva de Canal. This group was noted for its hostility to academia, trying to change how art students were taught, and its conviction that art should have a social purpose above all else. Fern√°ndez Ledesma also organized exhibition of Mexican art abroad. In 1929, he was sent to Spain, in charge of an exhibition of work from students at the Escuelas de Pintura al Aire Libre and the Centro de Arte Popular to the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in Seville . In 1940, he and Miguel Covarrubias prepared an exhibition called 20 Centuries of Mexican Art which was shown in New York. He was a founding member of Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (League of Revolutionary Writers and Artists) in 1934 and with the support of the Ministry of Public Education, exhibited his colleagues¬¥work in Paris in 1938 under the title Artdans la vie politique mexicaine (Art in the Political Life in Mexico). Recognitions for his work include a 1942 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for non-fiction. and another in 1969. In 1975, he received the Jos√© Guadalupe Posada medal in Aguascalientes, and in 1982, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a retrospective of his work called Artista y promotor cultural.

The Laws have undergone significant changes since pioneers of the sport broke away from the Rugby football establishment in 1895. The sport has been described as a \\"constantly evolving animal, particularly with professional coaches, [with which] the rules have to keep pace\\". Laws The current Laws of the Game and Notes on the Laws are set out in 17 sections: * Section 1: Playing Field * Section 2: Glossary * Section 3: Ball * Section 4: Player and Players' Equipment * Section 5: Mode of Play * Section 6: Scoring * Section 7: Timekeeping * Section 8: Kick-off and Drop-out * Section 9: Touch and Touch in-Goal * Section 10: Knock-on and Forward Pass * Section 11: Tackle and Play- the-Ball * Section 12: Scrum * Section 13: Penalty Kick * Section 14: Offside * Section 15: Misconduct * Section 16: Referee and Touch Judges * Section 17: Referee's Signals The current 17 sections, which include notes, are detailed in fewer than 50 pages and around 17,000 words. The Laws therefore have some flexibility to enable decisions to be made without the need to amend them. For example, Section 15, Law 1 (i) considers behaviour \\"in any way contrary to the true spirit of the game\\" to be misconduct.RLIF, 2004: 38 That law has been used to prevent chicken-wing tackling techniques, for example. Origins=Rugby football The rules of football as played at Rugby School in the 19th century were decided regularly and informally by the pupils. For many years the rules were unwritten. In 1845 three pupils at the school, William Delafield Arnold, Walter Waddington Shirley and Frederick Leigh Hutchins were tasked with writing a codified set of rules by the then Head Schoolboy and football captain Isaac Gregory Smith. The three pupils submitted 37 rules which were approved on 28 August 1845. Another pupil, Charles Harcourt Chambers, illustrated the Rules. The Rules played at the school continued to develop over time and as pupils left they took with them the game as they had played it. In 1871, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded with the purpose of standardising the rules for the clubs playing the Rugby style of football in England. The RFU invited three former pupils, all lawyers, to write the standardised rules, and they titled their work as laws. In June of that year the first Laws of the Game were approved. Unions were formed to govern the game in other countries but the English RFU continued to control the Laws until 1885. In 1884, there had been a dispute over the rules between the English and Scottish unions after a match between the two countries; this led to the formation of the International Rugby Football Board in 1886 with the intention of settling such disputes. The RFU refused to join and in 1887 the members of the new organisation, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, stated that no matches would be played against England until the RFU joined and accepted its rules. In 1890 the RFU joined and in 1892 a significant revision of the laws took place. Rugby league From 1895, the year of the schism in the game, the laws of rugby league were initially referred to as \\"Northern Union\\" rules, after the new governing body, and were a slight variation on the rules of rugby football as played at that time. What began as modifications to make the competition more entertaining to spectators continued until a distinct sport had emerged. Initially the rules were decided by the Northern Rugby Football Union, today's Rugby Football League, the governing body for rugby league in the United Kingdom. As the sport spread to around the world, other rugby leagues were established, notably in Australia, France and New Zealand, a more international approach was adopted. In 1948, the International Rugby League Board (IRLB) was formed. Initially the RFL retained this responsibility for the Laws while it was seen how the new Board would develop. The IRLB was invested with responsibility for the Laws later. During the Super League war, a dispute over media rights and the control of the game originating in Australia, the laws of rugby league were altered by the rival factions, the IRLB and its only remaining member, the Australian Rugby League, and the Super League International Board and its members. Since 1998 when the different sides reunited, the Laws have been the responsibility of the Rugby League International Federation. History of changes to the Laws The Northern Rugby Football Union inherited the existing laws of rugby football, as played until that time by its member clubs. The NRFU immediately made changes. In addition to the time before 1948 when an international governing body was established, members of the International Federation and its predecessors have had the authority to make significant changes to the Laws applied within their jurisdiction. The following is an incomplete list of changes made to the laws of rugby league since the 1895 schism. Changes to the laws used for senior competitions within the jurisdictions of RLIF members with test nation status are included here. 1890s ;1895: NRFU * During the inaugural season of rugby league, the rules were changed to require the scrum-half to retire behind a scrum until the ball was out.Fagan, 2007: 351 The scrum-half would now be deemed offside if they moved past their team's forwards while the ball was in the opposing pack.Fagan, 2007: 365 When the game was introduced to Australia several years later, the change was noted by The Sydney Sportsman on 15 April 1908 to \\"make the game fast and open\\" as it allowed the side that wins the contest for the ball to mobilise their backs \\"without interference\\". Before this a scrum-half had been permitted to follow the ball as it progressed through the packed forwards of their opponents half of the scrum. ;1896: NRFU * If a team committed a deliberate knock-on a free kick would now be awarded to the opposing team. Previously a scrum would have been formed in such an event. * The scrum-half feeding the ball into the scrum was required to do so from the same side of the scrum as the referee was positioned. ;1897: NRFU * The options presented to a team as a means to restart play after the ball had been kicked into touch were changed. The line-out was abolished and replace with the punt-out. The team would now be able to choose whether to have a scrum or a punt-out (also known as a \\"kick-in\\"), where previously the options had been to have a scrum or a line-out. A punt-out was taken from the touch-line by a player who could kick the ball back into play, in any direction. *In order to promote the scoring of tries: ** The value of a drop goal was reduced from four points to two points. ** The value of a penalty goal was reduced from three points to two points. ** The value of a goal from mark was reduced from four points to two points. ** The value of a field goal was reduced from four points to two points.Fagan, 2007: 393 ;1899: NRFU * The location of the restart after a try had been scored, either a place-kick if the try had been converted or a drop-kick if the try-scoring team was unable to convert, was moved from the line of the non-scoring team to the halfway line. * After a player had been tackled a loose scrum was now ordered formed to allow the ball to be brought back into play. 1900s ;1900: NRFU * Defenders were banned from charging players attempting a place-kick at goal. * The location at which a penalty was awarded against a defender that had obstructed a kicker after the ball had been kicked was changed from where the incident took place to where the ball had landed. ;1901: NRFU * Should a player go into touch while in possession of the ball play would now be restarted with a scrum rather than a punt-out. The punt-out was retained for those times when the ball was kicked into touch. * The knocking-on rule was altered. While trying to catch the ball, a player would now be permitted to \\"juggle\\" it, i.e. the ball could be re-gathered if it had not been caught cleanly in the first attempt to take possession. Previously a \\"clean catch\\" had been required, except in instances when the ball moved backwards after touching the hands or arms, because a knock to the ball causing forward movement was classed a knock-on.Fagan, 2007: 352 * Another change to the knock-on rule meant, provided that the ball did not touch the ground, play would continue uninterrupted if a player dropped the ball into the hands of a player on the opposing team. ;1902: NRFU * The punt-out, or kick-in, was abolished. In the event of the ball being kicked into touch, play would restart with a scrum infield. ;1903: NRFU * Kicking the ball into touch on the full, i.e. without the ball bouncing inside the field of play before going into touch, was no longer allowed for any kick except a penalty kick. ;1904: NRFU * A team could no longer position more than three players in the front row of a scrum. Previously there had been no restrictions on how many members of a team could join the front row. * The knocking-on rule was adjusted so that in the event the non-offending team picked up the ball after their opponents had knocked-on, and even if it had touched the ground, play would continue. ;1906: NRFU * The play-the-ball rule was introduced. Previously after each tackle had been completed or a player had been \\"held\\" the rules mandated that a scrum be ordered by the referee. These scrums had taken up a significant portion of game time and it was felt that the ball was hidden from spectators too often as a result, diminishing the game's entertainment value. The play-the-ball restored the early rugby football principle that play does not carry on when the player is no longer standing, but that a tackle is complete when a player is \\"held\\" on the ground or while on their feet. The Yorkshire Post commented on 13 June 1906 that the proposals, \\"provided in effect for a return to the 'play the ball' rule\\". In New Zealand, a newspaper column in The Truth on 10 November 1906 while describing the sport to its readers wrote, \\"the most excellent rule, that was obliterated from the earlier laws of the Union has again been introduced, 'That a player, when collared, must put the ball into play'.\\" * The number of players on each team was reduced from fifteen to thirteen. * If a ball was kicked out of play on the full, a scrum back where it had been kicked from would now be formed. ;1909: NSWRFL * Teams were restricted from placing more than three players in the front row of a scrum; the other rows remained unrestricted.ARL, 2008: 1908‚Äì17 1920s ;1920: NSWRFL * A scrum-half was now required to feed the ball into the scrum.ARL, 2008: 1918‚Äì27 ;1922: NSWRFL * The goal from mark after a fair catch was abolished. * The 'field goal', which could be scored in open play by kicking a loose ball above the cross bar and between the posts, was abolished. ;1926: NSWRFL * The goal-line drop-out replaced drop-outs from the line after the ball was played dead by a defender. * A new version of the play-the-ball was created which consisted of two players from each team. The ball was contested by only the defending marker and tackled player who was playing the ball, the marker was required to keep both feet on the ground until the ball was dropped or placed. The other two players stood ready act as halfback should their teammate win the contest. ;1927: RFL * Play-the-ball rules were amended for the 1927‚Äì28 season with the 1926 Australian development in which the play-the-ball consisted of two defensive markers, the tackled player and the acting half-back. 1930s ;1931: NSWRFL * The defending halfback would now feed the scrum, while the attacking side would have the loose-head. Previously, the player that fed the scrum had been the attacking halfback. * It became mandatory for each team's forwards to pack-down into the scrum in a 3‚Äì2‚Äì1 formation. * Scrums now had to be set a minimum of from the touch line and a minimum of from goal line. * Players who were off-side at the time of the play-the-ball would now be penalised if they did not make an attempt to get on-side and interfere with or obstruct an opposing player. ;1932: NSWRFL * A loose-arm rule is introduced, hookers must now place both arms over the props next to them. * The penalty was changed to allow a team awarded one to have the option of having a scrum rather than a 'free kick'. 1940s ;1948: NSWRFL * The opposing front rows in a scrum were prevented from packing down against each other until ordered to do so by the referee.ARL, 2008: 1948‚Äì57 1950s ;1950: RFL * The field goal, which was scored by kicking a loose ball above the cross bar and between the posts, was abolished from the laws. ;1951: NSWRFL * A ruck rule was introduced and applied to both teams, previously there had been a 'no-yard' ruck rule. This rule change lasted just one season. ;1952: NSWRFL * The no-yard ruck rule was reinstated. * The dummy-half and second-marker were required to stand behind the two men contesting the play-the-ball. ;1954: NSWRFL * The tap penalty was introduced. * A team conceding a penalty was required to retire . ;1956: NSWRFL * A ruck rule replaced the no-yard ruck rule and was applicable to both teams. * No minimum distance replaced the minimum that the dummy-half and second-marker had previously had to stand behind their teammates contesting the play-the-ball. ;1959: NSWRFL * The tap penalty was abolished.ARL, 2008: 1958‚Äì67 1960s ;1961: NSWRFL * In an effort to discourage incessant and purposeless runs by the dummy-halves, a rule was made that should the dummy- half be tackled after running with the ball there would be a scrum. ;1963: NSWRFL * The rule that a dummy-half caught with ball would result in a scrum was rescinded. Dummy-half runs were now unrestricted. * The ball leaving the scrum was required to come out behind the second-rowers. * The non-offending team would now be given the loose-head and feed at a scrum resulting from a penalty, this included after the team had kicked into touch. * Teams were allowed to replace a maximum of two injured players during the first half of a match and including halftime. ;1964: NSWRFL * Scrums would now be set a minimum of from the goal-line. * A place kick from the halfway line was used for the kick-off restarting play after an unconverted try. * A penalty on halfway would now be awarded if a kick-off went out on the full. ;1966: NSWRFL * A ruck rule, applying to both teams, was implemented; an increase from . RFL * A four-tackle rule was introduced in December 1966.Top ten: Rugby league rules, Rugby League World, Aug 2009: 61 The rule ended unlimited tackles, a by-product from the introduction of the play-the-ball in 1906.Bottom ten: Rugby league rules, Rugby League World, Aug 2009: 62 The sport's administrators were concerned that teams were becoming obsessed with retaining possession, as it was possible to keep the ball for long periods, to the detriment of the game being an exciting spectacle.Middleton, 2008: 27 A match between Hull Kingston Rovers and Huddersfield was a catalyst for this significant change; after Huddersfield kicked off, they were only able to touch the ball twice during the whole of the first half of the game. Rugby Football League secretary Bill Fallowfield devised and proposed the four- tackle rule with Australian authorities supporting the change as they were experiencing similar concerns for the game in Australia and wanted to improve the game's flow and pace.Middleton, 2008: 28 The change had a significant impact on the style of play and helped to create a product suited to television. ;1967: NSWRFL * The four-tackle rule was introduced to replace unlimited tackles. * The tap penalty was reintroduced following its withdrawal in 1959. * Scrums were replaced by a tap kick at restarts following penalty kicks into touch. ;1968: NSWRFL * Defending teams would restart with a optional kick should an attacking team make the ball dead.ARL, 2008: 1968‚Äì77 ;1969: NSWRFL * The front-row were required to pack 'square' in scrums. 1970s ;1970: NSWRFL * Two injured players were allowed to be replaced at any time during a game, provided that the replacements had played at least half of a lower-grade game that day. *If a player goes down injured the ball is simply given to a teammate to play rather than the game being halted so a doctor can be called onto the field. ;1971: NSWRFL * Value of a drop goal was reduced from two points to one point. * The six-tackle rule was introduced, replacing the four-tackle rule. ;1972: RFL * The six-tackle rule was introduced for the 1972‚Äì73 season with the aim of alleviating the \\"disjointed\\" play experienced with the four-tackle rule. 1980s ;1981: NSWRFL * Temporary suspensions of players, known as the \\"sin-bin\\", are introduced for misconduct.ARL, 2008: 1978‚Äì87RLIF, 2004: 42 * The differential scrum penalty is introduced. * Four replacements of players on the field are allowed during matches. ;1982: NSWRFL * Loose-head and feed were now given to non-offending team at the scrum. ;1983: NSWRFL * The value of try was increased from three points to four points. * The handover was introduced if a team was caught in possession after the sixth tackle. This replaced the scrum in this situation. ;1986: NSWRL * A restart was given when the ball was caught on the full in the in-goal area by a member of the defending team. ;1987: NSWRL * The 'Head-bin' was introduced for players suffering minor head injuries. The injured players were allowed to return to the field of play after 10 minutes without affecting team's quota of replacements. * A team that kicked the ball into touch in own half of the field, up to the fourth tackle, was awarded the ball feed at the following scrum. This rule was suspended before the 1987 NSWRL season play- offs. ;1988: NSWRL * Two fresh replacements were now allowed, previously they had had to have played in a lower-grade game earlier.ARL, 2008: 1988‚Äì97 ;1989: NSWRL * The use of the handover was extended to those occasions on the sixth tackle when the attacking team knocked on, kicked out on the full, or ran into touch. * When a scrum took place, all players standing outside it, apart from the halfback, had to stand a minimum of back to be onside. 1990s ;1990: NSWRL * In-goal touch judges were introduced for the finals series. * Any players chasing their team's kick from an offside position were required to remain away from the opponent taking possession of the ball. This was an increase from . ;1991: NSWRL * A penalty would now be given against a defender guilty of stripping the ball from opponent in possession. * The interchange rule was introduced, it allowed four players, consisting of up to two fresh reserves and a minimum of two players who had played half a game of the preceding Reserve Grade or President's Cup, unlimited interchanges during a match. The rule's main purpose was to reduce the risk of blood-borne diseases being spread but an angry public reaction forced a modification in April. The rule changed to allow a total of four players to be available for a maximum of six interchanges during a match. Players sent to the 'blood-bin' would not count among these six interchanges. ;1993: IRLB * A new definition was agreed for a high tackle which stated that it was illegal to make contact with the head or neck whether it was done \\"intentionally, recklessly or carelessly\\". Some coaches, such as Tim Sheens, voiced concerns that the rule was flawed because it would penalise accidental contact with the head or neck but Mick Stone, the NSWRL referees coaching co-ordinator, dismissed this stating accidental contact was not necessarily covered by the definition of \\"intentionally, recklessly, or carelessly\\". * The ball could be fed into the scrum providing that it entered between the opposing front-rowers' outside feet. This change meant referees would no longer need to check that the scrum half had put the ball into the middle of the scrum tunnel. Mick Stone said the new ruling gave referees \\"a very tangible line to look at\\". Stone said, \\"if the ball [enters] behind the front-rowers' foot, bang, it's a penalty\\". Stone believed that the ruling was an improvement on the situation during the previous season in Australia when the ball was being fed \\"under the second- rowers' or locks' (loose-forward) feet\\", he believed the change would \\"allow the halfback (scrum-half) a fair amount of latitude\\" while giving \\"the side without the feed a look at the ball\\". NSWRL * The distance the defensive line were taken back by the referee at the play-the-ball would now be measured from where the tackled player places the ball to play it. Previously the distance had been measured from the back foot of the marker but Mick Stone, the referees coaching coordinator, felt that this led to \\"fives\\" of varying lengths depending on where the markers stood. * The defensive line at the play-the-ball would now be taken back instead of to compensate for the change in the position the distance was measured from. The distance was amended mid- season. * A offside rule was introduced mid-season for non-markers on the defending team at the play-the-ball, amending the rule introduced at the beginning of the season. ;1994: RFL * Referees were given the power to put a player suspected of foul play \\"on report\\" with the incident to be reviewed later by the disciplinary panel. The system was based on the one already operating in Australian rugby league. Referees signalled that an incident had been put \\"on report\\" by crossing their raised arms above their heads. * In- goal judges were trialled, these two additional match officials are positioned behind the dead-ball line at each end of the playing field and aim to aid the referee in judging if a try has been scored. The in-goal judges had been used in Australia for two years. * Referees penalised defending players lifting attackers in the tackle in a way that could lead to an illegal spear tackle. ;1996: SLIB * The video referee was used for the first time. The video referee could be used when the match referee was not sure a try had been scored and wanted to check if a player had stayed in the field of play, if the player had grounded the ball correctly, double movements, if there had been any obstruction, and whether the players involved in the \\"immediate passage leading up the potential try being scored\\" were onside or offside. ARL * Unlimited interchanges were re-introduced. RFL * Scrums were now to be set from the touch-line, with the aim of creating attacking opportunities. * At the restart after a try had been scored and the conversion attempt had been taken, the side that scored now kicked off to the other team. This change aimed to make contests more even by almost guaranteeing possession for the side that had conceded points. Greg McCallum, the director of referees' coaching, also noted that this convention was \\"in line with most other sports\\" and \\"that is significant when we come to promoting the game in America and Asia\\". * At the play-the-ball, the side not in possession was barred from striking for the ball. This was an attempt to clean up the ruck. * At the play-the-ball, the tackled player was stopped from being able to tap the ball forwards to himself ‚Äì even in the absence of markers. ;1997: ARL * Striking by the defending marker at the play-the-ball was banned. * The requirement for the attacking team to stand a minimum distance behind dummy-half at the play- the-ball was ended. * The 40/20 rule was introduced to reward accurate kicking in general play and to disrupt the pattern of teams having turns at sets of six tackles. The rule gave the loose head and feed at the resulting scrum to a team that kicked the ball from behind their line so that it bounced in the field of play before going into touch behind their opponent's line. The rule also encouraged the defenders, usually wingers and fullbacks, to make a play for the ball instead of allowing it to leave play. * New guidelines were introduced to combat 'dangerous throws'. * Tackled players were banned from playing the ball forward to themselves. There was some concern that this could stifle play if a supporting teammate was slow to move into the dummy-half position to allow a play-the-ball. SL (A) * The video referee used. * The zero tackle rule was introduced. Defending teams were given an extra tackle when they received the ball if their player ran it back rather than allowing the ball to leave play if, for example, the attacking team kicked the ball. This was an attempt to reward positive play and break the cycle of teams taking turns to have six tackles. * Tackled players were banned from playing the ball forward to themselves. As with the equivalent change by the ARL, there was some concern that this could stifle play. * The kick-off following points being scored was altered so that the non-scoring team was to receive the kick. One intention of this change was to \\"narrow the gap between good and bad teams\\". ;1998: NRL * The Zero tackle was adopted for the unified competition.ARL, 2008: 1998-07 * The video referee was adopted. ;1999: RFL * The 40/20 rule was introduced. The 40/20 had been used in Australia since 1997. 2000s ;2001: NRL * A defending player jumping to catch the ball from an opponent's kick cannot be tackled mid-air. This rule was brought in due to safety consideration. The rule allows for defending players to tackle the attacking players in the air. There had been concerns from coaches that allowing an attacker to land with the ball before attempting a tackle could result in \\"uncontested tries\\" or a penalty try if a tackle was attempted while they were in the air; either of these scenarios was considered against the principles of the game. * A team that finds touch with a kick from a optional restart is awarded the loose head and feed at the scrum. * If from a kick anywhere on the field, the defending team takes the ball dead, for example if they place one foot over the dead ball line before playing at the ball, the team must restart play with a goal-line drop-out. * The defending team were allowed to strip the ball in the tackle if no more than two tacklers were in attendance. * Limited interchanges were reintroduced, a maximum of 12 interchanges were now allowed using a pool of 4 replacements. RFL * restarts should be allowed to happen quickly and not be delayed by referees. * The first and second halves would end the moment that the hooter sounds, in the past referees could use their discretion to let play continue if they felt the siren had sounded during play. ;2003: RFL * The knock-on rule was modified so that if in the referee's judgement a player did not play at the ball, a knock- on would not be given. * New interchange and substitution rules were introduced. The number of interchanges, which now included blood bins, increased from 6 to 12 using a pool of 4 substitutes. This change aimed to retain the element of wearing down a team's opponents during the game ‚Äì which was considered part of the character of the sport. Stuart Cummings, the Rugby Football League's technical controller said the changes \\"bring us into line with the international rules\\" and ruled out future increases as well as declaring, \\"We will never see the unlimited interchange introduced into rugby league in Britain,\\" a change that had caused controversy in Australia during its experiment there. ;2004: NRL * Should an attacking player be held up by defenders in-goal, they should carry on play with a play-the-ball on the line. ;2006: NRL * Taps from penalty kicks to touch were now to be taken infield. ;2008: NRL * The maximum number of interchanges that could be made from a pool of four replacements was reduced from 12 to 10. * A second tackler was now permitted to strip the ball if the attacker carrying it was attempting to place ball for a try. RFL * If a team kicks the ball from a restart and the ball bounces into touch or over the dead ball line they will be given head and feed at the resulting scrum. * In the scrum the ball can no longer be trapped by the loose forward in an attempt to catch the opposition offside. If the scrum moves forwards and the ball comes from between and behind the inner feet of the second row forwards it will be deemed to be out of the scrum. * Defenders, excluding the markers at a play-the-ball, must stand with both feet behind the referee's front foot to be judged onside. * If over their try-line the defenders steal the ball from the attacking team when there is more than one defender involved in the tackle a penalty will be given rather than a penalty try. ;2009: NRL * An assistant on-field referee was introduced. * A penalty can be applied by the referee against a defender where the attacking kicker has been tackled whilst they are in the air. * The tap from penalty kick to touch to be taken infield. 2010s ;2010: RFL * Referees would now call \\"held\\" if one of the ball-carrier's legs was lifted by a defender in a tackle in which the participants were stood upright. Previously, a referee would only declare the tackle complete if both legs had been lifted. The change was intended to increase player safety. * Referees now called held as soon as they see the ball-carrier being dragged by more than one defender. This rule interpretation was intended to increase player safety by preventing groups of defenders dragging an opponent into touch or the in-goal area. NRL * During the 2010 season, a rule change to the playing field was implemented so that if a player in possession of the ball made contact with the corner post that player would no longer be considered to be touch in-goal. Proponents of the move argued a series a possible future scenarios made this preventative measure necessary, with ARL chief executive Geoff Carr stating, \\"no one has thought of the possibility of using the corner post as a weapon to defuse a try and we want to stop it before they do\\". One scenario was that a defending player might manipulate the corner post to put an attacker out of play. Another concern cited was that the corner post might be made to make contact with a rolling ball to ensure the defending team gains possession with a 20-metre restart. Corner posts, which sometimes lean to one side, have no upper height limit set and this led to a fear that corner posts might become \\"long rubber snakes, biting attackers and sending them into touch\\", in the words of Roy Masters. Other laws concerning the corner posts remained unchanged. A ball that makes contact with the corner post while not in the possession of a player will be deemed to be touch in-goal as before. There was no attempt to remove the corner posts from the playing field as they are used to promote sponsors and are also a useful aid for players to judge their kicks. The change was agreed by the NRL Board and approved by the RLIF as an experimental rule. Implementation occurred mid-season following feedback from clubs. ;2011: RFL * A new stricter variation on the ruck and holding down was introduced in 2011. When the referee calls \\"held\\" and \\"move\\", the tackle is deemed to be completed, and any further infringement from that point on in the ruck is penalised. ;2012: RFL * Teams will now only be able to make 10 interchanges in a match which has been reduced from 12. * If a player in possession of the ball hits the corner flag he will no longer be deemed 'In Touch'. * After a try, teams now have the option of taking the conversion as a drop-kick instead of from a tee. ;2013: RFL * The advantage rule was changed. ;2019: RFL * The number of interchanges a team can make was reduced from 10 to 8. * Shot clocks are introduced in an attempt to speed up play and teams will be penalised if they take more than 35 seconds to form a scrum and more than 30 seconds to take a drop-out. * \\"Golden point\\" extra time rule was introduced, where after 80 minutes, if a game was drawn, then 10 minutes of extra time was played until one team scored the winning point(s).

Known as Broomes Island Road, the route runs from Oyster House Road at Broomes Island north to MD 2/MD 4 in Port Republic. MD 264 connects the central Calvert County communities of Broomes Island, Island Creek, and Mutual with the county's main highway at Port Republic. The state highway was constructed in the early 1920s. Route description View north along MD 264 in Broomes Island MD 264 begins at the intersection of Ballard Rogers Road and Oyster House Road in Broomes Island. Ballard Rogers Road continues south to the end of the peninsula between Island Creek and the Patuxent River that contains the village of Broomes Island, a former oyster canning center. MD 264 heads north as a two-lane undivided road out of the village through a mix of farmland and forest toward the community of Island Creek, where the highway intersects Parkers Wharf Road and Williams Wharf Road. In the village of Mutual, the state highway intersects MD 265 (Mackall Road) and Laveille Road, which leads west to the historic home La Veille. North of Mutual, MD 264 passes Christ Church, which with a founded date of 1672 is the oldest church in Calvert County. The state highway passes a spur of old alignment, Yoes Corner Road (unsigned MD 264A), and reaches its northern terminus at a directional crossover intersection with MD 2/MD 4 (Solomons Island Road) in Port Republic. There is no direct access between MD 264 and MD 765 (St. Leonard Road), which meets the northbound direction of MD 2/MD 4 at an adjacent right-in/right-out intersection. History MD 264 was constructed as a gravel road around 1923. The state highway followed the alignment of Yoes Corner Road to MD 2/MD 4 until the northern end was moved opposite the northern terminus of the St. Leonard - Port Republic segment of MD 765 around 1985. MD 264's northern terminus was changed from a standard intersection to a directional crossover intersection in 2006.

The Ordre de l'Union Parfaite was created by Queen consort Sophie Magdalene of Denmark and Norway on August 7, 1732, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of her happy marriage with King Christian VI of Denmark and Norway. Given to both men and women, L'Union Parfaite was the first Dano-Norwegian order. Its motto was In felicissim√¶ Unionis Memoriam (\\"In Commemoration of the Happiest [Marital] Union\\"). Conferral of the Order ceased after the death of the Queen on May 7, 1770. The French name can be translated as Order of the Perfect Union or Order of Friendship. The use of French was not unusual in the eighteenth century royal Danish court or in Sophie Magdalene's German homeland, where other such examples exist, such as the Ordre pour le M√©rite and the Ordre de la Sinc√©rit√©.  Insignia  Badge, Ordre de l'Union Parfaite The badge or \\"jewel\\" of the Order was a white enamelled cross, each arm of which was capped by a golden crown. Between the arms, a golden Norwegian lion bearing a golden, white-shafted halberd alternated with a red-enamelled, golden-headed Brandenburg eagle. A blue oval medallion, encircled by diamonds, imposed on the center of the cross displayed the crowned intertwined monograms of Sophie Magdalene and Christian VI. The silk ribbon was dark blue, edged with silver (the ribbon has become discolored over the centuries, but the original hue can still be seen in numerous painted portraits of the recipients). Gentlemen wore the cross in a left buttonhole of their coats. Ladies bore it on their left breasts.

It was a present to Crown Prince Frederik (later Frederik VIII) and Crown Princess Louise in connection with their silver wedding anniversary in 1894. It depicts three storks about to set off. Since 1950, it has been a tradition that newly graduated midwives dance around the fountain. Various photos including one of midwives' dance. History In 1888, the Society for the Beautification of Copenhagen announced a competition for a fountain on the prominent square to celebrate the upcoming silver wedding anniversary of Crown Prince Frederik (VIII) and Crown Princess Louise on 28 July 1894. The competition was won by Edvard Petersen and Vilhelm Bissen. Another entry in the competition was Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll and Joakim Skovgaard's Dragon Fountain, which was later erected in the City Hall Square. Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint proposed a fountain depicting a merry Amager farmer sitting on a cabbagehead. The fountain was inaugurated in 1894. Design Detail The fountain's pedestal The fountain consists of a nine-sided basin of stone. It collects water from the bronze bowl at the top and the three small cascades around the edges of the central pedestal. The pedestal is decorated with reliefs of aquatic plants; in the basin, there are frogs sitting on dock leaves, spewing jets of water. On a shelf on the pedestal stand three storks ready to take flight in each of three different directions. A common urban legend holds that the birds depicted are herons. In 2008, representatives from the Danish Ornithological Society stated that this is not true and that the birds are indeed storks.  Colding-Jorgensen experiment  In early 2009, as part of a classroom experiment on viral communication, slacktivism, and social media, Anders Colding-J√∏rgensen, a lecturer from the University of Copenhagen, created a Facebook protest group against the demolition of the Stork Fountain. In a week it managed to attract 10,000 supporters and after two weeks it had 27,000 members. However, the cause was purely fictitious; there was no threat of demolition and the fountain is in fact a listed monument. Cultural references During the late 1960s, the fountain became a popular meetingplace for members of the protest movements. Danish folk singer C√¶sar received mainstream popularity with his protest song named Storkespringvandet (Stork Fountain) about police brutality. The song's lyrics, written by Th√∏ger Olesen, were set to the popular Scottish nursery rhyme Ally Bally Bee (Coulter's Candy).

Until recently, this species was regarded as a regional subpopulation of the similar-looking but much larger giant freshwater stingray (U. polylepsis) of Southeast Asia. Typically reaching across, the freshwater whipray has a distinctively shaped, rounded pectoral fin disc, a projecting snout, and a thin tail without fin folds. It is plain brown above and white below with dark marginal bands. Can occasionally go on land and can \\"breathe\\" out of water for up to 7 minutes. The freshwater whipray is an active hunter of small fishes and shrimps, and does not currently face substantial conservation threats. Taxonomy The first known specimen of the freshwater whipray was caught during a 1989 scientific expedition from the Daly River, after which it would eventually be named. Various authors have mistakenly referred to this ray as the estuary stingray (Dasyatis fluviorium), or identified it with the similar U. polylepsis. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies have since found that this species is in fact distinct from U. polylepsis, and it was formally described by Peter Last and B. Mabel Manjaji-Matsumoto in a 2008 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) paper. The type specimen is a juvenile male across, collected from the Pentecost River. Distribution and habitat The only Australian stingray confined to fresh and brackish waters, the freshwater whipray has been thus far been reported from the Daly, Fitzroy, Gilbert, Mitchell, Normanby, Ord, Pentecost, Roper, South Alligator, and Wenlock Rivers in northern Australia, and may well inhabit most large, tropical Australian rivers. The stingrays in the Fly River, Papua New Guinea, may also belong to this species. This bottom-dwelling species occurs at a depth of . Most individuals are found in water with a salinity of under 10 ppt, but some have been caught from water with a salinity of up to 30 ppt. Description The freshwater stingray has an apple-shaped pectoral fin disc approximately as wide as long, with the leading margins almost straight and transverse. The moderately long, obtuse snout is flattened with a pointed tip that projects from the disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. There is a broad, somewhat rectangular curtain of skin between the nares, with a subtly fringed posterior margin. The mouth is gently arched and contains a pair of large papillae near the center and 2-3 much smaller papillae near the corners. There are around 37 upper tooth rows and 45 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, each with a horizontal ridge and groove, and arranged with a quincunx pattern. The pelvic fins are small, no more than a fifth as long as the disc width. The tail tapers from a narrow base to become thin and whip-like, and measures more or less twice the disc length. There is a single serrated stinging spine on top of the tail; the fin folds are absent. The entire upper surface of the disc is densely covered by small dermal denticles that are heart or oval-shaped around the \\"shoulders\\" and become tiny and granular towards the disc margins; there are also around 5 relatively large denticles at the center of the disc. The tail is roughened by denticles above and below, with the largest positioned in a midline row before the spine. The dorsal coloration is a uniform light brown to gray-brown, darkening to blackish past the tail spine. The underside of the disc and tail is white, with dark brown bands around the fin margins; the inner margin of the band is irregular, breaking up into small blotches that reach the belly. This species attains a disc width of , but most do not exceed across. The freshwater whipray is close in appearance to the much larger giant freshwater stingray, but has a shorter, more obtuse snout and narrower dark ventral bands. The two species also differ in several morphometric and meristic characters. Biology and ecology Little is known of the freshwater whipray's natural history. It feeds on small fishes and shrimps, and has been observed charging up riverbanks and taking prey caught in its wash. There is a male specimen on record that was adolescent at a disc width of . Human interactions The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has noted that the prospects for freshwater whiprays in Australia are likely favorable. However, there is concern that the South Alligator River subpopulation in Kakadu National Park may be negatively affected by contaminants from exploratory uranium mines upstream.

The mountain plays a major role in the Inuit mythology of Pisissarfik. It is also important as an archaeological site.  Geography  The mountain is near the settlement of Kapisillit on the North bank of the Kapisillit Kangerluaq, a branch of the Nuup Kangerlua (), about 150 km northeast of the Greenlandic capital Nuuk. The inland side of the mountain is relatively smooth, but it forms a steep cliff by the coast. Pisissarfik is one of the most striking mountains of the region owing to its distinctive shape.  History  Until about AD 1350 farmsteads forming part of the Western Settlement (Vestribygg√∞) were situated along the Kapisillit- Fjord. At that time there were often conflicts with the local Inuit; it is believed that this fighting (along with changes in climate) was one of the reasons for the disappearance of Scandinavian settlers from the region, and eventually from the whole of Greenland. The Kalaallisut name 'Pisissarfik' means 'shooting range' and derives from a legend of that time.  Legends  An Inuk and a Viking are said to have climbed to the summit and held a shooting competition with bow and arrow on a seal pelt, stretched on a bank of the fjord. The Inuk won and pushed the loser off the cliff to his death. According to Inuit mythology, the final and decisive battle between the Nordic settlers and themselves took place at the foot of the mountain, and resulted in the extinction of the settlers. The people long considered numerous graves found at the bottom of the cliff to be those of people killed in this fight. However, scientists from the Danish National Museum, who examined the site between 1945 and 1952, found that they were in fact Inuit graves dating from the 16th to 17th century.  Archaeological Finds  The graves contained human corpses that had been preserved by natural mummification, as with those in Qilakitsoq. In one grave, three children were found, all under one year old. In another lay two women and two children, swathed in Reindeer skins. Even the clothing‚Äîanoraks made from bird and seal pelts, and Kamit (singular Kamik, seal skin boots)‚Äîwere well preserved. Pisissarfik played an important role in the Christianisation of the region in the 18th century: on Pentecost Sunday 1749 the first Deutsche Messe was celebrated at its foot.

Border Cave is a rock shelter on the western scarp of the Lebombo Mountains in KwaZulu-Natal near the border between South Africa and Swaziland. Border Cave has a remarkably continuous stratigraphic record of occupation spanning about 200 ka. Anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeletons together with stone tools and chipping debris were recovered. Dating by carbon-14, amino acid racemisation and electron spin resonance (ESR) places the oldest sedimentary ash at some 200 kiloannum. Excavations for guano in 1940 by a certain W. E. Barton of Swaziland, revealed a number of human bone fragments and were recognised as extremely old by Professor Raymond Dart, who had visited the site in July 1934, but had carried out only a superficial examination. In 1941 and 1942, a team sponsored by the University of the Witwatersrand carried out a more thorough survey. Subsequent excavations in the 1970s by Peter Beaumont were rewarded with rich yields. The site produced not only the complete skeleton of an infant, but also the remains of at least five adult hominins. Also recovered were more than 69,000 artifacts, and the remains of more than 43 mammal species, three of which are now extinct. Also recovered from the cave was the \\"Lebombo Bone\\", the oldest known artifact showing a counting tally. Dated to 35,000 years, it is a small piece of baboon fibula incised with 29 notches, similar to the calendar sticks used by the San of Namibia. Animal remains from the cave show that its early inhabitants had a diet of bushpig, warthog, zebra and buffalo. Raw materials used in the making of artifacts include chert, rhyolite, quartz, and chalcedony, as well as bone, wood and ostrich egg shells. The west-facing cave, which is near Ingwavuma, is located about 100 m below the crest of the Lebombo range and commands sweeping views of the Swazi countryside below. It is semi-circular in horizontal section, some 40 m across, and formed in Jurassic lavas as a result of differential weathering. A set of tools almost identical to that used by the modern San people and dating to 44,000 BP were discovered at the cave in 2012. These represent the earliest unambiguous evidence for modern human behaviour.Earliest' evidence of modern human culture found, Nick Crumpton, BBC News, 31 July 2012 In 2015, the South African government submitted a proposal to add the cave to the list of World Heritage Sites and it has been placed on the UNESCO list of tentative sites as a potential future 'serial nomination' together with Blombos Cave, Pinnacle Point, Klasies River Caves, Sibudu Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter.  Regional setting  Border cave is located at within the Kwazulu region. It is located from the border of Swaziland, and the cave faces west toward the Lowveld from the southern Lebombo Mountains. The Lebombos Mountains form an unusual mountainous arrangement that is interrupted by deep valleys and eastward slopes. The lowland flats have an elevation of . Border cave itself is situated roughly in elevation, just below the escarpment rim. The main rivers include Usuthu, Ngwavuma, and Pongolo Rivers, which all flow from West to East. They all cut through the mountains as superimposed streams, which form over horizontal beds of faulted rock, and they emerge in the Delagoa Bay. The super imposed streams erode the underlying beds. The Lowveld displays a younger erosional surface cut, and the Karro rocks, specifically the Stormberg basalts and Ecca shales, display older surfaces. The geomorphic setting is diverse, as the Lebombo rhyolites are poorly laminated, slightly banded with phenocrysts of feldspar and occasional quartz. The differences come from the different rates at which cooling and crystallization occurred in the different textural zones. There were slower rates of change during the later Pleistocene and a total absence of seepage water through the walls. Thus, it can be concluded that the opening of the caves took place during the Pleistocene  Environment = Current setting  Annual rainfall is approximately at Ingwavuma, which is roughly south of Border Cave. The vegetation in this area is described as a tree community with variable grasses depending on the soil depth. The climate in the region of Border Cave involves the summer-hot, mesothermal, winter-dry Cwa type in Koeppen, with a tropical savanna climate reaching Mozambique and the Coastal Plain. On the Lebombo Range, there are a few kilometers of bushes, scrub- forest, and forest form in a combination of low and high altitudes. Prominent species include Rauvolfia, Protorhus, Trichilia, and Combretum, accompanied by aloes, fig, and Euphorbiaceae. The grass species Eragrostis is prominent in Lowveld. Additionally, the area has acacia and marula trees, accompanied by Digitaria and Themeda grasses.  Findings  Small mammal evidence suggests that the vegetation of Border cave ranged from miombo savanna woodland or high rainfall miombo woodland to Lowveld, arid Lowveld, or mopane at various times during the Upper Pleistocene. Four general phases emerged. In the earliest period, the highest-rainfall miombo occurred. Annual rainfall was at least 25 % higher than today, but less than 10 % of rainfall occurred during the winter. There were high and relatively high mean annual temperatures, which are comparable to the current conditions found further north. Next, Zululand Thornveld, which occurs today has increased winter rainfall by between 20 % to 30 %. A mean daily range that is greater than the annual range is considered to be tropical climates. Additionally, frost is sporadic in the Lowveld, occurring every few years in lower altitude areas that have cold air drainage and strong inversions. Vegetation was very broad in the earlier Upper Pleistocene interval, ranging approximately from 125,000 to 35,000 B.P. There were five clearly defined layers containing cultural remains and distinct environmental differences (from older to younger): Middle Stone Age 1, Middle Stone Age 2, Middle Stone Age 3, Early Later Stone Age, and Iron Age. There were specific changes in the vegetation frequencies between the Middle Stone Age and Late Stone Age, and the difference was specifically quantifiable in the relative amounts of grass versus bush in the vegetational mosaic presented. There was more bush present in a majority of the Middle Stone Age 1 and 2 and the Early Late Stone Age. This is reflected in the climatic conditions being very different from the current climatic conditions. There was potentially more grass during the Middle Stone Age 3, which most likely reflects present climatic conditions. A good soil map is available for Swaziland, but soils in the KwaZulu section of the Lebombo Mountains have not been mapped. The basic soil type is brown, clay-like soil. On the basaltic terrain of the Lowveld, the clays are red to brown and well-structured. In flat, low-lying areas, the clays are black or charcoal with coarse blocky structures.  Middle Stone Age and transition to Early Late Stone Age  The study of bones from larger mammals provides knowledge about the features, and sequence at Border Cave during the Middle Stone Age and early Late Stone Age (c. 125,000 to 35,000 B.P.). Studies were conducted to understand people in the Middle Stone Age and Early Late Stone Age through animal bones and vegetation that they brought back to the site. Additionally, lithostratigraphic analysis of Border Cave provides significant information about when Border Cave was inhabited. Animal body part frequency data from Border Cave indicate the specific hunting patterns of people during the Middle Stone Age and Early Late Stone Age. The data suggest that residents brought back fully intact small animals, but only specific body parts of larger animal species. Additionally, the fauna found at Border Cave contains at least two or three extinct species. One of these is the Bond's springbok (Antidorcas bondi); the presence of this species suggests that the residents of Border Cave preferred open vegetational settings. Bond's springbok survived until approximately 38,000 B.P., specifically after the Later Stone Age people made their first appearance on Border Cave site. There is no evidence for differences in hunting practices between the Border Cave inhabitants during the Middle Stone Age and Late Stone Age. There was unusual stratigraphic and radiometric control at Border Cave, and these data indicate that Border Cave was not always inhabited. Border cave was occupied at different points in time, and each occupancy modified the sediment at Border Cave. One particular sedimentary sequence of interest was the early age of the Middle Stone Age at about 95,000 B.P., which was originally believed to align with the Upper Paleolithic. Instead, the Middle Stone Age at Border Cave was found to extend to the beginning of the Late Interglacial. A number of sedimentary sequences on the interior and the coast, including the Klasies River Mouth site in the southern Cape, the Bushman Rock Shelter, and Florisbad, support this sedimentary pattern presented at Border Cave. Additionally, a late Middle Pleistocene age for the earliest Middle Stone Age follows the uranium-series date of 174,000 B.P. Recovery of stone tools of the Howieson's Poort industry indicates the cultural and biological evolution in southern Africa that took place between the Middle Stone Age and Early Late Stone Age. Howieson's Poort industry was recovered at Klasies River Mouth and Border Cave from cold- climate deposites. This industry consists of small blades, backed crescents, trapezoids, and knives. Comparing Klasies River mouth and Border Cave deposits, more blades and geometric flakes from non-local cryptocrystalline siliceous rock were found in Klasies River Mouth and more blades of chalcedony were found in Border Cave. Finding blades of more modern technological materials displays an example of transitions made to the \\"Upper Paleolithic\\" lithic industry. Lithic assemblages of the post-HP and ELSA layers, in addition to existing and new radiocarbon dates, support that the Late Stone Age emerged in South Africa at approximately 44 ka. The Late Stone Age technology was preceded by a phase of progressive abandonment of the Middle Stone Age tool types, transitioning to simpler tools of the Late Stone Age.  San material culture  The analysis of organic artifacts from Border Cave drew insights to inhabitants in the Early Later Stone Age who used methods similar to those used by San hunter-gatherers. San hunter-gatherers were originally believed to have emerged 20,000 years ago, but findings in Border Cave, Boomplaas, Mumba, and Enkapune Ya Muto note otherwise. Artifacts found in Border Cave include notched bones, bone awls, wooden digging sticks, and bone points. The bone points are of particular interested because they reflect those used by the San hunter-gatherers as arrowheads. These bone points were decorated with a spiral groove filled with red ochre, which closely resembles the San decorations specifically used to identify their ownership of the arrowheads when hunting. Border Cave inhabitants 44 ka used technology and cultural symbols that reflect San material culture in the Late Stone Age. In addition to the bone points, the notched stick was similar to San poison applicators, and the notch stick actually retains residues of a heated toxic compound. Additionally, personal ornaments found in Border Cave consisted of large ostrich egg shells, which was commonly used for ornaments by the San people in the same time period as Boomplaas, Mumba, and Enkapune Ya Muto. Analyzing these artifacts confirms that the use of large ostrich egg shells, which were a typical San cultural personal ornament, dates back 45 ka by a number of African sites.  Fossil man in Lebombo Mountains  Adult human skull found in Border Cave.Human skeletal remains most likely associated with the Middle Stone Age of South Africa were found in Border Cave. The two human remains consisted of the partial cranium of an adult of approximately thirty years and the skeleton of an infant of about three months. Additionally, there were many other adult skeletal fragments found. These skeletal remains were found in an excavation of deposit focused on studying the agricultural purposes of Border Cave. This was when the initial skull and other adult fragments were found. After a second excavation focused on skeletal remains, the infant skeleton was found. The adult skull was less than in length, in breadth, and its auriculobregmatic height was at least . The forehead is of moderate height and has a gentle curve into the fault of the skull. The adult human skull is confidently associated with the lithic industry. Additionally, the association of rich fauna, including one or two extinct species, specifically the Springbok, with the lithic industry and the human remains was established by studying the infant skeleton.

Whilst retaining its original title as an \\"island\\", it has long been infilled to the shoreline of the suburb of Rozelle and connected by the Glebe Island Bridge (and its replacement the Anzac Bridge) to Pyrmont. History=Abattoirs and bridges The original Glebe Island Bridge, photographed in 1878‚Äì9, looking South West from Pyrmont to Rozelle Bay and Glebe Island (on Right). The rocky outcrop known as Glebe Island was originally accessible from the Balmain shoreline only at low tide, until a causeway was laid in the 1840s. Surveyor William Wells created a subdivision for the Balmain end of the island in 1841, with four intended streets and six sections containing a total of 86 lots.WH Wells, Plan of a Part of the Glebe Island Situated between Balmain, Pyrmont and The Glebe for Sale by Auction by Mr Stubbs on Monday 12 July 1841 The subdivision did not eventuate. In 1850‚Äì1854, Colonial Architect Edmund Blacket designed stone buildings for a public abattoir on the island. According to Joan Kerr, Blacket's chosen architecture was Norman in inspiration ‚Äì round-headed openings and simple decoration. Kerr states that the abattoir was almost certainly based on an American design. On 7 September 1860, Balmain Council resolved to approach the owners of the unsold parts of the Balmain Estate for a grant of land to build a road to the island.Balmain Council Minutes, minute 218, 7 September 1860 The Pyrmont Bridge Company built a low-level timber-framed bridge that connected the island to Pyrmont, and thus to the city, in 1862.Select Committee on the Pyrmont Bridge Company Bill (amended)', NSW Legislative Assembly Votes and Proceedings, 1858, vol 2; Pyrmont Bridge Co - half-yearly meeting, NSW Government Gazette, 1863, p 1619 The abattoirs featured prominently in the 1882 Royal Commission into noxious and offensive trades, instigated by complaints from Balmain and Glebe Point residents.\\"Report of the Royal Commission appointed on 20 November 1882, to inquire into the nature and operations of, and to classify noxious and offensive trades within the city of Sydney and its suburbs and to report generally on such trades; together with the Minutes of Evidence and Appendices ordered by the Council to be printed, 31 May 1863\\", Journal Legislative Council, NSW 1883, Second Session, vol 25, p 194.

Also in 1912 the Metropolitan Meat Industry Board resolved to abolish the abattoirs and build a new facility at Homebush. By 1915 Robert Saunders, the Pyrmont quarry master, had been commissioned to level the island to make it suitable for wharves. Saunders's firm dumped a great quantity of excavated ballast at the eastern end of the island for wharfage. Many cubic feet of quality dimension stone, however, were carefully cut away and almost certainly used for construction projects. Some 250 of Saunders's men were still working on the island in 1920. Glebe Island was an early success for the Harbour trust. Wharves were built on three sides of the levelled rocky outcrop from 1912. The reconstructed fourth side was attached to the Rozelle shoreline as part of the extensive reclamation of Rozelle Bay and White Bay which had begun in the 1890s.Land and Property Information NSW, Central Mapping Authority Sheets U0945-32, U0945-33, note 33 Glebe Island became the site of a grain elevator and tall concrete silos, operated from 1921 by the Grain Elevators Board of NSW.Peninsula Observer: the Balmain Association Incorporated news sheet, number 210, February 1992 The 1958 Australian Encyclopaedia records that the bulk wheat terminal had a capacity of 7,500,000 bushels (202,500 tonnes).\\"Ports and Harbours\\", Australian Encyclopaedia, Angus and Robertson, Sydney 1958, vol 7, p 211 During World War II much of the island was commandeered for the main United States army depot in Sydney.

Some silos were demolished, while from 1991 Australian Cement (now Cement Australia) used 16 of them as a bulk cement terminal. These are now heritage-listed. In the 1990s a high-level, cable-stayed, reinforced concrete six-lane bridge spanning 345 metres between two 120-metre towers was built above the older Allan-designed Glebe Island Bridge. The new bridge opened on 3 December 1995, and was also named Glebe Island Bridge. It was renamed Anzac Bridge in 1998. Until November 2008, the island was the Australian Amalgamated Terminals (AAT) facility for imported motor vehicles.Glebe Island showing a portion of silo complex and White Bay at left.

History The Haudenosaunee government has issued passports since at least 1923, when Haudenosaunee authorities issued a passport to Cayuga statesman Deskaheh to travel to the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva. The Iroquois passport evolved from negotiations with the U.S. State Department, Canada, Britain and other countries and has been used since 1977. In 2005 Japan allowed a delegation travelling on the Iroquois passport to visit that country for the World Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions. The Iroquois passport is not accepted for entry into Canada. In early 2010, a delegation from Kahnawake to an environmental conference in Bolivia was unable to return to Canada on the passport, stranding the group in El Salvador for several weeks before they were allowed, under escort, to transit via the United States. On June 18, 2011, another incident occurred at the Cornwall, Ontario port-of-entry into Canada when an Akwesasne Mohawk woman's Haudenosaunee passport was confiscated and a Certificate of Indian Status card had to be used to cross the border. When asked about this incident, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency confirmed that the Iroquois passport is not on Canada's list of acceptable identification. In July 2010 the United Kingdom did not accept the tribal passports of the Iroquois Nationals field lacrosse team for travel to the UK for the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship. The United States government offered to immediately issue United States passports to the team-members, and several days after this offer was rejected, issued waivers that would allow the team back into the U.S.; however, the U.K. continued to refuse to issue visas. In July 2018 Israel accepted the team's passports, subject to assurances from the Canadian government that they would be allowed back into Canada on them. Validity The validity of an Iroquois passport for various purposes has been questioned, and the issue is entangled with the larger issue of Iroquois sovereignty. In July 2010 the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois sovereigntist organization voiced its opposition to the validity of the passport, saying that a passport should only be issued by a country, not a nation. The Isle of Man has issued public warnings rejecting the document as a valid form of either identification or nationality and regards holders as U.S. or Canadian citizens, and the European Union does not recognise it as a valid travel document and has issued guidelines stating that visas cannot be affixed to the passport, barring holders from the Schengen area. Both list the Iroquois passport as a \\"fantasy passport\\", a document issued by a minority, sect, population group or private organization, which according to the Isle of Man has \\"no authority and to which no official recognition has been given\\". The governments in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada have refused to endorse the document as valid document for international travel. Additionally, the document does not appear on the list of acceptable identification to cross into Canada. The Iroquois passport has, however, been successfully used for international travel, though so has the novelty passport of the \\"Conch Republic\\" micronation. The passports do not currently meet the 2009 Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative requirements for entry to the United States, although upgrades are in progress. Other Indigenous nations' passports In 1977, a Cree man named Fred Plains from Timmins, Ontario, Canada, successfully entered Sweden on a home-made Cree passport.

Its approximate boundaries were to the south the mountain range of Erymanthus, to the south- east the range of Cyllene, to the east Sicyon, and to the west the Larissos river. Apart from the plain around Dyme, to the west, Achaea was generally a mountainous region. Name The name of Achaea has a slightly convoluted history. Homer uses the term Achaeans as a generic term for Greeks throughout the Iliad; conversely, a distinct region of Achaea is not mentioned. The region later known as Achaea is instead referred to as Aegialus.Homer, Iliad II, 574-575 Both Herodotus and Pausanias recount the legend that the Achaean tribe was forced out of their lands in the Argolis by the Dorians, during the legendary Dorian invasion of the Peloponnese.Herodotus VIII, 73 Consequently, the Achaeans forced the Aegialians (now known as the Ionians) out of their land.Herodotus VII, 94 The Ionians took temporary refuge in Athens, and Aegialus became known as Achaea.Pausanias VII, 1Herodotus I, 143-147 It was supposedly for this reason that the region known as Achaea in Classical Greece did not correspond to Homeric references. Under the Romans, Achaea was a province covering much of central and southern Greece. This is the Achaea referenced in the New Testament (e.g., Acts 18:12 and 19:21; Romans 15:26 and 16:5). However, Pausanias, writing in the 2nd century AD, devotes one of the books of Description of Greece to the ancient region of Achaea, showing that the name, locally at least, still preserved the use from the Classical period.Pausanias, book VII The name, Achaea, was later used in the crusader state, the Principality of Achaea (1205-1432), which comprised the whole Peloponnese, thus more closely following Roman use. The modern Greek prefecture of Achaea is largely based on the ancient region. Proto-History Dolmens and cromlechs have been found in the ancient area of Achaea dating back to the Neolithic period. Flint axes and blades fabricated from materials such as quartz or obsidian have been found in megalithic chamber tombs from this ancient region. Among other finds, alabaster pottery sherds have been discovered during excavations at Antheia in Achaia and dated to the thirteenth century CE. History Ancient Regions of Peloponnese (southern mainland Greece). Map showing the position of Achaea in Peloponnesus. Archaic and Classical Greece The twelve cities of Achaea were grouped into an early Achaean League which had important cultural and religious functions. In its later 3rd century BC incarnation the Achaean League would play an important role in Greek politics. According to Pausanias, in 688 BC the city of Hyperesia was threatened by an army from Sicyon. The locals defended their city by placing burning torches on their goats' (aiges in Greek) horns. The Sicyonians retreated and the Hyperesians renamed their town Aigeira (Greek: AŒØŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅŒ±) to honor the goats.Pausanias, Achaea 7.26.2 During the 5th century BC the cities of Achaea were neutral in the Persian Wars and were usually neutral in the struggles between Athens and Sparta. We begin to hear more of Achaea in the following centuries. In 373 BC the Achaean city of Helice was destroyed in a great cataclysm. ‚ÄúImmense columns of flame‚Äù, the first record in history of the phenomenon of earthquake lights, were seen in the days leading up to the earthquake. The quake hit at night causing Helice to subside and then a massive tsunami rushed in from the Corinthian Gulf to inundate the city. All the inhabitants perished. The city of Boura, further inland, was also destroyed in the earthquake.Pausanias, Achaea 7.24.6 In 367 BC, during Epaminondas‚Äô third invasion of the Peloponnese, the Achaean cities agreed to an alliance with Thebes. But soon when oligarchs retook the cities of Achaea they allied with Sparta against Epaminondas. At the Battle of Mantinea in 362 BC the Achaeans were allied to Sparta, Athens and Mantinea against Thebes. The Achaeans were part of the Greek alliance led by Thebes and Athens which was defeated by King Philip II of Macedon at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. Subsequently, Achaea was part of the Macedonian dominated Corinthian League. Achaean LeagueRoman period Achaea was conquered by the Romans in the year 146 BC. Emperor Augustus established Achaea as a senatorial province; generally speaking, the region benefited from the enlightened attitude of Roman emperors such as Augustus. This was because Achaea was geographically closer to Rome than other provinces, and so it was given political advantages and greater status in order for the Roman court to maintain a political equilibrium within the empire.Bunson, 1. The rule of Achaea in Roman times was placed under the Senate while a proconsul of Praetorian rank was appointed as its governor with the administrative seat in Corinth. However, Rome exercised fairly light control over Achaea: no Roman garrisons were posted there, native religious and social groups were widely tolerated by the Romans, and a general sense of free determination amongst the Greeks was commonplace. After the reign of Augustus the province of Achaea was combined with Macedonia from the years 15 until 44, coinciding with the frontier troubles. This combined imperial province was overseen by a governor placed at Moesia along the Danube River. In the year 67, Emperor Nero declared Greece to be politically free from the Roman Empire, and the Greeks began their own autonomous rule. However, Roman authority over Greece was reestablished soon after with Emperor Vespasian, who placed the province once again in the hands of the Roman Senate.

These regions are described in the works of ancient historians and geographers, and in the legends and myths of the ancient Greeks. Conceptually, there is no clear theme to the structure of these regions. Some, particularly in the Peloponnese, can be seen primarily as distinct geo-physical units, defined by physical boundaries such as mountain ranges and rivers. These regions retained their identity, even when the identity of the people living there changed during the Greek Dark Ages (or at least, was conceived by the Greeks to have changed). Conversely, the division of central Greece between Boeotia, Phocis, Doris and the three parts of Locris, cannot be understood as a logical division by physical boundaries, and instead seems to follow ancient tribal divisions. Nevertheless, these regions also survived the upheaval of the Greek Dark Ages, showing that they had acquired less political connotations. Outside the Peloponnese and central Greece, geographical divisions and identities did change over time suggesting a closer connection with tribal identity. Over time however, all the regions also acquired geo-political meanings, and political bodies uniting the cities of a region (such as the Arcadian League) became common in the Classical period. These traditional sub-divisions of Greece form the basis for the modern system of regional units of Greece. However, there are important differences, with many of the smaller ancient regions not represented in the current system. Central Greece Ancient Regions of West Central, North and West Greece. Ancient regions of Central Greece. Continental Greece ( or ) was (and still is) a geographic region of Greece. In English the area is usually called Central Greece, but the equivalent Greek term (ŒöŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±, Kentrik√≠ Ell√°da) is more rarely used. Acarnania Acarnania () is a region of west-central Greece that lies along the Ionian Sea, west of Aetolia, with the Achelous River for a boundary, and north of the gulf of Calydon, which is the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth. Today it forms the western part of the regional unit of Aetolia- Acarnania. The capital and principal city in ancient times was Stratos. The northAdages III iv 1 to IV ii 100 by Desiderius Erasmus, 2005, , p. 538, \\"Acarnania on the northern side of the Corinthian gulf was part of Epirus\\" side of Acarnania of the Corinthian Gulf was considered part of the region of Epirus. Acarnania's foundation in Greek mythology was traditionally ascribed to Acarnan, son of Alcmaeon. Aeniania Aeniania () or Ainis () was a small district to the south of Thessaly (which it was sometimes considered part of).Marcus Tullius Cicero The regions of Aeniania and Oetaea were closely linked, both occupying the valley of the Spercheios river, with Aeniania occupying the lower ground to the north, and Oetaea the higher ground south of the river. The boundaries of these two regions were formed by the arc of high ground running west from Mount Oeta round to Mount Tymphristos, then north round to the headwaters of Spercheios, and then east to the western spur of Mount Othrys. The lowland border in the Spercheios valley with Malis ran approximately north-south along from Oeta to the western spur of Othrys. During the Archaic and Classical periods, the Aenianians (in Greek Œë·º∞ŒΩŒπ·æ∂ŒΩŒµœÇ) were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and shared two votes on the Amphictyonic council with the Oetaeans. Aetolia The Achelous River separates Aetolia () from Acarnania to the west; on the north it had boundaries with Epirus and Thessaly; on the east with the Ozolian Locrians; and on the south the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf defined the limits of Aetolia. In classical times Aetolia comprised two parts: Old Aetolia in the west, from the Achelous to the Evenus and Calydon; and New Aetolia or Acquired Aetolia in the east, from the Evenus and Calydon to the Ozolian Locrians. The country has a level and fruitful coastal region, but an unproductive and mountainous interior. The mountains contained many wild beasts, and acquired fame in Greek mythology as the scene of the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. Aperantia Ancient AperantiaAperantia () was a small region of Aetolia, south of Dolopia. Attica The name of Attica () was said to be derived from Atthis, daughter of Cranaus, who was said to have been the second king of Athens. Attica is bounded on the east by the Aegean sea, on the west by Megaris and the Saronic gulf and on the north by Boeotia. It is separated from Boeotia by a range of mountains. In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Atticans were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and shared the two Ionian votes on the Amphictyonic council with the Euboeans. Boeotia The region of Boeotia (), along with many of the cities that existed there in the Classical period, is described in the \\"catalogue of ships\\", in the Iliad.Homer, Iliad II, 494-510 In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Boeotians were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and had two votes on the Amphictyonic council. Dolopia DolopiaA Latin Dictionary () was a mountainous regionAn inventory of archaic and classical poleis of Greece, located north of Aetolia. The Dolopians were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and shared two votes on the Amphictyonic council with the Perrhaeboi. Doris In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Dorians (; region: ŒîœâœÅŒØœÇ) were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and shared the two Dorian votes on the Amphictyonic council with the Laconian Dorians. Euboea In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Euboeans were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and shared the two Ionian votes on the Amphictyonic council with the Athenians. Locris The region of Locris, primarily the eastern part (\\"that dwell over against sacred Euboea\\"), is described in the Iliad.Homer, Iliad II, 527-535 In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Locrians were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and had two votes on the Amphictyonic council. Malis In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Malians were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and had two votes on the Amphictyonic council. Megaris Megaris () was a small but populous state and region of ancient Greece, west of Attica and north of Corinthia, whose inhabitants were adventurous seafarers, credited with deceitful propensities. The capital, Megara, famous for white marble and fine clay, was the birthplace of the eponymous Euclid. Mount Geraneia dominates the center of the region. Oetaea Oetaea () was a small upland district located south of Thessaly (of which it was sometimes considered part).Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) It was closely linked with the district of Aeniania, sharing a location in the valley of the Spercheios (see above). The Oetaeans were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and shared two votes on the Amphictyonic council with the Aenianes. Phocis The region of Phocis, along with some of the cities that existed there in the Classical period, is described in the Iliad.Homer, Iliad II, 517-526 In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Phocians were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and had two votes on the Amphictyonic council, until they were stripped of them after the Third Sacred War. Peloponnese Ancient Regions of Peloponnese (southern mainland Greece). The Peloponnese or Peloponnesos, is a large peninsula at the southern tip of the Balkans, and part of the traditional heartland of Greece. It is joined to the Greek 'mainland' by the Isthmus of Corinth. The Peloponnese is conventionally divided into seven regions, which remain in use as regional units of modern Greece. Most of these regions are directly named in the \\"catalogue of ships\\" in the Iliad,Homer, Iliad II, 459-779 suggesting that this geographic division of the Peloponnese is very ancient, and stretches back to Mycenaean Greece. Achaea Geographically, Achaea was (and is) the northernmost region of the Peloponnese, occupying the coastal strip north of Arcardia. To the south, it bordered Arcadia along the ridge of high ground running from Mount Erymanthos to Mount Cyllene. To the east, it bordered Corinthia near to the city of Sicyon, and to the west the Larissos river and western ridge of Erymanthos formed the border with Elis. Apart from the plain around Dyme, to the west, Achaea was generally a mountainous region. Arcadia Geographically, ancient Arcadia occupied the highlands at the centre of the Peloponnese. To the north, it bordered Achaea along the ridge of high ground running from Mount Erymanthos to Mount Cyllene; most of Mount Aroania lay within Arcadia. To the east, it had borders with Argolis and Corinthia along the ridge of high ground running from Mount Cyllene round to Mount Oligyrtus and then south Mount Parthenius. To the south, the border Laconia and Messenia ran through the foothills of the Parnon and Taygetos mountain ranges, such that Arcadia contained all the headwaters of the Alpheios river, but none of the Eurotas river. To the south-west, the border with Messania ran along the tops of Mount Nomia, and Mount Elaeum, and from there the border with Elis ran along the valleys of the Erymanthos and Diagon rivers. Most of the region of Arcardia was mountainous, apart from the plains around Tegea and Megalopolis, and the valleys of the Alpheios and Ladon rivers. Due to its remote, mountainous character, Arcadia seems to have been a cultural refuge. When, during the Greek Dark Age, Doric Greek dialects were introduced to the Peloponnese, the older language apparently survived in Arcadia, and formed part of the Arcado-Cypriot group of Greek languages. Herodotus says that the inhabitants of Arcadia were Pelasgians, the Greek name for the supposed 'indigenous' inhabitants of Greece, who dwelt there before the arrival of the 'Hellenic' tribes.Herodotus I, 56-57 Whilst Herodotus seems to have found the idea that the Pelasgians were not 'Greek' far-fetched, it is clear that the Arcadians were considered as the original inhabitants of the region.Herodotus VIII, 73 Arcadia is one of the regions described in the \\"catalogue of ships\\" in the Iliad.Homer, Iliad II, 603-611 Agamemnon himself gave Arcadia the ships for the Trojan war because Arcadia did not have a navy. There is a modern regional unit of Greece of the same name, which is more extensive than the ancient region. Argolis Ancient Argolis (sometimes called 'the Argolid') occupied the eastern part of the Peloponnesus, primarily the Argolid peninsula, together with the coastal region to the east of Arcadia, and north of Laconia. To the north, the boundary with the territory of Corinth was rather more fluid, and these territories have sometimes been considered together. For instance, Pausanias discussed Argolis and Corinthia together in one book of his Description of Greece;Pausanias, Book II similarly, in modern Greece, a prefecture of \\"Argolidocorinthia\\" has existed at various times. Argolis took its name from the principal city of the region during the Archaic and Classical periods, Argos. Argolis is discussed in the \\"catalogue of ships\\" of the Iliad, without being given that explicit name, but the major cities of the region are listed together under the leadership of Diomedes.Homer, Iliad II, 559-568 There is a modern regional unit of Greece of the same name, occupying a smaller area than the ancient region. Corinthia The territory associated with the city of ancient Corinth in ancient Greece lay on either side of the isthmus of Corinth. On the northern side of the Isthmus, it was bounded by Mount Geraneia, which separated it from Megaris. On the Peloponnesian side of the Isthmus, Corinthia was bounded by Achaea to the west, and to the south by the territory of Argolis. As discussed above, the boundary between Argolis and Corinthia was rather fluid, and in both ancient and modern times, the regions have been considered together. Corinthia is discussed in the \\"catalogue of ships\\" of the Iliad, without being given that explicit name, but the major cities of the region are listed together under the leadership of Agamemnon.Homer, Iliad II, 570-573 There is a modern regional unit of Greece of the same name. Elis Elis occupied the western, and flattest part of the Peloponnese. To the north-east, it bordered Achaea along the Larissos river and western spur of Erymanthos, and the east the border with Arcadia ran along the Erymanthos and Diagon rivers to Mount Elaeum. From the Elaeum, its border with Messenia ran along the Neda (river) river to the sea. Elis is discussed in the \\"catalogue of ships\\" of the Iliad, without being given that explicit name (Elis is only used for the name of the city), but the major cities of the region are listed together.Homer, Iliad II, 615-624 There is a modern regional unit of Greece with the same name. Laconia Laconia (also called Lacedaemon; , Lakedaim≈çn), occupied the south-eastern part of the Peloponnese. Its principal boundaries were formed by the Parnon and Taygetos mountain ranges. Its western boundary, adjoining Messenia, ran along the Koskaraka river from just south of the city of Abia, up into the Taygetos range, and then north along the Taygetos ridge. The northern border with Arcadia ran amongst the foothills of Taygetos and Parnon, such that up Laconia included all the headwaters of the Eurotas river. To the north-east of the Parnon range was the coastal area of Cynuria; this was originally part of the Argolid, but by the Classical period had become part of Laconia. The land between the Taygetos and Parnon ranges formed the heart of Laconia; the coastal region east of Parnon, and south of Cynuria was also part of Laconia. Lacedaemon is one of the regions described in the \\"catalogue of ships\\" in the Iliad.Homer, Iliad II, 581-590 In the Archaic and Classical periods, the Laconians were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and shared the two Dorian votes on the Amphictyonic council with the Dorians from Doris. There is a modern regional unit of Greece of the same name. During the Classical period, Laconia was dominated by the city of Sparta. There were other settlements in the region, and most inhabitants were not full Spartan citizens (Spartiates), but Lacedaemonians or Perioeci (\\"about-dwellers\\"). However, all these citizens and towns were part of the Spartan state. Only after the final eclipse of Spartan power after the War against Nabis did the rest of Laconia become free from Spartan domination. However, Laconia instead fell under the domination of the Achaean League until the whole of the Peloponnese was conquered by the Romans in 146 BC. Messenia Messenia occupied the south-western part of the Peloponnese. To the north it had a border with Elis along the Neda river, from whence the border with Arcadia ran along the tops of Mount Elaeum and Mount Nomia. The northern border with Arcadia then ran amongst the foothills of Taygetos, but all the headwater of the Alpheios river lay outside Messenia. The eastern border with Laconia ran along the Taygetos ridge up to the Koskaraka river, and then along that river to the sea, near the city of Abia. There is a modern regional unit of Greece of the same name. Thessalia Ancient Regions West Central, North and West Greece. Thessaly or Thessalia was one of the traditional regions of Ancient Greece. During the Mycenaean period, Thessaly was known as Aeolia, a name that continued to be used for one of the major tribes of Greece, the Aeolians, and their dialect of Greek, Aeolic. Achaea Phthiotis The Phtiotic Achaeans were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and had two votes on the Amphictyonic council. Magnesia The Magnetes were members of the Delphian Amphictyonic League, and had two votes on the Amphictyonic council.

Their organs remain in use (with restoration work) at the Isaac M. Wise Temple (formerly Plum Street Temple) and other locations. Much of Matthias Schwab's personal life remains a mystery. He arrived in Cincinnati in 1831 and in 1860 he apparently relinquished ownership of his factory at Sycamore and Schiller to Johann Heinrich Koehnken who was assisted by Gallus Grimm. Koehnken was born on a farm in Altenbuhlstedt in the Lower Saxony area of Germany (not far from Bremen) and was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. He worked as a cabinet maker for two years in Germany and two more in Wheeling before coming to Cincinnati in 1839. He \\"found his way to the door of Matthias Schwab\\", who had trained as an organ builder in Germany and operated a \\"highly regarded organ works in the fast-growing river town of Cincinnati.\\" When Schwab retired in 1860, Koehnken and Grimm, a German- trained organ builder, continued the tradition and the firm became Koehnken and Company. Grimm partnered with Koehnken from 1875 and the firm became Koehnken & Grimm.Orpha Caroline Ochse The History of the Organ in the United States page 296 They worked together for twenty-one years until Koehnken retired in 1896.

He had two sisters, Arleene Annie and Ida Eveline. First World War Redgate entered the Royal Navy on 3 January 1917 as probationary flight officer for temporary service in the Royal Naval Air Service. After initial flight training he was granted Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 4579 after soloing a Caudron biplane at the Royal Naval Air Station at Redcar, Yorkshire, on 30 March. He was promoted to flight sub-lieutenant on 13 June, and posted to No. 9 (Naval) Squadron in northern France to fly the Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter. Redgate scored his first victory there on 25 July 1917, driving a German reconnaissance aircraft down out of control off Westende. Redgate then had to wait until 5 September before gaining his second victory. Two more followed that month, and three in October. On 13 December 1917 he was promoted to flight lieutenant, by which time his had gained two more victories, taking his total to nine. Redgate scored only once more, on 3 February 1918, during the next three months. On 1 April 1918, the British Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force. The next day Redgate drove down an Albatros D.III south of Halluin, and scored three more times that month, and twice in May. On the last of these, on 15 May 1918, he sustained a leg wound serious enough to remove him from combat for the rest of the war. His final tally was nine enemy aircraft destroyed, including six shared with other pilots, and seven enemy aircraft driven down out of control, including three shared. He thereafter served in the Home Establishment until after the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

Built in 1908, it is one of the few wooden synagogues in continued usage in the southeastern United States. History Though the number of Jews remained sporadic and sparse until the 1880s, Jews always fared well in the small coastal town of Beaufort, South Carolina. With the mass immigration of Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews to Beaufort beginning in the 1880s, the Jewish population of the town grew to well over 30 families and soon prompted the need for a formal congregation. While the Jewish community in Beaufort predates the American Revolutionary War, its residents prayed informally in a number of locations before obtaining space in the town's Masonic Hall and in the Beaufort Arsenal. Granted a state charter in 1905, the congregation was formed to purchase the land near the arsenal that became the site for their synagogue on Scott Street. A number of members participated in the construction of the building, which was dedicated in ceremonies held on June 14, 1908, which were led by Rabbi George Solomon of Savannah, Georgia.History of Temple Beth Israel, Beaufort, SC , Jewish Historical Society of South Carolina.

After attending school to the age of 15, he married at age 22 a woman two decades his senior, Maren Nielsdatter, the widow of the merchant Segud Langwagen . Using her capital, Severin took over her former husband's monopoly over the Icelandic trade with Denmark and built a thriving company specialized on Iceland, Finnmark and whaling off Spitzbergen. As a member of Copenhagen's 32 Men, he had the right of an audience before the king. The failure of the Bergen Greenland Company (Det Bergen Gr√∏nlandske Compagnie) operated by Hans Egede and of the royal colony in Greenland established by Claus Paarss allowed Severin to convince the new King Christian VI and his council to grant his company a full monopoly over trade with the Greenland settlements, a right King Frederick IV had previously withheld for fear of antagonizing merchants of the Dutch Republic.Marquardt, Ole. \\"Change and Continuity in Denmark's Greenland Policy\\" in The Oldenburg Monarchy: An Underestimated Empire?. Verlag Ludwig (Kiel), 2006. The Greenland monopoly ran from 1733 and was renewed in 1740. Severin received the right to fly the Danebrog in 1738 and successfully repulsed the Dutch in 1738 and 1739, seizing four of their ships while losing only one of his own. His company was originally underwritten with an annual subsidy of 2000 rixdollars, but this was increased after he petitioned the king in 1740 and claimed to have already lost 16,000 rixdollars on the trade owing to the smallpox epidemic which had decimated the island between 1733 and 1735.Grove, G.L. \\"Sewerin Sewerin, Jacob, 1691-1753, Handelsmand\\". Jacobshavn (modern Ilulissat) was named for him, and Poul Egede called him his dearest friend. Severin married the second time in 1735 to Birgitte Sophie Nygaard of Resen (1704-1739). The same year he purchased Dronninglund Castle from diplomat Carl Adolph von Pless (1747-1810). The estate included a forest subsequently used to equip his ships. A third marriage in 1742 to his niece Mary Dalager required a royal license. In 1749, Severin returned the monopoly, which the king then bestowed on the General Trade Company. Severin then focused his business on trade with Norway. Owing to his friendship with the missionary Paul Egede, however, Severin remained connected to the Greenland mission work throughout his life. Jacob Severin was one of the most respected, influential and wealthy merchants of Copenhagen. He died on 21 March 1753 at Dronninglund Castle, his estate valued at 9,000 rixdollars, and was buried at Dronninglund Church (Dronninglund Kirke).

Electrical engineering  In electrical engineering, utilization factor, k_\\\\text{u} , is the ratio of the maximum load which could be drawn to the rated capacity of the system. This is closely related to the concept of Load factor. The Load factor is the ratio of the load that a piece of equipment actually draws (time averaged) when it is in operation to the load it could draw (which we call full load). For example, an oversized motor - 15 kW - drives a constant 12 kW load whenever it is on. The motor load factor is then 12/15 = 80%. The motor above may only be used for eight hours a day, 50 weeks a year. The hours of operation would then be 2800 hours, and the motor use factor for a base of 8760 hours per year would be 2800/8760 = 31.96%. With a base of 2800 hours per year, the motor use factor would be 100%.

However, the proposal met obstacles and was referred to the Supreme Court of India. It defines river water sharing between the states of Punjab and Haryana. Captain Abhimanyu, Finance Minister of Haryana, while presenting the Government of Haryana 2018-19 budget in March 2018 announced that INR 100 crore (1 billion) funds had been allocated for completion of the construction of SYL.haryana budgest 2018-19, Times of India, 9 March 2018.  History  After the partition of India in 1947 into Pakistan and India, the Indus basin was bisected with India gaining the upper reaches of the Indus river and its tributaries while Pakistan gained the lower reaches. This led to a situation in which utilisation and development of water resources in one country would hamper the same in another. While negotiations for resolving the dispute were in progress in 1954, activities had already started in India in anticipation of a treaty. Although the issue of water of Sutlej river was resolved through the Bhakra Nangal project, the issue of surplus waters of Ravi river and Beas river excluding the pre-Partition use remained. On 29 January 1955, the states of Punjab, PEPSU, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir came to an agreement regarding the distribution of water from the rivers, with Punjab being allocated 5.9 MAF (million acre-feet) and PEPSU gaining 1.3 MAF out of the estimated 15.85 MAF of water while Rajasthan gained 8 MAF and Jammu and Kashmir gaining the remaining 0.65 MAF. With the merger of Punjab and PEPSU in 1956, the total share of Punjab became 7.2 MAF. The Indus Water Treaty reached in 1960 allowed India unrestricted use of water from Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. The dispute regarding sharing of river water emerged after Punjab was reorganised in 1966, and the state of Haryana was created. Haryana demanded 4.8 MAF out of Punjab's total 7.2 MAF share of water from the rivers, while Punjab claimed the entire quantity belonged to it. Haryana asked the Union government to intervene as no agreement could be reached. In 1976, when the country was under an internal emergency, an executive order was issued by the Union government which allocated 3.5 MAF of water to both states while Delhi received the remaining 0.2 MAF. In order to make full use of the allocated water, a Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal was proposed. The decision was met with opposition in Punjab by Shromani Akali Dal. After coming to power in 1977, the Shiromani Akali Dal demanded that the water sharing between Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan be adjudicated by Supreme Court and filed a suit against the order of the Union government. The construction of canal was started in the same year by the Akali Dal government under Chief Minister of Punjab Prakash Singh Badal. The Haryana government led by Chaudhary Devi Lal provided Rs. 10,000,000 to the Punjab government for this purpose. The government later issued a notification to acquire land for the SYL canal. The construction of the canal's portion in Haryana was completed by June 1980. After the Indian National Congress came to power in Punjab in 1980, an agreement was reached on 31 December 1981 between Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, which were all under INC rule, with Darbara Singh being the Chief Minister of Punjab and Indira Gandhi being the Prime Minister of India. Under the agreement, Punjab's share was increased to 4.22 MAF and that of Rajasthan to 8.6 MAF while the share of Haryana from the revised 17.17 MAF of water remained the same. All states withdrew their suits from the Supreme Court following the signing of agreement. On 8 April 1982, Indira Gandhi formally launched the construction of the canal at Kapoori village of Punjab in 1982. On 23 April, the Punjab government issued a white paper hailing the agreement. Per the terms reached under Punjab accord, a tribunal was to be set up to investigate the river water claims of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. The Akali Dal came back to power in Punjab in October 1985 and on 5 November 1985, the newly elected Punjab Legislative Assembly repudiated the 1981 agreement. The Ravi and Beas Waters Tribunal (also known as Eradi Tribunal after its chair V. Balakrishna Eradi) was constituted on 2 April 1986. On 30 January 1987, the tribunal upheld the legality of the agreements of 1955, 1976 and 1981. It also increased shares of both Punjab and Haryana, allocating them 5 MAF and 3.83 MAF respectively. It also noted that while the canal's portion had been completed in Haryana, the portion in Punjab wasn't and urged that it be completed expeditiously. The Akali Dal government in Punjab under Surjit Singh Barnala started the construction of the canal. However, it kept dithering on its completion. The construction was stopped in July 1990 after a Chief Engineer associated with its construction was shot dead by militants. The canal remained uncompleted due to dispute over the issue. In 1999, Haryana filed a suit in the Supreme Court seeking construction of the canal. In 2002, the Supreme Court directed Punjab to complete the SYL canal within a year. Punjab refused to do so and petitioned for a review of the court order which was rejected. In 2004, the Supreme Court directed the Union government to get the canal completed through a central agency. The Central Public Works Department was appointed on 2 July 2004 to take over the canal work from Punjab government. However, on 12 July 2004, the Punjab Legislative Assembly passed the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004 which abrogated all its river water agreements with neighbouring states. The President of India then referred this bill to the Supreme Court in the same year. The court began hearings on the bill by the Punjab Assembly on 7 March 2016. On 15 March 2016, the Punjab Legislative Assembly unanimously passed the Punjab Satluj Yamuna Link Canal Land (Transfer of Proprietary Rights) Bill, 2016, proposing to return the land that had been taken from owners for building the SYL canal. On 18 March, the Supreme Court ordered the Punjab government to maintain status quo on the land meant for construction of the canal. On 10 November, the court gave its opinion that Punjab government's 2004 bill which terminated river water agreements was illegal. On 15 November, the government passed an executive order, denotifying the land meant for the digging of the canal and returned it to its original owners through notification issued by Punjab's financial commissioner of revenue K.B.S. Sidhu, utilising revenue powers that rests with an IAS officer. Punjab's Legislative Assembly also passed a resolution on the next day, demanding royalties for river water supplied to its non-riparian neighbors Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi. All of the denotified land was returned by 20 November. A status quo was however again ordered by the Supreme Court relating to the land on 30 November. On 22 February 2017, the Supreme Court stated that the Government of Punjab will have to abide by its order on construction of SYL canal and will pass a decree if the governments of Punjab and Haryana failed to come to an agreement.  Status of the project  The canal is 85% complete with Haryana government completing its part of the canal. It has completed 92 km of canal in its land. Haryana would benefit enormously by gaining water from Ravi-Beas from Punjab. On 30 November 2016, the Supreme Court appointed the Union Home Secretary, Punjab's Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police as receivers for submitting a report on the present status of land and other properties on the canal site by 15 December. The receivers submitted their reports as per schedule, stating in the reports that there was no fresh or deliberate damage to the canal. To augment nearly 100 tmcft water availability for the needs of this link canal, Lingdi Nadi (a tributary of Tso Moriri lake) waters can be diverted to the Sutlej basin by digging a 9 km long gravity canal to connect to the Ungti Chu river. Ungti Chu river, is a tributary of Sutlej river with its drainage area located in Jammu and Kashmir state. Thus water need not be spared by Punjab state for the needs of this canal. Protests The Shiromani Akali Dal held a protest over the SYL issue on 12 April 2016 in Ludhiana, whilst accusing national convenor of Aam Aadmi Party and Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal and his government of \\"double-speak\\" and \\"anti-Punjab stand\\". On 11 November 2016, all Indian National Congress MLAs of the Punjab Legislative Assembly resigned in protest at the Supreme Court's decision that the state's termination of the link canal was unconstitutional. Aam Aadmi Party began an indefinite protest on the same day at Kapoori village, blaming both the Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress for SYL. Apprehending law and order problem over the issue, the Punjab Police deployed the Rapid Action Force in parts of Punjab, sealed the border with Haryana and increased patrolling on the National Highway-1 on 12 November. A Congress rally was organised on 13 November at Khuian Sarwar village. President of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee Amarinder Singh declared that not a single drop a water will go out of Punjab while also announcing that a Congress delegation including MPs and MLAs would meet President of India Pranab Mukherjee on the issue. The delegation met the President on 17 November, urging him to form a panel to look into the SYL issue and direct the Union government to consider ground realities and water availability in the state before taking any action on advice of the Supreme Court. Amarinder resigned from Lok Sabha on 23 November in protest against the issue. A delegation of Punjab government's ministers met the President on 28 November, urging him not to accept any advice against the riparian water rights. The Akali Dal held a rally at Moga on 8 December regarding the issue. Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal stated that the controversy had been resolved after hiving back the land meant for the canal to the original owners. He also stated that Punjab didn't have a single drop of water to spare. In January 2017, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) announced that it will dig the canal itself on 23 February. In response, Punjab's government heightened security along the Punjab-Haryana border. On 23 February, INLD along with its supporters entered Punjab to start the digging of the canal. More than 70 of its leaders were arrested by the Punjab Police for violating prohibitory orders. Haryana claims that it is riparian state of Sutlej river as the upper reaches of Sirsa Nadi which is a tributary of Sutlej river is draining north western area of Haryana state. Rajasthan claims that it is also riparian state of Sutlej river as its northern area is part of the river basin. Irrigation experts believe that Rajasthan will lose significant chunk of its share as the Feeder canals from Harike Pattan will lose water volume due to SYL.

Great-uncle of Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro y Andrade, Conde de Lemos. He was closely linked to the city of Monforte de Lemos in Galicia, where he was the founder of the College of Our Lady of Antigua. Travels and studies Popularly known as \\"Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro'\\", was a renaissance man, considered by many authors as the last great ecclesiastical prince. His birthplace is disputed, with some authors arguing that he was born in Valladolid in 1523. He studied canon law at Salamanca, where his brother, Pedro de Castro Lemos, who later became bishop of Cuenca (1553‚Äì1561), was named cardinal on 15 December 1583, by Gregory XIII.

The cardinal was widely criticized for his taste for pomp and magnificence. He held expensive hunting parties, and large numbers of attendants and servants, besides the taste for luxury and art. He felt a great fondness for falconry, which is recorded by the \\"Treaty hunting Bird\\" by Pero L√≥pez de Ayala, which is preserved at the Museum of Our Lady of Antigua, which belonged to his personal collection. Criticism also arose over the Archbishop of Seville to surround himself exclusively with servants and associates from Galicia. His other traits were his generosity and humanism, creating a home for girls in difficult circumstances, struggling for humanization of treatment in prisons and aid to impoverished clergy aid for construction and improvement of temples, hospitals and hospices, as well as exercise patron of the arts.  College of Our Lady of Antigua and death of Cardinal  During convalescence from a serious illness, during 1592, Rodrigo decided to start the monumental work of the College of Our Lady of Antigua.

The Lombok Strait is part of the Wallace Line, a major biogeographic boundary separating the Indomalayan and Australasian biogeographic realms. The ecoregion is part of Wallacea, a group of islands that are part of the Australasian realm, but were never joined to either the Australian or Asian continents. The islands of Wallacea are home to a mix of plants and animals from both terrestrial realms, and have many unique species that evolved in isolation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. The Ombai Strait lies at the eastern end of the ecoregion, separating Alor from the large island of Timor to the southeast. Although both Timor and Sumba, which lies to the south, are also considered part of the Lesser Sunda Islands, they constitute separate ecoregions. Flores is the largest of the islands at 13,540 km¬≤. The islands are mostly mountainous, and Mount Rinjani on Lombok is the highest point at 3,726 meters elevation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Climate The ecoregion has a tropical monsoon climate. The islands are the driest in Indonesia, with rainfall averaging 1,350 mm annually. Rainfall is strongly seasonal, falling mostly during the December-to-March rainy season. The driest months are June through September. Flora The main plant communities are monsoon forests and savannas. There are several distinct types of monsoon forest which vary with on rainfall and elevation. They include moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forest, dry thorn forest, and dry evergreen forest. Evergreen montane forests grow above 1200 meters elevation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment.

The ecoregion has 50 species of mammals, including six endemic species: the Flores shrew (Suncus mertensi), Lombok flying fox (Pteropus lombocensis), Sunda long-eared bat (Nyctophilus heran), Flores long- nosed rat (Paulamys naso), Flores giant rat (Papagomys armandvillei), and Komodo rat (Komodomys rintjanus). Humans long ago introduced the Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), a deer originating in Java and Bali, to Flores and several other islands. The banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus) was also brought to Sumbawa, Komodo, Flores, and other islands from Sundaland. It is a source of food for both humans and Komodo dragons.

He scored those victories over a two-year span, beginning on 17 November 1916 and ending on 4 November 1918.The Aerodrome website page on Seitz Retrieved on 16 September 2020. Aerial service Seitz was already a Vizefeldwebel when he joined Jagdstaffel 8 on 10 November 1916. He scored his first aerial victory on 17 November. He would account for three more opponents during 1917, and had run his total to ten by the time he transferred out of the squadron. In September 1918, he was appointed to command Jagdstaffel 68. As Vizefeldwebel is not a command rank, it can be inferred that Seitz had previously been commissioned as Leutnant. Leading his new unit by example, Seitz shot down six more enemy airplanes by the Armistice. He ended the war credited with 16 aerial victories.

After its confluence with the Marico River, both rivers form the Limpopo River.Major rivers and streams within the Limpopo River Basin Course NASA picture of the Crocodile River south of Thabazimbi The Crocodile River has its source in the Witwatersrand mountain range, originating in Constantia Kloof, Roodepoort, Gauteng province. The first dam it fills is the Lake Heritage Dam just west of the Lanseria Airport. Just north of this airport is its confluence with the Jukskei River. Further downstream into the North West two large dams are located in the river, namely Hartbeespoort DamHartbeespoort Dam History and Roodekoppies Dam. Beyond the Hartbeespoort Dam, it passes the town of Brits. The Elands River joins downstream from the Vaalkop Dam, about 20 km further the Pienaars River joins its right bank, shortly after exiting the Klipvoor Dam. In the Limpopo Province, about 35 km further, the Crocodile River passes the town of Thabazimbi and meanders for many miles through a sparsely inhabited area before joining the Marico River just west of Rooibokkraal at the limit of North West Province to form the start of the Limpopo River.Mokolo and Crocodile River (West) Tributaries The tributaries of the Crocodile River include the Bloubankspruit, Hennops River, Jukskei River, Magalies River, Sterkstroom River, Rosespruit, Skeerpoort River, Kareespruit, Elands River, Bierspruit River and Sundays River.Crocodile/Marico WMA 3 Pollution Massive growth of water hyacinth deteriorating the water quality of Hartbeespoort Dam The Crocodile River is one of the most pressured river systems in South Africa. The effects of pollution from two of South Africa's metropolitan areas, Johannesburg and Tshwane, has been detrimental to the ecology of the system. Untreated industrial, mining, agricultural and household waste has deteriorated the water quality throughout most of its course and led to massive algal blooms in the Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodekoppies Dam. Invasive plant species have negatively affected the integrity of the system. Unsustainable farming practices have led to sediment overloads and erosion further harming the river.

Built in the Herreriano style, the school is often known as El Escorial of Galicia, being of the few manifestations of this style in this community. It is forever linked to the figure of its founder, Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro, perhaps the last great ecclesiastical prince of the Renaissance in Spain, Archbishop of Seville, great benefactor of Monforte, and patron of the arts. The college was a Seminary until 1773 and later a University, displaying up to seven chairs in a time when it was not yet established in the province. Originally run by the Jesuits, their order was expelled from Spain, through the Pragmatic Sanction of 1767 led to the elimination of any existing symbol to remember their existence in the country. Heritage Rodrigo de Castro, praying statue, by John of Bologna The church has an altar of wood carved by Francisco de Moure which could not be completed in his life and was completed by his son. On one side of the altar it is possible to observe a statue of Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro praying. This was created by John of Bologna and is highly regarded for its perfection and uniqueness. The statue, located above the remains of Cardinal, is confronted with a picture of Our Lady of Antigua. Behind the painting was another tomb which various studies revealed was for the mother of the Cardinal. The school has two cloisters, and appears to be incomplete in its west wing. The monumental staircase, built from 1594 to 1603, is located in the east wing; its design is built on three arches, without apparent support, that support thirteen, nine thirteen steps each. The ladder is held because of a carefully calculated play of forces. The steps are carved from a single piece of high-quality granite. On the ground, drawing of the projection of the staircase can be seen, drawn for its construction. Francis of Assisi, the work of El Greco.An art gallery is also located there highlighting several works by El Greco. Foremost among these is a masterly painting of Francis of Assisi holding a skull. According to critics and experts, it is a work of such high quality that it matches or even exceeds that of the known works of the artist, constituting one of his crowning achievements. His San Lorenzo (Lawrence of Rome) is also a very popular work, being one of the few devotional paintings done by the painter on his arrival in Toledo, where it was purchased by Rodrigo de Castro during his time in the Inquisition. Other works in the gallery include five works of the Mannerist painter Andrea del Sarto, \\"St. Margaret of Cortona\\", \\"St. Agnes\\", \\"St. Catherine of Alexandria\\", \\"San Pedro\\" and \\"San Juan Bautista\\". The painting \\"The Adoration of the Magi\\" by Van der Goes is only a copy, since the original was sold in 1913 to Staatliche Museen in Berlin for one million two hundred thousand pesetas allowing completion of the works of the school. The gallery is complete with two works by the School of Compostela, \\"Death\\" and \\"Doomsday\\", and an anonymous portrait of Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro. The museum also has several incunabula and manuscripts, among them an incomplete copy of \\"Libro de la Caza de las Aves\\" (\\"Book of Bird Hunting\\"), a treatise on falconry by Pedro L√≥pez de Ayala which he authored during his captivity in Portugal, as well as personal belongings of the cardinal.

The company was formed March 1844 to operate a new line using the atmospheric principle. However, before its line was opened it was amalgamated with other companies to form the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) on 27 July 1846. History=Plans The early success of the London and Croydon Railway (LCR), encouraged its directors to form a new independent company to continue the line to Epsom. This was approved by shareholders at a Meeting 7 March 1844. The railway was then experimenting in the use of atmospheric propulsion and decided to use the Samuel Clegg and Jacob and Joseph Samuda system patented in 1838. p.243-8. However, difficulties in acquiring suitable land meant that the line was not completed in 1846 as originally planned.Turner, (1977), p.267.
