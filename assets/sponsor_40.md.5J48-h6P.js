History=Establishment A.W. Bash, of Seattle, was sent to China in the spring of 1896 as an agent for the American China Development Company, arriving with letters of recommendation from the State Department. Bash also represented a group of American businessmen who aimed to build a railway line that would cross China from north to south. By November 1896, Bash and the director general of the Chinese Railway Bureau, Sheng Hsuan-huai, had reached an initial agreement for the construction of a railway line from the Marco Polo Bridge over the Yongding near Beijing (then romanized as \\"Peking\\") to Hankou (\\"Hankow\\") in the south on the Yangtze. However, a formal agreement was not reached and Charles Denby, charge d‚Äôaffaires for the American China Development Company, urged the imperial authorities to instruct Sheng to quickly agree to a contract. This resulted in the Chinese giving the concession to a Belgian group that was funded by Paris financiers and the Russo-Chinese Bank. Canton‚ÄìHankow Railway The American China Development Company then pursued the right to build the southern leg, from Wuchang across the river from Hankou to Guangzhou (\\"Canton\\") on the Pearl River. America, unlike the Russian, French, German, Japanese, or British empires, did not have a political stake in the Chinese economy and had significant experience building railroads, which made the American China Development Company an attractive option. In April 1898, the Chinese minister in Washington and A.W. Bash came to an agreement for a loan in which the American company had to market bonds worth 4,000,000, to oversee the construction of the railroad, and to operate it during the fifty years of the loan period. The concession also allowed the company to operate coal mines nearby. The Guangzhou‚ÄìWuchang line was the only railway project secured by an American company after 1895, but even this railway line would be lost within seven years. The project faced uncertainty, given the interest of other powers‚Äîparticularly France and Britain‚Äîin China. As a result, the American China Development Company agreed to share half of their concession for the line with the British and Chinese Corporation in February 1899. A New York engineer, William Barclay Parsons, was sent by the American China Development Company to survey the proposed route during the winter of 1898-1899. After evaluating the costs of the railroad, the company determined that their current loan agreement with China would only fund about half of the costs of the railroad construction. The company reached a supplementary agreement with the Chinese Minister in July 1900, which provided the American China Development Company $40, 000, 000 gold bonds from the Chinese government.‚ÄúCanton-Hankow Railway,‚Äù The New York Times, July 14, 1902 However, the supplemental agreement reached between the American China Development Company and the Chinese government made no mention of the earlier affiliation between the American China Development Company and the British and Chinese Corporation. International competition concerning development interests in China continued to be an issue. In December 1901, the American China Development Company was reorganized, which resulted in the Company taking on two Belgian directors, Senator de Volder of Brussels and Pierre Mali, the Belgian consul in New York. The reorganization also meant that the company became more financially dependent on Belgium, as one of the three banks that now backed the Company was the Banque d‚ÄôOutremer of Brussels. By late 1903, the Belgians were striving to divide the line in order to gain sole of control of the northern portion. In January 1904, Sheng claimed that the Belgians had gained control of the company. When the American China Development Company first reached their agreement with the Chinese government, they had agreed to remain an American-owned and controlled company, and were not allowed, under the terms of the contract, to sell out to another nation. Many Chinese officials were concerned about the effect of giving concessions to foreign companies, especially those with a political interest in China, like Belgium or France. When Belgian influence increased within the American China Development Company in late 1903 to early 1904, the governors and the members of the upper class of Hunan and Hubei pushed for the cancellation of the American China Development Company‚Äôs concession to prevent the Belgians from controlling the railway line. In response to the threat of losing their concession, the company asked that the State Department help the American China Development Company regain the majority of the shares of stocks in the spring of 1904. While the United States government was initially supportive of the interests of the American company, as the dispute intensified, the State Department refused to become further involved in the conflict. The branch line to Foshan (\\"Fatshan\\") and Sanshui (\\"Samshui\\") was completed between 1902 and 1904. Dissolution In October 1904, work on the railway line had come to a stop. A month later, in November 1904, the imperial government formally notified the charge d‚Äôaffaires of the American China Development Company of the Chinese government‚Äôs intention to cancel the concession. Despite American political pressure on the Chinese foreign office, the throne allowed Viceroy Zhang Zhidong to officially revoke the concession in December, 1904. After the loss of the concession for the line, the Belgian king Leopold allowed the Americans to buy back company stock in January 1905. J.P. Morgan bought 1200 shares, making him the new controlling interest in the company. Between January and June 1905, the American China Development Company worked to come to a settlement with the Chinese government for the loss of the concession. Ultimately on June 7, 1905, the American China Development Company and the Chinese came to an agreement: China would pay $675,000 in recompense to cover the properties and bonds sold by the company. In August 1905, the stockholders of the company voted to accept June agreement. Company Timeline 1895- Company incorporated in NJ 1896- A.W.

Events  On the night of 7 March 1932, Swedish politician Hjalmar von Sydow, his cook Karoline Herou, and his maid Ebba Hamn were all found beaten to death at Sydow's town house at Norr M√§larstrand in Stockholm. The bodies of Sydow and Herou were found in Herou's room; Hamn lay dead in Sydow's room. From the outset, it was presumed the murder weapon was an iron pipe, bought the day before the murders by Sydow's son, Fredrik von Sydow, but it was later determined that a flatiron, missing after the murders, was the real murder weapon. A young niece of Sydow's late wife, who also lived at the home, discovered the bodies. Her account led the police to issue a warrant for the arrest of Fredrik von Sydow and his wife Ingun as the main suspects in the case. Immediately after the murders, the pair had travelled by taxi to meet competitive shooter Sven O. Hallman, a friend of Fredrik's, borrowing a gun from him. Afterwards, the pair went to the Tegner restaurant in Stockholm, then visited a men's clothing store, a pharmacy, yet another restaurant called Vallonen, and the Gillet restaurant in Uppsala, where they arrived at about 8pm. They had arranged to have dinner with friends, and while the dinner was in progress, Fredrik shot his wife and then shot himself in the head.  Motive  The motive for the murders remains unclear, but one possible scenario is that Fredrik was a drug user and had fallen into serious financial difficulties. Fredrik's relationship with his father was strained. These factors might have resulted in a desperate impulse to murder. According to the police, Fredrik had taken his father's wallet, which contained SEK 235 (equivalent to SEK 7000 today) at the time of the murders.

To use these letters, a member did not have to pass an examination or achieve anything in the disciplines of science or art.

Criticism of the Society Sir Henry Trueman Wood, critic of the Society On 23 February 1883, Sir Henry Trueman Wood, Secretary of the Royal Society of Arts, sent a letter to The Times, complaining that the SSLA was using a title too much like its own, and that it had been asking the RSA's members to sign up to the Society of Science, Letters and Art while giving the impression that the RSA had commissioned this request. It added that some of its members had paid to join the SSLA, and when they realised their mistake and asked for a refund, no refund was forthcoming. In October 1886, the Society received strong criticism from New Zealand. The complaint was that \\"the society's favours (i.e. the offering of scientific fellowships) appear to be sown broadcast.\\" The complaint was prompted by the following note, sent speculatively from London to likely candidates in the Colonies by the Society.Auckland Star, vol.XVII, issue 245, 18 October 1886, p.2: A learned and obliging society Retrieved 3 February 2014 > \\"We shall be pleased to add your name to the list of Fellows of the Society > of Science, Letters and Art, of London. We are admitting the principal men > of science, letters and art from all parts of the world. With Sir H.V. > Goold's compliments.\\"Auckland Star, 18 October 1886 It was understood that the Society's practice was to send out, along with the above note and the SSLA Journal, a proposal of fellowship already stamped with the acceptance of Goold himself, and with the recipient's name left blank. The Journal stated that in return for an annual subscription of one guinea or a single life membership costing five guineas, 1,000 Foundation Fellowships were not only offered to eminent scientists, but also to anyone merely \\"engaged in science, literature or art, including music and the fine arts; also to those who are most active in promoting the interests and objects of the society.\\" After the first 1,000 places were filled, an unlimited number of remaining applicants were to be called Ordinary Fellows, and were to pay double the fees. In return for their guineas and for writing their names on the proposal form, members were permitted to append the initials \\"F.S.Sc.\\" to their names, and to wear gowns and hoods. The conclusion was as follows: > \\"The Society seems, in short, to be founded on the continental system by > which the right to use magic letters and titles, usually associated with > degrees, can be purchased without examination. Such a system, to our mind, > can only have an injurious effect upon true science and art - in the > colonies certificates so obtained might be used by unqualified persons to > impose upon the public as skilled teachers - and if the Society is earnest > in its purposes, and wishes to earn the confidence of the scientific and art > world, the sooner it alters its methods the better.\\"Auckland Star, 18 > October 1886 In 1892, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans described the Society as \\"bogus.\\"The Times-Picayune 17 November 1892 Rebuttals On 6 March 1884, The Times printed a rebuttal by Sir H.V. Goold. This reply to the Royal Society of Arts set out the aims of the Society and declared that many of its members were also members of the Society of Arts (although he did not mention that they wanted their money back). On 3 January 1894, The New Zealand Herald printed a rebuttal by the former embezzler and writer Joseph Ostler (1827‚Äì1905), alias C. Frusher Howard F.S.Sc. He was referring to similar comments which had been printed in London Truth and the Herald.

The Hon.

Ref.t18920912-847 Retrieved 7 February 2014 The International and the SSLA were not rivals: while his swindle was still functioning Tomie has written to Sturman in friendship, saying, \\"There is plenty of room for both of us, and though we work on somewhat similar lines, they need not be opposing ones.\\"Evening Post, New Zealand, Volume XLV, Issue 132, 7 June 1893, p.2: A bogus literary society Retrieved 6 February 2014 According to Labouch√®re, Dr Sturman explained that his M.A. was an honorary degree from the University of Washington, and that he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Even if this were true, it gives no evidence of a doctorate. According to Sturman, the Society had been established in 1882 with three other members: Goold, a Miss Button who had since died, and Rev. Irvine Coates.Note: It has not been possible to trace an Irvine Coates alive in England and Wales in 1882 Sturman said that in 1892 the Society consisted of \\"1,500 men and women interested in learning and education\\" but that they were reluctant to continue to pay their guineas for membership, and that he \\"got as many as we can get out of them.\\" From the Society's income, Sturman in his capacity as Secretary would officially receive ¬£300 per annum plus the Society's rent for his Holland Road establishment, and his wife would receive ¬£50 as Lady Secretary. Goold officially gave his services free. However Sturman was not able to say that he did not take all the income for his family and share some of it with Goold. He \\"lived on the Society and was the Society.\\" The majority of the Society's income came from school examinations; this consisted of mailing out exam papers and not examining candidates. Sturman sold diplomas and \\"shared the proceeds with Goold . . . the examinations were a farce.\\" Labouch√®re said, E.R. Tregear, who refused the Society's Fellowship > \\"It seems to me that the same result might be obtained much more > economically if the \\"Fellows\\" of all these concerns would keep their guineas > in their pockets and write themselves down \\"A.S.S.\\" without permission of > anybody.\\" Fellows and members of the Society were too embarrassed by their own gullibility to take Sturman to Court. Since this 1892 expos√© in Truth limited the Society's activities in Europe, Sturman turned to the Colonies for his guineas. However by the following year newspapers as far away as New Zealand had picked up the story, and the Society's infamy was going before it. In Auckland, The Evening Post of 7 June 1893 heard that Edward Robert Tregear, author of The Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionary (1891) had received an unexpected silver medallion from the Society - posted in March and sent by the slow boat - along with the Journal and the usual offer of Fellowship in return for the usual guineas. He refused the Fellowship. Thus continued around the world the disabusement of academics and would-be academics about the Society.

Built in 1754, it is the oldest house in the city. It was owned by the Hollingsworth family for almost 200 years and is typical of the Shenandoah Valley architecture of the Scotch-Irish settlers. The property was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register (VLR) in 1972 and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1973. Abram's Delight currently serves as a historic house museum. History In 1728, Abraham Hollingsworth (born 1686), grandson of Valentine Hollingsworth, a Quaker immigrant from Ireland, arrived in the Shenandoah Valley and settled in present-day Winchester. He received a land grant of around 1732 from Alexander Ross and Morgan Bryan, though he had to later renegotiate the grant with Lord Fairfax, who owned all the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. Some historians believe Hollingsworth was also required to pay local Shawnee members a cow, a calf, and a piece of red cloth for the land. Hollingsworth, considered the founder of Winchester, described his land a \\"delight to behold.\\" He built a log cabin next to a natural spring and just west of where the current house is located. Although the cabin no longer stands, the cabin's hand-dug well is still visible. Historians believe a wooden stockade once surrounded his home and that he began construction of the present house before his death in 1748. His widow, Ann Robinson (born around 1690), inherited the property but died the following year. Their second son, Isaac (1722-1759), a Quaker minister, inherited the property and made plans for a house that could also serve as a Quaker meeting place. Simon Taylor was chosen to build the home. He had recently completed construction of Springdale for Colonel John Hite, now the oldest house in Frederick County, and the two homes share similar stonework. Quakers held meetings in the Hollingsworth house with men sitting in the parlor and women in the dining room. Isaac's son, Jonah Hollingsworth (1755-1801), later inherited the property. He and his wife, Hannah (1755-1836), had thirteen children and needed more living space. Around 1800, they added a west wing to the house and used stone closely resembling that of the original portion. In 1830, one of their sons, David (1789-1859), a wealthy businessman and community leader, took possession of the home. He made many improvements to the house and surrounding land, most notably the construction of a lake on the south side of the property. He built a summer house on one of the islands in the lake. David's three children inherited the property in 1863, two years after the Civil War began. During the war, many properties in Winchester and the surrounding area suffered, including the Hollingsworth home. Most of the property's trees were felled, the livestock was taken, and the farmland was left untended. The three children, none of whom ever married, continued living in the house until the youngest, Annie (1844-1930), was the last one remaining. In the 1910s, Annie made arrangements with two cousins that they could take ownership of the house if they would care for her in her old age. She moved out of the home, taking only her clothing, and the building sat unoccupied for almost thirty years. In 1943, the city of Winchester purchased the home and surrounding . The city wanted to preserve the oldest house in Winchester and to take advantage of the water supply. The remaining belongings in the home, including many antiques dating from the 17th century and paintings by Annie's older sister, Mary, were sold at auction in 1945. The Winchester-Frederick County Historical Society worked for nine years on restoration of the house with Irvan O'Connell overseeing the overall project and Mary Boxley overseeing the interior work. In 1961, the house was opened as a museum. A log cabin, built in 1780 and similar to the one built by Abraham, was moved to the property in 1967. Abram's Delight was added to the VLR on November 9, 1972, and the NRHP on April 11, 1973. The property, which is reportedly haunted by several ghosts, is available for tours each day from April-October. During the Christmas season, Abram's Delight is available for tours during the annual Candlelight Tour and Open House. In addition to the house and log cabin, there is a small perennial garden and old gristmill that now serves as a gift shop and exhibit space. Architecture Abram's Delight is considered an \\"excellent example of a substantial eighteenth century Valley farmhouse\\" and the central hall two-over-two plan is a classic example of the early settlers' architecture. The exterior of the house is made of random rubble limestone and rests on a stone foundation. Slate covers the pitched roof. The original portion is three bays wide and measures . The wing added in 1800 is also three bays wide and measures long. Both sections of the home are two-stories, though the wing is not as tall in deference to the original portion. There are three interior-end chimneys, one on the end of the wing and one on each end of the original portion. There are five doorways, two on the north side, two on the south side, and one on the east side.

Taxonomy The species was formally described in 1786 by German botanist Georg Forster, who gave it the name Ophrys squamata. It was then transferred to the genus Cymbidium as Cymbidium squamatum by the Swedish botanist Olof Swartz in 1800. In 1810, Scottish botanist Robert Brown noted the similarity of Cymbidium squamatum to his newly erected genus Dipodium, but did not make the combination, thus the commonly used author citation Dipodium squamatum (G.Forst.) R.Br. is incorrect.O'Byrne, P. 2013. A revision of Dipodium in Peninsular Malaysia. Malesian Orchid Journal, 12: 59‚Äì92.Brown, R. 1810. Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, p. 331. In 1819, the English botanist James Edward Smith provided the first valid combination for Dipodium squamatum in Rees's Cyclop√¶dia.Mabberley, D.J. 1983.

The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families records Dipodium punctatum as a synonym of this species. In Australia, however, Dipodium punctatum is an accepted name in the Australian Plant Census. In New Caledonia the name Dipodium punctatum var. squamatum is used to refer to the Dipodium species that occurs there. However Dipodium punctatum var. squamatum is recorded as an illegitimate name and a synonym of Dipodpium squamatum in the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. The earliest scientific collection of this species, from New Caledonia, is attributed to George Forster's father Johann Reinhold Forster. The elder Forster was the naturalist on James Cook's second expedition to the Pacific, and 19-year-old Georg was his assistant. Other early collections included that of Eug√®ne Vieillard from arid coastal areas at Balade in New Caledonia and by Scottish botanists John MacGillivray and William Grant Milne from the island of Aneityum, part of current day Vanuatu . Distribution According to the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, the distribution of this species includes New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Australia. In New Caledonia, the species occurs throughout Grande Terre and the Isle of Pines. In Vanuatu it is found on the southern islands of Aneityum and Erromango.

Completed in 1913, construction of the Beaux-Arts style building was funded by a wealthy Pennsylvania businessman. The building serves as the main branch for Winchester's library system. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and Virginia Landmarks Register (VLR) in 1969. History Judge John Handley (1835-1895), an Irish-American coal magnate and lawyer from Scranton, Pennsylvania, visited Winchester several times and admired the city for its Scotch-Irish heritage. In his will, he left $250,000 for the city to erect a library \\"for the free use of the people of the city of Winchester\\" and schools for the poor. Construction of the library, designed by New York architects Barney and Chapman, was not begun until 1908. The cornerstone ceremony on May 26 was preceded by a large parade. The building's fireproof construction and facilities were considered advanced at the time of completion. The total cost of construction and furnishings was $233,230. The library opened on August 21, 1913, and originally featured a 300-seat lecture hall, study rooms and conference areas. C. Vernon Eddy was Handley's first librarian, serving in that position until 1960. Originally only white patrons were allowed to visit the library; in December 1953 city officials began allowing all residents to use the facility, regardless of race. The library was listed on the VLR on September 9, 1969, and the NRHP on November 12, 1969. It is also designated a contributing property to the Winchester Historic District, listed on the NRHP in 1980. Architectural firm Smithey and Boynton of Roanoke designed an addition that was completed in 1979. Their work resulted in a first honor award from the American Institute of Architects. Dennis Kowal Architects of Somerville, New Jersey prepared a full historic preservation plan in 1997 and oversaw the comprehensive restoration and rehabilitation in 1999. In 2001, Dennis Kowal was awarded the Lucille Lozier Award by Preservation of Historic Winchester, Inc. for the \\"outstanding restoration\\" of the Handley Regional Library. Architecture The Handley Library is \\"perhaps Virginia's purest expression of the regal and florid Beaux-Arts classicism.\\" It was designed to resemble an open book, with the dome representing the spine and the wings representing the covers. The limestone building consists of an octagonal base and a central dome. A three-arched entrance faces the intersection of Braddock and Piccadilly Streets. Two wings flank the dome and feature single-pitched roofs with dormer lights, balustrades and Ionic colonnades. Heavy stone reliefs of figures and fruit flank several windows and doors.

Telugu has a very rich literary tradition, starting in the 11th century A.D. Although there are more than forty adaptions of the Valmiki Ramayana which are partly or completely in Telugu, only four adaptions have covered the entire theme of the original epic. They are Ranganatha Ramayana, Bhaskar Ramayana, Molla Ramayana, and Ramayana Kalpavriksham. Ranganatha Ramayana was written by the poet Ranganatha‚Äîalso known as Gona Budda Reddy‚Äîbetween 1300 and 1310 A.D. This Ramayana was composed in 17,290 couplets (in Dwipada metre). This meter is lyrical and can either be recited like the Valmiki Ramayana (written in Anustupa metre) or sung like the Ramcharitmanas (written in Doha-Chaupai). It is quite popular with both scholars and illiterates. It was published by Rayalu and Co, Kadapa in 1949. Structure Although Ranganatha follows the theme of the Valmiki Ramayana, he still made changes in some incidents which effects the course of events. The theme of the Ranganatha Ramayana has been classified under seven cantos. * Bala Kanda (Chapter: Childhood; ‡∞¨‡∞æ‡∞≤ ‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞°): This covers the theme starting from the conversation between Valmiki and Narada to the return of Rama to Ayodhya after his marriage with Sita from Mithila.This canto describes an incident connected with young Rama and Manthara (whereas in the Valmiki Ramayana, Manthara's entry is in Ayodhya kanda). When Rama was playing with a ball and a stick, suddenly Manthara threw the ball far away from Rama. In anger, Rama struck her on the knee with the stick and her knee was broken. This message was conveyed to king Dasaratha by Kaikeyi. The king decided to send Rama and his other sons to school. This incident makes the king to think about his responsibility of educating his sons, so that they can learn and become wise. Manthara had developed a kind of antagonism towards Rama and was waiting for an opportunity to take revenge against him. * Ayodhya Kanda (Chapter: Ayodhya; ‡∞Ö‡∞Ø‡±ã‡∞ß‡±ç‡∞Ø‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞°) * Aranya Kanda (Chapter: Forest; ‡∞Ö‡∞∞‡∞£‡±ç‡∞Ø‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞°) * Kishkindha Kanda (Chapter: Kishkindha; ‡∞ï‡∞ø‡∞∑‡±ç‡∞ï‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞° ) * Sundara Kanda (Chapter: Beautiful;‡∞∏‡±Å‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞∞‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞° ) * Yudha Kanda (Chapter: War;‡∞Ø‡±Å‡∞¶‡±ç‡∞ß‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞°) * Uttara Kanda (Chapter: Last;‡∞â‡∞§‡±ç‡∞§‡∞∞‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞°) Blessing of Squirrel Ranganatha added some significant incidents to make the theme more natural and reliable. For example, when the bridge was built, a squirrel thinks that it should help Rama to achieve his end; it rolls down in the sand and gets rid of the sand on the bridge under construction. Knowing this, Rama blesses squirrel for its devotion and draws three lines on its back with his fingers. The three white lines on the back of squirrels are supposed to have come into existence in this way.

He was best known as the business partner of Lang Hancock. After his death, his estate became worth over 1 billion. Early life and education Wright was born in Kalgoorlie to parents who were originally from Victoria. The family moved to Perth at a young age and Wright was educated at several schools, including Hale School. He left school before graduating. In 1932 he married Pauline McClemans, daughter of William McClemans, an Anglican clergyman who founded Christ Church Grammar School. Business career After leaving school, he joined the Bank of New South Wales. In 1930 he qualified as an accountant and set up his own accountancy firm. In 1938 he became general manager of his father's firm F. W. Wright & Co, later becoming managing director when it became Wright Ltd in 1949. During the late 1930s, Wright joined with former schoolmate Lang Hancock in a mining venture in the north-west of Western Australia, beginning a partnership that lasted for several decades. One of their early ventures was an asbestos mine at Wittenoom, Western Australia. In 1969 Wright and his partner Lang Hancock commenced publication in Perth of a weekly newspaper The Sunday Independent principally to help further their mining interests. Hancock largely relinquishing his interest in it in the early 70s but Wright continued publishing it until selling it to The Truth in 1984. Death and legacy Wright died in 1985 in Bangkok, Thailand while travelling home to Perth from Europe. He was cremated at Karrakatta Cemetery. In 1985 Business Review Weekly (BRW) estimated his net at least 50 million. By 2013, the magazine valued his family's worth at 1.53 billion. The rise in the value was largely a result of royalty agreements signed by Hancock and Wright during the 1960s. The agreements entitled Hancock and Wright 2.5 percent of revenue generated by Rio Tinto's Hamersley Iron mines.

Emma Bell & Neil Mitchel, Intellect, 2012. Dafydd's later years in Ammanford at Amman Valley Grammar School present an ordinary man with extraordinary virtues. His innate dignity is seen here as an inspiration to the film‚Äôs narrator Ifor Morgan, who recalls in adulthood his experiences as a school pupil under David‚Äôs wing. The actual David Griffiths never achieved the fame of his brother, the miners' leader and first Welsh secretary Jim Griffiths, but here represents a traditional Welsh proletarian \\"type\\", who communicates a strong sense of his community's worth and retains a fierce loyalty to the memory of his fellow pitmen. The film‚Äôs most poignant section deals with the impact on David of the death of his son, Gwilym, from tuberculosis, and the effect on Ifor and his fellow pupils of the caretaker's temporary estrangement from them as he retreats into himself and his memories. Dafydd is also shown leaving the Eisteddfod after his poem, an elegy to his dead son, has failed to win the coveted Chair. Amanwy did win several other chairs which can be found in church halls around South Wales.

Founded in 1924 by Methodist missionary Reverend Stanley Drummond from Cobar, today Royal Far West works in partnership with families, schools, healthcare providers, local government and community groups, offering health, education and disability services for country children and their families at its Centre for Country Kids in Manly, as well as virtually via Telecare and in local rural and remote communities. The charity's mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of children and young people who live in rural and remote communities. Royal Far West's Centre for Country Kids opened in December 2018. This purpose-built, state-of-the-art facility integrates specialist paediatric services with the Royal Far West Department of Education School, enabling the charity to support and strengthen the resilience and wellbeing of children and families in Australia's rural communities. Royal Far West's Patron is the Governor of New South Wales, General The Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Ret'd).  History  The first Far West camp was organised in 1925, taking 58 children and six mothers from towns including Bourke, Brewarrina and Wilcannia to Cronulla. The following year the camp was held at Manly for the first time In Manly, the operator of a local cottage hospital, Dr George Moncrieff Barron, volunteered his services free of charge, and would continue to do so until his death. Land would later be purchased in Wentworth Street, allowing the Drummond Far West Children's Home to be built. The original facility provided 80 beds. An idea conceived by a doctor from the remote NSW town of Trangie was adopted by Far West in 1931 which saw it operating mobile baby clinics staffed by nurses out of converted railway carriages along railway lines in the west of the state. By 1954, four carriages had been converted and were the only of their type in the world. The Far West Scheme also developed an aerial transport service in the 1930s and successfully lobbied the New South Wales Government to pay for the construction of airstrips to allow better access to communities. Stanley Drummond met Nancy Bird Walton in 1935 and soon hired her to provide the air ambulance service on behalf of the scheme. Walton used her own aircraft, and later was appointed Officer Order of the British Empire in honour of her dedication to this service in 1966. The prefix Royal was granted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970. Reverend Stanley Drummond died in 1943 and was succeeded by his brother, Norman Drummond, as chairman, and he remained in the role until his death in 1983.  NSW Department of Education Royal Far West School  A public school was established at the children's home in Manly in 1938, catering to children who required extended stays for ongoing treatment. The school is equipped to work with students from preschool to Year 12, many of whom require a high level of support and assistance for behavioural and learning difficulties. Siblings of client children also attend the school while staying at Manly. The school also participates reading and literacy programs across the state. A world first, in December 2018 the school moved into the brand new Centre for Country Kids, integrating the school with the charity's specialist paediatric services.  Core Programs = Telecare for Kids  This award-winning program connects country children with specialist assessment, therapy and local capacity-building via videolink from their schools, homes and clinics. Telecare for Kids is growing rapidly, expanding into more schools and homes, with an increased emphasis on building the capacity of parents, teachers and early educators.  Paediatric Developmental Program (PDP)  The PDP is a benevolent multidisciplinary health service for children with complex developmental concerns and their families from rural and remote NSW who cannot access the local services they need. The PDP is a specialist service with expertise in supporting complex families, providing trauma-informed care and family-centred practice. This program is a partnership between NSW Health and Royal Far West.  Windmill  This is Royal Far West's innovative disability service dedicated to children aged 2‚Äì12 from rural and remote communities. In addition to intensive early intervention therapy blocks provided in Manly, the program uses Telecare to reach children in their homes and schools.  Healthy Kids Bus Stop  Delivered in collaboration with Ronald McDonald House Charities, Local Health Districts and schools, the Healthy Kids Bus Stop provides a unique developmental screening service to children aged 3 to 5 years across rural and remote NSW, enabling early identification of issues and a pathway to care so they can start school ready to learn.

In most instances the PPU is used in a PPE. The PPU is a 64-bit dual-threaded in-order PowerPC 2.02 microprocessor core designed by IBM for use primarily in the game consoles PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but has also found applications in high performance computing in supercomputers such as the record setting IBM Roadrunner. The PPU is used as a main CPU core in three different processor designs: * The Cell Broadband Engine (Cell BE) which is used primarily in Sony's PlayStation 3 gaming console. It uses the PPE and comes in three versions, a 90 nm, a 65 nm and a 45 nm part. * The PowerXCell 8i which is a version of the Cell BE with enhanced FPU and memory subsystem. It was only manufactured as a single 65 nm version. * The XCPU which is used in a three core configuration and a unified 1 MB L2 cache inside Microsoft's Xbox 360. It comes in three versions, the 90 nm and 65 nm versions, and the 45 nm XCGPU with an integrated graphics processor from ATI.  Main features  * 64-bit, dual-threaded core * 3.2 GHz typical clockrate * 32 KB L1 instruction cache * 32 KB L1 data cache * 512 KB unified L2 cache, 8-way set associative in the PPE variant. * Compatible with 64-bit PowerPC ISA v.2.02 (POWER4 and PowerPC 970) * AltiVec SIMD functionality  Execution units  * Branch Unit (BRU) * Fixed Point Integer Unit (FXU) * Load and Store Unit (LSU) * Floating- Point Unit (FPU) * Vector Media Extension Unit (VMX)  In-order  The PPU is an in-order processor, but it has some unique traits which allow it to achieve some benefits of out-of-order execution without expensive re-ordering hardware. Upon reaching an L1 cache miss - it can execute past the cache miss, stopping only when an instruction is actually dependent on a load. It can send up to 8 load instructions to the L2 cache out-of-order. It has an instruction delay pipe - a side path that allows it to execute instructions that would normally cause pipeline stalls without holding up the rest of the pipeline. The instruction delay pipeline is used for the Out-Of-Order Load/Stores: cache misses are put there while it moves on.  The PPE's Pipeline  The PPE has a 23 stage general pipeline with an additional 11 stages possible for Microcode and an additional 4 stages possible for Branch Prediction. Cell Broadband Engine Architecture and its first implementation  Multithreading  The PPU runs two hardware threads simultaneously. The main registers for code execution are duplicated, as are the exception and interrupt-handling registers, and several essential arrays and queues. They can generate exceptions simultaneously, and perform branch prediction on their individual branch histories. The execution engine and caches are not duplicated though - so it is still just a single-core design.Chapter 2 - The Power Processing Element (PPE)  Floating point capacity  Its 64-bit double precision floating-point unit, and 128-bit VMX unit (using the AltiVec instruction set), can perform a theoretical 12 floating-point operations per cycle, as its floating-point unit can do floating-point multiply-adds, and come no smaller than 64-bits. That gives 3.2 billion clock cycles √ó 12 = 38.4 billion floating-point operations/second. The PPU is enhanced in the PowerXCell 8i processor to be able to make single cycle double precision floating point operations, tailored for high performance computing in supercomputers. The VMX unit in the XCPU in the Xbox 360 is enhanced with 128 registers and is not entirely compatible with regular AltiVec.

Biography Soerip was born in Banyuwangi, East Java, Dutch East Indies, on 22 October 1921. She only completed two years of elementary school before she dropped out. She later became a kroncong singer, often billed as Miss Soerip. Owing to her habit of batting her eyelashes while singing, she was also nicknamed \\"Si Mata Roda\\". In 1940 Soerip made her feature film debut in Zoebaida, directed by Njoo Cheong Seng for Oriental Film. This was followed in 1941 by Panggilan Darah, in which Soerip was cast with Dhalia as orphaned sisters who try to make a living in the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta). When the company folded, unable to recoup its expenses, Soerip migrated to Majestic Film. She completed three productions for the company: Air Mata Iboe, Djantoeng Hati, and Pantjawarna. After the Japanese occupation of the Indies in March 1942, in which all but one domestic film studio was shut down, Soerip took a thirty-year hiatus from film, only returning to the industry in 1973 for Sopir Taxi. Owing to her age, she took the honorific Mbah (Grandmother), and was billed Mbah Soerip. During the following two decades she completed a further 20 films, including productions by Slamet Rahardjo, Teguh Karya, and Wim Umboh. A retrospective in Apa Siapa Film Indonesia particularly praises her performance in Rahardjo's Rembulan dan Matahari (1979). In 1990 Soerip made her last film, Cintaku di Way Kambas, and a soap opera, Bayang-Bayang. That year she was recognised by the National Film Council for her dedication to acting.

It was used as a state car and pictures of the President of the French Republic sitting in a Nervastella can therefore be seen in newsreels from the mid-1930s. The car was a smaller brother to the Renault Reinastella which had been launched a year earlier, but the Nervastella was technically more advanced, and with a wheelbase it was still, by the standards of the time and place, large. In the early 1930s Renault introduced a number of models with names that ended in \\"-stella\\", which was a conscious reference to the Latin word for a \\"star\\".http://www.renault.de/renault-welt/unternehmen/historische- modelle/renault-nervastella/ Engines The car was powered by a 8-cylinder in-line engine, but the size of the power unit changed through the car's production run. The Nervastella was launched with a 4241 cc engine for which of power was listed, achieved at a then impressively quick 3300 rpm. The engine size grew to 4825 cc in 1933 and increased again, for 1935, to 5448 cc. The 1933 increase was not accompanied by any increase in claimed maximum power for the standard Nervastella, and even the 1935 engine capacity increase only raised the listed output to .  Evolution  The car originally appeared as a four-door \\"Berline\\" (saloon/sedan) or as a \\"Coup√© de ville\\" (large two door luxury coup√©). The range was extended a year later with the long wheel-base \\"six-light\\" limousine with an extra pair of side windows between the C-pillar and the rear doors and space for five or seven people. A reduced specification version, sharing the 4241 cc engine of the Nervastella, badged as the Renault Nervahuit was exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October 1930 and offered during 1931. The Nervahuit's starting price in January 1931, of 48,000 francs for a torpedo bodied car, compared with a starting price for a standard \\"Berline\\" (saloon/sedan) bodied Nervastella of 95,000 francs. There was a complete model change in 1932: the word \\"a√©rodynamique\\" is much in evidence in reports on the Renault range in the early 1930s. The \\"Nervastella ZD2\\" cars now received \\"American-style\\" pressed-steel bodies with mildly sloping tails associated with the newly arriving \\"aerodynamic\\" fashion of the time. In this form, the Nervastella was effectively a longer wheel base version of the manufacturer's (already substantial) Vivastella model. The \\"standard\\" wheelbase Nervastella sat on the same wheelbase as the \\"long\\" wheelbase Vivastella, which for the Nervastella came with body types that included the \\"Berline a√©rodynamique\\" with seating for five at 49,000 francs. A longer wheelbase supported the \\"Conduite interieure a√©rodynamique\\" with seating for seven, listed at 52,000 francs. Both these were effectively large sedan/saloon bodied cars. There was also a lighter, sportire, and less well-equipped model introduced in March 1932, the Nervasport. A price reduction of 2000 francs was available to any customer prepared to order a Nervastella with the previous year's bodywork, which could have reflected a backlog of unsold cars, or may simply indicate the high cost of the new steel presses needed to form the more subtly shaped less slab-sided car bodies coming into fashion at this time. In addition to the standard bodied cars, the Nervastella could still be purchased in base chassis form for the fitting of more exclusive \\"bespoke\\" bodywork. The Nervastella ABM6 was exhibited as a 1937 model at the 30th Paris Motor Show in October 1936. By this time the only body type offered for the Nervastella was the \\"six-light\\" limousine, using the manufacturer's \\"long\\" wheelbase chassis. The engine size had grown to 5448 cc and claimed maximum power was up to . There was also, this year, a related Renault Nerva Grand Sport Type ABM7 with a wheelbase of \\"only\\" and offered with a small selection of large two-door \\"Coach\\" and \\"Cabriolet\\" style bodies.

In 1952 Hansen would record a set of selections from the operetta with Elisabeth S√∂derstr√∂m, Arne Andersson and Hasse Funck, conducted by Sune Waldimir on the Musica label (SK 19854-5). The filming of Sk√∂na Helena started around May 1950 and was completed by the middle of July. An Arcadian quayside was built around the jetty at Stensunds dockyard, while other sets were constructed in and around Sandrew's studios at G√§rdet in Stockholm. The film had its premiere on 26 December 1951 at the Royal cinema in Stockholm as well as several other Swedish towns and cities.Swedish Film Institute essay on Sk√∂na Helena. accessed 15 January 2014. Eva Dahlbeck (Helena), at this time early in her career, would soon play Desir√©e Armfeldt in Bergman's film Smiles of a Summer Night. Helena's vocal numbers were sung and dubbed by Kjerstin Dellert, whose professional debut was in New York, and had just made her Swedish debut ‚Äì in Offenbach's Belle H√©l√®ne ‚Äì at the Grand Theatre in Gothenburg the same year.Kjerstin Dellert biography at the Kungliga Teaterns Solister website accessed 15 January 2014.

Synopsis Sandwiched between the East and the West, is the neutral, small, carefree kingdom of Arcadia. Its two powerful neighbours vie for world domination. The eastern neighbour's ruler Trojanus has recently taken several minor states under his \\"protection\\". Prince Paris is shackled and put aboard a Trojan ship as a galley-slave. Trojanus believes that the Arcadian province Thermopylae, with its mountain passes would make a useful route to the west and begins an intrigue to usurp the area peacefully. He has sought the support of Arcadia's royalists, who form a treacherous fifth column. Meanwhile, Arcadia is unaware of all these plans. Under an assumed name King Menelaus amuses himself playing ping-pong with the delightful fashion model L√§spia. Unbeknown to the King the plotting Calchas has made a deal with Trojanus' ambassador, Hector, for a marriage for Menelaus. The chosen consort is the Trojan beauty queen Helen. When the king is told of his imminent entry into matrimony, he is dismayed; the prospect of a foreign wife by his side and having to abandon L√§spia does not appeal to him. L√§spia discovers that her wooer is the king himself, and starts a counter-plot to out-manoeuvre the future queen. When Helena arrives, she takes her place in the chamber of honour. L√§spia is supported by the United States of Rome who want to prevent Trojanus getting power over the Arcadian king through marriage. To this end, Secret Service man Hercules is despatched to her aid. Hercules frees Paris, and a meeting is arranged between Paris and Helen. The result is just as L√§spia and Hercules had hoped: Helena falls in love with the beautiful singing prince and rejects the king. However, Menelaus has inadvertently consumed a love potion meant for Paris, and is consumed by a violent desire for Helena. Despite Helena's chilly responses to the love-sick Menelaus, Hector urges her to marry the king. The Trojan ambassador is still hoping for a lease on Thermopylae, and the prospect of a wedding night with beauty queen leads Menelaus on when the marriage contract is drawn up. On the wedding night L√§spia enters the bedroom and manages to lock Paris in there. When Menelaus enters, he realizes that his new wife is unfaithful, by counting the number of feet sticking out from the end of the bed. L√§spia's scheme has succeeded. Helena flees to Paris and returns the contract. Menelaus wakes finally to the danger threatening his country and sends the royalist party's fifth column to the East and ten thousand troops to Thermopylae to defend the province. Helena is forced to cancel her flight to put her seal on a royal divorce. Menelaus may now join L√§spia and make her the new queen of Arcadia.

However, the way that the plot became a political farce ‚Äì depicting emerging East-West relations ‚Äì was not to the taste of Stockholm newspaper critics. One of them (Gunnar Oldin) went so far as to claim that the film had become ‚Äúa mixture of Offenbach and the Soviet defector Kravchenko‚Äù. Eva Dahlbeck's role was compared to the lead in the 1939 film Ninotchka, and others complained about the excessive number of \\"...gags, anachronisms and whimsy.Swedish Film Institute essay on Sk√∂na Helena; Comments. accessed 15 January 2014. Communist MP and editor of the 'New Day' paper, Gustav Johansson claimed that \\"old Offenbach has been mobilized in America's cold war against the peace movement\\". The female critic 'Lill' in the 'Svenska Dagbladet' was happier with the film's mixture of operetta action and political satire, with its many witty and elegant moments and a seamless flow of song numbers.

He was the first president of the Federal Supreme Court (1848‚Äì1850) and president of the National Council in 1850‚Äì1851. Kernstrasse in Z√ºrich is named for him.  Early life  Kern was born into a wealthy family in 1808 in Berlingen in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. He attended school at Diessenhofen and Z√ºrich before enrolling at the University of Basel in 1828, where he studied theology briefly before transferring to Heidelberg University to study law. He graduated with honours in 1830 and began practicing law in Berlingen in 1831.  Political career  Kern married Aline Freyenmuth in 1834, with whom he then relocated to Frauenfeld, Thurgau's capital. Freyenmuth was the daughter of a cantonal government councillor, which led Kern to become involved in Thurgau's political sphere. Kern would serve as a member of the Thurgau Cantonal Council from 1832 until 1853, including nine terms as president, during which time he helped to revise the canton's constitution, authored its criminal code, and sat on the education committee. Kern represented Thurgau at the Tagsatzung, the federal council of delegates from each canton, in 1833‚Äì38, 1840‚Äì42, and 1845‚Äì48. In 1848 he was elected to the National Council and held the presidency in 1850‚Äì1851, leaving the assembly in 1854; during this time he also served as a federal judge in the Federal Supreme Court, where he was president in 1848‚Äì1850. He was a major contributor to the writing of the new Swiss Constitution in 1848, the country's first federal constitution, and in 1854 he helped to establish the federal technical university Eidgen√∂ssische Polytechnische Schule (now ETH Zurich). From 1853 to 1857, he was also the director of the Swiss Northeastern Railway company. Kern declined an 1849 appointment to a Swiss ambassadorship in Vienna, but later represented Switzerland internationally. In 1856 he was sent to Paris to partake in the mediation of the Neuch√¢tel Crisis with Napoleon III, and the next year he took up a formal post as Minister of Switzerland in Paris. During this time, he failed to mediate in the 1870‚Äì71 Franco-Prussian War, but provided assistance to Swiss nationals living in war-torn France. He resigned in 1882.  Later years  After his retirement, Kern moved to Paris between 1883 and 1886 to write a memoir of his 50-year political career titled (Political Reminiscences 1833 to 1883). He then returned to Z√ºrich, where he died in 1888 after having a stroke.

It held that the ability of environmental protection authorities to demand information that could potentially be self-incriminating was not the same as requiring people incriminate themselves in trials. Therefore, a company that had been found to have unlawfully stored dangerous clinical waste could be compelled to produce evidence of further breaches. Facts In June 1996 Green Environmental Industries Ltd and Mr John Moynihan were charged with offences under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.See the case report in [2000] 2 AC 412 In November 1995 a 100 tonnes of clinical waste (including placenta, needles and glass) was found in trailers and at a warehouse near in the Rookery Transport Cafe near Hatfield, and in the centre of Hertford, on Ware Road at the Addis factory site. The property was leased or licensed to GEI Ltd, which did not have a licence for its storage. Moynihan as director and sole shareholder was asked by the council on 23 November 1995 to remove the waste or the council would under EPA 1990 ss 33 and 59 do it at Moynihan‚Äôs expense. Moynihan replied by fax, and the council removed the waste for ¬£200,000. Two weeks later, under EPA 1990 section 71(2) it demanded that Moynihan provide details of (1) people, companies and hospitals hat had supplied waste to Green (2) who carried waste on its behalf (3) staff employed to handle the waste (4) companies Green employed to dispose of the waste (5) suppliers or hirers of the trailers (6) keepers of any vehicles used to collect the waste (7) locations of any other sites Green used and (8) where three bins previously at the site now were. On the advice of his solicitor, Green replied he would give information if he was given the assurance that none of it would be used a prosecution. The council stood its ground and on 6 February 1996 Moynihan lost his case in front of a magistrate, and appeals to the High Court and Court of Appeal were dismissed. Moynihan and GEI Ltd argued that EPA 1990 s 71 breach the right to a fair trial and against self- incrimination under ECHR art 6. Judgment Lord Hoffmann held that according to domestic law, and the jurisprudence of the ECHR, the EPA 1990 s 70 did not breach the privilege against self-incrimination, nor ECHR art 6 right to a fair trial. The information that had to be given was only due before any hearing took place, and there was no guarantee that proceedings would ever be brought.

Almost everyone in the tiny Maine hamlet comes to love Jacobs, his beautiful wife, and his young son. Things change all too suddenly when Mrs. Jacobs and her child die in a gruesome auto accident. Stricken with grief, the reverend denounces God and religion during a sermon, is banished from the town, and spends many years pursuing a career as a sideshow huckster before pretending to regain his belief in God and becoming a prolific faith healer, fuelled by lifelong experiments with electricity. Jamie, meanwhile, grows up to become a musician and begins using heroin, which stops when he meets Jacobs again ‚Äì Jacobs' unorthodox electrical treatment successfully cures him of his addiction. After being treated, Jamie experiences strange side effects, including sleepwalking and jabbing himself in the arm with sharp objects while in a fugue state, as if trying to inject heroin. This leads him to start looking into the many others that Jacobs has healed. As it turns out, many of them have experienced similar side effects, and some have killed themselves and others as a result. Later, Jacobs contacts him; Jamie's childhood sweetheart, Astrid, has developed terminal cancer. Jacobs agrees to heal her, but only if Jamie will become his personal assistant for one last experiment. Jamie reluctantly agrees, and Astrid is cured. Jamie helps Jacobs prepare for his final experiment: Jacobs has discovered something he terms \\"secret electricity\\", an all-powerful energy source that he has been using to achieve his miraculous cures over the years. He now intends to harness a massive surge of this energy from a lightning rod and channel it into a terminally ill woman named Mary Fay, whom he has relocated to his lab. Jacobs' plan is to revive Mary Fay after her death, not in the conventional manner, but in the sense that she will be clinically dead and yet able to communicate with Jacobs and tell him of the afterlife and what fate befell his wife and child after their death. The experiment works, but not in the way Jacobs intends. The revived Mary Fay does become a doorway to the afterlife, but to the horror of both Jacobs and Jamie, there is no heaven and no reward for piety. Instead, the fate awaiting every living person is revealed to be \\"The Null\\", a dimension of chaos, where dead humans are enslaved for eternity by insane, Lovecraftian beings, the most powerful of which is known as \\"Mother\\". Mother inhabits the body of Mary Fay, transforming her into a grotesque monster, and attempts to kill Jacobs. Jamie shoots Mother with Jacobs' gun, and she leaves Mary's body. Jacobs has a fatal stroke, and Jamie arranges his body to make it look like he shot Mary. Jamie flees the scene and relocates to Hawaii. Later, many of the people cured by Jacobs go insane and kill themselves and others, including Astrid, who kills her partner and herself. Jamie, one of the few survivors of Jacobs' treatments, is left relying heavily on antidepressants. He acknowledges and takes some small comfort in the possibility that the visions were \\"lies,\\" but the novel ends with Jamie reflecting that no matter what happens, sooner or later he is going to die and end up trapped in The Null under the yoke of Mother. Reception Revival generally received positive reviews, with many critics noting the book's nods to classics of the horror genre, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan, and the cosmic- horror of H. P. Lovecraft. Danielle Trussoni of The New York Times described Revival as \\"pure Stephen King ... reading Revival is experiencing a master storyteller having the time of his life.\\" Trussoni noted that the book \\"is filled with cultural allusions both high and low: In addition to the Bible and Frankenstein, there are references to Thomas Edison's work at Menlo Park, Dan Brown, The X-Files, the Forbidden Books (that is, grimoires banned and burned by the Catholic Church) ... As the Kingian references pile up, and become layered into the events of the fictional world, you fall deeper and deeper under the story's spell, almost believing that Jamie's nightmarish experiences actually happened.\\"Trussoni, Danielle (2014-11-21). \\"Stephen King's 'Revival.'\\" NYTimes.com. Retrieved 2016-10-22. Elizabeth Hand, writing in The Washington Post also highlights Revivals influences: \\"King's restrained prose explodes in an ending that combines contemporary realism with cosmic horror reminiscent of H. P. Lovecraft's fiction and the classic film Quatermass and the Pit. The tormented relationship between Jamie Morton and Charles Jacobs takes on the funereal shading of an Arthur Miller tragedy.\\" King's storytelling is praised as offering \\"the atavistic pleasure of drawing closer to a campfire in the dark to hear a tale recounted by someone who knows exactly how to make every listener's flesh crawl when he whispers, 'Don't look behind you.'\\"Hand, Elizabeth (2014-11-10). \\"Book Review: 'Revival,' by Stephen King.\\" WashingtonPost.com.

Other reviews were less enthusiastic, with The Guardians Ben East describing Revivals ending as \\"a bit odd.\\" East praises the story's beginning, but opined that \\"Revival takes a turn for the ridiculous\\" after moving past the protagonist's childhood. \\"In the context of a novel with so many interesting things to say about growing up and growing old in the 21st century, the more fantastical elements feel a little silly.\\"East, Ben (2014-11-16). \\"Revival by Stephen King Review ‚Äì 'the best opening he has ever written.'\\" TheGuardian.com.

Club, offered a similar criticism: \\"Virtually all of Revival is a slow build that sometimes feels suspiciously like a shaggy-dog story, one which may not have a punchline. ... Revival could have trimmed all the buildup and instead been an extremely unnerving short story. King's fans, familiar with his sprawling voice and comfortably compelling style, may be perfectly content to hang out with him on this leisurely stroll toward eventual horror.\\"Robinson, Tasha (2014-11-10). \\"Stephen King‚Äôs Revival Is a Calculated Tease.\\" The A.V.

Such items may be natural and hardly processed (such as earth from the Holy Land), but majority of modern devotional articles are mass-produced (strips of paper with prayers, pictures of holy figures, prayer books, etc.) Such items are usually seen as having little artistic value, as their primary function is not decorative but spiritual. American sociologist Charles H. Lippy observed that such articles are \\"means of access to the supernatural\\", and are criticized by some as superstition.

This bay is an inlet of Loch Laxford, a sea loch and Special Area of Conservation. The river is well known for its salmon fly fishing, indeed the name \\"Laxford\\" derives from the Norse for \\"salmon fjord\\". The area is important geologically, being a region of shear in the Moine Thrust. A road bridge, Laxford Bridge, crosses the river adjacent to the A838 and A894 roads, the road junction making the spot well known to tourists. Laxford is in Sutherland, in the Highland council area of Scotland; Scourie, away, is the nearest village. The area forms part of the North West Sutherland National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. River Laxford Laxford Bridge crossing the River The River Laxford runs some in a generally northwesterly direction from Loch Stack (by Ben Stack) to Laxford Bay. It has a catchment area of about . The River Laxford is considered one of the more productive salmon rivers in northern Scotland with a catch of over 200 salmon in most seasons. Catches of sea trout, however, have declined in recent years. Loch Laxford Islands in Loch Laxford - the main one shown is Eilean √† Mhadaidh Laxford Bay is an inlet of Loch Laxford, a fjard sea loch. The loch is a Special Area of Conservation, classified as a large shallow inlet and bay - it has a wide variety of marine habitats and species. Water conditions are mostly sheltered because of the reefs and islands but the outer region of the loch is very exposed. It has the most extensive shoreline of sheltered sediment in the far northwest of Scotland. There are many small islands in the loch. Geology Laxfordian event Laxford is in the region of the Lewisian gneiss complex, deformed by Moine Thrust, which occurred during the Caledonian Orogeny. To the south are Scourian high-grade metamorphic rocks, some 3,000 million years old, intruded with undeformed Scourie dykes 2,400 million years ago whereas to the north are lower-grade metamorphic rocks, which were later deformed and metamorphosed during the Laxfordian orogeny. At Laxford, layers of pink granite and pegmatite intruded into hot gneiss about 1,750 million years ago. Alternating layers of black mafic gneiss and grey felsic gneiss are to be seen, cut across by steeply dipping sheets of granite and pegmatite. Laxford Bridge At Laxford Bridge the A838 road, coming northwest from Lairg on Scotland's northeast coast, joins the A894 coming from Loch Assynt, which is to the south. The A838 then crosses the river at the bridge and runs northeast to Durness on Scotland's north coast.

It originally aired on November 12, 2009. The episode was written by Bryan M. Holdman and Brian Young and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot The episode starts with Bonnie (Kat Graham) in class when she sees Emily (Bianca Lawson) and she leaves the class to follow her. Emily leads her to an old burned down building. Bonnie wakes up in the class screaming and everyone is staring at her. She turns around and sees Emily sitting right next to her and Bonnie wakes up again, this time for real, in the woods. A new history teacher, Alaric Saltzman (Matt Davis) walks into the class and introduces himself. After class, Bonnie describes Elena her dream thinking that she is haunted by Emily and that it might have something to do with the crystal she is wearing. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) tries to make nice for killing Lexi (Arielle Kebbel) and he explains Stefan (Paul Wesley) that he did it for them. He also promises not to feed on human for a week but Stefan is not really amused by his humor over the subject. Stefan later finds Elena at school and informs her that he will not be coming to school anymore or near her to protect her. Alaric calls Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) to give him a second chance after seeing his grades from Mr. Tanner's notes and he asks him to write a paper about local history. Jeremy thanks him and he notices the ring that Alaric wears, a ring that looks a lot like the ones Damon and Stefan have. He explains that it belonged to his father. Meanwhile, Damon confronts Bonnie and demands his necklace back but Bonnie is not giving it. Damon tells her that he knows about Emily haunting her and, before he leaves, he gives Bonnie a message for Emily: \\"A deal's a deal\\". Bonnie tells Elena about Damon as they drive home when suddenly she pulls the car over and throws the crystal into an open field. Elena calls Stefan to inform him about Damon and the crystal. Stefan explains that Emily was Katherine's handmaid and that the crystal was once belonged to Katherine. However, he does not know why Damon wants it so badly and he promises to find out. Jenna (Sara Canning) and Jeremy are at the Grill talking about his paper when she sees Alaric. Jeremy offers to introduce her but she declines and tells Jeremy that he can use his father's stuff for his paper. Alaric approaches and introduces himself and Jenna thanks him for giving Jeremy a second chance. Later Jeremy leaves and Jenna, being alone, goes and sits with Alaric at the bar. Alaric tells her that his wife died, implying that she was murdered. He later escorts Jenna back home but she does not invite him in because Jeremy is home. Elena tries for Bonnie and Caroline (Candice Accola) to make up. She invites Caroline for dinner, while Bonnie is already there. Caroline apologizes but she gets upset when Bonnie tells her that she threw the necklace away. But Caroline finds the necklace in Bonnie's purse and she accuses her of lying. Bonnie is surprised to see the crystal and wonders if Emily will ever leave her alone. Caroline does not understand anything and Bonnie tells her that she is a witch but Caroline does not believe her. Caroline apologizes once again to Bonnie and she gives her the necklace back. She then proposes the three of them to have a s√©ance. During the s√©ance, the candles flare, a cold wind blows in while Bonnie is calling for Emily. The window opens with a blast and the three girls freak out. Bonnie throws the crystal on the floor but when the lights come back on, the crystal is not there. Elena, Caroline and Bonnie search for the crystal when Elena sees a figure crossing the hallway and Bonnie sees the necklace in the bathroom. She goes in to get it but the door closes locking her inside. She starts screaming for help and Elena and Caroline try to open the door but they can't. Suddenly, the door opens and Bonnie seems fine but she is acting weird. The reflection in the mirror shows that Emily got into her body. Bonnie says she is fine and walks downstairs. Elena calls her but she is not answering and she realizes that Emily has possessed Bonnie's body. She tries to stop her from leaving the house but she cannot. In the meantime, Stefan is being friendly to Damon so he can be able to make him tell him why he wants the crystal. They play darts at the bar and later go to the football field to play football. While they are talking, Damon finally asks Stefan what does he want. Stefan starts talking about Katherine and tells him that what they felt about her was not real since she compelled them to think so. Damon doesn't want to talk about it and walks away. Stefan finally asks why he wants Katherine's crystal and Damon reveals his secret; he wants to bring Katherine back. Stefan is in shock and demands to know how he will do it. Damon explains that Katherine is not dead but buried in the tomb under the church. He asked Emily to save her by using magic and Emily agreed but asked him in return to protect her family. Damon kept his promise and now he wants Emily to keep her part of the deal. Emily used the crystal to reclaim power from a passing comet and the crystal regained its power when another comet passed over Mystic Falls (referring to episode 2) and now it's ready to be used again. Elena calls Stefan and tells him that Emily possessed Bonnie's body and she is going to Fell's church. Damon overhears it and heads there immediately. He encounters Emily who tells him that she can't keep her promise because things are different now. Damon tries to attack her but she throws him away and impales him on a tree using her witch power. Stefan finds Damon and helps him. Emily is working on a spell and tells Stefan that she cannot bring Katherine back because the other 26 vampires who \\"died\\" that same day will come back as well, something that Damon forgot to tell him earlier. Stefan tries to tell Damon that he can't do that but he is not listening; he wants Katherine back and also revenge on the people of Mystic Falls for hunting them down. Emily finishes the spell by throwing the crystal up in the air and it explodes. Emily leaves Bonnie's body and Damon, who is mad at Emily, attacks Bonnie. Stefan pulls him back and saves Bonnie by giving her his blood. Damon is devastated because his only shot to bring Katherine back is gone and he tells Stefan that Katherine never compelled him, that he knew everything from the beginning and he really loved her. Bonnie does not understand what happened and Elena promises to explain everything and she informs Stefan that she will tell Bonnie the truth. She also tells him that she now she knows she can be with him but Stefan breaks up with her and tells her that he will leave Mystic Falls. The episode ends with Logan (Chris Johnson) knocking on Jenna's door. Jenna opens the door and Logan asks her if she will invite him in.

History The site has been used as an aviation hub since the 1920s. New buildings and a concrete runway were built in an expansion that took place in 1951. It became an asset of the Jordanian government on 31 May 1957 and sat unused for a year. It was renamed King Hussein Air Base in June 1959, with No.1 Fighter Squadron (Hunters) and later No.2 Squadron (Vampires) of the Royal Jordanian Air Force moving from Amman. One of the hangars, some aircraft, and a runway were destroyed in the Six-Day War (1967).King Hussein Air College ‚Äì Mafraq Since 1978 it has been named King Hussein Air College. It is home to the Flying School, the Staff School, the Junior Command, and Number 2, 4, 5, and 11 Squadrons. The Mafraq-based KHAC is the oldest air base in Jordan, dating back to 1920, and, later in the century, the one and only flight training facility. Every aviator in the RJAF has been to this College, which graduated the first batch of Aviators back in 1975. The College now houses a university college that offers a bachelor degree in Aviation Sciences, all under the umbrella of Firas Al-Ajlouni School, named after a hero who fell martyr in the same base in 1967. The base is home to three training squadrons: 4th for basic training on fixed-wing aircraft, 11th for advanced fixed-wing training and 5th for helicopter training. Also among the components of the base is the Flying Instructor School, which trains trainers, a technical school for non-commissioned officers where they are taught technical management and English language course. The latter graduates six classes a year. A ground defense battalion, including a quick response platoon, and housing units for 80 families of the base's personnel also exist in the base, among other facilities. The organizational structure of the college includes a commandant, a flight wing commander, squadron commanders and a maintenance chief, while a crew of other top officers report to the commandant, handling security, finance, technical support, administrative affairs, logistics and housing. Before it was dedicated as a full-fledged training and education facility, KHAC was a combat base that took part in all wars the Kingdom had fought. In the 1920s Mafraq was used as a base for aircraft and armored cars of the RAF. By 1931 Mafraq, which is situated on a large flat desert expand 8km from the Syrian border, was used as the major staging and refueling post for international flights and for the transfer of air supplies, personnel, freight and mail. In 1951 the station was being rapidly developed with new buildings and a concrete runway. RAF Mafraq was evacuated and handed over to the Jordanian Government on May 31, 1957. The base stayed unused until 1958 when the RJAF took over and it was named King Hussein Air Base in June 1959 with 1st Fighter Squadron (Hunters) and later 2nd Squadron (Vampires) moving there from Amman. Flying training started in 1960 with the 4th Squadron equipped with Chipmunks, but was later disbanded. The base was attacked in the 1967 War with aircraft, runway and one of the hangers destroyed. It was then temporarily repaired but not used on a regular basis as the pilots were stationed in Iraq until 1968. In 1969, it was decided to complete the renovation so the Hunter squadron redeployed to Amman and then to Syria. Full local pilot training started at the base in 1974 and the first graduation was in 1975. In 1978, it was named King Hussein Air College, housing the Flying School with 2nd, 4th, 5th and 11th Squadrons, the Junior Command and Staff School, which was formed in 1979, and the Air Command and Staff College, formed in 1990 and later disbanded.https://www.rjaf.mil.jo/en/page-32.html The first class of female cadets will graduate in 2020.

Biography  Mr. An Ti-sheng was born at Xianghe County, Metropolitan District in 1868. He received his Chinese education in the old Confucian school. As a young boy, he showed artistic ability. In 1902, Mr. An was made the clerk of the Hanlin Academy and in 1904 he became an expectant magistrate in the Metropolitan District. He constantly devoted his time and energy to the study of the fine arts and among his accomplishments was the invention of Pao Hua silver enamel ware which is well- known today. In 1905, Mr. An became the director of the Commercial Exhibit Hall established by the Board of Commerce and was made a member of the Peking Chamber of Commerce. In the summer of 1910, a National Exhibition was held in Nanking, and Mr. An was a member of the Executive committee. In October 1911, he was a member of the Chinese Industrial Party which toured Japan. In 1912, the year of the Republic, the Peking government called a national conference to discuss industrial and commercial affairs of the country. Mr. An, as representative of the Metropolitan General Chamber of Commerce, attended the Conference which resulted in the founding of the National Association of the Chambers of Commerce which held its first conference in Peking in 1914. Mr. An represented the Metropolitan General Chamber of Commerce and was subsequently elected general secretary of the Association's Peking office. Since the establishment of the Directorate General of the Metropolitan Municipal Affairs, after the establishment of the Republic, Mr. An served as a member of the committee on Municipal Affairs. In 1914, he held the position of vice- president of the Panama Exhibition Commission in Peking. In February 1918, Mr. An was elected president of the Metropolitan General Chamber of Commerce and in August 1918 he was elected a member of the Shun-Chih (Metropolitan and Chihli) Provincial Assembly. In December 1918 he played an important part in the association for the Promotion of Internal Peace, being Chief-in-Charge of the General Affairs Department. In May 1919, when public sentiment against the pro-Japanese Anfu party developed into a nationwide boycott of Japanese goods, Mr. An acted as leader of the industrial and commercial interests participating. In 1922, he represented the Metropolitan District at the Customs Tariff Revision Conference in Shanghai. The Pao Hua silver enamel ware invented by Mr. An has largely supplanted Japanese cloisonne in Peking. At present Japanese cloisonne has practically disappeared from the Peking market. There are now in Peking a large number of Poa Hua Silver Enamel Ware factories most of which were founded by the inventor himself. In October 1935, he plotted and anticipated in the Xianghe Incident to gain the independence of Xianghe, which is considered to be part of the hyperaggressive Japanese's plan. He became the head of Xiangge Country, but step down 7 days later. An lived for 80 years but died before the People's Republic of China was founded.  Awards  President Feng Kuo-chang conferred upon Mr. An the Fifth Order of Chiaho in May 1919; President Hsu Shih-chang. the Fourth Order of Chiaho in January 1920 and the Third Order of Chiaho in February 1922; and President Li Yuan-hung, the Second Order of Chiaho in March 1923. Besides, Mr. An has received the Second Class Medal of the Ministry of Finance which he has helped to tide over many financial crises in Peking. He also has received the Second Class Medal of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to which department he has been an Advisor for several years; and that of the Second Class Medal of the Ministry of Justice to which he has rendered assistance in the improvement of industrial establishments in connection with the Peking penitentiaries.

The grandson of Aaron Jones, Jones played for several clubs in The Football League during his career, including Bradford Park Avenue, Southampton, and Cardiff City. He played primarily as a full-back. Playing career Originally from Yorkshire, Jones began his career as a forward for the team of Monckton Colliery, where he was an apprentice electrician at the time; he later converted to a full-back and, despite interest from Arsenal, Aston Villa, and Coventry City, joined Bradford Park Avenue in September 1961 at the age of 16. Making over 100 appearances for the team as a teenager, Jones was dubbed by then-manager Jimmy Scoular as \\"the best full-back in the Fourth Division\\". Jones's performances at Bradford Park Avenue attracted the attention of Southampton manager Ted Bates, who brought him to the club in June 1965, paying ¬£15,000 for the defender. He made his debut for the club in September against Coventry City, but despite being able to play on either the left or the right of defence he struggled to cement a place in the team due to the competition provided by Stuart Williams, Tommy Hare, and David Webb. He made seven appearances at right-back in the 1965‚Äì66 season, which saw the Saints promoted to the First Division. In his first season in the top flight, Jones made a total of 19 appearances, most of which were at left-back. In his remaining seasons at Southampton, Jones continued to struggle with securing a place in the regular starting lineup, as Joe Kirkup and Bob McCarthy added more competition to his regular positions, and at the end of the 1970‚Äì71 season he left the club after Bates failed to inform him about interest from other clubs. After leaving the Saints, Jones rejoined old manager Scoular at Cardiff City for ¬£6,000, but a string of injuries meant he only made a handful of appearances, after which he was released by the club. The final, non-league clubs he played for were Bath City and Basingstoke Town, and he briefly worked as a coach at Olivers Battery.

It was created after the death of Queen Victoria and given to the town by Colonel William Windle Pilkington, mayor of St Helens in 1902, and a member of the Pilkington glass manufacturers in the town. Pilkington commissioned George Frampton to design it. Frampton used the same model for the figure of the queen for two other statues, but placed it on thrones and pedestals of different designs. The St Helens statue was unveiled by the Earl of Derby in 1905. Originally placed in the centre of Victoria Square, it was moved to a position on the west side of the square in 2000. The statue is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History Colonel William Windle Pilkington (1839‚Äì1914) was mayor of St Helens in 1902, the year of the Coronation of King Edward VII. Pilkington was the eldest son of Richard Pilkington, who had founded the Pilkington Brothers Glassworks in the town, and he was the technical director and chairman of the company. In order to celebrate his mayoralty, and to recognise the benefits the town had received during the life of Queen Victoria, who had died the previous year, Pilkington offered to give a statue of the queen to the town. He commissioned George Frampton to design it. Frampton had previously been commissioned during the lifetime of the queen in 1898 by the Queen Empress Commemoration Fund to create a statue for Calcutta (now Kolkata) in India. This depicted Queen Victoria sitting on a throne, a concept inspired by the statue of the queen by Alfred Gilbert in 1887 for Winchester Castle. When Frampton's statue was unveiled in Calcutta by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, he told Frampton that no future copies should be made of the statue. However, Frampton used the same idea, that of an enthroned queen, for Pilkington's commission, and he used the same model for casting statues in Leeds and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, placing the statues on thrones and pedestals of differing designs. The architects employed for the statue were Briggs and Wolstenholme of Liverpool, and it was built by W. Thornton and Son, also of Liverpool. The statue was unveiled on 15 April 1905 by the Earl of Derby. The statue was originally placed against the Gamble Institute (a technical institute), but in 1910, with the agreement of Colonel Pilkington and Frampton, it was turned through 90 degrees to face the Town Hall. In 2000 the statue was restored by the National Conservation Centre in Liverpool, and then replaced in a different position on the west side of Victoria Square. Description Figure of Queen Victoria The statue consists of a figure in bronze on a base of granite and a pedestal of sandstone. The figure is about high and the base and pedestal together are about in height. Queen Victoria sits on a throne, with the sceptre resting on her right forearm, and holding an orb in her left hand. The orb is decorated with a rose, to represent Lancashire. The queen is wearing a brocade dress with a sash, and a cloak. Her feet are resting on a cushion. The throne is in Arts and Crafts style. Behind the queen's head is a laurel wreath, giving the appearance of a halo. Flanking the throne are two pillars, each surmounted by a capital in the form of attenuated oak trees. On top of the capitals are finials with carved harps on the fronts, to signify Ireland, and on the backs are lions rampart for Scotland. On the back of the throne is a statue of Saint George in armour, representing England. Supporting the statue is a base and a pedestal, both square with canted angles, on a hexagonal step. On the pedestal is a bronze plaque inscribed: and on the base is a plaque reading: Appraisal The memorial was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 12 December 1984.

Rhodesia, now divided between Zambia and Zimbabwe, first issued revenue stamps in 1890, and Zimbabwe continues to do so to this day. British South Africa Company The British South Africa Company issued revenue stamps for use in all of Rhodesia from 1890 to 1909. The first issue had four values from ¬£1 to ¬£10 and they bore the company's coat of arm. These were technically valid for postage but due to their high values they never actually saw postal use so they are regarded by many as purely revenue stamps. In 1896, some of these were surcharged with values between ¬£50 and ¬£200. These are incredibly rare as few were printed. Later in 1896, a new square design still featuring the coat of arms but with a more ornate frame was issued. This was replaced in 1898 with a design similar to the original 1890 issue but with some differences in the stamp's border. This set included a ¬£100 cherry red value, which is very rare and only six copies of the stamp are known to exist. Around 1907, some if these stamps were overprinted REVENUE to prevent them from any postal use, and in 1909 the ¬£1 to ¬£5 values were overprinted RHODESIA when this became the official name. These continued to be used until the 1920s. Around 1905, a set of cigarette excise stamps were issued, and these are rare as they were usually torn upon use. Southern Rhodesia Southern Rhodesian postage and revenue stamps fiscally used on a cheque in 1940. Southern Rhodesia became a separate colony in 1923, and in 1924 its first revenues portraying King George V in a military uniform were issued. These were replaced by a new issue showing an elderly King George in 1930. Following his death, in 1937 a set showing the new monarch King George VI was issued. This had nine values from 3/- to ¬£50. The rarest value is the 7/6 black as it was withdrawn soon after issue, and genuinely used stamps can now fetch over ¬£3000. In 1954, a large set showing the coat of arms was issued with values ranging from 1d to ¬£50. In the 1930s, long design excise stamps were used to pay cigarette taxes. From around 1937 to the 1940s, various postage stamps were EXCISE or E for the same purpose. Between 1961 and 1964 various stamps were issued for Personal Tax. These exist with various roulettes, perforations and combinations of both. Southern Rhodesia joined the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and used its revenue stamps from 1953 to 1963. Rhodesia Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in November 1965, the country became independent and issued its first revenues a year later. They used the 1954 Southern Rhodesia design but with altered inscriptions. One of the values - the 6d red and black - is very rare despite it being one of the most commonly used rates as it was the stamp duty tax on cheques. Its rarity is probably because old stocks of Southern Rhodesian revenues continued to be used instead of it. In 1970 the set was reissued denominated in Rhodesian dollars. There were some provisional surcharges made in 1980 just before the country was renamed Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Modern Zimbabwean revenues in blocks of four In 1980, Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe following the end of the civil war. Initially it used Rhodesian revenues with the name obliterated by hand in ink, but in 1981 a new design showing the Zimbabwe Bird was issued. Since around 2000 perforated stamps were withdrawn and replaced by rouletted issues on coloured paper. Due to inflation, these have values up to $200,000. Northern Rhodesia Northern Rhodesia became a separate protectorate in 1924, and it issued its first revenue stamps a year later with values from ¬£2 to ¬£50. These portrayed King George V and showed a local scene with giraffes, elephants and other wildlife. These continued to be used until the 1950s. Postage stamps were used for revenue transactions of lower values. In 1953, Queen Elizabeth II postage stamps were overprinted with a large R indicating revenue use. About two years later, the 1925 King George V design was reissued with the portrait of the Queen, this time with values ranging from 1d to ¬£50. In the 1930s, various cigarette excise stamps were also issued, and an employment stamp featuring the coat of arms was issued around 1962. Northern Rhodesia joined the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and used its revenue stamps from 1953 to 1963. Zambia Following the dissolution of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1963, Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia in 1964. Its first revenues were issued in 1964 and depicted the coat of arms. The design was reissued in 1968 denominated in the Zambian kwacha.

A second edition was printed in 1864. One source describes it as the \\"oldest map in Korea\\". Daedongyeojido is considered very advanced for its time, and marks the zenith of pre-modern Korean cartography. Description \\"Daedongyeojido\\" (1861) Ulleungdo and Usan The map consists of 22 separate, foldable booklets, each covering approximately (north-south) by (east‚Äìwest). Combined, they form a map of Korea that is wide and long. The scale of the map is 1:162,000. The map was printed from 70 basswood woodblocks, engraved on both sides. The techniques to create the map have been described as a hybrid of Korean and Western methods. The map is praised for precise delineations of mountain ridges, waterways, and transportation routes. It also has markings for settlements, including villages, as well as notable administrative and cultural areas and sites, such as past and present government offices and military sites, public warehouses, government horse ranches, beacon fire mounds, and royal tombs. Several versions of the map exist, with some variations (such as the number of booklets, either 21 or 22). The map was accompanied by a preface explaining the methodology, and a legend, as well as additional statistics, and a separate map for the Korean capital of Seoul. 100,000-won banknote controversy In 2008 the map was considered as an image for one of the 100,000-won banknotes, which would have been the highest-denomination South Korean banknote to date. However, the map of Daedongyeojido did not portray the internationally disputed Liancourt Rocks (known as Dokdo islands in Korea), and the ensuing public debate in Korea over whether the map on a banknote should be changed to include them made the image too controversial for such a high-visibility placement. Eventually, the 100,000-won banknote was cancelled due to the controversy stirred by the issue.

It was designed by Ferdinand Porsche in 1941 and produced by ≈†koda in Mlad√° Boleslav. Around 206 vehicles were produced between the years 1942‚Äì1944.  History  The idea of a heavy multipurpose tractor, intended for the prepared invasion of the Soviet Union supposedly came from Adolf Hitler. In 1941 Ferdinand Porsche prepared a design of a four-wheel drive tractor, distinguished by its large diameter (1500 mm) steel cleated wheels. The vehicle was powered by Porsche's own design air-cooled, inline-four petrol engine of 6023 cc displacement. As a starter, a two-cylinder petrol engine (half of KdF-Wagen engine) was used.Spremo 1991, p. 114. Final development and production took place in the ≈†koda automobile plant in Mlad√° Boleslav, in what was then the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The RSO went through its first trials in 1942, but results were disappointing; high weight and narrow wheels caused high ground pressure, causing the tractor to get stuck easily even on relatively solid surface. On icy surfaces, the vehicle was almost impossible to steer. Fuel consumption was also unfavourably high. Production still went ahead despite these problems, with around 200 tractors produced during 1942‚Äì1944. Because of their faults, they were never deployed on the eastern front; instead they served in Normandy and the Netherlands. Some of them supposedly participated in the Battle of the Bulge.Spremo 1991, p. 115-116.Cedrych 2007, p. 265. No vehicles are known to have survived to the present day.Spremo 1991, p. 116.

Rowing career  Cryan started rowing as the River Shannon flowed by the outside of her back garden. She and three friends from school started rowing together as a coxless four. They rowed together but they gradually moved away leaving Cryan to scull alone. In 1974, she joined Carrick on Shannon Rowing club, one of Ireland's oldest rowing clubs. She was eleven times Irish Ladies Single Sculls Champion from the years 1976‚Äì1986 inclusive. Olympics Cryan competed at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where she was placed seventh in the single sculls event, and was the first woman to compete in Rowing for Ireland at the Olympic Games. Cryan was fifteen-tenths of a second away from reaching the final. Cryan attributed this to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott allowing her to score higher as she felt a lot of the stronger competitors in rowing did not participate due to the boycott. After the 1980 Olympics, Cryan started working harder on her training with more weights practice. In 1983, she started to train in the United States in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics. However due to constant ninth-place finishes at the World Rowing Championships, the Irish Amateur Rowing Union voted against her being allowed to represent Ireland at the Olympics again as it was felt she had had her chance and due to her refusal to move to Dublin to train. Despite this, Cryan's performance at the 1980 Olympics was voted by readers of the Leitrim Observer to have been County Leitrim's greatest sporting moment, beating out Leitrim GAA's 1994 Connacht Senior Football Championship victory and Breege Connolly.

Mitt premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2014. The film was released on Netflix on January 24, 2014. Background Director Greg Whiteley is an admirer of Mitt Romney's father George. He was further interested in filming Romney when he heard that Romney had attended a screening of his film New York Doll and was planning to run for president. Whiteley then approached Tagg Romney about making a documentary about his father's presidential bid. Mitt Romney was at first resistant to the idea of a documentary, but his wife Ann liked the idea. Although Whiteley had initially planned to only cover the 2008 election, he eventually ended up filming over a period of six years. Synopsis In 2006, Mitt Romney decides to run for president of the United States. During the 2008 Republican presidential primaries, he seeks to win debates against John McCain and the other Republican Party presidential candidates. After he loses the Republican nomination, he returns in 2012 to challenge incumbent Barack Obama for the White House. Meanwhile, his wife is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and he worries about disappointing his supporters and family if he loses. Reception Mitt received mainly positive reviews from critics.

The memorial consists of figures and a frieze in bronze on a plinth and pedestal of Portland stone. The sculptor was George Frampton, and the architect working with him was Leonard Stokes. The figure on the top of the pedestal is that of Queen Victoria sitting on a throne, with a sceptre resting on her right forearm, and holding an orb in her left hand. The back of the throne has the appearance of a radiant Sun. On the sides of the pedestal are figures in niches, that on the left representing Peace, and that on the right representing Industry. On the front of the plinth are carved the Royal Arms, and on the back is the coat of arms of Leeds and an inscription. Beneath the pedestal is a plinth with a continuous frieze incorporating the words \\"INDIA\\", \\"AUSTRALIA\\", \\"CANADA\\", and \\"AFRICA\\" on scrolled plaques that are flanked by owls and foliage. The plinth stands on four steps. The memorial was unveiled on 27 November 1905, and originally stood outside Leeds Town Hall. It was moved to Woodhouse Moor in 1937.

Melanson started his musical career in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1953. Recipient of the ECMA Stompin' Tom Award, inducted into the Order of the Porcupine Hall of Fame, (Steve Fruitman, curator) the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in Nashville as an original Canadian Rockabilly, (Bob Timmers, curator), and the Nova Scotia Country Music Hall of Fame.  Career  Eddy was born in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on July 25, 1938. He started to play the guitar at age seven. When he was fourteen he sang in a minstrel show backed up by a lady playing a boogie woogie beat on the piano. He adapted the rhythm to his guitar, added a root to fifth riff and had the sound he would use for the next sixty years. Canadian Music Historian Steve Fruitman classified it as a reincarnation of the Country Jump Blues. He made his debut playing for the Halifax Colored Citizens improvement league in 1953. In 1955 Eddy joined the Halifax Civic Youth Dance Band playing guitar. After watching the 1956 release of the movie The Girl Can't Help It, he started his own band and called it Eddy M and the Rockabillys. Little did he know at the time that the term rockabilly would become a genre of music that would circle the globe. When Bill Haley and the Comets toured in the Maritimes in 1958 Eddy and his band was selected as the Canadian group to open for the Comets and play for the dance following the show. He also produced a live radio show with his band on CKBW in Bridgewater. In 1959 he produced his first home grown rock and roll show in the Halifax Forum featuring his Rockabillys, The Meteors, Art Sampson and his Rockets, the Lucky Four, the Rain Drops and from Kentville, Dutch Mason and the Esquires. At the end of the decade Eddy and his band played the Casa Loma in Montreal backing up the Folies Berge dancers for their twist presentation. The next move was to London, Ontario where he formed a new group called Eddy M and the Miracles. He toured in the United States, made personal appearances with Buddy Knox and the Fendermen and in 1963 recorded some of his songs at Starday Studios in Nashville to be released on the Sparton label in Canada. in 1965 Eddy and his wife Melva moved to Ontario where they bought some land and developed a private recreational complex complete with a recording studio, record label and a new band called Eddy M and the Memories. After releasing a single in 1982 he produced an album titled, 30 years of Eddy M. In 2003 he joined the broadcast team on CFBW, Hanover and in 2010 produced a CD to give out to folks wherever he played. He celebrated sixty years in the business in 2013.

The 21-hour-long conflict pitted the Clusterfuck Coalition and Russian alliances (CFC/Rus) against the N3 and Pandemic Legion (N3/PL), and involved over 7,548 player characters with a maximum of 2,670 players in the B-R5RB system at one time. The in-game cost of the losses totalled over 11 trillion Interstellar Kredit (ISK), an estimated theoretical real-world value of $300,000 to $330,000 USD derived from the value of PLEX, an item purchasable with real currency that can be redeemed either for subscription time or traded for in-game currency. Part of a larger conflict known as the Halloween War, the fight started after a single player controlling a space station in the N3/PL-controlled star system B-R5RB accidentally failed to make a scheduled in-game routine maintenance payment, which made the star system open to capture. Being a key staging area used by N3/PL in the war, the CFC and Russian coalitions began pouring players into the system in a swift offensive, and N3/PL moved in a large fleet of players as a response as well. A massive battle erupted in the system, and numerous smaller engagements occurred throughout the game universe as players attempted to block reinforcements from joining the battle. CFC/Rus gained a clear win by inflicting heavy losses on N3/PL and successfully capturing B-R5RB. The losses totalled 576 capital ships including 75 Titans (the largest ships available to players), along with thousands of smaller vessels. To commemorate the sheer size and cost of the battle, the game's creators, CCP Games, erected a permanent monument in the system B-R5RB named \\"The Titanomachy\\", consisting of non-salvageable capital ship wrecks. Background Eve Online is an MMORPG space game in which players engage in a variety of activities including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat. Players may form corporations (clans, guilds or alliances in other video games), and these corporations in turn can formally join in alliance with other corporations. Many of these alliances create informal coalitions to work toward common goals and fight competing alliances. Despite the prevalence of coalitions in the game, there is no formal in-game mechanic providing for these \\"super-alliances\\". The Halloween War was a conflict in the game universe which started around Halloween in late October 2013 and pitted the CFC and \\"Russian\\" coalition and their allies against the N3 and Pandemic Legion coalitions and their allies. B-R5RB, located in the Immensea region, served as the staging ground for all Pandemic Legion fleets. A few days before the fighting in B-R5RB, the CFC and Russian coalition suffered a decisive loss to N3 and Pandemic Legion forces in the Battle of HED-GP in the Catch region, due to the N3/PL's \\"Wrecking Ball\\" formation of Titan and Supercarrier \\"supercapital\\" ships in the center of a huge sphere of mainly Archon-class carriers (one of the most popular and effective types at the time). Battle=Outbreak of conflict On January 27, 2014 (YC 116 in-game), the one-year anniversary of the immense Battle of Asakai, player corporation , a member of Nulli Secunda, which in turn is a part of the N3/Pandemic Legion coalition, mistakenly failed to make a scheduled payment to in-game security force CONCORD. (Manfred Sideous of Pandemic Legion claimed that the missed payment resulted from a bug, as he had enough ISK in his holding corporation wallet and had autopay checked.) This failed payment resulted in the star system B-R5RB losing its sovereign status, which meant that other players could capture the system without needing to wait for the normal \\"reinforcement timers\\" (real time waiting periods of several days designed to allow defenders to rally). An enemy scout discovered Nulli Secunda quietly attempting to regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU in order to establish control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets. Battle for B-R5RB Pandemic Legion and N3 moved to retake the system, but the Russians destroyed all Territorial Control Units anchored in the system. N3/PL then deployed their super-carrier and carrier fleet in the \\"Wrecking Ball\\" formation just off the system's space station, a formation which had previously defeated the CFC and Russian alliance. As the conflict was a surprise and occurred on a Monday workday, CFC and Rus decided to take advantage and gain field superiority before N3 and PL could respond and so deployed their entire capital fleet to the system. Meanwhile, they deployed their sub-capital fleets to N3 staging systems, including I-NGI8 and GXK-7F, to delay any reinforcements. Each side then attempted to rush all available pilots into the system, and the game's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation is a game feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the game lagging or disconnecting players. In time dilation, the game slows to ten percent normal speed, with each second of game time displaying as ten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every hour, when their Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles, making extraction difficult. For a while neither side gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on- line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead in the number of enemy Titans destroyed. Throughout the engagement, related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements, destroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray. The tide of the battle started to turn when Manfred Sideous, the initial N3/PL fleet commander, handed control to Vince Draken, CEO of Northern Coalition. Vince Draken managed to concentrate fire on and destroy several CFC/Rus Titans, and forced some additional Russian Titans to leave the system with depleted shields and armor. However, N3/PL overestimated their success and began to focus their attacks on the Titan belonging to Sort Dragon, the commander of all remaining Russian forces in the field. This Titan had very high damage resistance, and Sort Dragon drew upon his entire fleet to assist in repairing it, enabling it to hold out much longer than most other Titans up to that point. By the time his Titan fell, the CFC/Rus had managed to destroy five N3/PL Titans, putting the alliance well ahead. James Carl, a member of the N3/Pandemic Legion coalition, reported to the Associated Press that \\"It looks like CFC is winning, but we're hoping now that all of our US players are online, we'll turn the tide\\". But when the US time zone players logged on and reinforcements became available, PL did not see the numbers they had expected, and the CFC blockaded adjacent systems to prevent them joining the battle. Eventually, N3/PL could no longer destroy any Titans, and ordered a retreat. They switched their fire onto CFC/Rus's Dreadnoughts in an attempt to take out as many ships as possible during retreat. Due to their spy network under Intelligence Commander Tobias Deidorm, CFC knew that N3/PL had ordered a retreat and deployed Interdictors and Heavy Interdictors to prevent the withdrawal. N3/PL lost several more Titans, Super Carriers, and Capitals in the extraction, with many trapped by the warp disruption bubbles strewn throughout the battle area. The battle definitively ended when the Eve universe went offline for its regular daily maintenance at 11:00 UTC on January 28, disconnecting all players. Aftermath Over 7,548 unique characters participated in the overall battle, of which 6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with a maximum of 2,670 in system at the same time. These numbers included 717 unique player corporations and involved 55 unique player alliances. Joystiq called the battle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date. The 21-hour-long conflict resulted in the loss of 75 Titans, 13 supercarriers, 370 Dreadnoughts, and 123 Carriers, along with thousands of smaller ships and innumerable fighters and drones. N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59 Titans, while the CFC and Russian coalition lost only 16. An estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle, and media outlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Online's history, estimating that the battle cost US$300,000‚Äì330,000 in real- world money. This estimate comes from a figure listed in the official report by CCP Games, which the report based on a theoretical conversion of pilot license extensions, or PLEX, into real-world USD. While direct conversion of real currency into ISK, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited, and PLEX units are purchasable in-game, additional PLEX units can be purchased for US$20, and it is from this theoretical real-world value that the estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn. However, this does not mean this amount of real- world money was expended, as many ships were purchased through in-game currency or corporation assets. Eyj√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson, an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Online's economy, stated that \\"To me, as an economist, that doesn't really matter. In both cases this is economical value that is created by people's work, either in real life or in virtual life. They put their blood, sweat and tears into making stuff so they can have an advantage in a battle, because in this battle like in any other battle in meat worlds, in real life, it is the resources you have available.\\" Alexander Gianturco, who goes by the in-game character The Mittani, CEO of Goonwaffe (the largest corporation in the Goonswarm Federation alliance and hence the largest alliance in the CFC), reported to Polygon near the end of the battle that \\"As vengeance for [the battle of Asakai] goes, it's somewhat ironic; our forces lost three Titans and seven supercarriers last year in Asakai, and lost the battle. This year we've killed 40+ hostile Titans and we have seven more hours of killing before downtime\\". Also near the end of the battle, Ali Aras wrote on TheMittani.com, an EVE Online-devoted website, that the \\"kills made here decide not only this war, but the next, and the next after that\\". He also highlighted some of the economic repercussions, including the increase in the price of Tritanium, which he viewed as an upshot of \\"the flurry of industrial production to come\\". Following the Battle of B-R5RB, Pandemic Legion withdrew from the Southeast theater and formed an agreement with the CFC which allowed them to evacuate billions of assets from the B-R5RB system. Other N3 forces retreated in from the south, and in the following few days CFC alliances managed to capture a total of 23 systems in the regions Immensea, Catch, Tenerifis, and Feythabolis from N3/Pandemic Legion alliances. The CFC then withdrew from the southeast theater. In the weeks after, the Russian bloc suffered internal troubles, allowing N3 to regain all of the territory lost after B-R5RB and conquer most of the Russian bloc's territory. In the longer term, B-R5RB established CFC, later re-branded as The Imperium, as the predominant superpower in EVE Online, with little serious resistance challenging the coalition for the next two years. Due to the media attention given to the battle, it, like Asakai the year before, inspired thousands of people to join the game. In the 30 days after B-R5RB, new player subscriptions increased 10 percent (although most players quit after one month of gameplay). This resulted in a minimum of $50,000 USD in additional revenue for CCP Games. Scale The total number of players in the B-R5RB system peaked at 2,670, which was less than the previously largest battle in Eve at 6VDT-H, which had 4,070 players in the main battle. B-R5RB however had many smaller related battles playing out, meaning it involved more players in total. The number of players was later surpassed by the battle of 9-4RP2, with over 6,000 players in system and many more in related battles. However, due to technical issues with the larger battle, B-R5RB remains the largest battle in the EVE Online universe in terms of resources destroyed. Commemoration Once the game went into downtime, developer CCP Games announced that it would create an in-game monument in the B-R5RB star system to commemorate the battle. \\"Titanomachy\\" was created using brand-new Titan wreck models introduced with EVE Online: Rubicon's 1.1 release which came out immediately following the battle. The name references both the Titan-class ships used in the game and the war in Greek mythology between the Titans and the Olympian gods. CCP Games posted on the EVE Online website that they planned to install \\"Titanomachy\\" during downtime of January 31, and were \\"hard at work placing the wrecks in a hauntingly beautiful arrangement\\". Placed around the seventh planet in the B-R5RB system, the installation is \\"off grid\\" from the space station. CCP Games stated that \\"Thereafter, any player who plays [Eve Online] can make the dangerous pilgrimage there and marvel at the scope of destruction. We expect some of the 'travel' bloggers to do full write-ups on it almost immediately and [Eve Online] videographers to make some moving tributes as well.\\" The history of the battle and the installed memorial has been called a \\"must-see\\" for players as well as the general public who might otherwise not be interested in the game.

Synopsis During the Boer War, Private Doubleday saves the life of Major Pyke. Pyke recommends that he be awarded a Victoria Cross but the Private is instead sent to prison when his past crimes are discovered. Pyke therefore decides to raise Doubleday's son as his own. Many years later the younger Doubleday has grown to be a master criminal who has never been caught by the police, but whose plans for a major job are ruined by the interference of his ex-convict father. Cast * Tom Walls as Doubleday * Ralph Lynn as Major Pyke * Veronica Rose as Phyllis Chisholm * Joan Marion as Clare Chester * Hubert Harben as Mr. Gallop * Henry B.

Williams as Hiccuping Judge Critical reception The Radio Times wrote, \\"this Ben Travers comedy keeps promising to burst into life, but is eventually snuffed out by the endless round of deceptions and misunderstandings that were the trademark of his celebrated Aldwych productions. Expert farceurs Tom Walls and Ralph Lynn are as happy as sandboys in their dual roles but, while Walls plays father and son with the customary glint in his eye, Lynn fails to bring the same vim to the part of a Boer War veteran as he does to his shady, silly-ass grandson\\"; whereas Sky Movies was more positive, writing, \\"Ben Travers contributes a clever screenplay with a sweetly-turned ending, and Walls (who also directed) and Lynn do first-class work\\"; and TV Guide called it \\"One of Walls and Lynn's better British comedies.\\" Writing for The Spectator in 1937, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, voicing his appreciation that the film brings viewers back to the elaborate and almost universal roguery in the tradition of The English Rogue and Moll Flanders. Greene praised the acting of both Walls and Lynn who play multiple characters throughout the film, and stated that his only complaint was that it was \\"a little marred by an inability to remain wholly flippant.\\" (reprinted in: ) ReferencesBibliography * Low, Rachael.

Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (for e.g. frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM), e.g. for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps. Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark. On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers. Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler targets Java 6 by default, but lets the programmer choose to target Java 8 up to 13, for optimization, or more features.  History  In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, a new language for the JVM, which had been under development for a year. JetBrains lead Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compilation time of Scala as a deficiency. One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java. In February 2012, JetBrains open sourced the project under the Apache 2 license. The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. Andrey Breslav mentioned that the team decided to name it after an island just like Java was named after the Indonesian island of Java (though the programming language Java was perhaps named after the coffee). JetBrains hopes that the new language will drive IntelliJ IDEA sales. Kotlin v1.0 was released on 15 February 2016. This is considered to be the first officially stable release and JetBrains has committed to long-term backwards compatibility starting with this version. At Google I/O 2017, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android. Kotlin v1.2 was released on 28 November 2017. Sharing code between JVM and JavaScript platforms feature was newly added to this release (as of version 1.4 multiplatform programming is an alpha feature upgraded from \\"experimental\\"). Full-stack demo has been made with the new Kotlin/JS Gradle Plugin. Kotlin v1.3 was released on 29 October 2018, bringing coroutines for asynchronous programming. On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers. Kotlin v1.4 was released in August 2020, with e.g. some slight changes to the support for Apple's platforms, i.e. to the Objective-C/Swift interop.  Design  Development lead Andrey Breslav has said that Kotlin is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and a \\"better language\\" than Java, but still be fully interoperable with Java code, allowing companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin. Semicolons are optional as a statement terminator; in most cases a newline is sufficient for the compiler to deduce that the statement has ended. Kotlin variable declarations and parameter lists have the data type come after the variable name (and with a colon separator), similar to BASIC, Pascal and TypeScript. Variables in Kotlin can be read-only, declared with the keyword, or mutable, declared with the keyword. Class members are public by default, and classes themselves are final by default, meaning that creating a derived class is disabled unless the base class is declared with the keyword. In addition to the classes and member functions (equivalent to methods) of object-oriented programming, Kotlin also supports procedural programming with the use of functions. Kotlin functions (and constructors) support default arguments, variable-length argument lists, named arguments and overloading by unique signature. Class member functions are virtual, i.e. dispatched based on the runtime type of the object they are called on. Kotlin 1.3 adds (experimental) support for contracts (inspired by Eiffel's design by contract programming paradigm)  Syntax = Procedural programming style  Kotlin relaxes Java's restriction of allowing static methods and variables to exist only within a class body. Static objects and functions can be defined at the top level of the package without needing a redundant class level. For compatibility with Java, Kotlin provides a \`JvmName\` annotation which specifies a class name used when the package is viewed from a Java project. For example, \`@file:JvmName(\\"JavaClassName\\")\`. Main entry point As in C, C++, C#, Java, and Go, the entry point to a Kotlin program is a function named \\"main\\", which may be passed an array containing any command-line arguments. (This is optional since Kotlin 1.3). Perl and Unix shell style string interpolation is supported. Type inference is also supported. // Hello, World! example fun main() { val scope = \\"World\\" println(\\"Hello, $scope!\\") } fun main(args: Array) { for (arg in args) { println(arg) } } Extension functions Similar to C#, Kotlin allows a user to add functions to any class without the formalities of creating a derived class with new functions. Instead, Kotlin adds the concept of an extension function which allows a function to be \\"glued\\" onto the public function list of any class without being formally placed inside of the class. In other words, an extension function is a helper function that has access to all the public interface of a class which it can use to create a new function interface to a target class and this function will appear exactly like a function of the class, appearing as part of code completion inspection of class functions. For example: package MyStringExtensions fun String.lastChar(): Char = get(length - 1) >>> println(\\"Kotlin\\".lastChar()) By placing the preceding code in the top-level of a package, the String class is extended to include a function that was not included in the original definition of the String class. // Overloading '+' operator using an extension function operator fun Point.plus(other: Point): Point { return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y) } >>> val p1 = Point(10, 20) >>> val p2 = Point(30, 40) >>> println(p1 + p2) Point(x=40, y=60) Unpack arguments with spread operator Similar to Python, the spread operator asterisk (*) unpacks an array's contents as comma-separated arguments to a function: fun main(args: Array) { val list = listOf(\\"args: \\", *args) println(list) }  Destructuring declarations  Destructuring declarations decompose an object into multiple variables at once, e.g. a 2D coordinate object might be destructured into two integers x and y. For example, the object supports destructuring to simplify access to its key and value fields: for ((key, value) in map) { println(\\"$key: $value\\") } Nested functions Kotlin allows local functions to be declared inside of other functions or methods. class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String) fun saveUserToDb(user: User) { fun validate(user: User, value: String, fieldName: String) { require(value.isNotEmpty()) { \\"Can't save user \${user.id}: empty $fieldName\\" } } validate(user, user.name, \\"Name\\") validate(user, user.address, \\"Address\\") // Save user to the database ... } Classes are final by default In Kotlin, to derive a new class from a base class type, the base class needs to be explicitly marked as \\"open\\". This is in contrast to most object-oriented languages such as Java where classes are open by default. Example of a base class that is open to deriving a new subclass from it. // open on the class means this class will allow derived classes open class MegaButton { // no-open on a function means that // polymorphic behavior disabled if function overridden in derived class fun disable() { ... } // open on a function means that // polymorphic behavior allowed if function is overridden in derived class open fun animate() { ... } } class GigaButton: MegaButton { // Explicit use of override keyword required to override a function in derived class override fun animate() { println(\\"Giga Click!\\") } } Abstract classes are open by default Abstract classes define abstract or \\"Pure Virtual\\" placeholder function that will be defined in a derived class. Abstract classes are open by default. // No need for the open keyword here, it‚Äôs already open by default abstract class Animated { // This virtual function is already open by default as well abstract fun animate() open fun stopAnimating() fun animateTwice() }  Classes are public by default Kotlin provides the following keywords to restrict visibility for top-level declaration, such as classes, and for class members: public, internal, protected, and private. When applied to a class member: public (default): Visible everywhere internal: Visible in a module protected: Visible in subclasses private: Visible in a class When applied to a top-level declaration public (default): Visible everywhere internal: Visible in a module private: Visible in a file Example: // Class is visible only to current module internal open class TalkativeButton : Focusable { // method is only visible to current class private fun yell() = println(\\"Hey!\\") // method is visible to current class and derived classes protected fun whisper() = println(\\"Let's talk!\\") }  Primary constructor vs. secondary constructors  Kotlin supports the specification of a \\"primary constructor\\" as part of the class definition itself, consisting of an argument list following the class name. This argument list supports an expanded syntax on Kotlin's standard function argument lists, that enables declaration of class properties in the primary constructor, including visibility, extensibility and mutability attributes. Additionally, when defining a subclass, properties in super- interfaces and super-classes can be overridden in the primary constructor. // Example of class using primary constructor syntax // (Only one constructor required for this class) open class PowerUser : User ( protected val nickname: String, final override var isSubscribed: Boolean = true) { ... } However, in cases where more than one constructor is needed for a class, a more general constructor can be used called secondary constructor syntax which closely resembles the constructor syntax used in most object-oriented languages like C++, C#, and Java. // Example of class using secondary constructor syntax // (more than one constructor required for this class) class MyButton : View { // Constructor #1 constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx) { // ... } // Constructor #2 constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attr) { // ... } }  Data Class  Kotlin provides Data Classes to define classes that store only properties. In Java programming, classes that store only properties are not unusual, but regular classes are used for this purpose. Kotlin has given provision to exclusively define classes that store properties alone. These data classes are not required to declare any methods, only properties. A data class does not typically contain a body, unlike a regular class. Default overrides for object methods such as \`equals()\` or \`toString()\` are generated during compilation. The \`data\` keyword is used before the \`class\` keyword to define a data class. fun main(args: Array) { // create a data class object like any other class object var book1 = Book(\\"Kotlin Programming\\", 250) println(book1) // output: Book(name=Kotlin Programming, price=250) } // data class with parameters and their optional default values data class Book(val name: String = \\"\\", val price: Int = 0) Kotlin interactive shell $ kotlinc-jvm type :help for help; :quit for quit >>> 2 + 2 4 >>> println(\\"Hello, World!\\") Hello, World! >>> Kotlin as a scripting language Kotlin can also be used as a scripting language. A script is a Kotlin source file (.kts) with top level executable code. // list_folders.kts import java.io.File val folders = File(args[0]).listFiles { file -> file.isDirectory() } folders?.forEach { folder -> println(folder) } Scripts can be run by passing the \`-script\` option and the corresponding script file to the compiler. $ kotlinc -script list_folders.kts \\"path_to_folder_to_inspect\\" Null Safety Kotlin makes a distinction between nullable and non-nullable data types. All nullable objects must be declared with a \\"?\\" postfix after the type name. Operations on nullable objects need special care from developers: null-check must be performed before using the value. Kotlin provides null-safe operators to help developers: * (safe navigation operator) can be used to safely access a method or property of a possibly null object. If the object is null, the method will not be called and the expression evaluates to null. * (null coalescing operator) often referred to as the Elvis operator: fun sayHello(maybe: String?, neverNull: Int) { // use of elvis operator val name: String = maybe ?: \\"stranger\\" println(\\"Hello $name\\") } An example of the use of the safe navigation operator: // returns null if... // - foo() returns null, // - or if foo() is non-null, but bar() returns null, // - or if foo() and bar() are non-null, but baz() returns null. // vice versa, return value is non-null if and only if foo(), bar() and baz() are non-null foo()?.bar()?.baz() Lambdas Kotlin provides support for higher order functions and anonymous functions or lambdas. // the following function takes a lambda, f, and executes f passing it the string, \\"lambda\\" // note that (s: String) -> Unit indicates a lambda with a String parameter and Unit return type fun executeLambda(f: (s: String) -> Unit) { f(\\"lambda\\") } Lambdas are declared using braces, . If a lambda takes parameters, they are declared within the braces and followed by the operator. // the following statement defines a lambda that takes a single parameter and passes it to the println function val l = { c : Any? -> println(c) } // lambdas with no parameters may simply be defined using val l2 = { print(\\"no parameters\\") } Complex \\"hello world\\" example fun main(args: Array) { greet { to.place }.print() } // Inline higher-order functions inline fun greet(s: () -> String) : String = greeting andAnother s() // Infix functions, extensions, type inference, nullable types, // lambda expressions, labeled this, Elvis operator (?:) infix fun String.andAnother(other : Any?) = buildString() { append(this@andAnother); append(\\" \\"); append(other ?: \\"\\") } // Immutable types, delegated properties, lazy initialization, string templates val greeting by lazy { val doubleEl: String = \\"ll\\"; \\"he\${doubleEl}o\\" } // Sealed classes, companion objects sealed class to { companion object { val place = \\"world\\"} } // Extensions, Unit fun String.print() = println(this) Tools * IntelliJ IDEA has plug-in support for Kotlin. IntelliJ IDEA 15 was the first version to bundle the Kotlin plugin in the IntelliJ Installer, and provide Kotlin support out of the box. * JetBrains also provides a plugin for Eclipse. * Integration with common Java build tools is supported including Apache Maven, Apache Ant, and Gradle. * Android Studio (based on IntelliJ IDEA) has official support for Kotlin, starting from Android Studio 3. * Emacs has a Kotlin Mode in its Melpa package repository. * Vim has a plugin maintained on Github. Applications Kotlin is widely used for Server Side, and Android development. On Android the platform was stuck on Java 7 for a while (with some contemporary language features made accessible through the use of Retrolambda or the Jack toolchain) and Kotlin introduces many improvements for programmers such as null-pointer safety, extension functions and infix notation. Accompanied by full Java compatibility and good IDE support (Android Studio) it is intended to improve code readability, give an easier way to extend Android SDK classes and speed up development. Kotlin was announced as an official Android development language at Google I/O 2017. It became the third language fully supported for Android, in addition to Java and C++. Spring officially added Kotlin support with version 5 on 04 January 2017 before the Android announcement made by Google at Google I/O 2017. Some of the official Kotlin support in Spring covers documentation, library support, and video presentations. Many of the other Server Side libraries/frameworks like Ktor, and Vert.x provide official Kotlin support. Google Cloud Platform officially supports Kotlin, however the other cloud platforms like AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Azure don't officially provide Kotlin support although Kotlin is known to run on these platforms. Kotlin is mainly used in new projects (96%), and is mostly used in work projects (75%), followed by personal projects (68%). The following types of software are developed using Kotlin: * Mobile (56%) * Web Backend (47%) * Library/framework (28%) * Tooling (20%) Linux is the top target used in Kotlin Native projects (74%), followed by Android (48%), and MacOS (47%). Adoption In 2018, Kotlin was the fastest growing language on GitHub with 2.6 times more developers compared to 2017. It's the fourth most loved programming language according to the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Kotlin was also awarded the O'Reilly Open Source Software Conference Breakout Award for 2019. Many companies/organisations have used Kotlin for backend development: * Google * Norwegian Tax Administration * Gradle * Amazon * Square * JetBrains * Flux * Allegro * OLX * Shazam * Pivotal * Rocket Travel * Meshcloud * Zalando Some companies/organisations have used Kotlin for web development: * JetBrains * Data2viz * Fritz2 * Barclay's Bank A number of companies have publicly stated using Kotlin: * DripStat * Basecamp * Pinterest * Coursera * Netflix * Uber * Square * Trello * Duolingo * Corda, a distributed ledger developed by a consortium of well-known banks (such as Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, UBS, HSBC, BNP Paribas, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale), has over 90% Kotlin in its codebase.

He is an ISI highly cited researcher,Highly Cited Researchers with last names beginning with C as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Geophysical Union. In December 2013, Chameides announced that he would be stepping down from his position at Duke the following June, saying that he \\"feels comfortable stepping down now given that he has accomplished many of his initial goals.\\" He was replaced by Alan Townsend on July 1, but remains a member of the Nicholas School faculty. Education and scientific career Chameides, a native of New York City, originally wanted to be a lawyer at the time he went to college. However, he later changed his major, first to physics and then to atmospheric science, as a result of taking an undergraduate physics course. He received a bachelor's degree from Binghamton University in 1970, a Master of philosophy degree from Yale University in 1973, and a PhD in 1974, also from Yale. He then began postdoctoral research at the University of Michigan, where he conducted research with Ralph J. Cicerone. After completing this research, he spent 25 years at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he eventually became the chairman of the department of atmospheric sciences. While an associate professor there, he was the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Geophysical Research from 1985 to 1989, and, five years later, was the lead author on a study in Science which reported that ozone from photochemical smog may significantly reduce global food production. In the study, Chameides et al. wrote that about 60% of smog is produced in North America, Europe, China, and Japan, which also produce about 60% of the global food supply. In 1998, Chameides was elected into the National Academy of Sciences, becoming the second Georgia Tech professor in the university's history to be so honored (the first was Mostafa El-Sayed in 1980). In 2005, he left Georgia Tech to become the chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a decision that Virginia Gewin referred to as \\"unorthodox.\\" Chameides said he made this decision because he wanted to \\"...do more to advance the cause of good environmental stewardship.\\" In 2011, Chameides was the vice-chair of a report issued by the United States National Research Council entitled \\"America's Climate Choices.\\" Public advocacy Chameides has been active in highlighting the dangers of global warming, and has testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Science, Space and Technology on the matter. In his testimony, delivered on April 25, 2013, he said that global warming is occurring, is primarily caused by human activity, and that it will have many negative effects on the United States, including, but not limited to, \\"more intense and frequent heat waves, risks to coastal communities from sea level rise, greater drying of the arid Southwest, and increased public health risks.\\" He currently runs a blog on the Nicholas School of the Environment website called \\"The Green Grok,\\"The Green Grok and has also blogged about global warming and other environmental issues on the Huffington Post and for Popular Science. Chameides has also written about the economics of climate change mitigation for both Science and for The Guardian. Additionally, after Joe Bastardi claimed on Fox News Channel that carbon dioxide can't cause global warming because of the first law of thermodynamics and Le Chatelier's principle, Media Matters for America contacted Chameides by email, who referred to Bastardi's claims as \\"utter nonsense.\\" He has also, along with Alan Leshner, criticized the North Carolina government's proposal of a law in response to a report stating that sea levels were projected to rise about 39 inches over the next century. In an article for the News & Observer, they accused the law's supporters of trying to \\"disregard projections of sea level rise\\" and trying to \\"outlaw climate change.\\" The law, which would prevent the government from using sea-level data based on anything except \\"historical data\\" for the next four years, was passed despite Chameides' objections. He has also criticized the cash for clunkers program by pointing out that, while one of its goals is to decrease CO2 emissions by promoting the purchase of more fuel-efficient cars, manufacturing new cars results in the production of carbon dioxide‚Äîhe puts the figure at between 3 and 12 tons per car. He has also calculated that trading in a clunker that gets 18 mpg for a new car that gets 22 mpg would necessitate 5 and a half years of typical driving to offset the car's carbon footprint. Chameides has also written about other environmental issues, like chemicals used in certain consumer products. For example, when interviewed by the Taipei Times about the safety of optical brighteners in laundry detergent, he said that scientific studies on the topic have been \\"inconclusive.\\" References Category:American atmospheric scientists Category:American environmentalists Category:Climate change environmentalists Category:Duke University faculty Category:Binghamton University alumni Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Yale University alumni Category:Scientists from New York City Category:Highly Cited Researchers Category:Fellows of the American Geophysical Union Category:1949 births Category:Living people ","title":"William L.

Biography Bogdan SuceavƒÉ was born in Curtea de Arge»ô, Romania, on September 27, 1969. Growing up, SuceavƒÉ spent his holidays with his maternal grandparents at Nuc»ôoara, a remote community that maintained its traditions, unbroken by the collectivisation elsewhere of Ceau»ôescu regime. There he absorbed Balkan folk-tales and myths, which would inform some of his literary works.\\"Author's Note\\" in SuceavƒÉ mentioned his maternal grandmother was a cousin of Elisabeta Rizea, a figure of Romanian anti-communist resistance. SuceavƒÉ attended the University of Bucharest, where he obtained his undergraduate and master's degree in mathematics. He then moved to the United States to study at the Michigan State University for his doctorate. His thesis, titled New Riemannian and K√§hlerian Curvature Invariants and Strongly Minimal Submanifolds, was written under the supervision of Bang-Yen Chen. Following his doctorate in 2002, SuceavƒÉ was hired by California State University, Fullerton. Career=Mathematics At the age of 13, SuceavƒÉ won a prize at the Romanian National Mathematical Olympiad, following which he was encouraged to pursue mathematics as a viable career. During his undergraduate years he studied mathematical analysis with Solomon Marcus and Ion ColojoarƒÉ, algebra with Constantin Vraciu and Constantin Ni»õƒÉ, geometry with Adriana Turtoi, Stere Ianu»ô, and Liviu Nicolescu, among others. At Michigan State University he took courses with Selman Akbulut, Bang-Yen Chen, John D. McCarthy, Thomas Parker, and Baisheng Yan, and others. SuceavƒÉ is a Professor of Mathematics at the California State University, Fullerton. He specialises in Differential geometry, the foundations of geometry, and the history of mathematics. SuceavƒÉ is active in the encouragement of mathematical research among young students in California. He has established a mathematics circle involving undergraduates, and extensively published in gazettes of mathematical problems aimed at high school students. His mathematical works appeared in Houston Journal of Mathematics, Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics, American Mathematical Monthly, Mathematical Intelligencer, Beitr√§ge zur Algebra und Geometrie, Differential Geometry and Its Applications, Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal, Publicationes Mathematicae, Results in Mathematics, Tsukuba Journal of Mathematics, Notices of the American Mathematical Society, Contemporary Mathematics, Historia Mathematica, and other mathematical journals.

She is now a maritime store at Aix-les-Bains, on the Lac du Bourget. Ship history L'Alm√©e is a yacht built in 1886 by the Chantiers de la Seine of Argenteuil for Henri Menier, a French chocolate-maker, who had drawn its plans. The ship was launched on May 10, 1887. On October 24, 1893, during an official visit to Paris, Counter admiral and baron Jean Th√©obald Lag√©, president of the Union des yachts fran√ßais, gave counter admiral Theodor Avellan, major of the Russian Squadron in the Mediterranean Sea, a diploma of honorary member of the Union and a commemorative gold medal on board the yacht. On September 6, 1913, Henri Menier died and his yacht was laid up on the Oise. The next year, World War I began and the L'Alm√©e was requisitioned by the Marine Nationale. It was used as a patrol boat until the end of the war when it came back to the Oise. It was bought by the Domaines de l'√âtat and moored on the Marne. In 1926, it was bought by the Compagnie de Navigation du Lac, jointly managed by Michel Clappier and F√©lix Bal, and brought to the Lac du Bourget. In 1929, Michel Clappier became the only manager of the company and F√©lix Bal created a competing company in 1930, the Soci√©t√© Nouvelle de Navigation ‚Äì Les cygnes du Lac. L'Alm√©e was then used as a barge to transport wood or was aground in Memard Bay (North West of Aix-les-Bains). During the Second World War, it stayed aground in this bay (located only some meters away from its current location). It was plundered during the conflict. At the end of the war, it was bought by the Soci√©t√© de l'√âtoile du Lac and transformed into a ferry-boat. It was renamed Hautecombe and, in 1947, it began its crossings between Aix-les-Bains and Hautecombe Abbey, alternating with the ferry La Savoie. The maritime store L'Alm√©e in April 2015. On August 18, 1969, the cruise ship La Fraidieu sunk near Ripaille Castle, then the ship Sainte- Odile capsized on August 7, 1970 near Yvoire. In total, the sinking of these ships killed 31 people; 24 in the first shipwreck and 7 in the second. To avoid new tragedies, the freshwater navigation rules were reinforced. Due to these new regulations, the Hautecombe had to be retired from service, that was done in September 1970. Daniel Carraz bought it and removed the motors, then used it as storage facility. In 1976, Alain Prud'homme bought the ferry Hautecombe and used it as headquarters for his sailing school. The ship took back its original name and was moored at the Grand Port of Aix-les-Bains, near the docks for the company's ships . It was later converted into a maritime store. On February 8, 2015, it dragged its anchor and a part of its gangway was snatched due to strong winds. The ship was not damaged and the gangway was repaired some days later.

Completed in 1887 to a design by Axel M√∏ller, it was the first church to be built in the rapidly growing new town. History When Esbjerg was first developed in the late 1860s, the nearest church was in Jerne to the east. A committee set up in 1885 called for a new church to be built in the centre of Esbjerg as soon as possible. The government responded in 1886, granting half the necessary funding, the remainder being provided by Ribe Diocese. Construction began in May 1887 and the church was consecrated on 18 December the same year. In late 1990, the church became a parish in its own right. The first priest was installed in March 1891. Architecture Located on the corner of Skolegade and Kirkegade, the church is a typical Neoromantic building in red brick with belts of grey stone on a granite socle. It originally consisted of a nave with a chancel and apse at the east end and an entrance through the tower to the west. M√∏ller expanded the building in 1896 with transepts to the north and south fitted with galleries, doubling the seating capacity from 400 to 800. The outer walls are decorated with lesenes, round-arched friezes and a toothed cornice. The roof is slated, including the roof on the pyramid-shaped spire. Interior In 1929, the church was decorated with frescos by Ole S√∏ndergaard: the Paschal Lamb on the apse vault, Jesus blessing the children on the north wall, the Return of the Prodigal Son on the south wall and the Crucifixion on the chancel arch with groups of people on either side. The large Emmaus painting on the altarpiece is also the work of S√∏ndergaard. The granite font is an old Romanesque piece which was found in the rectory garden in Jerne. The bowl is decorated with a relief with small triangular heads. There is a finely carved wooden pulpit with a canopy. I.C. M√∏ller park The church's former cemetery was converted into I.C.

The Animal Rights Movement in America. Twayne Publishers, 1994; p. 87.Norm Phelps. The Longest Struggle. Lantern Books, 2004; pp. 190, 226. FARM was co-founded by Dr. Alex Hershaft in 1976 as the Vegetarian Information Service to distribute information on the benefits of a vegetarian diet.

In 1976, Hershaft founded the Vegetarian Information Service (VIS) to distribute information on the benefits of a vegetarian diet. That same year, he participated in the hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, which led to the publication of Dietary Goals for the United States, and eventually to the periodic publication of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Subsequently, VIS testified before Congress in favor of the 1978 National Consumer Nutrition Information Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1978. Accordingly, in the summer of 1981, Hershaft organized Action For Life, a national conference in Allentown, Pennsylvania, that effectively launched the U.S. animal rights movement. Participants included such animal rights pioneers as Cleveland Amory, Ingrid Newkirk, Alex Pacheco, Peter Singer, Henry Spira, Gretchen Wyler, as well as radio host Thom Hartmann. These conferences continued for seven more years in San Francisco (1982), Montclair, NJ (1983), Los Angeles (1985), Chicago (1986), Cambridge, Massachusetts (1987), and Washington (1984 and 1991).Lawrence & Susan Finsen.

Beginning in 2000, conference presenters have been inducting to a U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame national leaders, authors, or other key agents of change who have made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of animal rights in the U.S. for at least ten years. Legacy Aside from the specific accomplishments of its own 14 programs (including the three defunct ones), FARM has had a number of impacts on the U.S. Animal Rights Movement, in particular, and U.S. dietary and social justice advocacy, in general: * FARM's 1981 Action for Life conference provided the springboard for formation of the U.S. animal rights movement. FARM's current annual conferences still offer the only national networking opportunity for movement leaders and activists. * FARM has been largely responsible for turning the U.S. animal rights movement mission from vivisection to animal farming, which accounts for 98% of all animal abuse and killing. FARM's Veal Ban Campaign and World Farm Animals Day were the first farmed animal advocacy programs in the U.S. * FARM's 10 Billion Lives, Live Vegan, and Meatout Mondays programs have promoted vegan advocacy by recognizing that new vegans need sustained support to keep from reverting to consumption of animal products. * FARM's Great American Meatout was a forerunner to similar annual grassroots diet education campaigns by the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, and Center for Science in the Public Interest, as well as the 2003 revival of the Meatless Monday campaign by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and the 2009 Meat- Free Monday campaign by Paul McCartney. * FARM's Congressional testimonies, participation in numerous national party platform hearing and conventions, and national polls of candidates for public office brought the concept of veganism and animal rights to key U.S. legislators, executives, and journalists.Lawrence & Susan Finsen. The Animal Rights Movement in America. Twayne Publishers, 1994; p. 84. * Equal Justice Alliance is bringing the concept of freedom of advocacy for animal rights and other social justice issues to the highest levels of U.S. legal community.

Early life Coupe was born in Watford, Hertfordshire in 1960. He grew up in West Sussex. Coupe received a bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Birmingham in 1982. Career Coupe began his career at Unilever, where he became assistant brand manager for Flora margarine. Coupe joined Sainsbury's in 2004. In 2010, he became responsible for the marketing, trading and online operations of the company. In January 2014, Sainsbury's then CEO Justin King announced Coupe as his successor, after stating that he would be leaving the role in June 2014. Soon after Coupe's appointment, he announced a strategic review that aimed to address the challenges caused by a changing retail market. In 2016 he led the takeover of Home Retail Group which included Argos and Habitat. In March 2018 he announced new pay arrangements for colleagues. Coupe oversaw digital transformation and investment at Sainsbury‚Äôs, including the introduction of the UK's first till-free stores and the digitisation of the Nectar loyalty card through a new app and website. In January 2020 it was announced that Coupe would retire from his position at the end of May 2020, to be succeeded by Simon Roberts, the company's head of retail and operations. In October 2020, Coupe took a three-month appointment as head of COVID-19 infection testing at NHS Test and Trace, an outsourced agency created by the government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal life He married Jill Parkinson in Richmond upon Thames in May 1990, and they have two daughters. In recent years he has lived in the Holgate area of York but he frequently travels between London and Yorkshire. He is a keen guitarist and also enjoys photography and cycling. Coupe became a life patron for GroceryAid in August 2015. He was previously the fundraising president from 2012 to 2014. Controversies In April 2018, Coupe took part in interviews in relation to a forthcoming merger between Sainsbury's and Walmart-owned UK subsidiary Asda. After the first interview, during the transition to the next, his microphone remained switched on and he began singing 'We're in the Money'. The video was widely shared and critiqued. Coupe later released a statement apologising for his \\"unfortunate choice of song, from the musical 42nd Street\\", which he had seen the previous year. Sainsbury's issued a further statement: \\"We all know these songs stay in your head. To attach any wider meaning to this innocent, personal moment is preposterous.\\" When the merger failed to get approvals, he accused the Competition and Markets Authority of having \\"fundamentally moved the goalposts... changed the shape of the ball and chosen a completely different playing field\\" in its analysis. He said that with \\"a completely unpredictable set of competition rules, who would invest in this country?\\", telling BBC Radio 4: \\"This is just outrageous\\". In 2019 he was criticised for reducing the amount traditionally paid towards a Christmas party for Argos colleagues, when he sought to bring it in line with money paid towards the Sainsbury‚Äôs Christmas party.

Approaches This article describes the generation of a net of triangles. In literature there are contributions which deal with the optimization of a given net. Surface triangulations are important for * visualizing surfaces and * the application of finite element methods. The triangulation of a parametrically defined surface is simply achieved by triangulating the area of definition (see second figure, depicting the Monkey Saddle). However, the triangles may vary in shape and extension in object space, posing a potential drawback. This can be minimized through adaptive methods that consider step width while triangulating the parameter area. To triangulate an implicit surface (defined by one or more equations) is more difficult. There exist essentially two methods. * One method divides the 3D region of consideration into cubes and determines the intersections of the surface with the edges of the cubes in order to get polygons on the surface, which thereafter have to be triangulated (cutting cube method).M. Schmidt: Cutting Cubes ‚Äì visualizing implicit surfaces by adaptive polygonization. Visual Computer (1993) 10, pp. 101‚Äì115J. Bloomenthal: Polygonization of implicit surfaces, Computer Aided Geometric Design (1988), pp. 341‚Äì355 The expenditure for managing the data is great. * The second and simpler concept is the marching method.E.

Akkouche & E Galin: Adaptive Implicit Surface Polygonization Using Marching Triangles, COMPUTER GRAPHICS forum (2001), Vol. 20, pp. 67‚Äì80 The triangulation starts with a triangulated hexagon at a starting point. This hexagon is then surrounded by new triangles, following given rules, until the surface of consideration is triangulated. If the surface consists of several components, the algorithm has to be started several times using suitable starting points. The cutting cube algorithm determines, at the same time, all components of the surface within the surrounding starting cube depending on prescribed limit parameters. An advantage of the marching method is the possibility to prescribe boundaries (see picture). Polygonizing a surface means to generate a polygon mesh. The triangulation of a surface should not be confused with the triangulation of a discrete prescribed plane set of points. See Delaunay triangulation.

The squadron quickly moved to NAS Quonset Point, and was redesignated VC-12. In succession, it operated the TBM Avenger, AF Guardian, and the AD-5W Skyraider. In 1956, the squadron was re-designated VAW-12 (Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWELVE) and acquired a new aircraft, the Guppy version of the Skyraider. In 1961, the WF-2 Tracer, affectionately called the \\"Willie Fudd\\", arrived, and the following year the squadron returned to NAS Norfolk.

The squadron had grown to over 200 officers and 800 enlisted personnel, thus VAW-12 was reorganized as an Air Wing. On 1 April 1967, VAW-12 was disestablished and Carrier Airborne Early Warning Wing Twelve was formed to command all Atlantic Fleet Airborne Early Warning (AEW) efforts. Replacement Airgroup Squadron RVAW-120 was formed to train aviators and enlisted personnel in carrier-based AEW aircraft. VAW-121, VAW-122, and VAW-123 were formed from former VAW-12 operating detachments.

She works in various media including sculpture, installations, video, performance, and social practice. Leigh has described her work as auto-ethnographic, and her interests include African art and vernacular objects, performance, and feminism.Grimes, William. 2015, \\"Distinct Prisms in an Ever-Shifting Kaleidoscope\\", The New York Times, April 16. Her work is concerned with the marginalization of women of color and reframes their experience as central to society. Leigh has often said that her work is focused on ‚ÄúBlack female subjectivity,‚Äù with an interest in complex interplays between various strands of history.  Early life and education  Leigh was born to Jamaican parents and received a BA in Art and minored in Philosophy from Earlham College in 1990.  Career  > \\"I came to my artistic practice via the study of philosophy, cultural > studies, and a strong interest in African and African American art, which > has imbued my object and performance-based work with a concern for the > ethnographic, especially the way it records and describes objects.\\" The artist combines her training in American ceramics with an interest in African pottery, using African motifs which tend to have modernist characteristics. Though Leigh considers herself to be primarily a sculptor, she recently has been involved in social sculpture, or social practice work that engages the public directly. Her objects often employ materials and forms traditionally associated with African art, and her performance-influenced installations create spaces where historical precedent and self-determination co-mingle. She describes this combination representing \\"a collapsing of time.\\" Her work has been described as part of a generation's reimagining of ceramics in a cross-disciplinary context. She has given artist lectures in many institutions nationally and internationally, and has taught in the ceramics department of the Rhode Island School of Design. In October of 2020, Leigh was selected to represent the United States at the prestigious 2022 Venice Biennale. She is the first black woman to do so. Works and critical reception Leigh has exhibited internationally including: MoMA PS1, Walker Art Center, Studio Museum in Harlem, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, The Hammer Museum, The Kitchen, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Tilton Gallery, Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, SculptureCenter, Kunsthalle Wien in Vienna, L'appartement 22 in Rabat, Morocco, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and the Association for Visual Arts Gallery in Cape Town, South Africa. Leigh organized an event with a group of women artists, who performed in \\"Black Women Artists for Black Lives Matter\\" part of her solo exhibition, The Waiting Room at the New Museum in 2016. Leigh's work was selected among \\"the most important and relevant work\\" by curators Jane Panetta and Rujeko Hockley for the 2019 Whitney Biennial. During her residency at the New Museum, Leigh founded an organization called Black Women Artists for Black Lives Matter (BWAforBLM), a collective formed in direct response to the murder of Philando Castille, and in protest against other similar injustices against black lives. Simone Leigh is the creator of the Free People's Medical Clinic a social practice project created with Creative Time in 2014.Davis, Samara. 2015. \\"Room for Care.\\" TDR: The Drama Review 59, no. 4: 169‚Äì176. A reenactment of the Black Panther Party's initiative of the same name. The installation was located in a 1914 Bed-Stuy brownstone called the Stuyvesant Mansion, previously owned by notable African-American doctor Josephine English (1920‚Äì2011). As an homage to this history, Leigh created a walk-in health center with yoga, nutrition and massage sessions, staffed by volunteers in 19th-century nurse uniforms. She is the recipient of many awards, including: a Guggenheim Fellowship; The Herb Alpert Award; a Creative Capital grant; a Blade of Grass Fellowship; the Studio Museum in Harlem's Joyce Alexander Wein Artist Prize; the Guggenheim Museum's Hugo Boss Prize; United States Artists fellowship; and a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2018). She was named one of Artsy Editorial's \\"Most Influential Artists\\" of 2018. Her work has been written about in many publications, including Art In America, Artforum, Sculpture Magazine, Modern Painters, The New Yorker, The New York Times, Small Axe, and Bomb magazine.Brick House by Simone Leigh  Brick House  Brick House is a bronze bust of a Black woman with a torso standing at 16 feet tall and looks out over the raised outdoor park in New York. The sculptures torso combines the forms of a skirt and a clay house. The sculpture‚Äôs head is crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids. This is the first piece in Leigh's Anatomy of Architecture collection, an ongoing body of work in where the artist combines architectural forms from regions as varied as West Africa and the Southern United States with the human body. Brick House combines a number of different architectural styles: \\"Batammaliba architecture from Benin and Togo, the teleuk dwellings of the Mousgoum people of Cameroon and Chad, and the restaurant Mammy‚Äôs Cupboard in Natchez, Mississippi.\\" The content of Leigh's sculpture contrasts the location it is in directly, as it is surrounded by \\"glass-and-steel towers shoot up from among older industrial- era brick buildings, and where architectural and human scales are in constant negotiation.\\" The Waiting Room The Waiting Room was exhibited at the New Museum in New York City from June to September 2016. This exhibition honors Esmin Elizabeth Green, who died from blood clots after sitting in a waiting room of a Brooklyn hospital for 24 hours, and provides an alternative vision of health care shaped by female, African-American experience. In an interview with the Guardian, Leigh says \\"obedience is one of the main threats to black women's health\\" and \\"what happened to Green is an example of the lack of empathy people have towards the pain of black women.\\" The Waiting Room involved public and private care sessions from different traditions of medicine such as herbalism, meditation rooms, movement studios, and other holistic approaches to healthcare. Outside of museum hours this exhibition became \\"The Waiting Room Underground\\" providing free, private workshops outside of the public eye, an homage to the healthcare work of the Black Panthers and the United Order of Tents. Additionally this exhibition featured lectures; workshops on self-defense, home economics, and self-awareness; Taiko drumming lessons for LGBTQ youth, and summer internships with the museum for teens. This work came after and is related to Leigh's previous project Free People's Medical Clinic (2014).  Awards received  Leigh is a recipient of The Studio Museum in Harlem's Joyce Alexander Wein Artist Prize (2017); John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2016); Anonymous Was a Woman Award (2016); Herb Alpert Award in the Arts (2016); and A Blade of Grass Fellowship for Socially Engaged Art (2016).

From the village of Rivi√®re-√†-Pierre, the main access road to the Zec consists of a stretch of 30 km through the Portneuf Wildlife Reserve (routes 2 and 29). In the Zec, the road network comprises 130 km motorable. The road north of the Lightning River provides access to a dozen of lakes such as Seaton, Montplaisir and \\"des Passes\\", as well as Mo√Øse River. The Batiscan Lake is accessible by land or by boat using the Mo√Øse River. The Zec has four campgrounds semi-fitted around the lakes Batiscan, White, La Salle and Lietto.  History  In 1978, following the abolition of private clubs by the Government of Qu√©bec, Zec de la Rivi√®re-Blanche was formed, initially covering an area of in the Portneuf County, Quebec. Zec has been administered by the \\"L'Association sportive Miguick inc\\" (Athletic Association Miguick) (ASM). In the early 1980s, the land area was increased by by adding a part of the famous Club hunting and fishing Seigneurie du Triton (Lordship of Triton). The present territory of the Zec covers .  Geography  The territory of the ZEC is an integral part of the Batiscanie (watershed of Batiscan River). Zec is bounded on the south by Portneuf Wildlife Reserve, on the west by the Zec Jeannotte, on the north by the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve and on the east by the Zec Batiscan-Neilson. The Batiscan River is the western boundary of Zec, north of Miguick River. The five main rivers are all exploited by Zec for fishing activities: * White River whose headwater lake is White Lake; * Lightning River which rises in Batiscan Lake * Mo√Øse River * Miguick River * Batiscan River. The territory of the Zec includes 240 lakes, 150 are used for fishing including lakes Brochu, Funny, Gaston and Gorren. Major lakes are: * Batiscan Lake (east-west direction), which is the northeastern boundary of the territory of Zec, * Lasalle Lake, located in the center of the Zec, * The White Lake, * \\"Ci-joint lake\\", * Constantin Lake. White River (Portneuf Regional County Municipality) The White River covers a large catchment area (adjacent to the west side of the upper basin of the Rivi√®re-√†-Pierre), taking its source in White Lake where a dam is fitted at its mouth. More than a dozen small surrounding lakes flow into the White Lake. Down, the waters of the White River flow into a series of lakes to the village of Rivi√®re-√†-Pierre lakes Lupe, Ralph, Gilles, Tony, lietto and Lorenzo. Portneuf Wildlife Reserve The Portneuf Wildlife Reserve includes the middle part of the watershed of the White river. In back, the White River, we reached the southern boundary of the reserve, located in (direct line) from the village of Rivi√®re-√†-Pierre. While the last water before the northern limit of the plans are the Central and Ferriere lakes. The northern part of the watershed of the White River is integrated into the Zec de la Rivi√®re-Blanche, including lakes Lorenzo and Tonty.

Restoration of lakes  In 2012, with the financial participation of $81,500 in grants, four lakes of the Zec de la Rivi√®re-Blanche have been treated: Lastre, Zigzag, Palme, Dual and Bert. This initiative will increase the potential for fishing. These partners are the Fondation de la faune du Qu√©bec, the Regional Conference of the Capitale- Nationale (implementation PDIRT), Ministry of Natural Resources (Phase II) and Guy Chevrette Foundation. Restored in 2009, Swayne Lake is the first of the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale to have been restored. It was reopened to fishing in 2013.

He was the lead editor of the Old Book of Tang, one of the official histories of the preceding Tang Dynasty, completed during Later Jin, although most of the work was probably completed during the term of his predecessor Zhao Ying.  Background  Liu Xu was born in 887, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. His family was from Zhuo Prefecture (Ê∂øÂ∑û, in modern Baoding, Hebei). His grandfather Liu Cheng () and father Liu Yin () both served as officers at You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing). It was said that in his youth, Liu Xu was known for his handsome appearance and his literary abilities, and both his older brother Liu Xuan (rendered ÂäâÊôÖ in the History of the Five Dynasties and ÂäâÊöÑ in the New History of the Five DynastiesNew History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 55.) and younger brother Liu Hao () were known in their home territory. Sometime during the Tianyou era (904-907), there was a time when forces of the Khitan captured Zhuo, and Liu Xu was captured and taken to Xin Prefecture (Êñ∞Â∑û, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), but he escaped his Khitan captors. He later took up residence at Mount Daning (), living with L√º Mengqi () (later a Later Tang official as well) and Zhang Lin (), spending the time reciting and writing poems. At one point, Wang Chuzhi, then ruling Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding) as its military governor (Jiedushi), commissioned his adoptive son Wang Du as the prefect of Yi Prefecture (ÊòìÂ∑û, in modern Baoding). Wang Du invited Liu to serve on his staff as his secretary in military matters. Later, after Wang Du completed his term as the prefect of Yi ‚Äî probably at the time that Wang Chuzhi commissioned Wang Du as the deputy military governor of YiwuZizhi Tongjian, vol. 271.Based on subsequent events, this was probably in or about 919. ‚Äî Liu requested to leave governmental service. Instead, Wang Du invited him to go to Yiwu's capital Zhongshan () with Wang Du. At that time, Liu Xu's older brother Liu Xuan also arrived from Zhuo, and Wang Du recommended both of them to his father Wang Chuzhi. Wang Chuzhi commissioned Liu Xu as his secretary in headquarter matters, and shortly after promoted to him to be the secretary in Wang Chuzhi's role as governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi). About two years later, in 921, Wang Du seized control of the circuit from his father Wang Chuzhi in a coup. As one of Wang Du's close associates, He Shaowei (), had previous disputes with Liu Xuan, he made false accusations against Liu Xuan, and Wang Du killed Liu Xuan. Liu Xu fled the circuit, and took up residence at Cang Prefecture (ÊªÑÂ∑û, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), in Jin territory. The military governor of Henghai Circuit (Ê©´Êµ∑, headquartered at Cang Prefecture), Li Cunshen, invited him to serve as secretary.  During Later Tang = During Li Cunxu's reign  After Li Cunshen's lord and adoptive brother Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin claimed the title of emperor (of a new Later Tang) in 923,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. he made Liu Xu a Taichang Boshi (), a scholar at the ministry of worship (Â§™Â∏∏ÂØ∫, Taichang Si), and shortly after an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). He was also made Shanbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu), and later promoted to be Bibu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu). He later left governmental service for some time when his mother died, to observe a period of mourning. After the period was complete, he was made Kubu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu), and also resumed his role as imperial scholar.  During Li Siyuan's reign  Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny in 926, and his adoptive brother Li Siyuan became emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. After Li Siyuan became emperor, Liu Xu was made a Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng); he later also assumed the posts of deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) and scholar at Duanming Hall (). It was said that Li Siyuan respected him for his gracefulness and favored him for his mild disposition. In 933, Liu was given the titles of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau) and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor;Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. he was also made the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu).  After Li Siyuan's reign  Li Siyuan died in 933, and was initially succeeded by his son Li Conghou the Prince of Song. However, in 934, Li Conghou's chiefs of staff (Shumishi) Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun, not wanting his older adoptive brother Li Congke the Prince of Lu and his brother-in-law Shi Jingtang to become too entrenched at their circuits, transferred them both, causing Li Congke to rebel in fear at his military command at Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), believing that they were targeting him for elimination. Li Congke quickly defeated the imperial forces sent against him, and thereafter headed for the imperial capital Luoyang. As he approached Luoyang, Li Conghou fled Luoyang in panic, while Zhu committed suicide and Feng was killed by the imperial guard general An Congjin. An thereafter requested that the three chancellors ‚Äî Liu Xu and his colleagues Feng Dao and Li Yu ‚Äî lead the civilian officials in welcoming Li Congke. The three chancellors conferred with each other and initially were unsure what to do, but with An rushing them, agreed to welcome Li Congke, who subsequently entered Luoyang and claimed the throne. (He subsequently sent emissaries to kill Li Conghou.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. After Li Congke took the throne, he put Liu in charge of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies), after the official Wang Mei (), whom he initially put in charge of the three agencies, was found to inflate the amount of treasury reserves. He was also given the additional titles of minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu) and Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng)). Shortly after, Feng Dao, one of whose children had married one of Liu's children, was sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Kuangguo Circuit (Âå°Âúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), leaving Liu and Li Yu serving as chancellors. Without Feng to moderate them, they quickly developed frequent arguments, as Liu was said to be critical and paying attention to details, while Li Yu was said to be strong-willed, particularly because when they discussed what changes might be necessary, Li Yu would satirize Liu and Feng's children's marital relationship by stating, \\"This was the doing of your wise marital relations. Is it not right to change it?\\" With them in frequent disputes, not much was being done at the office of the chancellors, causing much aggravation for Li Congke. Li Congke thus made Lu Wenji an additional chancellor. Meanwhile, after Liu took over the three financial agencies from Wang, he had his secretary Gao Yanshang () carefully go through the records to see how much money the treasury actually still had. He discovered that much of the purported treasury reserves were in fact uncollectible debts that the administrators kept on the books to use as excuses to harshly collect from the people. Liu reported this to Li Congke and advocated a two-pronged approach ‚Äî that the government make all efforts to collect the collectible debts but forgive the uncollectible ones. Li Congke's chief of staff Han Zhaoyin concurred in this, and Li Congke issued an edict forgiving much of the debts that were accumulated from before Li Siyuan's Changxing era (930-933). The poor were very thankful, but the administrators at the three agencies resented Liu for this reform. When, shortly after, Liu and Li Yu were removed from their chancellor posts, with Liu being made You Pushe () and no longer in charge of the three agencies, the administrators were all celebrating, and none of them accompanied Liu on his journey back to his mansion, as was customary.  During Later Jin = During Shi Jingtang's reign  In 936, Shi Jingtang rebelled against Li Congke at Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and, with support from Khitan Empire's Emperor Taizong, overthrew Li Congke, ending Later Tang and starting his own Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. However, for quite some time, his realm was not pacified, and in 937, when the major general Fan Yanguang rose against Shi at Tianxion Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), the general Zhang Congbin () rose at Luoyang (which was no longer capital at that point ‚Äî Kaifeng was) in support of Fan and killed Shi's sons Shi Chongxin () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) and Shi Chong'ai () the acting defender of Luoyang, whom Shi Jingtang left in charge of the region. After Zhang's rebellion was suppressed shortly after,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Shi Jingtang made Liu Xu the defender of Luoyang and the acting mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region), and soon thereafter put him back in charge of the directorate of salt and iron monopolies. In 938, when Shi was offering grand honorable titles to Emperor Taizong (who might have changed the name of his state from Khitan to Liao by that point) and Emperor Taizong's mother Empress Dowager Shul√º, he sent Feng Dao and Liu to Khitan to do so, with Feng in charge of offering the honors to Empress Dowager Shul√º and Liu in charge of offering the honors to Emperor Taizong. Upon their return, Liu was given the titles of Taizi Taibao () and Zuo Pushe (), and created the Duke of Qiao. (His Taizi Taibao title was shortly after changed to Taizi Taifu ()  During Shi Chonggui's reign  In 944, by which time Shi Jingtang had died and been succeeded by his nephew Shi Chonggui ‚Äî at which time Later Jin was constantly at war with Liao due to Shi Chonggui's defiance toward Liao ‚Äî Liu Xu was again made Menxia Shilang and chancellor, as well as Sikong ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. He was also put in charge of editing the imperial history and directing the three financial agencies. In 945, it was therefore he and the historian Zhang Zhaoyuan () who presented the newly completed Old Book of Tang to Shi Chonggui, and were rewarded for the work.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 84. (However, Zhao Ying, who had served as chancellor during Shi Jingtang's reign, appeared to have begun the work with five other historians, including Zhang, in or shortly before 941.)History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 79. Also in 945, when Shi Chonggui's close associates Feng Yu (the brother of Shi Chonggui's wife Empress Feng) and Li Yangtao () were repeatedly defaming the chancellor-chief of staff Sang Weihan, Shi considered removing Sang from his posts, but at the urging of Liu and fellow chancellor Li Song, did not do so, although he made Feng Yu a chief of staff as well to divide Sang's authorities.  After Later Jin's fall  In 946, after Shi Chonggui sent the generals Du Wei and Li Shouzhen to attack Liao, Liao's Emperor Taizong counterattacked, surrounding Du and Li and getting them to surrender to him. He then attacked south toward Kaifeng, which was left undefended. Shi surrendered, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Emperor Taizong thereafter, in early 947, declared himself the emperor of China as well. For sometime, Liu and the other Later Jin chancellors remained chancellor, but Liu shortly after requested to resign based on an eye ailment. He was allowed to do so, and was given the title of Taibao. When Emperor Taizong withdrew from Kaifeng later that year, he took many of the high-level former Later Jin officials with him,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. but Liu was allowed to remain at Kaifeng due to his ailment. He died in the summer of 947. After the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan subsequently claimed the title of emperor of a new Later Han, he posthumously honored Liu.

The corresponding country house is Althorp in Northamptonshire. The Strand front of Northumberland House in 1752, by Canaletto. Note the \\"Percy Lion\\" atop the central facade. In British usage, the term townhouse originally referred to the town or city residence, in practice normally in London, of a member of the nobility or gentry, as opposed to their country seat, generally known as a country house or, colloquially, for the larger ones, stately home. The grandest of the London townhouses were stand-alone buildings, but many were terraced buildings. British property developers and estate agents often market new buildings as townhouses, following the North American usage of the term, to aggrandise modest dwellings and to avoid the negative connotation of cheap terraced housing built in the Victorian era to accommodate workers. The aristocratic pedigree of terraced housing, for example as survives in St James's Square in Westminster, is widely forgotten. The term is comparable to the h√¥tel particulier, which housed the French nobleman in Paris, and to the urban domus of the nobiles of Ancient Rome. Background Historically, a town house (later townhouse) was the city residence of a noble or wealthy family, who would own one or more country houses, generally manor houses, in which they lived for much of the year and from the estates surrounding which they derived much of their wealth and political power. Many of the Inns of Court in London served this function; for example, Gray's Inn was the London townhouse of Reginald de Grey, 1st Baron Grey de Wilton (d. 1308). From the 18th century, landowners and their servants would move to a townhouse during the social season (when balls and other society gatherings took place).For a description of an 18th-century town house in England, for example, see Olsen, Kirsten. Daily Life in 18th-Century England. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 84‚Äì85. *Also see Stewart, Rachel. The Town House in Georgian London. Yale University Press for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, 2009. From the 18th century, most townhouses were terraced; it was one of the successes of Georgian architecture to persuade the rich to buy terraced houses, especially if they were in a garden square. Only a small minority of them, generally the largest, were detached; even aristocrats whose country houses had grounds of hundreds or thousands of acres often lived in terraced houses in town. For example, the Duke of Norfolk owned Arundel Castle in the country, while from 1722 his London house, Norfolk House, was a terraced house in St James's Square, albeit one over 100 feet (30 metres) wide. England=London 1593 Norden's map of Westminster shows and names many grand London townhouses on the Strand: Yorke House, Durham House, Russell House, Savoy Palace, Somerset House, Arundel House, Leicester House, all downstream from Whitehall Palace. Lambeth Palace is marked as \\"Lambeth Howse\\". In the Middle Ages, the London residences of the nobility were generally situated within the walls or boundary of the City of London, often known as \\"Inns\\". For example, Lincoln's Inn was the town house of the Earl of Lincoln, and Gray's Inn of the Baron Grey de Wilton. They gradually spread onto the Strand, the main ceremonial thoroughfare from the City to the Palace of Westminster, where parliamentary and court business were transacted. Areas such as Kensington and Hampstead were countryside hamlets outside London until the 19th century, so mansions in these areas, such as Holland House, cannot be considered as true historical townhouses. Bishops also had London residences, generally termed palaces, listed below. Many aristocratic townhouses were demolished or ceased to be used for residential purposes after the First World War. The greatest residence on the Strand was the Savoy Palace, residence of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the richest man in the kingdom in his age. The Strand had the advantage of river frontage to the Thames, which gave the nobles their own private landing places. The next fashion was to move still further westwards to St James's, to be near the Tudor royal court. In the 18th century, Covent Garden was developed by the Duke of Bedford on his Bedford Estate, and Mayfair by the Grosvenor family on their Grosvenor Estate. The final fashion before the modern era was for a residence on the former marsh-land of Belgravia, developed after the establishment of Mayfair by the Duke of Westminster. The following examples, most of which are now demolished, are comparable to the Parisian h√¥tel particulier: =Secular houses= Devonshire House, Piccadilly, in 1896 Leicester House on Leicester Fields, 1748 *The Albany *Apsley House, Duke of Wellington; *Baynard's Castle, City of London, Earls of Pembroke 1551-1666;Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol.10, p.406, note f *Berkeley House, residence of Baron Berkeley of Stratton (a junior branch of Baron Berkeley of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire), seated at Bruton Abbey in Somerset, was on the site of Bruton Street, Stratton Street and Berkeley Square in Mayfair, and later became Devonshire House. *Berkeley's Inn, Baynard's Castle, City of London, town house of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley (1353-1417), which he gave in his will to Robert Knollis, a Citizen of London.Smith, Lives of the Berkeleys, Vol.II, pp.447 et seq *Bedford House *Bridgewater House, Westminster *Buckingham House (now Buckingham Palace) *Burlington House (now home of the Royal Academy) *Cambridge House *Chandos House, 2 Queen Anne Street, Marylebone; 3rd Duke of Chandos *Chesterfield House (demolished 1937, now eponymous Mayfair block of flats) *Chudleigh House, Knightsbridge, Westminster, later called Kingston House *Clarence House, the residence of the late Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and now the residence of Charles, Prince of Wales *Clarendon House *Crewe House, Curzon Street, Mayfair, currently the Saudi Arabian embassy *Devonshire House (formerly on Piccadilly, opposite present Ritz Hotel.

Additionally, Dalia Energies has requested permission from the electric authority to conduct a feasibility study for adding additional generation units to the station. The station's primary fuel is natural gas, with light fuel oil acting as a backup fuel. The plant's owners have committed to purchasing at least 1.4 billion cubic meters (BCM) of natural gas annually from the offshore Tamar gas field to power the station.

In 1877 the Diamond Hill Granite Company founded a granite quarry northwest of Diamond Hill and copper was also mined near the hill.\\"The History of Cumberland,\\" History of the State of Rhode Island with Illustrations, (Albert J.

Faulkner Kendall, and Henry Munroe Rogers offered 235 acres of land on the hill to the State of Rhode Island\\" and ski trails were cut shortly thereafter. In the twentieth century, the hill contained two small ski areas, Ski Valley (operating from 1939 to 1981) and Diamond Hill Reservation (operating from the mid-1960s to mid-1980s). In 1939 when the first ski area opened, it was a hike-up and ski-down facility, but operators of the ski areas eventually constructed rope tows, a T-bar, and multiple two person chair lifts. In the 1980s, some of the lifts and equipment were gradually sold, and the ski areas were closed. In 1997 the town of Cumberland acquired Diamond Hill from the State. The hill is now a 373-acre town park and is the starting point of the thirty-three mile Warner Trail. The park features athletic fields, picnic areas, 3.8 miles of hiking trails and a band stand near the pond. A popular event, Cumberlandfest, is held each year on the second weekend of August at Diamond Hill Park. This event features a carnival, with rides and various venues, as well as live entertainment by Matty KayKay and a small fireworks show. Proceeds go to the town's athletic programs.

Tudeley Woods is owned by the Hadlow Estate and managed in partnership with the RSPB.

The result is that there more than 1,000 species of fungi in the woods, with orchids intermingled with carpets of bluebells and primroses in spring. The coppicing allows for charcoal burning, with the products sold locally. Free to access, car parking is restricted, whilst dogs on leads are allowed on the public footpaths and bridleways. The Tunbridge Wells Borough draft local plan published in August 2019, suggests a new town of 2,800 dwellings replacing the village and destroying 600 acres of green belt land including ancient woodland and the habitat of three European protected species. Despite vocal local concern over the destruction of green belt and agricultural land and serious transport issues the borough council have decided to press on with their plan.

Palar River basin, Vaigai River basin and Thamirabarani River basin are the major victims. Illegal quarrying is happening in these areas in broad daylight. Though as per Tamil Nadu Public Works Department, 5,500-6,000 truck loads of 200 cubic ft. of sand is mined each day, in reality the figure are estimated around 55,000 truckloads of 400 cubic ft. of sand per day. In 2013, illegal sand mining in the state was estimated to be worth . This also results in the state exchequer losing over in revenue. Environmental impact Since river sand is a natural aquifer, its depletion also means recharging of groundwater, especially wells, fall. In January 2014, Union minister of state for Commerce and Industry, stated that due to sand mining in river beds, groundwater level or water table has dropped at an alarming rate, as a result some 18 lakh wells in the southern region have gone dry and water for agriculture purposes has become scarce. In Madurai, as per S Rethinavelu, senior president of CII, \\"Water table, which was at 50 ft or so, fell to 600 ft.\\" Response To curtail the rampant mining, in November 2013, Government of Tamil Nadu banned mining in 71 of the 90 sand quarries. Then in January 2014, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests issued guidelines, according to which quarries with lease area of five to 25 hectares can only allow manual mining.

Journalism has been attacked for publishing the leaks and is also viewed in the same light as the whistleblower they work with, U.S government has come down and made arrests. The freedom to press is on its last hinges due to this. Whistleblower is an employee who brings wrongdoing by an employer or a government or law enforcement agency and who is commonly vested by statute with rights and remedies for retaliation. US \\"war against whistleblowers\\" The Obama administration has been characterized as much more aggressive than the Bush and other previous administrations in their response to whistleblowing and leaks to the press,Bill Kovach: \\"It strikes me as a much more aggressive approach on the part of the government than I have experienced in 30 years.\\" Leonard Downie describes the Administration as the \\"most militant\\" since Richard Nixon's regarding leaks. prompting critics to describe Obama's crackdown as a battle against whistleblowers Greenwald: Obama engaged in ‚Äòunprecedented war on whistleblowers‚Äô,\\" The Washington Post\\"The War on Whistleblowers: On the Sin of Being Correct\\", The Nation\\"Obama's War on Whistleblowers\\" Mother Jones.

Trump Current position on Whistleblowers  Since the start of the presidency of Donald Trump his stance on whistleblowers and leakers is that he is furious with them since being in office. This is due to the fact that during one of Donald Trump meetings a secret aide had released what was talked about during the briefing to the press. The topics that were discussed were about Vladimir Putin and Russian relations. Trump also holds the stance that the news organization that publish should be punished. He has gone on rants on his twitter during his presidency complaining about the whistleblowers and leakers. The press believes that Trump has set out to limit the free press and this is another way he is doing that. He also has gone to former FBI director James Comey on serval occasion asking if the department could put a stop to leaks, also asked if journalists arrested. In the past though Donald Trump has stated that \\"Wikileaks is not his thing.\\" But during is run for president he had brought up Wikileaks more than a handful due him talking about the material that put democrats in a bad light, but as we know now he said it will be up to the Attorney General William Barr will decide further action for Assange.  Four NSA Whistleblowers  The best case is the four whistleblowers from the National Security Agency and their names were Thomas Drake,William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis. They had criticized the project called Trailblazer, exposing the NSA for its Multibillion-dollar contact that went awry. It was cancelled in 2006 but it was supposed to bring in an era to surveillance in the digital age it was called SIGINT. The lost money in the projects failure still remains unknown to the public but kept a state secret. This goes all the way back to 2002 when another in-house program was denied by the agency director Gen. Michael Haydenhow devoted it just three weeks before 9/11. So in 2002 the three whistleblowers went to the pentagon to advise them to do an investigation on the NSA. Binney had claimed the United States is in a police state, that concedes with other regimes such as the KGB, the Stasi, Gestapo, and the SS. But the U.S has more power than them because of the technology they have acquired. He describes the U.S state now as the Weimar Republicwas the prior liberal democracy before the Nazi regime. Back in 2011 the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General(OIG) declassified documents that are the only response for the claims that come from the four whistleblowers. The documents go further into the fault of the NSA for wasting resources on the failed attempt at Trailblazer. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a State Department contractor who allegedly had a conversation about North Korea with James Rosen of Fox News Channel, and Jeffrey Sterling, who allegedly was a source for James Risen's book State of War. Risen has also been subpoenaed to reveal his sources, another rare action by the government. Also, Shamai Leibowitz, a contract linguist for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was convicted of leaking information from embassy wiretaps, Such as John Kiriakou, he is serving thirty-month term due to making public that an intelligence ops is using torture. This is where most whistleblowers find themselves viewing awful crimes but while they exposing what is going on they get punished serval, as the ones who have committed the original act goes untouched.  Chelsea Manning Vs United States = Background  Chelsea Manning was a United States Army soldier who in 2013 was convicted of illegally downloading military reports that were unclassified and sensitive military documents. The documents were from both wars the U.S was involved in, Iraq and Afghanistan. Where she had acquired the documents, was on the military base in Baghdad. With the documents that were leaked Manning wanted to put censorship on the sources that would in danger troops or national security such as Nuclear information. She didn't want to in danger any troops by giving away there movements and patterns during the war but instead she wanted to expose the missteps and misguided policies that pledged the war. She had provided Wikileaks with the evidence of the Collateral Murder where the U.S army had killed 12 unarmed citizens with an Apache attack helicopter. They were attacked in a Baghdad suburb. Among the killed two of the victims were Reuters staff. Manning stated that the act was \\"Bloodlust\\", and example of the U.S military acting irresponsible in the Iraq War. As seen on the footage one aerial weapons team eggs on a wounded Iraqi to put up a gun so that they could have probable reason to keep firing. On August 21, 2013 was sentenced to thirty-five years for providing the sensitive documents to WikiLeaks. She only served seven of those years due to be commuted by the out going president Barack Obama. While in prison Manning tried taking her life twice due to the struggles over her gender, trying to fight to get a gender reassignment. = March 8, 2019 Arrest = During a court case that was for investigating Julien Assange ties to Manning herself back prior in 2010. She was ordered to testify in front of a grand jury but since it was a secret panel she refused to testify. So on March 8 was ordered to be put back to jail in Alexandria, VA. She will be locked in there until she testifies or the jury is wound up. She still remains behind bars even till today.  Other Notable Whistleblowers  James Hitselberger, a former contract linguist for the US Navy in Bahrain is charged with possessing classified documents. Edward Snowden, a technical contractor for the NSA and former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is currently at large and has been charged with theft and the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to columnist Glenn Greenwald.Greenwald: Obama engaged in ‚Äòunprecedented war on whistleblowers‚Äô Reporters Without Borders' 2014 Press Freedom Index saw a drop of 13 ranks for the United States due to their \\"treatment of whistleblowers, leakers, and those who assist them\\" in 2013. The country fell to 46th place, between Romania and Haiti. The United Kingdom fell three places for similar reasons. The Index is meant to highlight places where journalists and photographers are free to do their work, as well as places where the work puts them in danger. Reporters Without Borders' executive director Christian Mihr stated: \\"In the US, state persecution of investigative journalists and their sources by security services has reached an unprecedented level. If sources can no longer be trusted, we face a significant curtailment of press freedom and a dramatic step backwards when it comes to democracy.\\" Allegations of government intimidation of The Guardian The Guardian is a UK-based newspaper with an international reach. In 2013, The Guardian received a copy of data from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Legal threats and forced computer destruction In June and July 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron sent Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, to meet with Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian.Footage released of Guardian editors destroying Snowden hard drives  UK news  theguardian.com Accordingly, Heywood ordered the editor to cease publishing articles based on the Snowden disclosures. According to The Guardian, Heywood said: \\"We can do this nicely or we can go to law\\", adding that \\"A lot of people in government think you should be closed down\\". On July 20, the destruction of computer hard-drives was carried out by several Guardian staff members under the observation of experts from GCHQ. The Guardian said the authorities were told of the existence of multiple copies of the data outside the UK. The deputy editor, Paul Johnson, who was involved in the destruction told Luke Harding about the experience. \\"It was purely a symbolic act\\", Johnson said. \\"We knew that. GCHQ knew that. And the government knew that. It was the most surreal event I have witnessed in British journalism\\".

Miranda was detained for nine hours and his laptop and other items were seized. He has since sued the Metropolitan Police for misuse of their powers. According to The Guardian the claim, \\"challenging controversial powers used under schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, maintains that Miranda was not involved in terrorism and says his right to freedom of expression was curtailed\\".David Miranda lawyers argue that Heathrow detention was unlawful, The Guardian, Wednesday 6 November 2013 In December 2013, Greenwald and Miranda openly advocated for asylum in Brazil for Edward Snowden in exchange for the fugitive leaker's cooperation in investigating the NSA.Romero, Simon. \\"Snowden Offers Help to Brazil in Spy Case\\", New York Times, 17 December 2013. Brazil responded by saying that it was not interested in investigating the NSA.  Julien Assange and WikiLeaks  In 2006 Wikileaks was created by Julien Assange and the goal for Wikileaks is to capture the truth by any means, which has put them in the International Spotlight over the years. Since the birth Wikileaks has released classified documents regarding the war effort in the middle east, document regarding the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and releasing the emails from Democratic National Committee staffers.  U.S Crackdown on Assange  On April 11, 2019 Assange was arrested after being taken from the Ecuadorian embassy. The U.S in the Justice Department believes that with the position at Wikileaks during the 2016 elections he had a key role in the Russian attack on the 2016 elections. During the same election had had released DNC staff flies as well, many believe that he released them because the next day was democratic election. Soon after a DNC staffer named Seth Rich was murder and was to believed to be leaking the e-mails. Also the U.S Department of Defense believes that Assange had conspired with Chelsea Manning in cracking a password that was on a U.S Department of Defense computer. Which is stored on a U.S government network and she had downloaded 1,000 of classified documents. Journalists as accomplice?

Early life Charles Williams was born on 4 May 1838 in Coleraine, Ireland. He is descended on his father‚Äôs side from the yeomen of Worcestershire who grew their orchards and tilled their land in the parishes of Tenbury and Mamble. His mother‚Äôs side descended from Scottish settlers who planted Ulster in 1610.Coleraine Chronicle, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, p. 5, 24 March 1900. Williams was educated at Belfast Academy in Belfast under Dr. Reuben John Bryce and at a Greenwich private school under Dr. Goodwin. Later on, he went to Southern United States for his health and took part in a filibustering expedition to Nicaragua, where he saw some hard fighting and was reportedly won the reputation of a blockade-runner. Williams was separated from his party and was lost in the forest for six days. Fevered, he discovered a small boat and managed to return to the nearest British settlement.Coleraine Chronicle, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, 2 May 1885. He served in the London Irish Rifles and had the rank of Sergeant.Dundee Courier & Argus, Tayside, Scotland March 17, 1894 p. 5. Career=Journalist and war correspondent Book cover of The Armenian Campaign: A Diary of the Campaign of 1877, in Armenia and Koordistan. He returned to England in 1859, where he became a volunteer, and a leader writer for the London Evening Herald. In October 1859, he had begun a connection with The Standard which had lasted until 1884. From 1860 until 1863, he worked as a first editor for the London Evening Standard; and from 1882 until 1884, as editor of The Evening News. Williams was best known for being a war correspondent. He was described as an admirable war correspondent, a daring rider as well as writer.\\"Mr. Chas. Williams' Parliamentary Candidature\\", Coleraine Chronicle, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, 3 July 1886. p. 6. For The Standard, he was at the headquarters of the Arm√©e de la Loire, a French army, during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He was also one of the first correspondents in Strasbourg, where the French forces were defeated. In the summer and autumn of 1877, he was a correspondent to Ahmed Muhtar Pasha who commanded the Turkish forces in Armenia during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 and 1878. Williams remained constantly at the Turkish front, and his letters were the only continuous series that reached England. In 1878, he published this series in a revised and extended form as The Armenian Campaign: A Diary of the Campaign on 1877, in Armenia and Koordistan, which was a large accurate record of the war, even though it was pro-Turkish.\\"A Soldier of the Pencil: One of London's famous war correspondents\\". The New York Times. 10 August 1887. From Armenia, he followed Muhtar Pasha to European Turkey and described his defence of the lines of Constantinople against the Imperial Russian Army. Williams was with General Mikhail Skobelev at the headquarters of the Imperial Russian Army when the Treaty of San Stefano was signed in March 1878. He reported this at the Berlin Congress. At the end of 1878, he was in Afghanistan reporting the war, and in 1879 published the Notes on the Operations in Lower Afghanistan, 1878‚Äì9, with Special Reference to Transport. In the autumn of 1884, representing the Central News Agency of London, Williams also joined the Gordon Relief Expedition, a British mission to relieve in Major-General Charles George Gordon in Khartoum, Sudan. His was the first dispatch to tell of the loss of Gordon. While in Sudan, he quarrelled with Henry H. S. Pearse of The Daily News, who later unsuccessfully sued him. After leaving The Standard in 1884, he worked with the Morning Advertiser, but later worked with the Daily Chronicle as a war correspondent. He was the only British correspondent to be with the Bulgarian Army under Prince Alexander Joseph of Battenberg during the Serbo-Bulgarian War in November 1885. In the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, he was attached to the Greek forces in Thessaly. His last war reporting was on Herbert Kitchener's Sudanese campaign of 1898. His health did not permit his advance to South Africa, but he was still able to London a diary of the South African War for The Morning Leader.\\"Mr. Williams Campaigns: Interesting Lecture by the English War Correspondent\\". The New York Times. 15 December 1887. In 1887, Williams met with then United States General of the Army, General Philip Sheridan in Washington, D.C. to update the general on European affairs and the prospects of upcoming conflicts. Politics He once tried to bid once as a Conservative Party candidate for the House of Commons representative of Leeds West, a borough in Leeds, West Yorkshire, during the 1885 General Election. He was failed to win the seat against Liberal candidate Herbert Gladstone. He once served as the Chairman of the London district of the Institute of Journalists from 1893 to 1894. He founded the London Press Club where he also served as its President from 1896 to 1897. Military service Williams was wounded three times in action. He was shot in the leg in Egypt in 1885 during General Buller's retreat from Gubat to Korti. Williams was a member of the 1st Surrey Rifles, a volunteer unit of the British Army;\\"1st Surrey Rifles\\". Volunteer Service Gazette. 29 November 1890. p. 65. a member of the London Irish Volunteers; and was a known marksman.\\"Irish Volunteers\\". Coleraine Chronicle. 16 November 1861. p. 3. Lectures Williams is said to have possessed a voice of thunder and expressed with terrific energy. He conducted a lecture tour of the United States where he described the six campaigns, illustrated by limelight photographs. His audience in Brooklyn, New York was described by The New York Times as highly delighted by his lecture about the hardships and adventures. His presentation was \\"a feast for the eyes and ears and was highly appreciated by the large audience assembled.\\" He later toured England, Scotland, and Ireland speaking about his then seven campaigns. African expeditions A friend of explorer Henry Morton Stanley, Williams gave him a compass that had been on a number of his expeditions. Stanley took it with him to Africa and it now is on display at the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Belgium. Author Williams also wrote fiction, including his book \\"John Thaddeus Mackay,\\" a tale about religious tolerance and understanding. With the sanction of Commander in Chief, Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley, Williams edited a book \\"Songs for Soldiers for the March The Camp and the Barracks\\" to improve morale and relieve boredom. Included in the book are a number of songs that he composed. He also wrote about ecclesiastical questions, and contributed articles and stories to different periodicals. Williams was a strong adherent to Garnet Wolseley's military views and policy, and had considerable military knowledge.\\"Brave War Correspondents\\". The New York Times. 22 May 1898. He had also published military subjects in several publications such as the United Service Magazine, the National Review, and other periodicals. In 1892, he published Life of Sir H. Evelyn Wood, which was controversial as he defended the actions of Wood after the Battle of Majuba Hill in 1881. In 1902, he published a pamphlet, entitled Hush Up, in which he protested against the proposed limited official inquiry to the South African War and called for an investigation. Others A sketch of Charles Frederick Williams. Early in his career, Charles Williams shared an office with friend and colleague Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, who would later become Lord Salisbury, Prime Minister of Great Britain. They had a standing tradition of always sending out for two beers with payment alternating between each man. Many years later, Williams was in the lobby of the House of Lords. Lord Salisbury approached him with outstretched hand and asked, \\"By the way, Mr. Williams, whose turn is it to stand the beer?\\" In 1884, the steamer carrying Williams and colleague Frederic Villiers of The Graphic overturned in the Nile River. Their rescue led Williams to later commission a unique ivory and gold mitre for the Bishop of London as a thank-offering to God for his safe return from Khartoum. In Rudyard Kipling's play, The Light that Failed, the character of Mr. Nilghai, the war correspondent, was based on Charles Williams. Williams received a personal invitation from King Edward VII to attend the funeral of his mother, Queen Victoria.Coleraine Chronicle, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, 20 February 1904. Both of Williams' sons became journalists. Frederick George H. Williams was a noted parliamentary reporter, writer, and historian in Canada. Francis Austin Ward Williams practiced journalism in Sydney, Australia.\\"The late Mr. Charles Williams.\\" Coleraine Constitution and Northern Counties Advertiser, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, 27 February 1904. Published works Book cover of The Life of Sir Lieut-General Evelyn Wood by Charles Williams. The following are the publications of Charles Frederick Williams: * The Armenian Campaign: A Diary of the Campaign of 1877, in Armenia and Koordistan (1877) * Notes on the Operations in Lower Afghanistan, 1878-9, with Special References to Transport (1879) * John Thaddeus Mackay (1889) * \\"How We Lost Gordon\\" (Fortnightly Review, May 1895) * The Thessalian Campaign (1897) * The Life of Sir Lieut-General Evelyn Wood * England's Defences * Songs for Soldiers * Army Reform * Hushed Up, a Criticism on the South African Campaign * Numerous articles in the United Services Magazine and other publications Recognition In the Nile Campaign of 1884 until 1885 application was made to the War Office with the support of the Commander in Chief Lord Wolseley for medals for Willams and correspondent Bennet Burleigh. Williams had been twice requested to take command of some of the men by senior officers on the spot. The Secretary of War was unable to grant the recognition under the rules of the day but wrote a letter saying that he regretted that this must be his decision. Williams was a recipient of the Queen's Sudan Medal, an award given to British and Egyptian forces which took part in the Sudan campaign between 1896 and 1898. Field Marshall Garnet Wolsey recognized the contributions of Charles Williams on the battlefield. Wolsey said in a speech that from \\"Charles Williams, he had at various times received the greatest possible help in the field.\\" Death Charles Williams died in Brixton, London on 9 February 1904; he was buried in Nunhead Cemetery of London.\\"Famous War Correspondent Dead\\". The New York Times. 10 February 1904. His son, journalist Fred Williams, first learned of his father‚Äôs death on the wire service he was monitoring at his newspaper in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. His funeral was well attended by the press as well as members of the military including Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood. Colleague Henry Nevison wrote a long reflection on Charles Williams. It included, \\"On the field he possessed a kind of instinctive sense of what was going to happen. When I went to big field-days with him he was already an elderly man, and much broken down with the hardships of a war correspondent's life; but he invariably appeared at the critical place exactly at the right moment, and I once heard the Duke of Connaught, who was commanding, say, 'When I see Charlie Williams shut up his telescope, I know it's all over.'... \\"And now he is gone, with his rage, his generosity, his innocent pride, his faithful championship of every friend, and his memories of so many a strange event. His greatest joy was to encourage youth to follow in his steps, and the world is sadder and duller for his going.\\" See also * Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley * Nile Expedition * London Evening Standard * Greco-Turkish War (1897) References Category:1838 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Ulster Scots people Category:People from Coleraine, County Londonderry Category:British male journalists Category:Scottish war correspondents Category:Irish war correspondents Category:Conservative Party (UK) parliamentary candidates ","title":"Charles Frederick Williams"},{"id":"41820346","text":"Richard Krajicek was the defending champion but did not participate.

Village  Eyrarbakki, The museum and church Eyrarbakki Eyrarbakki is a small village in the south coast of Iceland with a long history. It was an important trading place and for centuries the harbor at Eyrarbakki was the main port in the south of the country. When the Danish merchants were allowed to overwinter, for the first time in Iceland in 1765 they built a house in the village center to accommodate the factor and his family. It is a wooden building with characteristics of Danish architecture. For two centuries this house was a center for culture and art, which spread through the county. The commercial building itself (a warehouse), Vesturb√∫√∞ located on the west side was unfortunately torn down in 1950. Fishing became a more important occupation after 1855 when the Danish‚ÄìIcelandic Trade Monopoly was abolished and patterns of settlement changed greatly. The village's heyday was from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century but with improved public transport and occupational opportunities the number of inhabitants decreased. Because of that, many houses from 1890 to 1920 have been preserved; those little houses of the common people characterize the village.Inga L√°ra Baldvinsd√≥ttir. (1998).

It is native to North Arcot, Cuddapah, Kurnool, and the Nagari hills, in eastern Chittoor district, India. It has alternate leaves. Syzygium alternifolium Walp. is a semi-evergreen mass-flowering tree species of dry deciduous forest in the southern Eastern Ghats of India. It is a mass bloomer with flowering during dry season. The floral traits suggest a mixed pollination syndrome involving entomophily and anemophily together called as ambophily. Further, the floral traits suggest generalist pollination system adapted for a guild of pollinating insects. The plant is self-incompatible and obligate out-crosser. The flowers are many-ovuled but only a single ovule forms seed and hence, fruit and seed set rates are the same. Bud infestation by a moth, flower predation by the beetle, Popillia impressipygaand bud and flower mounds significantly limit fruit set rate. The ability of the plant to repopulate itself is limited by the collection of fruits by locals due to their edible nature, short viability of seeds, high seedling mortality due to water stress, nutrient deficiency and erratic rainfall or interval of drought within the rainy season. Therefore, S. alternifolium is struggling to populate itself under various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. (¬© The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Syzygium alternifolium ‚Äì published in 2015. http://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2015-2.RLTS.T50130683A50131435.en in 2015 )documented that S. alternifolium is an endemic and globally endangered species as per the criteria of IUCN. S. alternifolium is a fruit tree of great timber, medicinal and economic importance. Timber is used for making furniture and agricultural implements. In recent years, its population size is declining due to cut down of trees and collection of fruits leaving less possibility for the plant to repopulate itself in its natural area. Keeping this in view, the present study is contemplated to describe the chronological events of pollination biology of S. alternifolium(Wight) Walp. (Myrtaceae). The observational and experimental data collected on the studied aspects are discussed in the light of relevant existing information on other Syzygiumspecies. A population of some individuals of S. alternifolium located in the hill and slopes of Tirumala a part of Seshachalam Hills and this region is declared in 2011 as Seshachalam Biosphere Reserve by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The reserve lies between 13038‚Äù‚Äì13055‚ÄùN & 79007‚Äù‚Äì79024‚ÄùE. It is spread over 4756 km2 in both Kadhapa and Chittoor districts of southern Andhrapradesh. The vegetation is a unique mix of the dry deciduous and moist deciduous types. The elevation ranges from 150‚Äì1,130 m and the terrain undulating with deep forest-covered valleys and characterized by steep slopes, rocky terrain, dry and poor stony soils. The area receives most of the rainfall from northeast monsoon and little from southwest monsoon (Guptha et al. 2012). Flowering: S. alternifolium is a semi- evergreen mass-flowering tree species of dry deciduous forest. Leaf shedding is partial during January‚ÄìMarch. Flower bud initiation occurs in late March while flowering occurs during mid-April to mid-May at population level. All the trees flowered massively The flowering is almost synchronous within the population. The number of flowers opening each day is initially small, but increases rapidly, with a peak mass flowering for a fortnight and then declining rapidly. Leaf flushing begins at the end of flowering and continues into rainy season from June‚ÄìAugust . The shedding of still intact old leaves takes place simultaneously. Fruits : Natural fruit set stands at 11% only .The fertilized flowers grow, mature and ripen within two months. Fruit exhibits different colours - green, light purple, dark purple and violet during growing and maturing phase. It is a globose berry, luscious, fleshy, 25‚Äì30 mm in diameter and edible. It has a combination of sweet, mildly sour and astringent flavor and colours the tongue purple when eaten. The green and light purple fruits are very tasty and sweet while the dark purple and violet ones are sweet and bitter. Each fruit produces a single large seed only. The fruits fall off during late July‚ÄìAugust. The locals were found to collect ripe fruits from trees and fallen fruits from the ground since they are edible and have commercial value seed : One fruit have unique seed ploy embryonic condition. medicinal use : The plant tops are used to cure skin diseases as it has excellent anti-fungal properties (Reddy et al. 1989). The leaves are used in the treatment of liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, infective hepatitis, liver enlargement, jaundice and other ailments of liver and gall bladder. Leaves fried in cow ghee are used as a curry to treat dry cough. A mixture of leaves and mineral oil is used to maintain dark hair and also to promote hair growth by external application to the scalp. Tender shoots, fruits and leaf juice are used to treat dysentery, seeds for diabetes and stem bark for gastric ulcers. Flowers yield honey and possess antibiotic properties. The ripe fruits are used in making squashes and jellies. Fruit juice is used to cure stomach-ache and ulcers while the external application of fruit pulp reduces rheumatic pains (Reddy et al. 1989; Nagaraju& Rao 1990; Rao & Rao 2001; Bakshu 2002; Mohan et al. 2010).

The cemetery was purchased in 1904 to provide affordable burials to Northeast Philadelphia and the surrounding areas. A stone chapel was built on the grounds in 1914. The Lawnview Chapel provided non-denominational services and receiving vaults for bodies awaiting burial. The chapel was converted to the Odd Fellows Cemetery Company's general offices in 1979. When Monument Cemetery was acquired by Temple University in 1956, many remains were moved to Lawnview. Many graves from the former Odd Fellows Cemetery (Philadelphia) were also relocated here.

M. W. Turner. First exhibited in 1834, it is now in the collection of the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. Subject The painting depicts a scene described in Canto 1 of James Thomson's 1748 poem The Castle of Indolence. > Thus easy-rob'd, they to the fountain sped > That in the middle of the court up-threw > A stream, high spouting from its liquid bed, > And falling back again in drizzly dew; > There each deep draughts, as deep he thirsted drew; > It was a fountain of nepenthe rare; > Whence, as Dan Homer sings, huge pleasaunce grew, > And sweet oblivion of vile earthly care; > Fair gladsome waking thoughts, and joyous dreams more fair. It shows an imaginary landscape with Classical buildings and ruins centred on the fountain, around and within which human and winged Cupid-like figures are grouped. History The Fountain of Indolence was first exhibited at the 66th Royal Academy Exhibition at Somerset House in May 1834, to a generally favourable reception. The subsequent history of the painting is unknown until 1882, when it was sold to Thomas Agnew & Sons by H. Lumley. William Henry Vanderbilt then purchased it from Agnew and it remained in the Vanderbilt family until 1958. George W. Vanderbilt loaned it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for an exhibition of British paintings in 1907. In 1958 Lord Beaverbrook was actively seeking a \\"first-rate\\" Turner painting for the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, which was to open the following year in Fredericton. He purchased The Fountain of Indolence from the dealers Leggatt Brothers of London. The painting became central to a dispute that developed in 2004 between the Gallery and the Beaverbrook UK Foundation, which claimed ownership of 133 paintings that had been acquired by Lord Beaverbrook for the Gallery. The Foundation proposed to take back and sell The Fountain of Indolence, which Sotheby's had valued in 2002 at between $16.7 and $25 million in Canadian funds. The Gallery denied that the Foundation owned the paintings, maintaining that they all belonged to the Gallery. Both sides agreed to submit to arbitration, which resulted in a 2007 ruling that 85 of the paintings, including The Fountain of Indolence, belonged to the Gallery, while the remaining 48 belonged to the Foundation. The Foundation appealed the ruling, but it was confirmed by an appeal panel in 2009. The Fountain of Fallacy The gap in the provenance of The Fountain of Indolence between 1834 and 1882 lends credence to the theory that it is identical with The Fountain of Fallacy, a painting which Turner exhibited at the British Institution in 1839, accompanied by four lines from his own poem entitled Fallacies of Hope. > Its Rainbow-dew diffused fell on each anxious lip, > Working wild fantasy, imagining; > First, Science in the immeasurable Abyss of thought, > Measured her orbit slumbering. Contemporary descriptions of the Fountain of Fallacy apply equally well to The Fountain of Indolence. In 1839, the year it was exhibited, Turner wrote to a Mr. Marshall that The Fountain of Fallacy was for sale for 400 guineas and that he had no other painting of that size for sale. No subsequent ownership history of The Fountain of Fallacy is known and the only recorded references to it after its first exhibition are two comments by John Ruskin. According to Turner expert Martin Butlin, in the catalogue raisonn√© The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner, the available evidence indicates \\"that in fact there was ‚Äì and is ‚Äì only one\\" picture.

From Rochdale Interchange it travels through Sudden and Castleton to Middleton bus station, and then continues through Blackley, Harpurhey and Collyhurst to Manchester Shudehill Interchange. It has a sister service 18 which operates on the same route between Manchester and Middleton, and serves Langley. One service per day (17A) serves Stake Hill Industrial Estate. History The service was originally numbered in 1914 when the Manchester Corporation Tramways route from Manchester High Street to Middleton was numbered 17. In 1925, the Middleton tram route was joined to the routes of the former Middleton Electric Traction Company and on 9 August 1925 Manchester corporation trams began to run through to Rochdale displaying the number 17. At 10 miles 1449 yards, this became the longest tram route run by Manchester Corporation Tramways. Rochdale Corporation took part in this joint service although their trams did not display route numbers and showed only a final destination. On 13 November 1932 both Manchester Corporation and Rochdale Corporation buses were substituted for trams on this route, the number 17 was now displayed on the vehicles of both corporations but the Manchester terminus was changed to Cannon Street. The service continued to be run as a joint service by Manchester City Transport and Rochdale Corporation Transport until 1969 when control was transferred to the new SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive. In the 1980/90s it was run by GM Buses before First Greater Manchester took over the company.

The use of sequence methods was initially met with criticism by sociologists who objected to the descriptive and data-reducing orientation of early sequence methods, as well as to a lack of fit between bioinformatic sequence methods and uniquely social phenomena.Levine, Joel H. 2000. ‚ÄúBut What Have You Done for Us Lately?: Commentary on Abbott and Tsay: Sequence Analysis.‚Äù Sociological Methods & Research 29:34-40.Wu, Lawrence L. 2000. ‚ÄúSome comments on ‚ÄòSequence Analysis and Optimal Matching Methods in Sociology: Review and Prospect.‚Äô‚Äù Sociological Methods & Research 29:41-64. Since 2000 there has been a surge of interest in refining sequence methods, leading to some major improvements in social sequence methods.Aisenbrey, S., and A. E. Fasang. 2010. ‚ÄúNew Life for Old Ideas: The ‚ÄòSecond Wave‚Äô of Sequence Analysis: Bringing the ‚ÄòCourse‚Äô Back into the Life Course.‚Äù Sociological Methods & Research 38:420-62.Brzinsky-Fay, Christian, and Ulrich Kohler. 2010. ‚ÄúNew Developments in Sequence Analysis.‚Äù Sociological Methods & Research 38:359-64.Cornwell, Benjamin. 2015. Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press. Many of the methodological developments in social sequence analysis came on the heels of a 2000 special issue devoted to the topic in Sociological Methods & Research, which hosted a debate over methods for comparing sequences. That debate has given rise to several methodological innovations that address limitations of sequence comparison methods that were developed in the 20th century. In a 2006 article in the American Journal of Sociology, David Stark and Balazs Vedre proposed the term \\"social sequence analysis\\" to distinguish the approach from bioinformatic sequence analysis. Sociological Methods & Research organized another special issue on social sequence analysis in 2010, leading to what scholars have dubbed the ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù of sequence analysis.Aisenbrey, S., and A. E. Fasang. 2010. ‚ÄúNew Life for Old Ideas: The ‚ÄòSecond Wave‚Äô of Sequence Analysis: Bringing the ‚ÄòCourse‚Äô Back into the Life Course.‚Äù Sociological Methods & Research 38:420-462. Scholars who have made important contributions to social sequence analysis theory, techniques, data collection, or software development include Andrew Abbott (Chicago), Roger Bakeman (Georgia State University), Peter Bearman (Columbia), Benjamin Cornwell (Cornell), John Gottman (Washington), Laurent Lesnard (Sciences Po), Christian Brzinsky-Fay and Ulrich Kohler (Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin f√ºr Sozialforschung), Cees Elzinga (VU University Amsterdam), Jonathan Gershuny (Oxford), David Heise (Indiana), Raffaella Piccarreta (Universit√† Bocconi), and Katherine Stovel (Washington).  Theoretical foundations  The analysis of social sequence patterns has foundations in sociological theories that emerged in the middle of the 20th century.Cornwell, Benjamin. 2015. Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press. Structural theorists argued that society is a system that is characterized by regular patterns. Even seemingly trivial social phenomena are ordered in highly predictable ways.Parsons, Talcott. 1951. The Social System. Routledge. This idea serves as an implicit motivation behind social sequence analysts‚Äô use of optimal matching, clustering, and related methods to identify common ‚Äúclasses‚Äù of sequences at all levels of social organization, a form of pattern search. This focus on regularized patterns of social action has become an increasingly influential framework for understanding microsocial interaction and contact sequences, or ‚Äúmicrosequences.‚ÄùGershuny, Jonathan. 2003. Changing Times: Work and Leisure in Postindustrial Society. Oxford University Press. This is closely related to Anthony Giddens‚Äôs theory of structuration, which holds that social actors‚Äô behaviors are predominantly structured by routines, and which in turn provides predictability and a sense of stability in an otherwise chaotic and rapidly moving social world.Giddens, Anthony. 1984. The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration. University of California Press. This idea is also echoed in Pierre Bourdieu‚Äôs concept of habitus, which emphasizes the emergence and influence of stable worldviews in guiding everyday action and thus produce predictable, orderly sequences of behavior.Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. Distinction. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. The resulting influence of routine as a structuring influence on social phenomena was first illustrated empirically by Pitirim Sorokin, who led a 1939 study that found that daily life is so routinized that a given person is able to predict with about 75% accuracy how much time they will spend doing certain things the following day.Sorokin, Pitrim A., and Clarence Q. Berger. 1939. Time-Budgets of Human Behavior. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.Sorokin, Pitirim A., and Robert K. Merton. 1937. ‚ÄúSocial Time: A Methodological and Functional Analysis.‚Äù The American Journal of Sociology 42:615-29. Talcott Parsons‚Äôs argument that all social actors are mutually oriented to their larger social systems (for example, their family and larger community) through social roles also underlies social sequence analysts‚Äô interest in the linkages that exist between different social actors‚Äô schedules and ordered experiences, which has given rise to a considerable body of work on synchronization between social actors and their social contacts and larger communities.Cornwell, Benjamin, and Elizabeth Warburton. ‚ÄúWork Schedules and Community Ties.‚Äù Work and Occupations. In press.Gibson, David R. 2005. ‚ÄúConcurrency and Commitment: Network Scheduling and its Consequences for Diffusion.‚Äù Journal of Mathematical Sociology 29:295-323.Lesnard, Laurent. 2008. ‚ÄúOff-Scheduling within Dual-Earner Couples: An Unequal and Negative Externality for Family Time.‚Äù American Journal of Sociology 114:447-90.Presser, H. B. 1994. ‚ÄúEmployment Schedules among Dual-Earner Spouses and the Division of Household Labor by Gender.‚Äù American Sociological Review 59:348-64. All of these theoretical orientations together warrant critiques of the general linear model of social reality, which as applied in most work implies that society is either static or that it is highly stochastic in a manner that conforms to Markov processes.Abbott, Andrew. 1983. ‚ÄúSequences of Social Events.‚Äù Historical Methods 16:129-147.Abbott, Andrew. 1988. ‚ÄúTranscending General Linear Reality.‚Äù Sociological Theory 6:169-186.Abell, Peter. 2004. ‚ÄúNarrative Explanation: An Alternative to Variable-Centered Explanation?‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 30:287-310. This concern inspired the initial framing of social sequence analysis as an antidote to general linear models. It has also motivated recent attempts to model sequences of activities or events in terms as elements that link social actors in non-linear network structures.Bearman, Peter S., and Katherine Stovel. 2000. \\"Becoming a Nazi: A model for Narrative Networks.\\" Poetics 27:69-90.Moody, James, Robert Faris, and Peter S. Bearman. 1999. \\"Blocking the Future: New Solutions for Old Problems in Historical Social Science.\\" Social Science History 23:501-33. This work, in turn, is rooted in Georg Simmel‚Äôs theory that experiencing similar activities, experiences, and statuses serves as a link between social actors.Breiger, Ronald L. 1974. ‚ÄúThe Duality of Persons and Groups.‚Äù Social Forces 53:181-90.Simmel, Georg. [1922] 1955. Conflict and the Web of Group Affiliations, translated and edited by Kurt Wolff. Glencoe, IL: Free Press.  Concepts and methods  Sequence analysis techniques are increasingly used to study a wide variety of sequenced, or ordered, social phenomena. Sequences usually refer to phenomena that are ordered temporally (that is, involving events or states that unfold over a period of time), but a sequence may also reflect spatial order, preference order, hierarchical order, logical order, or other types of order. A variety of techniques have been designed to describe, quantify, and predict these orders.Cornwell, Benjamin. 2015. Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press.  Step-by-step sequence processes  Numerous texts that are devoted to the examination of social sequence phenomena have been published. Some have focused on describing the structure of stochastic microsocial processes - such as turn-taking during conversations (often studied in conversation analysisSacks, Harvey. 1995. Lectures on Conversation. Cambridge, Mass.: Basil Blackwell.Schegloff, Emanuel A. 2007. Sequence Organization in Interaction: A Primer in Conversation Analysis, Vol 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.) - while others have focused on methods for detecting sequential patterns in social behavior.Bakeman, Roger, and John M. Gottman. 1997. Observing Interaction: An Introduction to Sequential Analysis, 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. These approaches usually adopt a \\"step-by-step\\" perspective on sequential phenomena by focusing on how a given social act (e.g., contributing to a group conversation) or phenomenon (e.g., entering a certain occupation) is shaped by a preceding (to shapes a subsequent) event or experience.Abbott, Andrew. 1995. ‚ÄúSequence Analysis: New Methods for Old Ideas.‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 21:93-113. In this work, analysts are interested in particular types of social transitions or first-order dependence between states. Here, researchers often rely on methods that are designed to identify causal processes, especially time-series, Markov, and event-history and duration regression methods.Mayer, Karl Ulrich. 2009. ‚ÄúNew Directions in Life Course Research.‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 35:413-33. Research that adopts step-by-step sequence analysis approaches treats a given transition (for example, the transition from being single to being married) as the outcome of a short causal chain with antecedent causes. This work therefore provides insight into common relationships between social states or statuses.  Whole sequences  A limitation of step-by-step approaches is that they divorce transitions from the larger chain of events that precede and follow those transitions. To draw on an example from the Chicago school of sociology, Robert E. Park‚Äôs ‚Äúrace- relations cycle‚Äù argued that conflict often results when two race groups are exposed to each other. Over time, this often gives way to peaceful coexistence. But this is more likely if inter-group relations involve a gradual development from competition and conflict to accommodation and assimilation. It is less likely if relations fluctuate between positive and negative, as this yields instability and distrust. Only by studying the ‚Äúwhole‚Äù sequence of relations is it possible to understand the social context in which future social phenomena may unfold. The whole sequence provides a richer historical context than information about a single antecedent state can provide. Following this logic, social sequence analysts increasingly view social phenomena as components of larger and more gradual processes, which may or may not exhibit tightly linked sequential elements. This area of social sequence analysis has focused on developing data reduction methods that can detect patterns that underlie complex streams of social phenomena. Andrew Abbott argued that sequence alignment methods in biology and information theory and computer science provided useful models. Both fields had developed combinations of sequence alignment operations to facilitate the comparison of whole sequences.Abbott, Andrew, and John Forrest. 1986. \\"Optimal Matching Methods for Historical Data.\\" Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 16:473-96.Abbott, Andrew. 1990. ‚ÄúA Primer on Sequence Methods.\\" Organization Science 1:373-92.Abbott, Andrew. 1995. ‚ÄúSequence Analysis: New Methods for Old Ideas.‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 21:93-113. Social scientists adapted these methods in the form of optimal matching (OM) analysis, often in conjunction with cluster analysis techniques to aid in the identification of common sequence pattern classes. Sequence alignment methods were first used by social scientists with the goal of identifying commonalities among sequence patterns (for example, common career trajectories and common life-course sequences), categorizing individuals with respect to the classes or ‚Äútypes‚Äù of sequences they exhibited.Abbott, Andrew. 1995. ‚ÄúSequence Analysis: New Methods for Old Ideas.‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 21:93-113.Blair-Loy, Mary.1999. ‚ÄúCareer Patterns of Executive Women in Finance: An Optimal Matching Analysis.‚Äù American Journal of Sociology 104:1346-1397.Brzinsky-Fay, Christian, and Ulrich Kohler. 2010. ‚ÄúNew Developments in Sequence Analysis.‚Äù Sociological Methods & Research 38:359-64. In recent years, sequence analysts have begun to turn to social network analysis methods to depict and measure complex sequence concepts and processes, such as the manner in which sequence states link different social actors together.Bearman, Peter S., and Katherine Stovel. 2000. \\"Becoming a Nazi: A model for Narrative Networks.\\" Poetics 27:69-90.Moody, James, Robert Faris, and Peter S. Bearman. 1999. \\"Blocking the Future: New Solutions for Old Problems in Historical Social Science.\\" Social Science History 23:501-33. right These techniques have proved valuable in a variety of contexts. In life-course research, for example, research has shown that retirement plans are affected not just by the last year or two of one‚Äôs life, but instead how one‚Äôs work and family careers unfolded over a period of several decades. People who followed an ‚Äúorderly‚Äù career path (characterized by consistent employment and gradual ladder-climbing within a single organization) retired earlier than others, including people who had intermittent careers, those who entered the labor force late, as well as those who enjoyed regular employment but who made numerous lateral moves across organizations throughout their careers.Han, Shin-Kap, and Phyllis Moen. 1999a. ‚ÄúClocking out: Temporal Patterning of Retirement.‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôAmerican Journal of Sociology‚Äô‚Äô 105:191-236. In the field of economic sociology, research has shown that firm performance depends not just on a firm‚Äôs current or recent social network connectedness, but also the durability or stability of their connections to other firms. Firms that have more ‚Äúdurably cohesive‚Äù ownership network structures attract more foreign investment than less stable or poorly connected structures.Stark, David, and Bal√°zs Vedres. 2006. ‚ÄúSocial Times of Network Spaces: Network Sequences and Foreign Investment in Hungary.‚Äù American Journal of Sociology 111:1367-1411. Research has also used data on everyday work activity sequences to identify classes of work schedules, finding that the timing of work during the day significantly affects workers' abilities to maintain connections with the broader community, such as through community events.Cornwell, Benjamin, and Elizabeth Warburton. 2014. \\"Work Schedules and Community Ties.\\" Work and Occupations, in press. More recently, social sequence analysis has been proposed as a meaningful approach to study trajectories in the domain of creative enterprise, allowing the comparison among the idiosyncrasies of unique creative careers.Formilan, Giovanni, Simone Ferriani, and Gino Cattani. 2019. A methodological essay on the application of social sequence analysis to the study of creative trajectories. In D√∂rfler, V., and Stierand, M. (eds.). 'Handbook of Research Methods in Creativity', Edward Elgar Publishing. While other methods for constructing and analyzing whole sequence structure have been developed during the past three decades, including event structure analysis,Corsaro, W. A. and D. R. Heise. 1990. ‚ÄúEvent Structure Models from Ethnographic Data.‚Äù Sociological Methodology 20:1-57.Griffin, Larry J. 1993. ‚ÄúNarrative, Event-Structure Analysis, and Causal Interpretation in Historical Sociology.‚Äù American Journal of Sociology 98:1094-1133.Griffin, Larry J., and Robert R.

R. 1989. ‚ÄúModelling Event Structures.‚Äù Journal of Mathematical Sociology 14:139-169. OM and other sequence comparison methods form the backbone of research on whole sequence structures. = Measures = Social sequence analysts are interested in a number of quantifiable properties of ordered social processes, and measured have been developed to reflect these. They include measures of stochasticity or sequential connection (whether and to what extent sequentially adjacent status depend on each other, in a Markovian sense, sequential recurrence (whether specific events or status can occur more than one in the course of a given sequence), the extent to which states are logically prerequisites of each other (an issue that is explored in both event structure analysis and other forms of prerequisite analysis, such as PERT analysis), stationarity (whether the relationship between two sequence states or elements differs depending on where in the sequence that relationship is evaluated), the presence of spells (whether given states or elements are ‚Äústicky‚Äù or have inertia and therefore tend to reoccur and remain once they occur), and homogeneity (whether sequence characteristics like stationarity are similar, and thus whether sequences have the same structure, across subjects that belong to different social groupings, such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status).Gottman, John Mordechai, and Anup Kumar Roy. 1990. Sequential Analysis: A Guide for Behavioral Researchers. New York: Cambridge University Press.Bakeman, Roger, and John M. Gottman. 1997. Observing Interaction: An Introduction to Sequential Analysis, 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.Bakeman, Roger, and Vicen√ß Quera. 2011. Sequential Analysis and Observational Methods for the Behavioral Sciences. Cambridge University Press. = Visualization = An empirical strength of sequence analysis is its emphasis on methods for visualizing otherwise seemingly overly complex social phenomena. A variety of visual aids ‚Äì especially graphs and network diagrams ‚Äì make it easier to detect sequence patterns. One visual aid, known as a transition plot, replace the numbers in the cells of a transition matrix with a visual symbol that reflects the magnitude of the relationship between two given states or phenomena. In this kind of graph, the symbols size or shape varies with the corresponding transition probabilities. Transitions that occur within a set of sequences can also be depicted using a network-like diagram called a state transition diagram, which displays elements as nodes in a network. This way, relationships between elements can be emphasized using graphical aids, such as by adjusting the thickness of lines between states. Transition plots and state transition diagrams are useful for depicting patterns of first-order (Markovian) transitions. They do not provide information about when transitions occur or overall sequence patterns. One visual aid that is useful in both of these respects is the sequence index plot, an example of which is provided on the right side of this page. This kind of graph displays every sequence in the sample. The y-axis includes all of the observations, stacked on top of each other. The x-axis depicts the sequence positions in order. The observations in the sequence index plot are arranged such that cases with the same sequence order are grouped adjacent to each other on the y-axis. A similar graph, called the state distribution graph, can be used to simplify the patterns that are latent in sequence index plots. Like sequence index plots, state distribution graphs array sequence positions in order along the x-axis. The main difference is that the y-axis contains not individual cases, but the prevalence of each element at each position on the x-axis. A special type of state distribution graph is the tempogram, which is designed specifically for temporally ordered sequence data. Finally, sequences are often depicted as networks, in which multiple subjects‚Äô sequences are shown to intersect with each other art specific events or instances. This approach is most common in analyses of sequence networks, especially narrative networks.  Institutional Development  The first international conference dedicated to social-scientific research that uses sequence analysis methods ‚Äì the Lausanne Conference on Sequence Analysis , or LaCOSA ‚Äì was held in Lausanne, Switzerland in June 2012. A second conference (LaCOSA II) was held in Lausanne in June 2016. The Sequence Analysis Association (SAA) was founded at the International Symposium on Sequence Analysis and Related Methods, in October 2018 at Monte Verit√†, TI, Switzerland. The SAA is an international organization whose goal is to organize events such as symposia and training courses and related events, and to facilitate scholars' access to sequence analysis resources.

Berlin's song Irving Berlin's song \\"I Say It's Spinach (And the Hell with It)\\", which appeared in the 1932 musical Face the Music, used the full phrase: \\"Long as I'm yours, long as you're mine/Long as there's love and a moon to shine/I say it's spinach and the hell with it/The hell with it, that's all!\\". Gammon and spinach In Britain in the 19th century, \\"spinach\\" also meant \\"nonsense\\". Dickens uses the phrase \\"gammon and spinach\\" in this sense with Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield (published in 1849) saying \\"What a world of gammon and spinnage it is though, ain't it!\\" (\\"spinnage\\" being a now-obsolete variant of \\"spinach\\"). The same phrase, although with unclear meaning, is also seen in the nursery rhyme \\"A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go\\" (\\"With a rowley, powley, gammon and spinach/heigh ho! says Anthony Rowley\\"). The 1989 second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary lists these two close senses as letters below the same number in the entry for \\"spinach\\". Cassell's Dictionary of Slang gives just the American sense (but listed as extant 1900‚Äì1950) while conversely Partridge gives only the British, perhaps echoing the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary which also does so.

It was disestablished in September 1994.  Squadron History  It had its beginnings on 20 April 1967 as Replacement Airborne Early Warning Squadron 110 (RVAW-110), which had been formed when VAW-11 was broken into six separate squadrons. In spite of its primary role in training, RVAW-110 acquired operational skills through deployments aboard the aircraft carriers , , and during the Vietnam War. Actually RVAW 110 was known as the rag outfit and it was the training arm of the Airborn Early Warning Squadron's. It consisted of E-1B's and E-2A's. It was stationed at NAS North Island before later moving to NAS Miramar.  1960s  In July 1966, VAW-12 received the first E-2A Hawkeye, and was supplying detachments utilizing two different aircraft aboard ten Atlantic Fleet aircraft carriers in addition to training personnel for those detachments. With over 200 officers and 800 enlisted personnel, VAW -12 was reorganized as an Air Wing, and on 1 April 1967, Admiral T.E. Moore, Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, commissioned Carrier Airborne Early Warning Wing Twelve with six operating squadrons.  1970s  The squadron received the second generation E-2B Hawkeye aircraft in 1970, followed by the arrival of the E-2C on 31 May 1980. With the delivery of the first Advanced Radar Processing System (ARPS) aircraft in 1978, RVAW 120 trained Naval Flight Officers (NFOs), Flight Technicians and maintenance personnel in both the APS-120 and APS-125 radars. This continued until 1980 when all east coast VAW squadrons completed transition to the APS-125.  1980s  In May 1980, the 2F110 Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) was delivered and ready for use in early May 1981. The OFT is designed to simulate actual in-flight emergencies and train Replacement Pilots handle such emergencies prior to receiving E-2C training flights. The 15F8B Weapon System Trainer(WST) arrived in October 1984 and was accepted for training on 19 November 1984. This latest arrival provided staff and Replacement NFOs with the latest technology for the Grumman Hawkeye.A VAW-110 E-2C in 1989. In late 1987, VAW-110 began training personnel for the Grumman C-2 Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft. Later it also trained crews for new variants of the E-2C Hawkeye.  1990s  After more than 27 years of service under two designations, VAW-110 was disestablished on 30 September 1994. Its duties were assumed by VAW-120.

It is located along the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail on the banks of the Rouge River in Rouge Park, a city park in Toronto, Ontario. Because of its sensitive archaeological nature, it is not open to the public, nor readily identified in the park. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1991.  Bead Hill site  The Bead Hill site is believed to be one of seven villages established along the north shore of Lake Ontario by the Iroquois in the 1660s. The Bead Hill site was settled temporarily as part of a mid 17th century push by the Iroquois Confederacy north, from their traditional homeland in New York state. The Huron Wendat Confederacy, had once occupied the north shores of Lake Ontario but had moved north toward Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe at the end of the 16th century. Following extensive excavation undertaken in the 1980s it was determined that the Bead Hill site could be the historically documented village of Ganatsekwyagon. Evidence from test excavations suggests that it was home to about 500 to 800 people for about 22 years (1665-1687). Bead Hill was primarily a fur trading outlet, not a military or agricultural site. It was located at the nexus of major trade and transportation routes, including the lakeshore trail that follows modern-day Kingston Road and the historic Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. Bead Hill is adjacent to Glen Rouge Park and Campgrounds.  Ganatsekwyagon  Map showing Ganatsekwyagon and the Rouge Trail to Lake Simcoe, ca. 1673 by Louis Jolliet. The Bead Hill site is believed to contain the archaeological remains of the village of Ganatsekwyagon. French missionaries and explorers arrived at Ganatsekwyagon in 1669. Fran√ßois de Salignac de la Mothe-F√©nelon passed the winter of 1669 in the village, which was the first recorded residence of Europeans in the neighbourhood of Toronto. Fran√ßois-Saturnin Lascaris d'Urf√© may have also spent the winter of 1669 in Ganatsekwyagon with Abb√© F√©nelon but the records are unclear. The village was an important fur trading post and was part of the regional power struggle between the French, British, and Iroquois. The Comte de Frontenac wrote to Louis XIV of France in the fall of 1674 that the Iroquois \\"have given their word not to continue the trade, which as I informed you last year, they had commenced to establish at Ganatsekwyagon, with the Ottawas, which would have absolutely ruined ours by the transfer of the furs to the Dutch.\\" Tensions between the Iroquois and French led to a number of conflicts over the course of the 17th century which are collectively known as the Beaver Wars, which would gravely affect Ganatsekwyagon. In 1687, the French, led by the Marquis de Denonville, began a campaign against the Senecas in northwest New York state. Denonville destroyed most of the Seneca villages in New York. It is unclear whether the French also destroyed Ganatsekwyagon and other Iroquois villages on the North Shore of Lake Ontario in his 1687 campaign, or if the villages were abandoned as the Iroquois on the north shore of Lake Ontario retreated to New York state. Iroquois villages were usually temporary and tended to shift to a new location every 10‚Äì20 years. Therefore, it is not unusual that villages were abandoned. Regardless of the exact reason, following the 1687 campaign the Iroquois were restricted to south of Lake Ontario and Ganatsekwyagon was abandoned. Because early Europeans had difficulty in transcribing First Nations names into European orthographic systems, numerous spelling variations exist. Alternate names for the village included: *Gandat Siagon *Ganatsekwyagon *Ganacheieskiagon *Gandatsetiagon *Gandatsekwyagon *Ganatchekiagon *Gandatsiagon *Ganetsekiagon *Gandatsekiagon *Gandatsdhagon *Kanatiochtiage *Ganastiquiagon *Gandalskiagon *Le Portage de Toronto *Toronto Carrying Place *Toronto Portage  Early descriptions of Bead Hill  William Brown, who was renting a saw mill on the Rouge River, was one of the first individuals to describe Bead Hill in 1849. After his employees found the site and he inspected it, he wrote, \\"There were pieces of broken pottery, broken guns, and flint heads of some very handsome tobacco pipes which the men brought away. They intended to go again ... But I persuaded them to allow the dead to rest in peace, going, however, to view the place myself; and I found that about 40 acres had been appropriated as a place of sepulture, and that no grave had been deeper than about two feet from the surface. The whole of the steep bank of the river had been used, and the graves being one above another in the hillside, they looked like steps from the top to the bottom.\\" In 1885, C. Blackett Robinson published A History of Toronto and County of York, which described artifacts found \\"near the mouth of the Rouge River, where the site of what was once a considerable Indian village was indicated by the remains of the logs which formed a wooden palisade surrounding their habitations.\\" Some of these artifacts, the account continued, \\"have all the characteristics of the stone age, and mixed with the rude weapons and implements of 'native industry' are those of copper and iron, and also glass beads, which were probably obtained by intercourse with the early French voyageurs and traders ... A few yards from the site of the village a number of graves containing aboriginal remains were discovered.\\"  Iroquois villages on the north shore of Lake Ontario  By the late 1660s various Five Nation Iroquois had established seven villages along the shores of Lake Ontario where trails led off into the interior. In addition to Ganatsekwyagon at the mouth of the Rouge River, the following settlements have been identified by historian Percy James Robinson: * Ganneious - on the site of present-day Napanee * Kente - on the Bay of Quinte * Kentsio - on Rice Lake * Ganaraske - on the site of present-day Port Hope * Teiaiagon - on a hillside overlooking the Humber River, today's Baby Point neighbourhood in Toronto * Quinaouatoua (or Tinawatawa) - Near modern-day Hamilton References Category:History of Toronto Category:Scarborough, Toronto Category:Archaeological sites in Canada Category:Seneca tribe Category:First Nations history in Ontario Category:Iroquois populated places Category:First Nations sites in Toronto ","title":"Bead Hill"},{"id":"41820960","text":"Louvain Coop√©rationThe official denomination of the NGO as published in the Belgian official journal is \\"Louvain Coop√©ration au D√©veloppement\\" (abbreviated LD). is a Belgian International non-governmental organization (INGO) located in the university city of Louvain-la-Neuve.

Many were built by amateur groups. Design and development In 1932 the Gr√ºne Post, a popular German Sunday newspaper, approached Alexander Lippisch, a successful glider designer, for plans of a club glider that they would make available to their one million readers. The resulting simple single seat aircraft, named after the paper, was broadly similar to his earlier Pr√ºfling design of six years earlier. The performance of the two types was also similar. The Gr√ºne Post had a constant chord, unswept wooden wing built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge, which was plywood skinned. Its tips were slightly angled outwards behind the leading edge, where the tips of the broad ailerons were cropped. It was supported over the fuselage on a short chord, thin, enclosed pylon, its leading edge vertical under the forward wing and sloping down to the upper fuselage under the trailing edge of the wing. The forward half of the fuselage was built on a wide V-section platform, Z√∂gling-style but with sloping side covering, onto which the controls and the single seat, with its back on the wing pylon, were mounted. The short nose section containing the cockpit opening could be removed for access or display. From each side of the platform a pair of streamlined, parallel lift struts braced the wing at about mid-span. Behind it the fuselage had a simple rectangular section structure. The Gr√ºne Post had a near rectangular horizontal tail of constant chord and slightly angled tips. A straight tapered, narrow fin was placed far enough aft that the rudder hinge line was almost beyond the elevator trailing edge; the rudder was also straight tapered, square tipped and reached down to the keel. The Gr√ºne Post landed on a rubber sprung skid on the bottom of the fuselage platform, assisted by a small tail skid. The first flight was in 1932 or 1933. Many Gr√ºne Posts were amateur built from the plans available from the newspaper. The plans spread widely: two Gr√ºne Posts were built in Hungary and one in Latvia.

Its original Mahican name is unknown. However, it was known as \\"Aries Lake\\" prior to 1897, when it was renamed for the family of Harmon Snyder, who had settled at Aires Lake during the American Revolution. Members of the Snyder family still live there. Local legend has it that Aires Lake was much smaller and became Snyder's Lake when the Snyder family dammed the lake's only outlet at the northeast corner of the lake, flooding a much larger land area. The settled area was formerly a mix of agricultural and residential zoning, with a large portion consisting of farmland. In the early 2000's the landscape started shifting to almost entirely residential zoning. Many residents are traditional outdoorsmen, who still enjoy the abundance of local hunting and fishing. A 15 minute commute to downtown Albany allows for many career opportunities. There is no official government within the area, as it is governed and represented by the town of North Greenbush.

History A view of the parochial church of S√£o Salvador In 1499, King D. Afonso V made Gomes Martins de Lemos the master of Trofa. In 1522, Duarte de Lemos ordered the construction of a funerary chapel in the parish of Trofa. Between 1536 and 1539, the parietal tombs and statuary were constructed. Between the 18th and 19th century the main body of the church was constructed. In 1978, one of the legs of the \\"praying\\" statue was encountered broken. On 1 June 1992, the property fell under the authority of the IPPARInstituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico (Portuguese Institute for Architectural Patrimony), by decree 106F/92 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1A, 126). A conditional approval was obtained on 16 November 1998, from the civil parish authority of Trofa and municipality of √Ågueda, to expand and redefine the size of the churchyard. In 2006, the parochial church of Trofa do Vouga was closed to the public since August, in order to precede with work to conserve, restore and promote the religious heritage; work began on 17 August 2006, then concluded in April 2007.

Based in Jerusalem and established in 2011, Mekimi is not a sectorial organization yet the majority of families seeking help from Mekimi come from the National Religious segment. Mekimi works with the families and professionals such as lawyers, accountants, mortgage brokers, and even marriage counselours to restructure family debt which has so far included cases between 20 000NIS to 500 000NIS. One of Mekimi's unique features is to galvanize the community around the family in financial crisis and without the community knowing specifically who is being helped. Mekimi raises money to help the family settle debts from banks, lenders and even loan sharks and also teaches them to reduce usage or altogether stop using credit cards, cheques. The service is given free of charge. In April 2014, Petah Tikva was the location of Mekimi' opening a second branch. israel Livman, formerly the vice- president of operations at Paamonim, founded Mekimi in memory of both his father who had died and a brother who had been killed, and now serves as the organization's director. Livman explains the motivation behind forming a similar organization in that while Paamonim helps the vast majority of families that approach it, it ends up turning away some hard cases which it does not have the resources to assist. Livman took on the challenge to help those extreme cases. Some of the families get stuck in the vicious downward cycle of black market moneylenders and in these cases, Livman might meet with them in order to restructure and mediate a solution to pay off the loan. Mekimi has publicly called for banks to resist tempting customers to go further into debt and for families to make do with what they have even if it means selling a car or moving to a smaller home.

History In 1220, during the Inquiries of King D. Afonso II, references exist for two Belazaimas: :Villam de Alvarim et de balsamia et de alia Balsamia e a quintam de Villarinho e de Ballasayma...\\". In the August 1485, King D. John II donated the territory to the Infanta D. Joana, where he specified that the villa of Ballasayma with all its royal rights/privileges, rents and tributes, reiterating in 1487 his donation of the estates of Vilarinho and Balezaima. The church was reconstructed sometime in the 18th century, with the execution of the retables and paintings occurring in the mid-century. These painting in wood are located in the middle of the lateral arches, alongside the collateral arches. On 21 December 1999, there was a proposal to classify the Church Factory, resulting in the opening of a process by the vice-president of IPPAR (fore-runner of IGESPAR) on 7 February 2000. The DRCoimbra proposed the classification church as an Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest) on 19 August 2002, but the suggestion was revised by DRRCentro on 5 August 2010, to that of Monumento de Interesse P√∫blico (Monument of Public Interest). On 13 October 2010, the National Council for Culture solicited a clarification on the classification proposals, that was clarified on 4 November. The seesaw between organizations continued with 2 January 2012 proposal by the DRRCentro to advance with the classification, given a report on the level of conservation. On 25 September, an announcement was published (13458/2012, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 2, 186) with a decision to classify the church as an Monumento de Interesse P√∫blico and establishing a special protection zone. Architecture The church is located in an urban area, in between residential buildings, with a paved churchyard, delimited by wall and flanked in the north, west and south. Access to the churchyard is to the right, fenced-in by a grade and gate in iron, while to the northwest is an uncharacteristic two-story annex building for catechism. To the east is a pillory with Latin cross with three orders of plinths over rectangular base. On the southern flank, is the building of the social centre, east by the Rua da Igreja and agricultural pastures, and north by another building, followed away by the Junta de Freguesia.

The faculty in the Summer Institute volunteer their time to support the advancement of underrepresented groups.  Mentoring Component  The highly selective program differs from other leadership programs largely because of its intensive mentoring program. Proteges meet for one week in the summer and are then paired with a sitting president or chancellor for the following year. The mentor and protege meet weekly by phone, communicate by email, and the protege shadows the mentor on his or her campus. The initiative has been highly successful with sixty proteges appointed as president or chancellor in the programs fifteen years.

This can be compared to the true azimuth obtained by astronomical observation to determine the magnetic declination, the amount by which the reading of a ship's compass must be adjusted to obtain an accurate reading. Azimuth compasses were important in the period before development of the reliable chronometers needed to determine a vessel's exact position from astronomical observations. Theory The azimuth is the angle formed between a reference direction (North) and a line from the observer to a point of interest projected on the same plane as the reference direction In navigation, the true azimuth of a heavenly body is the arc of the horizon between the point where a vertical plane containing the observer and the heavenly body intersects the horizon and the direction of true north. The magnetic azimuth is the arc between the point on the horizon below the heavenly body and the direction of magnetic north. When the latitude and date are known, the bearing of the sun at sunrise or sunset relative to true north can be readily determined. If the sun is observed at some time between sunrise and sunset, its altitude must also be recorded to calculate the true azimuth. The true azimuth may be compared to the magnetic azimuth to find the magnetic declination, the angle between the direction that the compass indicates as north and the true north direction. Compass designs An azimuth compass is a magnetic compass where the circumference of the card is divided into 360 degrees. It has two sights, diametrically opposite each other, through which the sun, planet or star is viewed. The sun is typically observed when the sun's center is about one solar diameter above the horizon. Typically the compass will have a stop in the side of the box, which the observer pushes when the sun is lined up in the sights. This fixes the compass card, from which the magnetic azimuth or amplitude can be read. The sights may consist of two vanes, one with a narrow slit and the other with a wider slit bisected by a thread. The observer looks towards the sun, seen through a dark glass, lining up the thread and the narrow slit on the center of the sun. Another arrangement has a vertical bar on one vane and a slit bisected by a thread on the other. The instrument is aligned with the sun when the shadow of the thread falls on the vertical bar. Yet another design has a magnifying glass on one vane that focuses the rays of the sun on the opposite vane. Meridional azimuth compasses included a universal equatorial sundial. By setting the date and latitude, the true north and the magnetic variation could be read from the instrument without the need for calculation. With the iron vessels introduced in the 19th century the azimuth compass would be mounted on a pedestal at a neutral point where the readings would not be affected by magnetism of the vessel. Applications A map showing lines of equal magnetic declination in January 2015 Early navigators in the northern hemisphere could calculate latitude relatively easily when the night sky was clear by observing the elevation of Polaris, a star that is very close to the north celestial pole. However, calculating longitude was impossible until chronometers that could keep time accurately throughout a long voyage were developed. In 1688 King Philip III of Spain (1578‚Äì1621) offered a large reward to anyone who could find a practical solution to determining longitude. A novel approach, apparently originating with the Jesuit missionary Christoforo Borri, was to create charts that mapped points of equal magnetic declination. With an accurate reading of the latitude and the magnetic declination the navigator could determine their longitude using the chart. A drawback to this approach is that magnetic variations change over time, so the charts would need constant revision. The azimuth compass still had great value in letting the master of a ship determine how far the magnetic compass varied from true north, so he could set a more accurate course while following a line of constant latitude or using dead reckoning to navigate. In 1795 a British First Rate ship would have up to eight compasses, of which one was an improved steering compass. This azimuth compass may have been specialized for the purpose of measuring magnetic variation through taking readings from stars, and used to determine the accuracy of the other compasses. Instruments An example of an azimuth compass. The visors of unequal height allow sighting of objects above the horizon. An azimuthal compass was described in 1736, but the inventor was not named. Azimuth compasses were sometimes large, with a brass case mounted in gimbals containing the rose, and sights on top of the case. Walter Hayes, Richard Glynne and Benjamin Ayres (died c. 1775) made accurate large azimuth compasses. Henry Gregory (1744‚Äì1782) had an establishment known as \\"The Azimuth Compass\\" in Leadenhall Street, London. He supplied an azimuth compass designed by Gowin Knight to Joseph Banks for the voyage of commanded by Captain James Cook in 1772. The instrument cost ¬£80.0.0. On 6 February 1808 the American sealer Topaz, commanded by Captain Mayhew Folger, arrived at Pitcairn Island to take on fresh water. There he found thirty-five survivors of the mutiny on HMS Bounty led by John Adams, who gave Folger 's azimuth compass and chronometer.

Arming himself with a hand axe from a woodpile near his regiment's camp, Brown charged into battle to the cheers of his men. During the hand-to-hand combat he compelled the surrender of a Confederate officer, whose sword and pistol Brown seized before making the Confederate a prisoner.Richard Rollins, editor, Pickett's Charge: Eyewitness Accounts at the Battle of Gettysburg, 2005, page 260Albert Lawson, War Anecdotes and Incidents of Army Life: Reminiscences from Both Sides of the Conflict Between the North and the South, How a Hatchet Replaced a Sword, 1888, pages 45-46 During the battle Brown suffered head trauma from the concussion of an artillery shell which exploded near him as he rendered aid to a member of the regiment who had lost a leg during the fighting. Despite the hearing loss and other effects from the shell's concussion, Brown refused to leave the field, telling the regimental surgeon that he would continue to fight unless the entire regiment was ordered to retreat.John M.

This provides evidence that there was a closer link between early nonconformist chapels and public houses than is often thought and that the cause commenced very early in the history of Aberaman as an industrial settlement when the local seams of the locality began to be exploited by Crawshay Bailey and David Davis, Blaengwawr. The chapel was built in 1849. 121 members were released from Calfaria, Aberdare to establish the church. Later that year David Bevan Jones (Dewi Elfed) was called to minister the church. Jones apparently fell out with Price and the Baptist denomination and sought to associate the chapel with the Latter Day Saints. Price initiated legal action to reclaim the building and eventually led a march to the church which led to the minister being turned out in November 1851. Following this turbulent episode, William Jones, an assistant preacher at Calfaria, Aberdare was ordained as minister at Gwawr. It can be assumed that this was arranged by Price so that he could prevent a recurrence of the previous difficulties. Jones was followed by another minister, D. Evans of Llaneurwg, who also remained for only a short period. In 1858, the Rev T Nicholas of Pembrey accepted a call to minister the church and was inaugurated on 26 December 1858. He remained at Gwawr until his death on 9 November 1865. In 1859, there were 270 members. During his ministry, new churches were formed as branches of Gwawr at Abercwmboi in 1860 and Seion, Cwmaman in 1861. In 1866 the Rev Morgan Phillips of Tabor, Brynmawr accepted a call to minister Gwawr and was inaugurated on 30 April. By this time the original building proved to be to small as the population of Aberaman grew rapidly. Gwawr was rebuilt in 1870 at a cost of ¬£1,707 and now had capacity for 850 people.was established as minister. Phillips resigned his ministry on 6 September 1874 and died soon afterwards. The pastorate of Thomas Davies, 1875‚Äì1908 Thomas Davies was minister for 33 years, from 1875 until 1908. Davies was born in Llantood, Pembrokeshire, in 1845 and began his career as a schoolmaster at Blaenffos near his birthplace. He was persuaded to enter the ministry and was ordained at his first church in Llangynidr, Breconshire, where he remained for nine years. In 1875, he accepted a call to Aberaman as a successor to Morgan Phillips. Davies became a prominent figure in the Baptist denomination, served as secretary of the East Glamorgan Baptist association and wrote under the pseudonym, 'Didymus'. Thomas Davies remained at Aberaman for the remainder of his career and died in 1908 at the age of 62. A vestry was added during his ministry, in 1890, at a cost of ¬£900. The pastorate of W. T. Francis, 1909‚Äì  W. T. Francis came to Aberaman from Aberduar, Llanybydder. He remained for only four years before moving to Calfaria, Llanelli. Following his departure the Rev T. Lloyd Rees accepted a call and was inaugurated on 21 February 1915. 20th century In 1916 there were 205 members and in 1925, 189. After the departure of T. Lloyd Rees in 1918, D.G. Harries became minister in 1920 and served until his death at a comparatively young age in 1941. J. Gwyn Davies was minister from 1945 until 1957 and was succeeded by T. Arfon Jones in 1960. Later history By 1955 the membership had fallen to 66 with a further decline to 42 by 1963. In 1970 the congregation moved from the original building to the former Hebron Calvinistic Methodist church and the old Gwawr was demolished.

She was one of the leading Irish two-year-old fillies of 2008, when she won three of her five races including the Debutante Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes. She recorded her most important win when taking the Irish 1,000 Guineas on her three-year-old debut, but was beaten in her three subsequent races. Background Again is a bay mare with a white blaze bred in Ireland by Southern Bloodstock, a breeding operation associated with the Coolmore Stud. She was sired by Danehill Dancer, the Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland in 2009, whose other progeny have included Mastercraftsman and Choisir. Again's dam Cumbres, was an unraced half-sister of the multiple Group One winner Montjeu. During her racing career, the detail of Again's ownership changed from race to race: she was alternately described as being owned by Michael Tabor and by a partnership of Tabor and Susan Magnier. She was trained by David Wachman, the son-in-law of Coolmore's head John Magnier, at Goolds Cross in County Tipperary. Racing career=2008: two-year-old season Again made her racecourse debut at Roscommon Racecourse on 7 July 2008, when she finished unplaced in a seven furlong maiden race. Three weeks later she started 5/2 favourite for a similar event over one mile at the Curragh and took the lead in the closing stages to win by half a length from Tingling. Again was moved up sharply in class when she contested the Group Two Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs on heavy ground at the Curragh. Starting at odds of 9/2 and ridden by Johnny Murtagh she took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by three lengths from Oui Say Oui. Two weeks later, Again was made the 6/4 favourite for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes over the same course and distance. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, she moved up to dispute the lead in the final quarter mile and held on to win by half a length from Shimah. On her final appearance of the year, the filly was sent to France to contest the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp Racecourse. She started second favourite but was never in contention and finished fourteenth of the sixteen runners behind Proportional. 2009: three-year-old season Again made her three-year-old debut in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh on 22 May, in which she was ridden by Murtagh and started 5/2 favourite against fifteen opponents. She was towards the rear of the field in the early stages before moving up into third place in the final quarter mile. In the final furlong she produced a strong late run along the rail to take the lead in the final strides and won by half a length from the British-trained Lahaleeb. Her win gave Wachman his first success in a Classic race, after the race he said that Again had \\"always been a nice horse, and I‚Äôm lucky to have her\\". At Royal Ascot in June, Again was matched against the English 1000 Guineas winner Ghanaati in the Group One Coronation Stakes. Ridden by Ryan Moore, she started slowly and lost any chance when hampered in the straight, finishing seventh behind Ghanaati. In September, Again raced against older fillies and mares in the Matron Stakes and finished third behind Rainbow View and Heaven Sent. On her final appearance, Again started a 20/1 outsider for the Group One Prix de l'Op√©ra at Longchamps and finished seventh of the nine runners behind Shalanaya.

The church, designed by engineer Giuseppe Gualandi, is sometimes referred as the little Milan Cathedral, due to its rich neogothic style.  History  In 1893, the Missionary of the Sacred Heart Victor Jou√´t, born in Marseille, founded in Rome the Associazione del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio delle Anime del Purgatorio (Italian for \\"Association of the Sacred Heart of the Suffrage of the Purgatory Souls\\"), having the aim to spread the worship to the Sacred Heart and to the Virgin Mary. The former oratory of the Association rose in Via dei Cosmati; a second one, used between 1896 and 1914, was located in Lungotevere Prati, into a ground that the founder had bought in order to build a bigger church, whose foundation stone was blessed in 1894 by Joseph-Jean-Louis Robert, Bishop of Marseille. The construction of the new church began in 1908 and the design was committed to engineer Giuseppe Gualandi, who chose a style inspired by French Gothic architecture. In 1914, the Association moved to the church of St. Joseph Calasanz in Via Cavallini, since the old chapel was partially demolished in order to allow the completion of the new church; the building, completed in 1917, was blessed and opened to worship on November 1 of the same year. The parish was founded on December 10. On May 17, 1921 the church was consecrated by Pietro Benedetti, Archbishop of Tyre, its first vicar. Pope John Paul II visited the church on February 1, 1998.  Description = Fa√ßade  A detail of the fa√ßade Sacro Cuore di Ges√π in Prati rises in Lungotevere Prati, between Via Ulpiano and Via Paolo Mercuri, close to the Palace of Justice. The fa√ßade with salients, entirely made with reinforced concrete, underlines the internal subdivision into three naves thanks to six quadrangular piers, each surmounted by a spire. In the lower part there are three portals, whose embrasure is decorated by little columns made of red Verona marble; each portal is surmounted by a wimperg and decorated with a marble lunette hosting a bas-relief: the central lunette portrays the Souls of Purgatory, the one on the right the Deposition of Christ and the one on the left the Resurrection of Christ; the wimperg above the central portal shows a high-relief portraying the Sacred Heart of Jesus between two Angels. In correspondence to each of the side naves there is a high triphora, while the central nave corresponds to a big esaphora including a rose window showing a richly decorated trestle. The fa√ßade ends aloft with a thin octagonal bell tower: it is surmounted by a cross that hosts an earth-shaped ex-voto, donated by Victor Jou√´t. The decorations of the fa√ßade, formerly made with artificial stone, has been replaced, starting from 1960+, by statues made with St. Gotthard stone, though identical to the original ones. They include gothic-inspired architectural features and nineteen statues of saints, personally chosen by Pope Pius X; they are positioned within recesses above the slopes of the central nave (from the left: St. Augustine, St. Peter Apostle, St. Joseph, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, St. John Evangelist, St. Paul Apostle and St. Odo of Cluny), of the nave on the right (from the left: St. Victor, St. Francis of Assisi and St. Nicholas of Tolentino), of the nave on the left (from the left: St. Francis Xavier, St. Dominic of Guzm√°n and St. Michael Archangel) and close to the six pillars, placed on shelves (from the left: St. Bernard of Clairvaux, St. Gregory the Great, St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, St. Catherine of Genoa, St. Anthony of Padua and St. Patrick.  Interior  Interior The interior of the church, slightly rotated in respect with the axis of the fa√ßade, has three naves with six bays each, covered with a groin vault and divided by pointed arches which rest on polystyle pillars with carved capitals; the pillars and the ribs of the vaults are decorated with stripes of gray stone and red bricks, while the floor shows inserts of red Verona marble. The external light enters from the three windows of the fa√ßade, as well as from eighteen biphoras with stained glass windows; the ones in the nave on the right show, starting from the entrance, St. Frances of Rome and St. Catherine of Genoa, St. Bridget and St. Ambrose, St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ephrem and St. Peter Damian, St. Joan of Arc and St. Sebastian, St. Robert Bellarmine and St. Francis of Sales. Along the two side naves, in correspondence of each span, there is a barely deep, rectangular chapel; the second and fourth chapel of each side host a marble altar, while the other ones show fine wooden neo- gothic confessionals. The first altar on the right is dedicated to St. Michael Archangel and is surmounted by an altar piece by Alessandro Catani portraying the Saint; the predella shows seven musician Angels, painted by the daughters of the artist. The following altar is dedicated to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque and is surmounted by a triptych by Giovan Battista Conti portraying the Vision of the Heart of Jesus to Margaret Maria Alacoque (1923), while the predella shows, from the left, St. Jeanne-Fran√ßoise Fr√©miot de Chantal, St. Margaret Maria Alacoque surrounded by the souls of the Purgatory, St. Margaret Maria Alacoque shows to the novices the worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. Francis of Sales. The first altar on the left is dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua: the altar piece, by Giuseppe Burgo, portrays St. Anthony as the saint of charity and rests on a predella showing, from the left, St. Gerolamo Emiliani, St. Vincent de Paul, St. Camillus de Lellis, Jesus the Saviour parting the bread, Blessed Anna Maria Taigi, St. Elizabeth of Hungary and St. Louise de Marillac. The following altar is dedicated to St. Gregory the Great and is surmounted by an altar piece inspired to the legend of the monk Justus: it shows St. Gregory the Great celebrating mass for the soul of the monk Justus and, above it, the Blessed Spirit and, on the top of the frame, the sculpture God the Father; the predella shows, from the left, St. Michael Archangel, St. Gregory the Great and poor people, St. Gregory the Great dictates the Gregorian chant and St. Gabriel Archangel; the work is by Giovan Battista Conti. Funeral monument of Monsignor Pietro Benedetti In the last span of the side nave on the left, placed against the wall, rises the Funeral monument to Monsignor Pietro Benedetti (1932), made with polychrome marbles, completed by a bronze \\"Piety\\" in the lower part and a bronze bust of the same Bishop in the higher. Both side naves end with a polygonal chapel, which contains a marble altar whose slab rests on little columns and closed by a balustrade decorated with trilobate arches. The chapel in the nave on the right is dedicated to St. Joseph and corresponds to the second oratory of the Association of the Sacred Heart of the Suffrage of the Purgatory Souls; its altar is surmounted by an altar piece by Giuseppe Brugo portraying St. Joseph with Jesus as a child between two angels, St. Teresa and St. Bernard. The chapel on the opposite side is dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and the altar is surmounted by the altar piece by Francesco Notari Our Lady of the Rosary between angels, St. Dominic of Guzm√°n and St. Catherine of Siena; the frame is decorated with God the Father (in the middle) and the Annunciation (on both sides), while the painted predella shows on the left St. Zita, St. Agnes and St. Cecilia, on the right St. Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori, St. Bernardino of Siena and St. Cyril of Alexandria; the tabernacle is decorated with the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The frame was designed by Notari and manufactured by carpenter Giuseppe Fallaci, wood carver Arturo Grossi and gilder Giovacchino Corsi. The central nave ends with a deep polygonal apse, enlightened by two orders of ogival windows; in the centre of the apse rises the marble high altar, decorated with gilded bronzes and surmounted by the tabernacle Behind the altar there is the altar piece The Sacred Heart and the Souls of Purgatory, by Giuseppe and Alessandro Catani.  Pipe organ  The organ in the counter-fa√ßade Close to the counter-fa√ßade, above a wooden cantoria whose bulwark is decorated with a series of ogival arches, rises the pipe organ, built by Fabbrica Organi Ruffatti after 1960+ in place of a former one, coming from the church of Santa Brigida.  Museo delle anime del Purgatorio  Next to the church, within the sacristy, is the Museo delle anime del Purgatorio (\\"Museum of the Souls of Purgatory\\"), whose entry is a door in the sixth span of the nave on the right. On July 2, 1897 a miraculous occurrence happened in the Chapel of the Association of the Sacred Heart of Purgatory Souls' Suffrage, when, during a fire, the soul of a deceased appeared to the attendance and his effigy was impressed on the wall; hereafter Victor Jou√´t decided to search for testimonies (documents and looms) about the appearances of the souls of Purgatory and to collect them in a museum close to the church.

It is useful in bioremediation for its ability to reductively dehalogenate chlorinated alkanes.  Discovery and Description  Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens cells are Gram-negative, non-motile, irregular cocci that are 0.3‚Äì0.6 Œºm in diameter. There is no evidence of pathogenicity. They are mesophiles that can grow in a temperature range of 20‚Äì34 ¬∞C with their optimum temperature range being 28‚Äì34 ¬∞C. They grow best in pH 7-7.5 (pH range 6‚Äì8, although it was isolated from groundwater of pH 5.1). Growth has been observed in salt concentrations from 0.1‚Äì2% NaCl with optimum growth at ‚â§1%. GC-content reported in characterization of D. lykanthroporellens is 53.8% as determined by HPLC; however, as determined by genomic analysis, the GC-content is 55.04%. D. lyankanthroporepellens does not form spores. Resistance to the antibiotics ampicillin and vancomycin has been observed. D. lykanthroporepellens is strictly anaerobic and uses hydrogen as an electron donor. It has been cultured in an anaerobic basal medium at 30 ¬∞C in the dark. It is able to reductively dehalogenate aliphatic alkanes (non- aromatic alkanes) such as 1,2,3-trichloropropane (reduces it to allyl chloride which abiotically transforms in the presence of water to allyl alcohol). Two strains (BL-DC-9T and BL-DC-8) were isolated from a Superfund site in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2009 by Moe, Yan, Nobre, Costa, and Rainey‚Äîresearchers at Louisiana State University and the University of Coimbra (Coimbra, Portugal). A Superfund site is an abandoned site that contains hazardous waste. This site was contaminated with chlorinated solvents. The genus name Dehalogenimonas reflects its ability to dehalogenate chlorinated alkanes. The species name lykanthroporepellens comes from lykanthropos meaning werewolf and re-pellens meaning repelling. The species name refers to the garlic smell of the bacteria when cultured. Some folklore states that garlic can be used to repel creatures like werewolves and vampires.  Phylogeny  There are six classes within the phylum Chloroflexi: Chloroflexi, Anaerolinea, Caldilinea, Dehalococcoidia (previously known informally as Dehalococcoidetes), Ktedonobacteria, and Thermomicrobia. D. lykanthroporepellens is in the class Dehalococcoidia. Chloroflexi consists of the green non-sulfur bacteria which are anoxygenic phototrophs (do not produce oxygen during photosynthesis) that use either H2 or H2S as an electron donor.1\\\\. Madigan, M. T., Martinko, J. M., Stahl, D. A., & Clark, D. P. (2012). Brock Biology of Microorganisms (13 ed.). San Francisco: Pearson Education Inc. However D. lykanthroporepellens uses polychlorinated aliphatic alkanes as the electron acceptor. Chloroflexi are the deepest branching (oldest) anoxygenic phototrophs on the tree of life. Many of the species in Chloroflexi are thermophilic however Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens is a mesophile. The Oscillochloris (Class Chloroflexi) are also mesophilic. Despite this relationship, D. lykanthroporepellens is more closely related to the Dehalococcoides (class Dehalococcoidia) with 90% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. D. lykanthroporepellens also differ from other species in the phylum Chloroflexi in that they are not filamentous.  Metabolism  Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens is a chemotrophic organism that uses H2 as an electron donor and polychlorinated aliphatic alkanes as an electron acceptor. These molecules include 1,2,3-trichloropropane, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane. However, there are several chlorinated alkanes that it cannot reduce, such as 1-chloropropane and 2-chloropropane. It uses these compounds as electron acceptors in dihaloelimination reactions. In dihaloelimination the electron donor (H2 in this case) is used to remove two halogens from adjacent carbons that are double bonded. 1,2,3-trichloropropane is reduced to allyl chloride by D. lykanthroporepellens, and further transformed abiotically to allyl alcohol in the presence of water (other abiotic reactions can occur). The carbon source has not been determined for this species but other organisms within Chloroflexi use CO2 as a carbon source.  Genome  Although two strains of D. lykanthroporepellens have been isolated and characterized, only the type strain BL-DC-9T has had the genome sequenced. Therefore, when referring to D. lykanthroporepellens in this section, all information is only verified for BL-DC-9T. D. lykanthroporepellens has a circular chromosome consisting of 1,686,510 bp and a G-C content, based on genomic analysis, of 55.04%. The genome was sequenced using both Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms, more specifically an Illumina shotgun library, a 454 draft library, and a paired end 454 library. Illumina sequence data was assembled and combined with assembled 454 data. Initial assembly contained 64 contigs (a set of overlapping DNA) in 1 scaffold (a set of overlapping contigs with known gap lengths). Genes were annotated using a combination of automated and manual curation. 1,771 genes were predicted, in which 1,720 were protein-coding genes and 51 were RNAs. Putative function was designated to nearly 70% of the protein-coding genes. Interest in D. lykanthroporepellens stems from its ability to degrade polychlorinated aliphatic alkanes into nonhazardous products. The catalysis of reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated compounds is dependent on the presence and expression of genes coding for reductive dehalogenase enzymes. These genes are organized in rdhAB operons, which encode the RdhA protein (reductive dehalogenase) and the RdhB protein (membrane anchor). D. lykanthroporepellens was shown to have several rdhA and rdhB genes in the chromosome. Furthermore, D. lykanthroporepellens has a prophage region containing 45 hypothetic proteins, which accounts for roughly 4% of the chromosome. An additional ~4.3% of the genome of D. lykanthroporepellens is made up of insertion sequence elements, which encode for 74 full or truncated transposases. Thus, horizontal gene transfer appears to be a potential mechanism for the adaptation of D. lykanthroporepellens to its ecological niche.  Application in Bioremediation  Polychlorinated aliphatic C2 and C3 alkanes (ethanes and propanes with at least two chlorine substituents) are industrially important chemical intermediates globally produced on a massive scale. Due to spills and past inappropriate disposal methods, these chlorinated compounds are prevalent groundwater and soil contaminants throughout the US and around the world. Bioremediation approaches that rely on the action of anaerobic, reductively- dehalogenating bacteria, such as D. lykanthroporepellens, have shown great promise for clean-up of chlorinated solvent-contaminated soil and groundwater. Using qPCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequences for Dehalogenimonas strains have been found to be at concentrations as high as 106 copies/ml of groundwater contaminated with high concentrations of chlorinated solvents and comprise up to nearly 19% of the total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies. The characterization of D. lykanthroporepellens has aided in remediation plans through better understanding of the overall process of reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated compounds present in groundwater and the diversity of organisms involved. Due to its close relationship to Dehalococcoides spp., D. lykanthroporepellens was found to be amplified by primers that at one time were believed to be specific to targeting Dehalococcoides spp. Differentiation between the presence of Dehalococcoides spp. and D. lykanthroporepellens is important for remediation planning because D. lykanthroporepellens dehalogenates polychlorinated alkanes, but is unable to dehalogenate chlorinated ethenes like Dehalococcoides spp. Furthermore, D. lykanthroporepellens was the first pure culture isolated which could dehalogenate 1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP) under anaerobic conditions. D. lykanthroporepellens has also been shown to dehalogenate 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), 1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP), and 1,1,2-trichloroethane (1,1,2-TCA) present in mixtures and at concentrations as high as 8.7, 4.0, and 3.8 mM respectively. These findings are important because a large number of contaminated sites contain mixtures of various chlorinated solvents and/or high concentrations.

There are numerous notable television program creators; this article includes a list of many of them. Often, the creator is the writer of the pilot episode, or a director, or a producer. Sometimes it is a writer of the series bible, or writers' guidelines.donedealpro.com messageboard thread In the United States, a Writers Guild of America (WGA) screenwriting credit system governs credits. For example, the Writers Guild of America West provides specifications for creator credits that govern its members. The Producers Guild of America's corresponding code for producers defines \\"Executive Producer\\" and similar roles but not an explicit \\"Creator\\" role. Creator is a specific credit given explicitly in many shows. However, it has not always been a prominent, explicit credit. For example, Sydney Newman, the accepted creator of The Avengers (1961‚Äì69), was never given an explicit credit as creator; Newman never thought to ask for one.In Newman's memoir, The Avengers and Me, Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about his never receiving on-screen credit as creator of the series. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for The Avengers. Per: Patrick Macnee and Dave Rogers, The Avengers and Me (TV Books, 1998, ); republished in 2008 as The Avengers: The Inside Story (Titan Books, ) The creator of a television show may retain rights to participate in profits, often to be paid by the production company as a percentage of fees that it receives from networks and distributors. In 2014, for prime-time network TV shows, the WGA-required royalty to be paid to a writer with \\"created by\\" credit is approximately $1,000 per episode or higher. Who merits creator credit is sometimes a matter of contention. In a 2013 legal case, a director sued a former writing partner for co-creator credit.

Smith (August 13, 1883 - March 22, 1965) was an American violinist, composer, dance band leader and recording artist most popular in the second and third decades of the 20th century. Biography Joseph Cyrus Smith was born in Sag Harbor, New York in 1883. He was of Russian ancestry on his father's side, and Austrian on his mother's. He was a working musician by the time he was 16, and by 1903 was known for working in dance bands. In 1914 he landed the important post as resident dance band at New York's Plaza Hotel, where he stayed for nine years. He moved to Montreal and began a sequence of broadcasts on station CKAC. In the late 1920s he traveled widely as leader, including Canada, Europe, and both coasts of the United States. From the 1920s through the 1940s he worked as an arranger for the Robbins Music Corporation. He settled down in the New York City area in the 1930s, and retired in 1945, moving to Florida. He died of a myocardial infarction at a Miami Beach hospital on March 22, 1965. At the time of his death he was married to Margaret Lynch. Style Smith was instrumental in the transition from the heavy sound of military marching bands so popular before World War 1 to the lighter sounding dance music of the 1920s. Most of his recorded output are instrumentals, although Victor Records would sometimes assign an in-house vocalist to some sides. He was the first to record a Cole Porter song. Although not a jazz unit as thought of in the modern sense, Smith did often use jazz colorings in his arrangements. It was Smith's lack of use of instrumental soloists that led to his sound becoming outdated and the corresponding decline in his popularity as a recording artist. Recordings Smith was active as a recording artist from 1916 until 1925. He first recording session was for Victor, and his first recordings met with mediocre success, but in late 1917 several of his records became big sellers. Joel Whitburn estimates that 21 of his records were among the top-15 in popularity at some point. His recording of Smiles, featuring Harry Macdonough on vocals, is estimated to have been the #1 record for a week in August 1918. Many of his records featured medleys taken from current Broadway shows. By 1922 his records were not selling as well, and he made his last recordings for Victor in March of that year. He then recorded briefly for Brunswick Records in 1923. He last recorded in Montreal in 1925.

It is located in Portland, Oregon, featuring an AstroTurf field and a seating capacity of 3,500. It has hosted track and field events as well. The land that the stadium sits on was forested before it was built. In 1952, Graham Griswold donated US$25,000 and lumber towards the erection of a new football stadium, complete with grandstands. The first game that occurred at the stadium took place on October 10, 1953, with Lewis & Clark against the Linfield Wildcats football team. It was officially named \\"Griswold Stadium\\" in 1954 after the benefactor of the construction project. In 2003, lights were installed at Griswold Stadium allowing for night games. The AstroTurf (GameDay Grass 3D brand) playing surface was purchased for the field in 2010. The school dedicated the field to former player and coach Fred Wilson that year. Located in the stadium is the Eldon Fix Track which was last resurfaced in 1999. In 2012, the grandstands were rebuilt to allow for 3,000 general admission seats and 500 VIP seats.

The magazine is unique in that it attempts to have equally rural and urban readers, and to \\"appeal to the person who wants to romanticize farming and the person who is knee deep in turkey droppings\\", according to The New York Times. In 2014, the publication won the National Magazine Awards for the Magazine Section. Modern Farmer covers feature livestock and its articles include those like a series of interviews with agriculture ministers from around the globe. Its stories tend to take a \\"farm to table\\" perspective, comprehensively covering food and agriculture topics like Greek yogurt or feral pigs. In addition to the print magazine, it has a popular website; its \\"goatcam\\", a public web cam of goats, produced 60,000 pageviews alone. History Based in Hudson, New York, the magazine was backed financially by Fiore Capital and its founding CEO/editor-in-chief was Ann Marie Gardner; she was later replaced by Sarah Gray Miller. Gardner, a long-time magazine editor, came up with the idea for Modern Farmer when she tried developing a television show about a magazine editor covering a story about conflict between old and new farmers in Germantown, New York. After developing a set of stories for the fictional character, she decided to create a real magazine. In early 2015, the magazine's founder and much of its editorial staff departed the publication, with print publication suspended. The paper's owner said in a statement that it planned to return for a summer issue in 2015. Despite fiscal difficulties, the magazine did return in 2015, and as of February 2016, continues to publish, in part due to Frank Giustra's continued support for the project. In 2018, the magazine went online-only.

Tate, London Triptych‚ÄìAugust 1972 is an oil on canvas triptych by the British artist Francis Bacon (1909‚Äì1992). It was painted in memory of Bacon's lover George Dyer who committed suicide on 24 October 1971, the eve of the artist's retrospective at Paris's Grand Palais, then the highest honour Bacon had received. The work is the second of three \\"Black Triptychs\\" completed in the following years as a memorial to his lover. The dates of the last two triptychs are included in their titles, indicating that Bacon intended them as almost diary entries into a very bleak period in his life. As such the paintings are records of how Bacon was coping with the loss of Dyer at that particular time. They are haunted and permeated by the inevitable feelings of guilt experienced by anybody who has lost a close friend to suicide.Sylvester, 144 Context Dyer and Bacon in the mid 1960s. Photograph by John Deakin Bacon never really recovered from Dyer's suicide, and never again had such a close or long standing sexual partner. He said, \\"people say you forget about death, but you don't. After all, I've had a very unfortunate life, because all the people I've been really fond of have died. And you don't stop thinking about them; time doesn't heal.\\"Zweite, 168 He expanded further in the 1985 South Bank Show documentary he explained further, stating that \\"[people] are always trying to defeat death by leaving images, but it won't make any difference; we'll just be dead, though the image may live on\\".Bragg, Melvyn. \\"Francis Bacon\\". South Bank Show. BBC documentary film, aired 9 June 1985. The black triptychs are so named because of their bleak mood and due to the active role the black paint plays in each. In essence each is a memento mori, and they are part of a larger series of works painted in the aftermath, a succession of paintings that include smaller single heads of Dyer, and a number of Bacon's self-portraits that extend into the mid 80s, perhaps as far as his late masterpiece, Study for a Self- Portrait‚ÄîTriptych, 1985‚Äì86.Schmied,80 Of that work he said that people had died \\"around me like flies and I've had nobody else to paint but myself\\".Sylvester, 129 In this work Dyer is presented as a figure struggling in vain to survive; in the triptych of 1973 he is finally defeated, naked and vomiting into a toilet basin in one panel, in another wandering towards an open door to lay down and die. The panels in Triptych‚ÄìAugust 1972 document the final hours of Dyer's life, but in common with the other two works in the series, internally the sequencing of individual panels defy narrative interpretation; they cannot be read from left to right, and any depiction is as desperate as an other.Schmied, 83 Description The portraits on the wing panels are based on photographs of Dyer taken by John Deakin in mid 1960s. They are faithful to the photographs, except that the black background replaces the studio wall. They panels show Dyer in his underwear posing on a chair in the artist's studio. He is depicted as muscular and strong, but restless, ill at ease, and the two panels are filled with senses of movement and tension. Dyer is presented as literally a man falling apart. His body is mutilated; the black border dissolves into his body in both, leaving a void in place of large parts of his torso. In contrast he seems to be melting, leaving blobs of flesh on the ground beneath him.Zweite, 171 Bacon described this effect as portraying \\"the life flowing out of him\\". The center painting shows two men having sex; presumably Bacon is remembering his encounters with his lost lover. The depiction is based on Eadweard Muybridge's series of photographs of wrestlers ‚Äìa series he often referred to‚Äì but takes the idea much further, directly linking the act of love with acts of violence.Schmied, 82 Yet the panel is quite chaste; the upper man is without genitals. Art historian Denis Farr sees their embrace as without affection, and that they are more embraced in \\"mortal combat\\".Farr et all, 67 The outer wings are formed from a pair of long isosceles triangles, which contrast against the low isosceles triangle of the central image. In the outer wings, the back rectangles are flanked by inwards facing off white triangles. This compositional structure may have been influenced by Matisse's Bathers by a River, which also uses geometric forms to separate three figures and create wide bands. As in all of the Black Triptych's, doorways predominate, and form a menacing and foreboding presence, symbolic of death and the void the subject is about to pass through. As with the third triptych in the series, Triptych, May‚ÄìJune 1973, each panel shows a wall with a large open door behind Dyer. It is this doorway that emits the darkness, represented by black paint, that overwhelms and literally consumes the representations of Dyer, removing large parts of his flesh. In this work, Dyer in left wing has lost most of his torso, in the right wing the black removes an area of flesh reaching from his waist to his jaw. Both figures in the center panel have been eroded; and are reduced to little more than upper body and head; art critic Wieland Schmied that if the panel had been set a few moments later the black would have \\"swallowed [them] up entirely\\". Bacon first introduced this motif in his 1965 Crucifixion, however while that work was set in an open and public space, the figures in these panels are isolated and alone.Schmied, 81 NotesSources * Dawson, Barbara; Sylvester, David.

Inspiration Theroux wrote the novel whilst living in London. Although he is rumored to have based the main character Allie Fox on himself, he denied this in an interview for Atlantic Unbound, saying he based the character on a number of people, including Pap, Huck Finn's father.Atlantic Unbound  Interviews  2004.03.31 Plot outline The story is told from the viewpoint of fourteen-year-old Charlie Fox and centers around his father Allie, a brilliant inventor (\\"with nine patents, six pending\\") who becomes increasingly critical of consumerism in the United States, education and culture. Part One: Banana Boat Allie decides to move his family from Hatfield, Massachusetts to escape the influence of the United States and the world war he fears is imminent, to enjoy a simpler life in La Mosquitia on the eponymous Mosquito Coast of Honduras. They travel in their pick-up truck to Baltimore and after giving away their truck to a tramp they board a banana boat to La Ceiba. During a violent storm, Allie repairs a bilge pump and has several run-ins with Reverend Spellgood who is traveling with his family to his Mission in Honduras. His daughter Emily flirts with Charlie. Part Two: The Ice-House at Jeronimo At La Ceiba, Allie buys a tiny settlement called Jeronimo from a drunk German. They then travel up the coast via motor launch to Santa Rosa by which time Allie, through force of personality, has taken over the launch from its captain, Mr. Haddy and steers it up the Agu√°n River to Jeronimo. On arrival Allie inspires the local Creoles and Zambus and over the coming weeks they help him transform the overgrown settlement into a thriving community. He builds a huge ice-making machine called 'Fat Boy' powered by hydrogen and ammonia, and transports the ice it produces farther up the river to isolated tribesmen, only to find to his disgust that missionaries have already reached them and 'corrupted' them to the ways of the West. He then mounts another expedition to take ice overland into Olancho, but the ice melts on the journey. They arrive at a small settlement and meet a group of Indians and three 'skinny men' who they take to be slaves. On return to Jeronimo they find the settlement nearly deserted. A missionary, who earlier Allie had driven away, had returned and persuaded most of the Creoles to leave with him. Soon afterwards, the three 'slaves' from Olancho arrive with guns and threaten Allie's domain. He tricks them and locks them in 'Fat Boy' intending to freeze them to death, but their gunfire causes an explosion which kills the three gunmen, destroys Jeronimo and pollutes the river. Part Three: Brewer's Lagoon Escaping the explosion, Allie leads his family and Mr. Haddy through the jungle to Sico River, determined to move even further from civilization, and become less dependent on technology. They borrow a boat from a Miskito and float down to Brewers Lagoon where Mr. Haddy's mother lives in a nearby village. Mr. Haddy gave directions to the Laguna Miskita, 'it so small, when you gets there you ain't believe you there', which sounds ideal to Allie. On arrival they convert an abandoned dugout into a hut, beachcombing for materials (including an outboard motor which Allie repairs) and planting crops on the shore, total self-sufficiency. Then the rainy season starts, and a storm surge from a tropical cyclone washes away all their work. Mr. Haddy arrives under cover of night and gives Charlie a drum of gasoline and spark plugs, which he knows Allie would not accept; Charlie hides them on the shore. Allie finds them and determines to use the supplies to sail upstream, against the flow \\"that Mosquito Coast is a dead loss...there's death down there...Everything broken, rotten and dead is on that stream and being pulled down to the coast... I've been fighting the current all along\\". Charlie and Jerry want to return to the United States, but Allie tells them that it has been destroyed. Part Four: Up the Patuca The family heads up the Patuca River, passing several abandoned villages destroyed by the recent tropical storm. Allie bullies his family into agreeing to his plans to head farther away from civilization, and they hear about a village called Guampo far up the river. When they arrive, it's the Spellgoods' mission settlement complete with harbor, landing strip and church. That night, Charlie and his brother Jerry swim ashore and contact Emily. They arrange to borrow the Spellgoods' jeep and escape back to the coast after learning that the United States has not been destroyed. On returning to the boat they try to persuade their mother to drive them, only to find that their father has also gone ashore. Determined to save the locals from the influence of the Spellgoods, he blows up the airplane and the generator and returns to the boat, but is shot in the neck by Rev. Spellgood. The family manages to drag Allie to the jeep and make it to the coast, where Allie dies. Part Five: The Mosquito Coast Mr Haddy hears of Allie's death and takes the family back to La Ceiba, and they return to the United States. Reception Thomas R. Edwards in The New York Times praises the book, concluding \\"It is, characteristically, a fine entertainment, a gripping adventure story, a remarkable comic portrait of minds and cultures at cross-purposes...This excellent story, is an impressively serious act of imagination.\\"Paul Theroux's Yankee Crusoe New York Times, February 14, 1982 Kirkus Reviews criticized the novel's plausibility, pacing and thin characterizations, but goes on to say that \\"though the presentation of the serious ideas here is more noisy and colorful than thoughtful, the storytelling itself‚Äîfull of clever descriptive writing and inventive action‚Äîsustains the entertainment mightily\\"THE MOSQUITO COAST by Paul Theroux  Kirkus Retrieved 02 Feb 2014.

South African immigration to Argentina (also referred to as \\"Boer Colonization in Argentina\\") is the settlement of people from South Africa in Argentina, mainly by Afrikaners. This settlement began from 4 June 1902 onwards. Most of them ( including a handful of coloured servants) settled in Chubut Province, southern Argentina. The main cities where they settled are Comodoro Rivadavia, Manantiales Behr, Puerto Visser, Pampa Salamanca, Pampa del Castillo, Escalante, Ca√±ad√≥n Baumann, Pastos Blancos, R√≠o Chico, Sarmiento, Bah√≠a Bustamante, among others. Most Boers in Argentina were repatriated at the expense of the South African Government in the 1930s, but a remnant who loved the Argentine remained. South African settlers who arrived in Argentina, were entirely of Boer origin. Today the Afrikaans language remains, being the most widely spoken among some descendants that reach 300 people.Cr√≥nicas del Centenario, 1901 - 2001; Cr√≥nica, Comodoro Rivadavia This South American country was chosen by many South Africans to emigrate because of facilities to settle.  History  Between 1902 and 1907/08 about 600 to 650 Boer settlers came to Argentina. These Boers were descendants of Dutch and French settlers of South Africa (also called Afrikaners). They came mostly from the Transvaal Province and Orange Free State. Most left South Africa following the Second Anglo-Boer War as many had lost their farms in the war or regarded themselves as Bittereinders who felt they could not live under a British government. To migrate to the Argentine Patagonia region, the settlers sent two representatives to Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut Province, to manage the establishment of the new colony. They were greeted by Francisco Pietrobelli, with whom toured the region, and called for the government land. They came on British cargo ships with bullock carts and the national government provided them mules and tents. The distribution of land was authorized by then President Julio Argentino Roca and the Minister of Agriculture, Wenceslao Escalante, who was honoured with the name of the colony and, later, the department where it is located.

Family Anselm was the son of Peter II Adornes and Elizabeth Brader Ickx. His ancestors were from Genoa. In the second half of the 13th century the family moved to Flanders: Opicius Adornes moved in 1269 when Count Guy of Dampierre arrived. His son Oppicius II (the younger) settled around 1300 in Bruges. The Adornes family was closely involved in international trade and in the administration of the city of Bruges. In 1443 Anselm married Margriet van der Banck (1427-1480) of Bruges, and they had sixteen children: * Jan Adornes (1444-1511), canon of Aberdeen and Lille * Elisabeth Adornes (1445-1453) * Margriet Adornes (b. 1448), kartuizerin in Sint-Anna-to-Woestijne * Maarten Adornes II (1450-1507), prior of the Carthusian monastery Genadedal * Aernoud Adornes (1451-1517) married to Agnes of Nieuwenhove, as a widower, and became a priest resident in St. Anna-to-Woestijne * Jacob Adornes (b. 1453) * Anselm Adornes (b. 1454), member of the Order of St John * Catherine Adornes (b. 1456), Clarisse- Colettine in Ghent * Ludovica Adornes (b. 1457), nun augustines * Elisabeth Adornes (¬∞ 1459 of 1466) * Pieter Adornes IV (1460-1496), married to Catherine Uutenhove, lived in Ghent and was a widower brother-less observant * Anthony Adornes (1462-1492), canon of Aberdeen * Maria Adornes (b. 1463) married the Baenst Joos, parents of Joseph, Guido and Jan de Baenst * Gandulphus Adornes (b. 1465) * Elizabeth Adornes (b. 1466) married Wulfaert the Lichterveldestraat * Livina Adornes Around the same year of his marriage Adornes emerged in public life in Bruges.

Adornes' high status was demonstrated by the people who agreed to be the godparents of his children, among whom were: Louis de Gruuthuse, Tommaso Portinari, Abbot Jan Crabbe, Bailiff Jan de Baenst, Colard Dault and members of the Genoese families Doria and Spinola. City Council Anselm Adornes, succeeding his father and his uncle, joined the city council. Thus he was * Head of the Sint-Nicholas Estonians in 1447-48 and 1450‚Äì51 * Head of the Sint- Nicholas Estonians in 1456-57, 1458‚Äì59, 1460‚Äì61, 1462‚Äì63, 1473‚Äì74 * Councillor in 1444-45 and 1452‚Äì53 * Treasurer in 1459-1460 * Committed to urban finances of 1463 to 1468 * Mayor in 1475-76 He was also: * Orator of the Proosse (inherited function for the glory of the Deanery, like a ship) * Guardian of the Bruges leper colony Nadir The year 1477 marked a peak and a low point in his career. After the death of Charles the Bold there were riots in Bruges. Mary of Burgundy charged Louis of Gruuthuse and his son John together with Anselm Adornes and several other senior Bruges dignitaries to provide a peaceful solution. However, this did not prevent more riots occurring on 26 March. Anselm was arrested with fifteen other former city officials. It was suspected that they had used their positions for unlawful personal gain. However, these accusations came to nothing, and they were all released. On 18 May 1477 a notable number of people, including Adornes, were again arrested by an agitated crowd. Along with Jan de Baenst and Paul of Overtvelt he was interrogated and tortured. All three confessed to having stolen funds from the city treasury. They escaped death but the Baenst and Van Overtvelt saw all their goods confiscated and were forced to withdraw to life in a monastery. Adornes's punishment was milder, but he too was paraded in his underwear, barefooted and bareheaded, accompanied by the sheriff to ask forgiveness. He had to pay four times the amount he had confessed to stealing from the city treasury and was banned from public office. Trade Anselm followed in the footsteps of his grandfather Peter I Adornes by being active in international trade. He mediated primarily in transactions with Genoese merchants. Until his death he maintained commercial relations with Genoa and also Spain. His trade was mainly related to the importation of alum and cloth from Tournai and from England. He did not live in his house next to the Jerusalemkerk, but at the VerwersdijkThe Ververdijke site is now occupied by the College of Europe, whose renovation of the area in 2010-2013 restored several historic structures that were built long after Adornes' time (Dyers' Dyke, located between the Scots and the Scots Dyke Place) where he owned a large complex, with stacking spaces, and warehouses in the midst of the Scottish merchants. Relations with Scotland In 1467 the Scottish Parliament forbade trade with Flanders and the Scottish merchants had to leave Bruges. In the autumn of 1468, Anselm Adornes travelled to Scotland, at the head of a diplomatic mission to negotiate the return of the Scottish merchants to Bruges. He reached Scotland through England and obtained from Edward IV a safe conduct (10 October 1468) for a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The negotiations with James III of Scotland and the Scottish Parliament and were successful, and the merchants returned in the spring of 1470. The contacts he established with the Scottish Court meant a significant increase in his social status, not only in the county of Flanders, but also in Scotland. He was overwhelmed by favours from King James III. At the end of 1468, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Unicorn, and under a privy seal dated Edinburgh 15 January 1468/9 was named a royal councillor. Though not given a title at this time, Bruges documents on 3 June 1469 refer to him as Lord of Corthuy, a form of the Scottish Barony of Cortachy in Angus. From 1472 the title is also accorded to Adornes in official Scottish documents. On 19 February 1470, with negotiations for the return of the Scottish merchants close to concluding, Adornes left Bruges for his pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The journey was of interest not only to Edward IV but also James III, to whom the relation of his travels was later dedicated, and who, in a letter dated 10 June 1472 indicated he gave authority to Adorne to represent the Scottish Crown in Rome and among the Moslems of the East. On 11 February 1470 a Scottish embassy led by Sir Alexander Napier arrived in Bruges and in early April, an agreement was reached. Adornes eventually returned to Bruges on 18 April 1471. On 25 July 1471, Adornes was issued a 6-month safe conduct to convey Mary Stewart, Countess of Arran, sister of James III, to Scotland. She was returning from Denmark in an attempt to have her husband Thomas Boyd, 1st Earl of Arran cleared of all charges laid against him. The entourage embarked at Calais on 4 October 1471 and successfully returned to Scotland, where James immediately detained Mary in Dean Castle at Kilmarnock until her marriage was annulled in 1473. In return for Adornes' faithful service, James III, on 18 April 1472, granted to Anselm Adorne de Cortoquhy, King's Knight, lands formerly held by Lord Robert Boyd; and on 10 June 1472 the office of the privilege of the Scottish merchants at Bruges in the realm of the Duke of Burgundy (James III was a first cousin twice removed of Charles Duke of Burgundy, whose paternal aunt Mary was James's maternal great-grandmother). Adornes also received income from confiscated property in Forfar. In 1477, after the collapse of his fortunes in Bruges, Adornes returned to Scotland where he quickly re- established himself as one of James III's close companions and was appointed keeper of the king's palace at Linlithgow. He survived the rebellion against the king in 1482 but was murdered in the following year in circumstances which remain obscure.Fleming, Alexander & Mason, Roger (Eds.) (2019), Scotland and the Flemish People, John Donald, p.34 Jerusalemkerk Jeruzalemkerk, Bruges The Adornes family had a tradition of the veneration of the holy places of Jerusalem. In 1428, Pieter II Adornes and Jacob Adornes, grandsons of Opicius the younger and Margaret of Aartrijke, started building the remarkable Jerusalemkerk in Bruges. The Jerusalem Church was intended to be a copy of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Some sources state incorrectly that Anselm Adornes built the church. He was a child when it was consecrated in 1429. In 1470, Adornes undertook a pilgrimage on foot to Jerusalem, accompanied by his son Jan Adornes. Jan wrote a memoir of their experiences. He became a canon at St. Peter's collegiate church in Lille; a copy of the manuscript is preserved in their archives. After their return, Adornes enhanced the building. The tomb in the centre of the church is for himself and his wife Margriet. Today the church is known as the Jeruzalemkapel and is part of the Adornesdomein historic site in Bruges. Other Diplomatic Activities Anselm undertook other diplomatic missions in the service of the Duke of Burgundy in the 1460s and 1470s. The Duke had plans to undertake a crusade and as Adorne had visited Jerusalem, he could give him advice. Adorne also travelled to Poland, where he was received by King Casimir IV. In 1473 he negotiated on behalf of the city of Bruges for the cost of Tommaso Portinari's galley, the St. Matthew, which had been hijacked in the North Sea by Paul Beneke. Among other precious goods, the ship carried a large triptych by Hans Memling, the Last Judgment.Not to be confused with the ‚ÄúPortinari Altarpiece‚Äù painted by Hugo van der Goes, which is in Florence. The negotiations failed, and the painting is still in Gda≈Ñsk, in the National Museum. In 1477, 1479 and 1480, Anselm travelled to Scotland. After returning from this last trip his wife died. In 1482 he sailed back to Scotland. His contacts with King James III led him to command a military expedition in Linlithgow. When Anselm then undertook a pilgrimage, he stayed in a monastery in North Berwick, and was there on 23 January 1483 attacked by an armed gang who put him to death. He was interred in Linlithgow, but his heart was buried in the Jerusalemkerk later that year. Contribution to the Arts The artistic interest Anselm Adornes came in several ways: * Completion of the Jerusalemkerk. * He was an agent of Hugo van der Goes for the work known as the Trinity Altarpiece, containing panels with portraits of James III and his son, and of his wife Margaret of Denmark. The altarpiece is now on loan to the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh * He may have been the inspiration for a chapel based on the Holy Sepulchre, which was founded in Restalrig. * As part of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Dry Tree, Anselm was interested in polyphonic religious music and commissioned by King James III in 1472 he provided for the training of a lute player. * Adornes was in contact with the humanist Filippo Buonaccorsi * He had great interest in manuscripts and literary texts. He himself personally transcribed text of Cicero, his Somnium Scipionis Influence The family belonged to the patrician class in Bruges and held regular kinds of functions relating to city council and the Duke of Burgundy. Anselm himself had good relations with Flanders, Italy and Scotland, and he remained in close contact with the Scottish King James III, from whom he received lucrative contracts. Appearance in Literature The Anselm is one of the main figures in these historical novels: * The blue boat Lady of Hoet (Lannoo, 2002) *Onrustvlinder by Anna Coudenys (Manteau, 2008). * Adornes (as Anselm Adorne) figures prominently throughout the 8-book series known as The House of Niccol√≤ (1986-2000) by Dorothy Dunnett. The series embraces the years 1460-1483, beginning in Bruges, where Adorne becomes a mentor to the title character, and includes the pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The final novel encompasses Adorne's violent death.  References * J. Gailliard, Bruges et le Franc ou leur Judges and leur noblesse, Part 3, Bruges, 1857, p 103. * Ed.

Both the label and the belief that these people's symptoms are caused by this particular infection are generally rejected by medical professionals, and the promotion of chronic lyme disease is an example of health fraud. Chronic Lyme disease in this context should not be confused with genuine Lyme disease, a known medical disorder caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, or with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, a set of lingering symptoms which may persist after successful treatment of infection with Lyme bacteria. Despite numerous studies, there is no evidence that symptoms associated with CLD are caused by any persistent infection. The symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme are generic and non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain, and in many cases are likely due to fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. Fibromyalgia can be triggered by an infection, and antibiotics are not a safe or effective treatment for post-infectious fibromyalgia. A number of alternative health products are promoted for chronic Lyme disease, of which possibly the most controversial and harmful is long-term antibiotic therapy, particularly intravenous antibiotics. Recognised authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, even where some symptoms persist post-treatment. Following disciplinary proceedings by state medical licensing boards in the United States, a subculture of \\"Lyme literate\\" physicians has successfully lobbied for specific legal protections, exempting them from the standard of care and Infectious Diseases Society of America treatment guidelines. This political interference in medical care has been criticised as an example of \\"legislative alchemy\\", the process whereby pseudomedicine is legislated into practice.  Description and background  There are risks associated with long-term use of antibiotics, such as doxycycline, by people who believe they have chronic Lyme disease. Chronic Lyme disease is distinct from untreated late-stage Lyme disease, which can cause arthritis, peripheral neuropathy and/or encephalomyelitis. Chronic Lyme disease is also distinct from the post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), when symptoms linger after standard antibiotic treatments. PTLDS is estimated to occur in less than 5% of people who had Lyme disease and were treated. In contrast to these recognized medical conditions, the promotion of chronic lyme disease is a quintessential example of health fraud. In many cases there is no objective evidence that people who believe they have chronic Lyme have ever been infected with Lyme disease: standard diagnostic tests for infection are often negative. While it is undisputed that people can have severe symptoms of an illness, the cause and appropriate treatment promoted by \\"chronic Lyme\\" advocates are controversial. The symptoms are similar to those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. Fibromyalgia can be triggered by an infection, and then persist when the infection is completely removed from the body. A few doctors attribute these symptoms to persistent infection with Borrelia, or co-infections with other tick-borne pathogens, such as Ehrlichia and Babesia. Some conclude that the initial infection may cause an autoimmune reaction that continues to cause serious symptoms even after the bacteria have been eliminated by antibiotics. A review looked at several animal studies that found persistence of live but disabled spirochetes following treatment of B. burgdorferi infection with antibiotics. The authors noted that none of the lingering spirochetes were associated with inflamed tissues and criticized the studies for not having considered adequately the different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics used to treat the animals in the trials versus what would be expected to be used to treat humans. The authors concluded, \\"There is no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that such spirochetes, should they exist in humans, are the cause of post-Lyme disease syndrome.\\" Major US medical authorities, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Institutes of Health, have stated there is no convincing evidence that Borrelia is involved in the various symptoms classed as CLD, and particularly advise against long-term antibiotic treatment as it is ineffective and potentially harmful. Prolonged antibiotic therapy presents significant risks and can have dangerous, even deadly, side effects. Randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that antibiotics offer no sustained benefit in people with chronic Lyme, with evidence of both placebo effects and significant adverse effects from such treatment. Many people who believe that they have chronic Lyme have fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia can be difficult to treat, and antibiotics do not work at all for fibromyalgia. A pressure group called the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) says that the persistence of B. burgdorferi may be responsible for manifestations of chronic Lyme disease symptoms.  Identity  Chronic Lyme can generally be explained as a misdiagnosis of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. However, among people who self-identify as having chronic Lyme, the idea of chronic Lyme functions as a type of social identity. In this sense, the goal of the label is not to identify particular objective facts that differentiate one medical condition from another; instead, the main goal is to validate the real suffering experienced by people living with an invisible illness and to provide social support for them as they cope with it.  Political actions  While there is general agreement on the optimal treatment for Lyme disease, the existence of chronic Lyme is generally rejected because there is no evidence of its existence. Even among those who believe in it, there is no consensus over its prevalence, symptoms, diagnostic criteria, or treatment.Correspondence, \\"Reinfection versus Relapse in Lyme Disease\\", New England Journal of Medicine, March 14, 2013. (This exchange of three letters nicely illustrates the controversy and some of the issues at stake.) The evidence-based perspective is exemplified by a 2007 review in The New England Journal of Medicine, which noted the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease is used by a few physicians despite a lack of \\"reproducible or convincing scientific evidence\\", leading the authors to describe this diagnosis as \\"the latest in a series of syndromes that have been postulated in an attempt to attribute medically unexplained symptoms to particular infections.\\" Medical authorities agree with this viewpoint: the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Neurology, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for chronic Lyme disease, given the lack of supporting evidence and the potential for harmful side-effects,. including toxicities. A minority, primarily not medical practitioners, holds that chronic Lyme disease is responsible for a range of unexplained symptoms, sometimes in people without any evidence of past infection. This viewpoint is promoted by many who have been told they have the condition by people who lack experience in science or medicine. Groups, advocates, and the small number of physicians who support the concept of chronic Lyme disease have organized to lobby for recognition of this diagnosis, as well as to argue for insurance coverage of long-term antibiotic therapy, which most insurers deny, as it is at odds with the guidelines of major medical organizations. Paul G. Auwaerter, director of infectious disease at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, cited the political controversy and high emotions as contributing to a \\"poisonous atmosphere\\" around Lyme disease, which he believes has led to doctors trying to avoid having Lyme patients in their practices.  IDSA lawsuit  In 2006, Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General, opened an antitrust investigation against the IDSA, accusing the IDSA Lyme disease panel of undisclosed conflicts of interest and of unduly dismissing alternative therapies and chronic Lyme disease. The investigation was closed on May 1, 2008, without charges when the IDSA agreed to submit to a review of its guidelines by a panel of independent scientists and physicians which would occur on July 30, 2009, citing mounting legal costs and the difficulty of presenting scientific arguments in a legal setting. The medical validity of the IDSA guidelines was not challenged, and a journalist writing in Nature Medicine suggested some IDSA members may not have disclosed potential conflicts of interest, while a Forbes piece described Blumenthal's investigation as \\"intimidation\\" of scientists by an elected official with close ties to Lyme advocacy groups. The Journal of the American Medical Association described the decision as an example of the \\"politicization of health policy\\" that went against the weight of scientific evidence and may have a chilling effect on future decisions by medical associations. The expert panel's review was published in 2010, with the independent doctors and scientists in the panel unanimously endorsing the guidelines, stating \\"No changes or revisions to the 2006 Lyme guidelines are necessary at this time\\", and concluding long-term antibiotic treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous. The IDSA welcomed the final report, stating that \\"Our number one concern is the patients we treat, and we're glad patients and their physicians now have additional reassurance that the guidelines are medically sound.\\"Special Review Panel Unanimously Upholds Lyme Disease Treatment Guidelines: Short-term Antibiotics Proven to be Best Treatment for Patients Infectious Diseases Society of America. April 22, 2010.  Legal mandates to cover unproven treatments  The state of Connecticut, meanwhile, enacted a law on June 18, 2009, \\"to allow a licensed physician to prescribe, administer or dispense long-term antibiotics for a therapeutic purpose to a patient clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease.\\" The states of Rhode Island, California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Maine and Iowahttp://www.tamatoledonews.com/page/content.detail/id/603916/Cornfileds-- Common-Sense-and-Community.html?nav=5002 have similar laws. Massachusetts (2016) and Rhode Island (2003) have laws mandating insurance coverage for long-term antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease when deemed medically necessary by a physician. In 1999 Connecticut had passed a similar, though somewhat more restrictive law.  Harassment of researchers  In 2001, The New York Times Magazine reported that Allen Steere, chief of immunology and rheumatology at Tufts Medical Center and a co-discoverer and leading expert on Lyme disease, had been harassed, stalked, and threatened by patients and patient advocacy groups angry at his refusal to substantiate their diagnoses of \\"chronic\\" Lyme disease and endorse long-term antibiotic therapy. Because this intimidation included death threats, Steere was assigned security guards.  Media  A 2004 study in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal stated nine of nineteen Internet websites surveyed contained what were described as major inaccuracies. Websites described as providing inaccurate information included several with the word \\"lyme\\" in their domain name (e.g., lymenet.org), as well as the website of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society. A 2007 article in The New England Journal of Medicine argued media coverage of chronic Lyme disease ignored scientific evidence in favor of anecdotes and testimonials: The 2008 documentary film Under Our Skin: The Untold Story of Lyme Disease opened June 19, 2009, in New York City.\\"Film Focuses on Lyme Patients\\".

Originally laid out as the Romantic gardens of a country house, Aldershvile, the park still contains the ruins of the main building, which was destroyed in a fire in 1909.  History  Aldershvile painted by Heinrich Gustav Ferdinand Holm in c. 1850 Aldershvile was built by Johan Theodor Holmskjold, who was director-in-chief both of the Royal Danish Postal Services and the Royal Porcelain Factory. In 1782, one year after his ennoblement, he commissioned the architect J.B. Guione to build him a new and larger country house as a replacement for his old country hose, Sophienholm, which he found had become too small. The house was not completed until 1790. It was a white building with a hipped roof clad in blue-glazed tiles. It was surrounded by a 12-hectare English-style landscaped garden with a canal system. Johan Theodor Holmskjold died on 15 September 1793, not long after the completion of his new home. It turned out that he was heavily indebted and that he was guilty of embezzlement against both the Queen, the Postal Services and the Royal Porcelain Factory. The Aldershvile estate was subsequently sold to Adolph Ribbing, a Swedish count who had been exiled for his involvement in the murder of King Gustav III of Sweden. In 1901, Aldershvile was purchased by Angelica von Sponneck, who became colloquially known as the Countess of Bagsv√¶rd. She had been born in poverty, gave birth to the daughter of an Imperial Count at the age of 19, married another man and moved to South Africa, then divorced and married Adolf Goerz, the owner of a diamond mine, who died from tuberculosis in 1900. about 1804, Aldershvile was sold to Peter Nicolaj Arbo, a wealthy timber merchant and landowner, who died on the property in 1827. Back in Denmark, she bought Aldershvile and married the father of her child, Carl Sponneck but the marriage only lasted for two years. The house burned down in 1909 and was never rebuilt. She sold the site in 1911. Gladsaxe Municipality purchased the site in 1927.  Description  The ruin is used as a location in the 1952 film Det store l√∏b. The park consists of a mixture of lawns, meadows and forest areas. In popular culture Aldershvile Slotspavillon has been used as a location in the Television series Matador.

Context The shift from an industrial society, to information society and from information society to knowledge society brings profound changes in the way of looking at workforce and corporate culture in organizations. The blue collar concept prevailing in taylorism (scientific management) and the white collar concept of for information workers seemed to become increasingly obsolete according to many authors starting with William DemingMann, Nancy (1989).

Since the 1970s, Chris Argyris' contributions about organizational learningArgyris, C. 1999. On Organizational Learning, 2nd ed. Malden, Mass.: Blackwell Business. paved the way to new concepts in considering and managing human resources. More particularly, Argyris introduced the concept of \\"Double Loop Learning\\". He intended that not only workforce had to learn from the organization in order to perform properly their job, but the organization had to learn from the workforce, including in strategic issues.Argyris, C. 2000. Flawed Advice and the Management Trap: How Managers Can Know When They're Getting Good Advice and When They're Not. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press.

At the same time Edgar ScheinOrganizational Culture and Leadership (1985) stressed the importance of values, organizational culture and of leadership as key elements for success. In a latter publication, Schein seems to agree with Argyris in taking into serious consideration contributions bottom up.\\"Humble Inquiry: the gentle art of asking instead of telling\\" (2013) In the industries HP was an early mover. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard had an early and thorough understanding about the role organizations should play in society and about how to integrate in the most positive way the knowledge and the relational network of their workforce. ‚ÄúThe HP Way^ \\"The HP Way ‚Äì Hewlett-Packard Alumni\\". Hpalumni.org. October 19, 2000. Retrieved May 9, 2010.‚Äù was probably a concept which made the difference in setting up a very effective organization culture at HP. Teamwork was a key skill people who joined HP had to learn quickly. To do so, coaches and trainers took care of teams and of newly joined workforce. In this context was coined the term ‚ÄúTeam Based Organization‚Äù. Origin of the term In Europe, it was the newly created University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland which charged one of its professors to explore advanced management models in order to create a state of art master program compliant with European intellectual standards. As a result, the Master of Advanced Studies in Human Systems Engineering was launched in 2002 by Prof. Christa Muth and her team. She integrated the lessons learned in the three precedent decades by various authors with a thorough systems, life and human sciences approach in order to provide a robust framework independent from ‚Äúfashion in management‚Äù and from empiricism without theoretic background. Muth integrated in this master program an effective field approach she had tested in her extensive experience in consulting for organizations of all sizes and kinds. The intent was to get organizations prepared to manage complexity, change and innovation. Muth coined the term ‚ÄúTeam Based Learning Organization‚Äù as the auspicable direction organizations should chose if they have to tackle complexity and innovation. As during her academic career Muth was not a prolific writer, the concept was initially spread by her students and clients and found its own way to consultants who use it with their clients. Management principles In order to establish a TBLO, four management principles are essential:Dorier R, Muth C., Comment utiliser la complexit√© - Outils, attitudes et comp√©tences √† d√©velopper, jobindex media ag, 2010 1\\\\. Orientation on meaning and purpose: Managing by objectives limits people in their use of contextual intelligence; more, objectives tend to become quickly obsolete as realities change. Hence it is good to have people really on board as far as the ‚Äúwhy we do things and for whom‚Äù tends to become more important than ‚Äúwhat we should do‚Äù. When changes occur ‚Äì and this happens with an increasing rhythm ‚Äì people can react intelligently rather than in compliance with the target sheet of the MBO. Many other advantages result from being familiar and in line with meaning, as e.g. higher identification with the company, better retention scores etc. 2\\\\. Complementarity: Having people to perform not only in the area of their expertise but also in their work preference increases team performance. Sometimes it my request changes in work allocation or even in organization charts. Several methods are available to map work preferences (MBTI, Leonardo 3.4.5, Belbin, TMS, etc.). This allows a team to benefit from the necessary diversity of talents and intellectual resources. 3\\\\. Subsidiarity: Team members must feel collectively committed not only to the meaning and purpose of the organization, but also to the individual well being of each member as far as questions arising from the work situation are concerned, such as work overload, lack of information or skills, etc. Helping or being helped should be a very common way of sharing knowledge and responsibility. 4\\\\. Self- organization: When the three principles above are met, self-organization can take place. In this case teams can enter a ¬´ collective flow experience ¬ª characterised by a high level of work satisfaction, a strong bonding between team members and an exceptional level of independence and performance. Self- organization is the ¬´ black belt ¬ª of TBLO: it supposes an advanced understanding of management and the ability to let go as far as questions of power and prestige are concerned. The way towards self-organization usually takes organizations through a learning process which lasts usually 2 to 4 years. The conditions for success are ‚Ä¢ the determination of management to go all the way despite of inevitable difficulties and doubts, ‚Ä¢ sufficiently stable teams (good retention scores), ‚Ä¢ a skilled facilitation by a consultant who understands the concept to the full extent. Later close concepts In the wake of Human Systems Engineering close concepts were developed by other authors. ‚Ä¢ Emerging change was developed by Madeleine Laugeri on the basis of Eric Berne ‚Äôs theories (The Structures and Dynamics of Organizations and Groups).Emerging Change and Transactional Analysis - The Keys to Hierarchical Dialogue http://www.ltco.ch/en/content/downloads Laugeri was one of the professors in the Master Program Human Systems Engineering. ‚Ä¢ Fractal organization by Michel Henric-Coll FRACTALTEAMS¬Æ.

Shahid Alam Alam decided to become a physicist when his eighth grade science teacher at Saint Gregory High School in Dhaka, introduced him to atomic and nuclear physics. \\"I was hooked; I came home and told my father I know that I would become a physicist.\\" He was the first member of his family to come to the United States, and is one of the first Pakistanis to get a PhD in experimental particle physics. He is now a naturalized American citizen, and lives in the US. Alam is married and has two children. Academic history and positions Alam began his academic career at Dacca University, in what is now Bangladesh. There he earned a BSc in Physics and an MSc in Theoretical Nuclear Physics. He went on to earn a Phd in Experimental Particle Physics from Indiana University in 1975. Alam next spent a year at Vanderbilt University as a research associate before securing a position at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. In 1979, after four years at SLAC, he accepted a faculty position at Vanderbilt. Alam remained with Vanderbilt until 1984, at which time he joined the faculty of the University at Albany, SUNY. At Albany, he served as chair of the physics department (2003-2006) and director of the Albany High Energy Physics Lab. Still currently associated with Albany, since 2010 Alam has also held the chair professor of physics at the King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals. Research Alam's research has focused on experimental particle physics and computational physics. He was the principal investigator on several major experiments, including the ATLAS experiment at CERN, the BaBar experiment at SLAC, and the CLEO experiment. He has been author or co-author of over 1200 refereed papers, and counts 43 of these as his direct publications. The major experiments that Alam has directed or played a significant role in include: *(1972-1974) SLAC E-82 Searches for Exotic Associated with Mesons Using a Fast Forward Neutron Trigger with the 15\\" Rapid Cycling Bubble Chamber *(1974‚Äì75) SLAC E-103 Search for Exotic Mesons Using a Fast Forward Proton Trigger with the SLAC Streamer Chamber *(1976‚Äì79) MARK II at SPEAR studying collisions.

An earlier building, called the St Columba's Presbyterian Church Hall, was built on Venn Street in 1896. It was the first church building in Peppermint Grove and also acted as the only school in the neighbourhood until the construction of the Cottesloe State School. A few years later, land on the corner of Venn and Keane Streets was donated by Alexander Forrest (1849‚Äì1901) to build the current church building. It was designed by architect Louis Bowser Cumpston (1865-1931). Construction began on 20 November 1909, when the first stone was laid by F. A. Moseley. A foundation stone on the front wall of the church building reads, \\"This foundation stone of St Columba's church was laid by F.A. Moseley E.s.q.

They are independent and not-for-profit organisations that are run by a board and management team. To be a Learn Local provider, an organisation must be registered with the Adult, Community and Further Education (ACFE) Board. The ACFE Board is a statutory authority under the Education and Training Reform Act 2006. There are over 270 Learn Local providers across regional, rural and metropolitan Victoria, Australia. Every year, over 29,000 Victorians undertake government subsidised education and training programs through registered Learn Local providers. Learn Local providers are funded by the ACFE Board to deliver pre-accredited and other programs. Pre-accredited training builds skills for further study or to get a job.  History  Since 2011, Learn Local providers that are registered and funded by the ACFE Board to deliver pre-accredited training and other programs are known in Victoria as the Learn Local sector. Learn Local providers are part of the broader adult and community education (ACE) sector, which had its origins in the Mechanics Institutes established in the 1840s and the Centre for Adult Education, which was established in 1947. In the 1970s and 1980s, neighbourhood houses and learning centres began to offer learning programs for their communities. The majority originated out of the women‚Äôs movement and were staffed by and run for women. Many of these neighbourhood houses and community centres are now also Learn Local providers.

The Amarna Letters. EA 367, From the Pharaoh to a Vassal, p. 365. is a medium-small, square clay tablet Amarna letter to Endaruta of Achshaph, (Ak≈°apa of the letters), one of only about 10 letters of the el-Amarna corpus, that is from the Pharaoh of Egypt to his correspondent. (Two of the Pharaonic letters are lists, and not a 'letter' per se.) The letter is distinctive in that, 1- there are basically no spaces between the Akkadian language cuneiform signs, (lines 3, 4, 5 (end Para I scribe-line), and lines 6, 7, and 8), on the letter, and, 2- only a few segue-spaces (sections with no signs, except at the end of some text lines ‚Äì no segue spaces in the middle of the text, tablet obverse). And, some text extends to the right (the cuneiform starts at the left margin) into the right side of the clay tablet's pillow shaped thickness, and further into the reverse side, which would appear upside down in the text of the reverse. (See photo of Amarna letter EA 9, bottom right of reverse, (line 6 from obverse, upside-down).) EA 367 is about 3 in wide x 3.5 in tall, and is made of a dark clay. One trait of the letter is that the scribe uses some signs that have multiple alphabetic uses (um (cuneiform)-for umma (\\"message-thus\\"), also ·π≠up (=to 'um') of ·π≠up-pa for \\"tablet\\"), and g√°b, for the Akkadian language, \\"gabbu\\", allRainey, 1970.

History The initial goals of AutoMaidan included the resignation of the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, as well as Ukraine's alignment with international movements that respect freedom, human rights and campaign for peace. The movement consisted of drivers who were willing to risk and able to protect the protest and supply revolutionary camps, disobey the oppressive government, block streets and bring the Euromaidan to \\"the ruling elite's\\" doorsteps. The movement originated on 30 November 2013. In the early morning hours, after the dispersion of protesters on Independence Square in Kyiv, car owners started driving around the city with the specific purpose of signaling and displaying Ukrainian and European flags to agitate for massive protests against the oppressive-turned-violent government. Drivers brought hundreds of people to St. Michaels Square for free from across the city and suburbs. Automaidan organized numerous car processions to residencies of anti-Ukrainian officials including the one on December 29, 2013 to the president's residence in Mezhyhirya to voice their protests at his refusal to sign the Ukraine‚ÄìEuropean Union Association Agreement in December 2013. The motorcade was stopped a couple of hundred metres short of his residence. This resulted in AutoMaidan members being identified and becoming a major target of violent attacks by government forces, militia, and government sponsored titushkys. One of the organisers, Dmytro Bulatov, was kidnapped by unknown assailants on 22 January 2014 and reappeared on 30 January, having been tortured and visibly injured. On 6 February 2014, while undergoing treatment in Lithuania, he stated at a press conference in Vilnius that he was tortured to admit that his organization was funded and aided by Americans and the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine especially and that he was hired to organize the Automaidan and the riots against the (then) current government. During the press conference Bulatov repeatedly stressed that he believed he was abducted by the Russian special forces and that the leader of the Ukrainian Choice Viktor Medvedchuk might have been involved in his abduction.Bulatov says he was tortured to admit US involvement in riots in Ukraine, Interfax-Ukraine (6 February 2014) The kidnapping of Bulatov condemned by many, including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton. In an official statement released from her office on 31 January, she said \\"I am appalled by the obvious signs of prolonged torture and cruel treatment of Auto-Maidan organiser Dmytro Bulatov, who was found alive yesterday after having been missing for a week. [...] All such acts are unacceptable and must immediately be stopped. It is the authorities' responsibility to take all necessary measures to address the current atmosphere of intimidation and impunity which allows for such acts to take place. All unlawfully detained people have to be released and perpetrators brought to justice.\\" Two criminal cases involving Bulatov have been opened, one treats him as a victim of abduction, another as a suspect in criminal proceedings on mass riots.  Hrushevskoho Street riots  On 19 January 2014 at about 14:00 during viche (veche: public meeting), one of the members of Automaidan Sergey Coba, who demanded that the leaders of the three opposition parties represented in parliament choose one of them as the resistance leader, was widely supported by the gathered people. If his demand was not met within half an hour Mr. Coba promised that Automaidan would go to the parliament building and peacefully picket it until parliamentary deputies cancel the \\"dictatorship laws\\". The demand was not met and AutoMaidan, Self-defence and thousands of viche supporters went to the parliament building via Hrushevskoho Street.

They announced two reasons for that ‚Äì unwillingness to supply the personal data that AutoMaidan office body wanted and the appearance of people involved in financial frauds among self-proclaimed leaders of AutoMaidan.

They claim that most of what was done within those activities throughout the revolution was done mostly by the current activists of Autodozor while they were still activists of Automaidan.

The name refers to its principal decorations, five unusually large enamel plaques made using the senkschmelz technique, a form of cloisonn√© which looks forward to champlev√© enamel, with a recessed area in enamel surrounded by a plain gold background, and distinguishes it from three other crosses of the crux gemmata type at Essen. The cross is considered one of the masterpieces of Ottonian goldsmithing.  Description  The original part of the cross is 46 cm high and 33 cm wide, with a core made of oak excluding the later fitting at the base. It is a Latin cross with block-shaped ends. These appear similar to the cubic capitals which were popular in architecture around the year 1000.Beuckers, Farbiges Gold, p. 10. The front of the cross is covered with a highly decorated gold sheet, the back, with one of gilded copper, later in date, which is engraved and partly decorated in relief. The cross is a pure crux gemmata, in which the senkshmelz plaque at the centre shows the Crucifixion of Jesus. The Cross with large enamels is closely related to three other processional crosses in Essen, two of which, the Cross of Otto and Mathilde and the Cross of Mathilde were also donated by Abbess Mathilde. Just like the oldest of these, the Cross of Otto and Mathilde, it has an internal cross, surrounded by a border. While the border of the older cross is composed of gemstones each accompanied by two pearls, the border of the Cross with large enamels also included 24 small enamels (of which 21 still survive), which alternate with gemstones each accompanied by four pearls. The area of the Cross with large enamels inside the border is decorated with skilfully doubled filigree, gemstones, pearls arranged in the shape of crosses and an ancient cameo. On the cameo is a head of Medusa, technically referred to as a Gorgoneion. It is sardonyx and was made in the first half of the first century AD. The cameo is worked in three layers (grey-brown, white, and gold-brown) and has a maximum diameter of 2.7 cm. The cameo might be taken in reference to Psalm 91.13On a young lion and a cobra you will tread; you will trample the young lion and the serpent. as symbolic of evil's defeat by the saviour. The name of the cross derives from the five large pieces of senkschmelz enamel at the extremities of the members, and in the crossing. In the centre of the Cross there is a slightly oblong plaque with a depiction of the crucifixion: Christ is on the cross with his head inclined to the left and his eyes wide open. Mary and John (identified on the basis of his contemplative gesture) stand on either side. Above the horizontal arms of the Cross, personifications of the Sun and Moon watch the events. The enamel is surrounded by tiny pearls and due to its size it extends a little above and below the horizontal arm of the cross. At the ends of the members of the cross, inside a simplified border of gemstones, which matches the border of the cross' arms, four further large, irregularly shaped senkschmelz panels are found with the symbols of the Four Evangelists: at top the eagle of John, at bottom the winged man of Matthew, at right the winged bull of Luke and at left the winged lion of Mark. These large senkschmelz panels are unusually large for European work (as opposed to Byzantine) and of high technical and artistic quality, which is visible in the rich colours and fine delineation of the wings. The back plate of the Cross was replaced in the twelfth century and depicts the Tree of Life. In the expanded space at the ends of the cross there are four chased medallions depicting angels and in the centre there is a medallion depicting the Agnus Dei.  Creation and remodelling  The Cross is universally dated to around 1000 by scholars.Beuckers, Marsusschrein, p. 112 (with further references). This dating is based firstly on the motifs of the 21 small enamels of the border, which bear floral and carpet-like patterns, which arose around the turn of the millennium, and secondly on the framing of the stones and border enamels which seems to derive from the Cross of Otto and Mathilde (dated to around 982). The irregular form of the Evangelist plaques is conspicuous, as is the fact that the central plaque does not fit neatly to its position. These plaques were created around 1000. However, on the grounds of their similarly irregular shape, these plaques were probably created for another context and later incorporated into the Cross, which was considerably altered as a result. For this purpose, the plaques of the Evangelists, whose composition betrays Byzantine influence, were recut.Beuckers, Farbiges Gold, p. 8. Therefore, their irregular shape stressed the fact that they were spolia.Beuckers, Farbiges Gold, S. 11. In order to fit these plaques, the original border of the ends and centre of the Cross was simplified to the current form. Beuckers dated this remodelling to the time of Abbess Sophia.Beuckers, Marsusschrein, p. 112. In this remodelling, the collars of the ends of the cross became pointless and the goldsmith responsible for the remodelling concealed them with spiral-shaped filigree wire, known as ' (beehives). This ornamental motif came into vogue in the reign of Henry II (r. 1014‚Äì1024), along with another type of filigree decoration, the ' (corollae) which also appears on the ends of this cross (uniquely among the pieces in the Essen Cathedral Treasury). Sophia had been appointed Abbess of Essen by Henry II and was close to him, which might have given her the opportunity to employ one of his goldsmiths. Neither ' nor ' appear on the treasures which Sophia's successor Theophanu had made (presumably at another workshop), so Beuckers excludes her as the person responsible for the creation of the Cross with large enamels. It is not known why Sophia had a sacral object which had been created by her predecessor Mathilde remodelled and had another, apparently significant artwork of her own incorporated into it. If this dating is accepted, then the Cross with large enamels was created at the same time as the reliquary later known as the Marsus shrine. This artwork, considered the most significant treasure of the Abbey was a memorial donation of Emperor Otto III (r. 996‚Äì1002) for his father Otto II and was therefore very ornate. The shrine went missing in 1794 and no images of it are preserved. Beuckers assumes that the Cross and the Shrine, which was decorated with golden enamel plaques, were created in a workshop which was located in Essen.Beuckers, Marsusschrein, p. 117. Since the border enamels of the Cross incorporate motifs found in work attributed to the Trier workshop, and the Marsus Shrine was created after 997, Beuckers suggests that Abbess Mathilde moved the workshop established in Trier by Archbishop Egbert of Trier to Essen after Egbert's death in 993, following which there are no signs of continuing activity in Trier. The Trier workshop is the only firmly locatable Ottonian enamel workshop. If the cross was indeed produced by the same workshop, this allows conclusions to be drawn about the quality of the lost Marsus shrine.  History From its creation, the cross has been located in Essen, except for evacuations during wars and other crises. Because of the similarities with the two other crosses of the Cathedral Treasury, which show Mathilde and were also donations to Essen, it is assumed that it belonged to the Abbey continuously from its donation until the secularisation of Essen Abbey in 1802. However, the surviving records from the abbey, later cathedral, do not explicitly mention the cross. The Inventarium reliquiarum Essendiensium of 12 July 1627, the earliest inventory of the Abbey's treasury does not allow a certain identification, since it only recorded \\"Two crucifixes richly decorated with gemstones and gold, but gilded copper on the reverse.\\"The inventory is reproduced by Humann, Die Kunstwerke der M√ºnsterkirche zu Essen, pp. 34‚Äì35. This description applies to all four of the processional crosses in the Essen Cathedral Treasury. The Liber Ordinarius, which controlled the liturgical use of the Abbey's treasure, speaks of processional crosses only in general terms. During the Thirty Years War, the Abbess fled with the treasure to Cologne and in 1794, as the French advanced on Essen, the Abbey Treasury was taken to Steele (modern Essen-Steele), where it was kept in an orphanage donated by Abbess Francisca Christina of Sulzbach. At secularisation the Catholic Church of St John Baptist took over the Abbey as well as its property, as the parish church. It made the cross, along with the rest of the Cathedral treasury accessible to the public for the first time. During the Ruhr Uprising of 1920 the whole treasury was taken in great secrecy to Hildesheim, whence it was returned in 1925 in equally secretive circumstances.Lydia Konnegen, \\"Verborgene Sch√§tze. Der Essener M√ºnsterschatz in Zeiten des Ruhrkampfes.\\" in M√ºnster am Hellweg 58, 2005, pp. 67‚Äì81. In the Second World War the Cathedral Treasury was first taken to Warstein, then to Albrechtsburg in Meissen and thence to a bunker in Siegen. After the end of the war it was found there by American troops and the cross along with the rest of the treasury was taken to the State Museum in Marburg and later to a collection for displaced artworks in Schloss Dyck in Rheydt. From April to October 1949 the Essen Cathedral Treasury was displayed in Brussels and Amsterdam, before it was brought back to Essen. With the creation of the Diocese of Essen in 1958 and the elevation of Essen Minster to the status of Cathedral, the cross became property of the diocese.  Liturgical use  Details of the original liturgical use of the Cross are not known. When the sources, most importantly the Essen Liber Ordinarius of 1400, describe the use of processional crosses for processions, they speak generally and without distinguished individual crosses. Processional crosses were often used in pairs and on the basis of the creation of the Cross with large enamels under Abbess Mathilde it is assumed that the Cross with large enamels was made as a companion to the Cross of Otto and Mathilde. The two crosses were used together under Cardinal Hengsbach. The Cross with large enamels was last used in 1992 at the funeral of the second Bishop of Essen, Dr. Hubert Luthe. Today the Cross with large enamels, like the other three Ottonian processional crosses of the cathedral, is no longer in use for conservation reasons.

History On 3 July 1989, the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct (better known as the Fitzgerald Report) recommended the establishment of an Electoral and Administrative Review Commission. The Queensland Government acted on the recommendation by passing the Electoral and Administrative Review Act 1989 to establish the commission, whose purpose was to investigate and report on: * the Legislative Assembly electoral system * the operation of the Parliament * the public administration of the state * the local authority electoral system * local authority administration and to monitor the implementations of any reforms arising. The Commission was fully constituted on 21 March 1990 under the chairman, Tom Sherman. Tom Sherman resigned on 25 February 1992 and Prof Colin Hughes acted in the role of chairman, until David Solomon was formally appointed to the role on 15 June 1992. Having completed its role outlined in the Fitzgerald Report, the commission was wound up on 30 September 1993.

Not all of the EARC recommendations were acted upon by the Queensland Government and others were implemented differently. The local authorities recommended for amalgamation and the outcomes of the recommendations where: * City of Warwick, Shire of Glengallan, Shire of Rosenthal and Shire of Allora (not implemented as recommended, but all four were amalgamated into the new Shire of Warwick) * Shire of Clifton and Shire of Cambooya (not implemented) * City of Gympie and Shire of Widgee (amalgamated into the new Shire of Cooloola) * City of Maryborough and Shire of Woocoo (not implemented) * City of Bundaberg and Shire of Woongarra (not implemented, but instead Woongarra and Shire of Gooburrum were amalgamated into the new Shire of Burnett) * City of Townsville and City of Thuringowa(not implemented) * City of Gladstone and Shire of Calliope (not implemented) * City of Mackay and Shire of Pioneer (amalgamated into an enlarged City of Mackay) Although some of the recommendations were not implemented, many were implemented in subsequent reforms of local government boundaries.

Chemistry While the molecular weight of nicotinamide riboside is 255.25 g/mol, that of its chloride salt is 290.70 g/mol. As such, 100 mg of nicotinamide riboside chloride provides 88 mg of nicotinamide riboside. History Nicotinamide riboside (NR) was first described in 1944 as a growth factor, termed Factor V, for Haemophilus influenza, a bacterium that lives in and depends on blood. Factor V, purified from blood, was shown to exist in three forms: NAD+, NMN and NR. NR was the compound that led to the most rapid growth of this bacterium. H. influenza cannot grow on nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, tryptophan or aspartic acid, which were the previously known precursors of NAD+. In 2000, yeast Sir2 was shown to be an NAD+-dependent protein lysine deacetylase, which led several research groups to probe yeast NAD+ metabolism for genes and enzymes that might regulate lifespan. Synthesis Different biosynthetic pathways are responsible for converting the different B3 vitamins into NAD+. The enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the two- step pathway converting nicotinamide to NAD+. NR kinase enzymes can also function as a salvage pathway for NAD+, but this pathway is not essential. Supplementation Treatment of elderly (22-month old) mice with NR increased NAD+ thereby activating sirtuin 1 which reversed mitochondrial and muscular dysfunction. Increasing NAD+ with NR supplementation has been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity in mice. A small non-randomized clinical study administering 250-1000 mg/day of NR for 9 days showed a maximal two-fold increase in NAD+. NR kinase enzymes are essential for exogenous utilization of NR and NMN. Both NR and NMN are vulnerable to extracellular degradation by CD38 enzyme. Commercialization ChromaDex licensed patents in July 2012, and began to develop a process to bring NR to market. ChromaDex has been in a patent dispute with Elysium Health over the rights to nicotinamide riboside supplements.

Oil on canvas, 78 x 58 in. Destroyed. Portrait of George Dyer and Lucian Freud was a 1967 oil on canvas painting by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon, which he destroyed before it left his studio, though it was photographed and is highly regarded by art critics. Bacon was a ruthless self critic, and often abandoned paintings mid- work, or slashed finished canvases; something he often later regretted. The painting is the first to show his lover George Dyer clothed, wearing a jacket, shirt and tie. He is shown in a frenetic manner, full of life, confidence and panache, with his head turning from side to side as he addresses company. The portrait is one of the few to show Dyer as people other than Bacon might have seen him in his prime; charming, engaging and physically attractive. In contrast Lucian Freud is a ball of tension, his hands tightly gripped and placed on his leg. Both men are set in what appears to be a pub, and before heavy green curtains reminiscent of those in Bacon's studio.

With the acquisition of these materials Horace Ware began to build a cold blast iron furnace. The Shelby Iron Works Company started with meager beginnings by only producing 5 tons of cold blast iron a day because of its capacity. The lone furnace stack was built out of brick and stone and only stood 30 feet high. During the American Civil War, iron plating from the iron works was used on the CSS Tennessee, CSS Huntsville, and CSS Tuscaloosa, and in making cannons and shells manufactured by Churchill and Sons in Columbiana. The ironworks was connected to Columbiana by the Shelby Iron Company Railroad, which allowed the iron works to be connected to the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad.

It was released in November 1969 by Philips Records. The album was his first recording for a major label since 1965 when his first stint with Philips ended due to creative differences. Ben recorded the album alongside producer Manoel Barenbein, the vocal/percussion band Trio Mocot√≥, and an orchestral section arranged by Jos√© Briamonte and Rog√©rio Duprat. It was written by Ben during his previous few years performing independently and developing his unique samba-based style. He incorporated psychedelic and soul music for this lively recording, while his quirky lyrics dealt with everyday life, romances with women, Afro-Brazilian identity, and self-awareness. Guido Alberi's iconic cover for the album also drew on psychedelic influences in its pop-art illustration of Ben and symbols of contemporary Brazilian culture. Jorge Ben was a commercial comeback for Ben and featured several hit songs, including two of his most famous recordings \\"Que Pena\\" and \\"Pa√≠s Tropical\\". Critics have since associated the album with Brazil's samba rock and Tropic√°lia musical movements. In 2008, it was released for the first time in the United States by Dusty Groove America.  Background  Fellow Tropic√°lia musician Gilberto Gil (pictured in 1960) vouched for Ben to be re-signed by Philips Records. Jorge Ben began his professional recording career with Philips Records in 1963, when they released his debut album Samba Esquema Novo to immediate fan frenzy. In an effort to capitalize on the success, the label pressured Ben to hastily record follow-up albums of music in the same vein and cover songs as filler. The result was three albums within the span of 18 months and a strain on his relationship with Philips, which ended after the last of these albums (1965's Big Ben) was finished. For the next few years, Ben performed as an independent artist. His only album during this period, O Bid√∫: Sil√™ncio no Brooklin, was released in 1967 on the S√£o Paulo-based, small-market label Artistas Unidos and sold poorly. While continuing to refine his idiosyncratic samba-based style, he occasionally recorded singles for Artistas Unidos and wrote songs, some of which were recorded by mainstream acts such as Os Mutantes, Wilson Simonal, and Elis Regina. This caught the interest of Philips, which was under the new leadership of former Odeon Records executive Andr√© Midani. In early 1969, Midani re-signed Ben after musicians Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso promised to promote him whenever possible.  Recording and production  Jorge Ben was recorded at C.B.D. in Rio de Janeiro and Scatena in S√£o Paulo. For the album, Ben chose songs he had been working on since the previous year or two. In the studio, he was accompanied on several performances by Trio Mocot√≥, a vocal/percussion group he had met while touring S√£o Paulo's nightclub circuit in the late 1960s. Philips Records enlisted pianist Jos√© Briamonte to arrange an orchestral section for the majority of the songs, with the arrangements for only \\"Barbarella\\" and \\"Descobri que Eu Sou um Anjo\\" done by Rog√©rio Duprat. According to Verve Records, the album was produced with sound effects that were \\"state of the art\\" at the time.  Musical style  Ben (1972) plays hard-strummed guitar grooves on the album. The album's music is defined by what Brazilian music aficionado Greg Caz called a \\"patented hard-strummed 4/4 samba groove\\" that soon \\"inspired a whole underground movement known as samba- rock\\" and characterized Ben's recordings for the next decade. Music journalist Tom Hull identified the main elements of his lively samba-rock synthesis to be Trio Mocot√≥'s accompaniment and the string arrangements of Briamonte and Duprat, resulting in \\"the kind of tropical psychedelia\\" attempted by contemporaries Gil, Veloso, and Os Mutantes. Commenting on individual tracks, Hull compared \\"Descobri que Eu Sou um Anjo\\" to a \\"hard-rocking outtake\\" from the 1967 Love album Forever Changes and said \\"Take It Easy My Brother Charles\\" incorporates funk to the overall sound. According to AllMusic's Thom Jurek, Briamonte and Duprat's arrangements on the album are essential to Ben's fusion of American soul music with the samba and Brazilian folk song structures from his past work. The website's Alvaro Neder adds that this album and Ben's follow-up F√¥r√ßa Bruta (1970) represent his involvement in Brazil's Tropic√°lia cultural and musical movement.Kurek, Thom (n.d.). \\"Jorge Ben ‚Äì Biography & History\\". AllMusic. Retrieved 3 January 2019.  Lyrics and themes  Thematically, the album explores romances with women and everyday Brazilian life, including football fandom. In \\"Pa√≠s Tropical\\", he sings, \\"I live in a tropical country ... I'm Flamengo and I have a nega [black woman] named Tereza.\\" His lyrics are often characterized by zany reflections, repetition, and nonsense words. As Caz described, \\"for Jorge, it's not so much about the meaning of the words as it is about their sound. Instead of writing 20 lines, Jorge often preferred to write two that sound very cool and repeat them ten times.\\" Some songs reflect a burgeoning self-awareness in Ben's songwriting. According to Robert Leaver of Amoeba Music's international records department, the album \\"asserted Ben's identity with the confidence and exuberance of one who is comfortable in his own skin\\", particularly in its exploration of Afro- Brazilian perspectives. \\"Crioula\\" () portrays a black street-market worker who transcends her social status when she performs as a Carnival Queen during Brazilian Carnivals; she is described as \\"a child of African nobles / who by geographic mistake / was born in born in Brazil on carnival day.\\" Its final verse quotes text from the back cover of Gil's 1968 self-titled album praising black female beauty: \\"And as the poet Gil once said / black is the sum of all the colors / you black woman are colorful by nature.\\" Jorge Ben is strongly informed by African-American soul music's \\"ethos of racial pride, self- determination, and collective struggle\\", according to Brazilian culture scholar Christopher Dunn, who cited \\"Take It Easy My Brother Charles\\" as a prime example. Ben offers partly English-language words of caution to his \\"brother of color\\" in the song, which Caz said expresses a contemporary ethos in an unconventional manner. According to one translation of its Portuguese- language verse, Ben sings: Songs such as \\"Charles Anjo 45\\" explore everyday life in Brazil, including the favelas of Rio de Janeiro; a street in Rocinha photographed above The character of \\"Charles\\" is revisited on \\"Charles Anjo 45\\", one of several songs on the album that make allusions to the favelas of Brazil's poor non-white population. In the song, he is depicted as an underworld criminal figure from a Rio favela (\\"Robin Hood of the ghetto\\"). The narrative follows his melancholic departure for prison and his celebrated return to the neighborhood.  Packaging  The Flamengo logo affixed to Ben's guitar on the album cover The album cover was designed by Brazilian artist Guido Alberi. It is a cartoon illustration of Ben surrounded by a psychedelic collage of tropical plants, samba musicians, superhuman women, and the flag of Brazil. Ben is pictured with broken manacles around his wrists, a toucan resting on his bare shoulder, and an acoustic guitar in hand. The guitar is decorated with the logo of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, Ben's favorite football team. Caz has described Alberi's artwork as \\"an iconic psychedelic Tropicalia-style cover painting\\", while art designer Pablo Yglesias said it \\"remains the favorite cover\\" for many listeners of m√∫sica popular brasileira (MPB). According to Yglesias, either Ben or Alberi had drawn inspiration from Rio de Janeiro's Neorealist art scene (Neorealismo Carioca), which abandoned the high art values of modernism in favor of a focus on ordinary urban life and experimentation with popular, mass-produced mediums such as newspaper photography, graphic design, and comics. As a \\"magical realist portrait\\", the cover \\"mingles the important issues of the day, personal emblems, and symbols of his black Brazilian identity while employing decidedly uptempo pop illustration\\", he said. \\"Ben's 'colorless' features contrast remarkably with the day-glo rain-forest world surrounding him, reminding one of the arduous road to self-understanding and realiziation of racial equality.\\" The broken manacles also echo this theme for Yglesias, who said they represent the struggles faced by black people in Brazil and elsewhere in the world. For the back cover, liner notes expressing approval of Ben were written by Philips producer Armando Pittigliani. Pittigliani had signed and later dropped Ben during the singer's first stint with the label.  Release and reception  Jorge Ben was released on LP in November 1969 by Philips Records, and became Ben's commercial comeback. In the months leading up to the album's release, several of its songs had become hit songs for other recording artists, including Wilson Simonal (\\"Pa√≠s Tropical\\"), Os Originais Do Samba (\\"Cad√™ Tereza\\"), and, as a duo, Caetano Veloso and Gal Costa (\\"Que Pena\\"). These songs later became commercial successes for Ben when released as singles from this album. \\"Pa√≠s Tropical\\" and \\"Que Pena\\" in particular have remained among his most famous songs. According to Leaver, Jorge Ben became Ben's \\"most significant and commercially successful album to date\\". The album was released at the height of the controversial Tropic√°lia movement and sociopolitical turmoil in dictatorial Brazil, whose government was censoring and arresting the movement's more explicitly political artists. Veloso and Gil were jailed temporarily before going into exile in England, while Ben had some of his songs banned from radio play. At a music festival, Ben was heckled for his performance of \\"Charles Anjo 45\\", but the song entered the record charts and remained a staple of his repertoire. The album improved Ben's standing in Brazil's music community. As Jurek later wrote: Jorge Ben was not well received in Veja, however. Reviewing for Brazil's leading news magazine in December 1969, music journalist T√°rik de Souza argued that Ben had failed to project himself as a singer, composer, and guitarist. He largely faulted Philips for disregarding the rhythmic appeal of Ben's past success by hiring Br√≠amonte, whose excessive preoccupation with melody and harmony resulted in orchestrations that suffocate the songs, although Duprat's few arrangements were seen as \\"magnificent\\". The album was reissued on CD in Brazil during the 1990s, but eventually went out of print. In 2008, Dusty Groove America released a remastered CD in the United States. A vinyl edition was issued for the first time in the U.S. in 2018, when Verve and Universal Music Enterprises remastered the album in anticipation of its 50th anniversary.

Background Early in 1944, the United States military set their eyes on the Marshall Islands after landing on Kwajalein Atoll. To help with the attack, on February 17, 1944, they bombarded Truk, Caroline Islands, due to its proximity to the Marshall Islands. During this bombardment, the Japanese lost 300 aircraft and some 200,000 tons of merchant shipping. Defense of Marianas With the impending invasion of the Marianas Islands, Admiral Mineichi Koga, on March 8, sponsored Operation Z, as a defense against the American attack. This plan was approved by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, with a formal title of Combined Fleet Secret Operations Order No. 73. The operation called for the utilization of the remaining land-based aircraft numbering approximately 1055 in the Marianas, the Caroline Islands, and in western New Guinea. The plan's success also called on a naval force of around 9 aircraft carriers and their 450 or so aircraft assisting in the defense. The plan was intended to create the Kantai Kessen, one final battle that would devastate the American forces and force them to sue for peace. Cessation of operation Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome and Admiral Mineichi Koga, Chief-of- Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, respectively. Throughout the spring of 1944, the aircraft losses for the Japanese continued to mount which was severely endangering the success of the operation; however the death knell occurred on March 31, 1944, when Mineichi Koga and some of his staff were killed in two separate plane crashes, while the remainder were captured. Among those captured was Shigeru Fukudome, who was in the second plane (not Koga's). After extricating himself from the wreckage, he was able to locate land and began to swim ashore. During this portion of his ordeal, he kept the briefcase that contained the top secret documents concerning Operation Z. After spending hours in the ocean, all the while approaching the coastline, he was spotted by some Filipino fishermen. Not sure if they were friendly or rebels, Fukudome released the briefcase with the intention of allowing it to sink; however, as he was picked up, the local fishermen noticed the slowly sinking briefcase and brought it aboard. Upon reaching land, the documents were sent to the American forces for analysis. A clandestine high-priority submarine pickup was arranged, with a cover story of evacuating American refugees. The submarine picked up the documents, along with 40 American men, women and children. Traveling mostly on the surface for speed, and diving only when needed, the submarine survived depth charging twice, arriving near the American naval base in Darwin, Australia on May 19. From there, the documents were flown to Brisbane. The Z Plan documents were in plain text, rather than code, and were translated on an urgent basis by the top five translators at the Military Intelligence Service attached to the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, it was first translated by Yoshikazu Yamada and George \\"Sankey\\" Yamashiro, two nisei translators. Copies of the translation were rushed to General Douglas MacArthur, who quickly forwarded them to Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet (and Admiral Koga's counterpart). Among other things, planned Japanese diversionary tactics were now anticipated by the Americans, leading to the lopsided American victory in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the largest aircraft carrier battle in history, and one of the decisive battles of the Pacific war. After the loss of the plans, Admiral Toyoda Soemu rewrote the plans in a more aggressive manner and named it Operation A-Go.

Such division is an element of traditional grammar. Types of clauses In standard English, sentences are composed of five clause patterns: # Subject + Verb (intransitive) Example: She runs to the meeting. # Subject + Verb (transitive) + Object Example: She runs the meeting. # Subject + Verb (linking) + Subject Complement (adjective, noun, pronoun) Example: Abdul is happy. Jeanne is a person. I am her. # Subject + Verb (transitive) + Indirect Object + Direct Object Example: She made me a pie. This clause pattern is a derivative of S+V+O, transforming the object of a preposition into an indirect object of the verb, as the example sentence in transformational grammar is actually \\"She made a pie for me\\". # Subject + Verb (transitive) + Object + Object Complement Example: They made him happy. They did not make \\"him\\", and they did not make \\"happy\\"; they made \\"him happy\\"‚Äîthe object and its complement form a syntactical unit. Sentences ‚Äì which are composed of these clauses, in either \\"dependent\\" or \\"independent\\" form ‚Äì also have patterns, as explained below. Kinds of sentences  A simple sentence consists of only one clause. A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses. A complex sentence has at least one independent clause plus at least one dependent clause. A set of words with no independent clause may be an incomplete sentence, also called a sentence fragment. A sentence consisting of at least one dependent clause and at least two independent clauses may be called a complex-compound sentence or compound- complex sentence. Sentence 1 is an example of a simple sentence. Sentence 2 is compound because \\"so\\" is considered a coordinating conjunction in English, and sentence 3 is complex. Sentence 4 is compound-complex (also known as complex- compound). Example 5 is a sentence fragment. #I like trains. #I don't know how to bake, so I buy my bread already made. #I enjoyed the apple pie that you bought for me. #The dog lived in the garden, but the cat, who was smarter, lived inside the house. #What an idiot. The simple sentence in example 1 contains one clause. Example 2 has two clauses (I don't know how to bake and I buy my bread already made), combined into a single sentence with the coordinating conjunction so. In example 3, I enjoyed the apple pie is an independent clause, and that you bought for me is a dependent clause; the sentence is thus complex. In sentence 4, The dog lived in the garden and the cat lived inside the house are both independent clauses; who was smarter is a dependent clause. Example 5 features a noun phrase but no verb. It is not a grammatically complete clause. Simple sentences A simple sentence structure contains one independent clause and no dependent clauses. *I run. This simple sentence has one independent clause which contains one subject, I, and one verb, run. *The girl ran into her bedroom. This simple sentence has one independent clause which contains one subject, girl, and one predicate, ran into her bedroom. The predicate is a verb phrase that consists of more than one word. *In the backyard, the dog barked and howled at the cat. This simple sentence has one independent clause which contains one subject, dog, and one predicate, barked and howled at the cat. This predicate has two verbs, known as a compound predicate: barked and howled. This compound verb should not be confused with a compound sentence. In the backyard and at the cat are prepositional phrases. Compound sentences In English language, a compound sentence is composed of at least two independent clauses. It does not require a dependent clause. The clauses are joined by a coordinating conjunction (with or without a comma), a semicolon that functions as a conjunction, a colon instead of a semicolon between two sentences when the second sentence explains or illustrates the first sentence and no coordinating conjunction is being used to connect the sentences, or a conjunctive adverb preceded by a semicolon. A conjunction can be used to make a compound sentence. Conjunctions are words such as for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. Examples: * I started on time, but I arrived late. * I will accept your offer or decline it; these are the two options. * The law was passed: from April 1, all cars would have to be tested. * The war was lost; consequently, the whole country was occupied. The use of a comma to separate two independent clauses without the addition of an appropriate conjunction is called a comma splice and is generally considered an error (when used in the English language). Example: * The sun was shining, everyone appeared happy. If a sentence contains homogenous members referring to another common member of the sentence, the sentence may be considered either simple or compound. If the homogenous members are removed, then the sentence is called contracted. In some languages, like Russian, a comma is not always required in a sentence with homogenous members. * Alex likes to fish, and he is going fishing on Friday ‚Äì Alex likes to fish, and is going fishing on Friday. * –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å –ª—é–±–∏—Ç –ª–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å —Ä—ã–±—É, –∏ –æ–Ω –ø–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ —Ä—ã–±–∞–ª–∫—É –≤ –ø—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—É ‚Äì –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å –ª—é–±–∏—Ç –ª–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å —Ä—ã–±—É –∏ –ø–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ —Ä—ã–±–∞–ª–∫—É –≤ –ø—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—É. (Russian) Complex and compound-complex sentences A complex sentence has one or more dependent clauses (also called subordinate clauses). Since a dependent clause cannot stand on its own as a sentence, complex sentences must also have at least one independent clause. In short, a sentence with one or more dependent clauses and at least one independent clause is a complex sentence. A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus one or more dependent clauses is called compound-complex or complex-compound. In addition to a subject and a verb, dependent clauses contain a subordinating conjunction or similar word. There are a large number of subordinating conjunctions in English. Some of these give the clause an adverbial function, specifying time, place, or manner. Such clauses are called adverbial clauses. *When I stepped out into the bright sunlight, from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind. (S. E. Hinton, The Outsiders) This complex sentence contains an adverbial clause, When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house. The adverbial clause describes when and where the action of the main clause, I had only two things on my mind, took place. A relative clause is a dependent clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase in the independent clause. In other words, the relative clause functions similar to an adjective. *Let him who has been deceived complain. (Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote) *You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. (J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) In the first example, the restrictive relative clause who has been deceived specifies or defines the meaning of him in the independent clause, Let him complain. In the second example, the non-restrictive relative clause who have never known your family describes you in the independent clause, You see them standing around you. A noun clause is a dependent clause that functions like a noun. A noun clause may function as the subject of a clause, or as a predicate nominative or an object. *What she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst. (Stieg Larsson, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) In this sentence the independent clause contains two noun clauses. The noun clause What she had realized serves as the subject of the verb was, and that love was that moment serves as complement. The sentence also contains a relative clause, when your heart was about to burst. Incomplete sentences An incomplete sentence or sentence fragment, is a set of words which does not form a complete sentence, either because it does not express a complete thought or because it lacks some grammatical element, such as a subject or a verb. A dependent clause without an independent clause is one example of an incomplete sentence. Some prescriptive grammarse.g. H. W. Fowler in Modern English Usage on BUT, p. 60 in the first edition. consider sentences starting with a conjunction such as but or and to be incomplete sentences, but this style prescription has \\"no historical or grammatical foundation\\". Computer grammar checkers often highlight incomplete sentences. If the context is clear from the rest of the paragraph, however, an incomplete sentence may be permissible. Run-on sentences A run-on sentence consists of two or more independent clauses (i.e., clauses that have not been made dependent through the use of a relative pronoun or a subordinating conjunction) that are joined without appropriate punctuation: the clauses \\"run on\\"‚Äîinto confusion rather than clarity, like intersecting streets without signs for Yield or Stop. The independent clauses can be \\"fused\\", as in \\"It is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark\\", in which case the two independent clauses might be separated (between \\"five\\" and \\"we\\") with a period [...five. We...], a comma and conjunction (...five, and we...), or a semicolon (...five; we...). The independent clauses can be joined inadequately with only a comma (the comma splice). James Joyce's novel Ulysses employs stream of consciousness, which takes literary license by intentionally breaking this grammatical rule by use of long, punctuation-free, run-on sentences, particularly in the final chapter \\"Penelope\\". In general, run-on sentences occur when two or more independent clauses are joined without using a coordinating conjunction (i.e. for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or correct punctuation (i.e. semicolon, dash, or period). A run-on sentence can be as short as four words - for instance, I drive she walks, or even I drive, she walks, \\\\- because in these short cases there are two subjects paired with two intransitive verbs. An imperative sentence like \\"Run walk\\" can be a run-on even if it only has two words. While some sources view comma splices as a form of run-on sentences, others limit the term to independent clauses that are joined without punctuation. Per The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, the term \\"run-on sentence\\" is also used for \\"a very long sentence, especially one lacking order or coherence\\".The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language See also *Comma splice  References External links  Category:Syntactic entities Category:Sentences by type Category:Punctuation Category:English grammar ","title":"Sentence clause structure"},{"id":"41823738","text":"The 1942 WANFL season was the 58th season of the Western Australian National Football League. Whilst the previous two seasons had been increasingly affected by the drift of players to the services, the 1941/1942 off-season saw the Imperial Japanese Navy and air force move into the north of Western Australia, bombing many northwestern settlements. Consequently, virtually all senior WANFL players had been enlisted to war work or the military.‚ÄòLeague Football Suspended‚Äô; The Daily News, 26 February 1942, p. 6 By the new year the WANFL was aware that normal senior league football would be impossible, and the league decided after debate late in February to conduct a competition for those too young for military service, with players required to be under the age of eighteen on 1 October 1942. Teams were largely drawn from the Young Sports‚Äô Temperance League, which had fifty-three clubs in 1941.‚ÄòFootball: War- Time Competitions ‚Äì The Under-Age Groups‚Äô; The West Australian, 26 February 1942, p. 2 Associated with the under-age competition was the temporary abolition of district football with the expectation that when peace returned players would return to the club for which they would ordinarily be zoned.

When the season was planned, it was proposed to exclude Perth and Swan Districts, who had been the bottom two clubs in 1941 and lacked adequate junior players. Perth eventually fought for inclusion, resulting in a seven-team competition with a bye until the clubs had played each other twice, after which it was announced the bottom team would drop out and, as in the WAFL between 1911 and 1913 and the 1943 VFL season, a bye-less draw was made for the last five rounds. Perth were the team to drop out, after winning two early matches, whilst 1941 premiers West Perth proved the strongest team all through the season and possessed not only the premiership but also the Sandover Medallist (a future Swan Districts player), the leading goalkicker and a future postwar star in Fred Buttsworth. A notable tragedy occurred in August when high-flying key forward John Hetherington of Subiaco, whose superb marking won rave reviews and gave him fifty-four goals in twelve matches, was struck down by polio and became a paraplegic despite the problem being initially seen as back trouble.Spillman, Ken; Diehards: The Story of the Subiaco Football Club 1896‚Äì1945; pp. 167-168.

It was created by Lee David Zlotoff and funded by the American Broadcasting Corporation, Walt Disney and Rai uno radiotelevisione, with Lockheed acting as technical advisors. The film features a fictional small \\"all-American\\" Pacific Northwest logging and mining town called Plymouth that is destroyed by a Love Canal- style ecological disaster, in this case in the form of a severe radiation leak from a nearby factory. The corporation responsible, UNIDAC, compensates the surviving townsfolk for the loss of their homes, possessions, and accustomed lifestyle by establishing a Moon colony on the site of a previously struggling mining project. UNIDAC offers to pay each member of the town to emigrate and start their lives over in the new outer space colony named after their former town. The film then focuses on their new lives as they adjust to space hazards such as radiation from solar storms, extravehicular excursions in airless environs, and medical crises in the lunar gravity. The film starred Dale Midkiff, Cindy Pickett, Richard Hamilton and Jerry Hardin. The film was first broadcast on Sunday, May 26, 1991. At the time it was considered to be one of the most expensive such movies ever made. The movie's soundtrack was scored by Brad Fiedel. Elements of the film's set and prop design would show up in a number of later TV and film productions.

Originally formed during the prewar buildup of the Red Army, the 140th might be regarded as the unluckiest division in the Army, as it, uniquely, had to be completely, or almost completely, re-formed three times between 1941 and 1943, being destroyed in the Uman pocket during Operation Barbarossa, the Vyasma pocket during Operation Typhoon, and on the Caucasian steppes in the face of the German summer offensive of 1942. In spite of this, the fourth formation of the 140th went on to have a very distinguished record in combat, a testament to the resiliency of the Red Army in World War II.  1st Formation  The division was first organized on August 16, 1939, at Uman in the Ukrainian (later: Kiev Special) Military District. Col. Luka Gerasimovich Basanets was appointed to command the division on the same day, and he would lead it through its entire 1st formation. On June 22, 1941, it was still in that District, and had the following order of battle: * 445th Rifle Regiment * 637th Rifle Regiment * 798th Rifle Regiment * 309th Light Artillery Regiment * 371st Howitzer Regiment * 181st Reconnaissance BattalionCharles S.

By late July it was in 49th Rifle Corps in that same army, near MonastyryshcheDavid Stahel, Kiev 1941, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2012, pp. 82-83 but was later relocated to Southern Front.

Its order of battle was as follows: * 37th Militia Regiment * 38th Militia Regiment * 39th Militia Regiment * Artillery Battalion (76mm) * Artillery Battalion (45mm) * Sapper, Reconnaissance and Signal Companies By July 6 the division had 11,000 personnel assigned, including 1,000 members of the Communist Party and 700 Komsomols. Three days later the division had 13,000 personnel, but some were reassigned to other militia divisions to complete their establishments, so when the division left Moscow on July 15 it had 8,010 in the ranks, but little or no heavy equipment, motorized transport, or radios.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades, 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XI, Nafziger, 1996, p. 117 The division was assigned to 32nd Army at Mozhaisk by July 19 and remained in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in that Army until it was re-designated on September 26 as the new 140th Rifle DivisionDunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 74 with: * 1305th Rifle Regiment ‚Äì from 37th Militia Regiment * 1307th Rifle Regiment ‚Äì from 38th Militia Regiment * 1309th Rifle Regiment ‚Äì from 39th Militia Regiment * 977th Artillery Regiment ‚Äì from Militia Artillery Battalion (76mm guns) On the same day Col.

In late May the 140th was transferred to the 24th Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and sent south. 24th Army arrived in Southern Front just at the opening of the German summer offensive, Operation Blue, in June. In early July the division was transferred to the reserves of 9th Army.

The division was passed to Red Army control as the 140th in February, 1943. At that time it had 8,685 officers and men assigned, 69 percent of whom were under 30 years of age, quite a youthful cadre for a late-war division. They were also noted as being 50 percent Russian nationality, 15 percent Ukrainian, and the remaining 35 percent mixed non- Slavic.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 592 Officially these men were drawn from internal troops and border guards of the NKVD. As the Siberian Military District had no external borders, it's likely that some were taken from guards of the GULAG and other sources that were off-limits to the Red Army.Sharp; \\"Red Swarm\\"; p. 54 On March 19, General Yenshin handed the command over to Col. Zinovii Samoilovich Shekhtman, who would, in turn, hand command to Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Yakovlevich Kiselyov on May 11. As with the other NKVD divisions, the 140th was assigned to the 70th Army in the Central Front.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p. 258 During the Battle of Kursk the 70th Army fought on the left flank of the 2nd Tank Army and played a role in stopping the German 9th Army that was trying to break through to Kursk from the north.Robin Cross, The Battle of Kursk, Penguin Books, London, 1993, p. 166 On July 7, the third day of the battle, elements of the division were holding the village of Samodurovka. From there they were conducting long-range anti-tank fire against the flank of a battlegroup from 2nd Panzer Division advancing on the key objective of Olkhovatka. The battlegroup commander, Col. Arnold Burmeister, diverted some of his armor, including Tigers, towards this threat, and drove the Soviet forces from the village, destroying a supporting company of T-34s in the process. Lacking infantry, Burmeister chose to leave Samodurovka vacant, and it was reoccupied by Soviet troops overnight. The next day, the fresh 4th Panzer Division was committed, retaking Samodurovka before beginning to advance on Teploye, which was held in strength by the 140th, backed by the 3rd Anti-Tank Brigade and the 79th Tank Brigade from the 19th Tank Corps. One battalion of the division was overrun and the German forces occupied part of the town before running into a \\"wall of fire\\" from dug-in tanks and anti-tank guns. The stand of the 140th at Teploye, along with that of the 307th Rifle Division at Ponyri, proved to be the high-water marks of 9th Army's advance.Robert Forczyk, Tank Warfare on the Eastern Front 1943-1945, Pen & Sword Books Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2016, pp. 113-16 During the subsequent Red Army counteroffensive, the 70th Army took part in Operation Kutuzov and attacked Trosna to the south of the town of Kromy. On August 5, its units reached the region southwest of Kromy, and on the 17th they reached the German \\"Hagen\\" defense line near Domakha.  Advance  Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Yakovlevich Kiselyov, Hero of the Soviet Union Later that month the division was moved to the 19th Rifle Corps of the 65th Army, and participated in the advance towards the Dnepr River over the following weeks. On September 16 it assisted in liberating the town of Novgorod-Severski and was given the name of that town as its divisional honorific: This was in addition to the title Siberian, which it had carried since its fourth formation. Battles for Belarus By October 1, 19th Corps had reached the Sozh River, on the right flank of 65th Army south of the Iput River, and one division of the Corps, the 354th, had already taken a small bridgehead over the Sozh. Lt. Gen. Pavel Batov, commander of 65th Army, planned an advance from this bridgehead by 19th Corps in the direction of Gomel, once it was reinforced by the 140th and the 37th Guards Rifle Divisions. The attack by the three divisions began on October 1, fanning out to capture the villages of Noyve and Starye Diatlovichi from the German 6th Infantry Division. By late on the next day the bridgehead had been expanded to a depth of 4 km in heavy fighting, but Batov's commitment of 19th Corps' final division, the 162nd, was not sufficient to counter the reserves brought in by German 2nd Army, and the advance stalled before the key town of Zherebnaia, guarding the southwestern approach to Gomel. This ended the first attempt on that city.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 97-99, 101 From October 27 to November 9, Belorussian (the renamed Central) Front carried out a major regrouping as 65th Army was redeployed southwards to a large bridgehead over the Sozh south of the junction of the Dnepr and the Sozh at Loev. When the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive began on November 10, 19th Corps was in the center of its Army, with the 140th in second echelon. The Corps' mission was to penetrate the enemy defenses between Gancharov Podel and Budishche 5 km deep, allowing the Army's mobile groups to exploit a breakthrough. Within three days the attacking Soviet forces had torn a 15 km wide and 8 ‚Äì 12 km deep gap in the German defenses. 19th and 27th Rifle Corps created the penetration that allowed 1st Guards Tank and 7th Guards Cavalry Corps to break into the enemy rear. By November 15, all German communications between Kalinkovichi and Rechitsa were cut, rendering their positions in the latter city untenable. After briefly contesting the western outskirts of Rechitsa, 19th Corps was ordered to bypass and continue marching north towards Parichi, some 80 km on. Early on November 20 the 37th Guards, flanked by the 140th and 162nd, reached the Berezina River near Gorval, and the guardsmen took a small bridgehead on the east bank; on the same day Rechitsa fell to units of 48th Army.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 178-82, 186 The 65th Army continued its advance on November 22, while fresh attacks by other elements of Belorussian Front turned the German position at Gomel into a \\"great, sagging, tactically useless bulge\\", and Hitler finally authorized its evacuation on the 24th. In this same period the 140th was transferred to 18th Rifle Corps, still in 65th Army. Batov's intention now was to advance westward towards Kalinkovichi, but the arrival of 5th Panzer Division stabilized the German front, and the offensive was halted within days.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 190-91, 197-98 By the end of the month the 140th was depleted to the point that it went into Belorussian Front reserves for rebuilding.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 305 Battles for Ukraine and Czechoslovakia The STAVKA sent orders to General Rokossovsky on December 9 to transfer six rifle divisions, including the 140th, to 1st Ukrainian Front.Glantz, Belorussia, p. 243 On December 13 the division was assigned to the 13th Army in that Front. By the turn of the year it was back in the front line, and on January 3, 1944, liberated the town of Novograd- Volynskiy, for which it received its first Order of the Red Banner. In February the division was transferred to the 28th Rifle Corps of the 60th Army of the same Front. It was awarded its second Order of the Red Banner on March 19 for its role in the liberation of Starokostiantyniv and several other towns in the area. In July the 140th was reassigned to the 38th Army, and remained in this Army for the duration of the war. On August 10 the division was awarded the Order of Lenin for \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks\\" and its \\"valor and courage\\" in the liberation of Lvov, an unusual distinction for a regular rifle division. The 38th Army moved to the 4th Ukrainian Front in November, and the 140th remained in this Front for the duration, although it was bounced from one rifle corps to another during this time. Along with its Army, the division fought through the Carpathian Mountains and eastern Czechoslovakia during the winter and spring of 1945. During this operation the division commander, General Kiselyov, was killed in a German airstrike on January 24 while successfully directing the penetration of the strong German lines south of the Polish city of Iaslo.

It was recorded with the Trio Mocot√≥ band and released by Philips Records in September 1970, during a time of political tension in dictatorial Brazil. Its title comes from the Portuguese term meaning \\"brute force\\". The album introduced an acoustic samba-based music that is mellower, moodier, and less ornate than Ben's preceding work. Its largely unrehearsed, nighttime recording session found the singer improvising with Trio Mocot√≥'s groove-oriented accompaniment while experimenting with unconventional rhythmic arrangements, musical techniques, and elements of soul, funk, and rock. Ben's lyrics explore themes of romantic passion, melancholy, sensuality, and ‚Äì in a departure from the carefree sensibility of past releases ‚Äì identity politics and elements of postmodernism. A commercial and critical success, F√¥r√ßa Bruta established Ben as a leading artist in Brazil's Tropic√°lia movement and pioneered a unique sound later known as samba rock. In 2007, Rolling Stone Brasil named it the 61st greatest Brazilian music record. That same year, the album was released for the first time in the United States by the specialty label Dusty Groove America, attracting further critical recognition.  Background  In 1969, Jorge Ben re-signed to Philips Records after a four- year leave from the label due to creative differences and recorded his self- titled sixth album. It featured songs performed with Trio Mocot√≥ as his backing band; Ben had met the vocal/percussion group while touring the nightclub circuit in S√£o Paulo in the late 1960s.; . The band's members were Fritz Escov√£o (who played the cu√≠ca), Nereu Gargalo (tambourine), and Jo√£o Parahyba (drums and percussion). The album was a commercial comeback for Ben, and its success created a busy schedule for all four musicians.; This \\"hectic\\" period for them led music critic John Bush to believe it may have resulted in a relaxed recording of samba soul for F√¥r√ßa Bruta; fellow critic Tom Hull said Ben and Trio Mocot√≥ chose to \\"chill out at the after-party of Jorge Ben\\" and capture \\"the sound of pleasant exhaustion\\".; .  Recording and production  Correio da Manh√£ and later collected by the Brazilian National Archivesalt=A black and white photo of a man with an acoustic guitar, surrounded by three other men holding percussion instruments Ben regrouped with Trio Mocot√≥ in 1970 to record the album. They held one nighttime session without rehearsing most of the songs beforehand. According to Parahyba, this was intended to give listeners an impression of the mood that developed as they played in the studio. During the session, Ben first sang his vocal for a song before the accompanying instrumentation was recorded. He played the acoustic guitar for the instrumentals, and specifically the ten-string viola caipira for the songs \\"Aparece Aparecida\\" and \\"Mulher Brasileira\\".; . He also repurposed a tuning fork, a device traditionally used by musicians to maintain musical tuning among instruments; the singer instead stimulated it with his mouth to generate sounds that resembled a harmonica. For their part, Trio Mocot√≥ attempted to develop a distinctive groove with a rhythm that would suit the rock or \\"i√™-i√™-i√™\\" feel of Ben's guitar playing. The band played several percussion instruments, including the atabaque and bell plates. For \\"Charles Jr.\\" and other tracks, Parahyba used the whistle of his sister's electric toy train as a horn instrument, breaking it in the process. String and horn sections were recorded and included in the final mix but went uncredited in the album's packaging. It credited C.B.D. in Rio de Janeiro and Scatena in S√£o Paulo as the recording locations for F√¥r√ßa Bruta, which was named after the Portuguese for the phrase \\"brute force\\". According to Robert Leaver of Amoeba Music's international records department, \\"one can see a sly irony\\" in the title, considering the heightened political tension in dictatorial Brazil at the time and the gentle quality of Ben's music for the album.  Musical style  F√¥r√ßa Bruta has a pervasive sense of melancholy, according to Brazilian music scholar Pedro Alexandre Sanches. Songs that do not demonstrate this quality in their lyrics do so with their melodies, arrangements, and Ben's \\"devilish\\" guitar figures, with \\"Oba, L√° Vem Ela\\" and \\"Dom√™nica Domingava\\" cited by Sanches as examples. He identifies each composition on the album as either a samba, samba lament, or \\"samba-banzo\\", which in his opinion gives the record an idiosyncratic sense of contrast. Greg Caz, a disc jockey specializing in Brazilian music, believes F√¥r√ßa Bruta possesses a melancholic, mysterious quality that departs from the carefree sensibility that had been the singer's trademark. He also observes a heightened progression in Ben's idiosyncratic guitar playing. Music journalist Jacob McKean finds it subtle and \\"stripped down\\" when compared to Ben's previous music, with his guitar more prominently featured, his vocals \\"more intimate\\", and a \\"somewhat crunchy, folksy tone\\" established by the opening songs \\"Oba, L√° Vem Ela\\" and \\"Z√© Canjica\\". Songs such as the cu√≠ca-driven \\"O Telefone Tocou Novamente\\" and \\"Z√© Canjica\\", featuring a drum cadence, experiment with unconventional percussion arrangements, resulting in rhythmic contrasts between Trio Mocot√≥ and Ben's instruments.; . This rhythmic direction departs from his earlier music's innovative \\"chacatum, chacatum\\" beat, which had become popular and widely imitated by the time of the album. While still samba-based with hints of bossa nova, F√¥r√ßa Bruta adds understated funk and soul elements in the form of horn and string arrangements. Horn riffs are arranged in the style of S√©rgio Mendes on \\"Pulo, Pulo\\", in the style of Stax Records on \\"O Telefone Tocou Novamente\\", and on the title track, which appropriates the groove of the 1968 Archie Bell & the Drells song \\"Tighten Up\\". On \\"Mulher Brasileira\\", a string section is heard playing swirling patterns around Escov√£o's cu√≠ca, while the more uptempo rhythms of \\"Charles Jr.\\" and \\"Pulo, Pulo\\" are given contrast by more relaxed string melodies. Ben's singing provides further contrast and funk/soul qualities to the music. Along with his characteristic wails and croons, he exhibits a newfound raspy texture in his typically languid and nasal vocal.; . His singing also functions as an additional element of rhythm to some songs. According to Peter Margasak, Ben can be heard \\"reinforcing the rhythmic agility of his songs with pin-point phrasing, surprising intervallic leaps, and a plaintive kind of moan\\". On \\"Z√© Canjica\\" and \\"Charles Jr.\\", he improvises phrases (such as \\"Comanchero\\" and \\"the mama mama, the mama say\\") as rhythmic accompaniment during otherwise instrumental sections of the songs. The singer also implores the name of \\"Comanche\\" occasionally on the album. As Parahyba explains, it is a nickname given to him by Ben, who originally recorded it as a joke on \\"Charles Jr.\\" A different explanation came in the form of a lyric in Ben's 1971 song \\"Comanche\\": \\"My mother calls me / Comanche\\".; .  Lyrics and themes  Women are central figures in Ben's lyrics throughout the album, especially in \\"Mulher Brasileira\\", \\"Terezinha\\", and \\"Dom√™nica Domingava\\"; \\"Dom√™nica\\" is a variation on Domingas, the surname of his wife and muse Maria.; . His preoccupation with female characters led Sanches to identify F√¥r√ßa Brutas predominant theme as Ben's \\"Dionysian body\\", referring to the philosophical concept of a body that can submit to passionate chaos and suffering before overcoming itself.; . Several of the songs deal with romantic disappointment. In \\"Z√© Canjica\\", the narrator apologizes for being confused, sad, and moody while sending away a lover he feels he does not deserve. \\"O Telefone Tocou Novamente\\" expresses grief and pity over an angry lover ringing the phone of the narrator, who leaves to meet, only not to find her. During the song, Sanches observes a moment of catharsis by Ben, who raises his singing voice to an almost crying falsetto. Ben's lyrics also appropriates thematic devices from the popular imagination. Sanches compares the verses of the caipira-influenced samba \\"Apareceu Aparecida\\" and \\"Pulo, Pulo\\" to songs from ciranda, a traditional Brazilian children's dance. In \\"Apareceu Aparecida\\" ‚Äì which employs the \\"rolling stone\\" idiom ‚Äì the narrator rediscovers the euphoric joy of living after his beloved has accepted him again; this leads Sanches to conclude that Ben sings of hedonism in a concentrated state. Some songs feature expressions of political values. The nationalistic \\"Mulher Brasileira\\" celebrates Brazilian women regardless of their physical appearance and is cited by Brazilian journalist Gabriel Proiete de Souza as an early example of Ben's attempt to empower Afro-Brazilian women through his music. In Caz's opinion, the lyrics on F√¥r√ßa Bruta reveal deeper concerns than were found in the singer's previous recordings, shown most notably by \\"Charles Jr.\\", in which Ben explores his identity as an artist and as a black man. Brazilian music academic Rafael Lemos believes it demonstrates Ben's process of placing \\"black heritage into modernity\\", in the aftermath of slavery in Brazil and the continued marginalization of black people there. According to one translation of the lyrics, the narrator proclaims: post-slavery Brazil; O Negrinho (English: The Black Boy) by Jos√© Ferraz de Almeida J√∫nior shown abovealt=A pastel portrait of young black boy dressed in a white shirt \\"Charles Jr.\\" and other songs also use elements of postmodernism, such as self-reference, irony, and surrealism (as in the lyrics of \\"Pulo, Pulo\\"). Some of F√¥r√ßa Brutas characters and stories had appeared on Ben's earlier work, albeit in slightly different manifestations. On his 1969 album, \\"Charles\\" was depicted as a heroic Robin Hood-like figure of the country. The sensually primitive \\"Domingas\\" and \\"Teresa\\", also from the previous record, are rendered here as the more sophisticated \\"Dom√™nica\\" and the irreverent \\"Terezinha\\", respectively. Ben sings the latter song in an exceptionally nasal voice interpreted by Sanches as an ironic caricature of m√∫sica popular brasileira.  Release and reception  F√¥r√ßa Bruta was released by Philips in September 1970. It was received favorably in Veja magazine, whose reviewer found it impressively rhythmic, full of musical surprises and suspense, and comparable to a comic book in the way familiar fantasies and characters are reformulated in strange yet delightful directions. Commercially, it was a top-10 chart success in Brazil and produced the hit singles \\"O Telefone Tocou Novamente\\" and \\"Mulher Brasileira\\".; . Its success established Ben as an integral artist in Brazil's Tropic√°lia movement, led by fellow musicians Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. The following year on his next album, Negro √â Lindo (), Ben delved further into the black identity politics of \\"Charles Jr.\\" while retaining the melancholic musical quality of the previous record. F√¥r√ßa Brutas fusion of Trio Mocot√≥'s groove and Ben's more rockish guitar proved to be a distinctive feature of what critics and musicians later called samba rock. Its soul and funk elements, most prominent in the title track, helped earn the album a respected reputation among soul enthusiasts and rare-record collectors. In an interview for Guy Oseary's On the Record (2004), music entrepreneur and record collector Craig Kallman named F√¥r√ßa Bruta among his 15 favorite albums. Recording artist Beck also named it one of his favorite albums. Chicago headquarters and storefront of Dusty Groove America, F√¥r√ßa Brutas first American distributor In 2007, the album was re-released by Dusty Groove America, a specialty label in Chicago that reissued rare funk, jazz, soul, and Brazilian music titles in partnership with Universal Music.; . The reissue marked the first time the album had seen release in the United States. Dusty Groove asked Chicago Reader critic Peter Margasak to write liner notes for the release, but he declined, citing in part the lack of American literature available on Ben. New York-based retailer Other Music later named it the fourth best reissue of 2007 and one of Ben's \\"deepest, most emotional albums\\". That same year, F√¥r√ßa Bruta was ranked 61st on Rolling Stone Brasils list of the 100 greatest Brazilian albums. In an essay accompanying the ranking, journalist Marcus Preto called it the singer's most melancholy album. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, John Bush regarded F√¥r√ßa Bruta as one of Ben's best records and said it retained each musician's abilities over the course of \\"a wonderful acoustic groove that may have varied little but was all the better for its agreeable evenness\\". A reviewer for The Boston Globe said Ben's masterful performance of this music ‚Äì \\"a fusion of bright samba and mellow soul\\" ‚Äì still sounded original and essential nearly forty years after its recording; recommended even for non-Lusophones, it \\"transcends language and era with an organic vibe and breezy spontaneity\\". NOW Magazines Tim Perlich called it a \\"samba-soul heater\\", while Matthew Hickey from Turntable Kitchen deemed it \\"one of the most buoyantly textured and warmly melodic LPs ever recorded\\" and \\"Oba, L√° Vem Ela\\" among its \\"loveliest tunes\\".; . In Impose magazine, Jacob McKean highlighted the two opening tracks, finding \\"Z√© Canjica\\" particularly attractive, and believed \\"Apareceu Aparecida\\" features the album's most appealing hook. He also found Trio Mocot√≥ incomparable in their performance and the album elegant and exquisite overall, but added that Ben's nasally singing on \\"Terezinha\\" sounded unusual and the string section was given slightly too much emphasis on \\"Mulher Brasileira\\". Less enthusiastic about the album was Stylus Magazines Mike Powell, who said it has \\"a kind of aesthetic gentility\\" that characterizes Brazilian music and polarizes its listeners. Powell added that, while his cavil may be silly, F√¥r√ßa Bruta remains \\"demure samba-rock laced with sliding strings, an agreeable, samey atmosphere, no strife on the horizon\\". According to Peter Shapiro, it may be \\"too dainty\\" or not adventurous enough for some listeners, lacking the stylistically eclectic abandon of other Tropic√°lia music. But in his appraisal in The Wire, he judged the album to be \\"something of a minor masterpiece of textural contrast\\" and \\"a stone cold classic of Brazilian modernism\\", representative of the country's flair for \\"weaving beguiling syncretic music from practically any cloth\\". After discovering Ben's music in 2009, indie rock musician Andrew Bird wrote in a guest column for Time that F√¥r√ßa Bruta is a classic of \\"raw and soulful Tropic√°lia\\" and observed in Ben's singing a \\"pleading quality\\" that projects a simultaneous sense of melancholy and delight. Alynda Segarra of Hurray for the Riff Raff also listened to it while making her band's 2017 album The Navigator, later citing F√¥r√ßa Brutas string arrangements as an influence on her \\"cinematic\\" approach to the album's lyrics.

He married Elizabeth Jacobse Jansen Gardenier on February 4, 1683 in New York, United States Family Thomas Swartwout was the eldest son of Roelof Swartwout and Eva Brandt de Hooges and grandson of Tomys Swartwout. He was the brother of Antoni Swartwout & Bernardus Swartwout; brother in law to Jacob Kip; father of Jacobus Swartwout and grandfather of Brigadier General Jacobus Swartwout. Swartwout land patent 1697 Early settler of Delaware River Valley, founder of Deerpark, New York and Orange County, New York On October 14, 1697 Thomas Swartwout, along with his brothers Antoni and Bernardus were granted 1200 acres of Patent land along with Pierre Guimard, Jacques Caudebec, Jan Tyse and David Jamison on Magheckemeck or Wagheckemeck, later called the Peenpack patent. This is current day Deerpark, New York and Orange County, New York. There lands extended into present day New Jersey and the Delaware River and formed what is referred to as the Minisink Angle. The current borders of Ulster and Orange County, as well 3 state lines. New York‚ÄìNew Jersey border establishment Desiring to have verifiable evidence that their land lay within the bounds of the province of New York, Thomas Swartwout and his co- partners petitioned the General Assembly to take immediate action for the establishment of a boundary between New York and East Jersey. On November 1, 1700, the members of the House of Representatives collectively sent a petition to his Excellency Richard the Earl of Bellamont, governor of the province, setting \\"forth this request of the settlers in the Minnessinck\\" valley : \\"Whereas, some differences do arise between the county of Orange, within this province, and the province of East-New Jersey, [we] therefore humbly pray your excellency to take into your consideration the settling of the bounds between the province and the said province of East-New Jersey.\\" The same indefinite knowledge regarding the position of the boundary line between Orange and Ulster counties existed. In order to define the situation of Maghaghkemeck and that of Great and Little Minisink, the General Assembly, in 1701, enacted that that part of Orange County should be annexed immediately to the county of Ulster until the bounds between the two counties should be settled, and that in the interval the freeholders of the three districts should cast their votes for representatives in the County of Ulster \\"as if they actually lived in the said county.\\" It may further be remarked that the first boundary line separating the two counties extended across the territory of the present town of Deerpark not far south of the village of Huguenot to a point on \\"the northwardmost branch\\" of the Delaware River, near Sparrowbush. The boundary between the two provinces was surveyed and documented in 1769.Partition line ordered by the commissioners in 1769 On the death of Thomas Swartwout, about the year 1723, Samuel, his son, took charge of the family property.

According to physicians responsible for her care, her prognosis was \\"excellent\\" and she was expected to be medically discharged following the completion of her last infusion. The pharmacy where Emily was receiving her care was short staffed due to being a weekend, and the pharmacy computer system was down for maintenance. Furthermore, Emily's chemotherapy was entered incorrectly as a stat order, and the pharmacist and technician were behind on other hospital orders and unable to take their scheduled lunch break.http://www.freece.com/Files/Classroom/ProgramSlides/e4ece881-b65e-47dd- aab2-a98810a990c1/CURRENT_EmilysLawRevisit.pdf Etoposide is traditionally injected into a pre-prepared isotonic 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous bag (IV) for dilution prior to administration. However, the pharmacy technician incorrectly filled an empty IV bag with hypertonic 23.4% sodium chloride, then added the Etoposide resulting in a solution containing 26 times more sodium chloride than was recommended. After compounding the incorrect medication the IV was given to a pharmacist for sign-off, who failed to detect the medication error, and it was dispensed to hospital staff for administration. Upon administration Emily grabbed her head, cried out in pain, began vomiting, and slipped into a coma - she died three days later on March 1, 2006 after being taken off life support.

Westman and published by University of California Press (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London) in 2011 and in 2020 (paperback). The book is a broad historical overview of Europe's astronomical and astrological culture leading to Copernicus‚Äôs De revolutionibus and follows the scholarly debates that took place roughly over three generations after Copernicus. The British Journal for the History of Science, Vol. 46, pages 151-159.  Summary  In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus publicly defended his hypothesis that the earth is a planet and the sun a body resting near the center of a finite universe. This view challenged a long-held, widespread consensus about the order of the planets. But why did Copernicus make this bold proposal? And why did it matter? The Copernican Question revisits this pivotal moment in the history of science and puts political and cultural developments at the center rather than the periphery of the story. When Copernicus first hit on his theory around 1510, European society at all social levels was consumed with chronic warfare, the syphilis pandemic and recurrence of the bubonic plague, and, soon thereafter, Martin Luther‚Äôs break with the Catholic church. Apocalyptic prophecies about the imminent end of the world were rife; the relatively new technology of print was churning out reams of alarming astrological prognostications even as astrology itself came under serious attack in July 1496 from the Renaissance Florentine polymath Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494). Copernicus knew Pico‚Äôs work, possibly as early as the year of its publication in Bologna, the city in which he lived with the astrological prognosticator and astronomer, Domenico Maria di Novara (1454-1504). Against Pico‚Äôs multi-pronged critique, Copernicus sought to protect the credibility of astrology by reforming the astronomical foundations on which astrology rested. But, his new hypothesis came at the cost of introducing new uncertainties and engendering enormous resistance from traditionalists in the universities. Westman shows that efforts to answer Pico‚Äôs critique became a crucial unifying theme over the three generations of the first phase of what he calls the early modern scientific movement‚Äîa ‚Äúlong sixteenth century,‚Äù from the 1490s to the 1610s‚Äîthat laid the foundations for the great transformations in natural philosophy in the century that followed.  Central Themes, Patterns, Theses  1\\\\. To avoid projecting current classifications of knowledge onto the past, Westman argues that categories of knowledge and their meanings should be regarded as bound to time and place. In Copernicus‚Äôs lifetime (1473-1543) and well into the seventeenth century, astronomy and astrology constituted a compound subject, called ‚Äúthe science of the stars.‚Äù Each part of this disciplinary couple could be further subdivided into theoretical and practical parts. Authors who contributed to the literature of the heavens described themselves with various names that might look familiar but which no long carry currently specialized meanings, such as ‚Äúmathematician‚Äù or ‚Äúphysician and astronomer.‚Äù Westman uses ‚Äúastronomer- astrologer,‚Äù first coined by G√©rard Simon (Kepler astronome astrologue, Paris, 1979) and also his own term, ‚Äúheavenly practitioner‚Äù‚Äîterms of reference intended to be consistent with the historical agents‚Äô own self-designations. Similarly, he contends that historical actors located the topic of planetary order within the domains of theoretical astronomy and theoretical astrology‚Äîas opposed to their practical counterparts. 2\\\\. Copernicus‚Äôs initial turn to the heliocentric planetary arrangement occurred in the context of his encounter with Pico della Mirandola‚Äôs wide-ranging attack on the science of the stars and, in particular, Pico‚Äôs contention that astrologers did not agree about the order of the planets (Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem [Bologna: Benedictus Hectoris, 1496]). Copernicus was especially bothered by the uncertain ordering of Venus and Mercury. However, like Johannes Regiomontanus‚Äôs Epitome of Ptolemy‚Äôs Almagest (Venice, 1496), which was an important model for Copernicus, De revolutionibus (Nuremberg, 1543), astrology is nowhere mentioned in either work. 3\\\\. The controversy about the principles of astrological prognostication persisted as a major motive that drove debates about the heavens from the late fifteenth- to the early seventeenth century. Those debates took place within a nexus of political-cultural arrangements defined by the churches (both Catholic and Protestant), the universities and the royal, princely and imperial courts. At mid-sixteenth century Wittenberg, the Lutheran reformer university rector, Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560), advocated a theology that stressed divine presence in nature and prophetic or prognosticative activity as a natural, inborn human desire to know God‚Äôs works. Astronomer-astrologers at Wittenberg, most notably Erasmus Reinhold (1511-1553) and his many students, read De revolutionibus selectively, ignoring the re-ordering of the planets and, instead, extracted from Copernicus‚Äôs work those calculational models that could be geometrically transformed into the framework of a stationary earth. Superficially, this ‚ÄúWittenberg Interpretation‚Äù has sometimes been taken to refer to the methodological view known as ‚Äúinstrumentalism‚Äù‚Äîthat scientific theories are just useful instruments of prediction‚Äîbut Reinhold retained a ‚Äúrealist‚Äù view with respect to the solid spheres that carried the planets. 4\\\\. In the face of Pico‚Äôs critique there were different kinds of efforts to improve astrological prognostication during the sixteenth century and Copernicus‚Äôs proposal to reform theoretical astronomy was but one of them. 5\\\\. The appearance of unforeseen, singular, celestial novelties between 1572 and 1604 pushed a handful of astronomer-astrologers to consider whether alternative planetary orderings, including those of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), Nicolaus Reimars Baer (1551-1600) and Paul Wittich (1546-1586) could better explain the unanticipated phenomena. 6\\\\. This consideration of alternatives was the first major instance of underdetermination in the history of science (where the same observational evidence equally supports two, logically different hypotheses), although the historical agents were unaware of the epistemological generality of that problem. It resulted in new kinds of controversies and raised unprecedented questions about weighting the criteria for adjudicating among different hypotheses, including ancient authority, scriptural compatibility, simplicity, explanatory breadth, predictive accuracy and physical coherence. 7\\\\. The second generation followers of Copernicus (Michael Maestlin [1550-1631], Thomas Digges [1546-1595], Giordano Bruno [1548-1600], Christopher Rothmann [ca. 1550-1600]) did not constitute a socially- and intellectually-unified movement. And the failure of the high-profile third- generation proponents Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) and Galileo Galilei (1564-1638) to forge a cooperative and productive alliance around their defense of the Copernican theory is a particularly notable instance of this larger pattern of disunity. 8\\\\. Shared social context underdetermined the adoption of new theoretical claims. Many Copernicans, for example, were attracted to court settings because those spaces were more open to novelty than traditional university settings. But while court patronage allowed for rhetorical and philosophical diversity, it fails to explain why particular figures, like Galileo, adopted specific theoretical claims, such as the Copernican hypothesis. 9\\\\. Galileo‚Äôs famous telescopic claims can be thought of as introducing the discovery of recurrent novelties into the debate about alternative hypotheses. Unlike novas and comets, which seemed to appear only when God wanted to send a message, a human being with an instrument could make phenomena like the moon‚Äôs rough surface, never-before-seen distant stars or Jupiter‚Äôs ‚Äòplanets‚Äô appear and disappear. Success in convincing others of the reality of these phenomena occurred largely through print rather than by live demonstrations with the instrument. 10\\\\. The main social locus of change of belief was not some twentieth-century-like ‚Äúscientific community,‚Äù but the master-disciple relationship that was rooted in the all-male-cultures of the universities and modeled on the paternalistic structures of the family. 11\\\\. The Copernican Question proposes a new periodization that argues for an ‚Äúearly modern scientific movement‚Äù‚Äîchronologically, a ‚ÄúLong Sixteenth Century‚Äù that began with the late-fifteenth century conflict about the status of astrological prognostication and ended in the early seventeenth century when the Catholic Church extended its skepticism (and its enforcement machinery) about naturalistic foreknowledge to the reality of the heliocentric planetary ordering. Rather than revolutionary, paradigmatic rupture, this periodization offers a picture of gradual, multi-generational change that broadly conjoins a backward-looking veneration for ancient tradition with a forward-looking, modernizing valuation of change and novelty. 12\\\\. Kepler‚Äô Epitome of Copernican Astronomy (1618‚Äì21) and Galileo‚Äôs Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632) consolidated a critical mass of novel physical claims and arguments developed between the 1580s and the telescopic discoveries of 1610-13. While Kepler and Galileo disagreed on some important issues (Galileo, for example, never accepted Kepler‚Äôs elliptical orbits), together their presentations made possible a multifaceted, robust public debate (1620s-40s) that a new generation of modernizing natural philosophers‚Äîincluding Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650), Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655), Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), and Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)‚Äîselectively incorporated into their own original arguments with tradition-bound natural philosophers in the universities. In this period, the Copernican Question became a struggle that overtly involved natural philosophy, a battle framed as one between competing ‚Äúworld systems‚Äù. 13\\\\. By 1651, the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli (1598-1651), writing in the shadow of Galileo‚Äôs Trial in 1633, produced a massive work (Almagestum novum) in which he assembled 49 arguments in favor of the daily and annual motions of the Earth as against 77 arguments contrary to the Earth‚Äôs motions. While presenting the decision between the two as a contrasting of probable arguments, in the end, he decisively eliminated any uncertainty by appeal to ‚Äúboth sacred authority and Divine Scriptures.‚Äù 14\\\\. Although the midcentury modernizers were all followers of Copernicus‚Äôs system, like the late-sixteenth defenders of Copernicus, they continued to be disunified in the kinds of principles and arguments to which they appealed. For example, a proposal that side-stepped the difficult technical arguments grounding Kepler‚Äôs ellipses and Galileo‚Äôs falling bodies and which helped to popularize support with new audiences was the argument for a plurality of worlds. Building on Giordano Bruno‚Äôs claim that God must have used his omnipotence to create an infinite universe with innumerable worlds and Galileo‚Äôs telescopic discovery of a moon with Earthlike characteristics, John Wilkins argued that an infinite, omnipotent god must have used his power to create other living beings to occupy a plurality of other sun-centered worlds. In his Discovery of a World in the Moone (1638), Wilkins broached the probability of an Earthlike moon with lunar inhabitants, the dark areas interpreted as seas, the entire body surrounded by a vaporous atmosphere. The existence of Lunatics was further testimony to the divine wisdom. And the pluralist argument became a significant resource for attracting adherents to a multiplicity of sun-centered systems in an infinite universe. 15\\\\. In England, prominent midcentury astrologers like Vincent Wing (1619-1668) and Thomas Streete (1621?-1689) learned their Copernicus through Kepler and Descartes and associated the accuracy of their predictions with Kepler‚Äôs Rudolfine Tables (1627). 16\\\\. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Robert Hooke (1635-1702) were members of a generation that encountered the Copernican Question not directly through Copernicus‚Äôs De revolutionibus but as a controversy already matured and refracted through the midcentury literature of the heavens and natural philosophy. Newton himself made his earliest acquaintance with the Copernican ordering and Kepler‚Äôs elliptical orbits through the astronomer-astrologers Wing and Streete. Ultimately, however, he rejected the claims of astrology as a form of idolatry, much as did Pico‚Äîbased upon the projection of human qualities onto the stars and planets‚Äîand contrary to Newton‚Äôs belief in the power of God to act directly in the world without need of intermediaries. However, like Copernicus, Newton never published his views about astrology. 16\\\\. The problem of closure. Westman argues that ‚Äúthe diversity already evident at the beginning of the [seventeenth] century persisted among Copernicus‚Äôs midcentury followers. To identify oneself publicly with the Copernican arrangement or to declare its truth did not entail allegiance to the uniform set of commitments in natural philosophy evoked by the nineteenth- and twentieth century term ‚ÄúCopernicanism‚Äù. The Copernican question achieved closure‚Äîan end to questioning and criticism from competing alternatives‚Äîin different ways among different audiences. These endings occurred through no single proof and with audiences as variously overlapping as almanac readers, practicing astrologers, planetary table makers, extraterrestrializers, itinerant scientific lecturers and, of course, philosophizing astronomers and high-end, new-style natural philosophers.‚Äù 17\\\\. Newton‚Äôs powerful achievement was his construction of a natural philosophy of mathematizable forces in which the sun‚Äôs position at or near the center of the planets could be deduced rather than assumed as a premise, as Copernicus had done: ‚ÄúThe Copernican system is proved a priori,‚Äù Newton wrote, ‚Äúfor if the common center of gravity is calculated for any position of the planets it either falls in the body of the Sun or will always be very close to it.‚Äù And, unlike Copernicus, Tycho Brahe or Kepler in the long sixteenth century, he made no effort to fix astrology.

The film stars Sam Claflin, Max Irons and Douglas Booth. It is set among the Riot Club, a fictional all-male, exclusive dining club at the University of Oxford. When the play Posh premiered, the Riot Club was often described as a thinly veiled version of the real-life Bullingdon Club, although according to Wade it is entirely fictitious. Synopsis Alistair (Sam Claflin) and Miles (Max Irons), both with aristocratic connections, start their first year at Oxford University. Miles is friendly and level-headed, cordially offering to switch rooms when Alistair's assigned room does not meet with his parents' approval, and beginning a relationship with Lauren (Holliday Grainger), who has a working-class, Northern background. Alistair is an insecure, arrogant and cold-hearted snob. The two are tutorial partners at Oxford, where Alistair is blatant in his contempt for Miles and his left-leaning politics. The Riot Club, a long-established exclusive drinking club priding itself on hedonism and the belief that money can buy anything, is on the hunt for new members to maintain its roster of ten men, all of whom must be educated at private school. Alistair is invited by Harry, whom he has met during the start of their term. Miles, who was out drinking in the pub, is invited by Hugo, another Riot Club member. Hugo is out, and he and Miles exchange charged looks throughout the film. Alistair finds a new friend in Harry, who introduces him to his Uncle Jeremy (Tom Hollander), a senior Conservative MP‚Äîwhich Alistair himself aspires to be one day. After undergoing an unpleasant initiation, both Miles and Alistair become members of the Riot Club. Having been barred from most establishments in Oxford, the club have their annual dinner at the function room in a country pub. Alistair and Miles are both surprised to see each other there, Alistair showing open disdain. The Club begin their dinner, and though the landlord is initially excited to have a wealthy, aristocratic party dining at his establishment, their raucous behaviour annoys the pub's other patrons, some of whom leave. Chris, the landlord, is put off by their behaviour and tells them that they are disrupting his business; the boys settle with an arrangement with him paying for his losses to let them continue to stay, which he reluctantly accepts. After the escort Harry hired refuses to perform group oral sex, Alistair takes Miles' phone and texts Lauren without Miles knowing. Lauren then shows up to the pub to the surprise of Miles, whom the boys promptly proposition to do what the escort would not. Hurt that Miles did nothing while they insulted her, Lauren then attempts to leave the pub, but is assaulted by one of the members. Miles struggles to rescue her as the other members hold him back. Hugo intervenes and orders the boys to let her leave, which she does. Miles, drunk and seemingly depressed after what happened to Lauren, stays quiet for the rest of the night, while Alistair works up the rest with his political ideals of the rich and the poor. Getting progressively more drunk and ingesting drugs, they start to wreck the room. When Chris comes to confront them, Alistair insults Chris by giving him money which he does not accept, telling them they are no better than a bunch of kids breaking shop windows and that they are just spoiled brats. Alistair punches him followed by the others who viciously attack him until he becomes unconscious. While the members become frantic realizing what they just have done, Miles calls for an ambulance. The boys are all arrested but believing that the club is more important than the individual, they agree not to give statements. The club meet after the incident and agree that Miles, as the newest club member, should take the blame for the attack on Chris. Miles tries to apologise to Lauren, who tells him to never talk to her again. Later, Chris's skin is then found underneath Alistair's fingernails, meaning they can arrest and charge him. Alistair is sent down (expelled) from Oxford, being the only one arrested for the incident, whilst the rest were allowed to continue their studies without any criminal charges. After a talk with the dean, Miles is approached by the new president of the Riot Club (Guy Bellingfield) to re- join next year, but after nearly having to leave university because of the scandal, he decides to leave the club, a decision which the new president mocks. Alistair is invited to a meeting with Jeremy in London, who asks for the Riot Club to be kept out of future court appearances, and assures Alistair that in spite of being kicked out of Oxford, the boy is still a Riot member. Though Alistair is at first aggressively dismissive of Jeremy's proposed assistance, Alistair is brought around when Jeremy offers the boy a position in his office and an assured future. The film concludes with Alistair leaving the meeting with Jeremy, a smug smile on his face as he walks down the street. Cast * Sam Claflin as Alistair Ryle, a first-year history student whose brother, Sebastian, was considered a 'legendary' member of the Riot Club. Alistair is politically right, leading to intense conflict and rivalry with Miles. Alistair attended Harrow School, unlike his brother, who attended Eton College. * Max Irons as Miles 'Milo' Richards, a first-year history student who joins the Riot Club. Miles is the eldest of his siblings and possesses the courtesy title of 'the honourable' which implies that his father is either a Viscount, Baron, or Life Peer. Miles is politically left and becomes disillusioned and frustrated with the actions of his club mates. He attended Westminster School. * Douglas Booth as Harry Villiers, an older, charismatic student whose family is quite wealthy, though they partially maintain this by allowing tourists to view their home, something which deeply rankles Harry. His uncle, Jeremy, was previously a member of the Riot Club. Educated at Eton. * Jessica Brown Findlay as Rachel, daughter of Chris and a waitress at his pub. * Holliday Grainger as Lauren, a Northern first-year student from a working class family who enters into a relationship with Miles at the start of the film. She is incredibly northern and working class. * Freddie Fox as James Leighton-Masters, the president of the club; he is criticised by the other members of the club for scaling back the club's activities in an effort to not jeopardize his future. Educated at St Pauls.Wade, Laura. Posh: Script and screenplay (2010). \\"James Leighton-Masters character card\\". * Ben Schnetzer as Dimitri Mitropoulos, an older student of Greek heritage who seems to act as the club's primary bankroll. It is also suggested that Dimitri is nouveau riche. He appears to have a close friendship with Guy Bellingfield, though it is the very same member who constantly mocks Dimitri and his heritage. Educated at Eton, where he met and became friends with Bellingfield. * Natalie Dormer as Charlie, an escort hired by Harry. * Gordon Brown as Chris, owner of the pub where the club has their dinner. * Sam Reid as Hugo Fraser-Tyrwhitt, an older student whose family, although established members of the gentry, is not financially well-off. He was at least a couple of years Miles' senior at Westminster and although they did not socialize, Miles remembers Hugo composing limericks in Latin, something which is implied got him bullied. Hugo is homosexual, and has a romantic interest in Miles. * Matthew Beard as Guy Bellingfield, an older student who makes no secret of his desire to succeed James as president of the club. He is close friends with Dimitri, though he often makes jokes about his Greek heritage. He presents himself as very enthusiastic with little to no regard for any serious matters. Educated at Eton. * Tom Hollander as Jeremy Villiers MP, Harry's uncle and a successful Conservative MP. In the play, he is Guy's godfather. * Jack Farthing as George Balfour, a 'country gentleman' from an old landowning family. Similar to his counterpart Hugo, it is implied that his family might not be financially well- off. George displays enthusiastic interest and knowledge in farming, hunting, game, and llamas.

It combines multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technology, which multiplies capacity by transmitting different signals over multiple antennas, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which divides a radio channel into a large number of closely spaced subchannels to provide more reliable communications at high speeds. Research conducted during the mid-1990s showed that while MIMO can be used with other popular air interfaces such as time-division multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple access (CDMA), the combination of MIMO and OFDM is most practical at higher data rates. MIMO-OFDM is the foundation for most advanced wireless local area network (wireless LAN) and mobile broadband network standards because it achieves the greatest spectral efficiency and, therefore, delivers the highest capacity and data throughput. Greg Raleigh invented MIMO in 1996 when he showed that different data streams could be transmitted at the same time on the same frequency by taking advantage of the fact that signals transmitted through space bounce off objects (such as the ground) and take multiple paths to the receiver. That is, by using multiple antennas and precoding the data, different data streams could be sent over different paths. Raleigh suggested and later proved that the processing required by MIMO at higher speeds would be most manageable using OFDM modulation, because OFDM converts a high-speed data channel into a number of parallel lower-speed channels. Operation In modern usage, the term \\"MIMO\\" indicates more than just the presence of multiple transmit antennas (multiple input) and multiple receive antennas (multiple output). While multiple transmit antennas can be used for beamforming, and multiple receive antennas can be used for diversity, the word \\"MIMO\\" refers to the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals (spatial multiplexing) to multiply spectral efficiency (capacity). Traditionally, radio engineers treated natural multipath propagation as an impairment to be mitigated. MIMO is the first radio technology that treats multipath propagation as a phenomenon to be exploited. MIMO multiplies the capacity of a radio link by transmitting multiple signals over multiple, co-located antennas. This is accomplished without the need for additional power or bandwidth. Space‚Äìtime codes are employed to ensure that the signals transmitted over the different antennas are orthogonal to each other, making it easier for the receiver to distinguish one from another. Even when there is line of sight access between two stations, dual antenna polarization may be used to ensure that there is more than one robust path. OFDM enables reliable broadband communications by distributing user data across a number of closely spaced, narrowband subchannels. This arrangement makes it possible to eliminate the biggest obstacle to reliable broadband communications, intersymbol interference (ISI). ISI occurs when the overlap between consecutive symbols is large compared to the symbols‚Äô duration. Normally, high data rates require shorter duration symbols, increasing the risk of ISI. By dividing a high-rate data stream into numerous low-rate data streams, OFDM enables longer duration symbols. A cyclic prefix (CP) may be inserted to create a (time) guard interval that prevents ISI entirely. If the guard interval is longer than the delay spread‚Äîthe difference in delays experienced by symbols transmitted over the channel‚Äîthen there will be no overlap between adjacent symbols and consequently no intersymbol interference. Though the CP slightly reduces spectral capacity by consuming a small percentage of the available bandwidth, the elimination of ISI makes it an exceedingly worthwhile tradeoff. A key advantage of OFDM is that fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) may be used to simplify implementation. Fourier transforms convert signals back and forth between the time domain and frequency domain. Consequently, Fourier transforms can exploit the fact that any complex waveform may be decomposed into a series of simple sinusoids. In signal processing applications, discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) are used to operate on real-time signal samples. DFTs may be applied to composite OFDM signals, avoiding the need for the banks of oscillators and demodulators associated with individual subcarriers. Fast Fourier transforms are numerical algorithms used by computers to perform DFT calculations. FFTs also enable OFDM to make efficient use of bandwidth. The subchannels must be spaced apart in frequency just enough to ensure that their time-domain waveforms are orthogonal to each other. In practice, this means that the subchannels are allowed to partially overlap in frequency. MIMO-OFDM is a particularly powerful combination because MIMO does not attempt to mitigate multipath propagation and OFDM avoids the need for signal equalization. MIMO-OFDM can achieve very high spectral efficiency even when the transmitter does not possess channel state information (CSI). When the transmitter does possess CSI (which can be obtained through the use of training sequences), it is possible to approach the theoretical channel capacity. CSI may be used, for example, to allocate different size signal constellations to the individual subcarriers, making optimal use of the communications channel at any given moment of time. More recent MIMO-OFDM developments include multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), higher order MIMO implementations (greater number of spatial streams), and research concerning massive MIMO and cooperative MIMO (CO-MIMO) for inclusion in coming 5G standards. MU-MIMO is part of the IEEE 802.11ac standard, the first Wi-Fi standard to offer speeds in the gigabit per second range. MU-MIMO enables an access point (AP) to transmit to up to four client devices simultaneously. This eliminates contention delays, but requires frequent channel measurements to properly direct the signals. Each user may employ up to four of the available eight spatial streams. For example, an AP with eight antennas can talk to two client devices with four antennas, providing four spatial streams to each. Alternatively, the same AP can talk to four client devices with two antennas each, providing two spatial streams to each. Multi-user MIMO beamforming even benefits single spatial stream devices. Prior to MU-MIMO beamforming, an access point communicating with multiple client devices could only transmit to one at a time. With MU-MIMO beamforming, the access point can transmit to up to four single stream devices at the same time on the same channel. The 802.11ac standard also supports speeds up to 6.93 Gbit/s using eight spatial streams in single-user mode. The maximum data rate assumes use of the optional 160 MHz channel in the 5 GHz band and 256 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation). Chipsets supporting six spatial streams have been introduced and chipsets supporting eight spatial streams are under development. Massive MIMO consists of a large number of base station antennas operating in a MU-MIMO environment. While LTE networks already support handsets using two spatial streams, and handset antenna designs capable of supporting four spatial streams have been tested, massive MIMO can deliver significant capacity gains even to single spatial stream handsets. Again, MU- MIMO beamforming is used to enable the base station to transmit independent data streams to multiple handsets on the same channel at the same time. However, one question still to be answered by research is: When is it best to add antennas to the base station and when is it best to add small cells? Another focus of research for 5G wireless is CO-MIMO. In CO-MIMO, clusters of base stations work together to boost performance. This can be done using macro diversity for improved reception of signals from handsets or multi-cell multiplexing to achieve higher downlink data rates. However, CO-MIMO requires high-speed communication between the cooperating base stations. History Gregory Raleigh was first to advocate the use of MIMO in combination with OFDM. In a theoretical paper, he proved that with the proper type of MIMO system‚Äîmultiple, co-located antennas transmitting and receiving multiple information streams using multidimensional coding and encoding‚Äîmultipath propagation could be exploited to multiply the capacity of a wireless link. Up to that time, radio engineers tried to make real-world channels behave like ideal channels by mitigating the effects of multipath propagation. However, mitigation strategies have never been fully successful. In order to exploit multipath propagation, it was necessary to identify modulation and coding techniques that perform robustly over time-varying, dispersive, multipath channels. Raleigh published additional research on MIMO-OFDM under time- varying conditions, MIMO-OFDM channel estimation, MIMO-OFDM synchronization techniques, and the performance of the first experimental MIMO-OFDM system. Raleigh solidified the case for OFDM by analyzing the performance of MIMO with three leading modulation techniques in his PhD dissertation: quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), and discrete multi-tone (DMT). QAM is representative of narrowband schemes such as TDMA that use equalization to combat ISI. DSSS uses rake receivers to compensate for multipath and is used by CDMA systems. DMT uses interleaving and coding to eliminate ISI and is representative of OFDM systems. The analysis was performed by deriving the MIMO channel matrix models for the three modulation schemes, quantifying the computational complexity and assessing the channel estimation and synchronization challenges for each. The models showed that for a MIMO system using QAM with an equalizer or DSSS with a rake receiver, computational complexity grows quadratically as data rate is increased. In contrast, when MIMO is used with DMT, computational complexity grows log-linearly (i.e., n log n) as data rate is increased. Raleigh subsequently founded Clarity Wireless in 1996 and Airgo Networks in 2001 to commercialize the technology. Clarity developed specifications in the Broadband Wireless Internet Forum (BWIF) that led to the IEEE 802.16 (commercialized as WiMAX) and LTE standards, both of which support MIMO. Airgo designed and shipped the first MIMO-OFDM chipsets for what became the IEEE 802.11n standard. MIMO-OFDM is also used in the 802.11ac standard and is expected to play a major role in 802.11ax and fifth generation (5G) mobile phone systems. Several early papers on multi-user MIMO were authored by Ross Murch et al. at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. MU-MIMO was included in the 802.11ac standard (developed starting in 2011 and approved in 2014). MU-MIMO capacity appears for the first time in what have become known as \\"Wave 2\\" products. Qualcomm announced chipsets supporting MU-MIMO in April 2014. Broadcom introduced the first 802.11ac chipsets supporting six spatial streams for data rates up to 3.2 Gbit/s in April 2014. Quantenna says it is developing chipsets to support eight spatial streams for data rates up to 10 Gbit/s. Massive MIMO, Cooperative MIMO (CO-MIMO), and HetNets (heterogeneous networks) are currently the focus of research concerning 5G wireless. The development of 5G standards is expected to begin in 2016. Prominent researchers to date include Jakob Hoydis (of Alcatel-Lucent), Robert W. Heath (at the University of Texas at Austin), Helmut B√∂lcskei (at ETH Zurich), and David Gesbert (at EURECOM). Trials of 5G technology have been conducted by Samsung. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo plans to trial 5G technology in collaboration with Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Fujitsu, NEC, Nokia, and Samsung.
