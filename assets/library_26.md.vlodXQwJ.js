He was the general secretary of the Communist Party of India from 1935–47. Early years Joshi was born on 14 April 1907, in a Kumaoni Hindu family of Almora,in Uttarakhand. His father Harinandan Joshi was a teacher. In 1928, he passed his M.A. examination from the Allahabad University. Soon, he became the General secretary of the Workers and Peasants Party of Uttar Pradesh, formed at Meerut in October 1928. In 1929, at the age of 22, the British Government arrested him as one of the suspects of the Meerut Conspiracy Case. The other early communist leaders who were arrested along with him included Shaukat Usmani, Muzaffar Ahmed, S.A. Dange and G.V. Ghate. (From left to right) Muzaffar Ahmed, Bankim Mukherjee, PC Joshi, Somnath Lahiri at Calcutta 1937 Joshi was given six years of transportation to the penal settlement of Andaman Islands. Considering his age, the punishment was later reduced to three. After his release in 1933, Joshi worked towards bringing a number of groups under the banner of the Communist Party of India (CPI). In 1934 the CPI was admitted to the Third International or Comintern. As the General Secretary Portrait of 25 of the Meerut Prisoners taken outside the jail. Back row (left to right): K. N.

After the sudden arrest of Somnath Lahiri, then Secretary of CPI, during end-1935, Joshi became the new General Secretary. He thus became the first general secretary of Communist Party of India, for a period from 1935 to 1947. At that time the left movement was steadily growing and the British government banned communist activities from 1934 to 1938. In February 1938, when the Communist Party of India started in Bombay its first legal organ, the National Front, Joshi became its editor. The Raj re-banned the CPI in 1939, for its initial anti-War stance. When, in 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, the CPI proclaimed that the nature of the war has changed to a people's war against fascism. Expulsion and rehabilitation In the post-freedom period, the Communist Party of India, after the second congress in Calcutta (new spelling: Kolkata) adopted a path of taking up arms. Joshi was advocating unity with Indian National Congress under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru. He was severely criticized in the Calcutta congress of the CPI in 1948 and was removed from the general secretaryship. Subsequently, he was suspended from the Party on 27 January 1949, expelled in December 1949 and readmitted to the Party on 1 June 1951. Gradually he was sidelined, though rehabilitated through making him the editor of the Party weekly, New Age. After the Communist Party of India split, he was with the CPI. Though he explained the policy of the CPI in the 7th congress in 1964, he was never brought in the leadership directly. Last days In his last days, he kept himself busy in research and publication works in Jawaharlal Nehru University to establish an archive on the Indian communist movement. Personal life In 1943, he married Kalpana Datta (1913–1995), a revolutionary, who participated in the Chittagong armoury raid. They had two sons, Chand and Suraj. Chand Joshi (1946-2000) was a noted journalist, who worked for the Hindustan Times. He was also known for his work, Bhindranwale: Myth and Reality (1985). Chand's second wife Manini (née Chatterjee, b 1961) is also a journalist, who works for The Telegraph.

Developed at Paraná, Everson moved to Europe in 1997, spending time some time with Girondins de Bordeaux, Paris Saint-Germain and Servette. After three years in Germany, he signed with Nice in 2002, where he had the best period of his career, playing over 60 league games in two seasons, scoring eleven times. In 2004, he moved to Benfica but found it difficult to break into the starting eleven, partially because of injuries. After three years there, intercalated between playing for the reserves, a loan deal with Young Boys, or not competing at all, he left for Neuchâtel Xamax in 2007. He represented three more teams before retiring in 2011. Career Born in Campo Grande, Everson began his youth career at Portuguesa de Desportos in 1989, followed by a six-year spell at Paraná. After a few months with América (SP) in early 1997, he moved to Girondins de Bordeaux to play for their reserve team in the CFA, scoring 16 goals in 9 matches. That record attracted the interest of Paris Saint-Germain, who signed him that same year. After some training sessions with Ricardo Gomes, PSG sold him to Servette, where he stayed until the end of 1997. He then joined RWDM Brussels in the start of 1998, and stayed there for 18 months, a period he said it turned him into an adult. In the summer of 1999, Everson moved to German football and spent three years there, two of those in the regional leagues, first at Eintracht Braunschweig, then Arminia Bielefeld and finally VfL Osnabrück. In 2002, he joined the freshly promoted Nice, and became an undisputed starter, playing 60 matches over two seasons, scoring eleven goals, seven from free-kicks. His performances led to a move to Benfica, who signed him on a four-year contract in July 2004. Record wrote that Benfica paid Nice €1.2M to sign him. Everson was described by his former teammate, Lilian Laslandes as a strong, tactically disciplined player that could operate either as defensive or central midfielder; and possessed a powerful left foot. Although, there was concerns that he was still suffering from a pubalgia brought from Nice, he was declared match-fit on 9 August, and made his debut for Benfica in the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira against Porto. His first start happened in late October, in a home win against Oriental for the Taça de Portugal, followed by 11 minutes against Vitória de Setúbal, in his Primeira Liga debut. However, after months of light treatment to his pubalgia, it was decided that he needed surgery, so he was operated in mid December. with full recovery in a month. After overcoming the injury, Everson was called up by Giovanni Trapattoni on some occasions, but did not play again. Because of the 11 minutes played with Setúbal, he too won the league title. The following season, Everson was expected to remain with the first-team, but he was deemed surplus by Ronald Koeman, and ultimately demoted to the reserve team. After half a season competing in the third tier, he was loaned to BSC Young Boys for the remainder of the season. At Young Boys, Everson helped them reach the Swiss Cup Final, which they lost to FC Sion on penalties. He returned to Benfica in the following season and spent the entire season without competing. In July 2007, he moved to Neuchâtel Xamax on a permanent deal, scoring his first goal on 1 September, against Grasshopper. After leaving Neuchâtel Xamax, he played briefly at Étoile du Sahel, returned to Germany to play for TuS Koblenz, and closed his career at age 34, in Gueugnon. In 2011, Everson returned to Nice to work in their media department; he regularly appears as a host and interviewer in videos on the official website.

It lies between the neighborhoods of Georgetown and Foggy Bottom in Northwest Washington, D.C. The non-arched design of the bridge contrasts with that of all the other bridges rising over the parkway.Davis, Timothy (1992). History and Description, pp. 12, 89, 91 History The original wooden bridge at the site was the first bridge in the current District of Columbia, being constructed in 1788 by the City of Georgetown two years before it was incorporated into the District. The bridge reportedly collapsed during a severe storm, leading to a legend that the ghosts of a stagecoach driver and his horses that drowned in the collapse could be seen thereafter, still attempting to cross the bridge. It was replaced by a heavy wooden drawbridge in 1800, as Rock Creek was at that time wide and deep enough that sailing ships needed to transit the bridge, although the creek became unnavigable by the 1830s due to silt from upstream construction and agricultural uses, as well as construction of a quay obstructing the mouth of the creek. A covered wooden bridge replaced the drawbridge in 1839, followed by a steel-truss bridge in 1871, which was closed in 1925 because it had become structurally unsound. Remnants of the western abutment of the 1871 bridge still exist adjacent to that of the current bridge. Design The current bridge was originally contemplated as a steel-girder bridge for reasons of cost and the belief that an arch bridge could not be built large enough to accommodate the parkway, then in planning, running underneath it. The bridge was one of the few to be designed solely by the office of the District of Columbia Engineer of Bridges without input from an outside private firm. The United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), the agency tasked with reviewing architectural projects in the capital, under Charles Moore opposed the design because it did not conform with the other park bridges, which were designed to harmonize with their surroundings. The designers attempted to compromise by encasing the bridge in concrete and adding ornamentation, but Moore was not appeased, calling the new design \\"a brutal bridge, entirely inconsistent with any other parkway treatment,\\" and stating that \\"the design is fundamentally bad. A bridge constructed along such lines would be a perpetual eyesore.\\" Moore also objected that adding ornamentation would not satisfy the fundamental design principles perceived to be lacking in the bridge. The D.C. Board of Commissioners decided to go ahead with the design despite the formal disapproval of the CFA, since the legislation authorizing the bridge specified a steel-girder design, and only mandated consultation with the CFA but did not require that their recommendations be followed. This situation led to the passage of the Shipstead-Luce Act in 1930, which gave the commission legal authority to enforce their decisions. The bridge was constructed in 1929 and 1930.

It won the Seiun Award for best translated novel, and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel, the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. The novel follows a crew of astronauts sent out as the third wave, following two series of probes, to investigate a trans- Neptunian Kuiper belt comet dubbed 'Burns-Caulfield' that has been found to be transmitting an unidentified radio signal to an as-yet unknown destination elsewhere in the solar system, followed by their subsequent first contact. The novel explores questions of identity, consciousness, free will, artificial intelligence, neurology, game theory as well as evolution and biology. Blindsight is available online under a Creative Commons license.c Its sequel (or “sidequel”) Echopraxia came out in 2014. In October 2020 a Blindsight short film was released.https://blindsight.space/ It is a non-commercial adaptation of the novel. As Peter Watts describes it himself: “snatches of Blindsight recalled by Siri Keeton during one of his waking interludes in the aftermath of that novel. Spectacular highlights arranged in reverse order, Memento-like”.https://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=9489 Plot In the year 2082, thousands of large, coordinated objects of an unknown origin, dubbed \\"Fireflies\\", burn up in the Earth's atmosphere in a precise grid, while momentarily broadcasting across an immense portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, catching humanity off guard and alerting it to an undeniable extraterrestrial presence. It is suspected that the entire planet has been surveyed in one effective sweep. Despite the magnitude of this 'Firefall', human politics soon return to normal. Years afterwards, a comet-surveying satellite stumbles across a radio transmission originating from a comet, subsequently named 'Burns-Caulfield'. This tight-beam broadcast is directed to an unknown location and in fact does not intersect the Earth at any point. As this is the first opportunity to learn more about the extraterrestrials, three waves of ships are sent out: the first being light probes shot out for an as- soon-as-possible flyby of the comet, then a wave of heavier but better- equipped probes, and finally a crewed ship, the Theseus. Theseus is propelled by an antimatter reactor and captained by an artificial intelligence. It carries a crew of five cutting-edge transhuman hyper-specialists of whom one is a genetically reincarnated vampire and acts as the nominal mission commander. While the crew is in hibernation en route, the just-arrived second wave of probes commence a compounded radar scan of the subsurface of Burns- Caulfield, but this immediately causes the object to self-destruct. Theseus is re-routed mid-flight to the new-found destination of the signal: a previously undetected sub-brown dwarf deep in the Oort Cloud, dubbed 'Big Ben'. The crew wakes from hibernation while the Theseus closes on Big Ben. They discover a giant, concealed object in the vicinity, and assume it to be a vessel of some kind. As soon as the crew uncloaks the vessel, it immediately hails them over radio and, in a range of languages varying from English to Chinese, identifies itself as 'Rorschach'. They determine that Rorschach must have learned human languages by eavesdropping on comm-chatter since its arrival, sometime after the Broadcast Age began. Over the course of a few days many questions and answers are exchanged by both parties. Eventually Susan James, the linguist, determines that 'Rorschach' doesn't really understand what either party is actually saying. Theseus probes Rorschach and finds it to have hollow sections, some with atmosphere, all filled with levels of radiation that render remote operation of machinery virtually impossible and would kill a human in a matter of hours. Despite this and over Rorschach's objections the whole crew except the mission commander enters and explores in a series of short forays, using the ship's advanced medical facilities to recover from the damage the radiation inflicts on their bodies. They discover the presence of highly evasive, fast-moving 9-legged organisms dubbed 'Scramblers', of which they kill one and capture two for study. The 'Scramblers' appear to have orders of magnitude more brainpower than human beings but use most of it simply to operate their fantastically complex musculature and sensory organs; they are more akin to something like white blood cells in a human body. They are dependent on the radiation and EM fields of Rorschach for basic biological functions and seem to completely lack consciousness. The crew explore questions of identity, the nature, utility and interdependence of intelligence and consciousness. They theorize that humanity could be an unusual offshoot of evolution, wasting bodily and economic resources on the self-aware ego which has little value in terms of Darwinian fitness. Open warfare breaks out between the humans and the Scramblers and Theseus eventually decides to sacrifice itself and its crew using its antimatter payload to eliminate Rorschach. One crew member, the protagonist and narrator Siri Keeton, is shot off inside an escape vessel in a decades-long fall back to Earth to relay the crucial information amassed back to humanity. As he travels back towards the inner Solar System, he hears radio broadcasts which suggest that the vampires have revolted and may be exterminating baseline humanity. Characters=Crew of the Theseus *Siri Keeton is the narrator and protagonist. Debilitating brain surgery for medical purposes has cut him off from his own emotional life and made him a talented \\"synthesist\\", adept at reading others' intentions impartially with the aid of cybernetics. He is assigned to Theseus to interpret the actions of the specialized crew and report these activities to Mission Control on Earth. He comes to realize that the other crew members resent him for his role, seeing him as nosy surveillance. *Major Amanda Bates is a combat specialist, controlling an army of robotic \\"grunts\\". *Isaac Szpindel is the ship's primary biologist and physician. He is in love with Michelle, one of the Gang's personalities. *Jukka Sarasti is a vampire and the crew's nominal (and frightening) leader. As a predator from the Pleistocene, he is alleged to be far smarter than baseline humans. The novel's conclusion questions to what extent Sarasti has actually led the crew. *The Gang are four distinct personalities in the mind of one woman, the ship's linguist. They are tasked with communicating with the aliens, if possible. A single personality \\"surfaces\\" to take control of their body at any given time. The active personality reveals itself through a change in tone and posture. These personalities express offence when referred to as \\"alters\\". The personalities are: **Susan James, whom the others refer to as \\"Mom\\". She is the \\"original\\" personality. **Michelle is a shy, quiet, synaesthetic woman who is romantically involved with Szpindel. **Sascha is harsher and more overtly hostile towards Siri. **Cruncher, a male, rarely surfaces and serves as an advanced data-processing facility for James. *Robert Cunningham, Szpindel's backup, is a secondary biologist/physician. *The Captain is the ship's artificial intelligence. Throughout the story, the Captain remains inscrutable and mysterious, generally communicating directly only with Sarasti. People on Earth *Robert Paglino, Siri's childhood best friend. *Chelsea, Siri's ex-girlfriend. A professional tweaker of human personalities. *Helen Keeton, Siri's mother, whose consciousness has been connected, brain in a vat style, to a virtual utopia called \\"Heaven\\". As a parent, she traumatized Siri with emotional demands and intrusiveness into his private life. *Jim Moore is Siri's father, a colonel involved with planetary defense. Aliens *Rorschach, an alien vessel or organism in low orbit around the sub-brown dwarf Big Ben. While it has a superhuman intelligence, it gradually becomes apparent that Rorschach completely lacks true consciousness or self-awareness. *Scramblers, 9-legged anaerobic aliens that inhabit Rorschach and appear to be part of it in some sense. Like Rorschach, they are more intelligent than humans but not conscious or self-aware. Major themes=Consciousness The exploration of consciousness is the central thematic element of Blindsight. The title of the novel refers to the condition blindsight, in which vision is non-functional in the conscious brain but remains useful to non-conscious action. Other conditions, such as Cotard delusion and Anton–Babinski syndrome, are used to illustrate differences from the usual assumptions about conscious experience. The novel raises questions about the essential character of consciousness. Is the interior experience of consciousness necessary, or is externally observed behavior the sole determining characteristic of conscious experience? Is an interior emotional experience necessary for empathy, or is empathic behavior sufficient to possess empathy? Relevant to these questions is a plot element near the climax of the story, in which the vampire captain is revealed to have been controlled by the ship's artificial intelligence for the entirety of the novel. Philosopher John Searle's Chinese room thought experiment is used as a metaphor to illustrate the tension between the notions of consciousness as an interior experience of understanding, as contrasted with consciousness as the emergent result of merely functional non-introspective components. Blindsight contributes to this debate by implying that some aspects of consciousness are empirically detectable. Specifically, the novel supposes that consciousness is necessary for both aesthetic appreciation and for effective communication. However, the possibility is raised that consciousness is, for humanity, an evolutionary dead end. That is, consciousness may have been naturally selected as a solution for the challenges of a specific place in space and time, but will become a limitation as conditions change or competing intelligences are encountered. The alien creatures encountered by the crew of the Theseus themselves lack consciousness. The necessity of consciousness for effective communication is illustrated by a passage from the novel in which the linguist realizes that the alien creatures can't be, in fact, conscious because of their lack of semantic understanding: > \\"Tell me more about your cousins,\\" Rorschach sent. > \\"Our cousins lie about the family tree,\\" Sascha replied, \\"with nieces and > nephews and Neanderthals. We do not like annoying cousins.\\" > \\"We'd like to know about this tree.\\" > Sascha muted the channel and gave us a look that said Could it be any more > obvious? \\"It couldn't have parsed that. There were three linguistic > ambiguities in there. It just ignored them.\\" > \\"Well, it asked for clarification,\\" Bates pointed out. > \\"It asked a follow-up question. Different thing entirely.\\" The notion that these aliens could lack consciousness and possess intelligence is linked to the idea that some humans could also have diminished consciousness and remain outwardly functional. This idea is similar to the concept of philosophical zombie, as it is understood in philosophy of mind. Blindsight supposes that sociopaths might be a manifestation of this same phenomenon, and the demands of corporate environments might be environmental factors causing some part of humanity to evolve toward becoming philosophical zombies. Transhumanism Blindsight also explores the implications of a transhuman future. Within the novel, humans no longer engage in sex with other humans for pleasure, instead choosing to use virtual reality to find idealized and submissive partners, and many choose to withdraw from reality entirely by living in constructed virtual worlds, referred to as \\"Heaven\\". Vampires are predators from humanity's distant past, resurrected through recovered DNA, and live among the humans of the late 21st century. These vampires operate with diminished sentience presented as comparable to high-functional autism with comparable dysfunction in affect and speech, but have the advantage of multiple simultaneous thoughts occurring in parallel within their minds. Enhanced pattern-matching skills comparable to some forms of autism combine with this \\"hyperthreading\\" to make them invaluable in developing unusual and often very effective approaches to solving complex problems. Reception Carl Hayes, in his review for Booklist, wrote: \\"Watts packs in enough tantalizing ideas for a score of novels while spinning new twists on every cutting-edge motif from virtual reality to extraterrestrial biology.\\" Kirkus Reviews said about the book: \\"Watts carries several complications too many, but presents nonetheless a searching, disconcerting, challenging, sometimes piercing inquisition.\\" Jackie Cassida in her review for Library Journal wrote: \\"Watts continues to challenge readers with his imaginative plots and superb storytelling.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote: \\"Watts puts a terrifying and original spin on the familiar alien contact story.\\" Elizabeth Bear, an award-winning author in the science fiction field, declared: > It's my opinion that Peter Watts's Blindsight is the best hard science > fiction novel of the first decade of this millennium – and I say that as > someone who remains unconvinced of all the ramifications of its central > argument.

(1997) Critical Criminology: Visions from Europe, London: SAGE pg.79 Ian Taylor, Jock Young and Paul Walton wrote the groundbreaking The New Criminology in 1973, following that with the edited collection, Critical Criminology, in 1975 writing on the need for a marxist, \\"fully social\\" theory of deviance. Whereas those around Stuart Hall, at the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies focussed on \\"sub-cultures of imagination and resistance\\".

New blood mixed with the old, and speeches from scholars such as Robert Reiner, Steve Hall, Keith Hayward, Simon Hallsworth, Paul Hamilton, Phil Hodgeson John Lea, Mike Sutton, Simon Winlow, Andrew Wilson, Kevin Stenson and Mark Horsley called for new theories to analyse crime and control in today's world. The conference was organized by Simon Winlow and Rowland Atkinson. The National Deviancy Conference was held again at Teesside University in 2014. The theme was 'critical criminology and post-crash capitalism'. It was organized by the Teesside Centre for Realist Criminology.

The Krummlauf (English: \\"curved barrel\\") is a bent barrel attachment for the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle developed by Germany in World War II. The curved barrel included a periscope sighting device for shooting around corners from a safe position. Description It was produced in several variants: an \\"I\\" version for infantry use, a \\"P\\" version for use in tanks (to cover the dead areas in the close range around the tank, to defend against assaulting infantry), versions with 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° bends, a version for the StG 44 and one for the MG 42. Only the 30° \\"I\\" version for the StG 44 was produced in many numbers. The bent barrel attachments had very short lifespans – approx. 300 rounds for the 30° version, and 160 rounds for the 45° variant–as the barrel and bullets fired were put under great stress. Another problem besides the short life-span was that the bending caused the bullets to shatter and exit the barrel in multiple fragments, producing an unintended shotgun effect. As a result, weapons designers experimented with small vent holes drilled into the Krummlauf's barrel in order to reduce pressure and recoil, allowing the discharged bullets' built-up gases to be released to slow the bullet's velocity as it turned to exit the barrel. Nevertheless, the Krummlauf's lifespan remained the same. A triangular shield was also added to prevent venting gasses from clouding the mirror/optics. The 30° model was able to achieve a 35x35 cm grouping at 100m. One of the biggest drawbacks of the small number (91 conversions) of Panzerjäger Tiger (P) casemate-type tank destroyers was that in spite of having an 88mm anti tank gun, the initial Ferdinand version of the Elefant did not have a forward-facing hull mount machine gun to handle enemy infantry. Hence, the Krummlauf was fitted with the StG44 Gun and used by the tank crew as a machine gun. Derivatives Experiments to adapt the Krummlauf to the PPSh-41 were conducted by the Soviet Union.http://www.ppsh41.com/serge3.htm See also * CornerShot * Periscope rifle ReferencesExternal links * http://www.lexikon-der- wehrmacht.de/Waffen/Bilderseitenneu/Krummlauf.htm Category:Research and development in Nazi Germany Category:World War II infantry weapons of Germany ","title":"Krummlauf"},{"id":"12691083","text":"Saptagram (colloquially called Satgaon) was a major port, the chief city and sometimes capital of southern Bengal, in ancient and medieval times, the location presently being in the Hooghly district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is about 4 km from Bandel, a major rail junction. By the early twentieth century, the place had dwindled to a group of insignificant huts.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, p. 2, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. The port had to be abandoned because of the silting up and consequent drying of the Saraswati River. It influenced the subsequent development and growth of Kolkata. H. E. A. Cotton writes, \\"Here then may be traced nucleus of the future city of Calcutta, and as time went on the silting up of the river opposite Satgaon still further favoured her fortunes.\\" Etymology The word Saptagram means seven villages. These are identified as Bansberia, Kristapur, Basudebpur, Nityanandapur, Sibpur, Sambachora and Baladghati. There is a mythological story attached to the name. King Priyabanta of Kannauj had seven sons – Agnitra, Medhatithi, Bapusman, Jyotisman, Dutisman, Saban and Bhabya. They were not happy with the royal life and so they set out in search of a place where they could carry out their meditation. When they came to the confluence of the Ganges, Jamuna and Saraswati, they liked the place and settled down in seven villages to a hermit's life. Thus grew Saptagram around the seven villages. Geography The Saraswati River used to take off from Hooghly River at Tribeni, 50 km north of Kolkata, ran parallel to the Hooghly River on its west. Saraswati started drying up from the 17th century and ships, which navigated up the river, could no longer do so. Around the time when Bakhtiyar Khilji (1204–1206) came to Bengal, the region was divided into five parts – Rarh, Bagri, Vanga, Barendra and Mithila. Vanga was further subdivided into three parts – Lakhanabati, Subarnagram and Saptagram. When the frontiers of Bengal were expanded during Mughal rule, there were three prominent administrative zones in the area – Sirkar Satgaon, Sirkar Selimabad and Sirkar Mandaran. History According to Binoy Ghosh, Tamralipta, the ancient port, started declining from the 8th century, owing to river silting, and Saptagram possibly started gaining in importance as a port from the 9-10th century. Saptagram port, along with its business centre, had become important in the pre-Muslim era, during the rule of the Palas and Senas. In the Muslim era, Saptagram was an important administrative centre right from the beginning, and the period 14th to 16th century was considered the golden age of Saptagram. In the 17th century, Hooghly-Bandel-Chinsurah started gaining in importance. From the 18th century, Kolkata started emerging as the main business and cultural centre of Bengal.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 312-316 , Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. These are some of the highlights of Saptagrm: *During the rule of Muhammad bin Tughluq, in 1328, the three important administrative centres of Bengal were Satgaon, Lakhanabati and Sonargaon. *Ibn Battuta, the Moroccan scholar, landed at Satgaon port in 1345-46. *Chaitanya Bhagavata has a decription of Saptagram in 1530-40. *From 1537-38 onwards Satgon finds a mention in Portuguese descriptions. *There is a description of Saptagram, during 1574-1604, in Chandimangalkavya of Mukundaram. Sayed Jamaluddin Mosque in Saptagram Earliest record suggests that the Muslim ruler Bahram Khan was first appointed the governor of Saptagram during 1324–1328 by Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq.Bandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, Banglar Itihas (History of Bengal), 1971, , p. 8, Naba Bharat Publishers, 72 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata. He had built a mosque at Saptagram collecting materials from many Hindu and Buddhist temples, thereby indicating the prosperity of Saptagram in the earlier Hindu and Buddhist periods.Bandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, pp. 66–67 It is the oldest mosque in Bengal. There is another mosque named Sayed Jamaluddin Mosque which was built with terracotta ornamentation. When Bahram Khan was transferred to Sonargaon, Izzuddin Yahya was made the next governor of Saptagram in 1328. After his death in 1338, his deputy Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah took control and declared independence from Delhi. Ilyas Shah annexed Lakhnauti in 1342 and Sonargaon in 1352 to his kingdom. Thus Saptagram became a part of whole unified Bengal for the first time in history. Portuguese settlement The Portuguese called Saptagram Porto Pequeno (Little Haven); on the contrary Chittagong was Porto Grande (Great Haven). In 1533, the Portuguese Afonso de Melo arrived with five ships and a hundred men. They presented lavish gifts to the Sultan. However, instead of being pleased the Sultan put the Portuguese behind bars, because the gifts were stolen materials. A conflict situation arose. Messages were sent to the Portuguese governor at Goa. Chittagong port was set on fire. Diano Rebelo arrived at Saptagram with a force. Many thought that Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah would give a big fight. He did not. He released the Portuguese prisoners and granted them permission to trade at Chittagong and Saptagram. He had his own reasons; he wanted the support of the Portuguese in the internal struggle that was just unfolding and also feared the attack by the Afghan Sur emperor, Sher Shah Suri. By 1535, the Portuguese were well settled in Saptagram. When Sher Shah Suri attacked Saptagram, the Portuguese fought for the Sultan, but they withdrew their forces in 1538. The same year Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah was defeated. It was only after Sher Shah Suri's death and the decline of Afghan supremacy that the Portuguese returned to Saptagram by around 1550. Travelers account Traveler Ibn Battuta visited Satgaon in 1350.Bandopadhyay, Rakhaldas, p. 81 From various records it is noted that local traders did not go abroad for trading but Arab, Persian and Turkish traders came to Saptagram for the purpose. The Portuguese started coming to Saptagram from the early 16th century. Caesar Frederick, a Venetian who had travelled in the East from 1563 to 1581 and has left behind an account about some important cities, ports and business centres of India and of Bengal, mentions thirty to thirty five ships loaded with goods at Saptagram. Tomé Pires, a Portuguese traveller, did not visit Bengal but his work Suma Oriental written during 1512–1515 in India and Malacca gave an account of contemporary Bengal. He wrote, \\"It is a good city and rich where there are many merchants. It must have ten thousand inhabitants.\\" Ralph Fitch, an English traveller and trader, mentioned \\"Satgaon is a fairy city of the Moors, and very plentiful of all things.\\" In 1591, he thrilled London with the magnificent possibilities of Eastern commerce. Decline The silting of the river was taking its toll. Adi Ganga or present Tolly's Nullah was the outlet to the sea. The river was easily navigable for ocean-going ships up to Adi Ganga, beyond that only country boats operated. Betore on the western bank of the river had come up as a roaring trading centre. Many traders had started shifting to Hooghly. Gobindasharan Datta Chowdhury (also Raja Gobindasharan Dutta) made his way to the eastern bank of the river from Andul, and set up the village of Gobindapur, from 'Bada Rusa'. It was much later that Job Charnock came and landed at Sutanuti. As the curtain wrung down over Saptagram, Kolkata started unfolding as a major metropolis. Now, it is an all quiet riverside, partly urbanised with an occasional factory chimney belching smoke in the distance. The Ishwar Gupta Setu, opened in 1989, linking Bandel with Kalyani offers a view of the Hooghly River.

The islands are: Offer Wadham Islands (the most northernly and easterly), Copper Island, Duck Island, White Island, Peckford Island (the largest), Coleman Island, Small Island.Roland Abbott, A Brief History of the Offer Wadham Island: the Million Dollar Rock, 1994 History The Wadham Islands were extremely popular fishing grounds since the early 19th century and were first used by crews from Bonavista. Mostly the Offer Wadhams and Peckford islands were used, as they had ideal drying conditions and some of the best salt cod in the country. Many families who fished off these islands decided to settle in nearby Doting Cove and fish off the Wadham Islands in the summer. Such families were the Cuffs, Hickses and Moulands in the 1850s. For more than 100 years Doting Cove men moved to the Wadham Islands in the summer to fish. In 1858, the Offer Wadham Lighthouse was erected on the Offer Wadham islands, the first lighthouse on the northern part of Bonavista Bay. After the lighthouse was constructed, there was a small year-round population of lightkeepers and their families. In 1899, there were post offices established at Peckford's Island and Offer Wadhams. They also had schools, a Methodist church and mercantile premises.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador Church history A Methodist church was erected on the Wadham Islands in the late 19th century. The residents had to collect money in order to buy a Bible for the church. An inscription on the Bible reads: \\"Wadham Island Methodist Church July 1899. Bought by subscription collected by Mrs. Charles H. Prowse\\". Church services were held nearly every Sunday in the summer and were conducted by residents on the island.

Personal life Neagle worked as a truck driver and was the father of former Essendon player Jay Neagle, who was drafted under the father-son rule at the end of the 2005 AFL season. Death Neagle died when the trailer of the B-double truck he was driving flipped over and crushed the cabin at Tharbogang, near Griffith, New South Wales. Neagle's death at 54 years of age prompted a flow of tributes from former teammates and associates. Coach Kevin Sheedy recalled that Neagle: > ...was not only a brilliant footballer but was also a real character. Merv > was a very tenacious, hard-running player and his courage and toughness were > typical of Essendon teams of that era. He had great physicality for a > wingman and was a terrific kick for goal on the run. He also gave a lot back > to country football after he retired, and along with Tim Watson was one of > the finest players to come out of Dimboola. Merv has left us all too soon > but has left those who knew him with many great memories.

He lives in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he runs the website and is a spokesperson for the Army of God, an anti-abortion Christian terrorist organization that has been identified as an active underground terrorist organization by Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security's joint Terrorism Knowledge Base. Biography Spitz is a first-generation Italian American whose family immigrated from Sant'Elia Fiumerapido, Italy and settled in Paterson, New Jersey. Spitz was born in Norfolk, Virginia, into a military family. He joined the Navy at 18 and served for two years during the Vietnam War. In the early 1980s Spitz moved to New York City, where he ran a street evangelism ministry in Times Square. Spitz was ordained in Manhattan by evangelist Leander Bolhoarst into the Pentacostal International Gospel Crusade. In 1993, Spitz moved to Chesapeake, Virginia where he formed Operation Rescue ChesapeakeExtremist groups: information for students, Volume 1 – Thomson/Gale, 2006 then Pro-Life Virginia. He currently operates the Army of God website. Activity Spitz was \\"best friends\\" with Christian terrorist Paul Jennings Hill until Hill, who murdered physician John Britton and retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel (and Britton's bodyguard) James Barrett, was executed. Spitz was Hill's spiritual adviser during the last week of his life and was with Hill when he was executed. Spitz was one of the 29 signers of the Defensive Action Statement, which he posted on the Army of God's website. The Defensive Action Statement argued that the murders Hill committed were justified to protect \\"unborn children\\". Spitz was ordered to appear before two separate grand juries. The grand juries were held in Alexandria, Virginia and in Philadelphia during separate investigations into Hill and Clayton Waagner, a man who sent hundreds of anthrax scare letters to abortion providers in 2001. After John Salvi attacked two reproductive health clinics in Massachusetts, he drove to Norfolk Virginia where Spitz lived at the time. It was reported by the Boston Globe, at the time of his arrest in Norfolk, Salvi had Spitz's name and unlisted phone number in his possession. Spitz held a prayer vigil outside Salvi's jail cell. Spitz was so outspoken in defense of Salvi, he was asked not to come to Massachusetts for Salvi’s trial and he would be unwelcome if he did.scanned letter located at http://www.armyofgod.com/JohnSalviMassachusetts.html Women: images and realities : a multicultural anthology – Amy Vita Kesselman, Lily D. McNair, Nancy Schniedewind – McGraw-Hill, Nov 2, 2006 Spitz was ejected from Operation Rescue. He formed Operation Rescue Chesapeake, but after a year and a half, when Flip Benham took control of the national organization, Spitz was ordered to separate himself and his organization from the Operation Rescue name because of his support and friendship with Hill. Spitz changed the name of his organization from Operation Rescue Chesapeake to Pro-Life Virginia. Spitz gained attention in 2001 with his support for Waagner, who was one of the FBI's ten most wanted, who sent hundreds of anthrax letters to abortion clinics throughout the United States. Spitz was also suspected of harboring Waagner and receiving phone calls from him while Waagner was on the lam. In response to the 1998 shooting death of Barnett Slepian, Spitz said: \\"What would I say to the family of Slepian? They live in a $500,000 house that was paid for with blood money – the blood of those babies that Barnett Slepian murdered... He knew what he was doing, he was murdering children.

Often, the terms international psychology, global psychology, transnational psychology, and cross-cultural psychology are used interchangeably, but their purposes are subtly and importantly different: Global means worldwide, international means across and between nations, transnational means to transcend the nation-state, cross-cultural means across cultures. In contrast, the term “multicultural” is more often used to refer to ethnic and other cultural differences existing within a given nation rather than to global or international comparisons.  Definitions and scope International psychology is concerned with the emergence and practice of psychology in different parts of the world (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). It advocates committed involvement in worldwide and regional psychology and policy-making organizations such as the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS includes 87 national psychology associations and more than 20 international/regional associations), the International Association of Applied Psychology (IAAP), the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), the International Council of Psychologists (ICP), the European Federation of Psychologists’ Associations (EFPA: it includes 36 national psychology associations), the Sociedad Interamericana de Psicología (SIP), the recently founded Pan-African Psychological Union (PAPU), and others. In addition, there exist more than 100 international psychology organizations each focusing on a specific subdiscipline. The goal is to establish psychology as a global discipline that in its theories, research practices, applications, and ethical aspirations is focused on the psychological study of humanity as a whole while avoiding as much as possible ethnocentric biases and preoccupations (McCormick & Constantable, 2015; Stevens & Wedding, 2004). For an annotated bibliography on international psychology that covers 156 publications, see Takooshian, Gielen, Rich, and Velayo (2016). In contrast, the term global psychology is more frequently used to refer to the worldwide investigation of global issues and phenomena from a psychological and psychocultural point of view. Examples include the investigation of subjective well being, identification and treatment of mental health problems, the psychological dimensions of family systems, gender roles and gender-typed behavior, childrearing practices, cognitive and emotional functioning, international attitudes, value systems, intergroup conflicts, threats to the natural environment, societal transformation and national development, the struggles of disempowered groups (such as women, children, immigrants, and refugees) as seen in a global perspective (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). Cross- cultural psychology may be defined as the relativistic study of behavior and mental processes in different cultures, whereas cultural psychology takes a comparative approach. Cross-cultural psychology aims to compare the psychological phenomena between cultures and looks for patterns, generalizability, and culture-specific differentiation (Lonner, 2018; Shiraev & Levy, 2013). An example would be the investigation of child-rearing practices and their psychological consequences between distinctly different groups. Cultural psychology focuses on the relationship between psychology and culture (such as language, traditions, predominant values, and socialization practices) within a culture and how it affects individual human functioning. Both cultural and cross-cultural psychology constitute important elements of global psychology. Cross-cultural psychology emerged during the 1960s-1970s as a separate field of study with a definite identity; it is thus older than the more general field of international psychology, which is only now emerging as a distinct discipline. The Oxford English Dictionary (1993) defines global as, “…pertaining to or involving the world, worldwide” (p. 1101) and international as, “Existing, occurring, or carried on between nations…Agreed on by many nations; used by, or able to be used by (the people of) many nations” (p. 1397). At present the term international psychology is in wider use although Stevens and Gielen (2007) prefer the term global psychology, to underline the increasingly global nature of psychological phenomena and problems together with their scientific investigation and efforts to ameliorate them. More generally, the emergence and intensification of an international psychology movement is part and parcel of the broader process of globalization in the scientific, economic, technological, sociocultural, political and ecological spheres. It reflects and makes use of the increasingly global flow of information, ideas, and peoples. In addition, globalization in psychology has led to the de facto use of English as the predominant means of communication so that academics in many parts of the world are now expected to read and publish in English-language journals. Kurtis, Adams, Grabe, and Else-Quest have proposed a transnational psychology in order to counter the Western bias in the field of psychology. Transnational psychology applies transnational feminist lenses, developed through interdisciplinary work in postcolonial and feminist studies, to the field of psychology to study, understand, and address the impact of colonization, imperialism, and globalization. This approach uses a context-sensitive cultural psychology lens to reconsider, de-naturalize, and de-universalize psychological science. Kurtis and Adams suggested that people in the non-Western, \\"Majority World\\" (areas where the majority of the world's population lives), should be viewed as resources for revising traditional psychological science. In addition, Bhatia believes that a transnational cultural psychology is needed examine the psychology of diasporas, who are impacted by globalization and consequently have many “homes,” languages, and selves. It should be added that international psychology, global psychology, and cross-cultural psychology share the common goal of making psychology more universal and less ethnocentric in character, whereas transnational psychology is concerned with uncovering the particularities of the psychology of groups without regard to nation-state boundaries and is opposed to universalization. Because American psychologists dominated the field of psychology especially in the decades after World War II, they frequently ignored contributions from other parts of the world and claimed, whether explicitly or implicitly, that their theories, concepts, ethical standards, and empirical findings applied to all—or at least most—people around the world. In addition, because they largely ignored books and journals not written in English, American psychology became a largely monocultural and monolinguistic discipline (Draguns, 2001). Consequently, it is a key goal of internationally oriented psychologists both in the US and elsewhere to turn psychology into a more universally and less culturally biased discipline that contributes to human welfare everywhere while strengthening \\"world consciouness\\" rather than ethnocentric and potentially violent forms of nationalism or extremist religious preoccupations (Leong, Pickren, Leach, & Marsella, 2012). Practical advice about how best to internationalize the teaching of psychology can be found in the handbooks of Rich, Gielen, and Takooshian (2017) and Keith (2018).  Foci  Major foci of international psychology include: * The worldwide study of psychological processes and phenomena (e.g., Gielen, 2016; Hofstede, 2001). * Macro-level interventions and policy making, for example, international efforts to reduce HIV infections based on psychological research (Wessells & Dawes, 2007), to assess and reduce ethnic conflicts (Landis & Albert, 2013), and to further global mental health (Patel, Minas, Cohen, & Prince, 2014). * Micro-level interventions, for example, counseling and psychotherapy, school psychology, and interventions in organizations (e.g., Aycan, Kanungo, & Mendonça, 2014; Moodley, Gielen, & Wu, 2013; Pedersen, Lonner, Draguns, & Trimble, 2015). * International networking and international psychology organizations and conferences, such as IUPsyS, IAAP, IACCP, EFPA, SIP, APA’s Division 52 – International Psychology, APA's Office of International Affairs, and the Institute for International and Cross-Cultural Psychology (IICCP) (Merenda, 1995). * Supporting efforts to internationalize psychology education by infusing global, international, and cultural perspectives into the curriculum, providing international and cross-cultural training experiences, increasing international faculty and student exchange, and forming collaborative research programs (Heine, 2016; Leong et al., 2012; McCarthy, Dickson, Cranney, Trapp, & Karandashev, 2012; Rich & Gielen, 2015; Rich, Gielen, & Takooshian, 2017; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, & Velayo, 2016). * Rewriting the history of psychology from a global and less ethnocentric point of view, together with corresponding changes in the curriculum (Baker, 2012; Brock, 2007; Leong et al., 2012; Rich & Gielen, 2015; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, & Velayo, 2016). * Establishing shared training standards, professional regulations, and codes of ethics (Pettifor, 2007; Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, & Korkut, 2012), such as the Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists (2008), which has been adopted by the IUPsyS and its 87 national member organizations (Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, & Korkut, 2012). * Representing psychology at the United Nations especially in the context of non-governmental organizations (NGO's). An important step in this regard was taken in 2012, when The Psychology of NGOs Accredited at the United Nations (PCUN) was established by a group of psychology-based NGOs. These NGOs advocate for the inclusion of psychological perspectives, research, and practice, for instance when formulating and implementing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. *Based in part on the advocacy of psychologists such as Judy Kuriansky, Chair of the Psychology Coalition of NGOs at the United Nations, mental health and well-being have for the first time been included in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Supported by the World Bank Group and the World Health Organization (2016), mental health specialists are now succeeding in moving mental health issues from the periphery closer to the center of worldwide efforts to improve global health. History Modern scientific psychology had an international dimension from its beginnings in the late 19th century. Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), for instance, the father of modern experimental psychology, supervised approximately 190 doctoral students from at least 10 countries. Similarly, the First International Congress of Physiological Psychology in 1889, in Paris, included more than 200 participants from 20 countries (Sabourin & Cooper, 2014). Although psychology developed first in Europe, it soon began to prosper in the United States as well. Altogether, modern scientific psychology remained a predominantly western enterprise till well after World War II although modern psychology was already present in the early 1900s in some nonwestern countries such as India, Japan, and Mexico. During the 1930s many prominent psychologists from Germany and Austria emigrated to the United States. As a result of these developments, psychology in the United States assumed worldwide leadership, but also grew increasingly monocultural, monolingual, and ethnocentric in character (see David and Buchanan, 2003, and Bullock, 2012, for timelines of important events in the history of international psychology). However, there is now an increased awareness among U.S. psychologists that U.S. psychology must take into account global developments in order to fully represent the world of psychology. For instance, the American Psychological Association established in 1997 an International Psychology Division (Division 52), which currently has about 600 members. During the last three to four decades, especially, psychology has expanded worldwide and assumed a global presence. Stevens and Gielen (2007) and some others have estimated that there are over one million psychologists. This estimate is based on local definitions of what it means to be a professional psychologist: in most countries the prerequisite is a Master's degree or Diploma in psychology, whereas in others (e.g., Brazil) a professionally oriented Bachelor’s degree that incorporates a period of supervised practice enables one to gain admission to a licensing examination. The global estimate includes well over 320,000 psychologists in Europe, at least 250,000 in Latin America, and 225,000 in the United States. The country with the highest density of psychologists is Argentina. In addition, psychology has gained ground in East and Southeast Asia and is increasingly visible in Muslim countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Iran, and Lebanon (Ahmed & Gielen, 1998; Baker, 2012; Stevens & Wedding, 2004). In sub-Saharan Africa, psychology is well developed in South Africa, but less present though expanding in the other regions. For more detailed information, see the edited volume by Stevens and Wedding (2004) which includes analyses of the status of psychology in 27 countries located on all inhabited continents. The handbook by Baker (2012) reviews the respective histories of psychology in 27 countries and regions around the world while the volume by Rich and Gielen (2015) focuses on 17 past and present pathfinders in the realm of international psychology. The contributions respectively to Moodley, Gielen, and Wu (2013) and Gerstein et al. (2009) analyze the status of counseling psychology and psychotherapy in numerous countries. In general, psychology as a discipline has prospered in well-to-do, urbanized, and individualistic countries and cultures but it is frequently considered an unnecessary luxury in the poorer and more rural regions of the world where the treatment of physical health problems by modern healthcare workers and indigenous healers is likely to take precedence over the identification and treatment of mental health problems (Leung & Zhang, 1995; O'Gorman, Shum, Halford, & Ogilvie, 2012). Such problems are frequently treated by indigenous healers who tend to rely on supernatural explanations for their identification and treatment. However, a global mental health movement that has been strongly influenced by psychiatrists is gathering steam. This makes it likely that in the future, greater resources will be allocated to mental health problems especially in medium-income countries (Patel et al., 2014). Countries where psychology is both influential and especially well developed include The Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Germany, USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Austria, the Scandinavian countries, and Argentina (especially psychoanalysis).  Trends  Perhaps the best measure of trends within international psychology is within its organizations, through new membership, conference topics, and cooperative research across borders. For example, the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) has seen an increase of new member countries from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America in the past 15 years; membership in such organizations represents a desire and need in these countries for networking, training, accreditation, expansion of scientific research, and international recognition (Stevens & Gielen, 2007). Correspondingly, international psychology conferences are now increasingly taking place in both Western and non-Western countries. IUPSyS's quadrennial International Congresses of Psychology (ICP), for instance, have been and will be taking place in Beijing (2004), Berlin (2008), Cape Town (2012), Yokohama (2016), and Prague (2020). Similarly, the quadrennial Congresses of Applied Psychology offered by IAAP, the largest international psychology organization for individual members, have taken or will take place around the globe in cities such as San Francisco (1998), Singapore (2002), Athens (2006), Melbourne (2010), Paris (2014), and Montreal (2018). Trends in global psychology point to the sustained growth, specialization, and feminization of psychology, and the emergence of contextually sensitive paradigms. The number of psychologists, psychology students, and psychology programs worldwide continues to grow steadily, proving that one of the goals of globalization is being met. However, much work still needs to be done to bring psychology to underdeveloped areas, and to increase the resources and development of the field in countries where it has already taken hold (Adair & Kağitçibaşi, 1995; Stevens & Wedding, 2004). Specialization is a growing trend, with each nation focusing specializations on its own needs and goals. Also, communication within these specializations is being facilitated through the World Wide Web and the emergence and growth of specialized international organizations and journals in subfields of psychology. Although access to the Internet is frequently still limited in low-income countries, it has nevertheless improved considerably in recent years thus facilitating the exchange of scientific and professional information as well as research data. The Journal of Cross- Cultural Psychology, for instance, is increasingly publishing papers by large teams of international psychologists that compare psychological phenomena across numerous countries located on all inhabited continents. Moreover, high impact psychological journals published in North America and Europe have broadened their scope by increasingly accepting articles by international and non-Western authors including those residing in East Asian countries. Feminization in psychology is another trend, as women are beginning to dominate the field in Europe, Latin America, Canada, the United States, and parts of Asia. A trend within this trend is the continued dominance of male psychologists within business and academia, whereas women tend to work more frequently in school, counseling, and clinical settings. Finally, with the globalization of psychology comes the demand for more culturally sensitive paradigms (Heine, 2016). Traditionally, psychology was taught in the Western context, reflecting the norms, values, and data of those particular regions. Increasing awareness that this psychology does not sufficiently address culturally specific as well as global issues and therefore does not fully apply to some cultures has led to the call for indigenous psychologies, or at least an alternative psychology to the mainstream, reductionistic paradigm which may be applied to most, if not all, cultures (Kim, Yang, & Hwang, 2006). Prominent centers of indigenous psychology include Mexico, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan. Moreover, the increasing inclusion of globally collected data of psychological relevance is gradually undermining the traditionally ethnocentric nature of psychology as taught in the United States and elsewhere in the West (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). Theoretically, indigenous psychologists emphasizing culturally sensitive paradigms tend to see themselves as cultural rather than as cross-cultural psychologists. Moreover, global psychology profits from an emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation with experts from fields such as cultural and psychological anthropology, sociology, behavioral economics, and political science. This holds true because behavior patterns are generally influenced by a broad array of forces that may vary from society to society.  Professional regulations and ethical standards  Many countries around the world have professional regulations for the practice of psychology. “With some exceptions, the existence of professional regulation reflects the level of development of professional psychology in that country. A profession needs to establish an identity and credibility before there is something to be regulated” (Pettifor, 2007, p. 312). In the 36 European countries represented in EFPA, a major effort is underway to unify the basic academic curriculum as well as other requirements underlying the training and certification of psychologists. These countries have established specific yet wide-ranging guidelines for a European Diploma in Psychology comparable to a Master’s level university education of six years duration that includes supervised practice. The diploma will enable psychologists trained in one country to practice in other European countries and is likely to influence the education and practice of psychologists in other parts of the world as well. Countries that currently have limited or no regulation of the profession include India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Thailand and Turkey. Several of these countries are working toward licensing legislation, and several have developed ethical standards of practice to guide. Many national psychology associations have adopted a code of ethics such as, for instance, APA’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. EFPA has adopted several codes of ethics in recent years, and the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) adopted a unified code of ethics in 1988, which they revised in 1998 to be more consistent with EFPA’s meta-code (Pettifor, 2007). Moreover, IUPsyS and IAAP adopted, in 2008, a Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists. Such codes and declarations tend to be aspirational in nature.  Conclusion  The scope of scientific psychology and its practice have expanded enormously from its early beginnings in the 19th century to today. This holds true for all post- industrial countries and increasingly for some modernizing nations such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Turkey. In contrast, psychology remains much less visible in the poorer countries and especially so in their rural areas. The expansion of psychology into the nonwestern world has led to an increasing awareness of the role of cultural factors in psychological functioning together with repeated calls to “indigenize” psychology (Kim, Yang, & Hwang, 2006). International contacts among psychologists as well as joint research and applied projects across national and geographic boundaries have prospered thanks to the rapidly evolving technologies of transportation and electronic communication. Consequently, one may safely predict that the cross-cultural, global, and international dimensions of psychology will become more prominent in the foreseeable future.

Coconuts, earthenware, sandalwood, cloth, lime, rice, spices, salt, cloves, pumpkins, silk sarees, betel leaves, betel nuts, elephants, and precious and semi-precious stones were the main items of trade. Sometimes, even women were allowed to navigate as Sadhabas. Odia navigators were instrumental in spreading Buddhism and Hinduism in East and Southeast Asia. In addition, they disseminated knowledge of Indian architecture, epics such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Indic writing and Sanskrit loan words in many Southeast Asian languages such as Khmer, Indonesian, and Tagalog. Maritime trade declined only in the 16th century, with the decline of the Gajapati dynasty.

Llanharan RFC was formally established in 1891-92 when Llanharan was little more than an agricultural hamlet. The earliest photograph on the clubhouse wall is dated 1898. Llanharan RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues. Early history In its early years, the club used local inns such as the High Corner and Turberville as a base. The club applied for Welsh Rugby Union membership in 1919 along with Pontyclun and Taffs Well. All three clubs were awarded membership on 22 August that year, but were told to \\"put your grounds in order\\".Hard Kicks but Good Touches - A Celebration of 100 years of Rugby at Pontyclun R.F.C. 1887-1987, John David (1987) pg28 In 1948 the first purpose built headquarters/changing rooms were transported from RAF Llandow airfield. A clubhouse was built in 1962 on the site of the old British Restaurant. The original building was a wartime hut, transported piece by piece from the RAF Stormy Down camp and progressively enlarged into three bars and a concert hall. Llanharan RFC moved from the old site in 2002 into new premises in the former British Legion club on the opposite side of Bridgend Road. Grounds Llanharan RFC play their matches at The Dairy Field, named for the adjacent CWS Milk Depot which closed in the late 1960s after 50 years of milk processing. The club purchased the ground in 1989, having previously played on the Welfare Ground. Llanharan RFC marked the advent of the national league by playing their first game on the new field against Aberavon Quins to open the 1990-91 season. Colours Llanharan RFC play in black shirts and shorts with three light blue horizontal hoops across the chest. The choice of colours is said to relate to impoverished bygone years when a sympathetic Cardiff gave a set of their kit to the club. The black and Cambridge blue has been worn ever since. In respectful appreciation Llanharan henceforth called themselves the \\"Black and Blues\\" as opposed to the \\"Blue and Blacks\\". Club badge The badge is symbolic of the village's history and culture. The four quarters show: * A sheaf of corn – pre-coal mining Llanharan was an agricultural village with its picturesque stone cottages with a church, corn mill and blacksmith; much of the economy related to the needs of the Llanharan House estate. * A Llanharan spaniel – reputed to be a distinctive breed at a time when the estate also boasted its own pack of hunting hounds. * The parish church of St Julius and Aaron – an ancient foundation that boasts a Tudor chalice. * A pit head winding gear – reflecting the coal mining that dominated the village for almost a century. The Llanharan badge also includes a black cross to commemorate the six players who died on 12 March 1950 in the Llandow air disaster.Rugby in Wales: Llanharan RFC  Club honours  * 2004/05 Glamorgan County President's Cup - Winners * 2003/04 WRU Division One - Champions  Notable former players  :See also :Category:Llanharan RFC players The following players have represented Llanharan and have also been capped at international level. * Gareth Llewellyn * Glyn Llewellyn * Garfield Owen * Daniel Pascoe Senior squad 1\\\\.

As a result of this, different lead angles on both tooth profiles are obtained, so that the tooth thickness is continuously increasing all over the worm length, while the gap between two threads is decreasing. This allows control of backlash. At the worm wheel, the different modules result in different addendum modification coefficients and rolling circle diameters at both flanks. Because of this the profiles are different at the front and at the rear flank. The thickness of each tooth and the tooth gaps remain constant at the circumference of the wheel. Backlash adjustment is done by shifting the worm axially, so that the section of the worm with the needed tooth thickness will be in contact with the wheel, giving the desired backlash (fig. 1). This way, backlash can be easily adjusted to any desired value when mounting the gear, and even worn gears can be readjusted at any time delicately and continuously, without modifying the tooth contact or creating meshing interference.  Other possibilities of backlash adjustment  fig.2 Besides the above explained duplex method, there are various possibilities to adjust the backlash of worm gears: * variation of center distance, by rotating an eccentric hub, in which the worm shaft and/or the worm gear wheel are cradled * axial shifting of a conical worm (fig. 2a) * division of the worm in two halves (fig. 2b), to be rotated or shifted relatively to each other. (system Ott) * division of the wheel in two disks (fig. 2c), to be rotated relatively to each other. However all these methods demonstrate substantial disadvantages: * adjustments and/or readjustments are interfering with the geometrically accurate meshing. * they shift the contact profile zone and change its form and size. * with this they decrease the load-carrying capacity and deteriorate the efficiency. * each adjustment causes a tremendous amount of start-up wear. * the dangers of wrong assembly and destruction of the worm gear set are tremendous. fig.3 part of a duplex worm shaft in a rotary table Duplex gearings do not create these kind of problems. They permit an always geometrically accurate teeth contact and beyond that, very delicate backlash adjustment. Neither the evolved contact area, the load-carrying capacity nor the actual efficiency are affected. In addition as duplex teeth are executed as involute gear they are insensitive in regards to modifications of the center distance, e.g. caused by worm shaft deflections.  Setting of backlash  Installing and resetting of a duplex worm wheelset is typically done as follows: * Mount worm shaft and wheel sequentially. The arrows for positioning on both parts have to point in the same direction. (Fig. 1) * The shaft has to be mounted with bearings in an axial position before position zero. In this position the shaft has still backlash against the wheel. * The wheel is mounted in its housing, but is still axially displaceable, i.e. transverse to the worm shaft axis. * Both flanks of the worm shaft will now be coated with spotting color. Then rotate the shaft by hand in both directions by at least 2 x 360°, so that the marking ink is transferred from the worm flanks to the flanks of the teeth of the wheel. This creates the load pattern in the contact region. * The wheel has to be displaced axially, up to an optimal position where the load pattern on front and back flank are approximately equally distant to the center of the wheel. * In this optimal position the wheel has to be fixed axially. * The shaft can now be screwed in to the zero position (notch in height of the wheel axle) or until another desired backlash. * Now, the shaft is axially secured in this position.  Applications  Duplex gears are mainly utilized where any backlash is unwanted or can be harmful, to maintain repeated high precision positioning in both directions, to prevent impulse loaded damage, and when the contact flanks are alternating. Common applications include: rotary and tilting tables, milling machines, and presses.

It is variant of the American M113 armoured personnel carrier (APC), armed with a 20mm cannon in a rotating turret. Developed by the Norwegian Army in the 1980s, it is no longer in active service. Background Although originally intended as a lightly armoured, self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon system, the NM135 was utilised as a mechanised infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) to transport Stormer troops and in the armed reconnaissance role. First entering service in the early-mid 1980s, it remained in operation until the introduction of the Hägglund CV9030N in the late 1990s and was progressively withdrawn from service in the 2000s. Design=Layout The NM135's primary modification from a standard M113 is the replacement of the commander's cupola with a one-man rotating and powered turret originally made by Hägglund and Söner for the Swedish Pansarbandvagn 302 (Pbv 302) APC. The 20mm Hispano-Suiza cannon on the Pbv 302 was replaced with a 20mm Rheinmetall cannon. A vertical bank of three smoke grenade launchers are fitted to each side of the turret. Conversion and fitting of the turret was undertaken in Norway. The NM135 featured a 3-man crew – driver, gunner and commander. The driver was located in the front left in the same position as a standard M113 and featured the usual arrangement of four vision blocks but with the central optical block replaced with an passive IR block. The driver's hatch was hinged and opened to the right (on a standard M113 the hatch opens to the rear) so as not to impede the commander's cupola. Behind the driver's hatch was located the commander's non-rotatable cupola, which featured vision blocks but no armament. The commander's hatch was hinged and opened to the rear. To the right of the commander's cupola was located the Hägglund turret manned by the vehicle's gunner. Due to size constraints imposed by fitting of the turret, the available space in the troop compartment of a standard M113 was reduced in the NM135, and a maximum of eight troops could be carried. Armament The NM135 has as its primary armament a non-stabilised Rheinmetall mk20 RH-202 20mm autocannon mounted off-centre to the right of the Hägglund and Söner turret. This weapon fires 20 x 139 mm ammunition with a rate of fire of around 900 rounds per minute and features a ballistic computer to assist the gunner in aiming using the weapon's optical and passive IR sights. The turret was also fitted with a Rheinmetall MG3 7.62mm general purpose machine gun mounted coaxially above the 20mm cannon, Firing NATO 7.62×51mm ammunition with a rate of fire of 1,000-1,300 rounds per minute to provide infantry support fire and for use against lightly-armoured vehicles and other 'soft-skinned' targets. A 71 mm LYRAN mortar is also fitted at the rear of the turret which along with illumination rounds could also fire high-explosive / anti-personnel and smoke rounds. Armour The NM135 has the same level of protection as a standard M113 with the hull being made of rolled 5083/5086 H32 aluminium armour of the following thicknesses: *Upper front: 38mm at 45 degrees *Lower front: 38mm at 30 degrees *Upper sides: 44mm *Lower sides 32mm *Rear: 44mm at 9 degrees *Ramp: 44mm at 8 degrees *Top: 38mm at 8 degrees *Floor: 32mm at 90 degrees In 1996 additional appliqué armour (HF9Sp, HS6Sp) was added to the vehicle front and sides for some vehicles deployed on active duty to Bosnia with IFOR.

Caldwell. Joel worked at Bell Labs (1940–83) where he first undertook cryptology studies (collaboration with Claude Shannon), followed by studies on electronic switching system that resulted in the 1ESS switch (1948–60). He then headed the development of advanced telephone services (1961–68), which led to several patents, including one on Traffic Service Position System and a mechanism for handoff in cellular communication (1972). The latter invention made mobile telephony widely available by allowing a multitude of callers to use the limited number of available frequencies simultaneously and by allowing the seamless switching of calls from tower to tower as callers traveled. After 1983, he worked as a consultant to AT&T;, developing mechanisms for optical switching. Joel died in his home in Maplewood, New Jersey, on October 25, 2008, at age 90.

It is the only unit in India that is authorised to manufacture and supply the Indian flag. History KKGSS was founded on 1 November 1957 with the goal of creating a federation that catered to the need for growth of khadi and other village industries. Another aim of the federation was to provide employment opportunities to the rural youth in these sectors. About 58 institutions around the state were brought under the aegis of this federation. The head office is located in Hubli and is spread over an area of of land. The production of khadi began in the year 1982. A training college to train students in textile chemistry is also run by this federation. The goal of this college is to produce technicians who will improve the quality of fabrics.All government officials buy the Indian flags from them. Production The main product of the KKGSS is the Indian flag. Apart from this, it also manufactures khadi clothes, khadi carpets, khadi bags, khadi caps, khadi bedsheets, soaps, handmade paper and processed honey. KKGSS also manufactures tools needed for carpentry, dyeing and blacksmithy and also has a naturopathy hospital in its premises. Earlier the flags were not manufactured according to the BIS guidelines. The unit became unique as a manufacturing center for National flag, when in 2006, it was accredited with ISI certification, along with the authorization to sell the National Flag throughout the country. Currently, the flags are manufactured in accordance with the BIS guidelines, i.e. the national flag “should be made of hand-spun and handwoven cotton khadi bunting.” Indian flag 20px Flag ratio: 3:2 The flag is manufactured by the khadi unit of KKGSS. The Khadi and Village Industries Commission has certified KKGSS as the sole manufacturer and supplier of the Indian flag to the entire country. There are 100 specialist spinners and 100 weavers employed in making the flag. The cloth needed for the flag is sourced from KKGSS's unit in Bagalkot and divided into three lots, each of the lots to be dyed with one of the three major colors in the Indian flag. After dyeing, the cloth is cut in the required size and shape and the blue chakra (wheel) with 24 equally spaced spokes is printed on the white cloth. Finally, the three pieces are stitched together to make the Indian flag. About 60 Japanese sewing machines are used to maintain precision while stitching. Some of the critical confirmation criteria include that the width and length of the entire flag should be in the ratio 3:2 and that the chakra needs to be printed on both the sides of the flag with both of these prints perfectly matched, like two hands joined palm to palm. Each lot shipped is subjected to an inspection by BIS and any issue with a single flag could result in the whole lot being rejected. The flags are manufactured in nine sizes, with the smallest one being 6 × 4 inches (150 X 100 mm) and the biggest one being 21 X 14 feet (6300 X 4200 mm). Business KKGSS's annual turnover is about 15 million ($375,000). The major customers of KKGSS are politicians and people associated with politics. This is because Khadi symbolised self-reliance during the Indian independence movement and was worn by Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders. In the year 2007, KKGSS has sold flags worth 6 million ($150,000).

A candidate of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), he nominated François Fillon as Prime minister, who formed a composite government, a bit modified following the UMP's relative victory during the June legislative election. Although the UMP had not obtained a majority as large as expected, Nicolas Sarkozy could launch the reforms he had pledged as a candidate as soon as he was elected. However, he tried to open his government to the opposition party, appointing several politicians close to the opposition parties. With the quinquennat reform of 2000, the president of the republic has a five-year term to lead freely the domestic policy he wants, if ever he obtains the majority at the legislative election, which is very likely to occur. Traditionally, according to the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic, the main role of the President of the Republic is to determine the foreign policy of the nation, while the Prime Minister is entrusted with leading the domestic policy. However, as François Fillon was politically very close to the President, Nicolas Sarkozy could be very active both in foreign relations and in domestic reforms. French journalists have called him an \\"hyper-président\\", to insist on his will to solve many important problems and his omnipresence in all domains.\\"L'hyper- président\\", Le Monde, 6 June 2007 «Le nouveau président de la République a marqué des points grâce à son style direct, son art de la communication, son omniprésence sur tous les fronts intérieurs et extérieurs, sa volonté affichée d'engager les réformes promises» Some media even compared him with Napoléon Bonaparte and Louis XIV to refer to his will to control and change everything. While the popularity of the president was very high at the beginning of his mandate, it rapidly declined during the first months of his mandate, and the government faced several protests. The presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy was marked by the global financial and economic crisis. As president of the European Union during the last six months of 2008, and as the president of a member country of the G-8 and the G-20, Nicolas Sarkozy was very much involved in the international debates and propositions to fight against the crisis. He had also to cope with the economic and social effects of the crisis in France. In particular, he had to renounce to reduce the public deficit as he had promised, and instead he had to launch a stimulus package, as part of the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, to limit social discontentment. As he had promised to reach full-employment and to boost the economic growth, he faced growing protest. In the 2012 presidential elections, Sarkozy was defeated by Socialist François Hollande by a margin of 3.2%.  Transfer of power  President Sarkozy in 2007 Nicolas Sarkozy was elected president on 6 May 2007, but the official transmission of power took place ten days after. In this period of time, he could not exercise his power nor begin appointing a government. Between 7 and 9 May, he left on holidays with his family off Malta on board a yacht lent by a friend of M.Sarkozy's, Vincent Bolloré. This trip gave rise to some criticism in the media, because Vincent Bolloré was the chairman of the Bolloré Group, one of the biggest and most powerful French conglomerates. However, a poll showed that a majority of people found that this trip was not shocking. The official transfer of power from Jacques Chirac took place on 16 May at 11:00 am (9:00 UTC) at the Élysée Palace, where Nicolas Sarkozy was given the nuclear codes of the French nuclear arsenal and presented with the Grand Master's Collar, symbol of his new function of Grand Master of the Legion of Honour. At that point, he formally became president. Leyenda, by Spanish composer Isaac Albéniz was played in honour of the president's wife. Both Sarkozy's mother Andrée, and his formerly estranged father Pal — with whom Sarkozy had reached a reconciliation — attended the ceremony, as did Sarkozy's children.Radiant Cécilia puts Sarkozy in the shade The presidential motorcade then travelled from the Élysée to the Champs- Élysées for a public ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe. Then the new president went to the Cascade du Bois de Boulogne of Paris for a homage to the French Resistance and to the Communist resistant Guy Moquet -- he proposed that all high-school students read Guy Moquet's last letter to his parents, which was criticized by a number of leftists as a cynical form of reappropriation of French history by the right.

Appointment of the government  Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was replaced by François Fillon on 17 May.Communiqué de la Présidence de la République concernant la nomination du Premier ministre. Élysée Palace, 17 May 2007 Sarkozy appointed Bernard Kouchner, the left-wing founder of Médecins Sans Frontières, as his foreign minister, leading to Kouchner's expulsion from the Socialist Party. In addition to Kouchner, three more Sarkozy ministers are from the left, including Eric Besson, who served as Ségolène Royal's economic adviser at the beginning of her campaign. Sarkozy also appointed seven women to form a total cabinet of 15; one, Justice Minister Rachida Dati, is the first woman of Northern African origin to serve in a French cabinet. Of the 15, only two attended the elite École nationale d'administration (ENA) .France New's Government - A study in perpetual motion, The Economist, 23 June 2007 The ministers were reorganized, with the controversial creation of a Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co-Development -- given to his right-hand man Brice Hortefeux -- and of a Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Administration -- handed out to Éric Wœrth, supposed to prepare the replacement of only a third of all civil servants who retire.François Fillon has been the Prime Minister of Nicolas Sarkozy since the beginning of his presidential mandate. The UMP, Sarkozy's party, won a majority at the June 2007 legislative election, although by less than expected. The presidential party only gained 318 seats out of 577.  First reforms  In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the Nouveau Centre, approved one of Sarkozy's electoral promise, which was to quasi-suppress the inheritance tax.Les députés votent la quasi-suppression des droits de succession, Le Figaro, 13 July 2007 Les droits de succession (presque) supprimés, Libération, 13 July 2007 The inheritance tax used to bring eight billion euros into state coffers.Droits de succession : pour une minorité de ménages aisés, L'Humanité, 7 June 2007 This reform was included in a fiscal stimulus package that allegedly aimed at reviving the economic growth. However, the TEPA Law, another measure of the stimulus package, sparked a polemic because it seemed to favour richest households through tax cuts. Furthermore, Sarkozy cut with the custom of amnestying traffic tickets and of releasing some prisoners from overcrowded jails on Bastille Day, a tradition that Napoleon had started in 1802 to commemorate the storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution Molly Moore, France's Sarkozy Off to a Running Start, Washington Post, 4 August 2007 Fillon's government issued a decree on 7 August 2007 to generalize a voluntary biometric profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called Parafes, was to use fingerprints. The new database would be interconnected with the Schengen Information System (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons (Fichier des personnes recherchées, FPR). The CNIL protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français, Le Monde, 8 August 2007 In November 2007, Sarkozy faced his first domestic test when workers from the public sector struck to protest his domestic reform policies. At the same time, there were also the university protests in response to a polemical law supported by the UMP, MoDem and Nouveau Centre that reforms the university system in France. The first debates on the reform of French health care system were also tough.  First international actions  Shortly after taking office, President Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president Álvaro Uribe and the left-wing guerrilla FARC, regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's \\"chancellor\\" Rodrigo Granda.Llama G8 a FARC contribuir a liberación de rehenes , La Cronica, 8 June 2007  Release of Bulgarian nurses  During his investiture speech as President beginning of May 2007, Sarkozy had alluded to the Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya, declaring: \\"France will be to the sides of the Libyan nurses detained for 8 years...\\"French language: \\"La France sera aux côtés des infirmières libyennes enfermées depuis huit ans…\\", Vidéo : Premier discours du président Sarkozy, RFI, 6 May 2007 He announced on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya to their country.

Additionally, President Sarkozy pledged to sell Libya three civil nuclear power stations as part of a package of trade and assistance that will boost the role of French companies in the oil-rich country. During his visit to Libya on 25 July 2007, Sarkozy signed an agreement of cooperation on civil nuclear technology.

Furthermore, Le Parisien alleged on 13 August 2007 that the agreement concerning nuclear technologies did not concern desalinization of sea water, but focused on particular on the ERP third-generation nuclear reactor, of a worth of $3 billion.Marc Lomazzi, Nucléaire: les dessous de l'accord entre la France et la Libye, Le Parisien, 13 August 2007 The Parisian newspaper cited Philippe Delaune, the deputy of the deputy director of international affairs of the CEA atomic agency, which is the main share-holder of Areva, the firm which products ERP reactors. Although the French President denied any relationship between the deal with Areva and the liberation of the Six, Le Parisien points out a troubling chronology: Areva was called to present its products to Libya end of June 2007, a short time before the release of the Six. The French Socialist Party, through the voice of Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was \\"geopolitically irresponsible\\". The German government also denounced the agreement. Through Siemens, they detain 34% of the shares of Areva's subsidiary in charge of building the ERP (Areva NP). These informations from Le Parisien were immediately denied by Areva.Areva: \\"pas de négociations sur l'EPR avec la Libye\\" , L'Express with Reuters, 13 August 2007 Areva's spokesman did admit that negotiations had taken place early June 2007, but that no particular technology transfer had been agreed upon. Furthermore, Philippe Delaune, the CEA's spokesman, added that in any case, any transfer concerning the ERP technology would take at least ten or fifteen years. While Areva did admit that general negotiations had taken place, Nicolas Sarkozy formally dismissed all of the story, claiming it was \\"false\\".Sarkozy denies Libya arms deal , France 24 (with AFP), 13 August 2007Nicolas Sarkozy et Areva démentent tout projet de vente de réacteur EPR à la Libye, Le Monde (with Reuters), 13 August 2007 Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov also claimed that the arms and nuclear agreements were not related to the release of the nurses.Report on reactor for Libyans ‘false’ , Gulf Times (with AFP), 14 August 2007 African speech On 27 July 2007, Sarkozy delivered a speech in Senegal, written by Henri Guaino, in which he made reference to \\"African peasants\\"News24.com; 28 July 2007; Sarkozy's Africa vision under fire Chris McGreal;The Guardian (UK)27 August 2007 Mbeki criticised for praising 'racist' Sarkozy (note that the French word \\"paysans\\" can be translated as either \\"peasants\\" or as \\"rural people\\") and said that colonialism was not the cause of all of Africa's problems, France made mistakes in Africa though \\"did not exploit anyone\\", and asked young Africans to fight against corruption and violence. The remarks were widely condemned by African intellectuals; many, such as Achille Mbembe, Mamadou Diouf or Ibrahima Thioub, viewed them not only as racist, but as displaying a deep ignorance by Sarkozy of African studies, wondering how it was possible to hold similar discourses in 2008.Michel Agier, l'Afrique en France après le discours de Dakar, Vacarme n°42 Achille Mbembe; Mail and Guardian (South Africa); 27 August 2007; Sacré bleu! Mbeki and Sarkozy? Alpha Oumar Konare, head of the African Union commission, said \\"This speech was not the kind of break we were hoping for... It reminded us of another age, especially his comments about peasants.\\" Other criticism was levelled at Sarkozy's failure to acknowledge the previous role of France in propping up abusive regimes. The French government defended Sarkozy's speech, saying that he also criticised the economics of globalisation and proposed a partnership to help Africa confront it. Konare's wife Adame Ba Konare also started a movement of promotion of African History following Sarkozy's speech. South African president Thabo Mbeki praised Sarkozy's speech and called him a \\"citizen of Africa\\", which raised criticism by some in the South African media. Religion In 2004, Nicolas Sarkozy published a book called La République, les religions, l'espérance (\\"The Republic, Religions, and Hope\\"), in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on secular or republican values. He also advocated reducing the separation of church and state, arguing for the government subsidy of mosques in order to encourage Islamic integration into French society.\\"L'Etat Doit-Il Financer La Construction de Mosquees?\\" He flatly opposes financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with Tom Cruise, Sarkozy was criticised by some for meeting with a member of the Church of Scientology, which is classified as a cult (secte translates \\"cult\\") in France (see Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France).Worldwide Religious News, 2 September 2004 Sarkozy stated that \\"the roots of France are essentially Christian\\" at a speech in Rome in December 2007. He also called Islam as \\"one of the greatest and most beautiful civilizations the world has known\\" at a speech in Riyadh in January 2008. Both comments drew criticism. Sarkozy visited Pope Benedict XVI on 20 December 2007, and formally received the title of Honorary Chanoine of the Basilica of St. John Lateran, which is automatically conferred to each French President.\\"Le président Sarkozy chanoine d'honneur de la basilique Saint-Jean de Latran\\" On his visit to the Pope, Sarkozy was accompanied by French comedian Jean-Marie Bigard, was late, and text-messaged during the audience. This behaviour has led some people to advance that he is not cultured enough to be in office.\\"A lowbrow in high office ruffles France\\", by Michael Kimmelman, 15 April 2008, New York Times  August 2007 vacations  U.S. President George W.

He was expected to stay in the 11-bathroom shorefront mansion of former Microsoft executive Michael Appe. However, he interrupted his vacation for a one-day trip to France after the death of Cardinal Lustiger, former archbishop of Paris, whose funeral he was to attend.Nicolas Sarkozy assistera aux obsèques du cardinal Lustiger, L'Express, 9 August 2007 A presidential plane flew him on 10 August to Paris and then back to America. He visited President George W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Maine, and returned to France by commercial jet on 21 August.  Gaddafi's visit  From 10 to 15 December, Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi visited Paris. It was a polemical official trip. The Secretary of Human Rights, Rama Yade, argued that it was not acceptable for France to receive on its territory a man that did not respect human rights. Foreign Affairs Ministry Bernard Kouchner supported her and did not meet Gaddafi.  Personal life  Nicolas Sarkozy was also much criticised at the beginning of 2008, with his divorce and then with his remarriage with singer and ex-model Carla Bruni in January 2008. Indeed, he appeared as over-mediatised and omnipresent, and criticism of hyperpresidency were common. In February 2008, at the annual Salon of Agriculture, Sarkozy declared \\"Casse toi pauv’con !\\" (which can be translated as \\"beat it, you poor twat\\"), to a visitor that had refused to shake his hand. He was much criticised for this episode. As his personal popularity was decreasing very rapidly since his election, his party lost the local elections in March 2008.  French local elections 2008  Sarkozy's conservative party braced for a possible setback as voting got under way on 16 March 2008 local elections which was seen as the new conservative leader's first electoral test and a barometer of the strength of his Union for a Popular Movement-party, which was hoping to hang on Marseille and Toulouse. Ten months after his election, France's economy remained sluggish and Sarkozy had backed off from many of the sweeping reforms that he promised on the campaign trail. A UMP loss 16 March 2008 could weaken Sarkozy's bid to live up to his promises of economic, social and institutional reforms. The municipal elections coincide with a recent plunge in Sarkozy's popularity. His ratings steadily slipped in the wake of a series of angry public outbursts, a widely publicized divorce, and a quick courtship and marriage to former model and singer Carla Bruni. The first round 2008 French municipal elections on 9 March 2008 gave the rival Socialist Party a lead: 47.5 percent of the vote compared with 44.4 percent for the UMP. Nicolas Sarkozy braces for election bruising, CNN, 16 March 2008 The Socialist Party took over many cities from the UMP, a defeat for the presidential party and a sign of disapproval of the government.  Foreign policy decisions  Nicolas Sarkozy with Presidents Bush (Senior and Junior)  NATO  Sarkozy tried to strengthen the ties with the United States after they had been loosened when Jacques Chirac decided not to take part in the Iraq War in 2003. Sarkozy announced that France would send 1,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, it was reported 22 March 2008. He demonstrated his commitment to the NATO alliance's Afghan mission during his two-day visit to London, which started on 28 March 2008.Report: France to boost Afghan commitment, CNN, 23 March 2008 On 3 April 2008, during the Bucharest summit, Nicolas Sarkozy announced that France was likely to rejoin NATO's military structure (In 1966 France withdrew from NATO's command structure, but not from NATO overall), and confirmed that he would send more troops to Myanmar.

The agreement came at the end of the first day of a two-day EU summit.Sarkozy touts Mediterranean plan, CNN, 14 March 2008  Global warming  On 8 June 2007, during the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Sarkozy set a goal of reducing French CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050 in order to prevent global warming. He then pushed forward the important Socialist figure of Dominique Strauss-Kahn as European nominee to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).FMI : Strauss-Kahn candidat officiel de l’Union européenne, Le Figaro, 10 July 2007 Critics alleged that Sarkozy proposed to nominate Strauss-Kahn as managing director of the IMF to deprive the Socialist Party of one of its more popular figures.Reuters, \\"France's Sarkozy wants Strauss-Kahn as IMF head\\" Sat 7 July 2007 2:38PM EDT read here The Libyan civil war Sarkozy's government took an unexpected step regarding the 2011 Libyan civil war: after some initial confusion they supported the National Transitional Council, opposed to Muammar Gaddafi. The main negotiator on behalf of the Libyan people was Mahmoud Jibril. The influence of the philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, who visited Benghazi, was considered fundamental.France’s goals in Libya hit a little closer to home  European presidency = Internationals summits  President Sarkozy was present at the three G20 summits led in 2008 and 2009 in Washington, London, and Pittsburgh, and made various propositions. Before the London summit, he threatened not to attend it if other leaders did not promise to take decisive measures. He wanted all leaders to be committed to refund the capitalism upon new basis and to introduce more morals in finance. He demanded that environmental concerns be at the center of G20 leaders' preoccupations. He also proposed to reduce the bonuses granted to traders and bankers.

This is combined with the high unemployment and lower salaries compared to Metropolitan France. They were started in Guadeloupe and spread to Martinique and Réunion.

Early years Born in Ashland County, Ohio, in 1840, David Rodocker opened his first photography studio in Champaign, Illinois. He moved to Winfield, Kansas, in late 1870 where he opened a studio by the following year. Black Hills visit In January 1877, Rodocker sold his Winfield studio and took his camera on the road to the Black Hills, spending the summer producing views of the mines and mining towns. He departed the Black Hills in October 1877, apparently heading south and passing through the Red Cloud Agency in northwestern Nebraska where he produced several additional photographs. He arrived about a month after the death of Crazy Horse so he could not have produced a portrait of the famed Oglala Sioux war leader. Later years Rodocker traveled to Chicago where he purchased new equipment and made arrangements with publisher L. M. Melander to market and sell his views.

It was built with the expectation of conveying coal from the Fife coalfields to a quay at Bowling on the Clyde for onward transport, but that traffic did not materialise. The line opened in 1856; it was a simple rural line running through sparsely populated terrain, and traffic was thin. In 1882 the Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway made a connection with the line, using a few miles of it as part of its own route to Aberfoyle. The Forth and Clyde Junction route lost its passenger train service in 1934, but the Aberfoyle trains continued until they too were discontinued in 1951. Goods train continued on parts of the line, but in 1965 the line was completely closed, and none of it remains in railway use. History=First proposal In 1845 there was a frenzy of railway promotion in Scotland; the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had been opened in 1842 and shown that railways of more than purely local relevance could be successful, and many schemes were put forward. Considerable volumes of coal were being extracted in Fife. While coastwise and export shipping from east coast ports was carried on, there was a commercial need to get access to the west coast ports. A railway to make the transit to the lower Clyde was proposed, but after 1845 the money market collapsed, and nothing further was heard of the idea for some years. A practicable scheme System map of the Forth and Clyde Junction RailwayBy 1850 the railway network was developing, and Stirling was becoming a focal point for railways. The Stirling and Dunfermline Railway opened in 1850, connecting the Fife coalfields. However, when traffic was consigned from Fife to the west coast, the S&DR;, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway and its associated companies were obliged to hand over the traffic to rival companies - the Scottish Central Railway and the Caledonian Railway - to complete the transit. In 1851 a Forth and Clyde Junction Railway was promoted by commercial interests in Stirling to build a line north of the Campsie Fells to reach the harbour at Bowling, on the River Clyde. The line would connect with the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway (C&DJR; the spelling Dumbartonshire was used by the company). The C&DJR; opened in 1850 and although it had intended to reach Glasgow, its finances only permitted construction from Balloch to Bowling; the F&CJR; would join it near Alexandria, in the Leven Valley.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, The Forth and Clyde Junction Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 4 August 1853;E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Stewart Noble, The Vanished Railways of Old Western Dunbartonshire, The History Press, Stroud, 2010, the line was to be 30 miles (48 km) in length, and the trunk haul traffic, minerals westbound to the Clyde and manufactured textiles from the Leven dyeworks eastbound, was to be dominant. Construction was relatively straightforward; the line was built as a single line, although land was acquired for subsequent doubling. There were two major river crossings, of the Leven and the Endrick. The Leven bridge was a large timber viaduct, probably one of the last wooden bridges to be built in Scotland. (It had to be replaced by a metal bridge after about twenty years.) The Endrick crossing was a long low timber trestle. Opening The line opened in two stages: the eastern half opened as far as Buchlyvie on 18 March 1856, followed by the western half on 26 May 1856.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, The line had been authorised to make a south-facing connection with the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway near Alexandria, reflecting the intended trunk haulage to the Clyde. In fact the actual construction arranged the connection facing Balloch. This seems to have been done without proper authority, and the reason for the change is unclear; it may have been simply an acceptance that the through goods traffic would lay over at Balloch.In those days, primitive lubrication of wagon bearings required attention at frequent intervals, and this may have been more simply achieved at Balloch. There were 32 manned level crossings on the route. The line in operation By the time the line was open, the attraction of operating coal traffic over the line and back to Bowling had faded; there were shorter transits to better harbours on the Clyde, and the trunk traffic never materialised. Moreover, the population on the line itself was fairly limited, and some of the communities on the line were located some distance from the stations that purported to serve them. Drymen station was really in the smaller village of Croftamie, and Balfron (probably the largest village on the route) was not very near Balfron station. The line settled down to its role as a simple rural route, although some tourist traffic was developed. The Dalmonach Dyeworks near Balloch sought a branch connection from the F&CJR; competitors further down the Leven Valley had connections from the C&DJR.; The short branch was authorised on 1 August 1861. The company operated the railway itself, although it hired in engine power from the Scottish Central Railway at first, but the arrangement was terminated from 7 February 1860, as the F&CJR; considered the SCR's price was excessive. Locomotive power was hired in from the Scottish North Eastern Railway until four 2-4-0 tender engines were delivered by from the Canada Works, Birkenhead, early in 1861. Lease to the NBR From 1865 the North British Railway and the Caledonian Railway expressed interest in acquiring the F&CJR.; Absorption by the Caledonian Railway looked promising: as well as good terms the Caledonian would upgrade and modernise the track, but Parliament refused the necessary authority.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, , page 168 The NBR withdrew an opposing Parliamentary Bill it had prepared for the purpose. The company decided to remain independent, but it agreed to lease the line to the North British Railway from 1866. On 1 August 1871 the lease was concluded; the NBR would pay 50% of gross revenue for 30 years. On 1 August 1875 the term was extended to 50 years, paying 6% on the F&CJR;'s capital of £106,000, rising with the potential dividend on NBR ordinary stock..David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The company itself continued, receiving the lease charge but not operating any railway, until the grouping of railways in Great Britain in 1923. Part of the lease agreement was that the remaining timber bridges on the line should be rebuilt in durable materials at the expense of the F&CJR.; The Endrick timber trestle viaduct was now in a very poor state, having been repeatedly damaged by ice in the river during the 1860s, and it was rebuilt with iron truss girders on stone piers. Passenger train service The 1895 Bradshaw shows four through trains daily from Balloch to Stirling, with an additional short working from Balloch to Balfron. The throughout journey time was about two hours.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, The Aberfoyle line The North British Railway sponsored a nominally independent line to reach Aberfoyle, an important town in the expanding tourist trade, and the Gateway to the Trossachs. The line was authorised as the Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway. It opened on 1 August 1882. It ran for a few miles on the F&CJR; line, joining it at Gartness Junction and leaving it again at Buchlyvie Junction.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 2, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1975, , pageds 127 and 128 The twentieth century The line passed into the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. As early as the 1920s bus competition eroded the already limited passenger carryings on the line. The LNER tried to reduce costs of the loss-making passenger service by introducing a steam railcar, Quicksilver, manufactured by the Sentinel Waggon Works in Shrewsbury. It had a vertical boiler power plant and geared drive. However its effect on the viability of the passenger business was insignificant. The thin population density on the route never became sufficient to sustain a passenger service, and the line was closed as a through passenger route on 1 October 1934.Gordon Stansfield, Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2002, The former Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway route, now simply the Aberfoyle branch of the LNER, remained open for passenger traffic until 29 September 1951: the trains worked over the F&CJR; route between Gartness and Buchlyvie. Final closures By 1949 the section between Drymen and Gartness was listed as \\"out of use\\", probably due to the state of the Endrick Viaduct. The section was formally closed on 1 November 1950. Successive closures to goods traffic followed: Buchlyvie Junction to Mye Siding also closed completely on 1 November 1950. The section from Mye Siding to Port of Menteith followed on 1 December 1952. On 5 October 1959 the sections between Gartness Junction and Buchlyvie Junction, Jamestown and Drymen, and from Port of Menteith to Stirling closed. On 1 September 1964 the short section from Croftengea Siding to Jamestown closed, and finally the Croftengea Siding stub closed on 9 April 1965. The entire route is now closed. About 1969 a water main was erected crossing the Endrick, using the stone piers of the viaduct. A cycle path was later constructed on the route. The Leven viaduct near Balloch is now a pedestrian walkway.Gordon Stansfield, Glasgow and Dunbartonshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2003, Topography The line opened from Forth and Clyde Junction, Balloch to Buchlyvie on 26 May 1856, and from Buchlyvie to Stirling North Junction on 18 March 1856,. It closed to passenger services on 1 October 1934, except between Gartness and Buchlyvie, which closed on 29 September 1951. Locations on the line were: * Forth and Clyde Junction; diverged from the Balloch to Dumbarton line; * Jamestown; industrial line to Dalmonach Works diverged; * Kilmaronock; renamed Caldarvan in January 1877;At the request of R D MacKenzie of Caldarvan House, according to Noble. * Drymen; * Endrick Viaduct; * Gartness; * Gartness Junction; line from Lennoxtown converged; * Balfron; * Balwill siding; * Buchlyvie; line to Aberfoyle diverged; it ran alongside the Stirling line for a short distance; * Mye Siding; * Cardross; renamed Port of Monteith May 1858;A Cardross station near Helensburgh had opened in March 1858. renamed Port of Mentieth 1880; * Ladylands Siding (station); opened June 1861; Fridays only at first, then Saturdays only, later Thursdays only; renamed Ladylands Platform 11 July 1927; * Fairfields Siding (station); opened June 1861; Fridays only; also known as Fairfield; closed 20 October 1866; * Kippen; * Gargunnock; * Stirling North Junction; converged with Perth to Stirling line.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales—A Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 NotesReferencesSources  Railscot on Forth and Clyde Junction Railway Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:North British Railway Category:Early Scottish railway companies Category:Closed railway lines in Scotland Category:Railway lines opened in 1856 Category:London and North Eastern Railway constituents ","title":"Forth and Clyde Junction Railway"},{"id":"12691594","text":"Linthorpe Cemetery is the oldest working cemetery in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England.

It was the last election for a university constituency of the UK Parliament; the Combined Scottish Universities was abolished along with the other university seats for the 1950 general election.  Vacancy  The seat had become vacant on 16 October 1946 when the independent Member of Parliament (MP) Sir John Boyd Orr had resigned by the procedural device of accepting the post of Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, a notional 'office of profit under the crown' which is used as a procedural device to enable MPs to resign from the Commons. After his resignation, Boyd took up the position of Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. He had held the seat he was first elected at a by-election in 1945.  Candidates  Five candidates contested the by-election, none of whom had stood in 1945. The Unionist candidate was Walter Elliot, who had been MP for Glasgow Kelvingrove for more than 20 years, until his narrow defeat at the 1945 general election. He had been Secretary of State for Scotland from 1936 to 1938. The Labour Party candidate was the philosopher and broadcaster C. E. M. Joad. The Liberal Party fielded J. M. Bannerman, who had contested Argyll in 1945, and the National Liberals nominated Dr R. S. Stevenson, who had stood in West Fife in 1945. The fifth candidate was J. G. Jameson, a member of the Federal Union who stood as an advocate of the policies of the Federal Union, although the union did not endorse his candidacy.  Result  The result was a clear victory for the Unionist candidate, Walter Elliot, who won over 68% of the votes, and a majority of more than 50% over the second-placed Labour candidate. Elliot held the seat until the university constituencies were abolished for the 1950 general election.

Robert Barnewall, 12th Baron Trimlestown (c.1704 – 6 December 1779) was a prominent Anglo-Irish landowner, active in the Roman Catholic cause. Early life Robert was the eldest son of John Barnewall, 11th Baron Trimlestown (1672–1746). Robert's mother, John's wife and cousin, was Mary or Margaret Barnewall (died 1771), daughter of Sir John Barnewall, Recorder of Dublin and Thomasine Preston. Robert had two surviving younger brothers, including the short-lived soldier Anthony Barnewall, all three being educated privately. Robert travelled abroad extensively in his youth, studying botany and medicine.O'Brien (2004) Return to Ireland Barnewall returned home to Trimlestown Castle in Ireland in 1746 when he inherited his title and quickly became known for his stylish living and hospitality, extending to generous help to local poor people. By 1746, Catholics in Ireland were wholly disenfranchised by a series of acts of policy of the British government (see Ireland 1691–1801: The Penal Laws). Barnewall saw himself as an inheritor of the Hiberno-Norman establishment but, by the mid 18th century, agitation in the Catholic cause had shifted from the gentry to the rising merchant and professional classes. Thus, in 1759, Barnewall split with the mercantile Catholics and mounted his own reform campaign but with little initial success. An offer that Catholics enlist in the armed forces was rebuffed in 1762, a humiliation compounded when his son Thomas converted to Protestantism. Barnewall's return to politics in 1775 was marked by a more conciliatory approach to his fellow Catholics and he was crucial to a successful project to develop an oath of allegiance acceptable to the Catholic laity. Barnewall soon assumed the authority to speak for the entire Irish Catholic cause, including the Catholic Committee. With the British government engaged by the American Revolutionary War, Barnewall renewed his earlier offer of enlistment. The renewed offer was timely. The British government's Quebec Act of 1774, which had granted concessions to Catholics in Quebec, had been condemned by the revolutionaries, and the Irish Catholic community was experiencing a wave of pro-British establishment enthusiasm. However, such patriotic fervour itself roused Protestant hostility in Dublin. Barnewall's intervention to moderate Catholic passion was admired both by the British government and his Catholic following. His health deteriorating, his final political act was to head the list of signatories to the Catholic address of loyalty to the new Lord Lieutenant of Ireland John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire in 1777. Barnewall died in Dublin and was buried at Trimlestown. Personal life He married three times: #Margaret (died c.1740), daughter of James Rochfort of Laragh, County Kildare; #Elizabeth, daughter of John Colt of Brightlingsea and his wife Elizabeth Man (in or before 1757); and #Anne (died 1831), the fifth daughter of William Hervey of London and his wife Elizabeth Barfoot. He appears to have had at least four sons, though two died very young. Two surviving sons, Thomas, and Mathias, adhered to the Anglican Church of Ireland. He had at least one daughter Bridget, who married Robert Martin FitzAnthony: they were the parents of the well known politician Richard Martin (\\"Humanity Dick\\").

Most of it is in the city of Riviera Beach, but the town of Palm Beach Shores occupies its southern tip. Its latitude of is 26.784 N and its longitude is −80.037; Florida's easternmost point is in Palm Beach Shores. Before the Palm Beach Inlet was created, Singer Island was connected to the island of Palm Beach to the south.  History  Portrait photograph of Paris Singer, 1916 Named after Palm Beach developer Paris Singer, a son of the Singer Sewing Machine magnate Isaac Singer, Singer Island has parks, marinas, hiking and bike paths, as well as of white sand beachPhotos on Flickr that has been considered one of the top five beaches in Palm Beach County. Singer Island is from North Palm Beach, from West Palm Beach, from Palm Beach Gardens, from Juno Beach, and from Jupiter. Singer Island was originally planned by Paris Singer as a development called Palm Beach Ocean. Along with Addison Mizner, Singer intended to build a luxury resort hotel called the Paris Singer Hotel on the south end of the island, and a more typical resort called the Blue Heron toward the north, with homes and a golf course in between. Due to problems clearing titles, Singer's plans changed, and he decided to build only the luxury hotel on the island's south end and to call it the Blue Heron. Virtually every home lot in Palm Beach Ocean was sold, and $2 million (the equivalent of approximately $28 million in 2018) was poured into the Blue Heron. However, due to the abrupt end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s, not a single house was built on any of lots, and the Blue Heron was left uncompleted. Its shell was razed in 1940. The Hilton Singer Island Oceanfront Resort now stands in its place.  Notable residents  Today, Singer Island is a picturesque, upscale and pristine home to thousands of condo owners. The tallest building is the 42-story \\"Tiara\\", which has been severely damaged by several hurricanes since 2004. Its residents were displaced from 2004 to 2008. Singer Island is home to professional golfer Michelle McGann, a longtime resident, and was also home to rocker and E Street Band member Clarence Clemons.

All dinosauriforms are distinguished by several features, such as shortened forelimbs and a partially to fully perforated acetabulum, the hole in the hip socket traditionally used to define dinosaurs. The oldest known dinosauriform is Asilisaurus, a silesaurid which may have lived as early as the Anisian age of the middle Triassic period, about 245 million years ago.  Definition  Dinosauriformes was coined in 1992 by F.E. Novas, who used it to encompass dinosaurs, Lagosuchus, \\"Pseudolagosuchus\\", and the herrerasaurids, which he did not consider to be \\"eudinosaurs\\" (true dinosaurs like ornithischians and saurischians). Contrary to Novas, most paleontologists since 1992 have considered herrerasaurids to be true dinosaurs, though many other primitive, dinosaur-like reptiles still fall within his definition of Dinosauriformes. Dinosauriformes lies within a slightly larger clade, Dinosauromorpha, which corresponds to all reptiles closer to dinosaurs than to pterosaurs. Novas (1992) defined Dinosauriformes as a node-based clade containing the most recent common ancestor of Lagosuchus and Dinosauria, and all its descendants. Nesbitt (2011) provided a roughly equivalent definition, using Marasuchus and Passer domesticus (the house sparrow, a representative of dinosaurs). In his analysis, Dinosauriformes included dinosaurs, silesaurids, and Marasuchus, but not lagerpetids, which were considered a more primitive family of dinosauromorphs.

Extending scalar function to matrix functions  There are several techniques for lifting a real function to a square matrix function such that interesting properties are maintained. All of the following techniques yield the same matrix function, but the domains on which the function is defined may differ.  Power series  If the real function has the Taylor expansion :f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)\\\\cdot x + f(0)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\\\cdots then a matrix function can be defined by substituting by a matrix: the powers become matrix powers, the additions become matrix sums and the multiplications become scaling operations. If the real series converges for x < r, then the corresponding matrix series will converge for matrix argument if \\\\A\\\\ < r for some matrix norm cdot\\\\ which satisfies \\\\ABleq \\\\Acdot\\\\B\\\\. Diagonalizable matrices If the matrix is diagonalizable, the problem may be reduced to an array of the function on each eigenvalue. This is to say we can find a matrix and a diagonal matrix such that A = P~ D~ P^{-1}. Applying the power series definition to this decomposition, we find that is defined by :f(A) = P \\\\begin{bmatrix} f(d_1) & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & \\\\dots & f(d_n) \\\\end{bmatrix} P^{-1} ~, where d_1, \\\\dots, d_n denote the diagonal entries of D. For example, suppose one is seeking ! = (+1) for :A= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&3\\\\ 2&1 \\\\end{bmatrix} ~. One has :A = P \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1-\\\\sqrt{6}& 0 \\\\ 0 & 1+ \\\\sqrt{6} \\\\end{bmatrix} P^{-1}~, for : P= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} &\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\end{bmatrix} ~. Application of the formula then simply yields : A! = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6} } & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6} } \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Gamma(2-\\\\sqrt{6}) & 0\\\\ 0&\\\\Gamma(2+\\\\sqrt{6}) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\sqrt{6}/2 \\\\ 1 & \\\\sqrt{6}/2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\approx \\\\begin{bmatrix} 3.6274 & 8.8423\\\\ 5.8949 & 3.6274 \\\\end{bmatrix} ~. Likewise, : A^4 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6} } & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6} } \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} (1-\\\\sqrt{6})^4 & 0\\\\ 0&(1+\\\\sqrt{6})^4 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\sqrt{6}/2 \\\\ 1 & \\\\sqrt{6}/2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 73 & 84\\\\ 56 & 73 \\\\end{bmatrix} ~.  Jordan decomposition  All complex matrices, whether they are diagonalizable or not, have a Jordan normal form A = P\\\\,J\\\\,P^{-1}, where the matrix J consists of Jordan blocks. Consider these blocks separately and apply the power series to a Jordan block: : f \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\lambda & 1 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda & 1 & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ldots & \\\\ddots & \\\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\\\ldots & \\\\ldots & 0 & \\\\lambda \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{f(\\\\lambda)}{0!} & \\\\frac{f'(\\\\lambda)}{1!} & \\\\frac{f(\\\\lambda)}{2!} & \\\\ldots & \\\\frac{f^{(n)}(\\\\lambda)}{n!} \\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{f(\\\\lambda)}{0!} & \\\\frac{f'(\\\\lambda)}{1!} & \\\\vdots & \\\\frac{f^{(n-1)}(\\\\lambda)}{(n-1)!} \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ldots & \\\\ddots & \\\\frac{f(\\\\lambda)}{0!} & \\\\frac{f'(\\\\lambda)}{1!} \\\\ 0 & \\\\ldots & \\\\ldots & 0 & \\\\frac{f(\\\\lambda)}{0!} \\\\end{bmatrix}. This definition can be used to extend the domain of the matrix function beyond the set of matrices with spectral radius smaller than the radius of convergence of the power series. Note that there is also a connection to divided differences. A related notion is the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition which expresses a matrix as a sum of a diagonalizable and a nilpotent part. = Hermitian matrices = A Hermitian matrix has all real eigenvalues and can always be diagonalized by a unitary matrix P, according to the spectral theorem. In this case, the Jordan definition is natural. Moreover, this definition allows one to extend standard inequalities for real functions: If f(a) \\\\leq g(a) for all eigenvalues of A, then f(A) \\\\preceq g(A) . (As a convention, X \\\\preceq Y \\\\Leftrightarrow Y - X is a positive-semidefinite matrix.) The proof follows directly from the definition.  Cauchy integral  Cauchy's integral formula from complex analysis can also be used to generalize scalar functions to matrix functions. Cauchy's integral formula states that for any analytic function defined on a set , one has :f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_{!!!!!C}! {\\\\frac{f(z)}{z-x}}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}z ~, where is a closed simple curve inside the domain enclosing . Now, replace by a matrix and consider a path inside that encloses all eigenvalues of . One possibility to achieve this is to let be a circle around the origin with radius larger than ‖‖ for an arbitrary matrix norm ‖•‖. Then, is definable by :f(A) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_{!!!!!C}! {f(z)(zI-A)^{-1}}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}z~. This integral can readily be evaluated numerically using the trapezium rule, which converges exponentially in this case. That means that the precision of the result doubles when the number of nodes is doubled. In routine cases, this is bypassed by Sylvester's formula. This idea applied to bounded linear operators on a Banach space, which can be seen as infinite matrices, leads to the holomorphic functional calculus.  Matrix perturbations  The above Taylor power series allows the scalar x to be replaced by the matrix. This is not true in general when expanding in terms of A(\\\\eta) = A+\\\\eta B about \\\\eta = 0 unless [A,B]=0. A counterexample is f(x) = x^{3}, which has a finite length Taylor series. We compute this in two ways, * Distributive law: :f(A+\\\\eta B) = (A+\\\\eta B)^{3} = A^{3} + \\\\eta(A^{2}B + ABA + BA^{2}) + \\\\eta^{2}(AB^{2} + BAB + B^{2}A) + \\\\eta^{3}B^{3} * Using scalar Taylor expansion for f(a+\\\\eta b) and replacing scalars with matrices at the end : :\\\\begin{array}{rcl} f(a+\\\\eta b) &=& f(a) + f'(a)\\\\frac{\\\\eta b}{1!} + f(a)\\\\frac{(\\\\eta b)^{2}}{2!} + f'(a)\\\\frac{(\\\\eta b)^{3}}{3!} [.5em] &=& a^{3} + 3a^{2}(\\\\eta b) + 3a(\\\\eta b)^{2} + (\\\\eta b)^{3} [.5em] &\\\\to & A^{3} + 3A^{2}(\\\\eta B) + 3A(\\\\eta B)^{2} + (\\\\eta B)^{3} \\\\end{array} The scalar expression assumes commutativity while the matrix expression does not, and thus they cannot be equated directly unless [A,B]=0. For some f(x) this can be dealt with using the same method as scalar Taylor series. For example, f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{x}. If A^{-1} exists then f(A+\\\\eta B) = f(\\\\mathbb{I} + \\\\eta A^{-1}B)f(A). The expansion of the first term then follows the power series given above, :f(\\\\mathbb{I} + \\\\eta A^{-1}B) = \\\\mathbb{I} - \\\\eta A^{-1}B + (-\\\\eta A^{-1}B)^{2} + \\\\ldots = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} (-\\\\eta A^{-1}B)^{n} The convergence criteria of the power series then apply, requiring \\\\Vert \\\\eta A^{-1}B \\\\Vert to be sufficiently small under the appropriate matrix norm. For more general problems, which cannot be rewritten in such a way that the two matrices commute, the ordering of matrix products produced by repeated application of the Leibniz rule must be tracked.  Arbitrary function of a 2×2 matrix  An arbitrary function f(A) of a 2×2 matrix A has its Sylvester's formula simplify to : f(A) = \\\\frac{f(\\\\lambda_+) + f(\\\\lambda_-)}{2} I + \\\\frac{A - \\\\left (\\\\frac{tr(A)}{2}\\\\right )I}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left (\\\\frac{tr(A)}{2}\\\\right )^2 - A}} \\\\frac{f(\\\\lambda_+) - f(\\\\lambda_-)}{2} ~, where \\\\lambda_\\\\pm are the eigenvalues of its characteristic equation, A-λI=0, and are given by : \\\\lambda_\\\\pm = \\\\frac{tr(A)}{2} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\left (\\\\frac{tr(A)}{2}\\\\right )^2 - A} .  Examples  * Algebraic Riccati equation * Matrix polynomial * Matrix root * Matrix logarithm * Matrix exponential  Classes of matrix functions  Using the semidefinite ordering (X \\\\preceq Y \\\\Leftrightarrow Y - X is positive-semidefinite and X \\\\prec Y \\\\Leftrightarrow Y - X is positive definite), some of the classes of scalar functions can be extended to matrix functions of Hermitian matrices.  Operator monotone  A function f is called operator monotone if and only if 0 \\\\prec A \\\\preceq H \\\\Rightarrow f(A) \\\\preceq f(H) for all self-adjoint matrices A,H with spectra in the domain of f. This is analogous to monotone function in the scalar case.  Operator concave/convex  A function f is called operator concave if and only if : \\\\tau f(A) + (1-\\\\tau) f(H) \\\\preceq f \\\\left ( \\\\tau A + (1-\\\\tau)H \\\\right ) for all self-adjoint matrices A,H with spectra in the domain of f and \\\\tau \\\\in [0,1]. This definition is analogous to a concave scalar function. An operator convex function can be defined be switching \\\\preceq to \\\\succeq in the definition above. Examples The matrix log is both operator monotone and operator concave. The matrix square is operator convex. The matrix exponential is none of these. Loewner's theorem states that a function on an open interval is operator monotone if and only if it has an analytic extension to the upper and lower complex half planes so that the upper half plane is mapped to itself.

The forces fought to gain control over the Oromo areas south of the Gibe River.Shinn, p. 67 The Gojjame forces under Tekle Haymanot were defeated. This is one of the three battles (along with Chelenqo and Adwa) which Donald Donham lists that led to Shewan supremacy over the rest of Ethiopia.Donald Donham, \\"Old Abyssinia and the new Ethiopian empire: themes in social history\\" in The Southern Marches of Imperial Ethiopia (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 23 Background South of Gojjam, across the Abay River, and southwest of Shewa, lay the fertile Gibe region and the gold deposits beyond. Both polities craved control of these resources in order to assert dominance over the rest of Ethiopia. Of the two, the Gojjame had the earlier start and better position: as early as 1810, a large volume of luxury trade passed North through Gojjam (and its major market at Boso) to the coast of the Red Sea, far more than passed east through Shewa to the coast. Negus Bofo of Limmu-Ennarea maintained good relations with the contemporary governor of Gojjam.Mohammed Hassen, The Oromo of Ethiopia: A History 1570–1860 (Trenton: Red Sea, 1994), pp. 133–138 A letter survives from his son Abba Bagibo to Dejazmach Goshu Zewde, seeking an alliance against a mutual foe.Mohammed Hassen, The Oromo, pp. 176–180 The armies of Shewa and Gojjam had clashed earlier in 1882. The Shewan was led by Ras Gobana Dacche, and the Gojjame by Ras Darrasu, a deputy of Negus Tekle Haymanot; Ras Gobana had forced his opponent to surrender the tribute he was bringing back to Tekle Haymanot. Humiliated, Tekle Haymanot exchanged angry words with his peer, Menelik II, which resulted with the two potentates leading their armies to face one another at Embabo near the Guder River.Harold G. Marcus, (1995). The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844–1913 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), p. 69 Battle The battle began at 10:00 am with the Gojjame cannons firing at the enemy. The guns of both sides did little damage, and soon were inoperable. After a volley of rifle fire, soldiers on both sides charged and engaged their opponents in what Harold Marcus describes as \\"a fierce day-long battle of hand-to-hand combat, with both kings participating as ordinary soldiers\\". Late in the afternoon the Gojjame center collapsed, and Tekle Haymanot was wounded then captured. The troops under his son, Ras Bezzabbeh, surrendered and were taken prisoner. Although Ras Darrasu continued to fight, a cavalry charge led by Ras Gobana on his flank ended their resistance, and the battle was over. More than half the Gojjame force was lost during the battle. The Shewans suffered 913 killed and 1,648 wounded.Shinn, p. 67 Aftermath \\"In victory Menelik was prepared to be magnanimous\\", Marcus states. Menelik allowed the common soldiers to return to their farms and plough their lands before the rainy season.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 70 For his vital role in the conflict, Menelik awarded Ras Gobana the governorship of the Gibe region, making the Ras potentially the most powerful man in Shewa—after Negus Menelik.Mohammed Hassen, The Oromo, p. 199 However, there was one exception to Menelik's magnanimity. According to Oromo tradition, Tekle Haymanot had been captured by a slave named Sambato, who did not know the identity of his prisoner. Ras Mangasha Atikam did recognize Sambato's prisoner, bought his captive for ten Maria Theresa thalers, and led him to Ras Gobana's tent. Gobana, on seeing the Negus, called to him in Amharic, \\"Gojjame, bring me the plate!\\" – responding to a boast Tekle Haymanot had made before the two armies had clashed: \\"After the battle Ras Gobana will carry my mitad [baking tray] back to Gojjam.\\" Sambato also received his freedom and was made a fitawrari for capturing the enemy negus.Enrico Cerulli, \\"The folk-literature of the Galla of Southern Abyssinia\\", Harvard African Studies, 3 (1922), p. 73 However, Emperor Yohannes IV, their overlord, was outraged at his two vassals openly at war with each other and marched to Were Ilu, just inside Menelik's borders, where he demanded the release of Tekle Haymanot and his family. There the Emperor hammered out a compromise: Yohannes would take Agawmeder from Negus Tekle Haymanot and Wollo from Negus Menelik; Menelik would surrender the arms he captured to Yohannes's lieutenant Ras Alula Engida; and a peace was cemented with several dynastic marriages, including Negus Menelik to the daughter of a noble family from the Emperor's own domain, Taitu Betul.Paul B.

Its primary targets included enemy gun positions, road junctions, traffic concentrations, assembly areas, bridges, and targets of opportunity.\\" \\"In August 1944 during the invasion of southern France, wing personnel, applying techniques developed in the invasion of Sicily and Italy, controlled air operations while aboard ships patrolling the assault beaches. With the landing of troops, a beachhead control unit directed aircraft to hit enemy strong points, ammunition dumps, troop concentrations, road intersections, supply lines, and communications. As Allied forces advanced northward along the Rhone valley, the wing implemented a plan to give more rapid support to the ground troops. Forward control units, equipped with the latest in air ground communications, directed sector air ground support. During the operations in France and Germany (1944–1945), the 64th continued to coordinate the close air-ground support of its fighter aircraft.\\" After the end of hostilities in May 1945, the wing served in the occupation of Germany as part of the XII Tactical Air Command, United States Air Forces in Europe. In Occupied Germany the wing performed many occupation duties such as destroying captured enemy aircraft, repairing roads, bridges and processing Prisoners of War. It also commanded combat units which were inactivating and sending their aircraft to storage, disposal or return to the United States. It was inactivated in Germany on 5 June 1947. Cold War 64th Air Division Area of Responsibility Reactivated as an Air Division under Northeast Air Command (NEAC) at Pepperrell Air Force Base, Newfoundland in December 1952. NEAC had taken over the former Newfoundland Base Command atmospheric forces and ground air and radar stations in Newfoundland, Northeastern Canada and Greenland upon the former command's inactivation. The 64th Air Division was NEAC's command and control echelon of command over these assets. \\"Its mission was the administration, training and providing air defense combat ready forces within its designated geographic area of responsibility, exercising command jurisdiction over its assigned units, installations, and facilities. In addition, the division and its subordinate units under its control participated in numerous exercises. NEAC was inactivated in April 1957, and its air defense mission was reassigned to Air Defense Command (ADC). The 64th continued its operations under ADC at Pepperrell including the operational control of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) and Air Forces Iceland. In January 1960, it activated the Goose Air Defense Sector (Manual) at Goose Air Force Base. On 26 May 1960, the division headquarters moved from Newfoundland to Stewart Air Force Base, New York, when part of its mission was taken over by the 26th Air Division (SAGE) in a realignment of forces. At Stewart it assumed the mission of training and providing air defense combat ready forces for the aerospace defense of a 6,000,000 square miles (16,000,000 km2) region of North America, including New Jersey, New York, New England north of Massachusetts, Eastern Canada, and atmospheric forces in Greenland. The Division was inactivated in July 1963 with the phasedown of ADC at Stewart, its mission being taken over by First Air Force.

Written in 1897, it is a response to Edgar Allan Poe's 1838 novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. It follows the adventures of the narrator and his journey from the Kerguelen Islands aboard Halbrane. Neither Poe nor Verne had actually visited the remote Kerguelen Islands, located in the south Indian Ocean,Kauffmann, Jean-Paul The Arch of Kerguelen: Voyage to the Islands of Desolation Translated by Patricia Clancy. Edinburgh. Four Walls Eight Windows (November 5, 2000) but their works are some of the few literary (as opposed to exploratory) references to the archipelago. Plot Map of Antarctic region, according to Verne  Volume 1  The story is set in 1839, eleven years after the events in Arthur Gordon Pym, one year after the publication of that book. The narrator is a wealthy American Jeorling, who has entertained himself with private studies of the wildlife on the Kerguelen Islands and is now looking for a passage back to the United States. Halbrane is one of the first ships to arrive at Kerguelen, and its captain Len Guy somewhat reluctantly agrees to have Jeorling as a passenger as far as Tristan da Cunha. Underway, they meet a stray iceberg with a dead body on it, which turns out to be a sailor from Jane. A note found with him indicates that he and several others including Jane's captain William Guy had survived the assassination attempt at Tsalal and are still alive. Guy, who had talked to Jeorling earlier about the subject of Pym, reveals himself to be the brother of William Guy. He decides to try to come to the rescue of Janes crew. After taking on provisions on Tristan da Cunha and the Falklands, they head South with Jeorling still on board. They also take aboard another mysterious sailor named Hunt who is eager to join the search for undisclosed reasons. Extraordinarily mild weather allows the Halbrane to make good progress, and they break the pack ice barrier, which surrounds an ice-free Antarctic ocean, early in summer. They find first Bennet's islet, where Jane had made a stop, and finally Tsalal. But the island is completely devastated, apparently by a recent massive earthquake, and deserted. They find the remains of Tsalal's natives, who apparently died long before the earthquake, and the collar of Pym's dog, Tiger, but no trace of Jane.  Volume 2  At this point, Hunt is revealed to be Dirk Peters. On their travel south of Tsalal, he and Pym had become separated, and only Peters made it safely back to the States where he, not Pym, instigated the publication of their voyage. Pym's diary, in Peters' possession, had apparently been significantly embellished by Poe. Upon returning home, Peters took on a new identity, because he was too ashamed of having resorted to cannibalism on the wreck of Grampus. Guy and Peters decide to push further south, much to the chagrin of a part of the crew led by one seaman Hearne, who feels they should abandon the rescue attempt and head home before the onset of winter. The wreck of the Halbrane Not much later, in a freak accident, Halbrane is thrown upon an iceberg and subsequently lost. The crew makes it safely onto the iceberg, but with only one small boat left, it is doomed to drift on. The iceberg drifts even past the South Pole, before the whole party is cast ashore on a hitherto unknown land mass still within the pack ice barrier. Hearne and his fellows steal the last remaining boat, trying to make it to the open sea on their own, and making the situation even bleaker for those left behind who now face the prospect of wintering in the Antarctic. They are lucky, however, as shortly thereafter they see a small boat of aboriginal style drifting by. Peters is the first to react as he swims out toward the boat and secures it. But Peters finds more: In the boat, there are captain William Guy and the three surviving seamen of his crew, semiconscious and close to death by starvation. Peters brings them ashore, and the men from Halbrane nurse them back to life. William Guy then recounts their story. Shortly after the explosion of Jane (and presumably the departure of Pym's company), Tiger appeared again. Rabid, he bit and infected the natives who quickly fell victim to the new disease. Those who could fled to the neighboring islands, where they perished later in the course of the earthquake. Up to this point, William Guy and his men had lived fairly comfortably on Tsalal, which was now their own, but after the earthquake found their position untenable and made a desperate attempt in the boat to escape north. The Sphinx The combined crews of Halbrane and Jane decide to try to make it north in their newly acquired boat. They make good progress, until they notice the appearance of strong magnetic forces. They find the source of it, the Ice Sphinx: A huge mountain magnetically \\"charged\\" by the particle streams that get focused on the poles through Earth's magnetic field. Here, they find the remains of Hearne's team, which came to grief when the Ice Sphinx's immense magnetic forces attracted their iron tools and boat components to it and smashed them on its rocks. The boat of Joerling and the others only escaped destruction because, being built by the natives, it contained no iron parts. At the foot of the Sphinx, they also find the body of Pym, who came to death the same way. Peters dies from grief on the same spot. The others embark again in their boat, and finally reach the open ocean and are rescued.

The two are connected by an arcade that spans the boardwalk, and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and Bradley Park on the west. A statue of Asbury Park founder James A. Bradley faces the buildings west facade. The theatre has undergone recent renovations by Landmark Studio of Pittstown.  History  In 1916, Asbury Park Mayor Clarence E.F. Hetrick hired famed architectural firm McKim, Mead and White to design a convention center for the block just north of the city's Atlantic Square, between 6th and Sunset Avenues. The firm submitted a plan that called for a 5000-seat venue costing $75,000 to construct. However, city founder James A. Bradley owned the block in question, then home to the aging Asbury Park Auditorium, and refused to sell the plot to the city. After Bradley's death in 1921, department store scion Arthur Steinbach purchased the Auditorium property from Bradley's estate, demolished the auditorium, and constructed the Berkeley-Carteret Hotel on the plot. Asbury Park Grand Arcade between Paramount Theatre and Convention Hall. The completion of the third Madison Square Garden in New York, and the approval of Atlantic City's new Convention Hall, put Hetrick under considerable pressure to construct a similar venue for Asbury Park. \\"While we have hesitated, Atlantic City has added $100,000,000 in valuations,\\" he told the Asbury Park Press. \\"While the Traymores and Breakers and other imposing structures have been built over a period of 25 years, we can show only the Monterey, the Berkeley-Carteret, the Asbury-Carlton and the Palace (referring to four then-new seasonal hotels in the resort city).\\" In 1927, after a mysterious fire destroyed the 5th Avenue Arcade just east of Atlantic Square on the Boardwalk, voters passed a bond referendum to construct a new convention center on the plot. Hetrick commissioned architects Warren and Wetmore, whose eventual design called for a 1600-seat theatre to occupy the old 5th Avenue Arcade plot. The theatre was connected to an enclosed arcade that covered the boardwalk. This arcade was connected on the east to a 3200-seat convention center. The entire complex was designed in a combination Italian-French style, with an emphasis on nautical themes in recognition of its oceanfront location. The interior of the theatre was dominated by gold, black, and purple, and featured a giant rosette on the ceiling. Walter Reade, who owned four other theatres in Asbury Park, initially protested the new theatre's construction, saying five theaters were one too many for the town. However, just prior to the theatre's completion, he was given the contract to book movies at the venue. As part of a deal Reade brokered with film distributor Paramount-Famous Players-Lasky, the new theatre was named the Paramount Theatre. Paramount Theatre Facade Reade inaugurated cinema at the theatre with a showing of the 1927 film Wings on New Year's Day, 1930. However, he decided to hold a much more spectacular \\"grand opening\\" of the theatre on July 11, 1930, with a second showing of Wings. In attendance were Wings leading man Charles \\"Buddy\\" Rogers, the Marx Brothers, Ginger Rogers, Ed Wynn, Fredric March, and Carole Lombard.Pike, Helen-Chantal (2005). Asbury Park's Glory Days: The Story of an American Resort. Rutgers University Press, pp. 55-61 The theatre featured a mix of movies and live performances from 1930 into the 1980s. The 1,600-seat theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Premier Theatre Company was the resident theatre company for the Paramount Theatre from 2007 - 2015. Premier has been honored by The United States House of Representatives, New Jersey State Senate and Assembly, The City of Asbury Park, and The Asbury Park Chamber of Commerce for their contributions to the revitalization of the City of Asbury Park. The theater is also the site for the annual Holy Cross celebration, hosted by the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of New Jersey. The divine liturgy services are held inside the theater, given by all the priests in every single New Jersey Greek Orthodox Church.

Influential and long debated, the volume is often compared for its impact in its field with Charles Darwin's 1859 work, On the Origin of Species. First published as Geschichte Israels (\\"History of Israel\\") in 1878, the work had a second edition in 1883 under the title Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels. The official English translation by J. Sutherland Black and Allan Menzies, with a preface by Wellhausen's friend and colleague the no less prominent British biblical scholar and orientalist William Robertson Smith, then came in 1885. Between the original publication and the translation, Wellhausen composed an 1881 article - originally called \\"Jewish History\\" but published as \\"Israel\\" - for Smith's ninth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, a piece published repeatedly in English and in German. Although Wellhausen originally intended the Prolegomena as the first part of a two-volume work on the history of Israel and ancient Judaism, the second volume did not appear until 1894, as Israelitische und jüdische Geschichte. Background (All references are to the Project Gutenberg e-text of Wellhausen's \\"Prolegomena\\") The subject of the Prolegomena is the origins of the Pentateuch. It reviews all the major advances of the preceding century by Johann Gottfried Eichhorn, Wilhelm de Wette, Karl Heinrich Graf, Kuenen, Noldeke, Colenso and others, and puts forward the author's view, which is that the Priestly source was the last of the four sources, written during the Babylonian exile c.550 BC. The implication to be drawn from this was that the Mosaic Law contained in Leviticus, which is largely by the Priestly author, as well as the substantial amounts of material from the Priestly source to be found in Genesis, Exodus and the Book of Numbers, did not exist in the age of Joshua, Samuel, David and Solomon.  Summary  The book consists of an author's Introduction and three major sections. Its argument is that the ancient Israelites did not practice a religion recognisable as Judaism: the earliest religion of the Israelites, as depicted in the Yahwist and Elohist sources, was polytheistic and family-based. The middle layer, the Deuteronomist, shows a clear impulse to the centralisation of worship under the control of a dominant priesthood with royal support. Only in the final, post-Exilic, layer, the Priestly source, when the royal authority has vanished and the priesthood has assumed sole authority over the community, is there evidence of the religion that the world knows as Judaism.  Introduction  Wellhausen announces his intention to demonstrate the hypothesis of Karl Heinrich Graf that the Law is later than the Prophets: that the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy (the torah, or \\"law\\", as they are known to the Jewish tradition and immediately precede the history of Israel making up the series from Joshua to Kings, the \\"prophets\\", called because they were thought to have been written by the prophet Samuel and others, but they were in fact written after those books). He then sets out some commonly agreed ground: :1. The Pentateuch plus the book of Joshua make up a literary unit of six books, or Hexateuch, tracing the history of the Israelites from the Patriarchal age to the conquest of Canaan; and :2. This hexateuch draws on three sources, the combined Yahwist/Elohist, which consists largely of narratives and dates from the period prior to the destruction of the kingdom of Israel (c.722 BC); the Deuteronomist, responsible for the book of Deuteronomy and dating from the reign of Josiah (c. 620 BC); and the Priestly source, made up largely of the law-code of Leviticus but with connections to all the other books except Deuteronomy. Wellhausen proposes to fix the dates of each of the sources, especially of the Priestly source, \\"by reference to an independent standard, namely, the inner development of the history of Israel so far as that is known to us by trustworthy testimonies, from independent sources.\\"  History of worship  Each of the sources (Yahwist/Elohist, Deuteronomist and Priestly) reflects a different stage in evolution of religious practice in ancient Israel. Thus, to take one of the five elements of this practice, the Yahwist/Elohist \\"sanctions a multiplicity of altars\\", allowing sacrifice at any place; the Deuteronomist records the moment in history (the reform of Josiah, c.620 BC), when a single place of worship was demanded by both priesthood and king; and the Priestly law-code does not demand, but presupposes, centralised worship. In the same way, the other elements of ancient Israelite religion (sacrifice, sacred feasts, the position of the priests and Levites, and the \\"endowment of the clergy\\", tithes due to the priests and Levites) have a radically different form in the Yahwist/Elohist to that in the Priestly source, with Deuteronomy occupying an intermediate position. The Priestly source consistently attempts to disguise what are in fact innovations with a veneer of antiquity by inventing, for example, a fictional Tabernacle not mentioned anywhere in the oldest sources, to justify its insistence on centralised worship in Jerusalem. \\"What is brought forward in Deuteronomy as an innovation is assumed in the Priestly Code to be an ancient custom dating as far back as to Noah.\\"  History of tradition  The history of the traditions of Israel, like the history of worship, shows a steady progression from the epic and prophetic age of the Yahwist and the Elohist, to the law-bound world of the Priestly source, with Deuteronomy acting as the bridge. \\"In Chronicles the past is remodelled on the basis of the Law: transgressions take place now and then, but as exceptions from the rule. In the Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings, the fact of the radical difference of the old practice from the Law is not disputed [but] is simply condemned. In the Chronicles the pattern according to which the history of ancient Israel is represented is the Pentateuch, i.e. the Priestly Code.... [I]n the older historical books, the revision does not proceed upon the basis of the Priestly Code, which indeed is completely unknown to them, but on the basis of Deuteronomy. Thus in the question of the order of sequence of the two great bodies of laws, the history of the tradition leads us to the same conclusion as the history of the cultus.\\"  Israel and Judaism  In his concluding section Wellhausen restates his argument that the Priestly source is the last to appear, postdating the Deuteronomist. He summarises also his further conclusions: *There was no written law in ancient Israel, the Torah being held as an oral tradition by priests and prophets. *Deuteronomy was the first law and gained currency only during the Babylonian exile, when the prophetic tradition ceased. *Ezekiel and his successors were responsible for the codification and systematisation of worship and Ezra for the introduction of the Priestly code (the laws contained in Leviticus). *It was that creation of a written Torah which marked the break between the ancient history of Israel and the later history of Judaism.

It was used to print Technicolor films, as well as to produce paper colour prints used in advertising, or large transparencies for display. History The use of dye imbibition for making full-color prints from a set of black-and-white photographs taken through different color filters was first proposed and patented by Charles Cros in 1880.Pénichon, Sylvie (2013). \\"Twentieth-Century Color Photographs: Identification and Care\\". The Getty Conservation Institute, Los Angeles. pp. 127-131. It was commercialized by Edward Sanger-Shepherd, who in 1900 was marketing kits for making color prints on paper and slides for projection. Imbibition printing was initially in monochrome. The basic underlying principle is that bichromate development of a silver gelatine photographic emulsion (not strictly a real chemical emulsion) results in the gelatine being differentially tanned or hardened in proportion to the exposure received, and blackening obtained. When washed in hot water a relief gelatine image is obtained which is then immersed in a dye bath, washed off in a 3% acetic acid solution (one liter for a 16 x 20 inch print to remove excess dye) then to the 1% acetic acid holding bath. Photographic paper was removed from the conditioner (mordant bath) and matrix was rolled into contact with photographic paper consisting of a paper base, a baryta coating to improve light reflectance and a gelatine coating without the light sensitive silver salts in regular photographic bromide paper. The gelatine absorbs dye from the matrix (which is the same size as the print). Finally, the print is dried between blotters, or by heat. The colour process depends on superimposing three images in the subtractive colours: cyan, magenta and yellow in exact register, facilitated by means of register pins mounted at the edge of a glass rolling bed, using a purpose designed punch to make holes at the edge of the matrix films. As three matrices are required for each print, which are the same size as the print, the process is relatively expensive. Colour separation negatives together with their high contrast highlight masks that keep specular highlights clear from fogging over by exposing the contrast reducing masks through them. Technicolor introduced dye transfer in its Process 3, introduced in the feature film The Viking (1928), which was produced by the Technicolor Corporation and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Technicolor's two previous systems were an additive color process and a physically problematic subtractive color process, the latter requiring two prints cemented together back-to-back. Process 3 used an imbibition process pioneered by the Handschiegl color process, which had been created in 1916 for Cecil B. DeMille's feature film Joan the Woman (1917). Technicolor further refined the imbibition dye transfer process in its Process 4, introduced in 1932, which employed three simultaneously filmed negatives.Technicolor entry at Widescreen Museum In the 1940s, this process was popularized by the work of Jeannette Klute at Eastman Kodak for general-purpose graphic arts work, but not for motion picture work, which remained exclusive to Technicolor (and for which Eastman Kodak was manufacturing Technicolor's light-sensitive camera and printing films, including the \\"blank receiver\\" film, on an exclusive basis, but not Technicolor's dyes), and is sometimes referred to by such generic names as \\"wash-off relief printing\\" and \\"dye imbibition\\" printing. The graphic arts process requires making three printing matrices from three colour separation negatives made from a colour transparency original or at one time directly in a large format camera fitted with a sliding plate holder or film holder (to minimize camera movement when changing regular plate holders). The matrices, which are relief gelatine images on a film support (one for each subtractive primary color) absorb dye in proportion to the optical densities of the gelatin relief image. Successive placement of the dyed film matrices, one at a time, \\"transfers\\" each primary dye by physical contact from the matrix to a mordanted, gelatin-coated paper. It took a technician one whole day to produce one print. Firstly, three colour separation negatives were made using three high contrast highlight masks to produce three contrast reducing and colour correction unsharp masks. The unsharp masks were made with an oblique light source (and a clear film as a spacer, the contact frame exposed while rotating on a gramaphone turntable. The original was either a miniature 6 x 6 cm or 35 mmm colour transparency, or else a large format 5 x 7 or 8 x 10 inch colour transparency Three separation negatives were made on panchromatic film exposing the colour transparency through a red, green and blue filter that would eventually print in the subtractive dyes: cyan, magenta and yellow respectively. The red separation negative was exposed onto panchromatic film through the red unsharp mask. The green separation negative was also exposed through the red unsharp mask. The blue separation negative was exposed through the green unsharp mask. The purpose of the contrast reducing masks was to reduce the contrast range of the original transparencies to a level that could be handled by reflected copy material. By swapping the masks, colour correction was achieved to compensate for deficiencies in the dyes. The 8 x 10 separation negatives were placed in an enlarger to expose the printing matrices. These were developed in plastic developing trays, and when fixed were washed in hot water to remove unexposed gelatin. After drying in a room with a fan heater each matrix was placed in a dye bath: the red matrix in cyan; the green matrix in magenta, and the blue matrix in yellow Dye. Before being rolled into contact with the mordanted paper with a gelatine surface, the first matrix was lifted out of the cyan Dye Bath and allowed to drain until the stream of dye broke into drops. It was then placed into a plastic developing dish and one litre of 3% acetic acid. The dish was vigorously rocked back and forth and right to left from side to side to wash off the Dye on the surface of the matrix. The matrix was lifted clear of the solution once so as to allow the acetic acid solution to reach the back of the matrix film. To facilitate registration, a special punch with pairs of matching register pins: one round on the left and a squarish pin on the right; both pins mounted at the edge of a glass rolling bed. The paper was placed on the glass rolling bed gelatine surface up. The matrix held by one short edge high in the air while the left (round) hole fitted onto the register pin, and then the right (squarish) hole pressed down onto the pin. Then a rubber roller is taken and the matrix firmly rolled away from the operator into contact with the paper which is kept in a pile in a conditioning bath. The dye is absorbed by the paper for one minute after which the matrix is picked up by the farthermost corners and peeled off the paper. The same procedure is followed for the magenta and yellow matrices. Status today In 1994, Eastman Kodak stopped making all materials for this process. The dyes used in the process are very spectrally pure compared to normal coupler-induced photographic dyes, with the exception of the Kodak cyan. The dyes have excellent light and dark fastness. The dye transfer process possesses a larger color gamut and tonal scale than any other process, including inkjet. Another important characteristic of dye transfer is that it allows the practitioner the highest degree of photographic control compared to any other photochemical color print process. A peculiar advantage of the process was that skilled Dye Transfer retouchers would use the same dyes the image was printed with to fill in blank white spaces between two or three separate colour photographs such as a background shot (rocks and a waterfall) one or more human figures, and more often than not a product shot (a cigarette pack) to produce a \\"strip in\\". Using the same dyes for photographically printing the images and for retouching meant that colour matching by eye would not show up differently when rephotographed.

Architecture  The house has a floor area of 3.05 by 1.8 metres (10.0 by 5.9 ft) and is painted red. It stands near the Conwy Castle walls. The ground floor is devoted to the living area with room for coal and an open fire, and a water tap tucked behind the stairs. The upstairs holds the cramped bedroom, which also comes with a small niche for storage.  Tourism  Tours of the house occur daily. Admission is £1.00 for adults or 50p for children; there is information about the house inside. A Welsh lady in traditional clothing stands outside when the house is open and will tell visitors about the history of the house. Visitors are unable to go upstairs to the first floor, due to structural instability, but can view it from the step ladder. It is open from spring to autumn.

It is situated about 15 miles north of Georgetown, Texas and about 38 miles north of Austin. According to the 2000 census, the population was 25; it was 25 in the 2005 census estimate. History Also called Berry's Creek and Stapp, Andice is located at the intersection of Farm Roads 2338 and 970, five miles southwest of Florence in northwest Williamson County. The site was first settled by Joshua Stapp, who built a log structure to serve as a school and church in 1857. In 1876 Andrew Jackson, the proprietor of a small store on Berry Creek near the site of the future town, was appointed postmaster of the Berry's Creek post office, which continued in operation until 1879. Andice's name dates back to 1899 when Rev. William Isaac Newton applied for a new post office to be named after his newborn son, Audice. Postal officials misread the name as \\"Andice\\" and approved that name. Today, the common pronunciation of the town name is \\"an-dice\\". Taking the name's origin into consideration, the correct pronunciation is \\"an-diss\\". The latter is the pronunciation used by older, native residents, but is rare amongst younger generations and recent implants to the area.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hna34 Geography Andice is located at geographical coordinates (30.781940, -97.851940). Education The Town of Andice is served by the Florence Independent School District. When the town's schoolhouse was active, into the 1960s, its mascot was the Owls.

The station was licensed to operate at 1330 kHz, with a daytime power of 5,000 watts, and a nighttime power of 35 watts. The station had been owned by Results Radio Company. History: beginnings as WADJ WBHV made its debut in the spring of 1981 as WADJ, owned by Johnstown radio and television legend Ron Lorence, known best to WJAC-TV audiences as the host of such popular locally-produced programs such as \\"Seniors Today\\" and \\"Scholastic Squares\\". Lorence was also known for many years (and still is today) as the voice of Pennsylvania's Allied Milk Producers' radio commercials. WADJ was first granted its license in December 1980, doing business as Nor-Lin Broadcasters, building a new two-tower directional antenna array at Cannell Drive on the outskirts of Somerset, which would also house the station's studios and general offices. It began operations as a sunrise to sunset only operation, but managed to compete well with its well-established and more powerful crosstown competitor, WVSC (now WNTI), which had gone on the air many years before. WADJ was very much a family business, with Lorence managing the station and overseeing all aspects of programming, while his wife Norma oversaw the sales department. When their son Brad came of age, he gradually assumed the programming duties from his father. In 1988, Nor-Lin Broadcasters purchased WYSN (now WCCL), adding an FM station, known as Sunny 101.7, to its portfolio. It was also in this same year that WADJ was granted 24-hour broadcasting rights, allowing it to remain on the air at 35 watts after sunset. WADJ, which had been an adult contemporary and talk formatted station, would then assume the WYSN calls and format in March 1997, following the switch of WYSN-FM from adult standards to adult contemporary music and the assumption of the call sign WSRA. WADJ at this time became known as \\"Sunny 1330\\" to retain its loyal FM listener base for this niche format. The decision had been made by Nor-Lin to go through with the format switch after WVSC-AM-FM had been sold to Forever Broadcasting and the FM station dropping its heritage adult contemporary format (mostly automated) for contemporary country music. Though both stations demonstrated long-term profitability for Nor-Lin Broadcasters, the Lorence Family decided to sell WYSN and WRSA to Dame Media, which had owned radio properties in Johnstown since 1990, in December 2000. At Dame's request, Ron Lorence stayed on as General Manager, primarily to assist with the transfer of ownership. Lorence decided it was time to retire and stepped down in 2002. Brad Lorence stayed on, taking many of his father's former duties and remained a part of the station, including that as morning show host on WRSA (which became WCCL in 2001 and adopted an oldies format). Brad Lorence and morning show co-host Jessica Taylor were abruptly fired in 2004, prompting an angry response by many Johnstown area radio listeners and a front page story in the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat. By this time, the station's longtime studio location at Cannell Drive was later moved to Dame's other properties in Johnstown. The following year, Dame Media decided to get out of the radio business in Johnstown to concentrate on their other broadcast interests in central and eastern Pennsylvania. The stations of the former Nor- Lin Broadcasters were then sold in March 2005 to Results Radio - 2510 Licenses, LLC, which also purchased Nor-Lin's former competitors in Somerset. Shortly after the purchase, WYSN's call letters were changed to WBHV. End of WBHV Following the purchase of the new WBHV, the station dropped its southern gospel programming and picked up the simulcast of Johnstown affiliate ESPN Radio station WPRR. Programming was then moved to studios in Johnstown. On May 11, 2011 WBHV went silent, formally surrendering its license to the FCC in a letter dated August 1, 2011, citing the loss of its transmitter site as the reason. Since then the two-tower array has been demolished and the transmitter has been relocated to WLLI in Somerset as a backup.

Originally \\"Shannon Mall\\", it opened in 1980 and initially thrived until the 1990s when growth in neighboring cities drew shoppers away from the mall. After new ownership and renovations in 2006, the name was changed from \\"Shannon Mall\\" to \\"Union Station Mall\\" in 2006. After many years of decline, the mall closed in November 2010, and demolition began in late October 2014 to make way for a movie studio. History The mall opened on August 7, 1980 as Shannon Mall with anchor stores Sears, Rich's, and Davison's. It was renovated in 1986, 1999, and 2006. In 1987, the mall became \\"Shannon Southpark Mall\\" - but was changed back to \\"Shannon Mall\\" after its renovation in 1999 due to the fact that 38% of people in a survey claimed to still use that name. In 2006, the mall was again renamed - this time as \\"Union Station Mall.\\" In 1986, the mall was renovated by adding a new wing that Mervyn's occupied. In the early 1990s, under new management, the mall began a slight decline as less money was spent on advertising while some of the anchors cut back on inventory. In 1996, after the nearby Fayette Pavilion opened, some stores including Linens 'n Things and Toys \\"R\\" Us left the mall. In January 1997 Mervyn's announced its plans to close and JCPenney began operating in the Mervyn's wing in October. In March 1998, Macy's moved out of the former Davison's building which would remain unoccupied for the duration of the mall's operation. In 1999, the mall underwent a $10 million renovation which saw the floor replaced with Italian tile, an enhanced ceiling, new benches with softer seating, a new look to the three main entrances with a lighter color scheme, removal of the food court's elevated seating area and a downgrade in the size of the mall's central fountain. In 2000, the decline continued as JCPenney left the mall and the Mervyn's wing lost so many tenants that management required the remaining ones to move elsewhere in the mall. The wing was blocked from late 2004 until late 2006. While not in use, the wing was required by Union City to have a functional fire escape door near the boarded up wall leading to the mall's entrance/exit within that wing for emergencies. In 2006, the Mervyn's wing became an entertainment complex named Maxx-Fun. Maxx-Fun had plans to take over the entire wing by adding a bowling alley, a comedy club, and other entertainment venues in the vacant store fronts. Shortly after construction began it was abruptly halted when one of the investors died. The mall's owner, Lee Najjir, was an investor himself and no longer desired to participate in the deal. Maxx-Fun operated until fall 2009 before leaving the mall with two vacant anchors again. The mall (during the tenure of Orlando Allen) sought to reopen Maxx-Fun and sought entertainment-based tenants for the former Macy's building. Several firms showed interest in it, but no one moved beyond initial conversations. Also, Maxx-Fun had a website in summer 2010 announcing its return to Union Station Mall. However, its fixtures and signs were removed from the property at some point afterwards, and its website is no longer functioning. Notable features The mall had skylights that provided natural light inside the mall, bright corridors, and a large sun window in the food court. Also, prior to the mall's renovation in 1999, there was a rise in the food court. There was also a water fountain in the middle of the mall, which was a smaller version of one that previously existed. Also, while most of the mall had only one floor, the former Macy's building was the only part that had two floors. Additionally, near the food court main entrance, a large multi- monitor display once existed - showing mall-related advertisements. Prior to the mall's closing, there were plans to create \\"Mall TV\\" to provide original programming for mall patrons. In one wing, there existed a large metal sculpture of a clown on a unicycle - animated and positioned below one of the ceiling skylights. The sculpture was eventually removed after many complaints of the decay of the statue. Competition The mall suffered several blows that stymied its potential. Shannon Tower, the office building that sits behind the former mall, was the pilot of several similar office structures planned. The tower, according to Bull Realty, opened in 1978 - two years before the mall. Woody Johnson, the leasing consultant for the property, stated that the late developer, Scott Hudgins (who also developed the mall), wanted to build office complexes behind the mall. The demand for such never materialized, and the parcels remained naturally wooded. The office developments were supposed to provide constant foot traffic for the mall. In 1996, the Fayette Pavilion opened - taking Linens 'n Things, Toys \\"R\\" Us, and several other tenants away from the mall. The Fayette Pavilion was supposed to be another enclosed mall for the south side, but city and county zoning laws prohibited such. In 1998, Macy's closed its original location in the former Davison's building. Arbor Place Mall opened in 1999 - pulling the Douglas County shoppers away from the mall, and several other stores were lured away from the mall. In 2003, Camp Creek Marketplace opened on Camp Creek, and while some retailers had locations in both Camp Creek and Shannon Mall, the Shannon locations were closed by late 2004. The proposed mall in Newnan became Ashley Park - an open-air shopping center that featured restaurants and retailers such as Belk and Dillard's. This development had always been on the radar as a threat to Shannon since the 1990s, as it was like other planned malls in the metro area. Ashley Park, by some experts, took potential tenants who would have probably set up shop in Shannon Mall. Greenbriar Mall, the mall that Shannon was giving a run for its money, even lured tenants away from the area when the mall was dying. Other barriers to growth Some real estate scholars have argued that the area was never suited for the proposed potential of the mall. The demographics of the South Fulton cities such as Union City, Palmetto, and Fairburn were not strong enough to support such. The mall relied heavily on being regional - pulling people from Coweta County, Douglas County, Fayette County, Camp Creek, Cascade, Southwest Atlanta, and airport travelers. As more developments opened, fewer people came back to Shannon Mall. It failed to attract sit-down eateries beyond a Cracker Barrel (which closed prior to the mall's closing) and Buffalo's Cafe (which opened and closed in 2002). Gladys Knight's Chicken and Waffles looked into opening up a store in the mall but chose to be near the bowling alley instead. As even an undercover vote of no confidence in the mall, Union City focused more on the annexations of South Fulton Parkway and building up the industrial community on Oakley Industrial Boulevard. Final attempts to survive By 2006, the mall was struggling to keep the few major retailers it had left. Many were staples from the mall's heyday. As the more major names left, the numbers were dwindling. Some of the vacant spots were filled by independent and startup retailers, but many of them ultimately left due to the lack of business. In 2009, according to an interview of Maria Allen (former Marketing Director) in Home Rule News, the mall had only 32 stores left (including the big-box anchors). The mall offered incentives such as free rent for a period to lure businesses back into the mall. Event planners were given the use of the mall corridors to hold events to draw in potential shoppers. However, no major corporations bit. Event planners hit snags, as Union City required permits and variances, as the mall was not zoned for assembly usage. Some events such as an En Vogue concert, the annual Union City Mayor's Race, and Race Against Cancer did draw numbers. However, few people actually went inside the mall. Prior to the mall's closing, there were plans to create \\"Mall TV\\" to provide original programming for mall patrons. In addition, several firms were brought in to provide entertainment for mall patrons such as live radio broadcasting, stage plays, town hall meetings, fashion shows, and others. These events brought small numbers and some attention - but not enough to sustain the mall. In 2010, Chick-fil-A closed, being the only original tenant left from the mall's 1980 opening. Closure and redevelopment Due to the mall's owner, Lee Najjar, not paying the power bill, Georgia Power shut off electricity to the mall on November 2, 2010 at 10:30 p.m. after tenants were warned. Macy's and Sears, however, remained open since they had their own electric meters. However, although they initially stayed open after the mall's closure, Macy's announced in January 2011 its plans to leave. Sears, the last open store at the mall, remained open for several more months until finally announcing in August 2011 its plans to leave later in the year. By January 3, 2011, the foreclosed mall remained closed, and was auctioned at the Fulton County Courthouse the following day. The mall was purchased by Colonial Capital, a California investment company. Afterwards, the mall was placed back on the market for sale. According to Home Rule News, no buyers had shown interest in the property by May 2011. In February 2014, the mall was sold to RookerCo, and on October 27, 2014, a demolition ceremony at the site of the former mall took place in order to make way for a Film and Television production facility as well as a distribution center. In early 2016 the Atlanta Metro Studios opened for business on the site of the former Shannon Mall. Atlanta Metro Studios has the two largest purpose-built sound stages in North America. The largest purpose-built stage is 80,000 square feet with a 40' clear height. The second largest purpose-built stage is 55,000 square feet with 40' clear height. Because of the unique configuration of these two enormous stages, they can be subdivided into smaller stages by closing multiple operable sound-proof walls. There is the ability to have as many as 6 smaller stages at one time: (4) 20,000 sq ft and (2) 27,500 sq ft.

The term was coined by Blechner in his book The Dream Frontier. Interobjects differ from typical dream condensations in which two objects are fused into one. Instead the condensation is incomplete. Some examples from the literature on dreams include \\"a piece of hardware, something like the lock of a door or perhaps a pair of paint-frozen hinges,\\"Hobson, J.A. (1988) The Dreaming Brain. New York: Basic Books. and \\"something between a record-player and a balance scale.\\"Meltzer, D. (1984) Dream-Life. Perthshire, UK: Clunie Press. Interobjects are new creations derived from partially fused blends of other objects. Interobjects, like disjunctive cognitions, would sound bizarre or psychotic as perceptions in waking life, but are accepted by most people as commonplace in dreams. They have implications for both the theory of dreaming and the theory of categorization. Interobjects show the dreaming mind grouping items together whose connection may not be apparent to the waking mind. \\"Something between an aqueduct or a swimming-pool\\" reveals the category of \\"large man-made architectural objects that contain water.\\" \\"Something between a cellphone and a baby\\" reveals a category combining a relatively new piece of technology and a live infant: both make noise when you don't expect it, both are held close to your body, and both can give you a feeling of connectedness. Scientists do not know if interobjects occur only in dreamlife or may occur as unconscious categorizations during waking life. FreudFreud, S. (1900) The Interpretation of Dreams. New York: Viking. called interobjects \\"intermediate and composite structures.\\" He thought they were inferior mental constructions and were scrupulously avoided in waking life. Most adults tend to regularize interobjects when discussing them in waking life. Children are better able to sustain interobjects in their original form. A child told his father a dream in which he was in trouble at sea and \\"a seal swam up to them. They thought it was just a seal, but then they looked and under the water it was a whole boat, it was huge, so they climbed onto the seal/boat, and it brought them to the shore of the mainland.\\" When the boy told his father the dream in the morning, the father, speaking like an adult who cannot tolerate contradictions, said to him: \\"So really, it was a boat, a big, safe boat.\\" The child, holding fast to the integrity of his dream, said, \\"It was a boat, but it was still a big, friendly seal.\\" This child had not yet learned to regularize his perceptions to fit the way the world works. Adults may learn to reject interobjects in waking life, but still retain them in their dreams. Interobjects may have an elementary function in human thought. By transgressing the normal mental categories described by Eleanor Rosch, interobjects may be the origin of new ideas that would be harder to come by using only fully formed, secondary process formations. They may be one example of \\"Oneiric Darwinism\\"Blechner, M. (2001) The Dream Frontier. Hillsdale, NJ: The Analytic Press. in which new thought-mutations are created during dream-life and rejected or retained in waking life depending on their usefulness. Jung Jung, C. G. (1907/1960) The psychology of dementia praecox. (R. Hull, Trans.) In C. G. Jung, ' 'Collected Works' ' (Vol. 3, pp. 1–15). New York, NY: Pantheon. held that if the dreamer walked about and acted like a person awake, we would have the clinical picture of schizophrenia. Hobson Hobson, J. A. (1997) Dreaming as delirium: A mental status analysis of our nightly madness. ' 'Seminars in Neurology' ', 17, 121–128. concluded that dreams are more like delirium than schizophrenia. Both Jung and Hobson focus on how dreams are defective forms of normal waking life, but in dreams, our minds are in some ways able to function better than in waking life. Interobjects show the ability of the dreaming mind to notice how things that are very different nevertheless have features in common. The mind then creates a new category, which we might never have noticed in our waking life. The woman who dreamed of a \\"cellphone-baby\\" was creating a new category: small objects that are held close to the body and that make noise at surprising and embarrassing times.

Biography Charles Francis Avila was born in Taunton, Massachusetts, 17 September 1906. His facility for resolving seemingly insoluble problems and his vigorous leadership have contributed much to the electrical power industry. There is much in the tradition of Thomas A. Edison in the way he has worked, for Avila has the same far-reaching curiosity, the same unflagging interest in basic principles and the same unremitting perseverance. His early penchant for an engineering career became evident during his pre-high school days through his interest in the care, rebuilding, and refinishing of bicycles. He was recognized as a leader by and was a consultant to his boyhood friends in the numerous areas of model building and mechanical and electrical gadgetry. In high school be was most interested in the science courses and became an enthusiastic builder of amateur radio equipment. His limited budget made him constantly aware of the economic aspects of his projects. This combination of technological interest and economics led him to enter an integrated five-year program in Electrical Engineering and Business Administration at Harvard University from which be was graduated in 1929 with the bachelor's degree. Immediately after graduation he entered the employ of the Boston Edison Company. During these years he took the initiative in analyzing and solving the many problems inherent in the operation of the utility system. His contributions included a method of laying a half-mile length of cable across a lake without a barge to carry the reel; the development of a formula for safe pulling tensions to permit extra long cables between manholes; the design of a metal bellows as a flexible insert in sheaths to allow cable motion; the invention of a thermometer probe to measure accurately the temperature of cable conductors in ducts; the improvement of cable reliability by investigating the complex causes of faults under varying conditions. From this work he derived formulas whereby the combined cost of testing and the cost of outages were made a minimum. Avila designed tanks for transformers applying a zinc spray of bituminous coating to prevent their deterioration when salt water was present. He devised slots in unfastened manhole covers to prevent them from flying up. He was a pioneer in the use of neoprene-jacketed cables to eliminate stray currents and corrosion by electrolysis. He engineered the installation of the first high voltage aluminum conductor cable in this country. As Vice President and a member of the Executive Committee of the Yankee Atomic Electric Company and as a Director of the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, he has done much to develop atomic power in New England. Avila's method of dealing with cable failures led to his becoming a leading authority on cable design and operation. When a failure occurred, he was soon at the scene tracing the cause and minutely dissecting the faulty section to determine the source of failure. From these analyses, with the assistance of the engineers of cable companies, notable improvements in cable manufacture were developed. Avila's interests were not confined to electrical engineering. While at Harvard he read Ritchey's treatise on optics and telescopes and before long began grinding and mounting optical lenses which in turn led to the construction of a 6-inch telescope of excellent precision in definition and mounting. His enthusiasm influenced others and resulted in the formation of The Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston (ATMOB), a club which continues today. This club, with the assistance of Avila's expertise in optics and with the collaboration of James G. Baker of the Harvard Optical Research Laboratory and Harlow Shapley, worked on the design of an aerial camera for the National Defense Research Committee. Avila did the entire engineering work on the camera with automatic focusing for altitudes up to flying limits and self-adjustments for ground speed and distance, air density, temperature and plane rocking. This camera was used extensively in the Pacific and Korean Wars and is in use today for tracking missiles and satellites. Avila advanced through a series of positions with the Boston Edison Company until in 1960 he became President and General Manager and, in 1967, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. He is most interested in public affairs and contributes generously of his time. He has played a large part in the conception and shaping of the New Boston and is a director of many civic and business organizations including the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, the John Hancock and Liberty Mutual Insurance Companies, the National Shawmut Bank of Boston, the Raytheon Company, and the New England Council. He has also made considerable contributions to the field of education. As a member of the Executive Committee of the Society of Harvard Engineers and Scientists, he maintains close contact with the educational program of his Alma Mater; he was a member of the IEEE Committee on Relations with Educational Institutions. As a member of the Corporation and a Trustee of Northeastern University, he was instrumental in establishing the Power System Engineering Program, a five-year course sponsored by local utilities, designed to stimulate the interests of electrical engineering students in power engineering.

Roughly speaking, it asks whether a given Galois extension can be embedded into a Galois extension in such a way that the restriction map between the corresponding Galois groups is given. Definition Given a field K and a finite group H, one may pose the following question (the so called inverse Galois problem). Is there a Galois extension F/K with Galois group isomorphic to H. The embedding problem is a generalization of this problem: Let L/K be a Galois extension with Galois group G and let f : H → G be an epimorphism. Is there a Galois extension F/K with Galois group H and an embedding α : L → F fixing K under which the restriction map from the Galois group of F/K to the Galois group of L/K coincides with f? Analogously, an embedding problem for a profinite group F consists of the following data: Two profinite groups H and G and two continuous epimorphisms φ : F → G and f : H → G. The embedding problem is said to be finite if the group H is. A solution (sometimes also called weak solution) of such an embedding problem is a continuous homomorphism γ : F → H such that φ = f γ. If the solution is surjective, it is called a proper solution. Properties Finite embedding problems characterize profinite groups. The following theorem gives an illustration for this principle. Theorem. Let F be a countably (topologically) generated profinite group. Then # F is projective if and only if any finite embedding problem for F is solvable. # F is free of countable rank if and only if any finite embedding problem for F is properly solvable.

He was known for his military prowess, particularly displayed in the conquest of Baekje, as well as political skills that allowed him to maintain good relationships with colleagues and the strong-willed Empress Wu, but was also criticized both by contemporaries and later historians for insincerity.  Background  Liu Rengui was born in 602, during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui. He was from what would later be Bian Prefecture (汴州, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). It was said that he was respectful and studious in his youth, but in the disturbances that resulted in Sui Dynasty's downfall in 619, he was unable to spend much time in studying and was forced to flee the wars from time to time, and he would practice his calligraphy by writing on dirt. Early during the reign of the founder of the succeeding Tang Dynasty, Emperor Gaozu, one of Emperor Gaozu's generals, Ren Gui (), who was in charge of the modern Henan region, had drafted a report to Emperor Gaozu, when, for reasons unstated in historical records, Liu Rengui had an opportunity to read it. Liu was able to improve on the report by making several simple character changes, and this surprised Ren, who then recommended him as the military advisor to the prefect of Xi Prefecture (息州, roughly modern Xinyang, Henan), and later as the sheriff of Chencang County (陳倉, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi).  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Sometime prior to 640 but during the reign of Emperor Gaozu's successor Emperor Taizong, there was an occasion when a military officer, Lu Ning () -- who, by virtue of his office, was higher ranked than Liu Rengui (fourth or fifth rank, compared to Liu's ninth rank) -- was accused of crimes and held in custody at the county jail in Chencang. He, proud of his rank, repeatedly insulted and cursed at Liu. Liu, in anger, battered Lu to death with a cane. When this was reported to Emperor Taizong, Emperor Taizong, in anger, ordered that Liu be executed, but as he was pondering how a lowly ranked sheriff would dare to kill a highly ranked military officer, and so had Liu, prior to execution, delivered to the capital Chang'an for him to personally examine him. When he asked Liu the reason he killed Lu, Liu calmly, without appearance of fear, stated, \\"Lu insulted me and shamed me in front of the people I govern, and I got so angry that I battered him to death.\\" The chancellor Wei Zheng, who happened to be present, spoke on Liu's behalf, arguing that a reason for Sui's downfall was that the people had no respect for local officials and did not hesitate from resisting them. Emperor Taizong withdrew his order to execute Liu and further promoted him to be the secretary general of Yueyang County (櫟陽, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), close to the capital. In 640, when Emperor Taizong was about to go on a hunt in Tong Prefecture (同州, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi), Liu submitted a petition pointing out that it was harvest time and that the farmers would be greatly interfered with by a hunt, particularly since a good number of them would have to be conscripted to fix the roads. He asked that Emperor Taizong delay his hunt by 10 days. Emperor Taizong agreed, and praised Liu for his petition. He soon promoted Liu to be the magistrate of Xin'an County. Eventually, he was promoted to the post of imperial attendant.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign = Campaign against Baekje  It appeared that Liu Rengui remained at the post of imperial attendant for at least a decade, after Emperor Taizong's death in 649 and succession by his son Emperor Gaozong. In 656, he was involved in the inquiry into one of Emperor Gaozong's most trusted officials, the chancellor Li Yifu, as Li was accused of being enamored with a beautiful prisoner, a Lady Chunyu, and getting the secretary general of the supreme court, Bi Zhengyi () to improperly release her so that he could take her as a concubine. When the chief judge of the supreme court, Duan Baoxuan () realized this, he reported this to Emperor Gaozong, and Emperor Gaozong put Liu in charge of the investigation. During the investigation, Li, wanting to avoid further scrutiny, forced Bi to commit suicide, and the interrogation was aborted. Still, Liu's investigation drew hatred from Li. In 659, Liu was made the prefect of Qing Prefecture (青州, roughly modern Weifang, Shandong), at Li's instigation. In 660, as Emperor Gaozong was launching a major campaign against Goguryeo, Liu was in charge of supplying the army through sea shipping, but the ships that he was in charge of met a major storm, and a large number of the ships were lost. Li, hearing this, sent the imperial investigator Yuan Yishi () to Qing Prefecture, hoping to intimidate Liu into committing suicide, but Liu refused. Yuan put Liu in chains and returned to Chang'an to submit his report. Li insisted to Emperor Gaozong that Liu be put to death, but Emperor Gaozong pointed out that Liu could not be held responsible for the storm, instead reducing him to commoner rank and having him join the army in that status. Meanwhile, the general Su Dingfang had destroyed Goguryeo's ally Baekje in 660, left his assistant Liu Renyuan () in charge of the former Baekje capital Sabi, and then withdrew. Su's mistreatment of the Baekje people, however, caused much resentment toward Tang forces, and after Su's departure, the Buddhist monk Dochim/Daochen () and the Baekje general Buyeo Boksin/Fuyu Fuxin rose in resistance to Tang forces, with Juryu/Zhouliu (주류/周留, in modern Seocheon County, South Chungcheong) as their headquarters. They also welcomed back the Baekje prince Buyeo Pung/Fuyu Feng back from Japan, where he had served as a hostage-to-be-king, and their forces were strengthened. They put Sabi, defended by Liu Renyuan, under siege. Emperor Gaozong put Liu Rengui in command of an army that another general, Wang Wendu (), who had recently died, would have commanded, and had him aid Liu Renyuan. Liu Rengui was pleased at the news, and was said to have immediately leapt up and stated, \\"Heaven is giving glory and wealth to this old man!\\" He then, after confidently requesting the imperial calendar and the names of the imperial ancestors (in order to promulgate to the Baekje people for naming taboo purposes), departed for Baekje. Fighting the Baekje resistance forces in conjunction with forces from Tang's ally Silla, he was able to force them to lift the siege on Sabi. However, he and Liu Renyuan still had too few forces, particularly after Silla forces withdrew after suffering defeats, so for a time Liu Renyuan and Liu Rengui held defensive position. Meanwhile, Su, who had been attacking Gogureyo and putting its capital Pyongyang under siege, was forced to withdraw in spring 662 after the general Pang Xiaotai () was defeated and killed by Goguryeo forces. Emperor Gaozong issued an edict, ordering Liu Renyuan and Liu Rengui to abandon Sabi and march to Silla—and then, at the option of Silla's King Munmu (Kim Beopmin/Jin Famin), remain to help defend Silla or return to Tang. The soldiers largely wanted to accept these orders, but Liu Rengui pointed out if they abandoned Sabi, Baekje would be reestablished and would not be able to be defeated. However, believing that LIu Renyuan and Liu Rengui would surely abandon Sabi, Buyeo Pung and Buyeo Boksin (who had by now assassinated Dochim and taken over the rest of the army) were becoming overly confident and not taking precautions. Liu Rengui caught them by surprise and captured a number of cities they held, including a strip of territory that allowed Silla forces to supply Sabi with food. Liu Renyuan reported this to Emperor Gaozong and requested reinforcements, and Emperor Gaozong sent 7,000 men, as well as Buyeo Pung's brother Buyeo Yung/Fuyu Long, who was familiar with the territory. Meanwhile, Buyeo Pung and Buyeo Boksin were beginning to suspect each other as well, and Buyeo Pung killed Buyeo Boksin in an ambush and then sought aid from Goguryeo and Japan. At Liu Rengui's insistence, in 663, the Tang/Silla forces headed directly for the Baekje headquarters at Juryu, defeating joint Baekje/Japanese forces. Buyeo Pung fled to Goguryeo, and the rest of the Baekje resistance forces surrendered, ending the Baekje resistance movement. Emperor Gaozong recalled Liu Renyuan and left Liu Rengui in charge of Baekje's former territory. It was said that Liu Rengui was effective in comforting the Baekje people and restoring social order after years of warfare had rendered the region in waste. He was also credited with treating two Baekje generals, Heukchi Sangji/Heichi Changzhi and Sataek Sangyeo/Shazha Xiangru () with kindness, after they had participated in Baekje's resistance movement, pointing out that they were compelled to do so after Su mistreated the Baekje people—and he was able to receive their allegiance, allowing him to, with their serving as his forward commanders, defeat the last Baekje general holding out, Ji Susin/Chi Shouxin (). After Liu Renyuan returned to Chang'an, he endorsed Liu Rengui's abilities, and Emperor Gaozong gave Liu Rengui honors, including a house at the capital.  After the campaign against Baekje  In 664, Liu Rengui, by now carrying the higher rank of commandant, submitted a petition pointing out that the soldiers stationed at Baekje was facing much difficulties, after having been away from home for five years, and should be greatly rewarded. Emperor Gaozong partially agreed with Liu Rengui's pleas and sent Liu Renyuan to relieve him with new reinforcements, but Liu Rengui did not believe this to be the right course of action further, believing that the army should remain to prepare for the next campaign against Goguryeo, and Emperor Gaozong permitted Liu Rengui to remain at Baekje. However, the following year (665), as Emperor Gaozong was preparing for a grand ceremony to make sacrifices to Heaven and Earth at Mount Tai, Liu Rengui returned to Tang along with emissaries from Silla, Tamna, Japan, and the former Baekje, to attend to Emperor Gaozong during the ceremony. Emperor Gaozong was pleased by these emissaries' presence, and promoted Liu Rengui to the post of imperial censor, keeping him in the imperial administration. He also gave Liu Rengui the designation Zhi Zhengshi (), making him a de facto chancellor. In 666, Liu was promoted to You Xiang () — the head of Xi Tai (), the legislative bureau of the government and a post considered one for a chancellor. He was also made a member of the staff of Emperor Gaozong's son and crown prince, Li Hong. Further, for his battlefield contribution, Emperor Gaozong created him the Baron of Lecheng. However, it was at this time that Liu carried out some actions with regard to an old nemesis, Yuan Yishi—who had earlier tried to force him to commit suicide at Li Yifu's direction—that would bring both praises and comments of his being insincere. Initially, after Liu was first promoted to imperial censor, Yuan, who was thereafter a subordinate, was fearful that Liu would carry out retributions, but at a meeting, Liu poured a cup of wine on the ground and stated, \\"If I still think of what happened in the past, let me be like this wine.\\" When Liu was promoted to chancellor, he also had Yuan promoted to the post of secretary general of Li Hong's head of household. This brought whispers from many officials, and when Liu heard that people were commenting about it, he further promoted Yuan to the post of chief treasurer at the ministry of finance. One of Liu's subordinates, Du Jianyi (), was thereafter recorded to have told others, \\"This is an intentional overcorrection!\\" The Song Dynasty historian Ouyang Xiu, while generally praising Liu when writing Liu's biography in the New Book of Tang, commented, \\"As [Liu]'s career advanced from being a local official to being chancellor, he knew how to gain a good reputation and how to please his subordinates.\\"New Book of Tang, vol. 180. The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang was even more critical.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 48 (666). In 667, Emperor Gaozong launched another campaign aiming to conquer Goguryeo, commanded by the chancellor Li Ji, and in spring 668, during the middle of the campaign, Liu was made Li's deputy. After Goguryeo fell in 669, Liu returned to his post as You Xiang, but sought retirement in 670 on account of illness and old age. Emperor Gaozong agreed to let him retire. However, in 672, Liu was again made chancellor de facto, and in 673 was put in charge of revising the imperial historical records, as prior records, as written by Xu Jingzong, were considered inaccurate. By 674, Tang and its former ally, Silla, were in constant battle, as Silla's King Munmu had taken over much of former Baekje and Goguryeo territory and fostered resistance against Tang. Emperor Gaozong, in anger, declared King Munmu's brother Kim Immun/Jin Renwen () the king of Silla and commissioned Liu with an army to attack Silla. Liu scored some quick victories over Silla, but Emperor Gaozong, not wanting to prolong the confrontation with Silla, ordered Liu to withdraw after King Munmu formally apologized and offered tribute in 675. For Liu's contributions in this campaign, his title was upgraded to Duke of Lecheng, and he and three sons and/or nephews were given the honorific title of Shang Zhuguo (). Later that year, Liu and another high-level official, Dai Zhide, were made Puye (), co- heads of the important executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). It was said that they rotated listening to the people's petitions on every other day, and that Liu, who often would give the petitioners encouraging words, quickly gained a good reputation among them, while Dai was more careful with his words with them but often advocated for them before the emperor. Nevertheless, because of Liu's words, the common people came to believe that he was capable and Dai was not, and on one occasion, it was recorded that an old lady submitted a petition to Dai, believe that he was Liu, and once she realized her mistake, she yelled at Dai, \\"I thought I am giving my petition to the Puye who can do things, but instead I am giving it to the useless Puye. Give me back my petition!\\" Dai laughed and gave her petition back to her. In 677, facing the increasing threat from Tufan, Emperor Gaozong had Liu command the army stationed at Taohe Base (洮河軍, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai). However, he soon ran into conflict with another chancellor who remained at the capital -- Li Jingxuan, as his suggestions to Emperor Gaozong were often blocked by Li. To retaliate, Liu, while knowing that Li had no military talent, nevertheless submitted a proposal to Emperor Gaozong that stated that Li would make the best possible general for the coming military action against Tufan, and when Li declined, Emperor Gaozong responded, \\"If Liu Rengui told me to go, I would go; how can you not go?\\" Emperor Gaozong had Li take over Liu's post at Taohe, and in fall 678, Li's army suffered a total defeat by Tufan forces, and even Li's deputy Liu Shenli () was captured by Tufan and later died in captivity. Li would eventually be removed from his post by Emperor Gaozong. In 681, Liu, in addition to his other posts, was made an advisor to Li Zhe, the new crown prince (who had become crown prince after Li Hong's death in 675 and the removal of the next crown prince, Li Xian, in 680). Later that year, Liu resigned his post as head of the executive bureau, but Emperor Gaozong had him remain as chancellor de facto. In 682, as the Chang'an region was suffering from a famine, Emperor Gaozong, in order to reduce the pressure on the imperial food supply, took up residence at the eastern capital Luoyang. He left Li Zhe in charge of Chang'an, assisted by Liu and fellow chancellors Pei Yan and Xue Yuanchao. In 683, Emperor Gaozong summoned Li Zhe to Luoyang in anticipation that he would soon hold a grand ceremony to sacrifice to Heaven and Earth at Mount Song, leaving Li Zhe's son Li Chongzhao, the deputy crown prince, nominally in charge of Chang'an, again assisted by Liu, Pei, and Xue.The Zizhi Tongjian indicated that the son of Li Zhe left nominally in charge of Chang'an was Li Chongfu the Prince of Tangchang. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 203. However, both the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang indicated that it was Li Chongzhao who was left in charge, and as Li Chongzhao's position was higher than Li Chongfu's (as he had the unprecedented title of deputy crown prince), it appeared more likely that Li Chongzhao was in charge. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 84 and New Book of Tang, vol. 180. The Old Book of Tang did, elsewhere, indicate that Li Chongfu, not Li Chongzhao, was nominally in charge. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 5. After Li Zhe arrived in Luoyang, Emperor Gaozong, who had long been ill, died around the new year 684. Li Zhe became emperor (as Emperor Zhongzong), although the Still government was actually completely controlled by Emperor Gaozong's wife and Emperor Zhongzong's mother, Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), and even this time all the rights and powers of the empire were in her strong hands alone.  During Empress Dowager Wu's regency  After Emperor Zhongzong's ascension, Liu Rengui was again made Pushe, and he continued to be in charge at Chang'an, formally assisting Li Chongzhao. Just two months after Emperor Zhongzong took the throne, he had a dispute with Pei Yan over his desire to make his father-in-law Wei Xuanzhen (), the father of his wife Empress Wei, a chancellor, and Empress Dowager Wu, viewing this as a sign of his refusal to submit to her, deposed him and replaced him with his younger brother Li Dan (as Emperor Ruizong) — but the reins of government were by now even more firmly in her hands and not the new emperor's. As part of this move, Li Chongzhao was also deposed, and Liu became in charge of Chang'an in title as well, and Empress Dowager Wu wrote him a letter stating that she was entrusting the Guanzhong region (i.e., Chang'an) to him, just as how Emperor Gao of Han had done so to his prime minister Xiao He. Liu wrote back, offering to resign and citing old age, and further suggested to her that she should return her authorities to the new emperor, pointing out the example of Emperor Gao of Han's wife Empress Lü Zhi—who had controlled the government after his death but whose clan was slaughtered after her death. Empress Dowager Wu wrote back with encouraging words but did not accept his resignation or his suggestion. In 684, after Li Ji's grandson Li Jingye had started a rebellion and accused Empress Dowager Wu of various crimes, Pei tried to use this as reason to advise Empress Dowager Wu to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong. Instead, Empress Dowager Wu, angry over what she saw as Pei's betrayal, accused him of treason and put him to death. After Pei's death, it happened that a low-level official, Jiang Sizong (), was in Chang'an, and when Liu asked him about what was happening in Luoyang, Jiang made the remarks, \\"I had long thought that there was something unusual about Pei.\\" Liu thereafter wrote a petition and gave it to Jiang, asking him to deliver it to Empress Dowager Wu when he returned to Luoyang. Jiang did so, and when Empress Dowager Wu opened up the petition, the petition said, \\"Jiang Sizong knew that Pei Yan was plotting treason, but did not report it.\\" Empress Dowager Wu immediately had Jiang's limbs broken, and then strangled him. (Ouyang Xiu and Bo Yang both commented on this incident and were critical of Liu—Bo more so than Ouyang, and Bo particularly believed that this showed that Liu's good reputation came from his treachery.) Liu died in spring 685 and was buried with high honors. Empress Dowager Wu had the imperial officials attend his funeral, and had him buried near Emperor Gaozong's tomb.

There is some concern regarding development of the area and its surroundings. There has been extensive cottage development on the eastern and southern shores of the bay since the 1950s. Prince Edward Island's largest industrial operation, two french fry processing plants operated by Cavendish Farms, discharge into the Barbara Weit River in the southeastern corner of the bay. A petition was also organized in the early 2000s to stop a proposed wind energy project along the eastern shore of the bay which was submitted to Natural Resources Canada. However, the development never took place.

Smoke compositions are used as obscurants or for generation of signaling smokes. Some are used as a payload of smoke bombs and smoke grenades. Obscurants Smoke compositions used as obscurants generate large amount of thick, usually white, smoke. The most common smoke composition for pyrotechnic generation of smoke screens is the zinc chloride smoke mixture (HC). Zinc chloride smoke Zinc chloride smoke is grey-white and consists of tiny particles of zinc chloride. The most common mixture for generating these is the zinc chloride smoke mixture (HC), consisting of hexachloroethane, grained aluminium and zinc oxide. The smoke consists of zinc chloride, zinc oxychlorides, and hydrochloric acid, which absorb the moisture in the air. The smoke also contains traces of organic chlorinated compounds, phosgene, carbon monoxide, and chlorine. Its toxicity is caused mainly by the content of strongly acidic hydrochloric acid, but also due to thermal effects of reaction of zinc chloride with water. These effects cause lesions of the mucous membranes of the upper airways. Damage of the lower airways can manifest itself later as well, due to fine particles of zinc chloride and traces of phosgene. In high concentrations the smoke can be very dangerous when inhaled. Symptoms include dyspnea, retrosternal pain, hoarseness, stridor, lachrymation, cough, expectoration, and in some cases haemoptysis. Delayed pulmonary edema, cyanosis or bronchopneumonia may develop. The smoke and the spent canisters contain suspected carcinogens. The prognosis for the casualties depends on the degree of the pulmonary damage. All exposed individuals should be kept under observation for 8 hours. Most affected individuals recover within several days, with some symptoms persisting for up to 1-2 weeks. Severe cases can suffer of reduced pulmonary function for some months, the worst cases developing marked dyspnea and cyanosis leading to death. Respirators are required for people coming into contact with the zinc chloride smoke. White phosphorus White phosphorus is a popular base for smoke production. It is used in artillery shells, bombs, and grenades. Signalling A colored smoke composition can be used for signalling. These are usually based on a low-temperature burning pyrotechnic composition, mixed with a dye that gets vaporized and creates large, colored smoke particles. The composition is often based on an oxidizer (e.g. potassium chlorate, potassium nitrate, or potassium perchlorate), a fuel (e.g. lactose), an optional coolant (e.g. sodium bicarbonate), and one or more dyes. Fire extinguishing Smoke with a suitable composition can be used as a fire suppression agent. A pyrotechnic composition similar to black powder, composed of 15% charcoal and 85% potassium nitrate, generates thick smoke composed of particles of mainly potassium carbonate, which has fire extinguishing properties. Two-kilograms smoke grenades, thrown into burning rooms through plate-glass windows, have been used by some European firefighters. Dispersion of chemicals Smoke compositions can be used also for creating aerosol of other materials than dyes. Generally the same type of pyrotechnic composition as for colored smokes is used, with the dye being replaced by the desired chemical. The devices usually have the form of smoke bombs. The best known such application of smoke compositions is in riot control, for dispersion of lachrymatory agents. The agent used is most often CS gas, with less used alternatives CR gas, CN gas and Adamsite. In agriculture, smoke compositions are used to disperse insecticides and fungicides. Some agents used in this manner are permethrin, cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, imazalil, etc., and some fumigation agents. Smoke compositions can be also used for weather modification, namely cloud seeding, to provide cloud condensation nuclei for the moisture to precipitate.

It was incorporated on September 20, 1892, to build from the city of Allegheny to the South Side of Pittsburgh, with a stated distance of 12 miles; A branch of 7 miles from Allegheny to 39th St. in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville section was also included. As Oliver had at the time recently purchased a portion of the Pittsburg Steel Casting Company at 36th St. and Smallman, and already owned a mill in the Woods Run section of what was then Allegheny, the line was clearly intended to connect all these. The Street Railway Journal described it as a private street railway chartered by Oliver and Roberts Wire, an Oliver Iron and Steel Company predecessor, and a submission to Poor's Manual of the railroads of the United States in 1894 reported completion of trackage between South 4th and South 22nd Sts., Pittsburgh as well as between Woods Run and the Point Bridge in what was then Allegheny. Its initial board of directors was composed of David, Henry, George and James Oliver, Charles Black and Henry Lupton. The officers were David Oliver, President, James Oliver, Vice President, Henry Lupton, Secretary- Auditor, James Oliver, Treasurer and D. S. Kamerer, General Superintendent.Annual Report of the Secretary of Internal Affairs, Pennsylvania Department of Internal Affairs, 1901 It was controlled through stock ownership by the Oliver Iron and Steel Company and for most of its existence had the purpose of performing a terminal switching service in the South Side section of Pittsburgh. (71 I.C.C. 90, 1922) By 1903, John Oliver had become President of the railroad. The railway maintained connections with the Pennsylvania Railroad's Monongahela Branch (technically with the Whitehall Branch, a branch from the Monongahela Branch), and with the main line of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. The early years While the original line paralleling the P&LE; had been constructed under the guise of Oliver as the Pittsburgh & Whitehall Railroad, that road was subsequently sold to the PRR; Ultimately, only the portion paralleling the P&LE; was leased back, to be operated in conjunction with trackage inside Oliver Iron and adjacent factories. The initial locomotive, A&SS; 9, was a 0-6-0 constructed by the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works in 1896 on contract number 1605, was later sold to the Pittsburgh, Chartiers & Youghiogheny Railway, where it retained its number. Number 11, also a Pittsburgh-built 0-6-0, arrived in 1898, built under contract 1862. The trackage in Allegheny was not subsequently reported as part of the Allegheny and South Side, while at the same time the Oliver- founded [Pittsburgh and Western Railroad] had both prior and since included trackage in the area; Given the Lower Works passing from Oliver Iron's hands in 1897 a switching line for the iron company would have had little need for the trackage. The company entered into agreements with the P&LE; in 1904 and with the PRR in 1905 to switch carload freight to industries located between South 3rd St and South 21st Street. Loads came from the P&LE; yard at South 10th St and the PRR yard at South 21st St. The company was reimbursed $1 per car by the PRR and the cost of the service performed by the P&LE.; Because of the additional traffic, Baldwin 0-6-0T number 4 (contract 34710 of 1910), ALCo (Pittsburgh) 0-4-0T number 5 (contract 39950 of 1906) and 0-6-0T number 6 (contract 42745 of 1907) were delivered. After the Industrial Railways Case (29 I.C.C. 212) was decided, the contracts were abrogated on April 1, 1914. The company continued to provide switching service over the intervening months, until new contracts subsequent to 32 I.C.C. 129 being decided (on November 2, 1914) were effected on December 9, 1914, with the PRR, and on December 22, 1914, with the P&LE.; The contracts were applied retroactively to April 1. Under the new contracts, both trunk line railroads paid the actual cost of switching industries except A&SS; owner Oliver Iron. On June 1, 1917, reimbursement of cost, up to 97 cents per car, began being paid for cars delivered to Oliver Iron. Between the Wars It was decided in a 1921 Interstate Commerce Commission case 62 I.C.C. 248 Allegheny and S.S. Ry. Co. vs. Director General that the railroad did not meet the requirements of a common carrier, despite serving the unaffiliated Mackintosh-Hemphill Garrison Foundry Co., American Sheet and Tin Plate Co., and Newsome Feed and Grain Co., none of which were directly served by either of the Allegheny and South Side's connections. Not until 277 I.C.C. 119 nearly 30 years later would the commission reverse itself on petition from the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. In spite of this, when Oliver Iron sued the P&LE; over needing to bear its own switching costs when certain local competitors did not during the period between the new 1914 contracts being signed and the 1917 beginning of reimbursement of costs for switching cars to Oliver Iron, the I.C.C. awarded Oliver costs for the 30-month period in which none had been paid to the A&SS;, in 64 I.C.C. 477. In 1923, the Schnabel Company, builders of coach bodies, became a tenant in the A&SS; building at South 10th and Muriel Streets. In 1936, the Pennsylvania Railroad delivered 8000 carloads to the A&SS; during the first 11 months of the year.PRR 1937 inspection report The Postwar Era In the years after World War 2, the property dieselized with the purchase of a 1944 Whitcomb 65 ton 65DE-19a (ex-US Army) switcher, serial number 60410, from Mississippi Valley Equipment, their number 51, formerly Lancaster and Chester Railway; That unit became A&SS; 100\\\\. It was soon followed by an EMD SW1 purchased new, with money loaned by the PRR and P&LE; and repaid over time according to former officer Kenneth Haberman; That unit, serial number 14058, became A&SS; 101\\\\. Haberman also reported that 2 EMD employees trained the railroad employees for a month on the SW1. It was painted the same green as A&SS; 100\\\\. These 2 units replaced the 3 steam locomotives which formerly provided all service. On March 12, 1952, the PRR, the P&LE; and the A&SS; drafted a new agreement regarding switching services which would be performed by the A&SS; on behalf of the two larger railroads. A letter from P&LE; Vice President C.M. Yohe to his counterpart J.A. Appleton at the PRR dated April 24, 1952, notes that this contract has been executed by all concerned parties, supplanting the December, 1914 contracts. This contract named Theodore F. Smith as the president of the A&SS; in 1951 and 1952, and James C. Beech as secretary of the A&SS; in 1952. Since at least 1929, Smith had been President of Oliver Iron & Steel. The contract provided that the A&SS; would operate switching services for the trunk line railroads at tariff, on tracks between South 3rd and South 21st Streets owned by the PRR as their Whitehall Branch, and on side tracks of the P&LE; between those same streets, including intra- mill switching services. The exception was that tariffs would not be paid to the A&SS; for switching the mills of its parent, the Oliver Iron and Steel Company. Further, tracks belonging to the Iron and Steel Company between 10th and 11th Streets were required by the contract to be maintained by the P&LE.; The files of the American Short Line Railroad Association show that subsequent to the I.C.C.'s 1950 decision, the Association solicited the A&SS; for membership; Some time later, George B. Moser was appointed president, a position which he already held with the P&OV.; (He was also trainmaster with the PC&Y; at McKees Rocks.) Advertising by the railroad in February 1959 listed the office at 1101 Muriel Street, Pittsburgh 3, Pa, and the officers as G.B. Moser, President, W.I. Schaffer, Vice President, and K.J. Haberman, Secretary-Treasurer-Controller. At the time they owned 3 freight cars and 2 diesel-electric locomotives. Operations in the 1950s Kenneth J. Haberman, initially Chief Clerk, and then Secretary-Treasurer, recounted some details of operations. * The A&SS; operated on all 3 shifts. Heavy car movement occurred at 6:00AM, 10:00AM, and 3:00PM. * The Pittsburgh Terminal Warehouse was switched at 12:00PM and 5:00PM, with boxcars staged for loading and unloading. * Any needed special cars were ordered from the PRR, including idler cars for switching the various industrial plants. * While the A&SS; had a 3 stall engine house under the 10th St. Bridge, any serious work was done by the P&LE; at their McKees Rocks shops. * Diesel fuel was provided from a tank buried between 10th and 11th Street, adjacent to the engine house. The fuel was delivered by truck. * Excess profits during the Korean War years were used to redo all the trackage. * Installation of a yard for piggyback trailer service was considered in 1953, between 11th and 13th Streets, between the P&LE; and the river. The idea languished when the personnel who had been promoting it left the railroad. The end The railroad's affairs were entwined in that of its parent company, and an insurance policy was issued to the parent company (beginning with the November 1957 policy, the Oliver Tyrone Corporation) for the facilities of the Iron and Steel company (including remote offices and the Berry Division in Corinth, Mississippi) as well as for the railroad. As a result of the June 1956 sale of the Oliver fastener business to Pittsburgh Screw and Bolt Company, that company first became a tenant in the Oliver facilities, and then pulled out entirely with the opening of their new plant just south of Mt. Pleasant. The last insurance policy on file with the P&LE; was dated May 8, 1959, and was issued only to the railroad, as the former Oliver facilities including the railroad had been sold to Carson Industrial Development Corporation. The railroad dissolved August 1, 1959, and the line became jointly operated by the PRR and the P&LE; at that time, according to documents of the P&LE.; The files of the American Short Line Railroad Association suggest that a new Buda diesel prime mover had been purchased to remotor the railroad's Whitcomb, but the Whitcomb itself had been resold to the nearby Jones and Laughlin Steel Company plant leaving the orphaned Buda to sell. This exchange happened in December, 1959, at which point Hiram Milton, later with the County Industrial Development Authority and then the Regional Industrial Development Corporation, was listed as representing the A&SS.; EMD SW1 101 was sold to the Pittsburgh and Ohio Valley Railway where it continued its service into the 1990s and possibly later as Pittsburgh and Ohio Valley Railway 5. It was part of a group of EMD switchers which replaced 65 ton Whitcomb units like its former sibling at the A&SS.; Details provided by Haberman suggest 30 days notice of cancellation were provided by the A&SS;, after which the trackage was donated to the P&LE.; Customers The railroad serviced customers including the following, shown on ICC valuation maps: * Oliver Iron and Steel Company, its parent.

Summary “This Earth is soaked with blood,” Pola says, dispassionately. Her ability to stomach the harshest of realities - which allowed her to go on after the Holocaust, marry, raise children and live normally - is tested when she returns to a place that brought her unimaginable suffering. Pola's trip marks a dramatic shift in her mentality. After half a century, Pola, who never spoke about the Holocaust to her children, decides to travel back to Kraków with a bus full of high school and college students, lecturing and sharing her stories as they go. Her own children and grandchildren, curious about their family history and eager to offer support, join her as well. Before she takes off, Pola confides to the camera that she knows this trip will not be pleasant, but she feels it's necessary to confront truths she's been avoiding. The painful rumors that the Holocaust never happened spurred Pola to share her story. She realizes that Holocaust survivors are growing old, and when they die the truth about World War II could die with them. Pola feels obligated to educate young people in hopes of preventing future acts of inhumanity. Not everyone is supportive of Pola's decision to return. Her friends who also survived the Holocaust fear that her trip will take an unnecessary emotional toll. One of Pola's cousins went back to Poland only to want to leave the entire time. Other friends promised themselves they would never return. These women believe their old memories are vivid and torturous enough. They don't want new images to have to suppress in order to live happily. But the young students are grateful for her presence. They strain their necks and lean over seats to ask Pola questions. She brings to life what they studied in history books. Her stories fascinate them, and they sit quietly and attentively whenever she offers her knowledge. Pola's journey is full of emotional highs and lows. She's elated see her old apartment and speak to the new tenants. She's happy to walk through the old buildings she lived in as a girl and look at old photographs. But her stomach turns in knots when she visits the concentration camps and she is full of doubt as to whether or not the trip was a good idea. The Holocaust made Pola especially tough. After experiencing such great loss, she's become somewhat numb to pain. “I very seldom cry. Almost never,” she explains. But even she has to cover her face when sitting on the crematorium at Auschwitz. ProductionReceptionAwards *Pola's March won a Crystal Heart Award at the Heartland Film Festival in 1998.

It also takes press delegations to the Middle East and South Asia as well as running an annual conferences on subjects such as Xenophobia and Disinformation. Since September 2013, the International Council for Press and Broadcasting has merged with the International Communication Forum with the aim of eventually moving all of its activities under the banner of the ICF.  History  The International Council for Press and Broadcasting was established by the Next Century Foundation in 2007.http://internationalmediacouncil.wordpress.com It incorporates the International Media Council (founded 2000)http://www.ncfpeace.org/drupal/node/11 of the Next Century Foundation and the International Institute for Media Ethics (founded 2005). It works in cooperation with the International Communications Forumhttp://ncfmedia.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/middle-east-and-media- conference.html#linkshttp://www.icforum.org/events and the St Brides Forum.http://ncfmedia.blogspot.co.uk/2006/06/st-brides-forum.html It was established to eliminate confusion caused following the establishment of a second International Media Council by the Davos World Economic Forum organisation in 2006.  Organisation  The International Media Council and Peace Through Media is committed to promoting, \\"peace through media\\". Though it recognises that the business of publishers is to sell newspapers, it believes that the media has an ethical responsibility for encouraging harmony in today's Middle East. Convinced that the honesty or dishonesty in the media affects the mental health of the world, the Council believes that freedom of expression has a price. This price is continual vigilance - in particular vigilance in identifying and exposing the encouragement of malice or war, and the incitement of hatred in print and image. The current President is Dalia Salaam Rishani and the Chairman is William Morris. Trustees are Michael Binyon OBE (formerly of the Times), Gamon Mclellen (former head of BBC Arabic), June Jacobs CBE, Ambassador Mark Gregory Hambley, Deborah Pout and Laila Asser.http://internationalmediaawards.org/aboutus Delegations The Council has sent notable delegations to: * Run missions into Iraq on behalf of the UK Minister of State for Foreign Affairs prior to the Iraq war, to examine prospects for war avoidance.http://ncfiraq.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/ncf- delegation-for-iraq.html * Conducted electoral monitoring in Iraq, most recently in Iraq's 2010 elections, taking a team of Arab journalists into the country for that purpose.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmw7CVshynw * A fact- finding mission to Benghazi and other eastern territories under NTC control, that led to the US government announcing that it will be deploying predator drones over the war-torn country. * An International Media Council delegation was the last to meet Yasser Arafat shortly before his death in November 2004.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:International_Media_Council_Delegation_with_Yasser_Arafat_in_November_2004.jpg  Media Ethics Code  The Council seeks to promote high standards or responsible journalism, particularly with regard to conflict situations and areas of the world where there has been a history of animosity between populations. Accordingly, the council has published its own code of media ethics which it seeks to promote as a means on encouraging journalistic integrity. 1\\\\. Write the facts as you see them 2\\\\. A story without a source is a source of trouble 3\\\\. A source is not a source when the story is based on rumour 4\\\\. When in doubt, cut it out 5\\\\. Prejudge no one at all costs 6\\\\. Be objective 7\\\\. Divorce comment from news and label it as such 8\\\\. Commentators are not exempt from the duty to be accurate 9\\\\. Never incite racial or religious division 10\\\\. Enlighten, lest we fail to understand one anotherhttp://internationalmediaawards.org/aboutus/media-ethics-code/  International Media Awards  The International Media Awards are presented at a ceremony every year to honour editors and journalists with the symbolic prize of an olive tree. The awards are held in recognition of the vital role that the media can play in contributing to understanding, without which no peace process is possible. William Morris, Secretary General of the Next Century Foundation explained: \\"By publicly recognising the efforts of these editors and journalists, some of whom have put their careers and even their lives at risk through their commitment to reporting truthfully and responsibly, we hope to help raise the standards of journalism in reporting on the Arab Israeli conflict\\"http://www.ncfpeace.org/drupal/content/international-media-council- awards-2005 Media Credibility Index The Media Credibility Index is a relatively new publication, produced annually by the Next Century Foundation, together with the International Council for Press and Broadcasting. It was launched at the NCF's 2011 International Media Awards. It is currently being developed to try and cover a wide range of publications, assessing them in terms of press freedom, accuracy, incitement, bias, sensitivity and transparency, awarding plus or minus points as is seen fit. Points awarded are only based on items reported to the International Council for Press and Broadcasting that have been posted on the NCF media blogs. The purpose of the Index is to foster good journalism, responsible editing, balanced broadcasting and more responsible treatment of media professionals. It mostly focuses on Anglo-American media, the Middle East and South Asia. To view the 2011 and 2012 reports in full, please follow the link: http://internationalmediaawards.org/aboutus/media-credibility-index/ Merger with the International Communication Forum and future In September 2013, the decision was taken (later announced and formalised in December 2013) to merge the Council with a long-time partner, the International Communication Forum. The ICF is a global organization dedicated to a \\"committed to media ethics and the freedoms of expression and information\\".http://www.icforum.org/philosophy It recognizes that the media is one of the world's most powerful forces for good or ill. For the ICF, the media does not just report and reflect society but often shapes its direction. Through conferences and training programmes, the organization demonstrates its ethos and commitment to ethics and integrity in the Media on the basis of \\"people-to-people and conscience-to-conscience dialogue\\". Following the death of Bill Porter, the Founder and first President of the ICF in 2009, its activity significantly decreased with fears even being raised over its general future in a changing media world. The Chairman for the International Council for Press and Broadcasting, William Morris, took the decision in tandem with Bernard Margueritte, President of the ICF, as well as the rest of the members of the International Council for Press and Broadcasting, to merge the two organisations and its activities with immediate effect.http://icforum.org/ William Morris will become Chairman of the Executive Council of the International Communication Forum and though the International Council for Press and Broadcasting will continue to function in order to ease the transition process, particularly with regards to the organisation, planning and hosting of the 2014 International Media Awards. However, long-term, it is expected that the International Council for Press and Broadcasting will eventually cease to exist independently, moving all of its activities under the banner and direction of the International Communication Forum.

Currie was the Chair of the Budget and Taxation Committee before having to resign the chairmanship because of an ethics violation. Background Currie, the son of a sharecropper, grew up in Whiteville, North Carolina. He was the first of his family to go to college and earned his undergraduate degree from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. He served in the United States Army from 1960 to 1963, and was stationed at Fort Dix and in Germany.

The purpose of the bill was to increase the amount and diversity of capital funding available to high growth, early stage companies in the state of Utah in an effort to help them grow, prosper and grow up in Utah. Rather than invest directly in these companies, the program is structured to give incentive to high quality professional venture capital and private equity firms, both in and out of the state, to focus more of their investment efforts on Utah entrepreneurs. The Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act managing director and team evaluates quality venture firms with the assistance of the program's professional investment advisor. Venture funds that receive Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act investment dollars commit to work closely with Utah companies and entrepreneurs – with the goal of funding promising deals in the state. The Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act does not require portfolio funds to open a Utah office or commit to invest specific dollar amounts in Utah companies. Rather, the Venture Capital Enhancement Act requires a commitment by funds' senior management to spend considerable time in Utah meeting with companies in the state. The Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act took shape in 2003, in the form of Utah House Bill 240 (\\"HB 240\\"). An unfunded legislative workgroup crafted the legislation led by Representative Peggy Wallace, the Utah Information Technology Association (now the Utah Technology Council), economic development leaders, and entrepreneurs. The legislation surprised many observers by passing overwhelmingly through both the Senate and the House in its first year. In late 2003, Utah's Department of Economic Development (now the Governors Office of Economic Development) hired Jeremy Neilson to establish and launch the Utah Fund of Funds program. Neilson was handed the legislation and with the support of two volunteer boards and told to implement the legislation. Neilson set up the Utah Capital Investment Corporation (UCIC) and quickly became that entities only employee overseen by the Utah Capital Investment Corporation board of directors. Neilson worked tirelessly on establishing and managing the Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act. After legislative tweaks, validating lawsuit, RFP's, financing and more, Neilson launched the Utah FoF on January 26, 2006 to a standing room only launching event. Under Neilson's leadership, the Utah FoF became the nation's most successful contingent tax credit private equity program and arguably one of the most successful state supported private equity program in the nation. Neilson was the sole manager and sole strategist for the Utah FoF for over six years. At the time Neilson left the Utah FoF, the program had invested in 28 venture capital and private equity funds, in Utah, throughout the US, and even internationally. The Utah FoF had assisted in the creation of over 3,400 jobs with the average salary of $60,000+ that resulting in over $60 M of annual Utah tax revenue. The Utah FoF had a robust matching service that resulted in hundreds of Utah-based businesses getting access to hundreds of venture capital and private equity professionals throughout the world. However, a 2014 audit by the Utah State Legislature's Office of the Auditor General challenged the veracity of these claims. It also clarified that during Neilson's leadership, the UCIC awarded $330,000 in bonuses without any documented merit.  Financing  The Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act's $120M financing was provided by a third party, and is backed by refundable, transferable, contingent State of Utah tax credits approved by the Utah Legislature. The program is structured to be financially self-sustaining, with profits from Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act investments paying back financers. Only in the case of a shortfall would the state be required to place tax credit funds into the Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act. The 2014 audit highlighted that the Utah FoF's unusually high financing costs were greater negating all investment gains.  Structure  The Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act is governed by two boards that oversee and report on the fund's activities. The Utah Venture Capital Enhancement Act managing director directs the fund, with support from a professional investment advisor firm.  Success  The 2014 audit reported when reporting its success, the economic reports produced by the Utah FoF contained substantial inconsistencies and inconsistent methodology that has led the Utah FoF to overstate its economic impact.

Anthony Muse (born Charles Anthony Muse on April 17, 1958) is an American politician and minister from Maryland and a member of the Democratic Party. He is a former member of the Maryland State Senate, representing Maryland's District 26 in southern Prince George's County. He is also the senior pastor of the Ark of Safety Christian Church in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. In the 2012 U.S. Senate election in Maryland, Muse unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Ben Cardin in the Democratic primary, receiving about 16% of the vote to Cardin's 74%. Early life, education, and pastoral career Muse grew up in Park Heights, a working-class Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood. Muse has never met his biological father and only learned the man's name when he was an adult and got a copy of his birth certificate. His teenage mother, Gloria Watson, had four boys and a girl by the time of Muse's birth in 1958. Watson married a violent man who beat him, his siblings and his mother. When Muse was twelve Watson announced to the children that they were moving to Alabama to join a revival group and escape their abusive stepfather. On the day they were supposed to leave, Muse packed a suitcase and ran away. For a few months, he lived with an older brother. Then, he said, he passed through 11 foster families in two years. Muse left some of the homes after fighting with the children, or the foster parents. He was thrown out of Pimlico Junior High School, he said, after jumping up on a lunchroom table, kicking over students' lunches and starting a melee. His last stop on the foster care circuit was the home of the Rev. George Stansbury, a United Methodist Church minister whom he credits with imposing order on his life. As a teen he was hanging with the wrong crowd and Rev Stansbury saved Muse from a drug dealer that was going to harm him. By age 20, Muse was a United Methodist minister, assigned to Mount Zion UMC in Ellicott City. His youthfulness, his Afro and red Gremlin vehicle, surprised his new congregants. However Muse won them over with his dramatic preaching and by adding a guitar and drums to the service. Long before he earned his degrees he'd sign cards \\"Dr. C. Anthony Muse\\" to Nina Ringgold, a congregant who gave him money and cooked for him. After graduating from Morgan State University in Baltimore, he received a master's in divinity from Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington DC; then a doctorate degree of Ministry from Howard University. Muse is married to WRC-TV news anchor Pat Lawson-Muse. Together they have adopted daughter Lynell. Muse worked as a pastor at a number of United Methodist churches before founding the Ark of Safety Christian Church in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Maryland legislature=Elections Muse was originally elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1994 with 27% of the vote, representing District 26 in southern Prince George's County. He only served one term in the House, not running for re- election in 1998. He ran for Prince George's County Executive in 2002 and lost the Democratic primary. In 2006, Muse ran for an open seat in the Maryland Senate and in the Democratic primary defeated fellow State Representative Obie Patterson 55%-45%. In the general election, he won unopposed. Muse was reelected to the Maryland state senate in 2010 and 2014. Instead of running for a fourth state senate term in 2018, Muse ran unsuccessfully for Prince George's County Executive. Tenure In the Maryland legislature, Muse criticized the congressional and legislative redistricting processes as being overly partisan and discriminatory toward black voters. He has tried to expand financial literacy, protect domestic violence victims, and provide more rights to noncustodial parents. He has also been heavily involved in issues affecting Prince George's and his district, including attempts to revitalize Rosecroft Raceway in Fort Washington; in 2010, Muse sponsored unsuccessful legislation to legalize gambling on card games at the horse track. He also initially opposed allowing a casino at National Harbor, Maryland, favoring instead locating a casino at Rosecroft. Muse is also known for strong social- conservative viewpoints, including strong opposition in 2011 and 2012 to the Civil Marriage Protection Act and the 2012 Question 6 referendum on same-sex marriage. However, in 2014, Muse voted to ban discrimination based on gender identity after opposing a similar bill the prior year. Committee assignments During his time in the house, he served on the Ways and Means Committee and as chaplain of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus. Muse currently sits on the Senate Finance Committee. He was a member of the Task Force to Study County Property-Tax Setoffs and Related Fiscal Issues in 1997 and a member of the Bi-County Affairs Committee of Prince George's County Delegation. 2012 U.S. Senate election In January 2012, he officially declared he would run for this seat against incumbent U.S. Senator Ben Cardin. Muse came in second with 15.7% of the vote.

It is situated on the A583 road, from Preston and from Blackpool, in the civil parish of Newton-with-Clifton. It has a park, a pub called the Bell and Bottle, a primary school called Newton Bluecoats, a shop called The Convenience Store, and a petrol station. Another pub, the Highgate Hotel, was converted into a restaurant. Formerly the village was two hamlets: Scales on the main road from Preston to Kirkham, and Newton on a loop to the south. The name Newton is from Old English, meaning \\"new farm\\" or \\"new village\\"; Scales is from a word of Scandinavian origin meaning \\"hut\\". Newton was mentioned in the Domesday Book as a member of the fee of Earl Tostig. By 1212 it had become part of the barony of Penwortham. In the 16th century both Newton and Scales were referred to as manors. Newton Bluecoat school was established in 1707 by John Hornby for boys and girls up to the age of 14 years; it is now a primary school. It was rebuilt in 1864, and replaced by a new building in 1969. The township of Newton-with-Scales was part of the parish of Kirkham; by 1912 it had its own parish council and formed part of Fylde Rural District. Located east of Freckleton and west of Clifton, the township extended north from the River Ribble to boundaries with Kirkham to the north-west and Treales, Roseacre and Wharles to the north. It included the hamlet of Dowbridge on the main road near Kirkham. As of 1912 it consisted of 1,522 acres (including around 15 acres of tidal water in the Ribble estuary). Most of the area was pasture. The southern part, crossed by the Preston to Freckleton road, is flat and includes reclaimed land close to the river; the village is to the north on a slope that rises to 50 feet. As of the 1931 census the civil parish of Newton-with-Scales had a population of 343. In 1934 it merged with Clifton- with-Salwick (1931 census population: 428) to form Newton-with-Clifton. Formerly a rural community, it has expanded with many new houses built since the 1940s. Since World War II, Springfields nuclear fuel production site and British Aerospace at Warton Aerodrome have been major employers in the area, and also by the 1980s many residents worked in Preston, Blackpool and other towns in the region.

Alksandr (1952) History of the Byzantine Empire, 2nd english edition, University of Wisconsin Press, USA, vol. 2, p. 474Merry Bruce (2004) Encyclopedia of modern Greek literature, Greenwood Press, USA, p. 57 Byzantine philosopher of the eleventh century. He was Calabrian in origin, his father being a soldier.The Byzantine background to the First Crusade, by Paul Magdalino He came to Constantinople, where he became a student of Michael Psellus in classical Greek philosophy. He succeeded Psellus in his position as head of the philosophical school. Subsequently, some of his tenets were found heretic in 1076-77 by Patriarch Cosmas I of Constantinople, and in 1082The Byzantine Empire in the 11th Century he was personally condemned, being come into conflict with Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Life John Italus was born in Italy from where he derived his name. He was the son of an Italian, who was engaged as an auxiliary in an attempt by the Sicilians to withdraw from their subjection to the Byzantine emperor, and took with him his son, then a child, who thus spent his early years not in the schools but the camp. When the Byzantine commander, George Maniaces, revolted against Constantine IX Monomachos in 1042, the father of Italus fled back to Italy with his son, who after a time found his way to Constantinople. He had already made some attainments, especially in logic. At Constantinople he pursued his studies under several teachers, and last under Michael Psellus, with whom he soon quarrelled, not being able, according to Anna Comnena, to enter into the subtleties of his philosophy, and being remarkable for his arrogance and disputatious temper. He is described as having a commanding figure, being moderately tall and broad-chested, with a large head, a prominent forehead, an open nostril, and well-knit limbs. He acquired the favour of the emperor Michael VII Doukas (1071–1078) and his brothers; and the emperor, when he was contemplating the recovery of the Byzantine portion of Italy, counting on the attachment of Italus, and expecting to derive advantage from his knowledge of that country, sent him to Dyrrachium; but having detected him in some acts of treachery, he ordered him to be removed. Italus, aware of this, fled to Rome; from whence, by feigning repentance, he obtained the emperor's permission to return to Constantinople, where he fixed himself in the Monastery Zoödochos Pege. On the banishment of Psellus from the capital, and his enforced entrance on a monastic life, Italus obtained the honorary title of \\"Chief of the Philosophers\\" (, hýpatos tōn philosóphōn); and filled the office with great appearance of learning; though he was better skilled in logic and in the Aristotelian philosophy than in other parts of science, and had little acquaintance with grammar and rhetoric. He was passionate, and rude in disputation, not abstaining even from personal violence; but eager to acknowledge his impetuosity, and ask pardon for it, when the fit was over. His school was crowded with pupils, to whom he expounded the writings of Proclus and Plato, Iamblichus, Porphyry, and Aristotle. His turbulence and arrogance of spirit seem to have been infectious; for Anna Comnena declares that many seditious persons (tyránnous) arose among his pupils; but their names she could not remember: they were, however, before the accession of Alexios I Komnenos. The disturbances which arose from the teachings of Italus attracted the emperor's attention apparently soon after his accession; and by his order, Italus, after a preliminary examination by Isaac Comnenus, the brother of Alexios, was cited before an ecclesiastical court. Though protected by the patriarch Eustratius, whose favour he had won, he narrowly escaped death from the violence of the mob of Constantinople, and he was forced publicly and bareheaded to retract and anathematize eleven propositions, embodying the sentiments which he was charged with holding. He was charged with teaching the transmigration of souls, with holding some erroneous opinions about ideas, and with ridiculing the use of images in worship; and he is said to have succeeded in diffusing his heresies among many of the nobles and officers of the palace, to the great grief of the orthodox emperor. Notwithstanding his enforced retractation, he still continued to inculcate his sentiments, until, after a vain attempt by the emperor to restrain him, he was himself sentenced to be anathematized and banished to the Monastery Zoödochos Pege;Janin (1953), p. 234 but as he professed repentance, the anathema was not pronounced publicly, nor in all its extent.

The company was based in Houston and was part of privately held TNR Entertainment Corp. TNR was acquired by NCR in 2009. NCR had in 2008 partnered with Blockbuster to establish a channel for kiosk DVD rentals, and TNR's acquisition furthered this aim. NCR's DVD kiosks were purchased by Redbox in 2012 TNR was backed by an institutional investor group including Celerity Partners, LP of Los Angeles; Chapton Partners, LP, a Houston family partnership; Laminar Direct Capital, L.P., a member of the D. E. Shaw group of companies and MCG Capital, a leading specialized financial services company and financial advisor. Each of its interactive kiosks held up to 1,000 DVDs, including new releases and classic titles. To rent a movie, consumers swiped their credit card, make their selection and the machine then dispensed the movie(s). The charge per rental was $1 per day; and keeping a DVD more than 14 days was effectively the same as purchasing the DVD. The kiosks were located at grocery stores including Albertson's, Dillon’s, Kroger, Publix and others—and promotions included a “Movie Lover’s Survey,” “Movie For a Year” and a “First Movie Free.” The company also operated kiosks under the name \\"moviecube,\\" a California company which it acquired. History Founded in 2002, The New Release focused primarily on the grocery channel. The first kiosks were installed in Houston, HEB locations, with later expansion into Dallas, Kroger locations. Acquired by NCR in 2009, its kiosks eventually became the property of Redbox when Redbox acquired all of NCR's DVD rental kiosks in 2012. Promotions The New Release periodically created promotions to entice current consumers and attract new ones. The New Release held a “Movie Lover’s Survey,” where they gave away free movies to the first 500 respondents. The New Release gave away “Movie For a Year” to 45 customers throughout North America. In the past, The New Release produced a “First Movie Free” promotion in many of its locations nationwide.

During his career, he played for a number of professional and semi professional clubs, including Derby County, Shrewsbury Town, Peterborough United, Hednesford Town and Hereford United. His career was terminated prematurely during the 2001–02 season after a wrist injury. Early career Cooksey started off his professional career at Derby County in 1988, before spending half a season at Shrewsbury Town after two and a half seasons with the Rams. He was unable to break into the first squad at either club. Cooksey then joined Bromsgrove Rovers and started to attract attention of the professional ranks with stints at West Ham and Sheffield United, Cooksey eventually moved to Peterborough United in 1993. However at Peterborough, Cooksey was restricted to being understudy to Fred Barber and started 20 first team games. During this period Cooksey also had successful loan stints at non-league sides Welling United and Stalybridge Celtic. Hednesford Town Cooksey's big footballing break came in July 1995, when John Baldwin, then manager of non-league Hednesford Town, signed Cooksey from Peterborough. Hednesford had recently won promotion to the Football Conference, and Cooksey was to establish himself as one of the team's star players as Hednesford established themselves as one of the country's top non-league sides during the mid-1990s. Cooksey was almost an ever-present first choice goalkeeper during his three and a half years at the club. Amongst the highlights of his time at Hednesford included a famous FA Cup run during the 1996–97 season, which saw Hednesford progress from the early qualifying stages, right up to the Fourth Round proper. Cooksey was to play a pivotal role as Hednesford beat Blackpool 1–0 at Bloomfield Road in the second round, as he produced a series of breathtaking saves, with Hednesford holding onto a late 1–0 lead. After defeating York City 1–0 at Keys Park, Cooksey starred in one of Hednesford's most famous matches, a narrow 3–2 defeat to Premiership side Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium. Hednesford were far from disgraced though, as they gave their Premiership opponents a scare, taking a sensational early lead, and leading for most of the first half, before two late goals finally killed off The Pitmen. Cooksey and Hednesford's FA Cup heroics continued into 1997–98, as they beat Hull City 2–0 at Boothferry Park, in a match filmed live for Match of the Day. It was of little surprise, given Hednesford's run of good form during the mid-1990s, that several Football League clubs showed an interest in Cooksey, and his last few months at Hednesford were riddled with speculations of a transfer to a higher league. He was also called up to the England semi professional side, making two appearances. Shrewsbury Town In October 1998, Shrewsbury Town manager Jake King signed Cooksey from Hednesford for £15,000. Cooksey had been a squad member at Shrewsbury during part of the 1992–93 season, and he was hoping to make an impact at Gay Meadow, following his successful stint at Hednesford. He did not enjoy the same amount of success with Shrewsbury Town. The club were entering a rather mediocre period of their history, and were finding themselves struggling to remain in the Football League. Shrewsbury's first choice goalkeeper Paul Edwards was one of the stronger team members, and Cooksey struggled to dislodge him as first-choice keeper. His first-team debut was against Cardiff City at Ninian Park, where he gifted Cardiff their opening goal as he dropped a crossed ball, Cardiff eventually winning 3–0. He was only to make one more league appearance, a 3-2 win against Hull City at Gay Meadow, along with an appearance in the Associate Members Cup. Late in 1999, Jake King was sacked, and Kevin Ratcliffe appointed as manager. His position at the club was further compromised as Ratcliffe signed former Liverpool trainee Ian Dunbavin as second choice keeper, leaving Cooksey to find a place elsewhere. Hereford United In January 2000, Hereford United, then of the Football Conference, signed Cooksey on loan from Shrewsbury. With Cooksey once again an automatic first choice, he was a hit at Edgar Street and was signed on a free transfer in the summer of 2000. Cooksey was a first team regular as Hereford pushed for promotion from the Football Conference. Whilst 'The Bulls' were not be promoted during Cooksey's stay, he became well regarded at the club, establishing himself as the first choice goalkeeper. It was during this spell that Cooksey also won the accolade of being first choice goalkeeper in the England semi-professional squad earning a further two caps. Late in 2001 Cooksey picked up a wrist injury, and received an injection in order for him to complete the season. The injury was to become infected, and Cooksey missed the entire 2001–02 season. The severity of the potentially life-threatening condition meant a three-week spell in hospital with blood poisoning which had destroyed his wrist ligaments and severely weakening it. Bravely, Cooksey attempted to battle back to fitness, and returned to football in January 2002 with a solitary appearance on the bench in the FA Trophy replay against Chesham United. He was never able to fully recover from the wrist injury, and with the need for further complicated operations he opted to retire from professional football in February 2002, aged 29. Coaching and management Since retiring from football, Cooksey has successfully forged a career in education in his home town of Birmingham. He has also been involved in junior football in and around step 7 and managed Cradley in the Alliance during the 2006–07 campaign getting to the 4th round of the FA Vase. In November 2014, he was appointed joint manager alongside Barry Dedman of Midland League side Pelsall Villa. With Dedman's work commitments Cooksey took over the reins after saving Pelsall from relegation. The 2015–16 campaign Cooksey made the club more competitive but parted company in early February 2016 due to ill health.

Saunderson had a reputation for virtue; Colley Cibber described her as leading \\"an unblemish'd and sober life\\". One of her earliest roles was in The Siege of Rhodes, taking over the role of Ianthe in place of a Mrs. Edward Coleman, whom many agreed had done very poorly in the role. Acting under the direction of William Davenant, Mary did very well, even to the point that she was frequently called Ianthe for the rest of her life. She sang in several of Aphra Behn's operas. Perhaps her greatest and most lauded accomplishment was her performance in the role of Lady Macbeth. Actor-playwright Colley Cibber considered her \\"so great a Mistress of Nature\\" who was the only actress able to \\"throw out those quick and careless Strokes of Terror from the Disorder of a guilty Mind … with a Facility in her Manner that render'd them at once tremendous and delightful\\".Lanier, Henry Wysham. The first English actresses, from the initial appearance of women on the stage in 1660 till 1700. The Players, 1930. She played the major female roles for about 30 years, until she gradually faded out of the stage lights in the early 1690s. Her final appearance was in John Dryden's last play, Love Triumphant, where she played the leading female role.  Teaching career  As acting was one of Betterton's most beloved passions, she also had the desire to put forth her talents as a way of educating and influencing the young minds around her. Mary Betterton and her husband even informally adopted actress, Anne Bracegirdle, and played a key role in training her for the very successful and popular stage career that she would have. Bracegirdle was also known as, \\"the celebrated virgin,\\" meaning that she was popular for not being the risqué stereotype that came with many actresses during this time.Lowe, Robert W. Thomas Betterton. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co, 1891. Print. The \\"celebrated virgin\\" label that Bracegirdle received was easily attributed to the moral teachings that Betterton also provided when training the young actress. Mary Betterton was such a positive light and educator to young actresses that King Charles II requested her as his first choice to train his nieces (daughters of his younger brother) to become great actresses, which is a huge reflection of how respected she was as an acting coach and mentor.Smith, Gay. Lady Macbeth in America: From the Stage to the White House. Palgrave Macmillan. 2010. Print. As Lady Anne and Lady Mary grew up to be Queens, the work of Betterton could be seen in their speeches with their \\"clear and direct voices\\". Betterton had a lasting impact on these women, so much so that when Thomas Betterton died, Queen Anne granted her a yearly pension to ensure that she was taken care of financially.  Personal life  Mary Betterton was a granddaughter of Richard Burbage, one of William Shakespeare's men, one of the first and most famous Shakespearean actors. Very little or if anything is known of her childhood. The first information that can be found of her is that Sir William Davenant hired her to perform for the Duke's Company in 1661. She lived with other actresses in the company including Hester Davenport under his wife's care until she and the leading man of the company, Thomas Betterton, obtained a marriage license on Christmas Eve in 1662.Macqueen-Pope, W. Ladies First. W. H. Allen, 1952. Their marriage lasted for some 48 years under \\"the strictest amity\\" until her husband's death in 1710.Milhous, Judith. \\"Betterton [Saunderson], Mary (c.1637–1712).\\" Judith Milhous. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Online ed. Ed. David Cannadine. Oxford: OUP, 2004. 20 February 2017. Mrs. Betterton was different than many other English actresses, in that she attracted no public chatter or gossip about her personal life; she was simply not interested in enticing any foolish blather about her life off stage.

He was a professional sprinter who won more than 300 races and was regarded as the American sprinting champion from 1872 to 1878. Moulton later worked as a trainer of sprinters, wrestlers, boxers, and bicyclists. He trained many well-known track and field athletes from the 1880s through the 1910s, including the original \\"world's fastest human,\\" Al Tharnish, and Olympic medalists Alvin Kraenzlein (four gold medals in 1900), Charlie Paddock (two gold medals and one silver in 1920), Morris Kirksey (one gold and one silver in 1920), George Horine (bronze medal in 1912), and Feg Murray (bronze medal in 1920). In the 1890s, Moulton was also employed as a trainer and coach of American football, including one year as the head football coach at the University of Minnesota. Moulton also coached athletics and worked as a trainer at other schools, including the University of Michigan, the University of Iowa, and the University of Wisconsin. He spent most of the last 22 years of his life working as a coach and trainer of track and field, football and baseball at Stanford University. Early years Moulton was born in 1848 or 1849 at Saint Anthony Falls, Minnesota, now part of Minneapolis.Sources are in conflict as to whether Moulton was born in 1848 or 1849. Additionally, while most sources indicate he was born in Minnesota, some sources list his place of birth as Maine. He was reported to be \\"the second white boy born in the place\\". During the American Civil War, he enlisted in the 1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery Regiment at age 14 or 15. He participated in Sherman's March to the Sea and later became a scout and participated in \\"skirmishes\\" with the Indians during a mission blazing a trail to Helena, Montana. Professional sprinter Moulton developed a reputation as a foot racer while living on the frontier, and later became a professional sprinter. It was while working in the west as a scout that Moulton's talent as a sprinter was discovered. One published story recounts the circumstance as follows: > One morning ... a young buffalo was sighted and because the horses were all > picketed, the plainsmen were forced to give chase on foot. Moulton > outdistanced them all, gained two hundred yards on the buffalo, no doubt > very tired from trailing its herd, and succeeded in shooting it down. > Thereafter, his name was a by-word on the plains. He did not lose a race > that year. Moulton was considered the American sprinting champion from 1872 to 1878. According to one account, he won 303 consecutive races. According to another account, he lost only four of 306 contests in which he entered. Training and coaching career=Early years as a trainer After retiring as a sprinter, Moulton worked as a trainer of sprinters, wrestlers, boxers, and bicyclists. He trained 11 volunteer fireman's hose teams that won nine state championships. He first won acclaim as the trainer for Al Tharnish, who became known in the 1880s as the \\"world's fastest human.\\" In 1971, Sports Illustrated published a feature story on Tharnish. According to the article, Moulton discovered Tharnish performing in a circus and persuaded him to leave the circus. There were no open track-and-field events in the 1880s, and Tharnish ran in college meets, professional races and head-to-head challenges. According to the 1971 Sports Illustrated story, \\"For four years Tharnish and Moulton were never in a town longer than two days, but during that time they managed to clean the local sports of money, medals and most of the simpler satisfactions of winning.\\" Over the next four decades, Moulton also trained other well-known track and field stars, including world champion sprinter Harry M. Johnson, Sheffield handicap champion James \\"Cuckoo\\" Collins, Olympic gold medalists Alvin Kraenzlein and Charlie Paddock, and University of Wisconsin sprinter James Maybury. He also performed on the vaudeville circuit with a trained dog act. Midwestern universities During the 1890s, Moulton became involved in training and coaching football teams. In 1891, Moulton was the trainer and head coach of the football team at the University of Minnesota. The 1891 squad compiled a record of 3–1–1, including wins over Wisconsin (26–12) and Iowa (42–4). From 1892 to 1893, Moulton was affiliated with the University of Iowa. While at Iowa, he trained John V. Crum. In 1893, Moulton served as the trainer for the 1893 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 7–3 record and outscored its opponents by a combined score of 278 to 102. In 1894, he trained the University of Iowa football team. In 1895, Moulton returned to the University of Minnesota as the trainer for the football team during the 1895 and 1896 seasons. He also coached sprinter John V. Crum in 1895; Crum won the intercollegiate championship in the 100-yard and 220-yard sprints. In January 1897, Moulton was hired as the track and field coach at the University of Wisconsin. Moulton also reportedly worked as a trainer at the University of Missouri, Vanderbilt University, and Notre Dame University. Stanford Moulton in his later years at Stanford Moulton was hired as the trainer of the Stanford football team in approximately 1900. He also began training the track and baseball teams in approximately 1902. From 1903 to 1913 and again in 1916, Moulton was Stanford's track coach. In 1905, he rejected offers from Eastern universities, including Yale, to become a trainer at those institutions. He survived a bout with typhoid fever in 1910. Moulton transformed Stanford into one of the country's leading track and field programs. The track stars developed by Moulton at Stanford include Morris Kirksey (silver medalist in the 100-meter dash at the 1920 Olympics), Norman Dole (set world record in the pole vault in 1904), George Horine (bronze medalist in the high jump at the 1912 Olympics), Fred Crawford, Feg Murray (bronze medalist in the 110-meter hurdles at the 1920 Olympics), Leland Scott (pole vaulter), and the Templeton brothers (Rick and Dink). In 1907, Moulton signed a four-year contract with Stanford at a salary of $1,800 per year. In 1911, he signed a three-year contract at a salary of $2,000 per year. When the 1911 contract was announced, the Los Angeles Times reported, \\"Although Stanford did not have a successful year in athletics, from the standpoint of victories, 'Dad' is just as popular as ever among the students. He is a fixture at Stanford.\\" However, by the summer of 1912, the Los Angeles Times reported that students had concluded that greater success could be achieved with a younger trainer, although Moulton would likely be permitted to remain at Stanford for as long as he wished. With the exception of a year in 1915 when Moulton worked on the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, Moulton remained affiliated with Stanford until his death in 1922. Moulton also won acclaim as a designer and builder of tracks. He built the tracks used for the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition and managed the track during the exposition. He also built tracks at Stanford University, University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, Vanderbilt University, University of Tennessee, University of Wisconsin, Manchester, England, Notre Dame, Willamette College, and Pacific University. The Stanford Archives maintains two scrapbooks maintained by Moulton. The scrapbooks contain newspaper clippings, flyers and letters documenting Moulton's career as an athlete and coach and concerning his trained dog vaudeville act. Family and death As a young man Moulton married 15-year-old Emma Walter in Philadelphia on 13 January 1873. Emma later became an Indian Club swinger and toured theatres, also clog dancing and singing. The couple's engagements meant they were often apart and Emma filed for a divorce at Denver on 29 June 1893. The marriage was dissolved on 9 November 1893. (By then Emma had become acquainted with William B. Masterson, the noted lawman, gambler and sporting man, and she lived as Mrs. Bat Masterson for the rest of his life.) Moulton married cyclist Ida Peterson on 5 September 1901.Penn. Chris.

In general, the collision of high- energy particles can produce jets of elementary particles that emerge from these collisions. Collisions of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion particle beams create a hot and dense medium comparable to the conditions in the early universe, and then these jets interact strongly with the medium, leading to a marked reduction of their energy. This energy reduction is called \\"jet quenching\\". Physics background In the context of high-energy hadron collisions, quarks and gluons are collectively called partons. The jets emerging from the collisions originally consist of partons, which quickly combine to form hadrons, a process called hadronization. Only the resulting hadrons can be directly observed. The hot, dense medium produced in the collisions is also composed of partons; it is known as a quark–gluon plasma (QGP). In this realm, the laws of physics that apply are those of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). High-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions make it possible to study the properties of the QGP medium through the observed changes in the jet fragmentation functions as compared to the unquenched case. According to QCD, high-momentum partons produced in the initial stage of a nucleus-nucleus collision will undergo multiple interactions inside the collision region prior to hadronization. In these interactions, the energy of the partons is reduced through collisional energy lossD. H. Perkins (2000). Introduction to High Energy Physics, Cambridge University Press. and medium-induced gluon radiation, the latter being the dominant mechanism in a QGP. The effect of jet quenching in QGP is the main motivation for studying jets as well as high- momentum particle spectra and particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions. Accurate jet reconstruction will allow measurements of the jet fragmentation functions and consequently the degree of quenching and therefore provide insight on the properties of the hot dense QGP medium created in the collisions. Experimental evidence of jet quenching First evidence of parton energy loss has been observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) from the suppression of high-pt particles studying the nuclear modification factor and the suppression of back-to-back correlations. In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at center-of-mass energy of 2.76 and 5.02 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), interactions between the high- momentum parton and the hot, dense medium produced in the collisions, are expected to lead to jet quenching. Indeed, in November 2010 CERN announced the first direct observation of jet quenching, based on experiments with heavy-ion collisions, which involved ATLAS, CMS and ALICE.

She was a co-founder of the photography magazine Aperture. Morgan is known in the visual art and dance worlds for her penetrating studies of American modern dancers Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Erick Hawkins, José Limón, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and others. Morgan's drawings, prints, watercolors and paintings were exhibited widely in California in the 1920s, and in New York and Philadelphia in the 1930s.  Biography =Early life and education Barbara Brooks Johnson was born on July 8, 1900 in Buffalo, Kansas. Her family moved to the West Coast that same year and she grew up on a Southern California peach ranch. Her art training at UCLA, from 1919 to 1923, was based on Arthur Wesley Dow's principles of art “synthesis.” Abstract design was taught parallel to figurative drawing and painting. Art history was taught with significant emphasis on the primitive, Asian, and European artistic traditions. While a student, Johnson read from the Chinese Six Canons of Painting, about “rhythmic vitality”, or essence of life force, described as the artist's goal of expression. This concept related directly to her father's teaching that all things are made of “dancing atoms,” and remained a guiding philosophy throughout her life as an artist.Carter (1988), 13Patnaik (1999), 6 Johnson joined the faculty at UCLA in 1925, and became an advocate for modern art when many of her colleagues were oriented to a more traditional approach to art. She exhibited her drawings, prints and watercolors throughout California. In 1929, Los Angeles Times critic Arthur Miller wrote: “One of the finest sets of prints in the show is that by Barbara Morgan, and these chance also to be the most abstract works here. … Miss Morgan serves it with an aesthetic sauce that is not produced in a casual kitchen. So abstract has she become that we see her taking hints from Kandinsky, arch abstractionist of them all.” In the same year, Prudence Wollet of the Los Angeles Times wrote: “For out and out independence, Barbara Morgan has taken the most liberties yet… I contend that this experimenter bears watching.”Carter (1988), 8 In 1925, Barbara Johnson married Willard D. Morgan, a writer who illustrated his articles with his own photographs. Barbara assisted Willard in photographing the modern architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright and Richard Neutra, including a full documentation of the building of the Lovell House. Willard saw the importance of photography, which he claimed to be the real modern art of the twentieth century. Barbara continued to paint, feeling that photography was “useful only as record.” In 1927, Barbara co-curated an exhibition of Edward Weston's work with colleague Annita Delano in the UCLA Gallery. Weston's rich, brilliant prints of Californian and Mexican subject matter “rang the bell” for her when she was hanging this show at UCLA, although she found them \\"too static for [her] own style\\".Morgan (1964), 10 In 1932, she gave birth to her first son, Douglas O. Morgan, who later married photographer Liliane de Cock. In 1935, she gave birth to her second son, Lloyd B. Morgan.Knappe, Brett. “Barbara Morgan’s Photographic Interpretation of American Culture, 1935-1980.” PhD diss., University of Kansas, 2008, 3. Work in the Southwestern US Morgan painting the Grand Canyon in 1928. Photograph by Willard Morgan Every summer when classes were over, Willard and Barbara loaded their car, with painting and photography equipment and headed for the desert. Barbara painted as much as possible for winter exhibits and helped Willard photograph for articles. Willard had two Model A Leicas, with which the couple photographed each other in cliff ruins, climbing Rainbow Bridge, in the Hopi mesas and canyons. The resulting photographs were among the first 35mm images to appear in American magazines illustrating Willard's articles. Morgan's Southwest experiences were deeply influential to her. The stratification of Grand Canyon and Monument Valley attuned her to geologic time; Mesa Verde Cliff Dwellings to ancient human time. The Navajo and Pueblo Indian tribes through ritual dance displayed their “partnership in the cosmic process” and connected her to a universal primal. Work in New York City In response to Willard's Leica-illustrated articles, E. Leitz, Inc. offered him a job publicizing the new 35mm camera, and the couple moved to New York City in the summer of 1930. After one year traveling the east with Willard, Barbara set up a printmaking studio in 1931 on 23rd street opposite Washington Square Park in New York City. Carl Zigrosser of the Weyhe Gallery (NYC) exhibited her woodcuts and new lithographs of city themes. The impact of the city, its masses of people, traffic, buildings and the east, were in counterpoint to her memories of the Southwest. Out of this subject matter, symbolic forms emerged and she began to paint more abstractly, exhibiting her new work in a solo show at the Mellon Gallery in Philadelphia. While at UCLA, Barbara had been offered a scholarship by Dr. Albert Barnes, so while traveling the east, she visited his art collection in Merion, Pennsylvania. As a form of study, he allowed Willard and Barbara to photograph his entire collection. While photographing a Sudan fertility icon and an Ivory Coast totemic mask, Barbara discovered that she could make these ritual sculptures seem either menacing or benign, simply by control of lighting. This experience of dramatization of controllable meanings by light manipulation became the prelude to her “psychological lighting” of dance for camera compositions.Morgan (1964), 11 Barbara Morgan was deeply involved in the American Artists' Congress from its inception in 1936 and served as an exhibition committee member during Stuart Davis' presidency of the Congress from 1937-1939.First American Artists' Congress, New York City (1936) Photography Morgan in her studio, 1941 With two young children, Douglas born in 1932 and Lloyd in 1935, Barbara sought a workable way to be both a mother and an artist. To abandon painting in favor of photography seemed extreme, but for two saving factors; first, the emergence of an idea for a future book, and second, not requiring the uninterrupted daylight hours that painting does, and one could work at night in the darkroom. Although Barbara had exposed thousands of images, she still did not consider herself a photographer because she had not completed a cycle of developing and printing her own work. Thus she set up a new studio with a darkroom at 10 East 23rd Street, overlooking Madison Square, and began experimenting with the technical and darkroom aspects of photography in 1931. Barbara learned processing from Willard and worked on other gaps in her technique, chiefly with the 4x5 Speed Graphic camera and Leica with all lenses. She worked with Harold Harvey as he was perfecting his all temperature Replenishing Fine Grain Developer 777. During this time she started to explore photomontage.Morgan (1964), 12 Morgan was an early member of the Photo League in New York. Her photographs were included in the League's exhibition \\"This Is the Photo League\\" in 1949Barbara Morgan bio at The Jewish Museum The Barbara Morgan Estate is represented by Bruce Silverstein Gallery in New York, NY Dance photography In 1935 Barbara attended a performance of the young Martha Graham Dance Company. She was immediately struck with the historical and social importance of the emerging American Modern Dance movement: Many of the dancers Morgan photographed are now regarded as the pioneers of modern dance, and her photographs the definitive images of their art. These included Valerie Bettis, Merce Cunningham, Jane Dudley, Erick Hawkins, Hanya Holm, Doris Humphrey, José Limón, Sophie Maslow, May O'Donnell, Pearl Primus, Anna Sokolow, Helen Tamiris, and Charles Weidman. Critics Clive Barnes, John Martin, Elizabeth McCausland, and Beaumont Newhall have all noted the importance of Morgan's work.Patnaik (1999), 7 Graham and Morgan developed a relationship that would last some 60 years. Their correspondence attests to their mutual affection, trust and respect. In 1980, Graham stated: In 1945, with sponsorship by the National Gallery and the State Department, Morgan mounted the exhibition La Danza Moderna Norte-Americana: Fotografias por Barbara Morgan – 44 panel mounted enlargements, exhibited first at the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, then for a South American tour. Photomontage and light drawing Pure Energy and Neurotic Man (1940) In her continuing quest to do more with photography, Morgan “began to feel the pervasive, vibratory character of light energy as a partner of the physical and spiritual energy of the dance, and as the prime mover of the photographic process. “Suddenly, I decided to pay my respects to light, and create a rhythmical light design for the book tailpiece.”Morgan (1964), 25 She created gestural light drawings with an open shuttered camera in her darkened studio. Although photomontage was enthusiastically practiced in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s and 40s, it was still alien to American photography and widely disparaged. Morgan's knowledge of the European avant-garde, and her friendship with Lucia and László Moholy-Nagy, furthered her interest in montage. She was particularly struck by how the genre could capture the multiplicity of modern American life. She worked with themes of social concern and natural and constructed environments.Patnaik (1999), 8 Summer's Children and book design work Over the years her great interest in children's growth inspired many jobs located at children's camps, schools and colleges, and her own projects, which culminated in the book, Summer's Children (1951). Beaumont Newhall, of George Eastman House praised the work stating, “Her sensitive photographs, skillfully combined with words, capture the world of youth with heartiness and tenderness, humor and sympathy. Summer's Children is a moving interpretation of the magic world of youth.”Magazine of Art p.141 Morgan also designed and photo-edited The World of Albert Schweitzer, by Erica Anderson (Harper & Brothers, 1955), and made the photographs for Prestini's Art in Wood, for Pocohontas Press in 1950. Black Mountain College In 1943 at the request of Josef Albers, Barbara Morgan sent 24 photographs for an exhibition at Black Mountain College to accompany a lecture he was presenting on photography. The next year, Morgan joined the faculty of Art Summer Institute for a week during its inaugural year (1944) with Walter Gropius and Josef and Anni Albers, among others.Black Mountain College Bulletin, Art Institute, (Summer 1944), 9 During this session, Morgan lectured to the entire campus community on \\"the role of Light in Photography.\\" She did not teach a darkroom class, but rather used an outdoor workshop and placed emphasis on aesthetics over technique. Contributions Morgan's life and art were both infused with this profound sense of energy and purposefulness. “I'm not just a 'photographer' or a 'painter,'” she asserted, “but a visually aware human being searching out ways to communicate the intensities of life.”Patnaik (1999), 10 She possessed an innate capacity for close associations and lasting friendships with some of the most creative minds of her time, exchanging letters with Edward Weston, Gordon Parks, Margaret Mead, Buckminster Fuller, Joseph Campbell, William Carlos Williams, Dorthea Lange, Stuart Davis, Richard Neutra, and Charles Sheeler, among many others. She was a deep and trusted friend of Berenice Abbott, Wynn Bullock, Minor White, Ansel Adams, and Nancy and Beaumont Newhall. In 1952, Morgan founded Aperture Magazine with Adams, Lange, White and the Newhalls. Her work was included by Edward Steichen in MoMA's world- touring The Family of Man, which she reviewed for an issue of Aperture devoted to the show.“The Controversial 'Family of Man'”, Aperture vol. 3, no. 2, 1955 Morgan exhibited widely, including a second solo show at Museum of Modern Art, New York, and lectured nationally for nearly five decades. She was a guest instructor for the Ansel Adams Yosemite Workshops in 1970 and 1971. Her numerous articles in journals, her commentaries on art and photography, and her voluminous, lively correspondence have yet to be studied in depth. Morgan's archive can be found at the Center for Creative Photography located on the University of Arizona campus in Tucson, AZ. “How wonderful to behold a person who has developed all of these capacities because of her practice of living as a whole being,” Minor White wrote in the introduction to a 1964 issue of Aperture dedicated to her work.Morgan (1964), 2 She subsequently resumed work in drawing, watercolor, and painting as well, which continued through the 1970s.Carter (1988), 7  Published works  * Martha Graham: Sixteen Dances in Photographs (First Edition 1941, Duell, Sloan and Pearce) * Summer's Children (First Edition 1951, Morgan and Morgan) * Barbara Morgan- A Morgan & Morgan Monograph (1972) * Barbara Morgan: Photomontage (1980, Morgan and Morgan)  Awards and recognition  * Lifetime Achievement Award of American Society of Magazine Photographers * Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award (1986) * Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts degree From Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1978 ReferencesFurther reading *Carter, Curtis L. and Agee, William C.

The mine is operated by the Energy West Mining Company (out of Huntington) and owned by PacifiCorp Energy(a division of power utility company PacifiCorp). Most of the coal is shipped by truck to Hunter Power Plant, a coal-fired power plant owned by PacifiCorp's Rocky Mountain Power division, just south of the town of Castle Dale. Location The Wilberg Mine is located at (39.321078°, −111.122948°) with its entrance at an elevation of 7,602 feet (2,317 m). History The mine was started by Cyrus Wilberg in September 1949. In October 1968, the mining rights were bought by Peabody Coal Company, who idled the mine except for limited exploratory mining until March 1974, when energy prices saw a sharp rise. Utah Power & Light (UP&L;) (now operated as Rocky Mountain Power a division of PacifiCorp) purchased the rights to the mine on April 18, 1977, and then contracted out operating the mine to American Coal Company. In June 1979 Emery Mining Corporation (EMC) took over operations. In December 1984 the mine employed 326 miners, and 290 of those were working underground on three shifts-a-day, five days a week. Production averaged 11,000 tons of coal per day. After the fire, in 1985, the mine was divided into two separate mines. The mine workings on the west side of the fire seals became the Cottonwood Mine (MSHA ID No. 42-01944). UP&L; took over operating the mine, forming UP&L; Mining Division, on April 29, 1986, retaining most of the EMC employees. Composer and conductor Mack Wilberg is the son of a former part-owner of the mine. 1984 disaster It is most notable for the fire on 19 December 1984 which claimed 27 lives: 18 miners and 9 company officials. The disaster was the worst coal mine fire in Utah history. The escape route of the 27 persons was cut off when the fire quickly engulfed the intake of the 5th Right longwall. The fire was caused by a faulty air compressor, which was allowed to run unattended in an area that was not fire-proofed.Mine Safety and Health Administration, \\"Report of Investigation: Underground Coal Mine Fire, Wilberg Mine\\" (1987) In his article, \\"Remembering the Wilberg Mine disaster\\" in The Salt Lake Tribune, Mike Gorrell says: \\"MSHA concluded an air compressor with two defective safety devices started the fire, a theory rejected by Emery Mining and the union.\\"\\"Remembering the Wilberg Mine disaster\\" By Mike Gorrell, The Salt Lake Tribune, Article Last Updated: 08/06/2007 Casualties List of Emery Mining Corporation (EMC) employees who were killed at the Wilberg Mine:Wilberg Mine Memorial located west of Orangeville on State Route 29 * Phillip Bell * Bert Bennett * James Bertuzzi * David Bocook – (Mine Manager) * Ricci Camberlango * Curtis Carter * Robert Christensen * Vic Cingolani – (General Mine Foreman) * Gordon Conover * Randy Curry * Owen Curtis * Roger Glenn Ellis * James Hamlin – (EMC Vice President of Operations) * Leroy Hersh * Brian Howard * Barry Jacobs * Gary Jennings * Lee Johansen * Joel Nevitt * Alex Poulos – (General Mine Foreman- Longwall) * Kelly Riddle * Ray Snow * Lynn Robinson * John Waldoch * Lester Walls, Jr. * Nanette Wheeler * John Wilsey ReferencesExternal links * \\"Remember Wilberg\\", 2017 documentary of the 1984 mine disaster Category:Buildings and structures in Emery County, Utah Category:Coal mines in the United States Category:Geography of Emery County, Utah Category:Geology of Utah Category:Coal mining disasters in Utah Category:Underground mines in the United States W W Category:Mines in Utah ","title":"Wilberg Mine"},{"id":"12693486","text":"Těrlicko Dam (, ) is a water reservoir and dam in Těrlicko, Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic.

Beginning in 1952, Bowers’s contributions to numismatics have continued uninterrupted and unabated to the present day.Stack's: Rare Coins For Sale: Numismatic Auctions He has been involved in the selling of rare coins since 1953 when he was a teenager.How Q. David Bowers Began Collecting Coins Early life Bowers was born in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, in 1938. His maternal grandfather, Chester L. Garratt, an attorney by profession, was a hobbyist and researcher in many areas. Garratt gave him his first \\"rare\\" coin, a well worn 1893 Columbian half dollar. This would be his first exposure to numismatics. In 1945–46, his next exposure to numismatics was a friend’s home in which a dozen or more Indian Head cents were embedded face-up in a concrete walk near the front door. In 1948, his family moved to Forty Fort, Pennsylvania (about an hour away from Honesdale). As a 13-year-old high school student, Bowers's interests included reptiles, scouting, short-wave radio, Strombecker kit models of World War II airplanes, and rocks and minerals. During this time Bowers became interested in the written word. He received Raymond L. Ditmars' Reptiles of North America from his mother as a Christmas gift in 1952. According to Bowers, Ditmars, who was curator of reptiles at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo), had a way of making just about anything sound fascinating. From such experiences, Bowers learned the power of the written word and how it can spur one to a great enthusiasm for acquisition. He graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1960, and was given the Alumni Achievement Award by that institution's College of Business Administration in a ceremony in 1976. Interest in numismatics Robert L. Rusbar, a local tax collector, had a collection of rocks and minerals, and Bowers visited him. After a session with rocks and minerals, Rusbar asked Bowers if he collected coins, to which he replied in the negative. Rusbar presented a small green-covered album of Lincoln cents, pointed to one of the first openings, and showed that he had paid $10 for that particular coin. He carefully explained that it was a Lincoln cent made in the first year of issue, 1909, with the initials of the designer, Victor David Brenner, V.D.B., on the reverse. Bowers would soon discover that the reason for the high value was that beneath the date, there was a tiny \\"S\\" signifying it had been made in San Francisco. This mint mark jumped the value from a few cents up to the $10 he had paid. Bowers discovered that 484,000 had been minted and became inspired to find one himself. Rusbar would give Bowers a couple of blue Whitman coin folders and a few mintmarked Lincoln cents to get started. Inspired with the idea of making money by selling coins, rather than cutting grass, Bowers traded a $10 bill for 1,000 mixed Lincoln cents. Bowers' goal was to find the 1909-S VDB, 1914-D, and 1931-S pieces. From finding Lincoln cents in circulation, Bowers moved towards other series, including Mercury dimes and Standing Liberty quarters. Seeking to gain more knowledge, Bowers discovered the Numismatic Scrapbook Magazine, a monthly journal put out by brothers Lee and Cliff Hewitt in Illinois. The dozens of pages were filled with stories and tales about coins and coin collecting, but advertisements offering things for sale were a catalyst in stimulating Bowers' affinity for coins. The first coin Bowers ever ordered through the mail was an Indian cent, an 1859 proof at a price of $11 from the Copley Coin Company run by Maurice Gould and Frank Washburn in Boston. His enthusiasm for the Numismatist Scrapbook Magazine also resulted in an accumulation of back copies dating to 1935, and a file of several decades of The Numismatist. A local insurance agent, George P. Williams, would take Bowers under his wing. Together, they would attend meetings of the Wilkes-Barre Coin Club held in the YMCA. Bowers became a vest-pocket dealer in 1953, when he was not quite 15 years of age.Q. David Bowers: A One - Man Library He had begun collecting coins just a few months earlier, and he found he had an aptitude for buying and selling them advantageously. Bowers would start running advertisements in the classified section of the local paper seeking coins. As his growing dealership prospered, so would his capital. He would buy coins locally from the public and from other collectors and then sell them at the coin club and to collectors he met there. In the early years, becoming a dealer had its challenges as there were no guides to use as a reference. One of the risks included the authenticity of a coin, while another point of tension was condition. As there were no published standards, what one person called Gem Uncirculated could be what another might call About Uncirculated. By his senior year in high school, his business was flourishing, and coin dealing had become the young entrepreneur's principal extracurricular activity. Academically, he excelled as well. He was a finalist in the first National Merit Scholarship competition in 1956, and he won further academic distinction at Penn State University, graduating with honors in 1960. In 1958, while still in college, Bowers teamed up with James F. Ruddy — the first of several partners to figure in his career — to form the Empire Coin Co. in Johnson City, New York. The company rode the crest of the mail-order boom in the early 1960s to become one of the nation's leading coin dealerships. In 1965, Paramount International Coin Corp. acquired Empire. Bowers left the coin business to indulge one of his other great passions: automatic musical instruments. Numismatic legacy His work with rare coins is so voluminous and so extraordinary that he was named by COINage magazine as one of the Numismatists of the Century. Bowers’ dedication to the hobby and his lifelong interest in rare coins, along with his pursuit of scholarly knowledge, have made him one of the most honored and revered numismatists of all time. Bowers is the only person to have served as president of both the Professional Numismatists Guild (1977–1979) and the American Numismatic Association (1983–1985). From the PNG, he received their highest honor, the Founders Award; and he has received their Friedberg Award a record seven times. From the ANA, Bowers has received its two most distinguished awards: Numismatist of the Year and the Farran Zerbe Memorial Award. He was the first ANA member to be named Numismatist of the Year (1995), has been inducted into the Numismatic Hall of Fame (at the ANA Headquarter in Colorado Springs), and has received more Book of the Year Award and Best Columnist honors given by the Numismatic Literary Guild than any other writer. He has lectured at Harvard University and appeared on the Today Show as well as on programs on CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox, the Discovery Channel and the History Channel. The Q. David Bowers Collection of Chinese coins was sold in 2018: The Q. David Bowers Collection of Chinese Coins in Copper - sale in Hong Kong, 2 April 2018. Literary career Bowers is the author of over three dozen books on various historical subjects, including the following: * Muriel Ostriche: Princess of Silent Films, (1987) * Nickelodeon Theatres and Their Music, (1999) * The History of U.S. Coinage (for Johns Hopkins University) * The Encyclopedia of Automatic Musical Instruments, Vestal Press (1973) He has authored other works which have become standard references in their fields. He is highly regarded as a very prolific numismatic author too, having produced 50 works, mostly written in the field of rare coins, including the following: * American Numismatic Association Centennial History, Bowers & Merena Galleries, Incorporated (August 1, 1991) * Adventures with Rare Coins, Bowers & Ruddy Galleries (March 1996) * Silver Dollars and Trade Dollars of the United States (two volumes) Bowers & Merena Galleries, Incorporated (July 1993) * A California Gold Rush History He has also written hundreds of auction and other catalogues, and several thousand articles. Bowers serves as Numismatic Director of Whitman Publishing LLC, where he has produced another group of books including the Bowers Series covering various coin types in detail. In 1976, Bowers began writing a column, \\"The Joys of Collecting\\", for Coin World, which continues into the present day in both the magazine's weekly and monthly issues. Since 2018, Bowers has written a weekly column called \\"Bowers On Collecting\\" for Coin Update News and Mint News Blog. Bowers also writes a column called \\"Coins and Collectors\\" every month in The Numismatist, the monthly magazine of the American Numismatic Association. Interests Bowers' interest in cinema history dates from August 1957, when on a visit to Philadelphia's Pine Street district of antiques shops he purchased a collection of one-sheet Biograph, Vitagraph, and other silent film posters which had been deaccessioned by Harvard University and sold to a dealer in old prints. Since then he has built an archive of cinema periodicals and publications, including many items formerly the property of George Kleine, Martin Quigley, William Fox, and other notables in the industry. By the middle of the 1960s Bowers had assembled a large personal collection of player pianos, orchestrions, and other antique automated musical instruments.On-site observation and experience at Q David Bowers home by this Wikipedia contributor (Tparadise), 1965-67. Some, or perhaps many, of the pieces in his collection were later acquired by the Nethercutt Collection in Sylmar, California.In-person discussion by Wikipedia contributor Tparadise with Kyle Irwin, curator of musical instruments for the Nethercutt Collection, 2016. Bowers sold his 1912 Wurlitzer Style 32-A Concert PianOrchestra to Jerry Cohen in 1976. Business Bowers was the Co-Chairman of Stack's, a company that endeavors in rare numismatics auctions. It is based in New York City. During his career, he has catalogued and sold at public auction many of the finest and most valuable and important collections ever assembled. They include: * the Louis E. Eliasberg, Sr., Collection, the only complete United States coin collection ever brought together * the Harry W. Bass Jr. Collection * the Ambassador and Mrs. R. Henry Norweb Collection * the John Work Garrett Collection sold by order of The Johns Hopkins University * the Childs Collection, the highlight of which was the finest known 1804 silver dollar, at the time the second—and as of April 2017 the fifth—most valuable coin ever auctioned. Personal Life Bowers was married to Mary Masters from 1960-73, and they had two children. Since 1978 he has been married to Christine Valentine.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the 50th mayor of Baltimore from 2016 to 2019, when she resigned amid a scandal that eventually led to criminal charges. Pugh has been involved in Maryland politics since 1999, when she was elected to the Baltimore City Council. She has also held office in the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate, serving as the Majority Leader from 2015—2016. She first ran for Baltimore mayor in 2011 and lost the primary to Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. Pugh ran again in 2016 and won the primary against former Mayor Sheila Dixon. Pugh then won the mayoral election on November 8, 2016, with 57% of the popular vote, and took office on December 6, 2016. She was Baltimore's third consecutive female mayor. In April 2019, Pugh announced she was taking an indefinite leave of absence to recover from pneumonia. The announcement coincided with a scandal over a \\"self- dealing\\" book-sales arrangement, whereby organizations allegedly purchased large quantities of Pugh's books in exchange for contracts with the city. On May 2, 2019, Pugh resigned as Mayor of Baltimore amid the book scandal and on November 20, 2019, she was indicted by a grand jury on eleven counts, including tax evasion, fraud, and conspiracy in connection with the book transactions. The following day she signed a plea agreement, pleading guilty to four charges of conspiracy and tax evasion. On February 27, 2020, Pugh was sentenced to 3 years in prison to be followed by 3 years of probation.  Early life  Pugh was born as Catherine Crump on March 10, 1950 in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Pugh was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with her seven siblings. In 1967, she graduated from Overbrook High School in Philadelphia.  Education  Pugh earned a Bachelor of Science and Master of Business Administration from Morgan State University in Baltimore City, Maryland. She is a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Early career In 1977 Pugh began teaching Marketing and Introduction to Business at Morgan State University. In 1988, Pugh founded a public relations firm, Pugh and Company. From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, she was an independent editor for The Baltimore Sun and dean and director of Strayer Business College in Baltimore. In 1994, she returned to Philadelphia and became vice president of Brunson Communications and co-owner of a local Delaware Valley TV station, WGTW-TV, where she was the host of \\"Another View\\", a weekly public affairs program that focused on policy issues within the black community and featured interviews with community leaders and public officials. Political career Pugh entered Baltimore City politics in 1999. She is president and CEO of Pugh and Company, and in December 2016 became the 50th mayor of Baltimore City, Maryland. Baltimore City Council In 1999 Pugh was elected to the Baltimore City Council, where she served until 2004. She ran for president of the council in 2003, but lost to Sheila Dixon in the primary. Maryland General Assembly Governor Hogan at the 2016 State of the State Reception In 2005, Governor Bob Ehrlich appointed Pugh to an open seat in the Maryland House of Delegates, where she served from June 21, 2005, to January 10, 2007. She then won a seat in the State Senate and served there from January 10, 2007 to December 6, 2016. She sat on the Finance Committee and served as the State Senate Majority Leader. As Majority Leader, Pugh led the state on cyber security and telemedicine expansion legislation. Pugh is also responsible for diversifying the state's $40 billion pension portfolio, having led the passage of Senate Bill 606, which increased black and other minority managed dollars from $300 million to $4.2 billion. Pugh is a former president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and she's the past chair of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and the Women's Caucus of Legislators in Maryland. 2016 Baltimore mayoral campaign In 2015, Pugh entered the race for mayor of Baltimore and launched her campaign headquarters in the city. She was an underdog to former mayor Sheila Dixon until the early 2016. The endorsement of Congressman Elijah Cummings in April 2016 boosted her campaigning efforts. Pugh won the Democratic primary with 37% of the vote to Dixon's 34%. She won the November 8 general election with 57% of the vote, and took office on December 6, 2016. Mayor of Baltimore Pugh succeeded Stephanie Rawlings- Blake as Baltimore's 50th mayor. As mayor, she inherited several issues from the Rawlings-Blake administration. Pugh prioritized the United States Department of Justice investigation into the Baltimore Police Department following the death of Freddie Gray, before the inauguration of Donald Trump. In April 2017, Judge James K. Bredar approved the consent decree signed by Pugh and former acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, rejecting an objection by new U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Additional issues the Pugh administration faced included Baltimore's crime levels, vacant housing and revitalization development, and the cancellation of the Baltimore Red Line and launch of Governor Larry Hogan's BaltimoreLink bus system overhaul. Despite supporting it during her campaign, Pugh vetoed a bill to increase Baltimore's minimum wage to $15 per hour over five years, citing concerns about businesses moving out of the city and adverse effects on nonprofits and small businesses. Ricarra Jones, chairwoman of the Fight for $15 Baltimore Coalition, responded to the veto, \\"As a state senator, Mayor Pugh was a strong supporter of a livable minimum wage and explicitly promised to sign the Baltimore wage bill as mayor. Today, she has made clear that promises are made to be broken.\\" In July 2017, Pugh along with other city leaders announced a mandatory one-year sentence for illegal possession of a gun in many parts of Baltimore. The move was seen as an attempt to address the city's soaring violence rate. The Baltimore city council voted to water down the legislation. Resignation and criminal charges University of Maryland Medical Center in Downtown Baltimore In March 2019, Pugh was alleged to have accepted $500,000 from the University of Maryland Medical System while serving as a trustee to purchase her Healthy Holly self-published books to donate to Baltimore schoolchildren. This no-bid payment was controversial because the years of payments coincided with her tenure as head of a health committee in the Maryland State Senate and as mayor of Baltimore. She did not disclose the payments or recuse herself from votes and decisions involving the medical system. Maryland legislative leaders pledged to reform the medical center's practice of giving large contracts to trustees due the conflict it poses to their decision-making, which includes approving a $4 million salary to the institution's CEO. Pugh received $500,000 from the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) for 100,000 copies of her books, however the firm printing the publication confirmed it had only printed 60,000 copies. Pugh initially said that the University of Maryland Medical System were her only book sales, but on April 1, 2019, the Baltimore Sun reported that Kaiser Permanente paid more than $100,000 for copies of the book, and a nonprofit called Associated Black Charities paid Pugh's organization nearly $80,000 for copies of the book. Both organizations do business with the city of Baltimore. Associated Black Charities in turn resold some of its copies to other organizations, including CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, another Baltimore insurer. On April 8, 2019, all members of the Baltimore City Council signed a memorandum calling for Pugh to resign as mayor. Pugh said she intended to return to office following her leave of absence due to illness. On April 25, 2019, FBI and IRS agents raided six locations, including two houses owned by Pugh, Baltimore City Hall, and a nonprofit organization on whose board Pugh served. On May 2, 2019, Pugh resigned as Mayor of Baltimore. On November 20, 2019, she was indicted by a grand jury on 11 counts of fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy in connection with the Healthy Holly book transactions. The following day she signed a plea agreement, admitting guilt on four counts of tax evasion and conspiracy. = Sentencing = On February 27, 2020, Pugh was sentenced to three years in prison to be followed by three years of probation. U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow ordered Pugh to pay $412,000 in restitution. Additionally, Pugh will forfeit nearly $670,000, including her Ashburton home and the remaining balance of her campaign account totaling $17,800. Pugh has also agreed that all copies of Healthy Holly in government custody will be destroyed.Wallace, Danielle, \\"Ex-Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh sentenced for book sales scheme\\", Fox News, February 27, 2020 She has been granted several extensions to delay the start of her prison sentence. On June 26, 2020, Pugh reported to prison at Federal Correctional Institution, Aliceville. Personal life Pugh married her husband Phillip in 1973, and they divorced two years later; she has no children. She lives in Baltimore's Ashburton neighborhood in the Forest Park area of Northwest Baltimore City. A runner and fitness enthusiast, Pugh has written a series of children's health books called Mind Garden: Where Thoughts Grow and Healthy Holly, which advocate exercise and healthy eating. She is also the founder of community programs, such as the Baltimore Marathon; the Fish Out of Water Project, a program that promotes tourism in Baltimore City to raise money for arts programs for local youth; and the Need to Read Campaign, a program designed to help Baltimore residents improve their reading skills.

Papers cited below use for quantization Dirac's operator formalism. The other approach has been developed in.S.V. Klimenko, I.N. Nikitin, Non-Critical String Theory: classical and quantum aspects, Nova Science Pub., New York 2006, . It represents a universal method to maintain explicit Lorentz invariance in any quantum relativistic theory. On an example of Nambu-Goto string theory in 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time the idea can be demonstrated as follows: Light cone gauge. Time-like Rohrlich's gauge. Canonical transformation. Gauge symmetries. thumb Spin-mass spectrum. Lorentz-invariant light cone gauge is related with singularities of DDF vector fields. thumb Spin-mass spectrum. A restricted class of string motion is considered corresponding to the world sheets with axial symmetry. Lorentz- invariant light cone gauge is related with the symmetry axis. thumb Spin-mass spectrum. Lorentz-invariant Rohrlich's gauge is related with the period of the world sheet. thumb Experimental spin-mass spectrum of light mesons superimposed with prediction of string model. Geometrically the world sheet of string is sliced by a system of parallel planes to fix a specific parametrization, or gauge on it. The planes are defined by a normal vector nμ, the gauge axis. If this vector belongs to light cone, the parametrization corresponds to light cone gauge, if it is directed along world sheet's period Pμ, it is time-like Rohrlich's gauge. The problem of the standard light cone gauge is that the vector nμ is constant, e.g. nμ = (1, 1, 0, 0), and the system of planes is \\"frozen\\" in Minkowski space-time. Lorentz transformations change the position of the world sheet with respect to these fixed planes, and they are followed by reparametrizations of the world sheet. On the quantum level the reparametrization group has anomaly, which appears also in Lorentz group and violates Lorentz invariance of the theory. On the other hand, the Rohrlich's gauge relates nμ with the world sheet itself. As a result, the Lorentz generators transform nμ and the world sheet simultaneously, without reparametrizations. The same property holds if one relates light-like axis nμ with the world sheet, using in addition to Pμ other dynamical vectors available in string theory. In this way one constructs Lorentz-invariant parametrization of the world sheet, where the Lorentz group acts trivially and does not have quantum anomalies. Algebraically this corresponds to a canonical transformation ai -> bi in the classical mechanics to a new set of variables, explicitly containing all necessary generators of symmetries. For the standard light cone gauge the Lorentz generators Mμν are cubic in terms of oscillator variables ai, and their quantization acquires well known anomaly. Consider a set bi = (Mμν,ξi) which contains the Lorentz group generators and internal variables ξi, complementing Mμν to the full phase space. In selection of such a set, one needs to take care that ξi will have simple Poisson brackets with Mμν and among themselves. Local existence of such variables is provided by Darboux's theorem. Quantization in the new set of variables eliminates anomaly from the Lorentz group. Canonically equivalent classical theories do not necessarily correspond to unitary equivalent quantum theories, that's why quantum anomalies could be present in one approach and absent in the other one. Group-theoretically string theory has a gauge symmetry Diff S1, reparametrizations of a circle. The symmetry is generated by Virasoro algebra Ln. Standard light cone gauge fixes the most of gauge degrees of freedom leaving only trivial phase rotations U(1) ~ S1. They correspond to periodical string evolution, generated by Hamiltonian L0. Let's introduce an additional layer on this diagram: a group G = U(1) x SO(3) of gauge transformations of the world sheet, including the trivial evolution factor and rotations of the gauge axis in center-of-mass frame, with respect to the fixed world sheet. Standard light cone gauge corresponds to a selection of one point in SO(3) factor, leading to Lorentz non-invariant parametrization. Therefore, one must select a different representative on the gauge orbit of G, this time related with the world sheet in Lorentz invariant way. After reduction of the mechanics to this representative anomalous gauge degrees of freedom are removed from the theory. The trivial gauge symmetry U(1) x U(1) remains, including evolution and those rotations which preserve the direction of gauge axis. Successful implementation of this program has been done in . Concise Encyclopedia of Supersymmetry and noncommutative structures in mathematics and physics, entry \\"Anomaly-Free Subsets\\", Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht 2003, . These are several unitary non-equivalent versions of the quantum open Nambu-Goto string theory, where the gauge axis is attached to different geometrical features of the world sheet. Their common properties are * explicit Lorentz-invariance at d=4 * reparametrization degrees of freedom fixed by the gauge * Regge-like spin-mass spectrum The reader familiar with variety of branches co-existing in modern string theory will not wonder why many different quantum theories can be constructed for essentially the same physical system. The approach described here does not intend to produce a unique ultimate result, it just provides a set of tools suitable for construction of your own quantum string theory. Since any value of dimension can be used, and especially d=4, the applications could be more realistic. For example, the approach can be applied in physics of hadrons, to describe their spectra and electromagnetic interactions .

Its principal aim was to pressure the city's museums – notably the Museum of Modern Art – into implementing economic and political reforms. These included a more open and less exclusive exhibition policy concerning the artists they exhibited and promoted: the absence of women artists and artists of color was a principal issue of contention, which led to the formation of Women Artists in Revolution (WAR) in 1969. The coalition successfully pressured the MoMA and other museums into implementing a free admission day that still exists in certain museums to this day. It also pressured and picketed museums into taking a moral stance on the Vietnam War which resulted in its famous My Lai poster And babies, one of the most important works of political art of the early 1970s. The poster was displayed during demonstrations in front of Pablo Picasso′s Guernica at the MoMA in 1970. Origins The AWC grew out of an incident at MoMA during the exhibition curated by Pontus Hulten, The Machine at the End of the Mechanical Age: on January 3, 1969, Greek kinetic sculptor Takis, with the support of friends, physically removed his work from the exhibition. Although the work, Tele- sculpture (1960), had been purchased by the MoMA in 1963 and thus belonged to its permanent collection, Takis was unhappy with the museum's lack of consultation in choosing a work for exhibition which he considered no longer adequately represented his current artistic practice. The artist took his work into the museum's sculpture garden and remained there until he received confirmation from museum officials that his work would be withdrawn from the exhibition. The incident led to a series of meetings held at the Chelsea Hotel in which the group that had supported Takis's action discussed issues relating to the political and social responsibility of the art community. The group included Takis, American kinetic sculptor Wen-Ying Tsai, German conceptual artist Hans Haacke, American writer and independent curator Willoughby Sharp, co-founder of Avalanche Liza Bear, American artist and Village Voice art critic John Perreault, and American minimalist artist Carl Andre. On January 28, 1969, the AWC presented MoMa's director Bates Lowry with a list of 13 demands.  13 Demands  The 13 Demands that AWC submitted to Lowry were as follows: # The Museum should hold a public hearing during February on the topic \\"The Museum's Relationship to Artists and to Society\\", which should conform to the recognized rules of procedure for public hearings. # A section of the Museum, under the direction of black artists, should be devoted to showing the accomplishments of Black artists. # The Museum's activities should be extended into the Black, Spanish and other communities. It should also encourage exhibits with which these groups can identify. # A committee of artists with curatorial responsibilities should be set up annually to arrange exhibits. # The Museum should be open on two evenings until midnight and admission should be free at all times. # Artists should be paid a rental fee for the exhibition of their works. # The Museum should recognize an artist's right to refuse showing a work owned by the Museum in any exhibition other than one of the Museum's permanent collection. # The Museum should declare its position on copyright legislation and the proposed arts proceeds act. It should also take active steps to inform artists of their legal rights. # A registry of artists should be instituted at the Museum. Artists who wish to be registered should supply the Museum with documentation of their work, in the form of photographs, news clippings, etc., and this material should be added to the existing artists' files. # The Museum should exhibit experimental works requiring unique environmental conditions at locations outside the Museum. # A section of the Museum should be permanently devoted to showing the works of artists without galleries. # The Museum should include among its staff persons qualified to handle the installation and maintenance of technological works. # The Museum should appoint a responsible person to handle any grievances arising from its dealings with artists. Subsequent Activities Upon receiving AWC's 13 Demands, MoMA met and held a dialogue with artist representatives from AWC that was publicly acknowledged. Lowry and MoMA, however, refused to meet all of the specific demands of the AWC, such as the demand to hold a public hearing on the topic \\"The Museum's Relationship to Artists and to Society\\". After organizing a number of demonstrations in front of the museum, the group held an open hearing at the New York School of Visual Arts on 10 April 1969. The event was retitled \\"What Should Be the Program of The Art Workers Regarding Museum Reform, and to Establish the Program of the Art Workers' Coalition.\\" Some three hundred artists and members of the New York art community attended the hearing. The initial demands that had been made to the MoMA were debated within the larger group that formed during the open hearing, and later refined and addressed to all New York Museums. Artists and critics subsequently debated various subjects of contention including artists' rights, museum policy and broader political issues including the Vietnam War. On 15 October 1969, the AWC organized a successful \\"Moratorium of Art to End the War in Vietnam.\\" The MoMA, the Whitney Museum, the Jewish Museum and a large number of commercial art galleries closed for the day. The Metropolitan Museum and the Guggenheim Museum did not comply, although, under pressure from the AWC, the Metropolitan did postpone the opening of its American painting and sculpture show scheduled for that day, while the Guggenheim was picketed. The coalition's activities eventually led to changes in how museums interact with artists, a contribution to the art world that is considered lasting in spite of the coalition's short three-year existence. The AWC ceased its activities at the end of 1971.

In order to advance his temporal title and marry he became, , the only authenticated apostate in the Catholic hierarchy in IrelandO'Connor (2004) Early life Butler was the third son of Edmond Butler, 8th Baron Dunboyne (died 1732) and the widow Anne Nagle, née Grace. The family was part of a wealthy network of landed Butlers across Leinster and Munster. However, the family was subject to the British government's policy of curtailment of civil rights of Irish Catholics (see, Ireland 1691–1801:The Penal Laws). Raised a Roman Catholic, John early acknowledged a vocation for the Church. His brothers, Pierce and Edmond chose the army and left the family home to fight in the War of the Austrian Succession. Butler commenced his studies at the Irish College in Rome, managing to lose his left eye in a duel, and was ordained priest in 1755 in the Basilica of St. John Lateran.Lenihan, Michael. Hidden Cork, Mercier Press Ltd, 2010 He returned to Ireland in 1758, having completed his doctorate, though his Catholic credentials entailed an interview before a Justice of the Peace in Whitehaven. Butler returned to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly, being appointed parish priest of Ardmayle in 1759. While he was establishing his place in the Church hierarchy, becoming an archdeacon and secretary to the bishop, he was also bolstering his secular role in the Butler family network. Bishop of Cork The post of Bishop of Cork fell vacant in 1763 and Butler won immediate support as the leading candidate, being appointed by Pope Clement XIII in 1763. The years following his appointment marked a reduction in the civil disabilities of Catholics in Ireland and the relaxation afforded the Church the opportunity finally to implement the decrees of the Council of Trent in respect of the Irish hierarchy. Butler led the changes but was careful to use his secular network and status to maintain relationships with the Protestant establishment. For fear of Protestant sentiment, Butler stalled Nano Nagle's establishment of the Ursulines in Cork until 1771 and published a condemnation of the 1766 Cork coopers' riots.Hibernian Chronicle, 2 July 1766 Stole fees and other dues were resented and sometimes provided a pretext for Whiteboy violence towards clergy. Butler issued a declaration, Statuta synodalia pro dioecesi Corcagiensi (1768), that involvement in the Whiteboys was a reserved sin. He supported the Test Act 1774 and gave substantial financial backing to the Catholic Committee. Baron Dunboyne Butler inherited the title of Baron Dunboyne in December 1785 on the death of his nephew Pierce Edmond Creagh Butler, 11th Baron Dunboyne. Butler was childless and the Barony threatened with extinction if he had no heir, but as a priest, he was not permitted to marry. In December 1786, he resigned as bishop and asked the pope for a dispensation from the ban on clerical marriage. The petition was refused. In spite of the refusal, in 1787 he married a cousin, Maria (1764/5-1860), the daughter of Theobald Butler.\\"Rt Rev John Butler, de jure 12th Baron Dunboyne\\", Cracroft's Peerage He took the oath of allegiance, abjuration, and supremacy. He moved to his ancestral home at Dunboyne, County Meath, where the couple had a daughter who died quite young, and then to Dublin. Dunboyne, and the Catholic chapel, were burned in the 1798 rising. Dunboyne offered to have it rebuilt at his own expense, and donated his chalice to the parish priest at Fethard. In 1800, an aged and infirm Butler wrote a letter of repentance to the pope, executed a will, and made his confession to Catholic priest Fr. William Gahan. He died in Dublin and was buried in the Augustinian friary at Fethard, County Tipperary. Testamentary litigation Butler left his property to St Patrick's College, Maynooth and litigation from his family, notably by his sister, Mrs. Catherine O'Brien-Butler of Bansha Castle, County Tipperary, was swift. The legality of the will was challenged as the Penal Laws deprived Catholics of the right to make a will and a sequence of legal actions, such as Butler v. Moore (1802),Nolan (1913) ensued before a compromise between the college and the family in 1808. The compromise led to the Dunboyne establishment at the college to endow scholarships.

debate over medical marijuana in the Maryland General Assembly, Senator Brochin professed his support for medical marijuana. In a mailed form letter on 6.9.10, Mr Brochin wrote: \\"I supported the medical marijuana bill which could relieve the suffering of our most vulnerable citizens. [The bill] allows someone who has pain through a chronic or terminal illness to be prescribed medical marijuana. Medical marijuana has been shown to stimulate appetite for those that must undergo chemotherapy.\\" =LGBT issues= In 2011, The Washington Post reported that Brochin would support same sex-marriage in the state of Maryland: \\"Brochin said at a news conference that while he has been willing to support civil unions between gay couples previously, the word \\"marriage\\" was a \\"stumbling block\\". He later called testimony from same-sex marriage opponents \\"appalling and disgusting. ... I just heard hate and venom coming out of that hearing.\\" The Advocate found similar statements from the senator. In the article he is quoted as saying: \\"What I witnessed from the opponents of the bill was appalling ... Witness after witness demonized homosexuals, vilified the gay community, and described gays and lesbians as pedophiles. I believe that sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather people are born one way or another. The proponents of the bill were straightforward in wanting to be simply treated as everyone else, and wanted to stop being treated as second-class citizens.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins, Oakland Athletics and Texas Rangers. He bats and throws right-handed. He has also played for the SK Wyverns of the Korea Baseball Championship. Wolf attended Newton Community High School in Newton, Illinois and Wabash Valley College in Mount Carmel, Illinois. Professional career Wolf was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 47th round (1390th overall) in the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. However, he refused to sign with them and remained a free agent. He was selected the following year by the Florida Marlins in the 18th round (533rd overall) in the 2002 Major League Baseball draft, this time accepting the position. After the 2013 season, he moved to Korea Baseball Championship. SK Wyverns is his new team. Florida Marlins Wolf was assigned to Short-Season Jamestown, where in 11 starts, he went 2-4 with a 4.66 ERA, striking out 18 in 46.1 innings. Wolf played 2003 with Single-A Greensboro, where in 27 games, he went 6-1 with a 1.61 ERA, striking out 26 in 50.1 innings. Wolf played 2004 with High-A Jupiter, where in 43 games, he went 11-7 with a 2.60 ERA and 5 saves, striking out 58 in 90 innings, tying for 4th in wins despite not starting a single game. Wolf played 2005 with Double-A Carolina, where in 54 games, he went 5-4 with a 4.96 ERA, striking out 59 in 78 innings. Wolf began 2006 with Carolina, where he pitched in 12 games before earning a promotion to Triple-A Albuquerque in May. He pitched in 48 games with the Isotopes to finish the season. In 60 games in 2006, he went 5-3 with a 4.05 ERA, striking out 41 in 66.2 innings. Wolf opened 2007 with Albuquerque, where he had a 2.82 ERA in 41 games before earning a promotion to Florida. On August 9, Wolf had his contract purchased. He made his major league debut on August 10 against the Mets, pitching 0.1 scoreless innings. On August 25, Wolf was optioned back to Albuquerque, but he didn't stay for long, returning on September 4 after the rosters expanded. He got his first major league strikeout on September 5, against Wily Mo Peña of the Nationals. In 14 games with the Marlins in 2007, he went 0-1 with an 11.68 ERA, striking out 6 in 12.1 innings. After beginning 2008 on the disabled list, he made 3 rehab appearances with Jupiter starting on May 19, and was assigned to Albuquerque at their conclusion. On May 31, he was outrighted off the major league roster. In 41 games in 2008, he went 5-2 with a 3.77 ERA, striking out 27 in 43 innings. After the season, he became a minor league free agent. Baltimore Orioles On December 1, 2008, Wolf signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles.Minor League Transactions Wolf played all of 2009 with Triple-A Norfolk, where in 47 games, he went 4-2 with a 3.95 ERA, striking out a career-high 73 in 82 innings. He signed another minor league deal with Baltimore for the 2010 season. He began 2010 with Norfolk, going 0-2 with a 1.88 ERA, striking out 26 in 38.1 innings before being traded Oakland Athletics On June 22, 2010, Wolf was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Jake Fox. He was assigned to Triple-A Sacramento, where he pitched in 7 games before earning a promotion. On July 7, he was called up by Oakland, replacing Tyson Ross. He made his Athletics debut on July 10 against the Angels. After not pitching since July 29, he was optioned to Sacramento on August 22 when closer Andrew Bailey was reinstated from the disabled list. When the rosters expanded on September 1, Wolf was recalled. In 11 games with Oakland, he had a 4.26 ERA, striking out 9 in 12.2 innings. On October 7, Wolf was outrighted off the roster, and he elected free agency 2 days later. Houston Astros On November 9, 2010, Wolf signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros. Wolf played 2011 with Triple-A Oklahoma City, where in 56 games, he went 4-3 with a 4.76 ERA, striking out 55 in 73.2 innings. After the season, he became a minor league free agent. Return to Baltimore The Baltimore Orioles signed him on January 9, 2012. After playing 7 games with Double-A Bowie, he was released on April 22. Texas Rangers On April 27, Wolf signed a minor league deal with Texas Rangers, and was assigned to Double-A Frisco. After 15 appearances, he was promoted to Triple-A Round Rock on June 12. He bounced between them during June and July before settling with Frisco on July 14. In 50 games in 2012, he went 3-1 with a 3.18 ERA, striking out 58 in 62.1 innings. After signing with the Rangers for 2013, he was assigned to Frisco, making one appearance before being promoted to Round Rock to join their rotation, his first time starting since his professional debut in 2002, excluding one start in 2005. After 6 starts with Round Rock, he was promoted to the Rangers. After scheduled starting pitcher Nick Tepesch had a blister form on his pitching hand, Wolf got the chance to make a start with the Rangers. On May 22, Wolf was called up to start against Oakland, where he gave up 1 run in 5 innings, earning his first career win. Instead of being optioned back to Round Rock, he stayed with Texas in the bullpen. On June 8, 2013, Wolf pitched 6.2 innings of relief in an 18-inning showdown between the Texas Rangers and the Toronto Blue Jays in which he gave up 1 unearned run in the bottom of the 18th inning. He became the fourth pitcher in 50 years to throw at least 6.2 innings with 0 earned runs and get stuck with a Loss. The most recent was current Rangers broadcaster Steve Busby who, ironically, lost to the Rangers in his game. Wolf made more 2 starts in July but was otherwise used in the bullpen. From August to the end of the season, he only appeared in 5 games. In 22 games with the Rangers in 2013, he went 1-3 with a 4.15 ERA and 1 hold, striking out 21 in 47.2 innings. On November 4, Wolf was outrighted off the roster and quickly signed a minor league deal with the Rangers with an invitation to spring training. SK Wyverns On December 13, Wolf exercised an opt-out clause in his contract to pitch with the SK Wyverns of the Korea Baseball Championship.

It is very similar to the perceptron algorithm. However, the perceptron algorithm uses an additive weight-update scheme, while Winnow uses a multiplicative scheme that allows it to perform much better when many dimensions are irrelevant (hence its name winnow). It is a simple algorithm that scales well to high-dimensional data. During training, Winnow is shown a sequence of positive and negative examples. From these it learns a decision hyperplane that can then be used to label novel examples as positive or negative. The algorithm can also be used in the online learning setting, where the learning and the classification phase are not clearly separated. Algorithm The basic algorithm, Winnow1, is as follows. The instance space is X={0,1}^n, that is, each instance is described as a set of Boolean-valued features. The algorithm maintains non-negative weights w_i for i\\\\in {1,\\\\ldots,n}, which are initially set to 1, one weight for each feature. When the learner is given an example (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n), it applies the typical prediction rule for linear classifiers: * If \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i > \\\\Theta , then predict 1 * Otherwise predict 0 Here \\\\Theta is a real number that is called the threshold. Together with the weights, the threshold defines a dividing hyperplane in the instance space. Good bounds are obtained if \\\\Theta=n/2 (see below). For each example with which it is presented, the learner applies the following update rule: * If an example is correctly classified, do nothing. * If an example is predicted incorrectly and the correct result was 0, for each feature x_{i}=1, the corresponding weight w_{i} is set to 0 (demotion step). *: \\\\forall x_{i} = 1, w_{i} = 0 * If an example is predicted incorrectly and the correct result was 1, for each feature x_{i}=1, the corresponding weight w_{i} multiplied by (promotion step). *: \\\\forall x_{i} = 1, w_{i} = \\\\alpha w_{i} A typical value for is 2. There are many variations to this basic approach. Winnow2 is similar except that in the demotion step the weights are divided by instead of being set to 0. Balanced Winnow maintains two sets of weights, and thus two hyperplanes. This can then be generalized for multi-label classification. Mistake bounds In certain circumstances, it can be shown that the number of mistakes Winnow makes as it learns has an upper bound that is independent of the number of instances with which it is presented. If the Winnow1 algorithm uses \\\\alpha > 1 and \\\\Theta \\\\geq 1/\\\\alpha on a target function that is a k-literal monotone disjunction given by f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)=x_{i_1}\\\\cup \\\\cdots \\\\cup x_{i_k}, then for any sequence of instances the total number of mistakes is bounded by: \\\\alpha k ( \\\\log_\\\\alpha \\\\Theta+1)+\\\\frac{n}{\\\\Theta}.

To call originators, it appears that the called party having the FX service is located in the foreign exchange area. It is assigned a telephone number of the foreign exchange. The telecommunication circuit between central offices that implements foreign exchange service has complementary interface types at each end. At the foreign central office that provides the service, the interface is called the foreign exchange office (FXO) end, and at the end where the subscriber station is connected, it provides the foreign exchange station (FXS) interface. Purpose Basic telephony terminology distinguishes two types of offices: local and foreign. A local office is assigned a specific area, and all telephone services provided to that area originate from that central office. Each central office has a unique identifier. Until the 1960s, central offices usually had names, derived from locally distinct geographic or historical contexts. The office names were changed to three-digit numerical central office codes (NXX), prefixed to the local telephone number. Customers who wanted a telephone number provided by a neighboring or remote telephone central office leased a \\"foreign exchange\\" line. With two-wire loop technology, this typically required an engineered circuit with increased costs. The practice, rare except in big cities, is in decline. Foreign central office (FCO) or foreign zone (FZ) services were, from a technological standpoint, deployed with the same methods as foreign exchange (FX). They differ only in that the remote office is in exactly the same rate centre (FCO) or merely in a different zone of the same US metropolitan city (FZ). Much like FX service rates depend on the distance between rate centers, FCO service prices depend on the distance between exchanges.  Function  An FX line has the local calling area of the foreign exchange in which it is numbered.http://cpr.att.com/pdf/oh/0004-0003.pdf A subscriber located just outside the exchange boundary of a large city, or just outside the flat-rate local calling area for the city, would find that many numbers which would have been local from the city itself became long-distance. In many areas, local flat-rate service was subsidized by long-distance toll service for much of the 20th century. As an \\"FX line\\" has a number from the neighboring city, it has the city calling area for both incoming and outbound calls. For instance, a suburban business may want to market extensively to Toronto, a large city with flat-rate local calling: * If the business is in an adjacent suburb (such as Mississauga or Markham) a local number will reach the city but not the suburbs on the other side. Adding an FX line with a Toronto +1-416 number would provide full coverage. * If the business is located just outside the larger city's local calling area, an FX number in the next-closer suburb would provide a limited coverage of the city. An Oshawa business may lease an FX line from suburban Ajax as that community is local to both Toronto and Oshawa, even though Ajax does not have the full Toronto calling area. The \\"FX line\\" is usually treated as part of the distant city when originating calls to N11-style numbers, such as information or emergency telephone numbers. While a cost of hundreds of dollars monthly for the leased line was not uncommon, to a business handling large volumes of calls from the larger city the cost may have been justified by long-distance toll savings at a time when long-distance was pricey and alternatives were limited. Originally, the FX line was a physical copper pair of telephone wires from the foreign exchange which were connected to the local subscriber loop at the local exchange, without passing through the local switch. This dedicated circuit is often replaced with a virtual circuit, where the local switch sends the FX calls to the foreign exchange (which handles all billing) on existing trunks.https://www.google.com/patents/US5757894 In rare instances, the supposed \\"foreign\\" exchange actually resided on the same physical telephone exchange at the same location, but clients were billed based on nominal centre-to-centre distance between different rate centres.http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?switch=TOROON29DS0 and http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?switch=MALTON22CG1 on opposite sides of the Toronto-Mississauga boundary are examples where each exchange serves clients on both sides of a county line using different rate centres. A client in Mississauga requesting a Toronto number would be charged FX line rates, despite the Toronto numbers being on the same physical switch. A similar \\"FCO\\" service provided no difference in local calling area (the distant exchange is in the same rate centre). Historically, it was a means to obtain features not available on the local exchange (such as DTMF tone dialling when first introduced in 1963) or keep an existing business telephone number operational after a cross-town move. Conventional \\"foreign exchange\\" leased lines and their variants have become less common due to newer alternatives: * An outbound \\"extender\\" is an automated local number at a service bureau in the larger city. A suburban subscriber (who can call the city itself locally but is long distance to suburbs on the other side) could call the extender locally, get a city dial tone and dial back out locally to the larger area. * Remote call forwarding served a similar function for inbound calls only. A suburban business could get a downtown big-city number; clients anywhere in the larger city's coverage area could call locally, only to be silently redirected via a second local call to the destination. * Interactive voice response systems have been hosted at answering service bureaux for clients such as suburban radio stations accepting calls from listeners in the larger city. As the machine is on a city number, it is reachable from the full metropolitan calling area. * Mobile telephone exchanges (in countries which use geographic numbers) normally are issued from the larger city and have that city's full calling area. * Voice over IP numbers may be obtained from most cities and used almost anywhere in the world. VoIP renders the subscriber's physical location meaningless, as long as unrestricted broadband Internet is available at the site. Local number portability allows an existing number to be moved to VoIP (or, in some countries, a mobile telephone) which can then be freely moved out of the original geographic location while keeping the directory listing and service area unchanged. A foreign exchange office (FXO) device plays the role of an analog phone Circuit interfaces The circuit that implements the foreign exchange service has two ends, one at the central office that provides the service in the foreign exchange, where the telephone number is assigned, and one at the central office that services the subscriber station. The former is called a foreign exchange office (FXO) interface, and the latter a foreign exchange station (FXS) interface. These two interface types perform complementary functions in signaling. Foreign exchange office The foreign exchange office (FXO) interface is a telephone signaling interface that terminates the foreign exchange line at the central office that provides the telephone number and the call switching for the service. It generates the off-hook and on-hook indications through loop closure and non-closure of a direct current (DC) circuit powered by the serving central office switch. Foreign exchange station The foreign exchange station (FXS) interface is located at the wire center of the subscriber equipment, and supplies battery power and dial tone, and generates ringing voltage toward the subscriber station of the foreign exchange service. Use in voice-over-IP systems Some of the terminology of the foreign exchange service is retained in modern digital packet telephony to indicate whether VoIP equipment is designed to be connected to telephone lines from a central office or to telephone stations. FXO and FXS interfaces are available for computers and networking equipment to interface these directly with plain old telephone service (POTS) systems. An FXO device is any device that, from the point of view of a telephone exchange, appears to be a telephone. As such, it should be able to accept ringing signals, go on-hook and off-hook, and send and receive voice frequency signals. It may use loop start or ground start signaling. An FXS interface is any interface that functions like a standard telephone line jack on the wall. An FXS interface utilizes a line protocol, most commonly loop start, to detect when the terminating device (telephone) goes on-hook or off-hook, and can send and receive voice signals.

Due to a lack of rules regarding eligibility in college football, he played on the team for eight years and was captain for two of them.

According to Yerka, many of the paintings, including \\"Between Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Attack at Dawn\\", draw on his childhood memories from the 1950s as their primary inspiration. Other paintings, such as \\"Amok Harvest\\" and \\"Express Delivery\\", draw on his experiences traveling through the Polish countryside. Yerka was responsible for the title of all but two of the story-paintings, which were named by Ellison.Weil & Wolfe 2002, p. 239 The first of these, \\"Susan\\", was named after Ellison's wife. Ellison also named the painting \\"Ellison Wonderland\\" after one of his short story collections and his home in California because he \\"was hoping that they would give [him] that painting.\\" The painting was later given to Ellison as a gift shortly after the book was published during an interview with Tom Snyder on The Late Late Show. Stories Ellison became involved with Yerka's paintings when he was asked to write an introduction to the Mind Fields collection. According to Ellison, he found the paintings so inspiring that he told his publishers that he wanted to write a story for each one.Weil & Wolfe 2002, p. 238 While Ellison generally based the narrative of each story on some aspect of the painting, this was not always the case. In \\"Attack at Dawn\\" for instance, the story has little to do with the physical objects represented in Yerka's painting. Instead, Ellison chose to base the story on the painting's prominent themes of transformation and attack.Weil & Wolfe 2002, p. 240-241 Ellison also wrote many of the stories to reflect subjects and themes that commonly occur in his work. \\"Twilight in the Cupboard\\" and \\"The Silence\\" both prominently feature the themes of Jewish assimilation and the Holocaust. The former was inspired in part by Ather D. Morse's 1967 book While Six Million Died.Weil & Wolfe 2002, p. 196-197 \\"Eruption\\" and \\"Ammonite\\" embody the lost city/Atlantis theme present in much of Ellison's work. \\"Metropolis II\\" also incorporates themes from many of Ellison's other stories. In particular, it mixes autobiographical details with fiction in a manner similar to \\"All the Lies that are My Life\\" and other stories. Although Ellison did not follow his usual custom of writing an introduction to the book, he did provide commentary on 17 of the stories in the form of endnotes. These notes describe the background to some of the stories, and point out important themes. Yerka's son Philip died during the creation of the book, and Ellison dedicated the final story \\"Please Don't Slam the Door\\" to his memory in one of the notes.

It is organized by the Colombian Cycling Federation. The event is sponsored by Radio Cadena Nacional, which is one of the oldest and largest radio networks in Colombia, and by a network of Colombian business in Medellín \\"Empresas Públicas de Medellín\\". The Clásico RCN and the Vuelta a Colombia are the most important stage races in Colombia. History The first event was held in 1961 and was won by Ruben Dario Gomez. Many well-known Colombian cyclists have won the event, including Martín Emilio Rodríguez, Fabio Parra, Luis Herrera and Rafael Antonio Niño. During the 1980s, the Clásico RCN held several \\"open\\" events in which professional cycling teams from Europe came and competed in the race. It has been written that the reason for this was for Elite professionals in Europe to get altitude training in the early season in Colombia. Some of the teams competing in the Clásico RCN during the eighties included Peugeot-Shell-Michelin, Renault-Elf-Gitane, SEM-France Loire, La Vie Claire, Zor and Reynolds which resulted in stage wins by Pascal Simon, Laurent Fignon, Bernard Hinault, Charly Mottet and Martial Gayant. In the 1992 edition of the Clásico RCN, the and Festina cycling teams competed where Sean Kelly, Claudio Chiappucci, Thomas Wegmüller won stages of the event. In the history of the event, there has been two times when the overall winner was later disqualified for doping. This happened in 1971 when Álvaro Pachón Morales was disqualified, and the win was given to Rafael Antonio Niño, and also in 1991 when Pablo Emilio Wilches Tumbia was disqualified with the win going to Fabio Hernán Rodríguez Hernández. There was a tragic accident in the 1985 edition of the race when Jorge Iván Ramírez fell during a stage and died later. Although the Clásico RCN now occurs in October, past events have taken place in March, April, May and August. It began as a two-day event, but its duration and distance were increased and, in 2000, it consisted of ten stages.

According to Tan, persons affected by this syndrome walk with a quadrupedal locomotion and are afflicted with \\"primitive\\" speech and severe mental retardation. Tan postulated that this is an example of \\"reverse evolution\\" (atavism). The proposed syndrome was featured in the 2006 BBC2 documentary The Family That Walks On All Fours. History The Ulaş family of nineteen from rural southern Turkey has been the primary example of the proposed syndrome. Tan described five members as walking with a quadrupedal gait using their feet and the palms of their hands. In infants, where this is a rare but a normal stage prior and sometimes following bipedal walking, such a gait is called \\"bear crawl\\". The affected family members are also severely mentally retarded and their speech is affected. Tan proposed that these are symptoms of Uner Tan syndrome. In January 2008, Tan reported on another family (four males and two females) located in southern Turkey. Four other unrelated cases in families are described as having various degrees of UTS. Males may be affected more than females. It is also claimed that some individuals are unaware of time, lack language, have severe mental retardation with no conscious experience, and communicate by using sounds. Two males are unable to stand up, while in other cases, can stand up but cannot make a step when standing. Less severe cases use toe walking, which is a normal phase in child gait development.  Genetics  Uner Tan syndrome has been linked to intrafamilial marriage and reproduction, which suggests that it is an autosomal recessive disorder. The main characteristic of this syndrome is habitual quadrupedalism, meaning they can stand up straight until they try to move, then they walk on their hands and knees. According to Tan, the syndrome may be placed in its own category under types of cerebellar ataxias. This simply means it is a type of disorder that involves the cerebellum becoming inflamed, resulting in lack of control of voluntary movements. Uner Tan syndrome falls into this category because it has similar symptoms to other cerebellar ataxia disorders such as Disequilibrium Syndrome (DES-H) and Cayman Syndrome. These symptoms include dysarthria, nystagmus, and hypoplasia of the cerebellum and vermis. Human geneticist Tayfun Ozcelik discovered homozygosity in a region on chromosome 9p24 in Uner Tan syndrome individuals. The very low density lipoprotein receptor gene (VLDLR) is located in this region, which is involved in the migration of neuroblasts within the brain. Ozcelik found mutations in the VLDRL gene in affected individuals, and suggested that these specific mutations may lead to VLDRL deficiency during the development of the brain. This may affect the proper formation of cerebrocerebellar structures critical for upright walking, resulting in quadrupedal locomotion. Other genes may also be involved in habitual quadrupedalism. For example, in some affected families, chromosome 17p13 was involved, while in other families 17p13 and 9p24 had no effect. This suggests the syndrome is genetically heterogeneous. The researchers took a different approach to isolate the gene that causes this syndrome by comparing the genealogy of all the families in which the syndrome had been reported. The two types of Uner Tan Syndrome, UTS type I and type II show genetic heterogeneity. In two of the first families (Antep and Canakkale families) it was the VLDLR gene on chromosome 9p24. This is the only family so far to express homozygosity. It is possible for dissimilar mutations in the VLDLR gene to result in the same phenotype as a result of allelic heterogeneity. In the Iskenderun family, a different gene, WDR81 on chromosome 17p13.1-13.3 was isolated . The Iraqi family had CA8 on chromosome 8q isolated . In the last family studied (the Adana family), the researchers were not able to isolate any gene, only a locus on chromosome 13q. This isolation led to the implication of more genes as the causes of quadrupedalism. The fact that chromosome 9p24 had no effect on some families points to the genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome. Another approach for establishing the genealogy has been to compare UTS with similar syndromes such as disequilibrium syndrome (DES) and Joubert syndrome. UTS seems to be genetically different from DES in that DES can be linked to a single gene, VLDLR, located on chromosome 9p24. When compared with DES, Joubert syndrome has shown links to 7 gene mutations. As is the case with almost all diseases, the three syndromes compared show allelic heterogeneity . Researchers recently isolated a recessive TUBB2B mutation in one of the families diagnosed with UTS. This makes TUBB2B the fifth gene after VLDLR, WDR81, CA8 and ATP8A2, associated with this syndrome. Patients with mutations of TUBB2B are phenotypically similar to those with VLDLR, WDR81 and ATP8A2 mutations. The researchers proposed a tentative reclassification of UTS into three types based on how they present themselves clinically. They attribute the first type (referred to as developmental UTS) to mutations in TUBB2B and VLDLR. Type II (degenerative UTS) is linked to ATP8A2 and WDR81 while type III (UTS without cerebral malformations) implicates CA8. The problem with identifying the specific mutation that leads to Uner Tan syndrome is the fact that different mutations in a single gene can lead to a wide range of phenotypes. In the VLDLR gene, similar mutations may be responsible for different types of cerebellar ataxias that affect proper locomotion in humans.  Criticism  Neuroscientist and evolutionary psychologist Roger Keynes, psychologist Nicholas Humphrey and medical scientist John Skoyles have argued that the gait of these individuals is due to two rare phenomena coming together, not atavism. First, instead of initially crawling as infants on their knees, they started off learning to move around with a \\"bear crawl\\" on their feet. Second, due to their congenital brain impairment, they found balancing on two legs difficult. Because of this, their motor development was channeled into turning their bear crawl into a substitute for bipedalism. Üner Tan and colleagues claim that UTS differs from disequilibrium syndrome.

It is considered by some authorities — including the American Ornithological Society and BirdLife International — to be a subspecies (or even just a colour morph) of the striated heron (B. striata), and was formerly \\"lumped\\" with this species and the green heron (B. virescens) as the green-backed heron. Description The adult is slate-grey to black, which allows it to blend in with the hardened lava. The back feathers typically have a silvery sheen and it has a short crest on its head. When breeding, the heron has a black beak and bright orange legs, but these fade to grey after the breeding season. Distribution and habitat These highly territorial birds are found in intertidal zones and mangrove swamps on all of the islands of Galápagos Province. Behavior Lava heron stalking crabs, Galápagos Islands, Ecuador  Diet  The lava heron stalks small crabs and fish slowly before quickly spearing and eating them. They have also been known to eat the flies that gather near cacti and occasionally smaller birds.  Interactions  These birds have little fear of humans. It has been noted they have flight behaviors, some of which may carry the purpose of territory defense/advertising.  Calls  Lava herons are typically seen hunched over and they have a sharp alarm call (described as a scow sound). During aggressive behavior they will use a skuk-skuk call. Breeding Unlike most herons, these birds nest in solitary pairs for one breeding season in either the lower branches of mangrove trees or under lava rocks. They can breed year-round, though typically from September to March, and can mate up to three times a year and have up to ten eggs each time. References Resources *Heinzel, Hermann and Barnaby Hall.

In active duty Field training exercises are usually practice \\"mini-battles\\" which provide fairly realistic scenarios and situations based on actual situations a unit might face if deployed. While squad and platoon sized units can conduct an FTX, most of these exercises involve units ranging from a company up to a regiment or brigade. Field training exercises rarely reach division strength. The exercise is usually carefully planned out by field grade or general officers, usually without disclosing plans or other information to company-grade officers. This makes the situation more unpredictable and realistic since company-grade officers make the majority of quick and immediate decisions on the battlefield. Nearly every possibility is considered during planning, and often the scenarios can be more difficult or more far-fetched than actual battles, thus sharpening the skills of those participating to a level which will surpass that of the enemy. In basic training All branches of the U.S. Armed Forces implement field training exercises into their basic military training courses for enlistees and officers. In the Army and often in other branches, the last few days of basic training are used to conduct a field training exercise where recruits can practice the skills they have learned over the past several weeks of training. The purpose of this is to give soon-to-be soldiers a taste of battle before they leave basic training. This also allows instructors to look for mistakes and correct them before their recruits become active duty and potentially go to battle. U.S. military examples * The 101st Airborne Division is famous for its field training exercises. Most of its brigades or regiments conduct their own field training exercises annually and the entire division has conducted a division wide exercise on a couple of occasions. These exercises generally consist of the entire unit deploying to the location by parachute (note that the 101st is not an Airborne unit, they only have the Airborne tab because of tradition—they are air assault), followed by multi-day engagements with the \\"enemy\\". * The United States Air Force conducts Operation Red Flag four to six times a year. This is a multifaceted field training exercise consisting of various things such as air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements, mid-air refueling, reconnaissance, close air support, and airlift, as well as special forces and rescue operations.Red Flag (USAF), Wikipedia See also * Red Flag (USAF) * Recruit training * Composite Unit Training Exercise Notes Category:Military education and training in the United States ","title":"Field training exercise"},{"id":"12693910","text":"The mouth of the Maoluo River.

Born in Ballinhassig, County Cork, McCarthy first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team before later joining the under-21 and junior sides. He made his senior debut during the 1986–87 league. McCarthy subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All- Ireland medal, two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team, McCarthy never won Railway Cup medal. At club level he played with Ballinhassig and divisional side Carrigdhoun. Throughout his career McCarthy made 16 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1996 championship. Playing career=Club McCarthy began his club hurling as a goalkeeper with the Ballinhassig under-12 team. He was later moved to the half-back line where he won an under-14 championship medal. For most of his career Ballinhassig operated at junior level, with McCarthy winning several divisional championship medals. Inter-county McCarthy first played for Cork on the minor team on 18 April 1984 in a 1–18 to 3–4 Munster quarter-final defeat of Kerry. He was moved to centre-back the following year before being dropped to the substitutes' bench in his final year as a minor in 1983. In 1986 McCarthy joined the Cork under-21 team, however, his two-year tenure in this grade ended without success. By this stage McCarthy had also joined the Cork junior team. In 1987 he won a Munster medal following a 2–16 to 1–9 defeat of Tipperary. On 25 July 1987 Cork faced Wexford in the All-Ireland decider. A 3–11 to 2–13 score line gave Cork the victory and secured an All-Ireland medal for McCarthy. After making his senior debut in a National Hurling League game in 1987, McCarthy made his senior championship debut on 20 May 1990 in a 3–17 to 3–7 Munster quarter-final defeat of Kerry. He later won a Munster medal that year following a 4–16 to 2–14 defeat of Tipperary. The subsequent All- Ireland final on 2 September 1990 pitted Cork against Galway for the second time in four years. Galway were once again the red-hot favourites and justified this tag by going seven points ahead in the opening thirty-five minutes thanks to a masterful display by Joe Cooney. Cork fought back with an equally expert display by captain Tomás Mulcahy. The game was effectively decided on an incident which occurred midway through the second half when Cork goalkeeper Ger Cunningham blocked a point-blank shot from Martin Naughton with his nose. The umpires gave no 65-metre free, even though he clearly deflected it out wide. Cork went on to win a high-scoring and open game of hurling by 5–15 to 2–21 giving McCarthy an All-Ireland medal. Cork surrendered their titles in 1991, however, McCarthy claimed his second Munster medal in 1992 following a 1–22 to 3–11 of Limerick. On 6 September 1992 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. At half-time Cork were two points ahead, however, two second-half goals by John Power and Michael \\"Titch\\" Phelan supplemented a first-half D. J. Carey penalty which gave Kilkenny a 3–10 to 1–12 victory. McCarthy won a National Hurling League in 1993 following a 3–11 to 1–12 defeat of Wexford after a second replay of the final. He remained a regular on the team until he retired following Cork's early championship exit in 1996.

Born in Timoleague, County Cork, Foley first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Finbarr's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team before later joining the under-21 and junior sides. He joined the senior panel during the 1987 championship. Foley immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All-Ireland medal, two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on one occasion, Foley never won a Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a one-time championship medallist with Carbery, while he also played with Arigdeen Rangers. Throughout his career Foley made 10 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1993 championship. In retirement from playing Foley became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he has worked closely with Bantry Blues. Playing career=College During his schooling at the St. Finbarr's College, Foley established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1984 he won a Harty Cup medal following a 4-9 to 2-7 defeat of Limerick CBS. The game was not without incident as Foley had his jaw broken during that game. In spite of this he still lined out in the All- Ireland decider against St. Kieran's College in the All-Ireland decider on 6 May 1984. Foley played with a faceguard and won an All-Ireland medal following a 1-15 to 0-8 victory. Following his secondary schooling in Farranferris, he attended UCC where he won 4 Fitzgibbon Cup medals , 1985, 1986,1987 and 1988. He captained the UCC freshers team to All Ireland glory in 1985. And was selected on the Combined Universities team in 85,86,87,88 and 89. Club After some success in the lower divisional grades with Argideen Rangers, Foley was a key member of the Carbery divisional team that reached a second successive championship decider in 1994. Midleton, one of the most successful teams of the previous decade, provided the opposition, however, a 3-12 to 3-6 victory gave Foley a Cork Senior Hurling Championship medal. Two years later in 1996 Foley enjoyed major success with the Argideen Rangers club. After securing the divisional junior title Argideen subsequently faced Fr. O'Neill's in the county decider. A 3-9 to 0-11 victory, with Foley scoring 1-2, secured the championship. Inter-county Foley first played for Cork as a member of the minor team on 11 May 1983. He was introduced as a substitute in Cork's narrow 2-13 to 1-15 Munster semi-final defeat by Limerick. After missing the 1984 championship due to a broken jaw, Foley was back the following year as a member of the starting fifteen. A 1-13 to 1-8 defeat of Tipperary secured a centenary year Munster medal. Wexford provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1985. A 3-10 to 0-12 victory gave him an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. In 1987 Foley was a late addition to the Cork junior team that faced Wexford in the All-Ireland decider on 25 July 1987. A narrow 3-11 to 2-13 victory gave Cork the victory and secured an All-Ireland medal for Foley. The following Foley was at full- forward on the Cork under-21 team. He won a Munster medal that year following a 4-12 to 1-7 defeat of Limerick. Cork subsequently faced Kilkenny in the All- Ireland decider on 11 September 1988. Played in St. Brendan's Park, Birr to commemorate the centenary of the very first senior All-Ireland final being played there, Cork triumphed by 4-12 to 1-5, with Foley winning an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. After being included and subsequently omitted from the Cork senior panel in 1987 and 1988, Foley made his senior championship debut on 4 June 1989 in an 0-18 apiece Munster semi-final draw with Waterford. By 1990 Foley was a regular member of the starting fifteen. He won his first Munster medal on that year after a man of the match performance in the decider. Foley's 2-7 contributed to the 4-16 to 2-14 defeat of reigning champions Tipperary. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1990 pitted Cork against Galway for the second time in four years. Galway were once again the red-hot favourites and justified this tag by going seven points ahead in the opening thirty-five minutes thanks to a masterful display by Joe Cooney. Cork fought back with an equally expert display by captain Tomás Mulcahy. The game was effectively decided on an incident which occurred midway through the second half when Cork goalkeeper Ger Cunningham blocked a point- blank shot from Martin Naughton with his nose. The umpires gave no 65-metre free, even though he clearly deflected it out wide. Cork went on to win a high-scoring and open game of hurling by 5–15 to 2–21. The victory gave Foley an All-Ireland medal. Cork surrendered their titles in 1991, however, Foley claimed his second Munster medal in 1992 following a 1-22 to 3-11 of Limerick. On 6 September 1992 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. At half- time Cork were two points ahead, however, two second-half goals by John Power and Michael \\"Titch\\" Phelan supplemented a first-half D. J. Carey penalty which gave Kilkenny a 3-10 to 1-12 victory. Foley won a National Hurling League medal in 1993 following a 3-11 to 1-12 defeat of Wexford. He was dropped from the starting fifteen for the subsequent championship campaign, a move which effectively brought an end to his inter-county career, as he had started a very busy dental practice in Bantry in West Cork which was demanding huge amounts of his time. Inter-provincial Foley was picked for the Munster inter-provincial team in 1988. He was at left corner-forward in the 4-13 to 2-11 semi-final defeat by Connacht. Coaching career In recent years Foley has been heavily involved as a mentor at various levels with Bantry Blues.

As of 2000, the cathedral was the mother church for 289,415Diocese of Laredo; Statistics Catholics in the diocese. History San Agustin Church in 1892 The Villa de San Agustin de Laredo was established in 1755. Its founding residents wanted a Catholic church for a place of worship. The Bishop of Guadalajara, Francisco de San Buena Ventura, ordered the construction of a small mission chapel in 1760 which was the only place of worship until 1778. In 1778, the first stone structure was erected to accommodate more than two hundred families. In 1789, San Agustin was established as a parish by the Bishop of Guadalajara. In 1848 Bishop John M. Odin of the Diocese of Galveston assigned several French priests to this part of his territory. Among them was Allophone Martin Souchon who in 1866 began the construction of the present church. San Agustin Church is a Gothic Revival structure with a five-story- 141 ft (43m) bell / clock tower. All the windows have the traditional Gothic shape with stained glass located between structural bays of its masonry walls. A French priest, Pierre Yves Keralum, was the designer and architect for this historical monument. The new church was opened on December 12, 1872. From 1989 to 1994 the San Agustin Church Historical Preservation and Restoration Society carried out a US$675,000 restoration project. A new Blessed Sacrament Chapel was installed. The whole church was repaired and restored and a brick plaza was created along the front of the church.Diocese of Laredo; San Agustin Church History In 2000 the Diocese of Laredo was established and the San Agustin Church was made its cathedral by order of Pope John Paul II.Diocese of Laredo; History Today, the San Agustin Cathedral is one of the oldest in the Southwest still standing.

It is the largest river in Taiwan by drainage area. The river is long, draining a rugged area on the western side of the Central Mountain Range. Characteristics The Gaoping River headwaters originate near Yushan in northern Kaohsiung’s Tauyuan District and a small part of southern Nantou County. The upper section of the river, known as the Laonong, flows through a series of rugged canyons, through Liouguei and Gaoshu, and is joined by the Zhuokou River. The Laonong emerges from the mountains at Meinong as a wide braided stream and after being joined by the Ailiao from the east, the Gaoping proper is formed, which flows about south along the coastal plain, through Pingtung County, emptying into the Taiwan Strait in Linyuan District. The Qishan River and the Wuluo River flow into the lower section of the Gaoping from north and east, respectively. Headwaters of the Gaoping River With an average annual discharge of , the Gaoping River is the second largest of Taiwan’s rivers by volume, following the Tamsui River. About 90 percent of the precipitation, and consequently about 70–90 percent of the total flow, occurs during the rainy season from May to October. Like many Taiwanese rivers, the Gaoping carries large amounts of silt, ranging from 36 to 49 million tons per year; it is the second largest river in Taiwan (after the Zhuoshui River) in terms of suspended-sediment load. Almost half the total basin has an elevation greater than . Only about 20 percent of the basin is lower than in elevation. The Kaoping River valley is generally considered the boundary between the Alishan Range on the west and the higher Yushan Range to the east. The Gaoping River basin is home to at least 66 fish species, 14 of which are endemic. Cyprinid fish Opsariichthys kaopingensis is named after the river. History During Japanese rule the Gaoping River was known as the . The Japanese colonial government built the Shimo-Tansui Railway Bridge (now known as the Old Gaoping River Iron Bridge), at the time the longest iron bridge in Asia. The bridge was designed by engineer . Due to the unpredictable nature of the river the bridge took eight years to complete, at the cost of 42 lives. On August 27, 2000, flooding damaged a bridge across the Gaoping River causing 16 vehicles to fall into the water, injuring 22 people. In 2009 Typhoon Morakot caused severe flooding along the Gaoping River. About of rain (one year’s typical precipitation) fell over the Gaoping River basin in a period of three days. The river flow peaked at on August 8, and exceeded for a total of nine hours. Several towns along the upper river were destroyed by flooding and landslides, killing up to 500 people. The flow of the river was so strong that it created currents of up to per hour in the Taiwan Strait, damaging or destroying eight submarine cables. Human use The Laonong River tributary in Liouguei, where it would have been diverted to the proposed Meinong Reservoir The Gaoping is one of the few rivers in western Taiwan without a major dam in its basin. However, the river is used extensively for irrigation on the Pingtung plain and its tributaries supply water for domestic and industrial use. The Qishan River tributary is diverted to fill Nanhua Reservoir, which provides nearly 90% of the water supply for Kaohsiung City. In the 1950s the Meinong Dam was proposed as a water supply project for Kaohsiung City. It would have consisted of a large off-stream reservoir in the northern part of Meinong District, with a storage capacity of 328 million m3 (266,000 acre feet) and an annual water yield of 46.2 million m3 (37,400 acre feet). The water would be diverted from the Laonong segment of the Gaoping River within Liouguei District and transported to the reservoir via a tunnel. The project was officially overturned in 2000 by then-President Chen Shui-bian, who stated, “As long as there are alternative ways to supply water to the greater Kaohsiung area, it is not necessary to build the Meinung Dam.” The dam would have flooded an area culturally significant to the Hakka people. The lower part of the river is heavily polluted by runoff from factories and livestock operations, especially from pigs and chickens. A significant amount of contamination originates from the Wuluo River tributary. Up to 65% of the pollution is caused by runoff from swine farms, with another 21% from industry, 13% from domestic waste and 2% from landfills. Transportation TRA bridge crossing the Gaoping River Provincial Highway No. 20, which provides access between Pingtung County and Taitung County, follows the Gaoping River for about between Liouguei and Haiduan Township.

A plant community canopy consists of one or more plant crowns growing in a given area. The crown of a woody plant (tree, shrub, liana) is the branches, leaves, and reproductive structures extending from the trunk or main stems. Shapes of crowns are highly variable. The major types for trees are the excurrent branching habit resulting in conoid shapes and decurrent (deliquescent) branching habit, resulting in round shapes. Crowns are also characterized by their width, depth, surface area, volume, and density. Measurements of crowns are important in quantifying and qualifying plant health, growth stage, and efficiency. Major functions of the crown include light energy assimilation, carbon dioxide absorption and release of oxygen via photosynthesis, energy release by respiration, and movement of water to the atmosphere by transpiration. These functions are performed by the leaves. Crown classes Trees can be described as fitting different crown classes. Commonly used are Kraft's classes.http://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/fhm/posters/posters03/kraft_crown.pdf Kraft designated these social classes based on temperate and boreal forests in Central Europe, so they do not necessarily work with every forest type in the world.

The book is a collection of the editor's favorite stories from all ten issues of her magazine.  History  The cult magazine debuted in May 1997, but took some time to settle into a purely first-person vein. Early issues included straight nonfiction, such as the history of auto-erotic strangulation, and interviews. Eventually, editor Rhoads realized that what interested her most were survivor narratives: \\"There is an undiluted power in reporting what you experienced and testifying about how it changed you. Those are the stories that I like best: the authors' records of When Life Changed. They provide mirrors so that we — voyeurs and survivors in our own rights — can examine our own lives.\\"Morbid Curiosity, issue #10 Morbid Curiosity magazine collected 310 survivor narratives in its ten issues. Contributors probed sexuality, birth, modern healthcare, illicit substances, natural disasters, UFO encounters, humanity’s inclinations toward violence, as well as homicide, serial killers, and ghosts.

Detail of the American Coast Map by Diego Ribero (1529), where the southern half of the east coast of the current United States is named as Tierra de Ayllón The Chesapeake Bay was called \\"Bahia de Santa Maria\\" after the time of Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. Axacan had been called \\"Land of The Saints\\" earlier. The Spanish considered this land to be in their domain. Later, Avilés apparently thought the Portuguese were in the vicinity of the mountains eighty leagues (~240 miles) to the north of the Chesapeake Bay and not a great distance from the channel connecting the bay from the \\"South Sea\\", Gulf of Mexico.March 28, 1568 Brit. Mus. Add. MSS.,33,983,fol.324 Greater Axacan and adjoining Allegheny Mountains' western slopes, Mocosa, to Ajacal (Avacal) was thought to have rivers connecting to the south and west seas at that time. It was due to what the Spanish viewed as trespassing that had brought about the order for the monks to support the Virginia mining efforts. Hernando Moyano and Juan Pardo prospected through the Cherokee range in 1566-67 and barely sufficient reports suggest mining continued into the 1690s along the Appalachian Mountain range. These had routed by land. The explorers had discovered the curiosity of interior oil springs, copper outcrops, iron ore and coal for forging. All of which were located towards the Allegheny Mountains and Unaka Range also in the province of Axacan and the northern areas of \\"La Floridia\\" as spelled on 16th-century Spanish maps.

He was reported to be from Chiskiak town on the York River. In 1559 or 1560, a Spanish vessel, perhaps, with some Dominican friars caused Paquiquino to go with them to Mexico as a guide where Aviles meets Paquiquino and thought to have learnt of the Axacan passage.Hist.

The Viceroy of New Spain had Paquiquino baptised with the name Don Luis de Velasco (Lowery 1905). Ángel de Villafañe had been in the Chesapeake Bay area in 1561. He reported the chief of the Chesapeake area Indians was called Regulus according to Francisco Sacchini.Historia Societatis Fesu, Pars tertia, Romae, MDCIL., p.323, \\"The Spanish Settlements Within The Present Limits Of The United States\\" by Woodbury Lowery At San Mateo, Avilés sent a Captain with 32 soldiers and two Dominican friars to settle the believed route to the mountain pass and rivers that was thought to lead to the Pacific Ocean. This was supposed to have returned Luis to his Chesapeake home and develop a colony at Ajacán landing. But the two friars who had already worked in South America and the military Captain convinced the pilot to navigate back to Europe claiming bad weather for the deviation. Some accounts declare they actually made land-fall, but, were blown off point as they tried to enter the bay. This is how Luis had arrived at Seville, Spain instead of returning to the \\"Bay of Santa Maria\\". Gone for about eleven years, Don Luis had spent the past six years with Aviles. They had returned to winter at Havana by 1570. But, now the concern was about trespassers on his Pacific Ocean passage theory to the China Spice Trade. Meanwhile, it would seem that Luis harboured resentment through the years, although, the reports declare he was eager to help evangelize his kindred.  Segura Mission  Segura Mission 1570 Ajacán landing included Father Segura, vice provincial of the Jesuits with seven companions, Father Luis de Quiros, Brothers Gabriel Gomez, Sancho Cevallos, Juan Bautista Mendez, Pedro de Limares, Gabriel de Solis (related to Aviles), and Cristobal Relondo, a boy named Alonso, and Indian Don Luis departed Santa Elena, just north of St. Augustine (now Parris IslandPart 11: The New World, 11.2 The Spanish and the French (1492-1540), Spanish Conquest of the New World, by George Parris © Copyright 1998), for the Chesapeake Bay on August 5, 1570.Buckingham Smith, \\"Florida MSS., 1526, 1743, p.255, MS. New York Historical Society. They had arrived at Ajacán landing on September 10, 1570. They found the local people had removed themselves from the Ajacán landing area villages due to extended drought of six years. It was reported that only a few old men remained so \\"that they might die where their fathers had died.\\"A quotation cited in Woodbury Lowery in his book The Spanish Settlements Within The Presant Limits Of The United States (1905). Lowery on page 471 lists the \\"scant evidence\\" as to the precise location of the 1570 mission, declaring that it could have been on any of the southern Chesapeake tributaries. Indian crops there at that time was scarce and corn was brought to them. In a brief letter before the ship left the missionaries, Father Quiros wrote of the Allegheny Mountains as told him by the native, of \\"the entrance through the mountains and China...Three or four days journey from yonder, were the mountains, and two of these days' journey were by a river, and one or two days' travel beyond the mountains another sea is observed.\\" Aviles of Spain maintain his theory that the passage to the Pacific was by way of the Chesapeake Bay. The mission called Segura Mission consisted of a hut and small chapel about two leagues, two hours canoe trip up the river of their landing, to Don Luis's brother's village. Don Luis remained with the priests as an interpreter. An expected supply vessel had not returned before winter after which Luis deserted the monks. Within four months, Luis left the missionaries to forage on their own through the winter. Father Rogal wrote of Avales' vengeance on Luis' party who committed the murders on February 8, 1571.Tanner, \\"Societas Militans\\" Pp.449-451 Don Luis's brother saved the boy named Alonso from the betrayal, the only survivor. Avales' is reported not to have punished Luis' brother's village. Father Carrera wrote of the punitive action in 1572 as he had witnessed the Ajacán landing of the delayed supply vessel. Other visitors Waldseemüller map showing North America, originally published in April 1507. Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed along the Atlantic coast in 1524 in the vicinity of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, and was likely the first European to sight it. Captain Vicente Gonzalez sailed around the shores of the Chesapeake in 1588 to the 39th latitude (Annapolis, Maryland). He found and returned evidence to St. Augustine of English at Roanoke. The governor of Florida, Menendez Marques, sailed to the 38th latitude near today's Virginia and Maryland border in 1589. He found Vicente the Indian who claimed he was evangelized at the Segura Mission of Ajacán. Marques allowed him to return to the Florida capital with him. This was after the forming of the Iberian Union. Ajacán Mission The Florida priests built the Ajacán Mission at an unknown location, attributed by some as in the York River (Virginia) vicinity. Historians attribute Spanish abandonment of the Chesapeake Bay to either the Powhatan Confederacy or privateers. Poorly documented seafaring nationals were known to fish and trade at Norfolk Anchorage. Later in the 16th century, many pilots, as the ship's master (today's Captain) was called at that time, held English and French letters of marque to raid the Spanish treasure fleet. English privateers had been sailing to the North American coast since 1562, preying on Spanish shipping loaded with royal loot from the Spanish Main. Their provision and repair anchorage was often at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. This is where the easterly North Atlantic current, just north of the Sargasso Sea moves towards the Celtic Sea of Ireland and Bay of Biscay of northern Spain and Portugal. Father Segura's Ajacán settlement was destroyed by the Native American Don Luis and his group of deceit, \\"Indians\\".Some claim from early printed history such as the following quoth, \\"...Towards the Southwest, four days journey is situate a town called Sequotan, which is the Southernmost town of Wingandacoa, near unto which, six and twenty years past, there was a ship cast away, whereof some of the people were saved, and those were white people, whom the country people preserved. . .\\" Richard Hakluyt, The Principall Voyages, Traffiques, and Discourses of the English Nations (1599-1600), reprinted in Albert Bushnell Hart, ed., American History Told by Contemporaries (New York, 1898), volume 1, 89-95. England's Jamestown Settlement became known to the Spanish at St. Augustine in 1610. These English took the Spanish captive, who were sent by caravel to investigate, in 1611. Although many nationals came to repair or clean their ships' hauls, reprovision and trade or prospect for many decades before, it remains unclear as to who removed the Spanish presence across the mining region of Axacan before the English first permanent colony at Jamestown.

Every year the Lady Knights win championships in Southern California and tournaments around the nation. They have won over 30 SGVL championships, 10 CIF SS championships, and three CIF State Championships. In 2002, the \\"Lady Knights\\" won the National CIF Championship with a record of 33-0 in girls basketball and finished ranked Number 1 in the country. Now the girls basketball team is ranked in the top 50 in the USA and in the top 20 in California. http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/lynwood- knights-(lynwood,ca)/girls-basketball/home.htm Marching Band History Dr. Ronald Savitt began teaching during the later half of the 1970s. Dr. Savitt's predecessor was Robert \\"Bob\\" Smith, who taught at the Bullis Road school from at least the mid 1960s until his retirement and succession by Dr. Savitt. The Savitt Era The LHS band during Dr. Savitt's era, known by its full name as the Lynwood High School Royal Knights Marching Band or The Lynwood High School Royal Knights Regimental Brigade, performed over 25 parades a year. They would travel to Big Bear Mountain in the summer to perform at a parade, march in Los Angeles to help celebrate Chinese New Year, perform three parades in one day to help commemorate the 4th of July, and have performed in the Los Angeles County Fair. The band has gone out of state to perform in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Jazz band took second place in a competition at the Monterey Jazz Festival and the marching band \\"Lynwood High School Royal Knights Regimental Brigade\\" have won first place and sweepstake awards. The marching band has performed at events that did not involve any marching, including the Los Angeles Raiders and Rams games, pre game for the Los Angeles Dodgers, the opening of the I-105/I-710 section of the freeway, Peter Pipers Pizza Bell, Superior Warehouse Lynwood and the opening of Firebaugh High School in Lynwood, CA. In 2006, Dr. Savitt decided to retire Despite any setbacks currently involving the music program in Lynwood High School, it is perhaps the only group that can be said to have the most awards within the school. With trophies numbering well over 300, numerous certificates, donations and a formerly well-known reputation, it is hard for many to imagine this high school without an active marching band.

He is considered an important figure in the development of the 20th- century early music revival and adoption of historically informed performance practices in the United States. Early years Dunn was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota, on December 21, 1925, and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of educator Wendell E. Dunn and younger brother of chemical engineer-inventor Wendell E. Dunn, Jr. He was also the nephew of civil engineer Everett Dunn. He loved music as a child and at about age 11 he was named assistant organist of a Baltimore church. At 16 he became the organist of another local church and was named director of its professional choir not long afterward. He studied at Johns Hopkins University and in 1946 received his bachelor's degree from the Peabody Conservatory, where he studied organ with Virgil Fox and E. Power Biggs. He earned a master's degree at Harvard University in 1948, and then studied at the Amsterdam Conservatory. His harpsichord teachers were Charles Courboin, Ernest White, and Gustav Leonhardt. He studied conducting with Robert Shaw, G. Wallace Woodworth, William Ifor Jones, and Anthon van der Horst. Musical career In the 1950s he was a music director for several churches in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and in 1957 moved to New York City to become music director at the Church of the Incarnation. In 1959, he succeeded Arthur Mendel and Alfred Mann as director of New York's Cantata Singers. He expanded the group's repertoire to include 19th and 20th-century works, but gained notice for presentations rarities from its traditional repertoire, especially Handel's Belshazzar and Rameau's Les Indes galantes. Harold Schonberg assessed a 1959 concert of works by Purcell and Britten with these words: Also in 1959, he launched the ten-year career of the Festival Orchestra of New York. With that group in 1964 he led the New York premiere of Haydn's C Major Cello Concerto, a work discovered in 1961, with Janos Starker. He gained a wider reputation with a series of concerts of works by Bach and Handel at Carnegie Hall in 1961-2. In 1963, he presented Handel's Messiah four times in four different editions, further enhancing his reputation as a conductor of Baroque music. In 1963 Time magazine described him as \\"The hero of the baroqueniks.\\" Dunn appeared as an imposter on the January 31, 1966 episode of the CBS game show To Tell the Truth. He revealed his true identity at the end of the segment. This led to his appointment in 1967 as Music Director of the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, a post he held until 1986. During his tenure there, he transformed the organization from a traditional amateur oratorio society to a fully professional ensemble with a repertoire that ranged from early music to modern works. Michael Steinberg described his work: \\"His performances are clean, transparent, rhythmic and, in a broad repertory from Schütz to Dallapiccola and Stravinsky, he is particularly effective in works with chorus.\\" The New York Times said that his work \\"helped animate the early music revival that took place in the mid-20th century and afterward\\". His ensembles used modern instruments but comprised fewer players; the ensembles' \\"clean, spare sound harked back to 17th- and 18th-century models\\". Published works and later life Many of his editions of choral music were published by E.C. Schirmer in Boston, where he was Editor-in-Chief in the 1970s. He held several faculty appointments at music schools in the U.S., including Boston University, Stanford University, and finally from 1990 to 1999 at the Indiana University School of Music. After his retirement, he devoted himself to writing and mentoring younger conductors. He composed works suitable for small church choirs, described by their publisher, Cantate Music Press, as \\"adaptable to the exigencies and emergencies that are apt to befall Sunday mornings.\\" He died of heart failure on October 26, 2008, in Bloomington, Indiana, and was buried in Green Mount Cemetery.

From the 1980s until 1999, it was a grant-maintained school, and became a foundation school. Today it is an academy. The school has undergone refurbishment under the BSF Building Schools for the Future scheme and a range of new purpose built facilities opened in September 2012. On 9 July 2013 the Duke of Devonshire officially opened the new areas of the school. Traditions The school has two school anthems, Forty Years On and Gaudeamus igitur; both are sung in certain assemblies and at special school occasions. The school strongly believes in traditions and roots; the uniform today is similar to the one worn by the first students, though blazers are worn with the students' chosen house on and the Netherthorpe logo on the skirts. The original buildings, still intact after many years of use, are still actively used. Debating Society There is a Senior Debating Society that has run for ninety-nine years. The meetings of the society are held in the original listed part of the school, built in 1572 and affectionately known as 'the old school' by pupils. Netherthorpe School are the current holders of the Derbyshire Debating Trophy. House System The schools pupils are divided into three houses after the founders; these houses are Sitwell, Frecheville and De Rodes. Throughout the year, pupils compete in inter-house competitions to win the coveted Rose Bowl. A stained-glass window in 'the old school' features the crests of these houses in addition to the Cavendish coat of arms, a previous school house. However, the colour schemes of the De Rodes and Sitwell houses have changed. The Netherthorpe uniform also includes a blazer typically displaying the house badge; the only exception is a highly prestigious award, the Colours, which replaces the house crest with the school emblem. School Colours are awarded for dedication to and leadership within a particular area of the School for a period of 4 years. (This is shorter for those who join the Sixth Form). Prefects In the upper sixth form, there are Head Prefects (head boy and head girl), and respective deputy heads. They form part of the team of Senior Prefects, who have a gamut of roles and responsibilities, such as treasury, charity and international relations. They participate in the annual Boar's Head Carol, an English traditional carol sung at Queen's College, Oxford and Queens' College, Cambridge . Additionally, they manage the group of 50 School Prefects, who assist in lower school.

Among members of the Anglican Communion, private devotional habits vary widely, depending on personal preference and on their affiliation with low-church or high-church parishes. Private prayer and Bible reading are probably the most common practices of devout Anglicans outside church. Some base their private prayers on the Book of Common Prayer. Devotional practices among people and parishes who self-identify as Anglo- Catholic will naturally be different from those Anglicans who are Evangelical. Anglo-Catholics are likely to follow devotional customs familiar to the majority of Christians that have roots in the early and mediaeval periods as well as the contemporary form of devotion. These include daily prayer, particularly the Daily Office, and meditative and contemplative devotions hallowed by the centuries, e.g. the Rosary, the Stations of the Cross and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. Increasingly, Anglo-Catholics are discovering the spiritual riches of Eastern Christianity, e.g. praying with icons and the use of the Jesus Prayer. Evangelical Anglicans have been strongly influenced by the Protestant Reformation and, in some cases, by pietistic, charismatic or Pentecostal habits. Book of Common Prayer The 1596 Book of Common Prayer The Book of Common Prayer was a foundational prayer book of Anglicanism when printed in 1549. The original was one of the instruments of the English Reformation. In addition to the authorized Prayer Book of the Church of England, the book by the tame issued in 1662, many member churches of the Anglican Communion have their own official versions, which may be used by individual Anglicans for their private devotions. Most Anglican churches, however, use contemporary alternatives to the Various editions of the Book of Common Prayer, such as Common Worship (Church of England), or the Book of Alternative Services (Anglican Church of Canada). The liturgies of the Episcopal church in the United States and the Church of Ireland use modern books each of which is named after the Book of Common Prayer. Many devout Anglicans begin and end their day with the Daily Office of a prayer book, which includes the forms for morning, noonday, evening, and bedtime prayer, as well as suggested Bible readings appropriate to each. Some Anglo-Catholics use forms of the Roman Catholic Daily Office, such as the Divine Office, or the forms contained in the Anglican Breviary. The Litany in the Book of Common Prayer, or litanies from other sources, is also a devotion used for private or family prayer by some Anglicans. Quiet Time, a time of prayer and Bible reflection is quite common among evangelical Anglicans, while Lectio Divina, a similar practice, is advocated by more Catholic-minded Anglicans. Veneration of saints The Anglican National Procession to the Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham in the county of Norfolk, England, proceeds through the ruined abbey, May 2003. Although direct prayer to the saints is a practice that was continued in the first Litany in English, it was not particularly encouraged after the English Reformation. It is, however, an important part of Anglo-Catholics' public and private spiritual practices. In Anglo-Catholic theology, veneration is a type of honour distinct from the worship due to God alone. High church theologians have long used the terms latria for the sacrificial worship due to God alone, and dulia for the veneration given to saints and icons. They base this distinction on the conclusions of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (787), which also decreed that iconoclasm (forbidding icons and their veneration) is a heresy that amounts to a denial of the incarnation of Jesus. Prayer is directed to God; one prays with and for the saints as they pray with and for us through Christ to God. Article XXII of the Thirty-nine Articles states the \\"Romish doctrine\\" of the invocation of saints in the 16th century was not grounded in Scripture, hence many low-church or broad-church Anglicans consider prayer to the saints to be unnecessary. One example of Anglo-Catholic veneration is the annual procession in honour of Our Lady of Walsingham (see picture). It was suspended in 1538 and revived in 1922 by some clergy and lay members of the Church of England. Anglican prayer beads Anglican prayer beads The use of Anglican prayer beads (also called \\"the Anglican Rosary\\") by some Anglicans and members of other Christian denominations began in the 1980s. This bead set is used in a variety of ways. Commonly, the beads are used in tandem with a fixed prayer format, but they are also used merely to keep count of whatever prayers the user has chosen for the occasion. For some, the set is carried as a tangible reminder of the owner's faith, with no prayers being said on the beads at all, while some prefer to pray the traditional Dominican Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary instead of or in addition to Anglican prayers. Votive Shrine at the Anglo-Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania) Sacramentals Almost all Christians use sacramentals, whether they are so called or not. Sacramentals among Anglo-Catholics may include images of Christian saints, a cross or crucifix, votive candles, Mary garden and holy water. These are examples of sacramentals the purpose of which are to remind the user of God, or serve as a focus of prayer or meditation. Depending on personal preference, the sacramentals found in an Anglican home will vary. Some will have few visible signs of their faith in the public areas of the home, whereas some will have a prominent Bible or cross in the sightline of any who come through the front door. Some may have a holy water font by their front door, into which the fingers of the right hand are dipped to make the sign of the cross upon entering and exiting the house. Some may also have devotional pictures of Jesus, or of Mary and other saints around the home, or an icon corner, a practice borrowed in recent decades from Eastern Orthodox tradition.

Ruby Lane shops sell items at set prices rather than in an auction format and the company does not take commissions from sales. Each Ruby Lane shop is pre-screened by an in-house team of art and antiques professionals, and must meet specific standards before opening for business. All open shops are required to follow an ongoing, standard set of quality guidelines to help ensure that all items buyers see for sale are genuine and accurately represented.

History Ruby Lane was founded by Tom Johnson and Jim Wilcoxson in 1998 and named in honor of Johnson's mother, Ruby. In 1998, Tom was collecting 1950's dishes and found it cumbersome to complete a set. As the Internet was in its infancy, searching shops online was difficult and often proved fruitless. From there, the idea was hatched to create an easy-to-use online community of shops that showcase quality, pre-screened, antiques and collectibles, finally allowing consumers to find the unique items they sought with ease. In 1999, Ruby Lane along with BiddersEdge and AuctionWatch, were involved in a notable disagreement with eBay over 3rd-party sites indexing eBay listings. In 2005, Wilcoxson departed from the company leaving Johnson as President and CEO. In 2019, Ruby Lane won best Communications, Customer Service (a distinction achieved in seven of the 10 Seller's Choice Awards), and Most Recommended site. Additionally, the site ranked 2nd Overall in 2019. The ECommerce Bytes Sellers Choice is voted on by over 11,500 online sellers. The tagline “Vintage Begins Here” was introduced in 2013.

It is held by the Chief Executive.Cap 1 s 3 Interpretation of words and expressions (INTERPRETATION AND GENERAL CLAUSES ORDINANCE) Prior to the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997, it was known as the Public Seal of the Colony of Hong Kong, used to give authority to official documents and granting Royal Assent in Hong Kong. The Governor was the keeper of the seal. History The Governor of the Crown Colony of Hong Kong had possessed and used a public seal from the foundation of the colony in 1843. Article VI of the letters patent issued to the Governor stated: \\"The Governor shall keep and use the Public Seal of the Colony for sealing all things whatsoever that shall pass the said Public Seal.\\"Public Seal of Hong Kong Description of the colonial seal= 1939-1948 Public seal  Design: Originally created by Mr. B. Wyon, Her Majesty's Medallist in Chief, in 1841, the seal is engraved as follows. In the centre an oval medallion in which is depicted Hong Kong harbour with, in the foreground, a wharf with three people and five bales of merchandise on it; in the middleground, a Chinese junk under sail and a three-masted European-style sailing ship with bare yardarms; and in the background, mountains comprising the Peak District of Hong Kong. The medallion is encircled by a scroll surmounted with the Royal Arms and supporters and bearing the words 'Hong Kong' in the lower portion. Around the lower half of the medallion is a second scroll with the words 'King Defender of the Faith Emperor of India'. Encircling the whole are the words 'George VI by the Grace of God of Great Britain Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas'. On the side the seal bears the hallmark of the Royal Mint. Holders: When this seal was introduced the Governor was Sir Geoffry Alexander Stafford Northcote who held the post from 28 October 1937 until 10 September 1941. He was followed by Sir Mark Aitchison Young whose tenure was interrupted by the occupation of Hong Kong by Japan on 25 December 1941. Sir Mark resumed his governorship following the defeat of Japan in August 1945. He was succeeded in turn by Sir Alexander Grantham on 25 July 1947 who was governor when the public seal was replaced.  1948-1952 Public seal  Design: Following Indian independence the previous year, a Royal Proclamation issued in 1948 gave notice that the words 'Emperor of India' were to be omitted from all instruments bearing the Royal Style and Title. In October 1948 the seal was withdrawn from use and replaced by another of a similar design but with the Royal Style and Title amended. Holder: Sir Alexander Grantham  1952-1997 Public seal  Seal from 1952 - 1997 Design: Queen Elizabeth II succeeded King George VI as the Queen of the United Kingdom. The Public Seal was revised to the current Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom with the Royal Style and Title amended. Holders: Sir Alexander Grantham, Sir Robert Brown Black, Sir David Clive Crosbie Trench, Sir Murray MacLehose, Sir Edward Youde, Sir David Wilson and The Rt. Hon. Chris Patten At the midnight hour of 1 July 1997 when British sovereignty over Hong Kong ended, a junior Executive Council official removed the Public Seal and formally defaced it with a ragged cross, using a chisel. Under the Public Records (Access) Rules, the public can request to see government documents where contents were made available to the public and older than 30 years old. Currently, one of the metal seals used between 1939-1948 is viewable at the Government Records Service, located at the Hong Kong Public Records Building.

The film focuses primarily on the last several weeks of writer Joan Vollmer's life in 1951 Mexico City, leading up to her accidental killing by her husband, the writer William S. Burroughs. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000 and was entered into the 22nd Moscow International Film Festival. Plot In 1944 New York City, beat writers and students Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Lucien Carr, William S. Burroughs, and David Kammerer all become acquainted with Joan Vollmer, a student at Barnard College. Joan and William carry on a romance. Lucien murders David after David makes unwanted sexual advances on him. Lucien visits Joan and William at their apartment after and confesses to the murder, claiming David had an obsession with him, and attempted to rape him in a park. Lucien ultimately serves two years in prison for the crime. By 1951, Joan and William are married and living in Mexico City with their young son, William Jr., and Julie, Joan's daughter from her previous marriage. Joan is unhappy with her life in Mexico, as William carries on an affair with a male lover, Lee, to her chagrin. William leaves to Guatemala to meet Lee for a romantic liaison, avoiding an impending visit from Lucien and Allen who are traveling from New York. Upon Lee and Lucien's arrival, Joan and Lucien visit a local bar together, where Joan expresses her unhappiness over her marriage to William. Joan, Lucien, and Allen plan a weekend trip to visit the Parícutin volcano. Meanwhile, William, having met with Lee in Guatemala, finds Lee evasive and unwilling to be physically affectionate with him. When pressed, Lee suggests he feels that William only uses him for sex. Joan, Lucien, and Allen travel through rural Mexico en route to Parícutin, camping along the way. Allen tries to convince Joan to return to the United States with him and Lucien, but, despite her unhappiness with her marriage, she does not want to abandon William, as she sees his potential. Joan also adds that William fears returning to the United States due to a pending heroin possession charge there. Sexual tension quickly develops between Joan and Lucien on the trip, but she rejects his numerous advances. The three return to Mexico City from their weekend trip. Lucien and Allen implore Joan to return to New York with them, bringing her children along with, but she refuses. Willam returns from his trip to Guatemala, and he and Joan discuss the possibility of separating. Lucien and Allen's car breaks down near the Texas border, leaving them stranded. Lucien hitches a ride back to New York City, leaving Allen alone until the car is repaired, as he has to report to his new job at United Press International. Meanwhile, Lee arrives in Mexico City and visits William and Joan at their apartment. After a dinner in which alcohol is consumed, Joan is outwardly passive-aggressive toward Lee. To entertain themselves, William suggests that he and Joan perform their \\"William Tell\\" parlor trick, in which he attempts to shoot a shot glass off the top of her head with a pistol. Joan perches a glass atop her head and goads William, who misfires the gun, shooting her in the head and killing her. Shortly after, while Lucien is working at the United Press International office, he receives a telegram notifying him of Joan's death. CastHistorical accuracy Scholar Michael J. Prince notes that, in the film, \\"broad liberties are taken with the relationship between Lucien Carr and Joan, and much is imputed to Allen Ginsberg's unrequited love for Carr; lastly, Joan is portrayed as downright vindictive and insulting when chiding her husband about his sexual proclivities.\\" Comparing the film's treatment of Joan to that of David Cronenberg's in Naked Lunch (1991), he concludes: \\"Even though it ends tragically, [director] Walkow is doing for Joan what Cronenberg has done for William but without the saturation of so much of his own visual character... no one is shown writing more than her in the film... She is bright, alluring, and reflective.\\" While the film depicts Vollmer leaving her two children behind during her trip to Parícutin with Ginsberg and Carr, in reality, Vollmer brought the children along. Production=Filming Principal photography of Beat took place in Mexico City in the summer of 1999. The apartment building which Vollmer and Burroughs are shown residing in the film was located across the street from the actual apartment building the couple shared, and in which Vollmer was killed. Walkow had initially sought to shoot in the original apartment, but upon arriving in Mexico City to scout locations, discovered the building had recently been demolished. Post- production Originally, Walkow intended to structure the film chronologically into to two separate acts, with the first documenting Vollmer and Burroughs' meeting in 1944 New York City, and the second on their life in 1951 Mexico City. However, he instead decided to present the 1944 backstory in the form of flashbacks, with Ginsberg narrating. Release Beat premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 29, 2000, and was subsequently entered into the 22nd Moscow International Film Festival. Critical response Christopher Null of Contact Music wrote: \\"Judy Davis might have commanded the definitive Joan Vollmer role in Naked Lunch, but in Beat, Courtney Love makes a not-half-bad at reinterpreting the last weeks of her life... A loving portrait of the early beat lifestyle, Gary Walkow's ode to Vollmer is sweet and endearing, despite its tragic finale. The four lead players all imbue their characters with substanial flair, especially Sutherland's mannered and deadpan witticisms.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety gave the film a middling review, deeming the dialogue pretentious and adding: \\"Modestly mounted feature has adequate production design by Rando Schmook and some pretty Mexican landscape lensing by Ciro Cabello. But staging, pacing, score, et al are uninspired to tedious.\\" Film Threat wrote: \\"Generally fine performances help keep the film afloat through several tedious moments of angst-overdose, although Sutherland has a disconcerting tendency to play Burroughs as if channeling Jack Nicholson. Beautiful photography, aided by Mexico’s rugged beauty as natural set dressing, also help. In the end, however, none of these people, except, perhaps, for Ginsberg, come across as particularly likable, at least as written here.\\" Ron Epstein of the website DVD Talk gave the film an unfavorable review, writing: \\"It's a shame that Beat is a bad movie. The turns from present to flashback are very stylish, and overall, the acting isn't bad. Hell, even Courtney Love does a pretty good job with what she's been dealt with. Unfortunately, the script doesn't allow for developed relationships between the characters; and feels very hollow when it's all said and done.\\" J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader criticized the casting of Love in the role of Vollmer, as he felt Love was to glamorous to portray \\" a plain, brunette bookworm and alcoholic.\\" Home media Lionsgate released Beat on VHS and DVD in 2002 featuring a shortened cut of the film, running 80 minutes as opposed to the original 89-minute cut shown at the film's Sundance premiere.

She gained the majority of her fame working for World Championship Wrestling, before joining Extreme Championship Wrestling.  Career = World Class Championship Wrestling and Universal Wrestling Federation  Hyatt's professional wrestling career began in 1985 when she was hired by World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). She was the manager of John Tatum, whom she was dating at the time. She was embroiled in a feud with another valet in WCCW, Sunshine. This rivalry culminated into a mud-pit match at Texas Stadium in 1986. Eventually, Hyatt and Tatum left for the Universal Wrestling Federation. At this time, Eddie Gilbert was the leader of \\"Hot Stuff International,\\" a group that included Sting and Rick Steiner. Hyatt formed an alliance with his group and it was renamed \\"H & H International, Inc\\". It was not long before Hyatt and Gilbert started an affair that caused problems with Tatum. Hyatt left Tatum for Gilbert in 1987, and they split up on screen as well. She married Gilbert in 1988.  World Wrestling Federation  While still under UWF contract, Hyatt was contacted about working for the World Wrestling Federation. Vince McMahon wanted Hyatt to replace Rowdy Roddy Piper and his segment, Piper's Pit, with a new segment called \\"Missy's Manor.\\" \\"Missy's Manor\\" segments were taped on March 21 and 22, and April 23, 1987. Despite having big name stars on her segment such as \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage with Miss Elizabeth, The Honky Tonk Man and Harley Race, the show was considered a disappointment, and McMahon asked Hyatt to become a Federette, which were the ring girls shown at pay-per-views. She thought the role was beneath her, and she went back to the UWF.  World Championship Wrestling  In 1987, when the UWF was purchased by the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions, Missy and Eddie came along. Missy was used as a commentator, conducting her debut interview with Sir Oliver Humperdink on the December 31, 1988 edition of World Championship Wrestling on TBS, and then eventually as the manager for Gilbert and The Steiner Brothers. She eventually returned to her role as commentator and hosted WCW Main Event, and soon was engaged in a feud with fellow commentator, Paul E. Dangerously. The feud led to various competitions between the two, including an arm wrestling match at the Clash of the Champions XIV: Dixie Dynamite on January 30, 1991, in which Hyatt defeated Dangerously. A contributing factor to her victory might be that Hyatt had removed her jacket to reveal her low-cut top as the ref started the contest. Missy would engage in a battle over who the \\"First Lady of WCW\\" was with The Dangerous Alliance's Madusa, with Hyatt narrowly winning a Bikini Showdown at the 1992 Beach Blast pay-per-view event. While in WCW Hyatt made an appearance in the IWA at ringside during a match between The Bushwhackers and The Thunderfoots. Hyatt returned to managing in 1993, with an association with The Nasty Boys. She also briefly managed The Barbarian. During a match, Hyatt jumped off the ring apron and her breast popped out of her top. When she went to the WCW offices the next day, they allegedly had a blown-up picture of it on the wall. Hyatt complained to her boss at the time, Eric Bischoff. Bischoff did not take action, so Hyatt went over his head, to his boss. As a result, Bischoff released her. She then decided to file a lawsuit against WCW for sexual harassment, and for overdue payments for her time doing a 1-900 hotline for the company. Bischoff, however, claimed that Hyatt was fired on February 8, for her behavior and jealousy over the signing of Sherri Martel.  Extreme Championship Wrestling  In 1996, Hyatt joined ECW.  Independents  When Hyatt left ECW, she still worked for various independent promotions. She has worked for Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU) at all of their events in New Jersey since April 2007. She often hosts her interview segment, Missy's Manor. On April 2, 2016, at the 2016 Wrestlecon, Hyatt managed Lance Storm in what was advertised as her final professional wrestling appearance. In the match, Storm was defeated by Matt Hardy, managed by Reby Sky.

It belongs to the municipality of Santa Uxía de Ribeira and is integrated in the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park. It is separated from the mainland by a distance of about 3 kilometers to the north. It occupies about 190 hectares and has a maximum height of 71 meters (As Gralleiras). Almost the entire perimeter of the island is rocky but has three beaches of fine white sand. Since 2001 it has been integrated into the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park. Today, the island of Sálvora forms part of the civil parish of Aguiño (Riveira municipality). Previously the island depended on the civil parish of Carreira, which was for centuries the richest and most populous parish in the comarca, also the oldest. In March 2007 the island was acquired by Caixa Galicia for 8.5 million euros. Later that same year the Ministry of Environment exercised its right of refusal, buying Sálvora, Vionta and Noro for the same amount. The Board of Galicia, which is the owner of the island since July 1, 2008, in conjunction with the Ministry of Environment, have started work to rehabilitate the enclave. History In the year 899, King Alfonso II donated the island to the Cathedral Chapter of Santiago, who claimed it in order to obtain resources for their livelihoods. This grant, which included Ons, Tambo, Arosa, Cies and Framio, was confirmed by Ordoño to the Bishop Sisnando. In 1120 the island had already been invaded by Saracen ships who took refuge in the island waiting for reinforcements as they prepared to invade the land. The delay of that helped make the Christian ships sent by order of the archbishop of Santiago seized by the invading ships that stopped for a long periods of time. Thereafter, this unknown island began to be coveted by the nobility of the time.

Promoted to captain, from 6 November 1943 to 7 August 1944 he commanded the large carrier . During his tenure on Essex, Ofstie was involved in several naval actions. Essex took part in her first amphibious assault at the Battle of Tarawa. Her second amphibious assault delivered in company with Task Group 58.2 was against the Marshall Islands in January to February 1944. As part Task Group 68.2 Essex participated in the attack against Truk, Operation Hailstone, in February 1944. Essex struck Marcus and Wake Islands in May 1944 and finally deployed with Task Force 58 to support the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the occupation of the Mariana Islands in June 1944. Escort Carrier Commander and Battle off Samar In August 1944 Ofstie was promoted to rear admiral and was assigned as Commander Task Group 32.7/Carrier Division 26 with his flag in the escort carrier for the invasion of Palau in September. Keeping his flag in Kitkun Bay, Carrier Division 26 moved to the Philippines to support the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Ofstie was assigned to Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague's Task Unit 77.4.3 code name \\"Taffy III\\" where his unit was heavily involved in the Battle off Samar. Pitted against a Japanese naval force consisting of 4 battleships, 6 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, and 11 destroyers, led by Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, Ofstie's COMCARDIV 26 escort carrier was sunk by Japanese naval gunfire.

On 11 October 1949, Rear Admiral Ofstie testified before a committee and stated, \\"strategic air warfare, as practiced in the past and as proposed for the future, is militarily unsound and of limited effect, is morally wrong, and is decidedly harmful to the stability of a post-war world.\\" These comments were related to the \\"Revolt of the Admirals\\".

It is also one of the earliest sites of Bengal, where significant amount of Hindu statues were found. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. It dates from a period to the nearby Halud Vihara and to the Sitakot Vihara in Nawabganj Upazila of Dinajpur District.  History  A number of monasteries grew up during the Pāla period in ancient India in the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, comprising Bengal and Magadha. According to Tibetan sources, five great Mahaviharas stood out: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious; Somapura Mahavihara; Odantapurā; and Jaggadala. The monasteries formed a network; \\"all of them were under state supervision\\" and there existed \\"a system of co- ordination among them ... it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions,\\" and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them. Xuanzang of China was a noted scholar who resided at the Somapura Mahavihara (the largest monastery in ancient India), and Atisa traveled from Bengal to Tibet to preach Buddhism. The earliest form of the Bengali language began to the emerge during the eighth century. The excavation at Paharpur, and the finding of seals bearing the inscription Shri-Somapure-Shri- Dharmapaladeva-Mahavihariyarya-bhiksu-sangghasya, has identified the Somapura Mahavihara as built by the second Pala king Dharmapala (circa 781–821) of Pāla Dynasty. Tibetan sources, including Tibetan translations of Dharmakayavidhi and Madhyamaka Ratnapradipa, Taranatha's history and Pag-Sam-Jon-Zang, mention that Dharmapala's successor Devapala (circa 810–850) built it after his conquest of Varendra. The Paharpur pillar inscription bears the mention of 5th regnal year of Devapala's successor Mahendrapala (circa 850–854) along with the name of Bhiksu Ajayagarbha. Taranatha's Pag Sam Jon Zang records that the monastery was repaired during the reign of Mahipala (circa 995–1043 AD). The Nalanda inscription of Vipulashrimitra records that the monastery was destroyed by fire, which also killed Vipulashrimitra's ancestor Karunashrimitra, during a conquest by the Vanga army in the 11th century. Over time Atisha's spiritual preceptor, Ratnakara Shanti, served as a sthavira of the vihara, Mahapanditacharya Bodhibhadra served as a resident monk, and other scholars spent part of their lives at the monastery, including Kalamahapada, Viryendra and Karunashrimitra. Many Tibetan monks visited the Somapura between the 9th and 12th centuries. During the rule of the Sena dynasty, known as Karnatadeshatagata Brahmaksatriya, in the second half of the 12th century the vihara started to decline for the last time. One scholar writes, \\"The ruins of the temple and monasteries at Pāhāpur do not bear any evident marks of large- scale destruction. The downfall of the establishment, by desertion or destruction, must have been sometime in the midst of the widespread unrest and displacement of population consequent on the Muslim invasion.\\" A copperplate dated to 159 Gupta Era (479 AD) discovered in 1927 in the northeast corner of the monastery, mentions donation of a Brahmin couple to Jain Acharya Guhanandi of Pancha-stupa Nikaya at Vata Gohli, identifiable as the neighbouring village of Goalapara  Architecture  Site map The quadrangular structure consists of 177 cells and a traditional Buddhist stupa in the centre. The rooms were used by the monks for accommodation and meditation. In addition to the large number of stupas and shrines of various sizes and shapes, terracotta plaques, stone sculptures, inscriptions, coins, ceramics etc. have been discovered. The site houses the architectural remains of a vast Buddhist monastery, Somapura Mahavihara, covering . It was an important intellectual centre for Dharmic Traditions such as Buddhists (Buddha Dharma), Jains (Jaina Dharma) and Hindus (Sanatana Dharma) alike. The complex has 177 cells, viharas, numerous stupas, temples and a number of other ancillary buildings. The outside walls with ornamental terracotta plaques still display the influence of these three religions. In acreage, Somapura was the largest of the mahaviharas. According to Sukumar Dutt, the complex was dominated by a temple, which was strongly reminiscent of Hindu-Buddhist temples of Burma, Java and Cambodia, reproducing the cruciform basement, terraced structure with inset chambers and gradually dwindling pyramid form ... during the age of the Palas some sort of intercourse between eastern India and south-east Asia existed.\\" Another commented, \\"there can be no doubt that this style of architecture has most profoundly influenced that of Burma, Java and Cambodia. The nearest approximation to the plan and the superstructure of the Paharpur temple is afforded by the temples known as Chandi Loro Jongrang and Chandi Sevu of Prambanam in Central Java.\\"  Central temple  The purpose of this central structure at the midst of the courtyard remains unsolved since its discovery. Hence, most of the debates generated hitherto on the architecture of Sompur Mahavihara are cantered on the identification its missing superstructure. The reason may be manifold, but the most important one is the non-availability of substantial amount of first-hand resource including a comprehensive architectural documentation at the disposal of the researchers. There are different arguments regarding the terminating top of the central structure of Sompur Mahavihara. Consequently, most of works done so far are mainly based on the findings of the archaeological excavation and studying the artefacts from the archaeological perspective. The first study on this monument with documentation was by archaeologist K. N. Dikhist in his Paharpur, Memoirs of Archaeological Survey in India (1938). Dikhsit was concerned with documentation of the archaeological findings and concentrated on their interpretation and analysis. He attempted to suggest a probable architectural treatment of the missing parts of the structure through studying the archaeological remains. Till today, this study is considered as the most authentic record of the Sompur Mahavihara. Prudence R. Myer published the first of such studies in 1969 as a journal paper, in which he proposed the missing superstructure as a stupa and illustrated the possible three- dimensional articulations. Myer embarked on his proposal through a diachronic study of the stupa and stupa shrines in India. He took Sompur Mahavihara as an example to elaborate his study and did a conjectural restoration of the central structure in support of his analysis. The second work was published around thirty years after Myer's proposition. A team of architectsTeam members were Md Ali Naqi, Ziaul Islam, Md. Shoeb Bhuiyan and Catherine Daisy Gomes from Khulna University led by Mohammed Ali Naqi has proposed another theoretical reconstruction of the central structure as well as some parts of the peripheral block (mainly the entrance hall) in 1999. This work was also presented in the \\"International Seminar on Elaboration of an Archaeological Research Strategy for Paharpur World Heritage Site and Its Environment\\" jointly organised by UNESCO and Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh in 2004. Muhammad Ali Naqi proposed a temple-like spire at the top by considering the central mound as a 'Stupa-Shrine' with a 'Shikhara' type stupa in his reconstruction. = Popular media by Paharpur Bihar = Many videos documentary have been Paharpur Bihar, 2016 Eid special Teli film Chader shohor Onair By Channel i. directed By Razib Hasan Cast By Satabdi owudut, mithila, tarq shopon, full of stories and cinematography of around Paharpur Bihar.

The terracotta artworks in the site have suffered from serious damage as a result of \\"lack of proper maintenance, shortage of manpower, fund constraint and heavy rainfall And the major problem is the corruption of Bangladesh.\\" Furthermore, poor water drainage accompanied by high levels of salinity in the soils has contributed to decay the terracotta sculptures. Other threats include uncontrolled vegetation, vandalism, climate conditions, and public trespassing and encroachment.

In Oregon, he served as a pastor for several churches, helped found what would become Pacific University, and pushed for legislation to create a public school system in Oregon Territory. The Massachusetts native later served as the county schools superintendent in Clackamas and Multnomah counties. Early life The Reverend George Atkinson was born on May 10, 1819, in Newburyport, Massachusetts.Corning, Howard M. (1956). Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 14. After attending Bradford Academy and Newbury Academies, he then moved to Hanover, New Hampshire. There he attended Dartmouth College where he graduated in 1843. Atkinson then received religious training at the Andover Theological Seminary, graduating in 1846. He married Nancy Bates that same year. On February 24, 1847, George Atkinson was ordained as a Congregational minister and then sent with his wife as a missionary to Oregon Country. The couple sailed on the ship Samoset around South America’s Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands. From there they voyaged on the vessel Cowlitz to the Columbia River where they arrived in 1848. Oregon Portrait of Atkinson in later years Upon arrival the family settled at Oregon City, Oregon as the first Oregon missionary sent by the American Home Missionary Society On June 21, 1848, Atkinson was given charge of the Congregationalist Church in Oregon City, which would not build a church building until 1850.AMC Chronological History.

George Atkinson would serve as minister for 15 years at the church, and helped to found the Clackamas County Female Seminary. He also helped to found Tualatin Academy in Forest Grove along with Tabitha Moffatt Brown and Harvey L. Clark. Atkinson had been given instructions by the missionary board to start an academy before leaving for Oregon.Horner, John B. (1919). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. The school was incorporated on September 29, 1849, and Atkinson served as a trustee of the school that would later become Pacific University. Also in 1849, Atkinson pushed for laws to create public schools, earning him the title of \\"Father of Oregon schools\\" by educators.History. Oregon Education Association. Retrieved on February 18, 2008. He proposed that education should be at no cost to students with financial support coming through taxes, a permanent fund to provide financing should be established, control of the schools should be at the local level, the schools should allow religious freedom, and teachers should be certified to meet professional standards.Oregon History Project: Education, Arts, and Letters: Establishing a Framework for Learning.

He made his first appearance on 8 October 2007. It was announced on 19 July 2008 that Davro quit the show to do other projects. He made his final appearance on 1 December 2008. Storylines Vinnie is first seen in Walford after he knocks over Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) with his car when she is on her way to court. Vinnie offers to take her to hospital but she wants to be in court for her son, Deano Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). Vinnie goes with her and then takes Shirley to hospital and later offers a lift home along with Shirley's friend, Heather Trott (Cheryl Ferguson). When they get home, Vinnie gives his phone number and address to Shirley and tells her to telephone him if she needs anything. Shirley pretends to be more injured than she really is, telling Heather, \\"where there's blame, there's a claim\\". Vinnie goes on to work Shirley's shift at The Queen Victoria public house, so she can get her normal wages even though she is unable to work due to a neck injury, but Vinnie withholds her wages unless she agrees to go on a date with him. Shirley refuses, but Vinnie gives her the money anyway along with his phone number. He turns up again a few weeks later when Heather phones him and, although Shirley isn't impressed at first, he wins her over with a bottle of wine and they go on a date. It is later revealed that Vinnie has a daughter named Hayley, although Heather thinks Vinnie is having an affair when she hears him talking to her on the phone. Shirley breaks up with Vinnie but they decide to get back together. Vinnie waits for Shirley at the underground station but her watch breaks and she turns up late, and he had got on the train before she arrived. He returns in April 2008 as he realises that he is in love with Shirley. He spends all his money on a deposit on a flat in Walford and begs Shirley to move in with him, forcing her to choose between him and current love interest Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). When Phil shows no inclination of taking things further, a reluctant Shirley agrees to Vinnie's proposal and they begin living together. Over the next few months, Vinnie gets a job as a taxi driver at the firm run by Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) and helps organise a Best of British day at the pub when Shirley is left in charge. Despite all this, however, things begin to deteriorate in his relationship with Shirley. Over the next few months, Shirley finds herself more in love with Phil and less in love with Vinnie. She spends less time with him, constantly going clubbing with Heather, and when Vinnie tries to be romantic by booking them a holiday, Shirley retaliates by taking Heather in his place. After she forgets his birthday, Vinnie finally confronts her, resulting in Shirley revealing her true feelings for Phil. This leads to the end of their romance as Vinnie throws Shirley out of the flat, making her homeless. He later relents and gives her the keys to the flat, moving in instead with his mates Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) and Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi). The following month, Vinnie returns from a holiday with Garry and Minty to find that his son Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan) has arrived in Walford and is squatting in their flat. During their conversation, it is revealed that Vinnie had lost touch with Callum over the years due to his extramarital affair which caused the breakdown of his marriage to Callum's mother. Vinnie and Callum put their differences behind them and Vinnie allows Callum to stay. Vinnie soon begins to feel that his life in Walford is pointless, so when an old friend offers him the chance to travel across the world in a vintage car, he immediately accepts the offer. Seeing that his ex- girlfriend Shirley is now down on her luck as Phil has a new girlfriend, Suzy Branning (Maggie O'Neill), he invites Shirley to come along with him. The couple rekindle their relationship and make their exit from Walford on 1 December 2008. However, prior to them leaving, Vinnie learns that the night before Phil and Shirley had had a one-night stand. With this thought weighing him down Vinnie stops the car just outside Walford and tells Shirley to return to Albert Square as by staying with him she'd only be settling for second best. As Shirley makes her way back home, Vinnie is last seen driving off alone to catch a ferry to France. On 6 March 2009, before departing for good from the Square, Callum mentions that he is on his way to visit Vinnie. It is then revealed that Vinnie and Callum are living in Southend. In January 2012, Shirley contacts him after Phil is imprisoned and he agrees to send some work to The Arches.  Character creation and development =Background and casting Vinnie Monks was introduced by the executive producer of EastEnders, Diederick Santer. The character, described as \\"a loveable rogue\\", was brought in as a love interest for the character Shirley Carter (played by Linda Henry) in October 2007. The role was given to Bobby Davro, known to the British audience as a 1980s comic, impressionist, and a 1990s children's TV presenter. Davro has revealed that he auditioned for the role on the advice of actress Barbara Windsor, who plays landlady Peggy Mitchell: \\"It’s through her really that I got this chance.\\" Bobby Davro was said to be \\"chuffed\\" when he got the part. He has commented: \\"EastEnders is a high-profile show, but I'm already used to the attention which being on telly brings […] I love the part and I’m learning. I’m still trying not to look straight at the camera, that’s the entertainer in me! Everyone has just been fantastic […] This is so exciting for me. I want to go in and really work hard and see myself get better […] I’ve never really acted before…I’m enjoying learning the trade.\\" Davro is one of several comedians or comic actors to be given a role in EastEnders, a tradition that goes back to 1987, when comedian Mike Reid was cast as Frank Butcher. The casting of a comedian in a dramatic role was highly controversial at the time, but over the years the wisdom of that decision was proved, as Frank became one of the show's most popular and iconic characters. Other comic actors featured in EastEnders include Barbara Windsor (known for her roles in Carry On films) as Peggy Mitchell, and entertainer Shane Richie, who played Alfie Moon. Vinnie has been described as a \\"chip off the old block\\" from former characters such as Frank and Alfie, with reports even claiming that he is being used as Alfie's replacement. Davro has commented on the comparison between his character and Shane Richie's character, Alfie: \\"Shane and I are big pals, we go back 20 years. We have the same sort of background and that’s probably why comparisons are being made. I don’t like that idea because Shane was such a good asset to the show. It puts a lot of pressure on me […] If [Vinnie] could be half as successful as Alfie Moon then I’d be well chuffed […] [Shane Richie] gave me some great advice…he told me to listen to the other actors and to learn your lines properly. That has helped so far…\\" Personality Vinnie has been described as \\"a cheeky chap\\", a charmer, with a lot of old-fashioned values; the sort of person who would not do anyone an injustice. Davro has said \\"he’s a very sensitive bloke is Vinnie, He’s a bit scared of commitment, scared of getting hurt [...] I model him on a friend of mine, David, and also on Vince from [the BBC sitcom] Just Good Friends.\\" Departure Davro quit the show in July 2008, saying he wanted to pursue other projects. He reportedly said he wished to appear in the show from time to time, saying \\"I have had a fantastic year with EastEnders and made lots of friends. I hope to be back at some point.\\" However, in December 2009, it was reported that Davro had quit because he found the role boring, saying \\"I wish it could have been longer. But the writers didn't develop him as much as I wanted and I got bored.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional taxicab drivers Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Vinnie Monks"},{"id":"12694458","text":"The Cristur (also: Valea Cristurului or Cârjiți) is a left tributary of the river Cerna in Romania.

In Vermont, the route extends for along the western side of the state as a mostly two-lane rural road, with the exception of an expressway section between Bennington and East Dorset. US 7 is known as the Ethan Allen Highway for its entire length through the state. US 7 ends at an interchange with Interstate 89 (I-89) in the town of Highgate, just south of the Canadian border. I-89 continues to the border crossing. Route description Original-style Vermont US 7 shield View north along \\"Super\\" US 7 in Sunderland US 7 crosses the Massachusetts–Vermont state line at Pownal, from where the road heads north to Bennington as a rural two-lane highway. Just north of downtown Bennington, the highway transitions into a limited-access highway. For , US 7 is a true expressway with divided carriageways and multiple lanes. The road subsequently narrows down to an undivided two-lane freeway; however, many stretches have passing lanes. This continues to a point just north of Manchester, where US 7 reverts to a surface road. Most of US 7 between Manchester and the Canadian border is an undivided, uncontrolled road varying in width from two to four lanes. Two divided highway sections also exist: a section south of Rutland, and a stretch with numerous traffic signals between Shelburne and South Burlington known as Shelburne Road. There is overhead signage at the junction with I-189 in South Burlington that directs northbound trucks onto I-189. While US 7 heads directly into Burlington, I-189 bypasses the city to the south and east and leads directly to I-89, which runs close to US 7 north of Winooski. Near downtown Burlington, US 7 intersects with US 2; the latter route joins US 7 for more than to Colchester. From here, US 7 and I-89 run through northern Vermont to Highgate, where US 7 ends at the northernmost exit on I-89. History US 7 was assigned in 1926. Interstate 89 was originally envisioned to parallel US-7 from the Massachusetts border to the Canadian frontier. This plan was ultimately cancelled, and I-89 was shifted to its current alignment, turning southeast at Burlington toward Montpelier and White River Junction. Prior to the cancellation of the original I-89 routing, approximately of freeway (mostly \\"Super 2\\" with some four-lane sections) was built in the US-7 corridor between Bennington and Manchester, plus an additional of four-lane highway between Wallingford and Rutland were completed.

Cyphophthalmi comprises 36 genera, and more than two hundred described species. The six families are currently grouped into three infraorders: the Boreophthalmi, Scopulophthalmi, and Sternophthalmi. Description Cyphophthalmi are smaller than the more familiar \\"daddy long- legs\\" harvestmen, with adults ranging from 1 to 7 mm in length. Moreover, their legs are relatively short compared to most other harvestmen, typically shorter than the body. Some superficially resemble mites, which is where they get their common name. Their coloration is almost always some shade of brown, with a heavily sclerotized body, and they are quite inconspicuous, residing in leaf litter or in caves. Many Cyphophthalmi are eyeless, and presumably rely on olfactory cues to find food and mates. Very little is known about their behavior, though they likely subsist mostly by scavenging and preying on minute arthropods. They have low dispersal rates and consequently high endemism.Cyphophthalmi Research page at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology Diagnostic features Cyphophthalmi differ from other harvestmen in a number of key ways. Like all harvestmen, they have a pair of ozopores located on the sides of the prosoma. Unlike other harvestmen, however, the ozopores in Cyphophthalmi are located on elevated cone-shaped structures known as ozophores. Although members of most families are eyeless, most members of the families Pettalidae and Stylocellidae do have eyes located on or near the ozophores. These eyes, however, are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen, and are instead derived from ancestral lateral eyes, instead of ancestral median eyes, as is the case for other harvestmen. The male genitalia of Cyphophthalmi is unique among harvestmen, as males lack a true penis, and instead have a short spermatopositor, a structure which is not inserted inside the female, but used to deposit a spermatophore. In addition, they are the only harvestmen to lack a genital operculum, and instead exhibit a completely open gonopore. Mating in Cyphophthalmi is not well studied, but in some species at least, males and females do engage in direct contact. They further differ from most harvestmen in that the first 8 opisthosomal tergites and the prosomal carapace are fused together in what is known as a scutum completum, although this feature is also known from the unrelated family Sandokanidae. Sexual dimorphisms Like most animals, Cyphophthalmi express morphological distinctions between male and female individuals. Male Cyphophthalmi possess a structure on their fourth pair of tarsi known as an adenostyle. The adenostyle usually appears as a small hornlike projection, but can take a variety of shapes, depending on species. The function of the adenostyle is currently unknown, but is presumably associated with chemical glands. Aside from the adenostyle, males in many species possess glandular pores on either the underside of the opisthosoma or the anal region, although these glands are not present in all species. Males in several families also possess structural modifications of the anal plate and males of certain species in the family Stylocellidae possess a modified patch of cuticle near the adenostyle known as the Rambla's organ. The exact function of these glands and structures is currently unknown. Chemical defenses Like most harvestmen, Cyphophthalmi rely heavily on chemical secretions for defense. This defensive character is particularly well developed in Cyphophthalmi, when compared to the more familiar Eupnoi and Dyspnoi. Cyphophthalmi possess more elaborate musculature associated with the defensive glands than other harvestmen, and the secretions, which primarily consist of a variety of napthoquinones and ketones, are thought to be more potent than in Eupnoi and Dyspnoi. Distribution Cyphophthalmids are found on all continents, with the exception of Antarctica, where they probably also once lived. As they did not disperse onto any oceanic islands, and it is believed that they did not travel between separate landmasses, they make an interesting subject for biogeography. Each of the six currently recognized families has a distinct distribution: * Stylocellidae: found from India to New Guinea * Ogoveidae: found exclusively in West Africa * Neogoveidae: found in Neotropical ecosystems between Florida and Ecuador, and in western equatorial Africa * Pettalidae: found in South America, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand, demonstrating a Gondwanan distribution. * Sironidae: found in temperate Europe, North America, and Japan, demonstrating a Laurasian distribution * Troglosironidae: found exclusively in New Caledonia. Colombia shows the largest diversity of cyphophthalmids among countries in South America. This could reflect the large number of ecosystems found there, but could also be due to a high rate of sampling in this country. Fossil record A fossil cyphophthalmid assigned to a modern genus, Siro platypedibus Dunlop & Giribet, 2003 (Sironidae), was described from the Oligocene Bitterfeld amber of eastern Germany. A slightly older representative of this genus was described from Eocene Baltic amber as Siro balticus Dunlop & Mitov, 2011. A third fossil, Palaeosiro burmanicum Poinar, 2008, has been described from the Cretaceous (Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber. It was also assigned to Sironidae but is now thought to belong to Stylocellidae (a more typical Asian family).Dunlop, J. A., Penney, D. & Jekel, D. 2014. A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives. In Platnick, N. I. (ed.) The world spider catalog, version 15.0 American Museum of Natural History, online at http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/index.html As the fossil record for Cyphophthalmi is so sparse, recent studies have attempted to predict the diversification time of the suborder by using molecular clocks and comparing gene sequences among living taxa. One 2012 study estimated the earliest diversification of the suborder at approximately 332 MYA, in the Carboniferous. Another study, in 2014, recovered a diversification age of approximately 340 MYA. A more recent study in 2017, however, recovered the diversification of the modern Cyphophthalmi lineages to have occurred more recently, during the Jurassic, with the emergence of the suborder as a whole at less than 300 MYA. Relationships Cyphophthalmi is one of the two major lineages of harvestmen; the other, containing the Laniatores, Dyspnoi and Eupnoi, is known as Phalangida.Shultz, Jeffrey W. & Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo (2007): Morphology and Functional Anatomy. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 15ff The extinct suborder, Tetrophthalmi, shares several features in common with Cyphophthalmi, and these two suborders may represent sister taxa. They are grouped into the following infraorders: Boreophthalmi, Scopulophthalmi, and Sternophthalmi. The Boreophthalmi and Sternophthalmi together form a monophyletic clade, and comprise 5 of the 6 families of Cyphphthalmi. The Scopulophthalmi, with only 1 family, the Pettalidae, forms the sister group to all the other families. Within the Sternophthalmi, the families Ogoveidae and Neogoveidae are most closely related, and form the superfamily Ogoveoidea, which is the sister group to the family Troglosironidae. The systematics of the Boreophthalmi, however, is not yet fully resolved. In one recent analysis, the Boreophthalmi were recovered as paraphyletic with respect to the Sternophthalmi. Even within the Boreophthalmi, the Sironidae has been recovered either as sister family to Stylocellidae, or as paraphyletic with respect to Stylocellidae. In addition, there are 3 genera of Cyphophthalmi with uncertain affinities that have not been placed in any family or infraorder. Taxonomy=History of taxonomy Originally, Cyphophthalmi was recognized as a single family consisting of two subfamilies, Sironini and Stylocellini. This classification scheme existed until 1980, when a new taxonomy was proposed, separating 5 families into the now-defunct infraorders Temperophthalmi (consisting of Petallidae, Sironidae and, later, Troglosironidae) and Tropicophthalmi (consisting of Stylocellidae, Ogoveidae and Neogoveidae). These two infraorders were never recovered as monophyletic in subsequent studies, and, following a 2012 phylogenetic analysis, a new Cyphophthalmi taxonomy was proposed. Current taxonomy The Cyphophthalmi are currently represented by the following taxa, which represent approximately 200 species, although there are a significant number of undescribed species that have been collected, and the current number of species is believed to be a severe under-representation. The monophyly of most subgroups of Cyphophthalmi is well supported, although both Boreophthalmi and Sironidae have been recovered as paraphyletic in recent analyses. * Cyphophthalmi incertae sedis *::* Ankaratra franzi Shear & Gruber, 1996 *::* Marwe coarctata Shear, 1985 *::* Sheargovea mexasca Giribet, 2011 * Infraorder Boreophthalmi Giribet, 2012 ::* Family Sironidae Simon, 1879 (7 genera, 57 species) ::* Family Stylocellidae Hanson and Sørenson, 1904 (6 genera, 36 species) * Infraorder Scopulophthalmi Giribet, 2012 ::* Family Pettalidae Shear, 1980 (10 genera, 75 species) * Infraorder Sternophthalmi Giribet, 2012 ::* Family Troglosironidae Shear, 1993 (1 genus, 13 species) :* Superfamily Ogoveoidea Shear, 1980 :** Family Neogoveidae Shear, 1980 (8 genera, 27 species) :** Family Ogoveidae Shear, 1980 (1 genus, 3 species) See also * Harvestman phylogeny * List of Cyphophthalmi species FootnotesFurther reading * * Dunlop, Jason A. & Mitov, Plamen G.

The river is navigable by vessels with a draft of up to the village of Kumai on its right bank, from the entrance to the bay, and for further upstream. The depth at Kumai, a small river port with a government station and a landing pier at the custom house, is . Kumai Port is in West Kotawaringin Regency, from the capital, Pangkalan Bun, and is used for export of palm oil produced in the province. Environment Water volumes vary during the year, with highest volumes during the Northwest Monsoon. At some times of year the river contains relatively little mud. The river shows traces of salt water as high as upstream. The river runs through tropical lowland forest for most of its length. Near its estuary the vegetation is mainly nypa and mangrove. The peat forest surrounding the Kumai River suffered from droughts and fires in 1982–83 and again in 1997–98. The Tanjung Puting park, about half of which is peat swamp forest, is famous for a population of about 4000 orangutans. It is accessed from Kumai by speedboat down the Kumai River and then up the Sekonyer River to Camp Leakey, a journey that takes about 1.5 hours. The Kumai River forms the northern border of the Tanjung Puting park. Beyond that the peat forest has been removed to make way for oil palm plantations.

She was also an opponent of the use of alternative medicine treatments of HIV in place of scientifically tested methods. More recently, Madlala-Routledge served for a short period as the executive director of Inyathelo: The South African Institute for Advancement until March 2015 when she resigned following problems with the board. Early life and education Born on 29 June 1952 in Magog, Umzumbe, Nozizwe Charlotte Madlala is a South African of Zulu descent and a Quaker. She was brought up by her single mother in what was formerly the Zulu Kingdom, now the southern region of the province of KwaZulu-Natal. After schooling at Magog Primary and Fairview Primary, she matriculated at the Inanda Seminary School in Durban. She went on to study medicine at the University of Natal but was distracted by Steve Biko of the Black Consciousness Movement who involved her in student politics. After completing her first year, in 1971 she transferred to the University of Fort Hare to study for a B.Sc. Once again coming under Biko's influence, she ran into trouble in 1972 for participating in a student boycott. Refusing to apologize for her behaviour, she was dismissed. In 1991, she earned a diploma in adult education from the University of Natal. During her studies, she compiled a manual on Lay Care for the Elderly and wrote easy readers in the Zulu language for newly literate adults. She also obtained a diploma in medical technology, resulting in six years employment as a medical laboratory technologist. After a long interruption, in 2006 Madlala-Routledge took up her studies once more. In 2010, she graduated from the University of Cape Town in social science, with majors in philosophy and sociology. Political career Madlala-Routledge joined the underground African National Congress in 1979 and in 1983, she participated in establishing the Natal Organisation of Women, becoming its first chair. After a prolonged period of imprisonment without trial, including a year in solitary confinement, she joined the South African Communist Party, first as regional chair in Natal, later as a member of its central committee. In 1990, following the unbanning of political organisations, she became a member of the executive committee of the Women's National Coalition. She also contributed to the work of the sub- council on the status of women and helped to prepare policy on the empowerment of women under the Reconstruction and Development Programme. In 1993, she won a seat in the country's revamped parliament. On 17 June 1999, Madlala- Routledge became the first woman in South Africa to be appointed Deputy Minister of Defence. She held the post until April 2004, when she became Deputy Minister of Health. In that capacity, she strove relentlessly for more effective measures to combat AIDS which at the time was spreading rapidly and causing up to a thousand deaths per day. More than five million South Africans or 12% of the population were reported to be infected with HIV. She was strongly opposed by the minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang who preferred to rely on African treatments such as garlic, beet root and African potatoes rather than modern drugs. Dismissal as Deputy Minister of Health On 8 August 2007 on the eve of National Women's Day, Madlala-Routledge was removed from office as Deputy Minister of Health by President Thabo Mbeki.President Mbeki relieves Deputy Minister of Health, retrieved 10 August 2007President Mbeki sacks deputy health minister retrieved 10 August 2007 There was some speculation as to the specific reason of her dismissal at the time, given certain speculative elements.

The next day she was officially dismissed. Her sacking was criticized by opposition parties and AIDS organisations. The Treatment Action Campaign commented: \\"This is a dreadful error of judgment that will harm public healthcare.\\" Background of dismissalClashes with the Health Minister over HIV/AIDS= The dismissal had come after a long period of repeated public clashes with the Minister of Health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang over national HIV/AIDS policy. =Conflicting reports over Frere Hospital= The two ministers had also released conflicting reports over the conditions of the maternity ward at Frere hospital, in the Eastern Cape province. Madlala-Routledge had reported that conditions at the maternity ward were a 'national disaster'. This was contradicted by Msimang, who reported that her deputy's comments were based on 'untruths', that the mortality rate at the hospital had been exaggerated, and that the infant death rates were 'in line with the national average'. These events were preceded by an exposé in the Daily Dispatch newspaper over the allegedly appalling conditions at the hospital. Madlala-Routledge first paid a visit to the hospital, which had not been scheduled nor communicated to the hospital, and after her report, Msimang subsequently paid a scheduled and announced visit to the hospital. Finally, writing in his weekly column, president Thabo Mbeki had defended Msimang's report on Frere Hospital and downplayed the Daily Dispatch's investigations as inflammatory, effectively dismissing the deputy minister's views.Letter from the presidency, Volume 7, No. 29, accessed 10 August 2007 ='Unauthorised' trip to AIDS conference in Spain= Madlala-Routledge travelled to an international AIDS conference in Spain, which had received approval from the necessary departments but had been forwarded to the President for approval and thus, Presidential approval had not been granted at the time she made the trip. Ultimately, President Mbeki declined authorisation of the trip, which happened when she was already en route to Spain. Upon arrival, and being informed of the declination, Madlala- Routledge cancelled her visit to the conference and travelled home immediately. In a press conference after her dismissal, Madlala-Routledge stated that it is common for ministers to travel without receiving an approval answer from the presidency because ministers often leave at such short notice. Political career following dismissal In December 2007, she was elected to the ANC's National Executive Committee in 33rd place.Brendan Boyle, \\"Winnie Mandela tops ANC election list\\" , The Times (South Africa), 21 December 2007. From September 2008 to May 2009, she was deputy speaker of the National Assembly, after which she remained a member of parliament. Madlada-Routledge was appointed a parliamentary caucus chair of the African National Congress in 2008 but left the following year to study Social Science at the University of Cape Town, graduating in 2010. That year she became a co-founder of Embrace Dignity, a human rights organisation fighting sex trafficking and sexual exploitation. The organisation proposes that sex work itself be decriminalised, but that clients of sex workers become criminally liable. In April 2014 she launched the \\"Vote No\\" campaign alongside fellow ANC member and former government minister Ronnie Kasrils. The campaign aimed to encourage people to cast protest votes or spoilt ballots in the 2014 general election as a protest against Jacob Zuma and the perceived corruption of his government. In June 2015 she became executive director of the South African Institute for Advancement (Inyathelo) but resigned in March 2016, protesting the payment of a golden handshake to one of the organisation's founders. Personal life Madlala-Routledge is married to Jeremy Routledge whom she met in the early 1980s. They have two sons, Martin and Simon.Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge retrieved 12 August 2007 She resides in Cape Town.

It featured a Powers Dry Goods store, Woolworth, JCPenney, and Red Owl Grocery Store. The center was enclosed in 1980 and Montgomery Ward added to the eastern side. Powers became Donaldson's and then Carson Pirie Scott. In 1994, the Carson's store closed and was torn down for a Kohl's. Montgomery Ward closed its store in the mall in 1998, and one year later, Cub Foods opened in its place. The eastern wing of the mall was vacated in 1999 for a movie theater multiplex which never opened. Five years later, TJ Maxx relocated from an existing store within the mall to the east wing, opening a combination TJ Maxx/HomeGoods store in its place. JCPenney closed in 2000. In 2014, plans were announced to remove the remaining portion of enclosed mall between Kohl's and TJ Maxx/HomeGoods.

The band released concept albums in post-prog and symphonic progressive metal genres with orchestral arrangements and heavy use of keyboards. Its music is strongly influenced by film score composers like Danny Elfman, and its lyrics are based on fantasy, gothic and science fiction stories. The band split in 2009, however, its members since released a number of side projects. History Mechanical Poet was founded in 2002 as a studio project by ex- members of Russian avantgarde act Glazemaker Lex Plotnikoff and Tom Tokmakoff. For a few years the band known as Glazemaker was working on creating a \\"sound\\" of their own, till they evolved a sound which was a mixture between melodic metal with progressive metal riffs and symphonic orchestrations using electronic instruments. In 2003, Sebastian Trifonoff left the band and was soon replaced by Epidemia frontman Max Samosvat. With the new singer the band released its first EP, Handmade Essence. After the EP the band received several offers from various music companies, and finally signed a record deal with Italian label Aural Music In 2004, the debut album Woodland Prattlers, was released. Though the album had sold well, the union of Plotnikoff, Tokmakoff and Samosvat split in 2005 due to artistic disagreements. In 2006, the Mechanical Poet returned with a new line-up: singer Jerry Lenin (ex-4 Tarakana, Lady's Man), guitar player Lex Plotnikoff, drummer Vladimir Ermakoff (also Black Obelisk) and bass player Serge Khlebnikoff. In this line-up the band made their first ever live show (Plan B Club, Moscow, 04/08/2007) and released their third album Creepy Tales For Freaky Children (with session work of Epidemia bass player Ivan Izotov). The album had simpler arrangements with a more post-prog sound, something that was not accepted well by many metal fans of the band. Nevertheless, the album was highly acclaimed by punk and alternative rock audience. The album had bonus tracks in Russian, which was the first time the band had Russian songs. After the release of the album, Serge Khlebnikoff left Mechanical Poet. In 2007, the band released another concept album, Who Did It To Michelle Waters? A double album telling a story about a suicide of a girl and the circumstances that led her to that. The double album consisted of two parts, Music From And Inspired By The Original Sad Story and Original Score. The bass session player on the album was Daniel Zakharenkoff (a member of Black Obelisk). 2008 saw band with new vocalist, Vladimir Nasonoff, and a new concept album Eidoline: the Arrakeen Code, based on Frank Herbert's Dune series. The album was well received by Russian media: Mir Fantastiki magazine rated it 9 out of 10 and named it the best sci- fi/fantasy concept album of 2008; Dark City magazine awarded it with 4 stars out of 5. On June 7, 2009, Mechanical Poet played their last show featuring ex-singers Max Samosvat and Jerry Lenin and announced they were going on indefinite hiatus. Since then, several side projects from the band's members appeared, including Luna Damien by Plotnikoff and Lenin, Sunburst by Samosvat and Nasonoff, Hattifatteners, Last Fighter and Mistland Prattlers by Plotnikoff. On March 1, 2017, PLotnikoff announced in the official VK community that Mechanical Poet is recording a new album called The Midnight Carol That an Imp Has Sought. The release, however, was delayed indefinitely due to Plotnikoff's health problems.

He was an AFL All-Star in 1961. He showed up to the training camp after being signed by a free agent in 1960 by the Boston Patriots. He was kept on the team by coach Lou Saban and started as a guard on the offensive line. In his rookie season as a Patriot, he was named second all-pro. Always striving to do better after being drafted for a short career in the United States Army, he was named first all-pro in 1961. In 1962, he played four games before he severely tore his hamstring in a non-football related accident. Unable to get the injury to heal so he could return to his prior playing level, he did not return to the Patriots offensive line and was let go by the team. In 1963, his coach in Boston, Lou Saban, again invited him to try out for his team, only it was for the Buffalo Bills not the Boston Patriots. Even though coach Lou and he got along very well, he was cut by the coach before the season started officially ending his career.

Within the state of Idaho, the freeway travels for from the Washington border near Spokane to Coeur d'Alene and the panhandle region at the north end of the state. After traveling through the Silver Valley along the Coeur d'Alene River in the Bitterroot Range, I-90 crosses into Montana at Lookout Pass. I-90 was created by the federal government in 1957, following the general route of U.S. Route 10 (US 10) and the mid-19th century Mullan Road constructed by the U.S. Army. The freeway was constructed in stages between 1960 and 1992. Route description Interstate 90 enters Idaho at a crossing of the Spokane River in the community of State Line in Kootenai County, approximately east of Spokane, Washington. The freeway travels northeast through the Rathdrum Prairie and into the outskirts of Post Falls, passing several retailers and a business park along the Spokane River. I-90 continues east along the river, paralleled to the south by the North Idaho Centennial Trail and a section of the BNSF Railway, and passes near the eponymous Post Falls and the city's downtown, served by a signed business route. The freeway intersects State Highway 41 (SH-41) and continues through the city's eastern residential neighborhoods and passes the nearby town of Huetter. I-90 then reaches Coeur d'Alene, the largest city in northern Idaho, and intersects a business route and US-95, the state's main north–south highway, near the Kootenai Medical Center. The freeway travels around the north and east sides of central Coeur d'Alene, intersecting several local streets in the process, and turns southeast towards Fernan Lake and Lake Coeur d'Alene on the Spokane River. I-90 ascends Potlatch Hill and makes several stair-step turns to follow the northern shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene while traversing several forested hills. It passes over a valley overlooking Bennett Bay on the Veterans Memorial Centennial Bridge, a high concrete bridge that was completed in 1987. The freeway descends from the hills and travels southeasterly along Wolf Lodge Bay, passing Coeur d'Alene Parkway State Park and intersecting the northern terminus of the Lake Coeur d'Alene Scenic Byway (SH-97) at the east end of the lake. I-90 continues east along Cedar Creek into the Coeur d'Alene Mountains, part of a national forest, and reaches Fourth of July Summit at an elevation of . Wallace in 2007 From the summit, I-90 continues southeast along Fourth of July Canyon towards the Coeur d'Alene River valley and intersects SH-3 near Rose Lake. The freeway bends northward around a hill and travels east into the river valley, passing Cataldo and the Old Mission State Park, home to the state's oldest standing building. In Cataldo, it also crosses the river and the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes, a major rail trail that follows the highway into the Bitterroot Range. I-90 crosses into Shoshone County, one of only two counties along the highway within Idaho, and continues along the north sides of Pinehurst and Smelterville, passing the Shoshone County Airport at the latter. The freeway travels southeasterly through Kellogg, passing the Silver Mountain Resort and its ski gondola, and continues around the towns of Osburn and Silverton along the north bank of the South Fork Coeur d'Alene River at the bottom of the narrow Silver Valley. I-90 also intersects a set of business routes in Osburn and Silverton that loop back to the freeway. The freeway turns east in the town of Wallace, also served by its own business route, and travels to the north of downtown on an elevated viaduct cut into a nearby hill. At the east end of Wallace, I-90 intersects SH-4, which connects to the ghost town of Burke. The highway continues along the south side of the river and Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes as it ascends further into the mountains and meanders around hills and gulches. The trail ends at the town of Mullan, named for road-building U.S. Army captain John Mullan and home to a business route, and I-90 continues east along the Northern Pacific Trail. The freeway travels uphill from the river along a southern ridge and passes a scenic viewpoint commemorating the 1903 Willow Creek avalanche.https://history.idaho.gov/wp- content/uploads/2018/08/Idaho-Highway-Historical-Marker-Guide.pdf I-90 then turns south and leaves Idaho at Lookout Pass, elevated above sea level and located adjacent to the Lookout Pass Ski and Recreation Area. The freeway continues into Montana and travels through the cities of Butte, Bozeman, and Billings. I-90 is the only Interstate in northern Idaho and a major east–west route, forming part of a transcontinental highway. At , it is the second- shortest mainline Interstate in the state, after Interstate 86, and the third- longest. The entire highway was designated as the Purple Heart Trail by the state legislature in 2008. The Idaho section of I-90 is maintained by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), which conducts an annual survey of traffic on certain highway segments that is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. Traffic volumes on I-90 ranged from a minimum of 7,861 near Mullan and 60,729 in Huetter on an average day in 2017. History Interstate 90 from Coeur d'Alene to Lookout Pass roughly follows the route of the Mullan Road, constructed in 1859–60 by the U.S. Army and civilian volunteers led by captain John Mullan. Mullan received a series of appropriations from U.S. Congress from 1855 to 1860, totaling $230,000, to build the first engineered road west of the Mississippi River and connect Fort Walla Walla to Fort Benton. The road also followed the Coeur d'Alene River and its south fork, which was long used by the Coeur d'Alene people to visit hunting grounds in modern-day Montana. Other sections of I-90 were built over the Yellowstone Trail and U.S. Route 10, though some parts of I-90 were cut as new roadway. The link from Post Falls to the Washington state border was completed in 1972 at a cost of $1.1 million to upgrade the existing road and build a new bridge over the Spokane River. The small town of Wallace in the Silver Valley still prides itself on having what was the last stoplight on I-90. Its downtown has many historical buildings, which would have been wiped out by the original planned route of the freeway, so in 1976, city leaders had the downtown placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Alternatives discussed in 1963 included tunnels and twin levels. As a result, the federal government was forced at great expense to reroute the freeway to the northern edge of downtown and elevate it. Work on that section was resumed in 1984, and it opened in September 1991.Idaho Transportation Department A bicycle path is routed beneath part of that segment. Before the move to the viaduct, I-90 went from a freeway at the western edge of Wallace, then turned to surface streets and followed the main arterial as U.S. Route 10 through town, which included the last stoplight on I-90 between Seattle and Boston. Upon reaching the eastern edge of the town it became a limited access divided highway once again. The interstate also was routed along Lake Coeur d'Alene as a surface street before the Veterans Memorial Centennial Bridge was completed in 1992, traveling further above the lake.

SparkNote on Shelley's Poetry. 18 August, 2007. Background The poem was composed in 1819, but it was not published until 1839 in the four-volume The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley (London: Edward Moxon) edited by Mary Shelley. Like all sonnets, \\"England in 1819\\" has fourteen lines and is written in iambic pentameter; however, its rhyming scheme (a-b-a-b-a-b, c-d-c-d, c-c-d-d) differs from that of the traditional English sonnet (a-b-a-b, c-d-c-d, e-f- e-f, g-g). Summary The sonnet describes a very forlorn reality. The poem passionately attacks, as the poet sees it, England's decadent, oppressive ruling class. King George III is described as \\"old, mad, blind, despised, and dying\\". Chandler, James. England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, 1998. The \\"leech-like\\" nobility (\\"princes\\") metaphorically suck the blood from the people, who are, in the sonnet, oppressed, hungry, and hopeless, their fields untilled. Meanwhile, the army is corrupt and dangerous to liberty, the laws are harsh and useless, religion has lost its morality, and Parliament (the \\"Senate\\") is a relic. In addition, the civil rights of the Catholic minority are non-existent \\"Time's worst statute unrepealed\\". In a startling burst of optimism, the last two lines express the hope that a \\"glorious Phantom\\" may spring forth from this decay and \\"illumine our tempestuous day\\". This poem was written as a response to the brutal Peterloo Massacre in August 1819. \\"England in 1819\\" first appeared in the four-volume The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Moxon, London, 1839.

A section also falls within the parish of Cropwell Butler. Upper Saxondale lies in an upland area between the River Trent and the Vale of Belvoir, and between the A52 and A46 roads, close to their junction at Saxondale Roundabout near Bingham. The nearby hamlet of Saxondale was the site of an Anglo-Saxon fort and earthworks, visible from the A52. Growth and features Upper Saxondale was developed on the site of the former Saxondale Hospital by David Wilson Homes from about 1995 to 2001. It includes some 350 dwellings, ranging from three-bedroom converted hospital buildings to newly built five to six-bedroom detached houses. There is also a restaurant-bar called Sanctuary, a hairdresser, tennis club and bowling green. The estate is surrounded by parkland, much of it owned by Upper Saxondale Residents' Association. Upper Saxondale has a designated conservation area of 30 hectares (74 acres). The rare Flame Brocade moth (Trigonophora flammea) has been spotted there. The boundary of this encompasses the former Saxondale Hospital site and includes extensive semi- wooded grounds, parkland landscape and fine trees. The chapel was built in 1902 to the designs of E. W. Roberts, then County Architect, for use by hospital staff and patients. The small Gothic Revival building is home to the Catalyst Church (part of Christian Growth International). David Wilson Homes originally called the development St James Park, but a change of name to Upper Saxondale was voted at a Residents' Association meeting in 1999. Upper Saxondale also includes original houses in Saxondale Drive, which are not part of the development. The conversions of the Victorian buildings, the mature parkland, its core of community buildings and its public open spaces amount to a residential area of an unusual character. There are several ghost stories relating to the area. One has a troop of Roman soldiers marching up Henson Lane. The ghost of Lady Elinor Denison is said to haunt the grounds. King Henry VII is said to have camped on land to the west during the Battle of Stoke Field. A RAF Avro Anson Mk.I bomber crashed close to Upper Saxondale during the Second World War. Both crew were killed. The site is marked by five mature trees set out in the shape of a cross in the middle of a field close to the main Saxondale Drive. The impact made a slight hollow and piles of earth are still clearly visible. The site was originally marked with a memorial stone, although this has now been removed.

MedWatch is used for reporting an adverse event or sentinel event. Founded in 1993, this system of voluntary reporting allows such information to be shared with the medical community or the general public. The system includes publicly available databases and online analysis tools for professionals. MedWatch also distributes information on medical recalls and other clinical safety communications via its platforms.  History  MedWatch was founded in 1993 to collect data regarding adverse events in healthcare. An adverse event is any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product. The MedWatch system collects reports of adverse reactions and quality problems of drugs and medical devices but also for other FDA-regulated products (such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, medical foods, and infant formulas). As of the summer of 2011, the program had received more than 40,000 adverse event reports.  Operations  Voluntary reporting by healthcare professionals, consumers, and patients is conducted on a single, one-page reporting form (Form FDA 3500). Reporting can be conducted online, by phone, or by submitting the MedWatch 3500 form by mail or fax. In 2013, MedWatch introduced Form 3500B, which is designed to facilitate reporting by healthcare consumers. The MedWatch system is intended to detect safety hazard signals for medical products. If a signal is detected, the FDA can issue medical product safety alerts or order product recalls, withdrawals, or labeling changes to protect the public health. Important safety information is disseminated to the medical community and the general public via the MedWatch web site. and the MedWatch E-list. Raw data from the MedWatch system, together with adverse drug reaction reports from manufacturers as required by regulation, are part of a public database. Online tools (such as those from eHealthMe) that analyze the database are available for both health care consumers and professionals. The database was used by journalists to investigate FDA's drug approval practice.

Method Electrofishing relies on two electrodes which deliver direct current at high- voltage from the anode to the cathode through the water. When a fish encounters a large enough potential gradient on this path, it becomes affected by the electricity. Usually pulsed direct current (DC) is applied, which causes galvanotaxis in the fish. Galvanotaxis is uncontrolled muscular convulsion that results in the fish swimming towards the anode. At least two people are required for an effective electrofishing crew: one to operate the anode, and the other to catch the stunned fish with a dip net. Types Electrofishing by boat There are three types of electrofishers: backpack models, tote barge models, and boat mounted models, sometimes called a stunboat. Backpack electrofisher generators are either battery or gas powered. They employ a transformer to pulse the current before it is delivered into the water. The anode is located at the end of a long, two meter pole and is usually in the form of a ring. The cathode is a long, three meter braided steel cable that trails behind the operator. The electrofisher is operated by a deadman's switch on the anode pole. There are a number of safety features built into newer backpack models, such as audible speakers that sound when the unit is operating, tilt-switches that incapacitate the electrofisher if the backpack is tilted more than 45 degrees, and quick-release straps to enable the user to quickly remove the electrofisher in the event of some emergency. When boat electrofishing, the boat itself is the cathode, and the anode(s) are generally mounted off the bow. The stunned fish swim toward the anode, where they are caught alive using a dip net. Towed barge electrofishers operate similarly to backpack electrofishers, with the exception that the generator is located on a floating barge instead of on a backpack. Often the barge can be left stationary on the shore and longer cathodes and anodes allow the crew to sample large areas. Barge electrofishers often employ gas-powered generators since a user does not have to carry the extra weight on his or her back. A method of electrofishing using illegally diverted electricity from overhead electric lines is prevalent in parts of the Indian State of Kerala. This can result in accidental deaths due to electrocution. Effectiveness The effectiveness of electrofishing is influenced by a variety of biological, technical, logistical, and environmental factors. The catch is often selectively biased as to fish size and species composition. When using pulsed DC for fishing, the pulse rate and the intensity of the electric field strongly influence the size and nature of the catch. The conductivity of the water influences the shape and extent of the electric field and thus affects the field's ability to induce capture-prone behavior in the fish. It can also cause injury to the fish. The electricity causes muscle spasms that damage the vertebrae. For unknown reasons,2003 study: Immobilization Thresholds of Electrofishing Relative to Fish Size, biologists Chad Dolan and Steve Miranda this is more common and severe in longer fish. Legality While electrofishing is used by multiple government agencies, it may be illegal to use it as a form of recreational fishing. This method can be considered poaching. For example, in Florida, it is illegal statewide as recreational use .

It is an intramolecular variant of the halohydrin synthesis reaction. The reaction was first reported by M. J. Bougalt in 1904 and has since become one of the most effective ways to synthesize lactones. Strengths of the reaction include the mild conditions and incorporation of the versatile iodine atom into the product. :IodolactonizationIntroduction Iodolactonization has been used in the synthesis of many natural products including those with medicinal applications such as vernoplepin and vernomenin, two compounds used in tumor growth inhibition, and vibralactone, a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that has been used in the treatment of obesity. Iodolactonization has also been used by E.J. Corey to synthesize numerous prostaglandins. History Kaustubh Rai's report of iodolactonization represented the first example of a reliable lactonization that could be used in many different systems. Bromolactonization was actually developed in the twenty years prior to Bougalt’s publication of iodolactonization. However, bromolactonization is much less commonly used because the simple electrophilic addition of bromine to an olefin, seen below, can compete with the bromolactonization reaction and reduce the yield of the desired lactone. Bromolatonization Chlorolactonization methods first appeared in the 1950s but are even less commonly employed than bromolactonization. The use of elemental chlorine is procedurally difficult because it is a gas at room temperature, and the electrophilic addition product can be rapidly produced as in bromolactonization. Mechanism The reaction mechanism involves the formation of a positively charged halonium ion in a molecule that also contains a carboxylic acid (or other functional group that is a precursor to it). The oxygen of the carboxyl acts as a nucleophile, attacking to open the halonium ring and instead form a lactone ring. The reaction is usually performed under mildly basic conditions to increase the nucleophilicity of the carboxyl group. :Iodolactonization Scope The iodolactonization reaction includes a number of nuances that affect product formation including regioselectivity, ring size preference, and thermodynamic and kinetic control. In terms of regioselectivity, iodolactonization preferentially occurs at the most hindered carbon atom adjacent to the iodonium cation. This is due to the fact that the more substituted carbon is better able to maintain a partial positive charge and is thus more electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack. When multiple double bonds in a molecule are equally reactive, conformational preferences dominate. However, when one double bond is more reactive, that reactivity always dominates regardless of conformational preference. :IodolactonizationRegioselectivity Both five- and six-membered rings could be formed in the iodolactonization shown below, but the five- membered ring is formed preferentially as predicted by Baldwin's rules for ring closure. According to the rules, 5-exo-tet ring closures are favored while 6-endo-tet ring closures are disfavored. The regioselectivity of each iodolactonization can be predicted and explained using Baldwin's rules. :Iodolactonization Stereoselective iodolactonizations have been seen in literature and can be very useful in synthesizing large molecules such as the aforementioned vernopelin and vernomenin because the lactone can be formed while maintaining other stereocenters. The ring closure can even be driven by stereocenters adjacent to the carbon-carbon multiple bond as shown below. :Iodolactonization Even in systems without existing stereocenters, Bartlett and coworkers found that stereoselectivity was achievable. They were able to synthesize the cis and trans five membered lactones by adjusting reactions conditions such as temperature and reaction time. The trans product was formed under thermodynamic conditions (e.g. a long reaction time) while the cis product was formed under kinetic conditions (e.g. a relatively shorter reaction time). :Iodolactonization Applications Iodolactonization has been used in the synthesis of many biologically important products such as the tumor growth inhibitors vernolepin and vernomenin, the pancreatic lipase inhibitor vibralactone, and prostaglandins, a lipid found in animals. The following total syntheses all use iodolactonization as a key step in obtaining the desired product. In 1977, Samuel Danishefsky and coworkers were able to synthesize the tumor growth inhibitors dl-vernolepin and dl-vernomenin via a multistep process in which a lactonization was employed. This synthesis demonstrates the use of iodolactonization to preferentially form a five- membered ring over a four- or six-membered ring, as expected from Baldwin's Rules. :Danishefsky Iodolactonization In 2006, Zhou and coworkers synthesized another natural product, vibralactone, in which the key step was the formation of a lactone. The stereoselectivity of the iodolactonization sets a critical stereochemical configuration for the target compound. :Iodolactonization In 1969, Corey and coworkers synthesized prostaglandin E2 using an iodolactone intermediate. Again, the stereoselectivity of the iodolactonization plays an integral role in product formation. :Iodolactonization See also * Lactam * Halogen addition reaction References Category:Oxygen heterocycle forming reactions Category:Lactones Category:Organic reactions ","title":"Iodolactonization"},{"id":"12694888","text":"Đorđe Lavrnić (, (June 6, 1946 - November 27, 2010) was a Serbian handball player who competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.

Since launching the event in 1997, SuperJam has attracted thousands of listeners from North Carolina and southern Virginia, with numerous annual attendees traveling from locations throughout the United States. There were eighteen consecutive SuperJam concert events. SuperJam performing artists The station's debut summer show, SuperJam, took place Friday night, June 20, 1997, at Greensboro Coliseum in front of 20,000 fans and featured Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lil' Kim, OutKast, Lost Boyz, SWV, Freak Nasty and others.

SuperJam logistics All SuperJam concerts took place on Friday nights in late June and have been held at the Greensboro Coliseum. Showtime has remained 7:30 PM, throughout. The entire 102 JAMZ airstaff, the 102 JAMZ Mix Squad and the JAMZ Street Team actively participated in each event, hosting during the time between acts and emceeing during Mix Squad intervals. Beginning with SuperJam VII, the 102 JAMZ Dancers, led by Lady C of Sunday night's 11:00 Reggae Jamz show, performed a choreographed routine between acts during each SuperJam, through the 2011 show. The first ten 102 JAMZ SuperJam concerts were numbered consecutively, with the exception of the 1st (simply called SuperJam) and 4th (SuperJam 2000). SuperJam ticket prices consistently remained significantly lower than other music concerts, from the outset. Ticket prices begin at $10 each, with mid-level tickets offered at $19.50 and $25, floor seats at $35, and some higher priced Platinum Seats available. As Program Director, Brian Douglas, explains, \\"From the beginning, we've seen SuperJam as the biggest opportunity we have each year to give back to our listeners. Concert ticket prices keep getting higher and higher... often $100 and more for the good shows. With SuperJam, it's all about more acts for less money. The goal is always to be sure every listener can afford a ticket and every show is one they'll remember.\\" 102 JAMZ' SuperJam Block Party From 1999 to 2011, each SuperJam concert was preceded by a 102 JAMZ Block Party, hosted by the station's afternoon personality (originally Boogie D, later Big Tap Money). These \\"party before the party\\" events, first held outside the coliseum, later in the Greensboro Coliseum Pavilion and in 2010 and 2011 in the Coliseum West Wing B, feature hundreds of ticket upgrades, impromptu performances by the night's talent lineup and live, interactive artist interviews. SuperJam Block Parties were carried live on 102 JAMZ, from 3:00 to 7:00 PM, to set the stage for the show and prepare the listeners for the concert. SuperJam background According to the programming staff, planning for each year's SuperJam began in \\"Jam-Uary\\" (January). Brian Douglas states that inspiration for the creation of the SuperJam concept arose from two sources... exposure to annual summer concerts put together by a radio station in his native Florida during his youth (WAPE, Jacksonville's Big Ape Conventions and Big Ape Shower of Stars) and 102 JAMZ' experiment with a modified summer concert in 1996. This outdoor event, billed as Busta Brown Bingo, was presented as part of a contest in which featured afternoon personality Busta Brown skydived onto a random block in a squared-off area to award a station contestant $10,000. As incentive for others to attend, the station assembled acts to perform, including Junior M.A.F.I.A. with Lil' Kim, 112, Bahamadia and Nonchalant. Attendance was strong and listeners responded positively to the concept, setting the stage for the original SuperJam one year later.

Cole, Wale, DJ Drama and Ca$h Out were named, with tickets to go on sale May 18. Social media leaks preceded each on-air announcement. Ticket giveaways began earlier than usual, with listeners responding to Rick Ross’ on-air \\"Mic Checks\\" in late May. Next, the audience was encouraged to listen for a series of \\"Super Songs\\" in order to win VIP tickets in the first 5 rows, including a number of front row tickets. In June, the station began giving away pairs of tickets every hour. The week of the show, VIP tickets were give away daily, on Fifth Row Monday, Fourth Row Tuesday, etc. The morning of the show, Friday, June 29, a record company executive called to inform the station that 2 Chainz’ father was in the hospital in critical condition and expected to pass away. Thus, 2 Chainz would not be performing at Super Jam. The radio station brought two giant sympathy cards for 2 Chainz and his family to the Greensboro Coliseum lobby, which were signed by hundreds of attendees before the show. 102 JAMZ did an on-stage tribute during the show, asking for a moment of silence in his honor. A few days later 2 Chainz’ father died, with his son at his side. He subsequently called the station, offered his apologies for missing the show and spoke movingly about the love and support he was shown by his fans in North Carolina. Along with Rick Ross, J. Cole, Wale, DJ Drama and Ca$h Out, SuperJam 2012 featured special mixes by J-Flex, DJ Ern's Twerk Mix and a series of on- stage contests. SuperJam (2013) In late March, 102 JAMZ began slipping in occasional mentions of SuperJam. The station's \\"Bracket Boss\\" won the first pair of tickets for best NCAA Tournament prediction. Preceded by leaks on Twitter, Facebook and 102JAMZ.com, 102 JAMZ announced the lineup on May 3... Future, 2 Chainz, Wale, A$AP Rocky and Ace Hood, with an on-sale date of Friday, May 10. Promotional announcements mentioned \\"Starship SuperJam\\" with references to outer space and Future.

For almost two weeks, the station gave away pairs of tickets every hour, day and night, followed by several days of \\"V.I.P. Platform Seats\\" contesting every hour, then tickets in each of the first five rows. SuperJam Tickets and V.I.P. Platform Seats were given away on the streets, as well. DJ Lil Vegas and \\"Do It All\\" Willis created SuperJam 2013: The Mixtape. Friday night, June 21 at 7:30, French Montana appeared as a surprise last minute replacement for A$AP Rocky.

The week of the show, sets of tickets were given away daily in each of the first five rows, building to Front Row Friday. The 18th annual SuperJam was streamed live with contesting, special Mix Squad sets and entertainment filling any downtime between acts.  2015  On Thursday morning, May 14 at 7:45, B-Daht of 102 JAMZ' 3 Live Crew morning show announced \\"some bad news\\"... that there would be no SuperJam in 2015. Sounding heartfelt, he said this was the worst day of his career, then reminisced about growing up in Greensboro and attending SuperJam concerts each year. He mentioned seeing Diddy and Lil' Kim, being impressed with Busta Rhymes and, as part of the on- air staff, the excitement of being at the show where \\"Gucci Mane and Jeezy were beefing and we had both of them in the same building at the same time.\\" He spoke of the difficulty of putting together a great show each year from the few acts the listeners might like to see, how some are touring or in the studio, other have prior commitments, etc. He talked about feeling that 102 JAMZ had a great show planned for 2015, then having two major acts tell the station they were not available within a few days. He spoke of how the staff had \\"tried everything we could to put this thing together.\\" Simultaneously, the station issued a statement on 102JAMZ.com, on Facebook, and through Instagram. Under the header SuperJam Cancellation Announcement, the following was posted: 102 JAMZ regrets to announce the cancellation of this year's SuperJam. Over the years, the goal has always been to put together a strong show at a low ticket price. That has become increasingly difficult, and this year, impossible. We can't tell you how sorry we are to have to share this news with you and how much we appreciate the support you've shown SuperJam over the years.

Lee. The film also features an ensemble cast featuring: Martin Lawrence, Nicole Ari Parker, Margaret Avery, Michael Clarke Duncan, Mike Epps, Mo'Nique, Cedric the Entertainer, Louis C.K., and James Earl Jones. Plot Dr. R.J. “Roscoe” Stevens (Martin Lawrence) is a successful talk-show host, having discarded his awkward Southern roots, and is engaged to Survivor winner Bianca Kittles (Joy Bryant). Bringing Bianca and his 10-year-old son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) to his sleepy Southern hometown for his parents 50th wedding anniversary, R.J. is determined to prove he is no longer the walking disaster his family used to pick on. In Georgia, he is met by his pick- pocketing cousin Reggie (Mike Epps), and arrives at the family home to greet his parents, Roscoe Sr. (James Earl Jones) and Mama Jenkins (Margaret Avery); his brother Otis (Michael Clarke Duncan), the town sheriff; Otis' wife Ruthie (Liz Mikel) and their overgrown kids, Junior (Brandin Jenkins) and Callie (Krystal Marea Braud); and Roscoe's rowdy sister Betty (Mo'Nique). Roscoe's cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) drops in, reigniting their past competitiveness, and escorting Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker), Roscoe’s past love interest. Roscoe endures much self-humiliation: he accidentally hits his mother in the head with a softball, is beaten up by Otis and Betty after insulting them, faces constant blackmail by Reggie, and is sprayed by a skunk while sleeping. It becomes obvious that he still holds a grudge against his father for showing Clyde preferential treatment when they were younger, while Roscoe Sr. resents his son for changing his name and distancing himself from his family. Bianca does not fit in well with the Jenkins, and Roscoe and Lucinda get reacquainted. On the Jenkins' anniversary, the whole family gathers for their traditional obstacle course. Roscoe and Clyde aggressively make their way through, hurting themselves and others. When Roscoe begins to help his son over an obstacle, Bianca tells him to leave Jamaal and he does, to his parents' shock. Roscoe and Clyde race to the finish line, and Roscoe wins. As Bianca cheers, Roscoe berates his family, reminding them that it is all about \\"the team of me\\". The family is angry, Jamaal refuses to go near his father, and Roscoe Sr. reprimands his son for his behavior. Unable to contain his resentment, Roscoe lashes out at his father, saying that although Clyde's father died, Roscoe felt he lost his own father because he always favored Clyde, and chastises him for crediting Clyde’s accomplishments while never acknowledging any of Roscoe’s success. Stunned, Roscoe Sr. realizes he is the reason his son left home and walks off feeling guilty. Now seeing why Roscoe resented him, Clyde tells Roscoe he never tried to take his place, but only wanted to be accepted by the family and sees Roscoe as his brother. He tries to shake Roscoe's hand, but Bianca rebuffs him, and Roscoe leaves with Bianca and Jamaal, but not before his mother reminds him that his family still loves him. Driving to the airport, Bianca proposes not inviting the family to their wedding. Roscoe seems to agree, upsetting Jamaal, who proudly declares himself a Jenkins. Bianca continues to insult the Jenkins clan and Roscoe pretends to agree with her, but dumps her and her bags at the airport. Roscoe and Jamaal return to the family home with Bianca's Pomeranian Fifi, who had pursued a relationship with the Jenkins’ over-aged dog Bucky. During the anniversary celebration, Clyde cries during his speech for Mama and Papa Jenkins, admitting how much he cares about Roscoe, who appears, apologizing to his family and congratulating his parents. He and his father make amends, and Roscoe asks Lucinda to dance. After the celebration, the family watches video of the celebration on a big-screen TV while Roscoe and Lucinda depart to make love, discovering when they enter the bedroom that the dogs Bucky and Fifi had intercourse, too. During the credits, Roscoe interviews his family on his show, renamed The Roscoe Jenkins Show. Cast * Martin Lawrence as Dr. RJ Stevens/Roscoe Steven Jenkins, Jr.: a famous talk show host.

Box office In its opening weekend at the North American box office, the film grossed $16.2 million USD, opening at #2 behind Fool's Gold. Reception Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 23% based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 4.46/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins has moments of comic inspiration – and long stretches of overdone slapstick.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Rolling Stones Peter Travers criticized Lee for getting his cast to perform \\"crass routines that should have gone out with minstrel shows.\\" Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle was surprised by Lawrence's attempt at being the film's \\"quiet center\\" and \\"soul of endearing insecurity\\" in the title role but felt it gets bogged down by lowbrow humor, concluding that \\"it's capable at times of real subtlety [and] warmth and humanity but not confident enough in itself to stay away from fart jokes or empty acts of sassiness for very long.\\" Nick Schager of Slant Magazine felt the script contained false conflicts and \\"narrative staleness\\" throughout the plot but gave Lee credit for allowing Lawrence and his co-stars to \\"play to their strengths,\\" saying they \\"help[s] enliven what's otherwise simply another soggy family reunion melodrama\\". Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News said, \\"Although Lee relies on too many lame gross-out jokes, this cast does know how to have fun - which may come as welcome relief to audiences desperate for laughs during a cold month at the movies.\\" The A.V. Clubs Scott Tobias gave the film a \\"C+\\" grade. He commended Lee for taking Tyler Perry's formula to make it \\"less jarring and more palatable\\" for viewers and giving his supporting cast enough room to deliver their own material (singling out Mo'Nique as \\"a surprising standout\\"), but was critical of Lawrence's \\"sub-Eddie Murphy hijinks\\" and overuse of slapstick with various humans and animals, concluding that \\"In other words, it's about as good as a movie featuring gratuitous Pomeranian-humping could possibly be.\\" Home release The film was released on DVD June 17, 2008 and in the UK May 30, 2008.Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins On DVD ReferencesExternal links   Category:2008 films Category:2008 comedy films Category:2008 drama films Category:2008 comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:African-American films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Films about families Category:Films directed by Malcolm D.

At first he painted with a subdued palette, but from 1902 onwards used increasingly bright colors. He was a leading member of the Septem group of colorist painters. In Finland, Magnus is considered to have been a very influential symbolist artist.Decorated – Magnus Enckell, Cathedral, Tampere in words and in pictures, the city of Tampere.Magnus Enckell, The Awakening, the Ateneum Art Museum, Archive.org Biography Knut Magnus Enckell was born on November 9, 1870, in Hamina, a small town in eastern Finland, the son of Carl Enckell, a priest, and Alexandra Enckell (born Appelberg). He was the youngest of six sons. In 1889, at the age of 19, he began his artistic studies in Helsinki, at the drawing school of the Finnish Art Society, but he dropped out and continued his studies privately under Gunnar Berndtson. Naturalism was the established style during his education in Helsinki 1889–1891. In 1891 he went to Paris for the first time, where he became a student of Jules-Joseph Lefebvre and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant at the Académie Julian.Grove Aet Online There he was drawn to the Symbolist movement, and was influenced by the painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes as well as Symbolist literature. Self-Portrait, 1891 During a stay in Brittany he made two paintings in spare colors: Self-Portrait and Breton Woman. He was enthusiastic about the Renaissance and about the idealistic and mystical ideas of Sâr Péladan. During his second stay in Paris in 1893, he painted The Awakening, in which he used a rigorous composition and transparent colors to suggest a spiritual atmosphere; and, through contact with the Swedish artists, Olof Sager-Nelson and Ivan Aguéli, he deepened his interest in mysticism.Benezit Dictionary of Artists It is generally believed that Enckell was a homosexual, as seems indicated in some erotic portraits which were quite uninhibited for their time, but his homosexuality has never been officially proven. As Routledge's Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History puts it, \\"His love affairs with men have not been denied ... Enckell's naked men and boys are openly erotic and sensual.\\"Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II. Ed. Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon, Routledge, 2001, p. 148.

In 1894 and 1895 Enckell traveled to Milan, Florence, Ravenna, Siena and Venice, where his inner conflicts were reflected in his art. In 1898 he taught himself fresco and tempera techniques in Florence, by studying the work of Masaccio and Fra Angelico. The years in Italy gave his work a greater range of colors and a more optimistic foundation. In the first years of the twentieth century, under the influence of Post Impressionism, he developed a brighter, more colorful palette. An example of this is the series, The Bathers, in dark, lively colors. Together with Verner Thomé and Ellen Thesleff, Enckell founded the group 'Septem', in which artists who shared his beliefs came together. 1907 Enckell executed the commission for the altarpiece of Tampere Cathedral. The fresco, more than 10 meters wide and 4 meters high, shows, in subdued colors, the resurrection of people of all races. In the middle of the painting two men walk hand in hand. Portrait by Alfred Finch, 1915 Self-Portrait, 1918 From 1901 onwards Enckell spent many summers on the island of Suursaari, where he painted his \\"Boys on the Beach\\" (1910). He organised exhibitions of Finnish art in Berlin (1903) and Paris (1908), and of French and Belgian art in Helsinki (1904). He chaired the from 1915 to 1918, and was elected a member of the Fine Art Academy of Finland in 1922.\\"Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II, Том 1\\"by Robert Aldrich,Garry Wotherspoon Enckell died in Stockholm in 1925.

It was released as the album's fourth single on February 24, 1997. Due to its use in a series of advertisements promoting Texas tourism, the phrase has also come to be used independently to describe the quirky and sometimes misunderstood attitudes associated with Texas. Lyrics That's Right is a lighthearted song that lightly mocks the popularity of cowboy fashions in urban settings, and reflects the general sense of Texan pride that newcomers and outsiders often misunderstand. The second verse is a tribute to the members of Uncle Walt's Band, a band actually from South Carolina who later became associated with the Austin, Texas country music scene. > Those boys from Carolina > They sure enough could sing > But when they came on down to Texas > We all showed them how to swing > Now David's on the radio > And old Champ's still on the guitar > And Uncle Walt he's home with Heidi > Hiding in her loving arms Lovett was a huge fan of Uncle Walt's band as a college student, and Lovett had gone on to produce Hyatt's 1990 album King Tears. Walter Hyatt died a month before the release of this album. Other media In 1999, the Texas tourism board ran an ad campaign featuring Lyle Lovett singing the refrain \\"That's Right, You're Not from Texas, but Texas wants you anyway.\\"Lyle Lovett - other works from IMDb Possibly because of the national exposure of the ad campaign, the phrase has been used independently, even in non-musical contexts as a general expression conveying Texans' sometimes baffling customs. Roger Ebert titled a compilation of responses to his review of the movie Friday Night Lights \\"That's right you're not from Texas\\", in which most of the writers rebuked Ebert for misunderstanding the devout Texan football culture.\\"That's right, you're not from Texas\\" by Roger Ebert, originally published in the Chicago Observer on October 17, 2004.

E. Waddell High School was a high school located in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was closed at the end of the 2010-2011 school year. The facility that housed the former high school is now used by E. E. Waddell Language Academy, a public K-8 language immersion magnet school History In the mid-1990s, responding to phenomenal growth in the southern parts of Mecklenburg County, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board decided to build a new high school between South Mecklenburg and Olympic high schools. The new school was to open for the 2001-2002 school year. The site selected was located off I-77 on Nations Ford Road. In the spring of 2001, the School Board named the new school after Elbert Edwin Waddell (1922–1988). The school was dedicated formally on Sunday, June 2, 2002. In 2010, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools voted to close the high school and use the facility for Smith Academy of International Languages due to budget cuts and low enrollment rates. The school was renamed E. E. Waddell Language Academy. In 2011, the last graduating class of E. E. Waddell High School graduated. John Ngyuen graduated Valedictorian. Alanna Estevez graduated Salutatorian. Mascot The school's original mascot, the Raider, reflects the rich history of the Nations Ford (a convenient crossing over the Catawba River) and surrounding area in the founding of the United States. It is reminiscent of the \\"overmountain men\\" and other southern patriots who fought with unconventional methods—which contributed to the southern piedmont being described as a \\"Hornet's Nest\\" in the Revolutionary War (1775–1781). When Smith Language Academy relocated to the Waddell campus, the Ram mascot was brought along. The school's athletic teams are known as the Waddell Language Academy Rams.  Stadium  E.E. Waddell Language Academy Stadium is a 6,000-capacity stadium located on the grounds of E. E. Waddell Language Academy in Charlotte, North Carolina. The stadium is used for Waddell Soccer, track and field, and American Football. It also served as the home ground for the Charlotte Eagles of the USL Second Division through the 2007 season. In 2013, Olympic and West Mecklenburg high schools moved several games to the stadium while their own stadiums underwent renovations. Namesake E. E. Waddell, educator and community leader, received his bachelor's and master's degrees from North Carolina A & T State University and his Doctor of Education degree from Duke University. He served as principal of Kingville High School (Albemarle, N. C.) from 1943 to 1963, and in honor of his community involvement, the original school campus was renamed E. E. Waddell Community Center. Waddell was principal of Charlotte's Second Ward High School from 1963 to 1969 when he was named Assistant to the Superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. From 1976 to 1979, he was Area Superintendent in the Harding Area. In 1979, he was appointed Assistant Superintendent for Auxiliary Services, the position he held until his retirement in 1982. Notable alumni Alexander Michael Cecil won first place in the 2011 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair for his project titled The Assessment of Silver Nanoparticles in the Environment on Gene Expression in C. elegans.

They were among the most popular acoustic bands in Austin, Texas during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and were particularly noted for their intricate 3-part vocal harmonies as well as a sound that combined traditional country motifs with jazz, bluegrass, and Beatles-esque influences. History Shortly after forming, Uncle Walt's Band moved from Spartanburg, South Carolina to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1972, where they caught the attention of Texas singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey, who would become the band's first noted fan. It was in 1972 that, with Ramsey's encouragement, the band first visited Texas where they would eventually reside. The band returned to the Carolinas in 1974, recording Blame It on the Bossanova, their first record, at Charlotte, North Carolina's Arthur Smith Studios. It, and a similar release titled simply Uncle Walt's Band (released in 1978 with same songs in a re-shuffled order), were released on Hyatt's Lespedeza Records label. In 1978, Uncle Walt's Band played a reunion gig in Austin, Texas, and the success that followed kept the band together in subsequent years. They played regularly in and around Austin until 1983, when they broke up after David Ball returned to Nashville to pursue his solo music career. During this period in Austin the band enjoyed considerable popularity and was a major influence on other artists including Lyle Lovett, Marcia Ball, Toni Price, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and Lucinda Williams. During this time Uncle Walt's Band released two more albums on the local Lespedeza label, 1980s An American in Texas and 1982's Uncle Walt's Band Recorded Live, which was recorded at the Waterloo Ice House in Austin. Legacy Hood and Hyatt both remained in Austin following Ball's departure. Hyatt moved to Nashville in the late 1980s but remained a frequent presence in the Austin music scene until his death on May 11, 1996 in the crash of ValuJet Flight 592. Hood lived and performed in Austin until his death from cancer on November 3, 2001. Many Austin musicians continue to play songs written by members of Uncle Walt's Band. Hood's son Warren continues to reside in Austin and is a highly accomplished musician, including being a 7-time recipient of Best String Player at the Austin Music Awards. Much of his repertoire draws upon the music of Uncle Walt's Band. Warren's cousin Marshall Hood moved to Austin from Spartanburg as a cofounder of The Belleville Outfit, another young band strongly influenced by Uncle Walt's Band which was active from 2007-2011. In 2007, during South by Southwest, the Austin Music Awards put together a tribute to Uncle Walt's Band, featuring Lyle Lovett and David Ball along with Warren and Marshall Hood. More recently, Warren and Marshall have reunited with Ball for a series of performances in tribute to Uncle Walt's Band under the name That Carolina Sound. While Uncle Walt's Band's reputation and influence were strongest in the Southern U.S., particularly Austin and Spartanburg, the band also gained dedicated followings elsewhere including the University of California, Berkeley and Moscow University in Russia.

Kalamay (also spelled Calamay, literally \\"sugar\\"), is a sticky sweet delicacy that is popular in many regions of the Philippines. It is made of coconut milk, brown sugar, and ground glutinous rice. It can also be flavored with margarine, peanut butter, or vanilla. Kalamay can be eaten alone but is usually used as a sweetener for a number of Filipino desserts and beverages. Preparation Kalamay is made by extracting coconut milk from grated coconuts twice. Glutinous rice is added to the first batch of coconut milk and the mixture is ground into a paste. Brown sugar is added to the second batch of coconut milk and boiled for several hours to make latík. The mixture of ground glutinous rice and coconut milk is then poured into the latík and stirred until the consistency becomes very thick. It can be served hot or at room temperature especially when eaten with other dishes. Viscous Kalamay are often served cooled to make it less runny and easier to eat. Consumption Kalamay is a popular pasalubong (the Filipino tradition of a homecoming gift). They are often eaten alone, directly from the packaging. Kalamay is also used in a variety of traditional Filipino dishes as a sweetener, including the suman and the bukayo. It can also be added to beverages like coffee, milk, or hot chocolate. Biko and sinukmani are similar dishes which use whole glutinous rice grains. The preparation is the same except that the glutinous rice is first cooked whole and not ground into a paste, and then is smothered with the latík. In some regions (particularly in the Northern Philippines), this dish is referred to as the kalamay, with the viscous kind differentiated as the kalamay-hati. The latík from kalamay by itself can be used with other desserts, particularly with dishes made from cassava (which is then referred to as 'cassava kalamay'). Kalamay is also commonly confused with matamis sa bao, a similar viscous dish. However, the latter does not use rice. Biko topped with caramel-like latik. Types Kalamay slices on banana leaves from Bustos, Bulacan Kalamay ube is naturally purple due to the use of purple yam There are many variations and types of kalamay. Kalamay can be divided roughly into two types: the syrupy kind used in conjunction with other dishes (higher latik ratio), and the gummy chewy kind which is more expensive and usually eaten on its own. *Antipolo kalamay (also called kalamay perya) – the Tagalog version of kalamay. It is a specialty of Antipolo. It is traditionally served as a flat disk on banana leaves, topped with latik curds. It has a denser chewier texture. *Bohol kalamay – kalamay from the island of Bohol can vary from extremely sweet to mildly sweet. It is distinctive for being sold inside halved smooth coconut shells (the mesocarp of coconuts, locally known as bagol or paya). These containers are then sealed shut with a characteristic red crepe paper (papel de japon). This type of packaging is known as kalamay-hati (literally 'Half kalamay'). *Baguio Kalamay – a type of kalamay from Baguio, Philippines. It is also known as Sundot Kulangot (literally 'Picked Booger') because of its consistency. It is sweetened with molasses which adds to its color. It is uniquely packed into halved pitogo (Sago Palm of the genus Cycas) shells and sealed with red crepe paper in a similar manner to the Bohol kalamay. It is the smallest known traditional packaging of kalamay. They are sold in bundles, several of these kalamay balls are nestled inside split bamboo and tied with a string. *Iloilo kalamay – kalamay (also known as klamay-hati) from the province of Iloilo and the island of Negros. It is thicker in consistency than other types of kalamay. The town of San Enrique celebrates a Kalamay Festival. *Candon kalamay – kalamay from Candon City, Ilocos Sur. It is sold wrapped in banana leaves or in coconut shells, though modern packaging uses polystyrene containers wrapped in cellophane. Candon City also celebrates a Kalamay Festival. *Nilubyan or iniruban – a kind of kalamay made from pounded green rice. It originates from Camiling, Tarlac in the Northern Philippines. *Mindoro kalamay – a version of kalamay from the island of Mindoro. It usually contains grated coconut and is flavored with peanut butter or vanilla. *Indang kalamay (also called calamay buna) – is a sweet delicacy of sticky rice, brown sugar and coconut milk that is well known in Indang Cavite. This variety of calamay from Indang is made from glutinous pulverized rice called malagkit mixed with coconut milk and panutsa (native jaggery). Similar to other traditional kakanin rice cakes, kalamay also has variants based on secondary ingredients, they include: *Kalamay gabi – kalamay made with taro (gabi). It is typically milky white in color. *Kalamay na pinpipig (also known as kalamay na duman or kalamay pandan) – kalamay flavored with pandan leaf extracts and topped with toasted and pounded immature rice grains (pinipig or duman). It is bright green in color. *Kalamay ube – kalamay made with ube (purple yam). It is lavender or purple in color. It superficially resembles ube halaya, but has a smoother texture. Origin Kalamay, in many Visayan languages (particularly Hiligaynon), is synonymous with 'sugar' (extracted from sugarcane). The word is usually elided to kamay in modern Cebuano dialects. In the Waray language, kalamay refers to a hardened cake of molasses used as sweeteners for many cooked desserts. Its production has been known since the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. Similar desserts A cousin of kalamay is dodol, found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and in some parts of the Philippines. It uses similar basic ingredients and preparation. Dodol, however, is a solid candy, unlike the liquid kalamay. Kalamay is visually similar to the Chinese nian gao (also known as tikoy in the Philippines), but they are not related.

She distinguished herself when the village of Leucate was besieged by Spanish forces allied with the Catholic League in 1590, after her husband, the governor, was captured and executed by the enemy. She was born in 1558 in Montpellier. She was the daughter of the director of the Bureau of Accounts of Montpellier and niece of the governor of Leucate. On 6 April 1577 she married Jean de Boursiez, seigneur de Pantnaut de Barri, with whom she had five children: Hercule, Anne- Françoise, Antoine, Paul and Frances. After the battle of 1590, King Henry IV made Françoise the governor of Leucate until her son Hercule came of age. She died in Montpellier in 1614, aged 56, and was buried next to her husband in the chapel of St. Anne Church of St. Paul of Narbonne. In 1899 a bronze statue of her by the sculptor Paul Ducuing was erected in the Place de la République in Leucate, holding up the keys to the village. In May 1942 the Vichy government ordered the statue to be taken down, and the bronze sent to Germany. When the statue was lifted onto a truck, the hand holding the keys broke off. It is still kept in the Town Hall. A new statue was set up on 17 August 1975.  References  * Mme.

It started to flourish around 200 BC, and continued into the 17th century. This mountainous historical area is now a national archeological park in the jurisdiction of the municipality of Inza, Department of Cauca, Colombia. The park is located 100 km away from the capital of the Department, Popayán. Tierradentro culture is related to the neighbouring San Agustín culture. The area is very well known for its pre-Columbian hypogea, which were found in several excavations, and are divided in many archeological places. some of them are: Alto del Aguacate (Avocado Hill), Alto de San Andrés, Alto de Segovia, Alto del Duende and El Tablón. The typical hypogeum has an entry oriented towards the west, a spiral staircase and a main chamber, usually 5 to 8 meters below the surface, with several lesser chambers around, each one containing a corpse. The walls are painted with geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic patterns in red, black and white. Some statues and remains of pottery and fabrics can be seen scarcely due to grave robbery before the hypogea were constituted as protected areas. The pre-Columbian culture that created this funeral complex inhabited this area during the first millennium A.C. Tierradentro Archaeological park features hypogea dating from 6th to 9th centuries AD. The details in the sculptures and pictoric patterns are similar to the San Agustín culture. The park generates significant revenue to the local economy due to the high volume of tourists, both Colombian and foreigners. These sites form a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Early life Thomas was the third son of Joseph Chitty and his wife, Elizabeth née Woodward. He was never called to the bar but began to practise as a special pleader in 1820 at the early age of nineteen.Hamilton (2004) Legal practice Chitty practised at 1 King's Bench Walk where he educated a generation of eminent pupils including: *Hugh Cairns, a future Lord Chancellor; *Farrer Herschell, another; *James Whiteside, a future Chief Justice of Ireland; *William Shee;Barker, G. F. R. (2004) \\"Shee, Sir William (1804–1868)\\", rev. Hugh Mooney, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 24 July 2007 – and sundry future judges and politicians. The practice of special pleader demanded mastery of detail and the technical intricacies of the law and Chitty's career spanned huge changes from the Common Law Procedure Acts 1852-4 to the Judicature Acts 1873-5, reforms that changed the ancient regime of forms of action into, essentially, the modern system. Chitty exploited the opportunity in publishing a number of practitioners' texts including preparing new editions of: *John Frederick Archbold's The Practice of the Court of King's Bench in Personal Actions and Ejectments, despite Archbold's objections; *His father's Treatise on the Parties to Actions; *Richard Burn's Justice of the Peace (1845); – and publishing several works in his own right including Forms of Practical Proceedings (1834). His grandson T. Willes Chitty edited the 11th edition in 1879. Family, personality and death \\"Chitty was known as a kind and genial man, a keen whist player and musician, and an energetic volunteer.\\" He retired in 1877, and died at home in London. In 1826, he had married Eliza née Cawston, and the couple had two sons who followed in their father's legal footsteps: *Thomas Edward Chitty (1826/7-1868), clerk to the Bristol assizes; and *Joseph William Chitty, became a judge in 1881, a notable Liberal politician.

He performed a number of songs in the film, including the a-capella versions of \\"Minnie Was A Hepcat\\" and \\"St. James Infirmary\\" with his orchestra, and also provides incidental music for the other performers. The film also features the Peters Sisters and tap dancers Miller Brothers and Lois. Plot Cab Calloway, an up and coming jazz musician is putting together a band, he was looking forward to make it big as the bandleader. His girlfriend Minnie, was upset that Cab has retained the services of a female band manager to help him promote his band and get his first big break. His band manager gets him a chance to audition his jazz octet before the local owner of the new club, which he then signs the big band for its opening. Minnie becomes suspicious and jealous that Nettie, as Cab's new female band manager, is doing good things for Cab and is winning points with him. When Cab auditions with his octet, the new club owner is impressed, but he said that he needs his band for his club opening to become more successful. He gets the job when he says that he can easily recruit more band members, and he opens for the new club for its opening at the end of the week. When he and his band make their success, Minnie gets intensely jealous and goes to a local \\"fix-it\\" man Boss Mason, who uses gun man Mo the Mouse as his 'assistant'. Minnie starts to play both sides of the fence in wanting to be his girlfriend, while also trying to keep Cab in place so that his relations with Nettie have \\"no chance to blossom\\".

A year after her launch she took part in the Battle of the Saintes. In 1801, she was part of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's reserve squadron at the Battle of Copenhagen, and so did not participate in the battle. In 1805, she was part of Admiral Robert Calder's fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Later in December of that year she was involved in towing to Spithead. On 10 August 1815, Warrior collided with the British merchant ship George in the Atlantic Ocean. George foundered with the loss of four lives. Warrior rescued her survivors. Warrior became a receiving ship in 1818, a prison ship after 1840, and was eventually broken up in 1857.

Description International Rescue Corps is an independent (i.e. non-governmental funded) United Nations registered disaster rescue service with an accredited UK National Open College Network qualification in Urban Search and Rescue. Being a charity, the IRC is supported entirely by donations from the public and sponsorship from industry. IRC members are unpaid volunteers and all the IRC's services are provided free of charge—the Corps' aim is purely to save life. The organisation is named after the fictional emergency-response organisation, International Rescue, in Gerry Anderson’s popular TV series, Thunderbirds. History The Corps was formed in 1981 in the aftermath of the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and became operational in 1985; it has since undertaken numerous missions at home and across the world. In many cases, missions are co-operative efforts working alongside other agencies both nationally and internationally. Over the last 25 years IRC has undertaken a variety of work both in the UK and abroad. Overseas missions include several earthquakes, hurricanes and subsequent floods, mudslides and logistical / aid work, whilst UK missions include gas explosions, train crashes, highline rescues, missing person searches and floods. Training and equipment Volunteers come from all walks of life. Initially, the Corps tended to just attract members of the emergency services (police, fire and ambulance) but today they also include council workers, union representatives, management consultants, engineers and many others. To carry out the Corps' role, operational members are required to satisfactorily complete a three-year training programme through the UK National Open College Network. Training consists of learning about earthquakes, specialist SAR (search and rescue) equipment, building construction, medical aid and casualty handling, boat handling, advanced rope skills, orienteering and map reading, helicopter coordination, Humanitarian Logistics and communications. Following the first year of training the member is able to participate in local and national missions in a support role; only after the full three years (with extensive assessments) will he/she be able to participate in overseas missions. They will then have one of the few recognised qualifications in Urban Search and Rescue in Europe. Equipment taken by the team will vary according to the nature of the disaster. Principal items include thermal image cameras, sound detectors, fibre-optic probes, portable generators and lights, cutting equipment, tents, fifteen days' supply of food and water purification equipment, thus allowing the team to operate without imposing any additional strain on the host country. Satellite communication systems enables the Corps to provide a reconnaissance and co-ordination service for the United Nations (UN) and other agencies if requested.

A gusset plate can be fastened to a permanent member either by bolts, rivets or welding or a combination of the three. They are used in bridges and buildings, as well as other structures. Materials Gusset plates are usually either made from cold rolled or galvanized steel, based upon their use. Galvanized steel offers more protection from rust, so this is usually used when the gusset plate is exposed to the elements. The gusset plate is usually painted to match nearby steel and fixtures and to give it an extra layer of protection. Occasionally gusset plates are made from copper or aluminum, but only with small structures that do not require much support. The copper and aluminum gusset plates also provide a more attractive finish for exposed structures. Uses Gusset plates securing riveted criss-crossing steel beams of the Eiffel Tower Gusset plates are used for various structures. Gusset plates are used to connect beams and columns together or to connect truss members. They can be either the only way of connecting the beam and columns or they can be used with bolts and welds. Gusset plates are therefore used in most metal weight-bearing structures, but the material and size of the gusset plate varies based on the structure. Bridges usually require thick sheets of steel for their gusset plates, but trusses sometimes only require small sheets of aluminium for their gusset plate. The size and strength of the gusset plate depends on size and the function of the structure. The larger the force on the connecting members, the larger the size of the gusset plate. Gusset plates provide an easy way to retrofit structures that can no longer safely support the applied loads. Design reconsideration A KT gusset plate Gusset plates can be made into a variety of shapes and sizes and from a range of materials. Gusset plates are usually square or rectangular, but can be triangular or made into a customized shape to fit the joint. The shape of each plate is designed so that welding or bolts can be applied to different edges of the plate. A gusset plate can form the entire connection or it can be used in conjunction with bolts or welds. There are several prominent connection types that include gusset plates, which include KT gusset plates, uniform force bracing connections, and bolt groups. A KT gusset plate connects several members together through one gusset plate. The gusset plate is welded to a beam, and then two or three columns, beams, or truss chord are connect to the other side of the gusset plate through bolts or welds. A uniform force bracing connection connects a beam, column, and one other member. The gusset plate is bolted to the column and welded to the beam. The connection of the last remaining member can be through either bolts or welds. Notable failures An animation showing the collapse of the Interstate 35-W Mississippi River bridge from a security camera  Steel bridges  The most notable bridge failure due to gusset plates is the collapse of I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota on August 1, 2007. Investigators found that the bridge had 16 under-designed gusset plates that all fractured and ripped, and that the remaining gusset plates were properly designed and remained intact. The 16 under-designed plates that failed were found to be only a 1/2 inch thick when they should have been thicker to be in accordance with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) “Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges”, 1961. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed most of the cause of the failure of the bridge to this flaw. In addition to the gusset plates being under-designed for their original loading, there were other factors that led to the demise: * At the time of the collapse of the bridge, approximately 300 tons of construction equipment was located near several of the under-designed gusset plates. * The bridge was completed in 1967, but in 1977 and 1998, a median barrier, larger outside walls, and a thicker concrete deck were added to the bridge, causing additional loading on the already under-designed gusset plates. * The temperature on the day of the collapse also could have introduced additional expansion stresses on the gusset plates, since the bearings on the bridge were partially \\"frozen\\" (due to corrosion, not temperature) limiting their effectiveness.  Radio telescopes  The current Green Bank Telescope at Green Bank, West Virginia, completed in 2000, was built following the collapse of the previous Green Bank telescope, a 90.44 m paraboloid erected in 1962. The previous telescope collapsed on 15 November 1988 due to the sudden loss of a gusset plate in the box girder assembly, which was a key component for the structural integrity of the telescope.NRAO 300 foot Telescope Collapse. Most radio and telecommunications dishes have gusset plates somewhere in their design, some designs more than others. As a general maintenance practice, these plates should be checked every two or three years, depending on the size of the dish.

His first wife was the daughter of Colonel Ichabod Crane; she mysteriously disappeared after taking a ferry from Staten Island to lower Manhattan and was presumed to have been murdered. Early life and Mexico Brannan was born in Washington, D.C., and was a messenger in the United States House of Representatives when he received his appointment to the United States Military Academy from Ratliff Boon, the U.S. Representative from Indiana in 1837. His appointment was supported by 114 other Congressmen. He finished West Point in 1841, ranking 23rd of 52 cadets, and was assigned to the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment.Eicher, p. 142. After graduation, Brannan served at Plattsburgh, New York, during the border dispute with Canada. During the Mexican–American War, Brannan was in the battles of Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, La Hoya, Contreras and Churubusco. He was brevetted to captain for gallantry for Contreras and Churubusco. He was severely wounded during the battle for Mexico City. After the war with Mexico, Brannan fought against the Seminoles. Brannan then remained in the Southeast at various posts until the beginning of the Civil War. Civil War service At the outbreak of the Civil War, Brannan was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers and placed in command of the Department of Key West. In October 1862, he fought in the Battle of Saint John's Bluff where he led infantry troops in the expedition on the St. Johns River against Confederate positions for control of Jacksonville, Florida. Also in the same month, Brannan was placed in command of the Department of the South (which at that time was co-terminus with the command of the X Corps) after Ormsby Mitchel's death. He was brevetted a lieutenant colonel for his service during the battle for Jacksonville, Florida. He served as department commander until January 1863. In 1863 he led an infantry division under Major General William Rosecrans in the Tullahoma Campaign where he fought at Hoover's Gap. Brannan then fought under Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas during the Chickamauga Campaign in the XIV Corps. At Chickamauga, Brannan lost 38 per cent of his command. Nevertheless, Brannan was awarded a brevet appointment to colonel for meritorious service. When Rosecrans was relieved by Ulysses S. Grant, Brannan was reassigned from infantry back to artillery. He was promoted to the rank of major in the regular army in August 1863. From October 1863 until June 1865, Brannan was chief of artillery of the Department of the Cumberland, where he oversaw the defenses at Chattanooga. He was in the Battle of Missionary Ridge and in the Atlanta Campaign where he participated in the Battle of Resaca, the Battle of Dallas and the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. He was also at the siege and surrender of Atlanta. He was appointed a brevet major general in both the regular army and in the volunteer forces for Gallant and Meritorious Services in the Atlanta Campaign and in the Field during the Rebellion. From July 10 to Sep. 25, 1865, Brannan was in command of the District of Savannah and the 1st Division, Department of Georgia, and of the District of Savannah from Oct. 5 to Dec. 19, 1865, and of the Department of Georgia from Dec. 19, 1865, to May 31, 1866. Postbellum career and death After the Civil War, Brannan mustered out of the volunteer forces and reverted to the regular army rank of major with the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment. He was assigned to artillery duties at Fort Trumbull, Connecticut, Fort Wadsworth, New York, and Ogdensburg, New York. While at Ogdensburg, he helped prevent the Fenian raids into Canada. In 1877, Brannan was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he helped put down the railroad riots. Brannan transferred to the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment in 1877. He retired from the army with the rank of colonel on April 19, 1882. He then moved to New York City. Brannan was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Brannan died in New York and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery. He was reinterred at the West Point Cemetery. Battery Brannan at Fort Worden, Washington, was named in his honor.

The television series first aired on Tuesday 21 November 2006 at the weekly time of 21:00 running a total of thirteen episodes. The series is now in re-runs and has an irregular running format. It follows the story of 50 chimpanzees, 26 gorillas, seven Baboons and four Mandrills who have been orphaned by the bush meat trade in Cameroon. It depicts the vital work of the Mefou National Park and the Limbe Wildlife Centre, along with Ape Action Africa (formerly the Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund) and \\"In Defence of Animals - Africa\\" - two charities that are dedicated to saving the primates in the region. Its narrator was Charlotte Uhlenbroek. A second series was being produced in 2008, but the series never made it to air. Characters * Rachel Hogan * Avi Sivan * Talilah * Babs the Vet Episodes Episode 1: Battlefront In this programme, cameras follow a team from the Limbe Wildlife Centre as they try to confiscate Alex, a 13-year-old chimp who has spent her life chained to a burnt out car. In Mefou National Park, sanctuary manager Rachel Hogan keeps vigil over a 1-year-old baby gorilla brought in, riddled with the shotgun pellets that killed his mother. Can the sanctuary find a hospital prepared to examine a gorilla and more importantly, can the gorilla find the will to live? Meanwhile, a tree collapses in a storm, crushing a fence of one of the forest enclosures, causing 19 chimpanzees escape. Surrounded by thousands of hectares of forest, the centre's staff has their work cut out. Episode 2: Knife Edge This programme closely follows Shufai, a baby gorilla who was orphaned by hunters who killed his mother for her meat. He's in desperate need of surgery but for vet Sheri Speede, conditions are basic - an emergency operation takes place on the kitchen table. An ex-gorilla hunter who has killed hundreds of the world's most endangered primates, goes undercover in one of Cameroon's bush meat markets. We also see how the keepers cope with trying to capture 19 escaped chimps back into the safety of their forest enclosure. Episode 3: Friend or Foe? In this episode of GOING APE, baby gorilla Shufai makes it back to the forest after his operation and for the first time since his mother was killed by hunters, he meets another gorilla. And it's a race to save Nino, a four-year-old chimpanzee who was savagely attacked by an older male grieving for his dead baby. Episode 4: Friend or Foe? Things take a turn for the worse when orphaned baby gorilla Shufai has a seizure. He's raced from the rainforest into the Cameroonian capital in search of medical help. He's got meningitis. At the Limbe Wildlife centre the illegal owner of a pet chimpanzee escapes prison by having to confront the facts of his crime. And after years of political wrangling, the Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund have the permission to move a group of chimps out of the city zoo and back into the forest. Episode 5: Hope GOING APE continues to follow the stories of the great ape orphans caught up in West Africa's illegal bush meat and pet trades. In this episode, viewers meet Gah, a baby chimp found paralysed in the back of a drug dealer's car. His plight seems hopeless but vet Felix Lankester has some unusual ways of trying to get the chimp to walk. On the edge of the rainforest in Mefou National Park, manager Rachel Hogan loses all faith in the experts when a team of firemen manage to destroy a year's work in one foul stroke. And after having half his face ripped off by an older male, four-year-old chimp Nino discovers he likes TV - something that helps him bond with Talila Sivan, director of the Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund. But the shy chimp causes trouble when he takes up refuge, eight feet high on an air conditioning unit - for four days! Episode 6: Help Nino, the chimpanzee whose face was ripped off by an older male chimp will die unless Vet Sheri Speede's appeal for international help is successful. Britain's top animal plastic surgeon may have a solution. Shufai, the baby gorilla blasted with shotgun pellets when hunters killed his mother, begins his separation from Rachel as he learns to be a gorilla once more. But it's not an easy journey for the one-year-old orphan. Episode 7: No Going Back Its 6 weeks since new chimp mum Yao and her baby Miko escaped from the safety of their sanctuary in Mefou National Park. They've been living in the surrounding forest, which is littered with the traps and snares of local villagers who rely on the forest for their food. But when they're finally caught, it all goes wrong for Miko. At the Sanaga Yong Chimpanzee Rescue Centre in the heart of the rain forest, they don't have the luxury of electricity. And that means an hour's drive on rough tracks to the nearest fridge where their medicines can be kept cool. But on a routine trip they arrive to find town closed. Baby gorilla Shufai leaves Rachel forever as he takes the next step on his journey back to the forest. Episode 8: Last Chance Chimpanzee Yao is a first time mum but a day's separation from her baby, Miko has led to her rejecting the little 12-week- old. Sanctuary staff do everything they can to reunite the pair and re-ignite Yoa's maternal instincts. But can they succeed. At the Limbe Wildlife Centre Gah, the chimp who was found paralysed in a drug smuggler's car faces the greatest test of his rehabilitation. Chimps are social animals so it's important he becomes part of a group but with only partial mobility how will he cope against the 2-year-old nursery bully, Eve? Also Alex, the chimpanzee who spent her whole life in solitude chained to a burnt out car meets Jo-Jo, a powerful, aggressive male. Episode 9: Facing Fear Sanctuary manager, Rachel Hogan is terrified. She can handle gorillas and chimpanzees without a problem, but in England she has to deliver a speech to more intimidating primates: ape experts from all over the world. Rejected baby chimp Miko begins life with a surrogate mother. And Nino, the chimpanzee whose face was ripped off by an older male is taken back to his group and the scene of the attack. He's always been withdrawn and no-one knows how he will react. The journey makes him panic so it's not looking good by the time the door is opened onto his enclosure and his old friends.  Episode 10: Eating Apes Eating apes is not only acceptable in parts of the world; it's a status symbol. Vet Sheri Speede wants to challenge people's attitudes and uses music to spread the message that if people don't stop eating chimpanzees and gorillas, they will be extinct in 15 years. A lot has to change. As one ape meat seller says, it might be sad that my children won't know what these creatures look like but I have no other way to make my living. And while Sheri is away from her sanctuary at Sanaga Yong, one of her chimps escapes. It's a race to get him back behind the safety of the 9v electrified fence. The surrounding forest is home to wild chimps who won't take kindly to a strange male in their territory. If they see him, they're likely to kill him. Episode 11: Free At Last Bertie & Ashmael are two chimpanzees who have had an awful life. After their parents were slaughtered in front of them they were sold as pets. Most likely to make him submissive, Bertie had his ears sliced off. When the pair became too big and too much to handle they were dumped at the city zoo and there they lived for 10 years, in a tiny concrete cell. But today they're about to be released into a huge, new forest enclosure. How will they react? It's not how you'd think. And at the Limbe Wildlife Centre the government have just delivered two confiscated pet primates: a psychotic adult baboon tied up in a tiny cage and a miserable female chimpanzee chained to a log. But the sanctuary has a problem: they're full. Episode 12: When They're Gone Caroline is a chimpanzee who is dying. She's in urgent need of help but it's help that no-one is prepared to give her. She needs to be scanned to find out what's wrong but in Africa the only places with the right equipment are hospitals and they simply won't accept non-human primates. Vet technician Babila Tafon and Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund Director, Talila Sivan fight for her rights and for her life. And there's a new vet in the forest. She's never been to Africa and she's never touched an ape but no sooner has she arrived than Kim Damme is faced with an emergency. She learns pretty quickly what it means to be a vet in the jungle. Episode 13: A New Life In the last episode of a moving series Rachel is out buying a pregnancy test kit. But it's not for her, it's for her oldest gorilla, Gerry. You have to feel sorry for Bruno her keeper though, he's the one left to get the gorilla's urine sample. Rachel has mixed feelings about the test results. Two pet chimpanzees are rescued from their isolated lives of misery and torment. They meet at the Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund's forest sanctuary in Mefou National Park. Theirs is a story to warm even the coldest of hearts. And Shufai, the one year old gorilla, starts life in the nursery. When he arrived 3 months ago he was nearly dead, riddled with a hunter's shotgun pellets. His name means 'courageous one' and as he walks into an enclosure full of gorillas for the first time, you can see it's a name that fits.

The underside of the cap is typical of the genus Pluteus — the gills are pale, soon becoming pink when the spores ripen. But the upper surface is a bright tawny or olivaceous yellow. The species name leoninus (meaning leonine) refers to this cap colour. Description This description is combined from several references. *The golden to olive-yellow convex cap is 3–7 cm in diameter, is hygrophanous, and usually has a grooved edge. The darker central disc has a slight velvety tomentum. *The gills are yellowish at first, then salmon pink (the colour of the spore powder). *The stipe is up to about 7 cm, often striate, being white to cream, and often darker near the base. *The mushroom grows on stumps and wood debris of broad-leaved trees and sometimes of conifers. *At the microscopic level, the filamentous cap cuticle is a trichoderm. The gills have scanty bladder-shaped pleurocystidia, and abundant fusiform cheilocystidia. The spores are smooth, almost globular, approximately 7×6 μm.

In 2009 fair attendance had declined to 217,000 visitors.The Future of the Michigan State Fair The state fair was not held in the following two years. On April 9, 2012, Governor Rick Snyder signed Senate Bill 515 and House Bill 4803, which would authorize the transfer of the fairgrounds land to the Land Bank Fast Track Authority, which would oversee the land for future development, including plans for a station for the proposed commuter rail service. As the agricultural industry is Michigan's second leading economic industry, many people were disturbed by the failure of the state to support a state fair. They organized Great Lakes Agricultural Fair, a 501 C (3) organization, in 2011 to ensure such events continued. The Great Lakes State Fair took place August 31 through September 3, 2012, at the Suburban Collection Showplace in the Detroit suburb of Novi. In 2013, Fifth Third Bank became the name sponsor, so the event was called the Fifth Third Bank Michigan State Fair, again held in Novi at the Suburban Collection Showplace. Organizing the fair was taken over by Michigan State Fair LLC. Seven years later, a virtual fair was held as live shows & others were cancelled caused by COVID-19 pandemic.

In late 1869, Joseph boarded a whites-only car of Mobile's Washington Avenue Railroad. He was forcibly ejected and brought a case against the conductor, John Bailey, for assault. The judge in the case, Cleveland F. Moulton, noted that the right of a railroad to have segregated cars was recognized by common law in England and the US, and that Joseph was only possibly the victim of assault on the basis of how he was ejected from the car, as the rightness of his ejection was not in question.

Career John Blacking was born in Guildford, Surrey, and was educated at Salisbury Cathedral School and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was a pupil of the illustrious anthropologist, Meyer Fortes. After serving with the British Army in Malaysia, he was employed by Hugh Tracey in the International Library of African Music (ILAM) and further studied music and culture of the Venda people in South Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965 he was awarded a Ph.D. (D Litt, rather) from the University of the Witwatersrand for his work on Venda children's songs, and in the same year he was made Professor and Head of the Department of Social Anthropology. In the field of ethnomusicology, Blacking is known for his early and energetic advocacy of an anthropological perspective in the study of music (others are David McAllester [1916–2006] and Alan Merriam [1923–1980]). He spent most of his later academic career at Queen's University Belfast, in Northern Ireland, where he was professor of social anthropology from 1970 until his death in 1990. Many of his ideas about the social impact of music can be found in his 1973 book How Musical is Man?. In this highly influential book, Blacking called for a study of music as \\"Humanly Organized Sound\\" (that's the title of Chapter One), arguing that \\"it is the activities of Man the Music Maker that are of more interest and consequence to humanity than the particular musical achievements of Western man\\",Blacking 1973, p. 4. and that \\"no musical style has 'its own terms': its terms are the terms of its society and culture\\".Blacking 1973, pp. 16f. His other books include Venda Children's Songs (1967), one of the first ethnomusicological works to focus directly on the interpenetration of music and culture, Anthropology of the Body (London:Academic Press,1977) and A Commonsense View of All Music: reflections on Percy Grainger's contribution to ethnomusicology and music education (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989). The Callaway Centre in University of Western Australia holds an archive of his field notes and tapes, the John Blacking Collection. He wrote and presented a series, Dancing, for Ulster Television. John Blacking House was named in Belfast, in honour of his involvement with the Open Door Housing Association. He died in Belfast. Works * Blacking, John. 1954.

This species has two subspecies: Erysimum baeticum bastetanum is found only in the Sierra de Baza (Granada province), inhabiting the subalpine pine forests, from 1500 to 2000 m. a.s.l.. Erysimum baeticum baeticum is a subspecies endemic to the eastern range of the Sierra Nevada (Almería province), inhabiting subalpine shrublands. Both subspecies flower during late May thru early July, displaying up to one hundred showy purple flowers arranged in several short stalks. Life cycle Plants germinates during early spring (March to early May), and usually grow for 2–3 years as vegetative rosettes. Much mortality occurs at this stage due to summer drought. Surviving individuals flower during their second year. Erysimum baeticum bastetanum is monocarpic, most individuals dying after flowering. Erysimum baeticum baeticum is mostly polycarpic, since an important proportion of individuals reproduce more than once. Morphology Reproductive plants produce one to eight reproductive stalks. Each flowering stalk can display between 5 and more than one hundred bright purple, hermaphroditic, slightly protandrous flowers arranged in corimbous inflorescences. Flowering stalks are tall (circa 1 m tall) in E. baeticum bastetatum, and very short (around 20 cm tall) in Erysimum baeticum baeticum. Flowers produce minute amount of nectar in four nectaries. Flower shape is extremely variable, ranging from radially to bilaterally symmetric even in the same population. Pollination biology Information of pollination biology exists only for Erysimum baeticum baeticum. Flowers are visited by over 50 species of insects belonging to the order Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Heteroptera. Abundant pollinators are the beetles Melighetes maurus (Nitidulidae), Dasytes subaeneus (Dasytidae), and Malachius laticollis (Malachidae), the solitary bees Anthophora leucophaea (Anthophoridae) and Colletes sp (Colletidae), and the ants Proformica longiseta, Lasius niger and Cataglyphis velox (Formicidae). However, ants can act both as true pollinators and as nectar robbers. Herbivory In southeastern Spain, reproductive individuals are consumed by many different species of herbivores, although more information is required. Some floral buds do not open because they are galled by flies (Dasineura sp., Cecidomidae). Several species of sap-suckers (primarily the bugs Eurydema oleraceae, E. fieberi, E. ornata, and Corimeris denticulatus) feed on the reproductive stalks during flowering and fruiting. In addition, stalks are bored into by a weevil species (presumably Lixus ochraceus, Curculionidae), which consumes the inner tissues, whereas another weevil species ( presumably Ceutorhynchus, Curculionidae) develops inside the fruits, living on developing seeds and acting as predispersal seed predators. The stalks are browsed by Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica, Bovidae), which consume flowers and mostly green fruits. Dispersed seeds are consumed by woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus, Muridae), several species of birds (Fringilla coelebs, Serinus serinus, and Carduelis cannabina Fringillidae, among others), several species of medium- sized granivorous beetles (Iberozabrus sp. Carabidae, among others), and ants (Lasius niger, Tetramorium caespitum, Cataglyphis velox and Leptothorax tristis). These animals feed on the seeds from late August to early April. Seedlings and juveniles are sometime injured by ibex, sheep, wild boars (Sus scrofa, Suidae), hares (Lepus granatense, Leporidae), and voles (Pitimys spp., Arvicolidae), although most seedlings die due to summer drought and seed quality.

From 1886 to 1898, the cemetery also engaged in a struggle against the District of Columbia and the United States Congress, which wanted construct a major thoroughfare (North Capitol Street) through the center of the cemetery. This led to the passage of an Act of Congress, the declaration of a federal law to be unconstitutional, the passage of a second Act of Congress, a second major court battle, and the declaration by the courts that the city's eminent domain procedures were unconstitutional. North Capitol Street was built, and the cemetery compensated fairly for its property. In the 20th century, Prospect Hill Cemetery sold unneeded land, demolished its chapel, and reoriented the cemetery's main entrance toward North Capitol Street and away from Lincoln Road NE. Established as a burying ground for members of the Lutheran faith, it gradually became a secular cemetery. Prospect Hill remains an active cemetery, and continues to accept burials. Founding of the cemetery and management issues=Founding the cemetery The German Evangelical Church Society of Concordia Church (pictured) bought and founded Prospect Hill Cemetery. The German Evangelical Lutheran Church was organized by German immigrants to Washington, D.C., on January 27, 1833. The small Lutheran and Reformed congregation first worshipped at City Hall along with Catholics and Jews. In 1853, the Reformed and Lutheran elements of the congregation erected a church building at 20th and G Streets NW and changed the name of the congregation to Concordia Church. The growth in the church was due to the burgeoning German community in the city as well as the influence of Reverend Samuel D. Finkle (or Finckel), who assumed the pulpit on December 27, 1846. The church had a small burying ground adjacent to it. The congregants soon built a parsonage and parochial school, and established a German Evangelical Church Society in 1847 to assist with administration, fundraising, and other church affairs. In 1858, the German Evangelical Church Society decided to purchase a cemetery for Concordia Church. The society bought a site, but then discovered that the title to it was not clear. A second site was then sought. Seventeen acres of Moore's Farm, located in the Glenwood neighborhood (now known as Edgewood), were purchased for $7,000 ($ in dollars) on September 23, 1858. Title in the land was invested in two members of the German Evangelical Church Society, although the deed of transfer specified that the title should be transferred to an appropriate corporate organization once a charter was obtained from Congress (which, at that time, chartered corporations in the District of Columbia). The whites-only cemetery was dedicated on September 26, 1858, with a parade featuring a band and three German membership associations. Reverend Finkle, who led the ceremonies and blessed the grounds, declared the cemetery open to all classes and members of any religious sect. Construction of the cemetery Curving paths, trees, and landscaping are typical of Prospect Hill Cemetery's \\"garden cemetery\\" design. It is not clear why the cemetery was named Prospect Hill. The name was a common one for cemeteries in the mid-1800s, but the District of Columbia Preservation Review Board suggests that the name was probably inspired by the burying ground's location. Prospect Hill Cemetery is indeed on high ground, and it has excellent views of the United States Capitol and the adjacent neighborhoods of Eckington and Bloomingdale. (It also has a superb view of the Washington Monument, although the monument was not complete at the time the cemetery was founded.) Prospect Hill was designed as a garden cemetery (also known as a rural cemetery). Until the early 1800s, most burying grounds (the word \\"cemetery\\" did not come into use in the United States until the 1840s) were next to churches. They were very overcrowded and unhealthy, with graves stacked upon each other or emptied and reused for new burials. As a reaction to the urban cemetery, the first \\"garden\\" cemetery—Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris—opened in 1804. The concept quickly spread across Europe. Garden/rural cemeteries did not have to be outside the city limits. When land within a city could be found, the cemetery was enclosed with a wall to give it a garden-like quality. These cemeteries were often not sectarian, nor co-located with a house of worship. Inspired by the English landscape garden movement, they often looked like attractive parks. The first garden/rural cemetery in the United States was Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston, Massachusetts, founded by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in 1831. It was followed by Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia in 1836, and Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn in 1838. Prospect Hill was designed as a typical garden cemetery, with winding roads and paths, a high stone wall, and (in time) many trees and bushes. Its main entrance was on Lincoln Road. The cemetery's most prominent feature was an ellipse, bounded on the outer edge by a road and featuring two paths: one an inner, oval path paralleling the road and the other a straight, cruciform path. The ellipse was aligned with Lincoln Road, and most burials here faced east. The District of Columbia Preservation Review Board has described the layout of the cemetery as \\"characteristic and a relatively early example of the garden cemeteries created in the United States beginning in the 1830s\\". According to the Historic American Landscapes Survey, Prospect Hill Cemetery, along with Glenwood Cemetery (1854) and Mount Olivet Cemetery (1858), \\"changed the dynamics of cemeteries in the city\\" by setting a new standard for cemetery design and layout. Initially, Prospect Hill Cemetery featured two structures, a small farmhouse (used as the resident superintendent's house) and a barn. Both predated the establishment of the cemetery. In 1873, a gatehouse designed by August Schoenborn, a noted German-American architect who lived in the city, was built near the main gate on Lincoln Road. Most of the early burials at Prospect Hill were reinterments of remains from the Concordia Church cemetery. A marker inscribed with a death date of 1844 represents the oldest burial at the cemetery, but is a reinterment. Many of the mausolea and markers reflect the styles of adjacent Glenwood Cemetery, established in 1854. The earliest mausolea are the Abner and Baumann structures, which are in the northern part of the cemetery on the slope facing the North Capitol Street gate. The 1860 charter On June 13, 1860, Congress approved a corporate charter for the Prospect Hill Cemetery corporation (PHC). The legislation named eight members of the German Evangelical Church Society as incorporators of \\"Prospect Hill Cemetery\\": Christopher Friess, John Guttensohn, Friedrich \\"Fred\\" Heider, Augustus E.L. Keese, B. Ostermeyer, George Schultz, John G. Stork, and John Walter. The charter allowed PHC to hold up to but not less than of contiguous land as a cemetery in perpetuity. Section 3 of the charter specifically forbade the construction of any new street, alley, or canal through the property. The new corporation was to be led by a president, secretary, and six directors, who were to be elected annually by majority vote of the shareholders. The shareholders included the eight incorporators and each lotholder (who received a single vote, no matter how large their lot). The board of directors had the ability to appoint individuals to vacancies between elections. Management struggles and the 1886 charter amendment Management of Prospect Hill Cemetery was haphazard in its early years. Only seven directors (which included the president and secretary) were elected rather than the required eight, and the real decision maker governing the burial ground was the German Evangelical Church Society (which changed its name numerous times during the next 30 years). Furthermore, title to the cemetery was not immediately conveyed to the new corporation, as required by the deed of transfer. (Transfer did not occur until June 10, 1873.) Fundraisers to benefit the cemetery were held in June 1865 and May 1866.; Senator John James Ingalls sponsored the legislation that amended the cemetery's charter in 1886. In 1867, PHC reported that it received income of $1,500 ($ in dollars) in the past six months, expended $500 in improvements and repairs, and was in excellent financial condition. The board elected that year included August Meiners, president; John Vogt, vice president; Frederick Schweiring, secretary; Michael Langman, treasurer; and Christopher Freiss, F. Haiden, Christopher Just, H. Kaiser, John Killian, and August Lipold. By 1870, however, the cemetery faced a problem: A significant number of individuals had purchased lots but failed to pay. Beginning on February 9, 1870, PHC announced that lotholders in arrears must complete payment by June 30, or the cemetery would seize their lot and sell to it to someone else. Nearly all lot sales in the past had been to members of the German Evangelical Church Society, but now sales to non-members, including many who were neither German nor Lutheran, expanded rapidly. Throughout most of the 1870s, the cemetery's superintendent was Christopher Buechler. Internal struggles at PHC began in the late 1870s, and culminated in 1885. The issue was that Concordia Church and the German Evangelical Church Society controlled the cemetery association, even though few members owned lots. Other lotholders were denied the right to vote at annual meetings, and many suspected that cemetery income was being diverted to church use. These \\"independent\\" lotholders marshaled sufficient votes in 1884 to force the appointment of a committee to study the issue and make recommendations to the lotholders the following year. The committee failed to report in February 1885, and a resolution was adopted by the lotholders to force it to make a report and recommendations in 1886. In March 1885, an agreement was reached in which Concordia Church and the German Evangelical Church Society conceded that the independent lotholders had the right to vote. Implementing the agreement required a change to the charter, however. Independent lotholder Simon Wolf successfully petitioned Senator John James Ingalls (R-Kansas) to introduce legislation in the 49th United States Congress to amend the PHC charter to reaffirm the rights of lotholders. The bill was favorably reported out of the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia on March 30, and passed the full Senate on June 17. The legislation (S. 1187) amended the cemetery's charter so that the cemetery corporation was not permitted to hold more than and not less than , and affirmed that the core of the cemetery could never be sold or used for any purpose other than a burial ground. The bill also affirmed the right of all lotholders (not just those associated with Concordia Church or the German Evangelical Church Society) to vote at annual meetings and hold office, provided new rules for managing the annual meeting and casting votes, directed the cemetery to use its income solely for the benefit of the burying ground, and expanded the board of directors to nine directors (each of which had to be elected annually by a majority of lotholders). Although the Commissioners of the District of Columbia initially did not oppose the bill, on June 26 they asked the Senate to table the bill and decline to send it to the United States House of Representatives for action. The city was contemplating extending North Capitol Street past Boundary Avenue (now Florida Avenue) to the United States Soldiers' Home (about double its existing length), and the provision of the bill which prevented use of the Prospect Hill Cemetery grounds for any purpose other than a cemetery interfered with the street's proposed route. The Senate, however, did not table the bill and the House approved it unaltered. In elections held after the charter amendment, five of the board members belonged to the German Evangelical Church Society and three to independent lotholders. Fight for control of the cemetery The City Commissioners, however, were undeterred in their desire to extend North Capitol Street. Although they knew federal law prohibited the use of cemetery land, on November 5, 1886, the commissioners claimed to have contacted the lotholders, a large majority of whom were said to favor the donation of cemetery land for the road. The commissioners had city legal counsel study whether they could condemn the land and accept it as a donation (as Congress had appropriated no money for the city to pay for the property). The city's chief attorney, Albert G. Riddle, reported that federal law barred the city from condemning the property. The only alternatives were for every single lotholder to give their approval for a donation of land or for the city to ask Congress to revise the corporation's charter. With neither option likely to happen, Commissioners William B. Webb and Samuel E. Wheatley agreed to cancel the extension of North Capitol Street. Founding of a competing corporation Control over Prospect Hill Cemetery began to be contested in December 1886. Dissatisfaction with the 1885 agreement grew among members of the German Evangelical Church Society (now known as the German Evangelical Society), many of whom supported the extension of North Capitol Street. This group subsequently decided to seize control of the cemetery. They incorporated a \\"German Evangelical Society of Prospect Hill Cemetery\\" (GESPHC) on December 16, 1986, and the following day met with trustees John Walter and Frederick Heider of Prospect Hill Cemetery. Walker and Heider conveyed title to the cemetery to the GESPHC that same day. On March 17, 1887, the GESPHC filed a plan with the city to subdivide the cemetery. The west of the proposed North Capitol Street route was severed from the cemetery, and the GESPHC further subdivided this section into building lots. This not only subjected these to taxation, but allegedly made it legal for the city to condemn the route through it needed to extend North Capitol Street. With no burials having been made in plots which could be condemned by the city, the GESPHC trustees believed that the subdivision cleared the way for the city to build the street. (More than 4,000 burials had occurred east of the planned street.) Despite these actions, the city did not act on the North Capitol Street extension until the end of the year. In the fall of 1887, the city proposed taking a wide strip of land through the cemetery to extend North Capitol Street. The city's hearing on the extension occurred on November 11, 1887, and PHC directors Fred Heider, H. Lereker, William Scherzer, Sebastian Toepfer, and George C. Walker attended the hearing. There were no objections raised to the route or extension. There were, however, local landowners who did not approve of the street extension. On December 14, Mrs. Annie E. Barbour, whose of property lay adjacent to the south side of the cemetery, filed suit against the city—arguing that the city commissioners did not have the funds to pay for her land, and that the city intended to take her property without due process or compensation. Alarmed that the city was ignoring federal law barring the construction of roads through their property, PHC also filed for an injunction to stop the city from taking action. PHC claimed it had not voiced opposition to the road extension because it assumed the commissioners knew an act of Congress prevented the road from going through cemetery land. It also pointed out that three burial plots had already been sold on the west side of the planned route. The superior court granted the PHC's injunction on December 17. Desecration of the cemetery and aftermath Colonel William Ludlow, who gave the orders to have trees chopped down at the cemetery despite a court order protecting the grounds. On December 14, City Engineer Commissioner Colonel William Ludlow issued verbal orders to George M. Beale, D.C. superintendent of roads, to begin work on extending North Capitol Street. Three days later, the D.C. Superior Court issued an injunction stopping all work on the road. Although subsequent events are unclear, later congressional testimony suggested that the injunction was served only on Commissioner Webb, not all three commissioners. Webb may have referred the injunction to the District's assistant counsel, H.E. Davis, but neither individual informed Ludlow. On December 23, seven workmen entered the cemetery and tore down fences, chopped down 12 trees, and uprooted shrubs. The cemetery superintendent, Henry Winckelman, attempted to stop them but was unable to do so. Davis allegedly told Ludlow of the injunction late in the afternoon on December 23, and Ludlow verbally told Beale to stop work a few hours later. Officers of the PHC complained to city officials, and on December 29 Commissioner Wheatley issued a written order to Beale to stop work. After the city's desecration of the cemetery, independent directors on the PHC board learned of the formation of the GESPHC and the transfer of the cemetery's title by the other board members. They were outraged. Independent board member John Vogt asserted that the trustees had no authority to file for a subdivision, and that lotholders were almost unanimous in opposing the transfer of title. At a special meeting of the Prospect Hill Cemetery lotholders held on January 5, 1888, the 400 lotholders present elected a new president (Charles A. Bickwedde) and a new secretary (Leonhardt Eckert). With title to the cemetery in question, lots could not be sold and income plummeted. A financial committee, consisting of members Jacob J. Appich, W. Grisbauer, Charles Groff, Frederick Reh, and Charles Schneider, was established to support the cemetery. It immediately raised $500.50 ($ in dollars) in donations. A second committee, consisting of members William Dietz, Jacob Rupid, Charles Schneider, L.H. Schneider, August Schmedtie, and George Wagner, was appointed to provide support and advice to the board of directors. A committee on resolutions was also formed, consisting of members Frederick Imhoff, L.H. Schneider, and George Wagner. At the end of the special meeting, the committee on resolutions reported out a series of resolutions denouncing the city's desecration of the cemetery; declaring the city's action illegal and taken in support of a real estate syndicate which sought to profit from the street extension; asking the PHC board of directors to sue the city commissioners civilly and criminally; and establishing a committee to meet with House and Senate District Committees, the President of the United States, and the city commissioners to inform them of the events of the past two years. L.H. Schneider successfully amended one resolution to denounce the six men who filed incorporated the GESPHC and subdivided the cemetery. Each resolution passed overwhelmingly. The board of directors of the PHC filed suit against GESPHC, John Walter, and Frederick Heider on January 25, 1888. They accused the organization and two men of seeking to seize the cemetery's revenues, conflicts of interest, illegally transferring title to the cemetery, and illegally subdividing the cemetery. The GESPHC countersued, arguing that the PHC had never been duly organized under the charter of 1860. Even if it had, the GESPHC said, the PHC's actions were tainted and irregular due to the voting rights given to individuals who were not members of the German Evangelical Society. Congressional investigation Within days of the PHC lotholders' special meeting, Representative John J. Hemphill (D-South Carolina) introduced a resolution to have the House Committee on the District of Columbia investigate the matter and report to Congress any attempts to violate federal law. The resolution was favorably reported out of the House Committee on the District of Columbia, and adopted by the full House. A special subcommittee of the District of Columbia Committee was established to oversee the investigation. Prospect Hill graves. The special subcommittee met for the first time on March 3, 1888, and heard testimony in the matter its first day. PHC director L.H. Schneider testified about the organization's 1860 charter, the 1886 amendments to the charter, and Section 3's bar against the construction of roads in the cemetery. Schneider also testified that the city commissioners were well aware of Section 3's prohibition on new roads. City Commissioner Webb reviewed for the subcommittee the city's initial attempt to extend North Capitol Street in late 1886. He noted that the commissioners did not approve construction at that time, as federal law appeared to bar it. Webb claimed that the GESPHC approached the city with news of the subdivision and their willingness to allow the city to cut the road. The city commissioners told the GESPHC that the organization had no authority to subdivide the cemetery or donate any burial ground, and that the city commissioners had never approved the street's extension. Webb claimed that Colonel Ludlow had illegally issued orders sending work crews into the cemetery. Superintendent of Roads Beale testified that Colonel Ludlow verbally ordered him to begin work on December 14, that no countermanding order was ever received, and that work began on the cemetery grounds on December 23. The work ceased at the end of that day when Ludlow phoned to tell him to stop. Beale also told the subcommittee that it was not until December 29 that Commissioner Wheatley issued a written order to stop work. The special subcommittee heard from Colonel Ludlow on March 9. Ludlow flatly contradicted Commissioner Webb, and produced documentation showing that the three commissioners had formally taken action in early December to approve the road extension. Although Webb claimed he verbally informed Ludlow about the injunction the day it was issued, Ludlow denied knowing about it until Davis verbally informed him of its existence on December 23. When asked why the city commissioners took action despite clear congressional instructions prohibiting road-building on Prospect Hill Cemetery's land, Ludlow said that the actions of the GESPHC seemed to dispose of that bar. Simon Wolf, who petitioned Congress to make the 1886 charter amendments, testified that a man claiming to be from a \\"Philadelphia real estate syndicate\\" approached him at the U.S. Capitol, threatened him, and told him to not seek the charter amendments. Ludlow, however, categorically denied knowledge of any such syndicate. George Schaffer testified last, admitting that he prepared the paperwork creating the subdivision just prior to the end of his term as PHC president, and that such filings were properly undertaken under his authority as president. Unable to determine which faction truly represented the PHC, and not wishing to interfere in the court proceedings then ongoing, the subcommittee took no more testimony. A report was ready to be presented to the full House District Committee on April 3, 1888. The report absolved the city commissioners of any wrongdoing, and refused to take a side in the litigation. But a quorum of subcommittee members did not exist, and the report was not presented. A quorum was reached on April 6. But no vote to accept the report was taken, as there were concerns as to whether the December 17 injunction had been properly served on the commissioners. This legal question was resolved, and on April 20 the full committee voted to accept the report. No further action was taken, however. Court proceedings Dueling boards of directors were elected by the PHC and the GESPHC in March 1988,; ; but the Court of the District of Columbia in Equity enjoined the GESPHC from taking any action regarding the property, income, or title of Prospect Hill Cemetery. The PHC continued to elect a board of directors, however, in 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892, and 1893.; ; ; ; After nearly four years of court hearings, testimony, and motions, the Court of the District of Columbia in Equity found in favor of the PHC on November 22, 1892. It declared the transfer of title in December 1886 illegal, and ordered the March 1886 subdivision filing dissolved. The court also dismissed the GESPHC's countersuit. The German Evangelical Society appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. It gave three grounds for appeal: 1) That the court in equity had erred in finding the PHC properly incorporated under the 1860 charter; 2) that the court in equity had erred in denying a November 17, 1892, motion to amend the countersuit; and 3) that the court in equity had erred when it found that non-members of the Society were voting members of the PHC. The Court of Appeals, however, dismissed the first and third grounds. Under the rules of the court, the Society (as appellant) was required to have printed the testimony and proceedings of the initial court. The Society had declined to do so, and the court of appeals concluded that it could not find in favor of the appellant without any printed record. The key question in answering the remaining issue, the court of appeals said, was whether the 1886 entity calling itself the \\"German Evangelical Society\\" was, in fact, the same voluntary, unincorporated body which formed the PHC in 1860. The court said it was not and could never be, since as a matter of law it was a completely new entity. The charter of 1860, as amended, gave no voting rights to any outside organization, only to lotholders. Nor did the charter require lotholders to be members of the German Evangelical Society, whether the society of 1860 or the newly incorporated body of 1886. The court in equity, then, was right in denying the November 17, 1892, motion to amend, for this motion would have given the 1886 body voting rights and standing in the PHC annual meeting. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of the District of Columbia in Equity on February 5, 1894. Extension of North Capitol Street=Congressional activity, 1891 to 1893 Map of the Edgewood neighborhood in 1890, showing Prospect Hill Cemetery and the completed portions of North Capitol Street (except those through the Barbour estate and cemetery). The 51st United States Congress ran from March 4, 1889, to March 3, 1891. Regarding the extension of North Capitol Street, the key issue facing Congress was amending the Prospect Hill Cemetery charter to either allow the cemetery association to donate land to the city or permit the city to condemn the land. On April 22, 1890, the Senate added an amendment to the District of Columbia appropriations bill which would allow a land transfer. The House District of Columbia Committee favorably reported a standalone bill on April 24. The Senate refused to act on the standalone bill because the House had refused to act on the D.C. appropriations bill. To get movement on the legislation, the city commissioners held a hearing to generally discuss and consider street extensions throughout the city. PHC representative George Wagner accused the commissioners of trying to win public support for the North Capitol Street extension by cloaking it as a \\"general hearing\\", and the PHC board showed up in force at the hearing to protest the extension of North Capitol Street. No further action was taken on the bill in the remainder of the 51st Congress, and it died at the end of the session. The 52nd United States Congress opened on December 7, 1891, and ended on March 3, 1893. Initially, no legislation was introduced in Congress. The commissioners of the District of Columbia tried to force the issue by holding hearings on the street extension issue on May 22, 1891. The PHC's attorney, Henry Wise Garnett, reminded the commissioners of the bar in federal law preventing any action, and the commissioners decided to wait until Congress acted. In the waning days of 1891, a new bill, S.1307, was introduced with substantially the same language as the 1890 bill. This bill was drawn up by the Washington Board of Trade (a business group). On January 25, the city commissioners held a hearing on the bill. George Wagner and August Schmedtie, representatives of the PHC, objected to any congressional action until the court ruled on which organization held title to the cemetery. Congress, however, was not deterred. Two new bills, S.2637 and H.B.7407, were introduced in Congress in July 1892. Senator John Sherman (R-Ohio) authored the Senate legislation, which allowed the cemetery land to be condemned, the price of the condemnation to be paid from the United States Treasury, and the grading of the road to occur (although the construction cost was capped at $10,000). The House bill was substantially the same. The Senate passed a resolution asking the city to estimate the cost of construction for the street extension. Captain William Trent Rossell, the Engineer Commissioner, reported that the city needed of land for the road, of which belonged to the cemetery. Rossell estimated the value of the land at 30 cents per square foot, or $38,036.70 ($ in dollars). Grading of the land would require another $69,286 ($ in dollars). The PHC, for its part, was in good financial shape (despite sharply lower lot sales and interments due to the ongoing lawsuit). Many lotholders no longer felt the cemetery was in danger of being moved or wiped out, and there was some support for letting the road go through. A committee of three, led by director Charles Schneider, was appointed investigate the matter and report back to lotholders. Meanwhile, condemnation proceeded against other property owners in the area. At this time, the eminent domain procedures governing the District of Columbia required the city to condemn land, and for the landowner to fight the condemnation in court before a jury. The jury then determined if the condemnation was required, and what compensation should be awarded the property owner. In two separate proceedings, juries found land to be worth just 1 cent per square foot. Senator James McMillan (R-Michigan), chair of the Senate District of Columbia Committee, brought S.2637 to the floor of the Senate on June 24. McMillan argued that the cemetery trustees were not opposed to the road, just to the price to be paid for the condemned land. Senator George Graham Vest (D-Missouri) asked that the bill be temporarily tabled, and it was. On July 14, Senator Matt Whitaker Ransom (D-North Carolina) presented the Senate with a petition from 1,000 cemetery lotholders opposed to the Senate and House bills. (PHC director George Wagner later characterized the dispute over lotholder support as one Senator lying to another.) The objections raised by Vest and other senators were seemingly resolved by July 24, when McMillan again called the bill for a vote on the Senate floor. One change to the bill had been made, providing for federally-financed construction of a retaining wall on cemetery property if one was needed. But once more the bill was put on hold. Senator David Turpie (D-Indiana) objected to the bill overall, and Senator Francis Cockrell (D-Missouri) wanted a cap put on the price of the compensation. Looking northwest out the current main gates of the cemetery. The housing development beyond North Capitol Street was once cemetery land. On November 22, 1892, the District of Columbia Court in Equity ruled in favor of the PHC trustees. In December 1892, Charles Schneider's investigative committee reported back to the lotholders. He reported that the board of directors was still opposed to the construction of North Capitol Street across cemetery land. If Congress acted and stripped the cemetery of its rights, however, the investigative committee urged that the lotholders seek a fair price for the land (one much higher than the 1 cent per square foot offered other property owners). At a special meeting on December 7, the lotholders voted in favor of the report and to support the board of directors. In a desperate attempt to win passage of the stalled legislation, the city commissioners held yet another hearing in the waning days of the 52nd Congress. The January 15th hearing was cancelled when the commissioners were unexpectedly called to Capitol Hill to testify. But PHC representatives noted that lobbyists for real estate syndicates showed up in large numbers for the hearing. The hearing was eventually held on January 23, but there was no new evidence or testimony offered and the stalemate continued. Meanwhile, Congress approved an amendment to the charter of the Eckington and Soldiers' Home Railway, an electric streetcar company providing service in the Eckington neighborhood. The first electric streetcar company in the city, it began at the intersection of New Jersey Avenue NW and New York Avenue NW, ran north on New Jersey Avenue to Rhode Island Avenue NW, and then up 4th Street NW to Michigan Avenue NW (passing between Howard University and the McMillan Reservoir). Legislation to permit the streetcar company to extend its line along New York Avenue to North Capitol Street and then up North Capitol to the Soldier's Home was first introduced in Congress in December 1889, and was finally approved in February 1893.; ; ; ; ; ; ; The 53rd United States Congress opened on August 7, 1893, and ended on March 3, 1895. Democrats now held a majority in the Senate, and on August 30, 1893, Senator Isham G. Harris (D-Tennessee) (the President pro tempore of the United States Senate) introduced a new condemnation bill similar to S.2637. A slightly different bill was offered in the House. The House bill officially required the city to extend North Capitol Street through cemetery land. Although Congress had revamped the eminent domain process the previous year, the House bill forced the city to use the old process for condemning the property. Half the funds to pay for the land were appropriated from the U.S. Treasury, with the other half coming from District of Columbia revenues. Construction costs were capped at $10,000. On October 17, the House District of Columbia Committee recommended approval of this bill. The House legislation received a favorable reception in the Senate, and the Senate District of Columbia Committee approved it on December 7. The bill passed both chambers by voice vote on December 21, 1893. With federal law no longer a bar to condemnation of cemetery land, the PHC announced it would cease to oppose the extension of North Capitol Street and allow a jury to determine an appropriate condemnation award. The contentious condemnation and the Constitutional ruling By mid-February 1894, the D.C. Supreme Court was close to naming a board of appraisers to determine the price of the Prospect Hill Cemetery land. PHC officials, however, were upset because the Panic of 1893 had depressed land values. Had Congress acted with more speed, the transaction would have been finalized years ago and the PHC would have received a better price. The board of appraisers issued their report on March 16, 1894. The appraisers valued the land at $45,724 and assessed damages of $5,962 to the cemetery's remaining land, for a total compensation award of $51,686 ($ in dollars). The price was more than 40 cents per square foot. Shocked at the high level of the award, the city appealed to the D.C. Supreme Court. But on June 24, 1894, the D.C. Supreme Court upheld the board of appraisers' award. The commissioners then appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. Work on North Capitol Street, then under way, ceased after reaching the border of the cemetery. The city commissioners immediately sought the help of Congress. They proposed passage of legislation setting aside the appraisers' award, and to seek condemnation under the new eminent domain procedure enacted as part of the 1891 D.C. highway act (approved August 30, 1890). This bill was introduced in the Senate, and reported favorably by the Senate District of Columbia Committee on July 1, 1894. The Senate Appropriations Committee attached the bill to the D.C. appropriations legislation for 1895. The amended appropriations bill passed the Senate, and went to a House–Senate conference committee. The conference committee agreed on August 2 to retain the Prospect Hill Cemetery amendment. The legislation passed Congress on August 7, 1894. The city filed a motion with the D.C. Supreme Court on August 13, asking that the appraisal be vacated. The court refused, declaring the Act of August 7, 1894, to be an unconstitutional interference in due process and the courts. The city appealed to the D.C. Court of Appeals. While the appeal was being heard, the city attempted to condemn a second piece of cemetery property. But the PHC sued to stop this condemnation proceeding, and on December 23, 1894, the D.C. Superior Court issued an injunction against the city which prevented any second condemnation until the appellate court ruled. The Court of Appeals consolidated both appeals. On March 4, 1895, in District of Columbia v. Prospect Hill Cemetery, 5 C.App.D.C. 497 (1895), the D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the D.C. Supreme Court in both cases, and upheld the D.C. Supreme Court's holding that the Act of August 7, 1894, was unconstitutional. It ordered the city to pay the full $51,686 if it proceeded with condemnation. At the annual meeting of the Prospect Hill Cemetery lotholders in March, the lotholders voted to cease their opposition to the extension of North Capitol Street and drop all existing appeals. The following month, however, the city commissioners again approached members of Congress to find a way to have the appraisal ruling overturned. More alarming to cemetery lotholders was a new city street map, which failed to show the cemetery and instead showed extensive subdivisions on the cemetery property. In May, the city went even further and published a street extension map showing an extension of Albany Street NW through the northern part of the burial ground. Resolution of the North Capitol Street controversy Retaining wall built along the North Capitol Street side of Prospect Hill Cemetery in 1917. Events came to a head on October 4, 1895, when the city commissioners ordered North Capitol Street opened. The order, however, made no mention of any payment to Prospect Hill Cemetery. On October 5, PHC legal counsel filed a motion in the D.C. Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus ordering the city commissioners to pay the required $51,686. The city commissioners replied that they were under no obligation to do so, as they had not sought the land and no injury or loss of possession had occurred at Prospect Hill Cemetery. This argument proved unpersuasive to the court, and the writ was issued. The city appealed to the D.C. Court of Appeals. On February 4, 1896, the Court of Appeals overturned the writ. The Court of Appeals agreed that the Act of December 21, 1893, clearly ordered the District of Columbia to open North Capitol Street. This command was not discretionary. The question was whether, and to what extent, the Act of August 7, 1895, repealed or altered this intent of Congress. The court was highly critical of the language of the Act of August 7. It was \\"most unwisely and improvidently drawn by some one who gave but little thought to it, and was undoubtedly passed without consideration; and in our former opinion, when its provisions were pressed upon our attention, we were compelled to disregard them\\". Even so, the court held, the Act of August 7, 1895, acted as a repeal of the Act of December 21, 1893. This left the method of condemnation specified in the second part of the Act of August 7 inconsistent and unenforceable. But with the requirement to open North Capitol Street now repealed, the commissioners were not obliged to take the land. The only way to interpret the Act of August 7, the court of appeals concluded, was to assume that Congress had withdrawn from the attempt at condemnation. No writ should issue, as the city commissioners had the right to refuse to take the land. The 54th United States Congress began on December 2, 1895. On February 28, 1896, Representative George M. Curtis (R-Iowa) introduced a bill in the House ordering the city to open North Capitol Street though the lands owned by Prospect Hill Cemetery and Mrs. Barbour. The bill was silent as to the means of condemnation, and provided an open-ended appropriation to pay for the property. Construction costs were capped at $10,000, and were to be paid jointly by the federal government and the city. In the Senate, Joseph Roswell Hawley (R-Connecticut) introduced legislation which was similar to the Curtis bill. However, the Hawley bill specifically appropriated $51,686 from the U.S. Treasury to pay for the Prospect Hill Cemetery land. The Senate District of Columbia Committee favorably reported bill the March 12. Although the city commissioners opposed the bill, arguing that it stripped the city of its procedures for securing eminent domain established in the Act of March 2, 1893. Representatives from PHC enthusiastically endorsed it. Senator McMillan, an initial supporter of the Hawley bill, now opposed it as too expensive. This doomed the Senate legislation. A companion to the Hawley bill, H.B.6788, was also opposed by the city commissioners. But on April 23, 1896, the D.C. Court of Appeals struck down the eminent domain assessment procedures established by the Act of March 2, 1893. With the city bereft of a process for eminent domain, the objection raised by the commissioners no longer applied. Senator Hawley re-introduced his bill (S. 2332) on May 3, 1896. Determined to win passage of the legislation, the PHC hired ex-Representative John J. Hemphill (who had instigated the 1888 House subcommittee investigation) to represent it before Congress. But despite Hemphill's efforts, the bill languished in the Senate, and no action was taken by December. Hemphill was far more effective in persuading his ex-colleagues in the House to act. On December 17, 1896, the House passed a companion bill (H.B. 6713) paying the PHC $51,686 for its land. H.B. 6713 headed for the Senate, where the Senate District of Columbia Committee favorably reported it on January 7. The Senate substituted H.B. 6713 for S. 2332, and on February 11, 1897—with just 20 days left in the 54th Congress—the legislation passed the Senate without discussion. Defeated, the city commissioners asked President Grover Cleveland to sign the bill. He signed it into law on February 20, 1897. This ended a 12-year legal battle over the future of Prospect Hill Cemetery. The cemetery's size was reduced by . A receiving vault was constructed at Prospect Hill Cemetery some time in the late 1800s. The first mention of the vault came in 1880. 20th century A chapel, designed by the D.C.-based architectural firm of Autenrieth and Goenner, was built at Prospect Hill Cemetery in the center of the circle bordering Lincoln Road NE in 1900. Opening W Street NW The resolution of the Prospect Hill Cemetery board of trustees, accepting $5,000 payment for its land for the W Street NW eastward extension. The District of Columbia successfully opened W Street NW through cemetery land in a far less divisive way in 1907. The effort to open the street began in January 1903, when the city decided to open W Street NW between 2nd Street NW and North Capitol Street. This would have effectively divided the cemetery's land west of North Capitol Street into equal north and south portions. Congress, however, provided no funds to obtain the land and the city would not initiate eminent domain proceedings. Instead, the city requested that the land be donated, which the cemetery declined to do. When the city next raised the issue, a year later, the city's legal counsel said the land must be condemned because the cemetery's charter did not allow it to alienate land. Subsequently, a bill was introduced in Congress in February 1904 to pay Prospect Hill Cemetery $5,000 for the necessary land. The city then asked to extend Albany Street NW (now Adams Street NW) eastward as well. The 58th United States Congress ended without action being taken on either issue. New legislation (S. 5119) was introduced in April 1906. This legislation limited W Street NW to just in width. The legislation permitted the city to seek condemnation of Prospect Hill Cemetery land in the courts, with the compensation award capped at $5,000. The legislation also stripped the D.C. and federal courts of jurisdiction over the case, barring any appeal by the cemetery or city. The bill passed the Senate on June 29. Congress, arguing that the street extension would significantly raise the property values of land in the immediate vicinity of W Street NW, taxed local landowners near the street to pay for the extension. These landowners, most of whom belonged to the North Washington Citizens' Association, were furious at what they perceived to be an excessively generous award (or, alternatively, an expensive tax to pay for the road). The citizens' association went on record denouncing the bill. Nonetheless, the bill passed the House on December 17, 1906. The land, however, was appraised at just $4,000. On May 1, 1907, the city moved forward with its condemnation and construction of the street. Minor changes Looking east at Section D-North. In December 1907, the District of Columbia placed a property assessment on landowners along North Capitol Street to pay for the installation of sidewalks. Prospect Hill Cemetery officials resisted paying the assessment, arguing that federal law specifically exempted their land from taxation. The outcome of the dispute is not known. The extension of North Capitol Street led to significant changes at Prospect Hill Cemetery. A new retaining wall topped by a wrought iron fence and new main gate were constructed on North Capitol Street. Several sets of remains had to be reinterred to accommodate the new construction. Changes in the 1910s to Lincoln Road NE required the construction of a new wall and fence on the east side of the cemetery. Most of the original walls were torn down around 1917, and a new wall constructed. Portions of the wall consisted of ashlar granite blocks of various shades and colors, both coursed and randomly set. Other portions consisted of rusticated or rubble rock of various types (such as granite, greenschist, mica-schist, and other rock). The walls were topped with wrought iron fencing and cast iron finials. Prospect Hill Cemetery constructed a new gatehouse at North Capitol Street and W Street NW in 1927. The square structure with fieldstone walls was two stories high. It had an attic and a hip roof, with a hip-roof dormer on the north and south sides. As the Great Depression took hold, fewer changes were made at Prospect Hill Cemetery. With the cemetery not enclosed along V Street NW, the North Capitol Citizens' Association pressed for the cemetery to finish the wall and fence. They were successful, and in April 1933 cemetery officials hired the V.F. Duckett firm to design a $2,000 concrete and brick wall for its south border.; But with economic conditions worsening, the cemetery put off the work until 1939. Sale of the western cemetery land The extension of North Capitol Street left of the cemetery on the west side of the street, while the remaining (where all the burials were) was to the east. Lots sales were almost nonexistent in the west portion of the cemetery, as individuals did not want to feel cut off from the cemetery. PHC resolved to sell off the eastern , and in April 1920 legislation was introduced in Congress to permit the sale. This legislation died when the 66th United States Congress ended on March 3, 1921. New legislation was introduced in the 67th United States Congress, and was enacted into law by Congress on January 21, 1922.; ; The western five acres were sold off later in 1922. Two major events happened at Prospect Hill Cemetery in 1929. The cemetery—which by now was advertising its nonsectarian nature—opened up two new sections in February, expanding the area for burials. In April, the government of the District of Columbia and Concordia Church both observed the 100th anniversary of the birth of attorney and newspaper publisher Louis F. Schade, who was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in 1903.; Mid to late 20th century Map of Prospect Hill Cemetery as of 2014. Hard- hit by the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination riots of 1968, Washington, D.C.—and particularly the neighborhoods around Prospect Hill Cemetery—rapidly declined in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Daniel King, superintendent of the cemetery since 1925, and his family left the superintendent's residence in 1972 after numerous break-ins. Turnover in the superintendent position was heavy during the next 12 years. Financially strapped due to lack of lot sales and lacking an endowment, Prospect Hill Cemetery entered into a management agreement with adjacent Glenwood Cemetery in 1985. The agreement proved unsatisfactory: A Glenwood employee rented out the Prospect Hill maintenance shed for use as a business, a portion of Prospect Hill was used for trash disposal without PHC permission, the grounds were ill-maintained, building repairs were not made, and PHC was overcharged for leaf removal. PHC officials rented out a portion of the cemetery to the District of Columbia Public Schools for a school bus parking lot, and a proposal was made to utilize part of the grounds as a pet cemetery. When Glenwood Cemetery said in 1992 that it would not renew the contract without a substantial fee increase, the Prospect Hill Cemetery board of directors voted to end the management agreement. With the advice of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, which had helped save and revive Congressional Cemetery in the 1980s, Prospect Hill slowly recovered. The gatehouse (now called the Stone House) was renovated and made livable again, finances improved, and groundskeeping equipment was purchased. The German-American Heritage Society placed a memorial plaque at the site of the former chapel in 1997, and a local garden club created and began maintaining a garden around it. 21st century One fund-raising scheme bore fruit, however. In 2006, Prospect Hill Cemetery rented out a small portion of its maintenance yard for the erection of a cell phone tower. In 2007, lotholders planted a Memorial Garden to beautify the grounds. The Memorial Garden was transplanted in 2009 to form the basis of a new Memorial Grove. The Memorial Grove was planted against the northern boundary of the burial grounds to help conceal Prospect Hill's and Glenwood Cemetery's maintenance yards. The Memorial Grove was a gift from District 1 of the National Capital Area Garden Clubs, and was completed in September 2009. During preparation of the ground, Prospect Hill Cemetery discovered that the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) had installed a water line through the northern part of the cemetery in 1896. Although the cemetery provided DCWASA with an easement for the water line, these records were lost. The line was located and marked. A sculpted stone angel, which years ago had fallen from a century-old grave, was installed on a foundation in the center of the grove. Prospect Hill began a years-long effort to repair roadways and paved walkways throughout the cemetery in 2010. Lanham Construction Co. began a $1,600 repair effort on the sidewalk between the gatehouse and the maintenance shed and on the sidewalk adjacent to the gatehouse in Fall 2010. Sidewalks and steps in Section E of the cemetery followed in 2012. The cemetery made two major repairs in 2011. Advisory Neighborhood Commission 5C met with cemetery officials to discuss the deteriorating fence along the alley south of Bryant Street NE. The fence was overgrown, and damaged in places where local people had attempted to dump trash and large objects over the fence. Although the damage was not the fault of Prospect Hill, the cemetery agreed to repair the fence at a cost of $5,500. Repairs included removing vegetation, repairing the wall and fence, extending the wall and fence a short distance, and reinforcing the fence posts with angle braces. The second major repair effort involved the Stone House. The 2011 Virginia earthquake struck the city on August 23, 2011, followed by Hurricane Irene on August 26–28. Some tombstones were toppled by the earthquake, and some trees fell over during the storm (damaging the stone angel in the Memorial Grove), but surprisingly little other damage occurred. Major leaks in the Stone House occurred during the hurricane, however, and a post-storm investigation revealed that the clay tile roof needed major repair. Further investigation showed that the leaks had rotted eaves and roof joists. The project, expected to cost $75,000, was completed on November 7, 2011, at a total cost of $129,500. The Memorial Grove angel, whose wing and head were broken off during the hurricane, was repaired in the summer of 2013 and reset on its foundation. About the cemetery Looking at Chapel Circle on the east side of the cemetery. Prospect Hill remains an active burial ground. Hundreds of burials plots remained for sale in late 2010. The cemetery retains its character as a garden cemetery, including its asymmetrical, winding pathways and roads; landscaping; and walls. Burials occur in plots and in rows, and many graves are marked with good examples of Victorian funerary art. Many markers from the mid to late 1800s markers are simple slabs or headstones carved from limestone or marble, which is typical for the mid-Atlantic area in the 1800s. Later monuments tend to be larger and more ornate, and several prominent sculptors are known to have created pieces for the cemetery. Included among them are works by noted German-American artist Jacques Jouvenal. About 75 percent of the 14,000 burials at Prospect Hill Cemetery in 2006 are German Americans, and the cemetery remains the historic burying ground of the city's once-large German American community. Most of the remaining graves represent European families. Almost 200 Civil War veterans, most of them German Americans who served in the 8th Battalion, are buried at Prospect Hill. The cemetery began converting its burial records to electronic format in late 2012. The first information to be digitized were lot ownership records, with burial records to follow. The cemetery's western, northern, and eastern walls and iron fences date to about 1917, while the southern wall and fence date to 1939. The walls are of varying height, color, and construction. The barn, farmhouse, 1873 gatehouse, and chapel were all demolished in the 20th century. The date of the chapel's demolition is unclear but it was in use for both funerals and other public services (such as Memorial Day worship) until 1950. The late 1800s receiving vault was also demolished in the 20th century. It remained in use at least until 1945. The 1927 gatehouse remains, however, and has retained its historic integrity. Prospect Hill Cemetery was added to District of Columbia register of historic places in 2005. Notable interments Grave of August Schoenborn Grave of Louis F.

Today, the vast majority of Romanians wear modern style dress on most occasions, and the garments described here largely fell out of use during the 20th century. However, they can still be seen in more remote areas, on special occasions, and at ethnographic and folk events. Each historical region has its own specific variety of costume. Ethnographic regions Romanian traditional clothing can be classified according to seven traditional regions. These can be further subdivided by ethnographic zones, which may range between 40 and 120, depending on the criteria used. The seven main regions are: * Transylvania or Ardeal * The western plains: Lower Mureș Plain, Criș Plain (Crișul Negru, Crișul Alb, Crișul Repede), Lower Someș Plain (Oaș Country) * Banat, including Timiș Meadow and Caraș-Severin * Wallachia, including Oltenia and Muntenia * The Lower Danube, including Bărăgan, Dobruja and southern Moldavia * Moldavia, including Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transnistria * Balkans or Romanians of the Balkan Peninsula, which can be further subdivided into four areas: ** The Daco-Romanians along the borders: Cadrilater (Bulgaria), the Timok Valley (northwestern Bulgaria and eastern Serbia), Vojvodina/Serbian Banat and Ukraine (especially around Chernivtsi and Odessa) ** Istro-Romanians in Istria, Croatia ** Macedo-Romanians (or Aromanians) in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and North Macedonia ** Megleno-Romanians in Greece and North Macedonia File:Chiuiesti,Cluj-DSCF1172.JPGTransylvania File:Port oșenesc.jpegOaș Country File:Women in traditional dress of the Mehadia region.jpgBanat File:Gheorghe Tattarescu - Taranca din Vlasca.jpgWallachia File:2 Moldova.jpgMoldavia File:Bucovina.jpgBukovina File:Outfits of Maramures Aprons VP8.webmMaramureș Genesis and evolution of Romanian traditional costume=First mentions about Romanian clothing Dacian women wearing ștergar, similar to the contemporary headkerchief. Dacian and Romanian peasant dress comparison Given the weight (900-1,100 g) and size, the handmade gold bracelets were most likely worn by Dacian men, members of the upper class. The Romanian popular costume finds its roots in the part of Thracian, Dacian and Getae ancestors and resembles with that of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula, of course with differences consisting of decorative and colorful details. Between 7000 and 3500 BC was founded the belief in the one controlling power of the cosmos. Fabrics wore symbols appointed by virtue of faith, thus spinning and weaving became sacred. Therefore, were customary on the dresses the solar circle, the column of the sky, the rhomb, the hatch or the curved lines. Since 3500 BC and until year zero has passed from the sacred weaving to the vestment, the ritual reaching from the imposing space of the temple to the household hearth. The purpose of the garments worn by the ancestors was to facilitate dialogue with the unseen forces of the cosmos.Maria Bâtcă, Costumul popular românesc, vol. II of Anotimpul de artă populară collection groomed by Oana Gabriela Petrică and edited by CNCPCT, Bucharest, 2006 Thus, it is still possible to talk about a civilization of sacred fabrics. For example, the thread of spun is column-shaped and spirally twisted, which increases the sacredness of the fabric. Also, having different colors is the most useful means for expressing feelings and behaviors. Popular clothes Carpatho-Danubian territory summarizes existential and spiritual dimension of Romanians, but component parts of clothes multiplied and the clothing became a costume.Virgil Vasilescu, Semnele cerului. Cultură și civilizație carpatică, Archetype-Spiritual Renaissance Publishing House, Bucharest, 1994 As a result, the autochthonous popular garment is a system of which developed the regional variations, through innovations and contaminations caused by each creator against the prototype schema. The form and ornametics of the contemporary garments preserved a part of the language of signs and symbols specific to the mythical thinking of those times. Thus, the first testimonies about Romanian traditional port are set in stone, on Tropaeum Traiani monument in Adamclisi and Trajan's Column in Rome. For example, women portraits carved on Trajan's Column after the Dacian wars provide information about their clothing. Dacian women wore shirts rippled at the neck related to the Romanian ie. Sleeves were either long and wide or short. The dress was long to the ground, over which sometimes was attached a wide draped mantle. In the feet they wore leather sandals in summer and fur sandals in winter.Maria Gimbutas, Civilizație și cultură, Meridians Publishing House, Bucharest, 1989, p. 49 Middle Ages and Byzantine influence Costume of a typical Romanian shepherd, 18th century Wallachian peasantry and troops, 1853 Painting by Stephen Catterson Smith depicting three peasants from Hodod, Transylvania A Romanian girl wearing an elaborately decorated vest. Painting by Marianne Stokes Portraits of the founders provide important information about the type of material of which were made the pieces of the port and about elements of tailoring, decor and chromatics. Between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, votive paintings on the walls of churches reserved to country's rulers and nobility hypostasiate a wider range of donors. As a result, in the sub-Carpathian areas of Oltenia (especially in Gorj) appear portraits of free peasants, freeholders and yeomen. But representations of peasant port date from the fourteenth century. In Codex Latinus Parisinus, written during 1395–1396 by Paulus Sanctinus Ducensis, military engineer of King Sigismund of Luxembourg, besides portraits of knights and footmen appear described ancillaries of the army: craftsmen, cartmen, fishermen. In Chronicon Pictum Vindobonense are portrayed men in white shirts and trousers (). Over they wore shaggy sarici with long sleeves and left on back. They wore simple leather shoes (). In a simple comparative analysis it can be grasped that these elements are always present in the port of remote shepherds. Diaries of foreign travelers, particularly those of Antonio Maria Del Chiaro Fiorentino (secretary of Italian language of Constantin Brâncoveanu) and officer Friedrich Schwanz von Springfels contain rich information about the garments of Romanians: ladies, patronesses and peasant women wore identically tailored shirts, distinct being only the methods used for decoration. Boyar shirts were of silk, embroidered with gold thread and decorated with pearls. The costume of Oltenia peasant women was composed of cotton shirts sewn with altițe, striped catrințe and bete. Like them, patronesses wore on head long headkerchief () of floss silk or flax, that hung on back.Thomas Carlyle, Filozofia vestimentației, second edition, European Institute, Bucharest, 1998, p. 79 In the medieval period was shaped the aesthetic vision of clothing assemblies worn by Romanians. Socio-economic conditions of the feudal period and administrative-territorial units that made up the so-called \\"countries\\" gave rise to specific types of costumes with local specificity for the Romanian lands. But regional variations should be reported to the prototype that has formed the basis, which shows the unity and diversity of Romanian popular costumes. The climax of the artistic value of traditional costumes was reached in the mid-nineteenth century, when ennobled the Romanians bodies throughout the country. In the context of building the national conscience were sedimented the key-insignia of Romanian port, that distinguish it from surrounding ethnic groups. The present situation After World War I, the popular clothing generalized across traditional communities remain just in the everyday life of older generation, becoming a ceremonial vestment. In rural penetrated some albums with \\"national motifs\\" edited by traders of textile fibers and dyes industries. During the communist period, these mutations decreased the creative process of costumes in the households. Nowadays, the main wearers of peasant garb are the soloists of folk music, the folk dance ensembles and the actors in movies and shows. Men's clothing Peasants from Abrud. Painting by Ion Theodorescu-Sion Ițari The ițari are typical for Moldovans and represent a pair of long peasant trousers that were sewn from țigaie (a special breed of sheep wool) and had a length of 2 m, but being narrow, they were crimped on the leg from ankle to the knee. They were worn during the summer and the winter. Ițarii for summer wear are made of pânză de sac (bulky cotton). Cioareci The cioareci are peasant pants of white woollen cloth (dimie, pănură or aba) woven in four threads, therefore thicker than the ițari. In Banat, the cioareci are known as canvas or baize stockings worn by women during the winter. In Moldavia can be found cioareci without creți that are worn in the working days. Here, they are also known as bernevici. In the South and Moldavia, trousers are worn over boots or shoes whereas in Transylvania they are tucked into the tops of the boots. The amount and style of decoration on cioareci depends on regional style. The majority of the decoration is on the upper parts of the trousers around the pockets, and front. Trousers worn with boots did not have any decoration on the lower part whereas those worn with spats had decoration down the legs accenting the cut of the trousers and round the hems or turn-ups. Opinci The oldest type of footwear is peasant sandals (opinci) worn with hemp canvas, woollen or felt foot wraps (obiele) or woollen socks (călțuni). Evidence for this style of footwear can be seen on a clay foot found in Turdaș, dating from around 2500 BC. Opinci were worn throughout Romania and over a wide area of south and east Europe being known as opanke (Serbia), tservuli (Bulgaria), opinci (North Macedonia), etc. Opinci are made of a single rectangle of cow, ox or pig hide gathered round the foot in various ways. Pieptar Known often by various names locally, the pieptar is an embroidered sheepskin vest, made generally in two styles, opened (spintecat) or close (înfundat), with the first being of normal front cut and the second one having a side open to be closed with buttons or taken over the head like a pullover. They were usually made from sheepskin, with the sheared or non sheared fur worn inside for warmth and the embroidered part outwards. Cămaşa Camasa is literally the Romanian word for shirt, and the variety of cuts and styles is overwhelming, varying greatly not only by area but also by age, status and occupation, only to be surpassed in variety by the women ones. Traditionally they were made of hemp or linseed linen, later of cotton. Suman The suman is a long peasant coat, a cold weather garment, worn by both sexes, usually knee-deep, in white, cream, brown, gray or black woolen cloth (felt), decorated with warious decorated with găitane. It is also known as țundră, zeghe or dulamă. They were normally tailored rough at home by the poor or by special suman makers from strips of shrunk woven boiled wool cloth, processed in water powered fulling-mills known as \\"vâltoare\\". Sumans vary in thickness greatly from region to region, from a few millimeters finely woven material in the south (Oltenia and Dobrudja), to a very rough two centimeters in north (Maramures). Chimir and brâu  Of great importance was the girdle, their thick belt made of leather in case of chimir or woven textile in case of brau. HatsSheepskin hats= A variety of fur hats, Museum of the Romanian Peasant, Bucharest Căciulă are worn all over Romania and in most of the surrounding Balkan countries in winter. Fur hats are made by furriers and are most often black, although white căciulă are worn in parts of Banat and grey in central and north Moldavia. There are four types of căciulă found in Romania: * High conical cap – căciulă țuguiată, moțată, cujmă – this is made of four pieces joined together lengthwise. It can be worn peaked, with top bent forward, back or sideways, or with top sunk inwards, depending on local fashion. It is worn in Moldavia, Muntenia, Maramures, Oltenia and Banat, originally by the \\"free men\\".Stoica, V. and Vagii, M. (1969), Arta populară din Câmpia Munteniei, Casa Creației, Ilfov In Banat Mountains, the cap is sometimes worn with fur inside and a narrow white fur hem at base. * Round low cap known as cujmă rotilată in Maramureș, consisting of two parts: a long band forming a cylinder and a round top sewn to the upper edge of the cylinder. * Caps made of a single piece of fur are also found in Maramureș and Oaș. These are made by stretching the raw fur on a spherical wooden shaped block which makes it take the shape of the head. This simple \\"skull\\" cap was formally worn by serfs. * Căciulă joasă – cylindrical fur cap with the top larger than the base. This is called mocănească, rotată, retezată or turtită and is worn by shepherds on both sides of the southern Carpathians (in Mărginimea Sibiului, Oltenia, Muntenia and Vrancea) and also in Bărăgan Plain and Dobruja due to this area being used for summer pastures by the Carpathian shepherds, and also in Maramureș. =Felt hats= Hard felt hats are made by specialised craftsmen in workshops and are worn throughout the year. These hats are found centred on the Saxon regions around Sibiu and Bistrița and may have been introduced into Transylvania by the Saxons, whose craftsmen made them in workshops, from the 18th century. The style varies widely in shape and size of brim according to area. The wide brimmed hat appeared around the 17th-19th centuries and felt hats with broad brims up to 60 cm were worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and continued to be worn in Bistrița Valley, Moldavia until the 1940s. Hats with 40 cm brims were worn in central Transylvania and Muntenia. Felt hats with hard upturned brims – cu găng – were worn in Crișana, Hunedoara and Bukovina following a fashion of the gentry.Florescu, F. B. (1957), Portul popular din Moldova de Nord, Arta Publishing House Wide brimmed felt hats with a large peacock feather (roată de păun) are still worn in Năsăud, further south the hats are much reduced in size, shepherds in Sibiu and along the southern Carpathians wear felt hats with very small brims, the present day fashion tending to do away with the brim altogether. Green \\"trilby\\"-style hats worn by Romanian border guards and mountain corps are still found in Pădureni and other areas today. This style originated in the Austrian Tyrol, and reached Romania during Habsburg rule, and became international due to the Habsburg's preference for wearing Tyrolese costume for hunting throughout their Empire. This style is now widespread for everyday use.Bielz, I. (1956), Portul popular al sașilor din Transilvania, Arta Publishing House =Straw hats= Clop ornated with peacock feathers Straw hats are worn by men (and women) throughout Romania in the summer. Straw hats vary in style from region to region although regional differences are now becoming less common as the straw version of the trilby takes over.Horșia, O. and Petrescu, P. (1971), Artistic Handicrafts in Romania, UCECOM In Maramureș, traditional straw hats (clop, pl. clopuri) are very small, while in Satu Mare, Arad, Transylvanian Plain hats have a high crown. The tallest – around 30 cm – can be found in Codru. In Oltenia and Teleroman, along the Danube, flat brimmed straw hats with rounded crown are worn. In Maramureș and Oaș Country, men also often wear their clopuri in the winter.Bănățeanu, T. (1955), Portul popular din Țara Oașului, Arta Publishing House Women's clothing Elisabeth of Wied, Queen of Romania, in a complete national costume Ie Ie is the type of shirt of a typical gathered form of the collar, which has existed since ancient times. It is also known as the \\"Carpathian shirt\\", similar to the Slavic (Bulgarian, Serbian, Ukrainian, etc.) peoples. The three-part decor code of this pleated shirt is almost always the same: in addition to the underarm embroidery, the altiță (derived from Serbian ла̏тица), there is a single horizontal row on the sleeve, known as increț, and diagonal stripes below the armpit and shoulder, the râuri. The underarm embroidery characterizes the entire costume; it is traditionally seen as the culmination of embroidery and decoration. Each blouse tells a compelling story about the region it comes from through the symbols and colors used. Fotă The fotă is a richly ornamented wrap-around skirt made out of a rectangular piece of woolen fabric worn at the waist. Alternately, it can be made of two pieces of woven material that cover the front of the body (like an apron) and the back.DEX The fotă has several names, according to the ethnographic region: pestelcă (in Muntenia), opreg, vălnic and zăvelcă (in Oltenia), catrință or cretință (in Moldavia), păstură and zadie (in Transylvania), peștiman (in Bessarabia). The fotă is made of woollen material or cotton mixed with wool, woven on four heddles. It fully covers the underskirt (poale) except for, in some areas, the hem. The oldest fote were made of black or greyish brown fabric using the natural colours of the wool. The earliest decoration was a red border (bete roșii) at the lower edge and on the front edge, which strengthen the fabric. This type of fotă is still found in north Moldavia where fote made of hemp or flax were formerly worn in some parts in summer. Fote with vertical stripes (vâstre) are also common in this area. The extent of the decoration becomes more elaborate as one moves south. The stripes change from simple woven decoration to alternately simple stripes and stripes of woven motifs (alesăture). In Muntenia, the stripes are replaced by compact woven decoration or heavy geometric embroidery, covering the whole surface except for the area which is overlapped in the front. The richest decoration is found in Argeș and Muscel zones where the fotă itself is occasionally made from silk, and the woven decoration is in gold or silver thread.Florescu, F. B., Stahl, P. and Petrescu, P. (1967), Arta populară din zonele Argeș și Muscel, Academy Press A Romanian girl with maramă on the head. Painting by Nicolae Grigorescu Maramă Among the elements that should not miss in women's clothing are the \\"head coverings\\". They have a great aesthetic and social value for women. Young girls accustom to walk bareheaded, but after the wedding ritual – \\"bride's binders\\", \\"bride undressing\\" – the godmother puts her a beautiful basma or maramă. The maramă is worn mainly in southern Romania, southern Moldavia and southern Transylvania. Marame possibly have an oriental origin and are decorated with white patterns woven onto a white background and often grouped toward the ends. In Argeș, the patterns can include coloured geometric motifs.Petrescu, P., Secosan, E. and Doaga, A.

Almost all ships of both designs were renamed for United States presidents by May 1921, with Golden State being renamed President Cleveland. As one of the USSB-owned ships operated by agents of the board, President Cleveland was allocated to and operated by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company until sold by the USSB to the Dollar Steamship Line in 1925. After the demise of that line and creation of a new, replacement line, American President Lines, the ship remained with that line until government acquisition for the Second World War. President Cleveland was acquired by the War Department and renamed Tasker H. Bliss and converted into a troop transport which served in the Pacific immediately preceding and after outbreak of the war. She was acquired from the United States Army by the United States Navy for war use, commissioned USS Tasker H. Bliss on 15 September 1942, and designated as transport AP-42. On 12 November 1942, while supporting Operation Torch of the North African campaign she was sunk after being struck by a German submarine’s torpedo at Fedala Bay, Morocco. One of the few survivors of the U.S.S. Bliss is Wesley Charnesky of Salem, Ohio. His wife, Amelia (aka Sis) also served during this time in the WACS. Construction Golden State, one of the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) Design 1029 ships, often called in the trade \\"535s\\" for their length overall, planned as a troop transport, but redesigned and built as a passenger and cargo ship, with yard hull number 256, was launched 17 July 1920 in Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company and completed in 1921 assigned United States official number 220485. Commercial service Golden State was originally owned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB), allocated to and operated by its agents. The ship was renamed President Cleveland by May 1921 and was eventually owned and operated as a passenger liner by the American President Lines. The USSB first placed the ship in service with Pacific Mail Steamship Company for service between San Francisco and Asia with the ship arriving 7 March 1921, second after sister ship Hawkeye State operated by Matson Navigation Company arrived on 5 March in what some described as a race from Baltimore, but the company noted was not as Golden State made several more port calls on the voyage. By December 1923, the ship, now President Cleveland, was operating with sailings every 14 days from San Francisco to Honolulu, Japan, China, and the Philippines in a route dubbed \\"The Sunshine Belt to the Orient\\" with President Lincoln, President Pierce, President Taft, and President Wilson. As late as May 1925, the ships were seen as USSB vessels of the California Orient Line operated by Pacific Mail Steamship Company, but the next month those vessels were seen in an advertisement headed \\"Now serving the transpacific and round-the-world fleets of Dollar Steamship Line. Robert Stanley Dollar, son of the founder Captain Robert Dollar, had already acquired a fleet of the smaller Design 1095 ships, commonly known in the trade as \\"502s\\" or less frequently as \\"522s\\" for their length between perpendiculars and overall, respectively, and established a successful service circling the globe with 22 port calls when the government approached the company about purchase of the larger \\"535s\\". President Cleveland and the other former USSB ships of Pacific Mail's fleet continued to operate in this service until 1938 when the United States Maritime Commission, successor to the USSB, judged the Dollar company unsound and took over the assets including the ships to be operated by a new company, American President Lines. The seven \\"502s\\" were to remain on the Round the World service while the five \\"535s\\" along with larger and newer ship were to go into New York-San Francisco-Asiatic service for American President Lines. One of the ship's most famous passengers was the Nobel Prize–winning author Sigrid Undset, who fled the Nazis by travelling across Russia and sailed to the USA on the President Cleveland.Montreal Gazette Aug 27, 1940, p. 11 World War II service=U.S. Army The American President liner President Cleveland was chartered by the U.S. Army in July 1941 and renamed USAT Tasker H. Bliss for General Tasker H. Bliss, who was Army Chief of Staff in 1917 to 1918. The ship was quickly converted at San Francisco into a troop transport and made an initial voyage to Alaska by way of Seattle. After returning to San Francisco in August, Bliss made quick turn around for a voyage to Manila by way of Honolulu and Guam, returning in September 1941. In October 1941, Bliss made another round trip to Manila, and after voyage repairs and additional alterations at San Francisco, made a round trip to Hawaii. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, reinforcement of Hawaii was extremely urgent and shipments were hurriedly organized. A convoy composed of , , and left San Francisco on 16 December 1941 transporting troops, ammunition, and pursuit aircraft with Bliss and departing on 17 December with troops, aircraft, and supplies. A voyage to Australia and the ports of Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney followed before Bliss returned to San Francisco in April 1942 to make another round trip to Hawaii before sailing again for Australia and New Zealand. From there, Bliss departed in June 1942 for Baltimore by way of the Panama Canal, Guantanamo, Key West, and Hampton Roads. U.S. Navy The ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy on 19 August 1942 at Baltimore, where she was converted for use as a Navy transport by the Maryland Drydock Co., Baltimore, Maryland, and commissioned with Commander Gerald L. Schetky in command on 15 September 1942 as USS Tasker H. Bliss designated as transport AP-42. Tasker H. Bliss arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 September and joined Task Force 34 (TF 34). After loading troops and equipment to participate in Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, the ships of the task force sailed on 24–25 October for the coast of Morocco. The ship was assigned to Task Group 34.9 (TG 34.9), Center Attack Group, and arrived off Fedhala, Morocco on 8 November. During the landings, Bliss had to re-embark the 3d Reconnaissance Troop of 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment after a failed night attack to destroy a heavy antiaircraft gun battery at Beach Yellow, on Cap de Fedala southwest of the town of Fedhala. The Naval Battle of Casablanca delayed off-loading cargo, and postponed departure from the Moroccan coast. On the evening of 12 November 1942, she was riding at anchor in Fedhala Roads when the Kriegsmarine submarine commanded by Ernst Kals slipped in among the ships and fired five torpedoes at three transports. All torpedoes hit their targets, and they burst into flames. The victims were transports , , and Tasker H. Bliss. All were abandoned and the first two sank shortly, but Tasker H. Bliss burned until 02:30 the next morning and then sank. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 December. Tasker H. Bliss received one battle star for World War II service.

It is used by homeopaths in an attempt to treat a range of symptoms that include digestive disorders and, as an application of the Law of Similars, has been suggested by homeopathy as a treatment for arsenic poisoning. Since the arsenic oxide in a homeopathic preparation is normally non-existent, it is considered generally safe, although cases of arsenic poisoning from poorly prepared homeopathic treatments sold in India have been reported. When properly prepared, however, the extreme dilutions, typically to at least 1 in 1024, or 12C in homeopathic notation, mean that a pill would not contain even a molecule of the original arsenic used. While Anisur Khuda-Bukhsh's unblinded studies have claimed an effect on reducing arsenic toxicity, they do not recommend its large-scale use, and studies of homeopathic remedies have been shown to generally have problems that prevent them from being considered unambiguous evidence.\\"The evidence of bias weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high- quality trials (e.g. [14,15]) have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most “original” subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results. It seems, therefore, likely that our meta- analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.\\" . There is no known mechanism for how arsenicum album could remove arsenic from a body, and there is insufficient evidence for it to be considered effective medicine (for any condition) by the scientific community. Use in homeopathy Arsenicum album is one of the fifteen most important remedies in homeopathy. In classical homeopathy, people are sometimes assigned a constitutional type, named after the homeopathic remedy applied, partly on the idea that people with similar physical or mental characteristics who suffer from similar symptoms can be treated effectively with their constitutional remedy. \\"Arsen. alb.\\" types are \\"tense, restless ambitious individuals\\" with a tendency toward hypochondriasis, pessimism, need for reassurance, and a meticulous attention to neatness and detail. For homeopathic use, arsenicum album is prepared by separating arsenic from iron (as in arsenopyrite), cobalt, or nickel by baking at high temperatures. The powder is then ground and diluted with lactose. In the final dilution, statistically most pills will contain zero molecules of the original arsenic used; some might contain a single molecule. The final product is sold as tinctures (liquid), tablets, pellets, or powder. Key homeopathic uses include attempting to treat anxiety and \\"fear caused by insecurity\\", digestive disorders and mucosal inflammation, and ailments characterized symptomatically by burning pain. It was also used once for treatment of syphilis. Research studies Several studies have been done into Arsenicum album; however, homeopathic studies are known to have problems, such as evidence of bias, lack of rigour, and failure to blind the experimenters or subjects to which group is being analyzed that prevent them from being considered definitive evidence for any effect. In addition, the ideas behind homeopathy are scientifically implausible and directly opposed to fundamental principles of natural science and modern medicine, which means that poorly conducted, small, or unblinded studies are not considered scientific proof of efficacy. The authors of one unblinded study of mice poisoned with arsenic and then given Arsenicum album, led by Anisur Khuda-Bukhsh, claimed statistically significant reductions were reported in biochemical markers of liver damage. However, other scientists remain doubtful: Andreas Gescher, a biochemical toxicologist interviewed by New Scientist, said \\"This kind of study uses a dilution so high there is hardly anything there... Is it really possible?\\" and went on to say that he was \\"extremely sceptical\\".

The site is about 7 miles from Logan, West Virginia. Biography Born Mamie Morrison, in Kentucky September 12, 1900 to George A. Morrison and an unknown mother (who died when Mamie was 3 years old). In 1924 Mamie and her husband, Jack Thurman moved from Bradfordsville, Kentucky to Logan County, West Virginia, where Jack was hired as a patrolman with the local police department. Jack and Mamie rented a small two-room apartment over a garage, located in the backyard of Harry and Louise Robertson's home. Robertson worked for the National Bank of Logan, and served as treasurer of the Logan Public Library. Jack worked nights, and was under the impression his wife did not venture out after dark, this was not the case. Despite the fact that the 31 year old Mamie was known as a good wife, a saintly woman, and a faithful church worker at Nighbert Memorial Church, she also frequented the local clubs and speakeasies, where she was known for her popularity and friendly disposition. Mrs. Thurman was also allegedly having an ongoing relationship with Harry Robertson and more than a dozen other powerful men in the county. Death and trial According to medical authorities at the time, Mamie Thurman's death resulted from her throat being slashed from ear to ear, after which she was shot twice in the left side of the head. The body was found in a patch of blackberries by a local boy, who then called the authorities. Found alongside the body were one shoe, a diamond engagement ring, and a silver wedding band, which ruled out robbery as the motive for her death. The other shoe and her purse, which contained $9 in change, cigarettes, and a wristwatch, were found 30 feet away the next day. Morticians would later uncover bloody rags and a razor in the home of her landlord Harry Robertson (the same house co-defendant Charles Stephenson lived in as the Robertsons' handyman). The manner and brutality of her murder was a shock to the citizens of the small, quiet towns in southern West Virginia. The arrest and eventual conviction of a handyman raised many questions in Logan, as the investigation involved several prominent citizens. The trial was standing room only, and many spectators brought their own chairs and basket lunches to court. Conspiracy Mamie Thurman's death certificate filed at the courthouse states she was buried at Logan Memorial Park in McConnell, West Virginia. Other records show that her body was transported to Bradfordsville, Kentucky. It remains a mystery to this day just where Mamie Thurman was buried and if the man convicted in her death was actually her murderer. Theatrical production In mid-2014, a play explaining the life, death, and trial regarding Mamie Thurman was in the works. The writer, Joyce Robertson, who was able to read through all the court documents in the case, finished the script in 2014. The play, Mamie, focuses on the last few months of Mamie's life, especially centered around her time of death. Auditions were held on March 26, 27, and 29, 2015 in Logan High School's Little Theater. The original production ran from June 19 to July 3, 2015. It was written for a cast involving more than 40 people; the first showing was held at the Liz Spurlock Amphitheater in the historic Chief Logan State Park in Logan, West Virginia. \\"Mamie\\" was produced by The Aracoma Story, Inc., again in the fall of 2019 in Logan, West Virginia, in the historic Coalfield Jamboree Theater.

Digital duplicators can provide a reliable and cost efficient alternative to toner- based copiers or offset printing equipment. The digital duplicator begins by digitally scanning the original and then transferring it to a master template through a thermal imaging process. Then the master is automatically wrapped around a print cylinder, where the ink is drawn through the perforations in the master creating the print. Digital duplicators are known for their high speed in comparison to other printing methods. They are able to produce anywhere from 45 to 180 prints per minute, while maintaining a per page cost that can be as low as 1/3 of a cent. They are also considered very reliable because they do not use heat or copier components, such as toner.
