He held the chair in Botany at The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and lectured at the University of Liverpool and Downing College, Cambridge. In 1895 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Early life Joseph Reynolds Green was the son of Daniel Green and was born on 3 December 1848 in Stowmarket, Suffolk. He attended a private school in Huntingdonshire,Aumni Cantabrigiensis and, during a period when his father moved to Bedford, Bedford Modern School.The Eagle Vol. III (1888), p. 243The Eagle Volume XXVII no, 2 (1949), p. 135 He appears to have had little scientific teaching in his early years. In the 1880s the botanist William Hillhouse recalled that, because of the absence of formal scientific teaching at Bedford Modern during his schooldays, he and two other former pupils of the school, Joseph Green and the mathematician and botanist Edward Mann Langley, had been compelled to rent a room in Peel Street in the town in order to undertake experiments in Chemistry, and claimed that their initiative had contributed to all three of them ultimately obtaining scholarships at Trinity College, Cambridge.The Eagle Vol. III (1888), p. 243 In addition, all three received informal tuition from Dr Samuel Hoppus Adams, a notable local physician and natural historian.Obituary of Joseph Reynolds Green, Bedfordshire Times 12 June 1914, p. 7Obituary of Samuel Hoppus Adams, Bedfordshire Times March, 9th, 1895, p. 7 Before Cambridge, however, Green initially pursued a career in business and studied part-time to obtain the degree of B.Sc. from the University of London.Alumni Cantabrigiensis Career Green entered Trinity College in 1881 and gained Firsts in Parts I and II of the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1883 and 1884.Alumni Cantabrigiensis He studied both Botany and Animal Morphology and at that point was drawn to both subjects. In 1885 he was appointed University Demonstrator in Physiology and carried out research into coagulation of the blood and demonstrated that calcium was necessary for the process. In 1887, however, he was appointed Professor of Botany to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and this dictated the course of his future research. Green came to argue that plant physiology rather than simply plant taxonomy should become the basis of botanical study and he did important work in relation to plant enzymes and the protein content of seeds. Green's approach to botany anticipated the development of biochemistry and his work is now regarded as fundamental to the emergence of the science. Green was awarded the Rollaston Prize by the University of Oxford in 1890 and was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Science in 1894.Alumni Cantabrigiensis He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1895 and from 1902 he was a Fellow and Lecturer of Downing College, Cambridge. In 1907 he relinquished his Chair at the Pharmaceutical Society because of ill-health and was appointed to the less demanding position of Hartley Lecturer in Botany at Liverpool University. Green was the author of a number of botanical works including basic primers on the subject, accounts of the historical evolution of the subject as well as academic treatises.

With a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development, it works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know- how to realize them. It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity. It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in dozens of countries around the world. IDLO is headquartered in Rome, Italy and has a branch office in The Hague and is one of a number of entities that are United Nations General Assembly observers. IDLO has operated in dozens of sovereign states, focusing on institution-building and legal empowerment. Its alumni network includes more than 20,000 legal professionals in 175 countries and 46 independent alumni associations. IDLO has signed MoUs with United Nations agencies, governments, universities, and other entities. Major financial contributions to IDLO have come from the Australian Agency for International Development, Gates Foundation, Center for International Forestry Research, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Union, Ford Foundation, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Institute of Medicine, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, OPEC Fund for International Development, United Nations Development Programme, and UNICEF as well as numerous countries, namely Canada, China, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. Jan Beagle is the Director-General of IDLO. History IDLO began in 1983 as a non-governmental organization (then called International Development Law Institute) founded by three legal advisors to cooperation agencies in Egypt: L. Michael Hager (USA), William T. Loris (USA) and Gilles Blanchi (France), with a Board presided by Dr Ibrahim Shihata (Founder of the OPEC Fund for international Development and Senior Vice-President and General Counsel of the World Bank from 1983 to 1998). The Board also included, among others, Professor René David. The Governments of the United States and Italy provided the start-up seed money and the Headquarter establishment agreement was signed in Rome in 1988. The Institute changed to an intergovernmental organization in 1991 after its first Assembly of Member States in 1990. After the Fall of the Berlin Wall, increased training and assistance was provided in the field of legal and judicial reform in developing and transition countries. In the second half of the 90s, greater attention was also given to sustainable development and the civil society as well as to countries emerging from conflicts if not genocides (e.g. Cambodia, Rwanda). In 2002, the institute was renamed International Development Law Organisation. In 2001 IDLO was granted Permanent Observer Status at the United Nations. In 2014, IDLO opened a branch office in The Hague. Governance =Member States= As an inter-governmental organization, membership to the organization is made up of signatories to the Establishment Agreement of IDLO.

Somali Prime Minister, Dr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali has called IDLO \\"a premiere institution that is supporting Somalia on its journey to peace and stability.\\" In recent years, IDLO has worked on supporting the development of a Somali constitution and in the integration of customary justice. In 2011 IDLO created an assessment of traditional and customary justice, arguing that linking customary and traditional justice in a bottom up approach would be most effective. Financed by the Italian government, IDLO worked with local experts on the country's provisional Constitution, holding consultative sessions with Mogadishu residents, refugees, and the Somali diaspora. Towards the adoption of the Constitution, IDLO helped produce a comparative analysis of the new draft Constitution, the Constitution of 1960 and the Transitional Federal Charter of 2004 and supported the Constitutional Affairs and Reconciliation Ministry in hosting a conference on fundamental rights and transitional justice. Following the adoption of the constitution by the National Constitution Assembly on 1 August 2012 IDLO drafted a report on providing analysis and suggestions for Justice and Security development under the new constitutional order. The report provides a description of steps to be taken during the implementation phase of the constitution, including the establishment of institutions, development and revision of legislative frameworks, and capacity building. It also sketches out dispute resolution mechanisms of the three legal systems in Somalia: xeer, Shari’ah, and the statutory judiciary. Comparing the draft constitution to those from 53 of the 56 member states of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation, as well as the constitutions of Italy and the United States of America, IDLO found that it contained 36 of the 45 fundamental rights - placing it in the top five of the countries surveyed. The organization also stated that the Somali draft constitution contained 15 more than the Constitution of the United States of America. =Afghanistan= IDLO has been active in Afghanistan since 2002, stating their intent has been to restore rule of law in the country and develop a new idea of justice, while respecting the principles of Islam. Primarily Afghan staff have been used to train legal professionals in the country. Following a survey taken by the IDLO in 2013 which found that women made up just over 8 percent of the country’s judges, 6 percent of prosecutors and less than one fifth of lawyers, IDLO’s Director General Irene Khan called for greater participation of women in the Afghanistan’s justice sector. Women's Rights Whilst the Constitution of Afghanistan offers protection to women, domestic and sexual violence are common and considered a family matter, dealt through informal justice systems composed of male elders. In June 2009, IDLO launched Afghanistan's first Violence against Women Unit, with support from the office of the Attorney General of Afghanistan. IDLO reports that in 2010 the unit handled more than 300 cases. In December 2010 The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) contributed $12.1 million to expand and improve legal aid services to the poor and disempowered, increase public awareness of legal issues, rights and services, and improve the investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls. On 11 April 2013 INL announced it would provide IDLO a further $59 million for programmes in Afghanistan: $47 million to fund IDLO implement training programmes for the Afghan justice sector – the Justice Training Transition Program (JTTP) – and another $12 million for a separate IDLO program to provide support and training for prosecution of crimes against women.Department of State Press Release U.S. Supports Justice Reform in Afghanistan, South Sudan, Phillip Kurata, US Department of State, 12 April 2013 Allegations of Lack of Oversight In January 2014 the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) released a report highlighting it believed there to be a lack of oversight requirements in INL’s 2013 contract with IDLO in relation to JTTP . SIGAR had previously warned of a lack of monitoring in an ‘alert-letter’ to the State Department sent to the State Department on July 22, 2013. The letter also accused IDLO of refusing to provide SIGAR with information regarding its budget, organizational structure and financial relationship with the US government. In response to SIGAR’s 2013 statement, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said that there were no allegations or evidence of fraud, waste or mismanagement in the program and that oversight was provided through daily contact on the ground. In a letter responding to SIGAR’s claims, INL highlighted mechanisms of accountability and stated their confidence in the IDLO program.Letter Regarding the SIGAR Inspection of INL Justice Training Transition Program, US Department of State September 11, 2013 In a statement posted on their website IDLO called their monitoring and evaluation mechanisms ‘robust and extensive’. IDLO also refuted SIGAR’s statement that it had refused to provide information writing that they had met with SIGAR staff in April and May 2013.IDLO - SIGAR's Letter to Secretary John Kerry incorrect =South Sudan= IDLO provided the newly established country of South Sudan with technical legal assistance; training the judiciary in both the fundamentals of common law and, during the process of transition away from a Shari’ah based legal system, in ‘legal’ English.South Sudan: Law in a Fragile State - IDLO With funding from the European Union in 2014, IDLO scaled up their work in South Sudan, delivering a series of context-specific training courses to 150 newly appointed judges and judicial support staff.Strengthening Justice Institutions in South Sudan IDLO also stated it was providing technical assistance in drafting a permanent Constitution for South Sudan. =Kenya= Working with constitutional scholars Zachary Elkins and Tom Ginsberg, IDLO sponsored a group of constitutional scholars from universities in America to review drafts of the Kenyan constitution and provide feedback to the Kenyan Parliament. In 2013, USAID partnered with IDLO to assist the Government of Kenya develop the comprehensive laws and policies required under the new Constitution, assisting the Kenyan Parliament in reviewing, analysing and passing 55 laws, including 16 required by the Constitution. Investigators in the project used data and analyzed from over 3000 constitutions in the world to share with Kenya’s Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution (CIC) an analysis of the constitutional implementation process. IDLO also implemented projects to strengthen the capacity of the judiciary and engage the public in the process. IDLO has also stated that they are working with the government of Kenya to advance gender equality across the country and enact gender provisions contained in the Constitution. An independent report found that its work in Kenya had provided support and services were delivered to fulfil identified needs COE and ensured the delivery trainings to educate Kenyans on the proposed Constitution before it was put to a national referendum. Despite some challenges, the report notes, IDLO consultants produced and delivered high quality technical reports and services which eventually contributed to the final version of the Constitution of Kenya. A permanent IDLO regional office was set up in Kenya in 2011. =Women and Girls= In a speech at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Director-General Irene Khan highlighted the importance of law in empowering women: > \\"A core principle of the rule of law is that we are all equal - equally > protected by the law and equally accountable to it.\\" The organization’s website states that across all of its programs, IDLO works to empower women.IDLO - Women and Girls In February 2013 IDLO released a report on women’s access to justice, with a focus on improving customary justice for women. =Customary Justice= IDLO has a number of times, including at the UN, emphasized the importance of working with informal or customary justice systems and has released three edited volumes on customary justice.  Controversies  The US government's Office of Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) investigated IDLO's program in Afghanistan titled 'Justice Training Transition Program' (JTTP) funded with $47.8 million of US taxpayer's money. The investigation was conducted by SIGAR at the request of Senator Claire McCaskill who has maintained a long-standing position that she \\"ha[s] serious concerns about the effectiveness of the [Justice Sector Support Program] (that was transitioned to IDLO under the name 'JTTP' but without any changes in substance)\\".[50] JTTP was funded by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) of the United States Department of State. It was and remains to-day the State Department's largest justice program in the world. On July 22, 2013, SIGAR issued an alert letter to Secretary of State John Kerry alerting Secretary Kerry to the following: (1) JTTP was granted to IDLO as a sole source award (absent any competitive process); (2) there were very few oversight provisions in the State Department's contract with IDLO; (3) State Department told SIGAR that \\"they d[id] not have the authority to demand basic organizational and project information from IDLO because it is an international organization;\\" (4) State Department violated its own contracting policy when it issued the JTTP contract to IDLO; (5) SIGAR found that \\"IDLO is ill-prepared to manage and account for how U.S.-taxpayer funds will be spent on the JTTP; (6) in the years leading up to JTTP IDLO's funding had decreased; (7) IDLO lacks proper international financial certifications; and (8) IDLO refused to fully comply with SIGAR's repeated requests for information. SIGAR concluded that \\"it was ill-considered for [the State Department] to have awarded almost $50 million to an organization that may not have the ability to account for the use of those funds, under an agreement in which [the State Department] failed to require proper provisions for oversight\\".[51] SIGAR stated that in light of IDLO's refusal to provide information \\"it may [...] be necessary to subpoena IDLO to compel the production of any and all records IDLO possesses related to its operations in Afghanistan\\".[51] IDLO responded by calling the SIGAR assessment contained in the alert letter of July 22, 2013 \\"incorrect\\".[52] State Department sought to defend its position by justifying his sole-source award to IDLO by stating that \\"they are the best positioned to do this work, period, as they are the only not-for-profit intergovernmental organization that is exclusively dedicated to working with governments to promote the rule of law\\",[53] without elaborating on this assertion in any manner that could reasonably allay SIGAR's substantive and detailed concerns. In January 2014, SIGAR issued a full report entitled 'Support for Afghanistan's Justice Sector: State Department Programs Need Better Management and Stronger Oversight'.[54] In that report SIGAR found the following in relation to IDLO: (1) JTTP was transferred to IDLO despite the management and financial challenges IDLO was facing at the time; (2) IDLO's high leadership turnover and budgetary shortfalls, by IDLO's own admission, raised serious questions about the future sustainability of the organization; (3) State Department has limited authority to oversee IDLO's work; and (4) State failed to secure contractual provisions to oversee IDLO. Despite this report JTTP was allowed to proceed without changes. SIGAR launched a fresh investigation into IDLO in December, 2015. In 2016, the US Department of Justice launched an investigation of certain individuals associated with IDLO's Justice Training Transition Program. Describing the early days of IDLO in Afghanistan, some have summed up its key achievements as follows: (1) \\"rent[ing]\\" one of the largest NGO offices in Kabul;\\" and (2) \\"creati[ng] a digital compilation of Afghan laws that it declined to share\\" (Deena Hurwitz et al, Human Rights Stories). A former Interior Minister of Afghanistan describes Italy's efforts, that were largely conducted through IDLO, in the following manner: \\"Italian-sponsored justice sector reform suffers from a very low level of human resources and infrastructure capacity\\" (id).

He is the oldest man to have ridden the Derby winner and one of the very few to have both ridden and trained the winner.  Career  Forth rose to prominence in the horseracing world late in life. There is no record of him having any major race victories as a young man, either as jockey or trainer. The peak of his career came only in 1829 when, aged 60, he performed the remarkable feat of both riding and training the Derby winner. As far as records are known, this also makes him the oldest jockey to win the Derby. A year prior, he had placed a bet with a bookmaker named Crockford that he would win the race on a horse, The Exquisite, which he trained and planned to ride. Over the winter, however, he decided that Frederick, another horse in his stable, would be a more likely winner. He therefore asked Crockford to change his bet, and the bookmaker consented, considering neither to have a chance. Frederick won at 40/1, while Forth's other horse, The Exquisite, ridden by Frank Buckle, finished second, beaten just a head, at 50/1. Forth would train a second winner of the Derby in 1840 - Little Wonder for David Robertson, 1st Baron Marjoribanks. Forth later became embroiled in a Derby scandal when Leander, owned by a German horse-dealer friend of his, broke its leg and died running in the 1844 Derby. Accusations were made that Leander was a four-year- old and therefore ineligible for the race (the Derby being a race for three- year-olds). To settle the matter, the horse was disinterred to check its mouth, as a way of telling its correct age. On exhumation, however, the horse's lower jaw was found to be missing, Forth having removed it earlier to protect his friend. The following year's Derby would be happier for Forth, recording a second win as a trainer with The Merry Monarch, ridden by Foster Bell. Both Forth's Derby winners were owned by G. William Gratwicke of Angmering, Sussex, heir to a fortune. Gratwicke had Frederick buried on his estate, under what is now the 18th green of Ham Manor golf course.  Personal life  Forth married Hannah Townsend (died 1825). They had at least one son, H. T. Forth (died 1852) and one daughter (1797-1830).

On 27 January 2015, the Kepler spacecraft is reported to have confirmed the detection of five sub-Earth-sized rocky exoplanets orbiting the main star. The star is a K type star. According to NASA, no life as we know it could exist on these hot exoplanets, due to their close orbital distances to the host star. Discovery Preliminary results of the planetary system around Kepler-444 were first announced at the second Kepler science conference in 2013. At that conference, the star was known as KOI-3158. Characteristics The star, Kepler-444, is approximately 11.2 billion years old, whereas the Sun is only 4.6 billion years old. The age is that of Kepler-444 A, an orange main sequence star of spectral type K0. The original research on Kepler-444 was published in The Astrophysical Journal on 27 January 2015 under the title \\"An ancient extrasolar system with five sub-Earth-size planets\\" by a team of 40 authors, the abstract reads as follows: > The chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii less > than four Earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant > hosts, which tend to be metal-rich. This implies that small, including > Earth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the > Universe's history when metals were more scarce. We report Kepler spacecraft > observations of Kepler-444, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old > population of the Galactic thick disk and the host to a compact system of > five transiting planets with sizes between those of Mercury and Venus. We > validate this system as a true five-planet system orbiting the target star > and provide a detailed characterization of its planetary and orbital > parameters based on an analysis of the transit photometry. Kepler-444 is the > densest star with detected solar-like oscillations. We use asteroseismology > to directly measure a precise age of 11.2+/-1.0 Gyr for the host star, > indicating that Kepler-444 formed when the Universe was less than 20% of its > current age and making it the oldest known system of terrestrial-size > planets.

The age of Kepler-444 not only > suggests that thick-disk stars were among the hosts to the first Galactic > planets, but may also help to pinpoint the beginning of the era of planet > formation.\\" The star is believed to have 2 M dwarfs in orbit around it with > the fainter companion 1.8 arc-seconds from the main star. Stellar system The Kepler-444 system consists of the planet hosting primary and a pair of M-dwarf stars. The M-dwarfs orbit each other at a distance of less than 0.3 AU while the pair orbits the primary in a highly eccentric 198 year orbit. The pair comes within 5 AU of the primary potentially severely truncating the protoplanetary disk from which the planets formed at 1–2 AU. This would have depleted the availability of solid material to form the observed planets. Planetary system All five rocky exoplanets (Kepler-444b; Kepler-444c; Kepler-444d; Kepler-444e; Kepler-444f) are confirmed, smaller than the size of Venus (but bigger than Mercury) and each of the exoplanets completes an orbit around the host star in less than 10 days. The system is also very compact and Kepler-444b is the smallest at 0.403 earth diameters, and even the furthest planet, Kepler-444f, still orbits closer to the star than Mercury is to the Sun. According to NASA, no life as we know it could exist on these hot exoplanets, due to their close orbital distances to the host star. To keep known planetary system stable, no additional giant planets can be located within 5.5 AU from the parent star.

Fatty acid hydroperoxides generated by plant lipoxygenases from linoleic and linolenic acids are known to serve as substrates for a divinyl ether synthase which produces divinyl ether fatty acids. Up to date divinyl ethers were detected only within the plant kingdom. The discovery of that class of compounds dates back to 1972, when the structures of two ether C18 fatty acids generated by homogenates of the potato tuber were described. These compounds, named colneleic acid (from linoleic acid) and colnelenicacid (from linolenic acid), could be also produced in potato leaves and tomato roots by rearrangement of 9-hydroperoxides. Isomers of colneleic and colnelenic acids were isolated from homogenates of leaves of Clematis vitalba (Ranunculaceae). Similarly, 13-lipoxygenase-generated hydroperoxides serve as precursor of other divinyl ether fatty acids which are produced in bulbs of garlic or Ranunculus leaves. These compounds were named etheroleic and etherolenic acids. Etheroleic acid has systematic name 12-[1′E-hexenyloxy]-9Z,11Z-dodecadienoic acid. Etherolenic acid has systematic name (9Z,11E,1'E,3'Z)-12-(1',3'-Hexadienyloxy)-9,11-dodecadienoic acid. The physiological significance of divinyl ethers is still not fully studied. As infection of potato leaves leads to increased levels of divinyl ether synthase, it was suggested that this pathway could be of importance in the defense of plants against attacking pathogens. Similar structures have been discovered in the brown alga Laminaria sinclairii, with 18 or 20 carbons and 4, 5 or 6 double bonds, and in the red alga Polyneura latissima, with 20 carbons and 5 double bonds.

It is more specifically used to describe the work of American designers in the late 1860s and 1870s. It was loosely based on the Picturesque period of English architecture in the 1830s and is used in the stick style of architecture.  History  During the 1830s and 1840s, American home builders started interpreting the European Gothic Revival architecture, which had elaborate masonry details, in wood to decorate American timber frame homes. The early designs started with simple stickwork such as vertical sawtooth siding. By the middle of the 19th century, with the invention of the steam-powered scroll saw, the mass production of thin boards that were cut into a variety of ornamental parts had helped builders to transform simple cottages into unique houses. Not everyone agreed with this architectural style. Andrew Jackson Downing, a prominent advocate of the Gothic Revival criticized this style in his Architecture of Country Houses in 1852. He classified homes in the United States into three types: villas for the wealthy, cottages for working people and farmhouses for farmers. He argued that the lower-cost cottages which were small in size and had simplistic style should not be ornamented with elaborated embellishment of a villa. He also pointed out that the vergeboard of the Rural Gothic gable should have been carefully carved in thick and solid plank to appreciate its beauty instead of an ornamental part which was \\"sawn out of thin board, so as to have a frippery and 'gingerbread' look which (degraded), rather than (elevated), the beauty of the cottage.\\" The style lived on and became flourished in the residential areas of Chicago in the 1860s. That didn't last very long, the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 destroyed many of those buildings. Some attributed a cause of the fire to be worsen to the cheap construction materials and the gingerbread decorations in hoping other cities would heed the warning. Still, the style continued to spread to the West. By the 1870s, San Francisco had many gingerbread houses at a similar level of Chicago ten years earlier. In 1878, a fire in Cape May, New Jersey destroyed 30 blocks of properties of this seaside town. The town rebuilt quickly. Many of those were built with much gingerbread trim and many gables and turrets. This resulted in a high concentration of late 19th century buildings in the town. According to the National Register of Historic Places, \\"Cape May has one of the largest collections of late 19th century frame buildings left in the United States. It contains over 600 summer houses, old hotels, and commercial structures that give it a homogeneous architectural character, a kind of textbook of vernacular American building.\\"  In Haiti  A gingerbread house in Port-au-Prince. Wooden residential buildings of wealthy individuals in Haiti during the Gingerbread era between 1880 and 1920 had a unique architecture that combined the local traditions and adaptation of foreign influences. The adaptation was influenced by many factors including manuals of styles that were circulated from Europe and North America, Haitian architects who studied abroad, and French artisans who set up woodworking shops to train Haitian artisans. Those Gingerbread houses were highly decorative with fretworks, latticeworks with patterns that are unique to Haiti. The structures of this style typically have large windows and doors, tall ceilings, large attics, and deep porches. Gingerbread was coined by American tourists in the 1950s, who appreciated the style which bore similarity to that of the Victorian-era buildings with gingerbread trim in the United States. =History= The movement of the style began in 1881 with the Haitian National Palace. In 1895, three young Haitians—, Léon Mathon, and Joseph-Eugène Maximilien—traveled to Paris to study architecture, were inspired to build upon the nascent architectural movement, and modified the style to the climate in Haiti by designing homes with vibrant patterns and flamboyant colors to the French resort architecture. =Characteristics= The gingerbread house by design combines architectural knowledge that stemmed abroad, into an understanding of the Caribbean climate and its living conditions. They were constructed with tall doors, high ceilings, with steep turret roofs to redirect hot air above its inhabitable rooms, along with a cross-breeze of louvred shutter windows on all sides instead of glass to offset the most scorching of days, and flexible timber frames with the innate ability to weather some of the toughest storms and tremors, built with wrap- around verandas. The houses are usually constructed out of wood, masonry, or stone and clay. =Preservation= This specific architectural heritage in Haiti is now seriously threatened as the natural aging of the wood, the weather, the high cost of restoration and repairs are all detrimental to the survival of this style. The style has been nominated to the 2010 World Monuments Watch. Surprisingly, only five percent of the estimated 300,000 houses were partially or fully collapsed due to the 2010 earthquake, in contrast to 40% of all other structures that had been considered to be in better condition, which leaves U.S. conservation experts to believe that this architecture can be a model for seismic-resistant activity of the future.

She was the mother of two notable sons. Early life and writings Louisa Capper was born on 15 November 1776 at Fort St George, Madras, India. She was the youngest daughter of Mary (née Johnson) and Colonel James Capper, an officer in the army of the East India Company, known as a writer and meteorologist. Her grandfather, Francis Capper, was a London barrister; her uncle of the same name was a Church of England clergyman. She is chiefly remembered for writing An Abridgment of Locke's Essay concerning the Human Understanding, published in 1811. Her Children's Stories however were a more profound contribution to the history of literature, marking a departure into a new populous genre in early Victorian readers. She was a pioneer of writing directly for children in a modern idiom. A Poetical History of England (1810) is also attributed to Capper, being a versed history of England from Roman times to the start of the House of Hanover in 1714. It ran to a second edition in 1815.James Fitzjames: The Mystery Man of the Franklin Expedition.. Page 30 Her history was republished in 2012 as A Poetical History of England; written for the use of the young ladies educated at Rothbury-House School, etc, by the British Library. Marriage and motherhood Louisa Capper married, on 16 October 1811, the Reverend Robert Coningham. His respect for her was such that on re-writing his will, he made her sole executrix and guardian. Much of his money came from slave sugar in St Vincent, where his uncle Walter Coningham had made a fortune at Colonarie Vale. Robert received a share of the money paid by the British government under the Slave Compensation Act 1837. She gave birth to at least two children, but only one lived to adulthood: William Coningham, the art collector and politician. Her first child, John, was born in 1812 or 1813, when she was 35, and died in infancy. William was born near Penzance in 1815. She took into her household the infant James Fitzjames, and raised him as a brother to her son; he achieved fame by volunteering for the doomed Arctic exploration known as the Franklin Expedition. Through a 2010 biography of Fitzjames, much of her life has become clearer. Rose Hill and later life Capper and her husband lived in Cornwall, then Watford, before settling in the 1820s at Rose Hill, Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire. They lived in quiet comfort, near enough to London to be in touch with cultural developments but in a pleasant country atmosphere. Rose Hill was a substantial household to run, of about 30 acres, with several indoor and outdoor servants. The house itself, built in the 1820s, sat immediately above the Grand Junction Canal,Rosehill: which had opened in 1800. The London and Birmingham Railway was constructed along the same valley during the 1830s, in the teeth of land-owners' opposition. (See also the Modern history of Hertfordshire.) In the 1870s, Rose Hill was home to the civil engineer George Turnbull; it was demolished in 1952. The Rose Hill social circle consisted of extended family and travelling friends, as well as neighbours such as the Earl of Essex at Cassiobury House. Robert Coningham's widowed mother, born Elizabeth Campbell, lived with them. His cousins included John Sterling, the writer and man of letters, and his brother Anthony Coningham Sterling, Army officer and historian. Louisa Capper's elder sister Marianne married Robert Clutterbuck, author of the county history of Hertford; the two married sisters lived near one another for many years. Louisa was responsible for a happy and well-run home. One of her visitors was Jane Carlyle, who describes Rose Hill as a sort of Eden: \\"a perfect Paradise of a place, peopled as every Paradise ought to be with Angels\\", filled with \\"cheerful countenances\\" only too happy to cater for her every happiness.Quoted in chapter 1 \\"Tracking down James Fitzjames\\". James Fitzjames: The Mystery Man of the Franklin Expedition by William Battersby. 2010. Fitzjames's letters home refer to Louisa's and William's illnesses; she took her son to Cheltenham, Switzerland, and Boulogne in search of cures. She died on 25 May 1840 at Chorleywood and is buried at Rickmansworth, both in Hertfordshire.

Coskewness is the third standardized cross central moment, related to skewness as covariance is related to variance. In 1976, Krauss and Litzenberger used it to examine risk in stock market investments. The application to risk was extended by Harvey and Siddique in 2000. If two random variables exhibit positive coskewness they will tend to undergo extreme positive deviations at the same time. Similarly, if two random variables exhibit negative coskewness they will tend to undergo extreme negative deviations at the same time.  Definition  For three random variables X, Y and Z, the non-trivial coskewness statistic is defined as: : S(X,Y,Z) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[(X-\\\\operatorname{E}[X])(Y-\\\\operatorname{E}[Y])(Z-\\\\operatorname{E}[Z])\\\\right]} {\\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y \\\\sigma_Z} where E[X] is the expected value of X, also known as the mean of X, and \\\\sigma_X is the standard deviation of X.  Properties  Skewness is a special case of the coskewness when the three random variables are identical: : S(X,X,X) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[(X - \\\\operatorname{E}[X])^3\\\\right]}{\\\\sigma_X^3} = {\\\\operatorname{skewness}[X]}, For two random variables, X and Y, the skewness of the sum, X + Y, is : S_{X+Y} = {1 \\\\over \\\\sigma_{X+Y}^3}{\\\\left[ \\\\sigma_X^3S_X + 3\\\\sigma_X^2\\\\sigma_YS(X,X,Y) + 3\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y^2S(X,Y,Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^3S_Y \\\\right]}, where SX is the skewness of X and \\\\sigma_X is the standard deviation of X. It follows that the sum of two random variables can be skewed (SX+Y ≠ 0) even if both random variables have zero skew in isolation (SX = 0 and SY = 0). The coskewness between variables X and Y does not depend on the scale on which the variables are expressed. If we are analyzing the relationship between X and Y, the coskewness between X and Y will be the same as the coskewness between a + bX and c + dY, where a, b, c, and d are constants. Example Let X be standard normally distributed and Y be the distribution obtained by setting X=Y whenever X<0 and drawing Y independently from a standard half-normal distribution whenever X>0. In other words, X and Y are both standard normally distributed with the property that they are completely correlated for negative values and uncorrelated apart from sign for positive values. The joint probability density function is :f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\\\frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\left(H(-x)\\\\delta(x-y) + 2H(x)H(y) \\\\frac{e^{-y^2/2}}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\right) where H(x) is the Heaviside step function and δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. The third moments are easily calculated by integrating with respect to this density: :S(X,X,Y) = S(X,Y,Y) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\approx -0.399 Note that although X and Y are individually standard normally distributed, the distribution of the sum X+Y is significantly skewed. From integration with respect to density, we find that the covariance of X and Y is :\\\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y) = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} from which it follows that the standard deviation of their sum is :\\\\sigma_{X+Y} = \\\\sqrt{3 + \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}} Using the skewness sum formula above, we have :S_{X+Y} = -\\\\frac{3\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\pi}{(2+3\\\\pi)^{3/2}} \\\\approx -0.345 This can also be computed directly from the probability density function of the sum: :f_{X+Y}(u) = \\\\frac{e^{-u^2/8}}{2\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} H(-u) + \\\\frac{e^{-u^2/4}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} \\\\operatorname{erf}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u}{2}\\\\right) H(u)  See also  * Moment (mathematics) * Cokurtosis  References   Further reading  * * Category:Algebra of random variables Category:Theory of probability distributions Category:Covariance and correlation ","title":"Coskewness"},{"id":"45233473","title":"1951 Sint Maarten general election"},{"id":"45233484","title":"1955 Sint Maarten general election"},{"id":"45233491","title":"1959 Sint Maarten general election"},{"id":"45233512","title":"1963 Sint Maarten general election"},{"id":"45233535","title":"1967 Sint Maarten general election"},{"id":"45233543","title":"1971 Sint Maarten general election"},{"id":"45233552","text":"Woodridge is a town in North Dakota.

The series began with a one- shot story titled that was released on February 28, 2015. The serialization itself started on August 28, 2017 in Shogakukan's Monthly Flowers Josei magazine. Byakko Senki is a prequel to Fushigi Yûgi and a sequel to Fushigi Yûgi Genbu Kaiden, and tells the story of the Priestess of Byakko, Suzuno Osugi, in the land of Sairou after she was transported into the \\"Universe of the Four Gods\\". The Byakko Ibun one-shot, on the other hand, sets the mood of the story by introducing the other protagonist of the story, a girl from Sairou named Neiran, and her companion Nirusha. In North America, Viz Media announced that they have licensed the manga for an English language release in August 2020. Synopsis: Byakko Ibun Some time between Genbu Kaiden and Byakko Senki, a man named Nirusha arrives to a small village in the country of Sairou. The village is under the attack of a wild tiger, and the only person who accepts to help him strike it down is the youngest daughter of the local inn keeper, a little girl named Reipin. He then hides away from the suspicious villagers, but Reipin comes to his presence and tries to befriend him. She turns out to have a terrible life, full of neglect and abuse from her family, and Nirusha is the first person who has ever been kind to her. Nirusha renames her \\"Neiran\\" and tells her about his past, and the two try to help one another... Synopsis: Byakko Senki In 1923, near immediately following the epilogue of Genbu Kaiden, the scholar Takao Ōsugi brings the book of Universe of Four Gods back to Tokyo under the will of the deceased translator of the book, Einosuke Okuda, to find a way to destroy it or seal it away. No matter what he does, however, the book is not affected by anything. Takao fears deeply for his 8-year-old daughter Suzuno Ōsugi, who may be trapped into the book just like Takiko Okuda (the Genbu Kaiden heroine, whom Suzuno considered an older sister figure) was; even more, the book is sometimes found near Suzuno. Months later, the great Kantō earthquake takes place. The Osugi house collapses, Takao's wife Tamayo is killed and Takao is mortally wounded, but then Suzuno turns out to be all right and has the Universe in her hands. Takao realizes that this is the doing of the Universe and that Suzuno is destined to be a Priestess. So with his last words, he orders Suzuno to open the book and get inside it for her own safety, telling her that she'll find her own destiny like Takiko. Lost in the wide desert, Suzuno meets Neiran, an outcast young woman who can transform into a fierce tiger (and one of the protagonists of Byakko Ibun), and the kindhearted brothers Kasaru and Karumu Raotsue. After a short time, the three recognize Suzuno fitting the description of the outlandish priestess who is destined to summon the godly beast of Byakko and save the country from the inevitable peril. When Neiran is tasked to escort Suzuno to the royal guards, the mentally unstable girl snaps and attempts to kill Suzuno, but she is transported back to reality. Neiran then imposes herself as the priestess, to avenge her tragic past in which she was abused by near every person that she met, save for a man named Nirusha (the other Byakko Ibun lead). Suzuno finds herself all alone in the destroyed Tokyo, but by a stroke of luck she's found by Doctor Oikawa, a friend of her father and Takiko's former fiancé. The kind doctor adopts her and three other orphans (Seiji Horie, Hideo and Kenichi), but Suzuno loses sight of the book itself. Ten years pass. Suzuno is in her last year of high school and has become a promising artist... but then finds the Universe in her school's library. This triggers her lost memories of her adventures inside the book, so she starts making research on its translator to see what's going on. Soon, she and her foster father Oikawa find out everything about the tragedy of the Okuda family, Takiko's position as the Priestess of Genbu, and last but not least the truth of the book: that the priestess is to be devoured by the godly beast upon being granted all three wishes. Scared and hesitant about this grim destiny, Suzuno accepts the proposal of her adopted brother Seiji to escape that fate, but the book suddenly appears before and absorbs her again right before the eyes of Oikawa and her fiancé...

It is located in the village of Fitjar. It is the church for the Fitjar parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1867 using designs by the architect John O. Kaarhus from Skånevik. The church seats about 425 people. History The first church at Fitjar was probably built in the middle ages in the early 1100s, not long after the Old Moster Church was built since the two churches had similar designs. The medieval church was built of stone and it probably did not have a steeple. The main part of the church was approximately . Prior to 1862, Fitjar Church was an annex to the large parish of Stord. In 1862, Fitjar was split off to form its own parish. At that time, it was decided that the old church was too small for the new parish. In 1867, the old church was torn down and a new wooden church was built immediately to the south of the old stone church. Stone from the old church was used in building the foundation for the new church. There were also many items from the old church that were kept and are still used in the new church including the old altarpiece, some brass candlesticks, and the baptismal font.

The leaves are long and . The flower stem is tall, tall and smooth. The flowers appear from August to October and are green and white, . Flowering is stimulated by summer fires. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis pyramidalis was first formally described by John Lindley in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony in 1840. The genus Pterostylis has been reviewed by David Jones and Mark Clements who changed the name from P. pyramidalis to Linguella pyramidalis but the new name has not been widely accepted, including by the Western Australian Herbarium.

In 1987, he published a study on accidental gun deaths among children in California, of which 88 occurred between 1977 and 1983. The same study found that in about one-third of incidents, the shooter did not know the gun was loaded or real. At a press conference to announce the study's results, multiple real guns like those involved in the accidental deaths were placed next to toy lookalikes; few of the reporters in attendance could tell them apart. His research on Saturday night special handguns, especially a 1994 study he published entitled \\"Ring of Fire\\", has been credited as the main reason for the California government's efforts to impose strict regulations on them.

He was a significant figure in the development of American Modernism after World War I. He worked with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to complete four murals in the 1930s. For the most part, his paintings depict the life and landscapes of the Provincetown, Massachusetts area. Biography = Early life = Born on February 2, 1888 in Clearfield, Iowa. Moffett began his studies at the Cummins Art School of Des Moines in 1907. In 1908 he transferred to the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts (now known as the Art Institute of Chicago) and studied with John Vanderpool and Harry Wallcott. He then studied with Charles Hawthorne, in Provincetown, Massachusetts in the summer of 1913. In 1914, he continued his studies at the Art Students League of New York, returning to Provincetown to establish his career as an artist in 1915. As one of the founders of the Provincetown Art Association, he was a leading figure in the town's art scene. Moffett married artist Dorothy Lake Gregory, best known as a printmaker and illustrator of children's books and magazines, in 1920, in Brooklyn, New York. Moffett and Gregory met while studying in Provincetown under Charles Hawthorne. = Career = In 1924, after serving in the United States Army and traveling across Europe, Moffett returned to Provincetown, Massachusetts and became one of the early founders of the Provincetown Art Association and Museum (PAAM). Moffett had his first one-man show at the Frank Rehn Gallery in New York and also at The Art Institute of Chicago in 1928. Between 1932 and 1933, he taught at the University of Miami in Ohio and, in 1942, Moffett became a full member of the National Academy of Design. Moffett painted four murals in two Massachusetts post offices for the Federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) between 1936 and 1938. Although he deepened his commitment to the Provincetown Art Association, his output lessened during World War 2. Moffett became interested in archaeology in the 1950s, delivered a few lectures on the subject, and wrote an article for American Antiquity entitled \\"A Shell Heap Site on Griffin Island, Wellfleet, Massachusetts\\" which appeared in Volume 28 No 1. In 1954, he was chosen, along with another artist, to paint murals of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's civilian life for the new Eisenhower Memorial Foundation Museum by the National Academy of Design. In 1960, Moffett joined the movement to establish acreage known as the Province Lands as part of the Cape Cod National Seashore Park. He wrote and published a definitive history of the first thirty-three years of the Provincetown Art Association in a book titled Art in Narrow Streets in 1964. He continued serving as a juror for the Provincetown Art Association and, in 1970, was artist-in-residence for the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center. =Later life= Ross Moffett's A Skirmish Between British and Colonists near Somerville in Revolutionary Times, 1937 Moffett died of cancer on March 13, 1971, in Provincetown, Massachusetts and is buried at the Provincetown cemetery next to his wife, Dorothy who died in 1975. The Moffett House, 296A Commercial Street, Provincetown, Massachusetts was built in 1860. It is the former location of the home and studio of Ross Moffett and his wife Dorothy.

While the term DSE can apply to any kind of system, we refer to electronic and embedded system design in this article. Given the complex specification of electronic systems and the plethora of design choices ranging from the choice of components, number of components, operating modes of each of the components, connections between the components, choice of algorithm, etc.; design decisions need to be based on a systematic exploration process. However, the exploration process is complex because of a variety of ways in which the same functionality can be implemented. A tradeoff analysis between each of the implementation option based on a certain parameter of interest forms the basis of DSE. The parameter of interest could vary across systems, but the commonly used parameters are power, performance, and cost. Additional factors like size, shape, weight, etc. can be important for some handheld systems like cellphone and tablets. With growing usage of mobile devices, energy is also becoming a mainstream optimization parameter along with power and performance. Owing to the complexity of the exploration process, researchers have proposed automated DSE where the exploration software is able to take decisions and comes up with the optimal solution. However, it is not possible to have an automated DSE for all kind of systems and hence there are semi-automated methods of DSE where the designer has to steer the tool after every iteration towards convergence. Since the exploration is a complex process which takes large computational time, researchers have developed exploration tools which can give an approximate analysis of the system behavior in a fraction of time compared to accurate analysis. Such tools are very important for quick comparison of design decisions and are becoming more important with increasing complexity of designs. To simplify the complexity of DSE, researchers have been continuously striving to raise the abstractions of component and system definition to be able to cater to larger and complex systems. For example, instead of modeling a digital system at transistor or gate level, there have been attempts to use RTL or behavioral modeling. Further higher abstractions like SystemC or block diagram based modeling are also used depending on the system requirements. Modeling at higher abstractions allows fast exploration of various design choices for the lower level implementation. The ability to operate on the space of design candidates makes DSE useful for many engineering tasks, such as rapid prototyping, optimization, and system integration.

Built at a time of vast land speculation in Colbert County, the house represents the then-fashionable Spanish eclectic style not commonly found in the rural deep South. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History The house was built in 1924, amid a period of land speculation throughout The Shoals. In 1921, industrialist Henry Ford offered to buy two ammonium nitrate plants (constructed to manufacture ammunition, but which Ford would repurpose for fertilizer) and the partially completed Wilson Dam from the government. Ford later proposed to build an industrial city stretching for along the Tennessee River to Huntsville. Developers began buying farmland to build subdivisions and towns. One company, the Bernard Home Building Company, based in Baltimore, Maryland, purchased land to develop in an area they named Ford City. They began construction on one house, in Spanish Eclectic style, before Ford abandoned his plans in the face of opposition from Congress. The house was purchased at auction in 1930 by Clyde and Cleo Carter after the builder defaulted on the mortgage. Carter finished the house and worked the surrounding lands, planting corn and cotton, eventually acquiring 24 acres (10 ha). Due to its proximity to Wilson Dam, the house was one of the first to have electrical service after the Rural Electrification Act. After Clyde Carter died in 1958, his wife Cleo lived in the house until her death in 1972. The Carters' daughters owned the house until 2000, when a granddaughter inherited the house. Architecture The Spanish eclectic architectural style was first exhibited at the Panama–California Exposition in San Diego in 1915. Bertram Goodhue, the exposition's designer, combined Spanish Colonial and Mission Revival architecture with cues from other styles with ties to Spain, including Byzantine, Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque. The style took hold in the years following World War I as an offshoot of the more popular Spanish Colonial Revival style. It was most widely seen in Southern California and Florida, including homes built for screenwriter Frances Marion, director Cecil B. DeMille, and actor Charlie Chaplin. The Clyde Carter house has a flat, parapet roof, with a decorative course of brick. The façade is clad in stucco, and the base is scored to mimic a stone finish. The main entrance has a sidelight and is flanked by two single-pane windows. The elaborate metal storm door and front porch balustrade are obvious cues of the Spanish Eclectic style. When Carter finished the house in the 1930s, he added a screened porch with a gable roof; this was destroyed in a 1972 tornado and partially enclosed with board and batten siding to create a sunroom. A porte-cochère extends from the south side of the house, covering a courtyard garden with a dogwood and Confederate jasmine. The interior retains its original wood panel doors, baseboards, and crown molding.

It is located in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. The mission of the organization is \\"to explore the relationship between cultural production and social movements.\\" History Interference Archive began as the personal collection of Josh MacPhee and Dara Greenwald, activists who told the New York Times that they had filled their home with so much \\"social movement memorabilia ... Ph.D. students would visit to conduct research.\\" The idea to turn it into a public resource began in 2008 when the couple was asked to curate an exhibition at the Exit Art gallery in Manhattan. Using the title \\"Signs of Change,\\" it showcased cultural artifacts produced by those engaged with groups organizing to foment change. The show and research they did in preparation for it is reflected in the Interference Archive mission statement which begins, \\"Interference Archive explores the relationship between cultural production and social movements.\\" MacPhee and Greenwald also point to archives and libraries of similar scope and purpose as inspiration, including another Brooklyn-based organization, the Lesbian Herstory Archives. In 2010 MacPhee and Greenwald moved their collection to a warehouse in Gowanus, in collaboration with activists and artists Molly Fair and Kevin Caplicki. Greenwald named it Interference Archive, referring to \\"the idea that the collection causes static, or interference, in institutional archives and in the larger society.\\" It opened its doors to the public in December 2011 with a punk and feminism themed exhibition in tribute to Greenwald, who had been struggling with endometrial cancer and died the following month. Exterior of the Interference Archive's location in Park Slope, Brooklyn The rising prominence and popularity of the Occupy movement emerged as one specific motivation around the time of the Archive's opening, when its founders observed among Occupy participants a need for information about social movements of the past. Interference Archive has broadened its activities significantly since opening, operating as a library and community space and hosting regular talks, art exhibitions, performances, workshops, and other events. The Guardians Edward Helmore, assessing the place of the Archive among other arts institutions, described it as \\"far removed from the realm of commercial art galleries, oligarch collectors, the show-palace museums of billionaire real estate developers, and under the watch of gun-toting revolutionaries from several decades back -- and is far the richer for it.\\" it operates on a yearly budget of less than $25,000, supported primarily by donations from a community of financial sustainers. In October 2017, after being evicted from their space in Gowanus, the archive relocated to the nearby Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn and reopened to the public in December 2017. The inaugural exhibit in the new space entitled no. NOT EVER opened in January 2018. The exhibit was a multidisciplinary and video-based exploration of \\"the rise of white nationalism\\" in America. Collection The archive is housed in an open floor-plan storefront space, filled to the ceiling. The collection includes a number of different kinds of media artifacts which provide information and illustration about the histories of radical political movements around the world, with 40% of the archive coming from outside the United States. Among the materials are posters, fliers, pamphlets, zines, stickers, T-shirts, books, graphic novels, newspapers, games, videos, leaflets, buttons, audio recordings, and other ephemera. The topics it covers includes ACT-UP, Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring, Code Pink, Pink Bloque, Rock for Choice, Latin American art, nature, ecology, feminism, punk rock, criminal justice, prison reform, apartheid, anti-nuclear movement, squatting, anarchist bookfairs, May 1968 events in France, and Dutch anti-fur activism. MacPhee summarizes the conceptual basis for the collection as \\"material produced by people organizing to transform the world\\". The owners and volunteers take a pointedly nontraditional approach to archivism. In selection and acquisition, no priority is given to particular movements, media types, or well-known artists. Instead, it positions itself as a commons where people can share what they have and benefit from what was donated by others. Whereas most archives stress materials protection and preservation, the Interference Archive promotes access, physical engagement, and use of the materials to maintain their continued relevance outside of the Archive. Collections are also organized for usability, prioritizing media type and subject over donation or donor. Events and activities La Persistencia de los Sueños / The Persistence of Dreams event, a retrospective of the work of Mexican graphics collective Sublevarte in November 2012 In addition to its primary purpose as an archive and library, Interference Archive also functions as a multipurpose community center, gallery, and events space. Past events and exhibitions have covered prison reform, the Asian American movement in New York, underground newspapers, the anti-nuclear movement, and Art+Feminism edit-a-thons. Armed by Design, a 2015 exhibition, comprised graphic art from Tricontinental, a magazine published by the Cuba-based anti-globalization, anti-imperialist, anticapitalist organization OSPAAL (Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America). The Guardian described it as \\"a fascinating tour of 60s and 70s radical politics and its heroes\\". In addition to historical materials and preexisting cultural products, the Archive occasionally commissions artists to produce original work. For Armed by Design, the 60s and 70s graphics were supplemented by a new set of topical posters. Another exhibit, if a song could be freedom... Organized Sounds of Resistance, included a series of annotated mixtapes compiled by musicians, historians, and activists. One exhibit in April 2013 featured \\"book blocs\\", home-made cardboard shields glued together by activists for use during college tuition protests. The shields on display as well as others made during a workshop earlier in the month were confiscated as weapons by the New York Police Department the day before they were due to be used at Cooper Union in a protest against the school's decision to begin charging tuition. Since 2015, volunteers have hosted a podcast which highlights material in the collections and associated exhibits.

Bowman (October 31, 1847 April 8, 1928) was a major general in the Pennsylvania National Guard, and served as commander of the 28th Infantry Division. Early life Wendell Phillips Bowman was born in Byberry, Pennsylvania on October 31, 1847. He lived at his family's home, \\"Cream Ridge,\\" and was educated at the Benjamin Rush School and the Byberry Friends' School. American Civil War He was still a boy when the American Civil War broke out in 1861, and was too young for military service, so he became a drummer for a militia unit, the Byberry Guards. At age 15 he joined the 44th Pennsylvania Militia, which was later mustered into federal service as a unit of the Pennsylvania Reserves. He was a participant in the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, and was discharged later in 1863. In July, 1864 Bowman joined the 197th Pennsylvania Infantry, and he served until November. He then joined an Iowa regiment, in which he served until being discharged for ill health. Bowman was unable to walk as a result of his illness and complications caused by the harsh conditions of his service, and used crutches until he was able to begin walking unaided again in 1874. Post–Civil War After the war Bowman studied law in the firm of George H. Earle, Sr. and Richard P. White (brother and husband of Caroline Earle White), attained admission to the bar, and practiced in Philadelphia. Bowman was active in the Grand Army of the Republic, and served as Judge Advocate of the Department of Pennsylvania. He was also a sought after speech maker, and gave orations for Pennsylvania's Republican Party, Decoration Day commemorations, and other celebrations. On April 18, 1876 Bowman married Elizabeth (Lizzie) W. Malcolm (died October 26, 1929), the daughter of Baptist clergyman Thomas Shields Malcolm. Continued military service In 1877 Bowman joined the 20th Pennsylvania Regiment, which was organized to respond to labor unrest during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. In 1878 he received a commission as a captain in command of Company H, 1st Regiment, Pennsylvania National Guard. He advanced through the ranks and became regimental commander with the rank of colonel in 1887. Spanish–American War Bowman volunteered for the Spanish–American War and his regiment was mustered into federal service in 1898. He was seriously injured during training at Mount Gretna on May 2, 1898, and was unable to lead the regiment when it departed Pennsylvania, so command passed to his lieutenant colonel, J. Lewis Good. The war ended before the 1st Pennsylvania departed for Cuba. Bowman resumed command after the regiment returned to Pennsylvania from its encampment in Tennessee. Post-Spanish–American War In 1907 Bowman became commander of Pennsylvania's 1st Brigade as a brigadier general. In 1909 he became commander of the Pennsylvania National Guard Division, the organization later known as the 28th Infantry Division, and was promoted to major general. He served until retiring in 1910, and was succeeded by Charles B. Dougherty. Death and burial Bowman died at his home \\"The Elms\\" in Merion Station, Pennsylvania on April 8, 1928, and was buried at Merion Friends Burial Ground.

It was inaugurated on 11 December 1951 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel by Claude Philippe. He created the group as \\"he felt the city needed a simon-pure, amateur gourmet society\\". At the black-tie dinners, he functioned as \\"a cross between a benevolent dictator and a kindly father\\". The society was known for its wine stock and for its elaborate dinners, initially only for men, but later including the Ladies Dinner. For $250 per year, a member could attend five lavish dinners, and these dinners were attended by some of the wealthiest and most notable men in the world. The Lucullus Circle dinners brought about a \\"new golden age of gastronomy\\", attracting some of the wealthiest businessmen in the world at the time to feast on some \\"six to eight food courses and two wines with each course\\". The third dinner occurred on 10 March 1952 in honor of the Iranian ambassador. At one dinner guests dined on gold dishes with gold knives and forks, while at another, the room was adorned with objets d'art from important collections. Members came from the arts, business, politics as well as other professions. Many of the members resided at the Waldorf Towers. \\"Lucullans\\" were characterized as the \\"most sensitive and cultivated palates in New York, a sometimes questionable center of civilization and sophistication\\". Numbering approximately 50 gentlemen at a time, the dinner attendees were prohibited from conversing about business, politics, and religion. After the first year, the Lucullus Circle lost only two members, one who died and the other who resigned due to his health. By 1972, however the dinners had begun to lose their appeal. New York Magazine noted that the dinners were still appreciated for their \\"enormous stocks of wine\\". but that it no longer seemed to \\"have the appeal of the other groups\\". They nonetheless continued. After Philippe's death, his wife, Helga, took over planning the gentlemen's dinners, as well as coordinating the wines and greeting the attendees; she was the only woman present at these events.

On June 28, 1965, Clipper Friendship, the Boeing 707-321B operating this route, experienced an uncontained engine failure shortly after take-off, but was successfully able to make an emergency landing at the nearby Travis Air Force Base. This accident was filmed by a passenger. Accident Flight 843, carrying 143 passengers and 10 crew members, took off around 2:00 pm PST on Monday, June 28, 1965. After going through the pre-flight check-list, Captain Charles Kimes, 44, let his co-pilot, Fred Miller, 48, handle the take-off. As the aircraft climbed to an altitude of approximately 800 feet, the number 4 (outer-right) engine exploded, rupturing the right outboard fuel tank and igniting the fuel inside. The explosion and resulting fire caused the last 25 or so feet of the right wing, along with the damaged engine, to break off from the rest of the aircraft. Captain Kimes radioed the tower \\"I don't know whether I can keep it in the air or not.\\"http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=384049. Reading Eagle.

During this time, passenger William Richmond and his wife recorded footage of the burning wing with their camera. Finally, about 34 minutes after taking off, and with the landing gear lowered by emergency means,Safety Last, page 42. Flight 843 landed safely at Travis. In the end, all 153 people on board survived unharmed. The success of the landing under the circumstances was described as a \\"miracle\\" by the news press. Investigation Three days before the accident on June 25, the number 4 engine was overhauled and seemed to work perfectly for 39 flight hours. The cause of the explosion was revealed to be a catastrophic failure of the engine's third stage turbine disk, resulting from a loss of operating clearance between the disk and the third stage inner sealing ring. Improper positioning of the turbine rotor, use of the wrong type of tool and worn parts included in the engine assembly process were blamed for that loss of clearance. The CAB accident report states that the inspector on duty during the reinstallation of the turbine rotor \\"signed off on work he had not inspected\\".Safety Last, page 43. Starboard wing damage. Aftermath The number 4 engine ripped through the roof of a cabinet shop in San Bruno. Slashing through a wooden beam, the jet engine then penetrated an 8-inch thick concrete wall, damaging equipment outside, and came to rest on a mound of dirt. A large section of wing came down on Grand Avenue in South San Francisco, starting a grass fire. A 6-foot section of the wing hit the ground in Holy Cross cemetery and a charred chunk of the engine exhaust struck the rear of a housing area, also in South San Francisco. No injuries were reported. While the passengers waited, Pan Am dispatched another 707 to Travis AFB to collect them and continue across the Pacific. This plane's nose gear collapsed on the runway, leaving the passengers dumbstruck. A third aircraft was sent, landing safely. Of the original 143 passengers all but 8 boarded the flight to Hawaii.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-fNahas8Ro.

Background The novel is first in a series of four pastoral novels by Sand, based on her childhood; it was followed by François le Champi (1847–1848), La Petite Fadette (1849), and Les Beaux Messieurs de Bois-Doré (1857).Kristeva 35.  Plot  The Père Maurice is talking to Germain, his 28-year-old young son-in-law, about Germain taking a new wife. Germain has been a widower for two years, and his wife left behind three young children. (Père means Father and is used in ancient oral Language.) Maurice wants Germain to go visit his friend, Père Leonard, at a farm about half a day's ride away, to visit Leonard's daughter, a rich widow who is looking to remarry. Her name is Catherine Guerin and it appears she is a good person. Germain does not really want to remarry, but Maurice tells him that two years is long enough to be in mourning, that he is grateful for Germain having been good to his daughter, and that the children need a mother. He and his wife cannot continue to take care of the three young children, and his son and daughter-in-law are expecting a baby, so will not be able to help. Germain finally agrees. Maurice tells Germain to take a present of game to Leonard and the widow and to leave Saturday, spend the night at the widow's farm, and come back on Sunday. He leaves with his son, Pierre, and Mary, a young and beautiful 16 year old girl who needs to find a job in town. They stopt near the mare au diable and spend the night. Germain and Mary begin to fall in love with each other, but neither shows it. The next morning Germain goes see the widow and leaves his son with Mary. When he come to fetched him, disappointed by the widow, he learns that Mary has fled her employer (who tried to rape her) with Pierre. Germain find them both at the mare au diable and they all go back to the village. Several months passes. They don't talk to each other. They finally talk to each other, find out they're both in love, and marry. Reception and legacy The novel (specifically, its opening scene) is supposed to have been the inspiration for Rosa Bonheur's 1849 painting Ploughing in the Nivernais.D'Anvers 91. Criticism A contrasexual, queer reading of the novel was offered by James Hamilton, who suggested that, rather than see Germain as a projection of a male author, Marie could profitably be regarded as an ego-heroine; according to Hamilton, such a reading offers a better explanation of the title (and its explicit reference to a female element, water) and greater depth for Marie's two suitors.Hamilton 73.

Built in 1850, the house was given to Don Eulalio Villavicencio upon the death of his parents. In 1919, Governor General Francis B. Harrison slept in the house as a guest of Sen. Vicente Ilustre, son-in-law of Doña Gliceria, to inaugurate the electric plant in Taal. History In 1850, the parents of Don Eulalio Villavicencio, from their 1820s home behind the Casa Tribunal (now the Municipal Building), decided to build a new house with no adjoining neighbors. The new house stood to what is now the G. Marella Street corner Del Castillo. The house later went to Don Eulalio upon the death of his parents who moved to the older but larger dwelling to accommodate his large family. In January 1892, upon the visit of Juan and Antonio Luna to raise fund for the Propaganda Movement, the couple donated a sum of P18,000. In gratitude, Juan Luna gifted the couple with portraits. In 1896, Eulalio was arrested for illegal complicity in the Katipunan and was imprisoned for two years in Fort Santiago. Eulalio died shortly after his release due to the privation suffered during his incarceration. Because of the death of her husband, Doña Gliceria, became a more rabid nationalist to the extent of holding clandestine meetings in the house with revolutionary leaders of Batangas. She also organized the Batalyong Maluya to fight the Spaniards. With her considerable resources, Doña Gliceria provided food and arms to the revolutionaries. She also generously donated Bulusan, one her stem ships, to the newly proclaimed Malolos Republic. Converted into a war vessel, it became the first ship of the fledgling Philippine Navy. During the Philippine–American War, she actively supported the guerrillas under General Malvar. The Americans kept close watch on her to the extent of posting guards in the adjoining Villavicencio-Marella House. In 1919. Governor General Francis B. Harrison slept in the house as a guest of Se. Vicente Ilustre, son- in-law of Doña Gliceria. to inaugurate he electric plant in Taal, the first town in the Batangas province to have electricity. In anticipation of the visit, black-and-white Machuca tiles were laid in the zaguan. The original painted canvas ceilings of the formal rooms upstairs were removed and replaced with stamped tin imported from the United States. The walls of the caida and the sala we re-stretchered with new canvass and painted with Art Nouveau motifs by Emilio Alvero. The lot along Del Castillo Street was fences with wrought-iron grilles ad landscaped. A fountain featuring a giant clam shell graced the center of the garden. left The house like most dwellings in Taal, survived the Japanese Occupation relatively unscathed, except for the loss of the floorboards of the large comedor or the dining room that ran the whole width of the house. Since the family all lived in Manina after World War II, the house was not lived for almost half a century. Upon partition of the communal property in 1990, the house went to the heirs of Don Sixto Villavicencio, Don Eulalio's son. Edgrado Villavicencio, Don Sixto's only son, inherited the house and began restoring it. When the monument of Doña Gliceria Marella de Villavicencio was erected by the National Historical Institute, the garden was raised to street level and the fountain was buried under the landfill. The covered bridged that used to connect the old house and wedding gift house, which had become dangerously decrepit was demolished. The house is presently owned and managed by Edgardo's son, Ernesto Villacicencio with his wife Maris Rosario Benedicto. right Architecture and style The house typical three-bayed bahay na bato, its ground-floor walls of adobe blocks support an upper story of carved acanthus consoles of molaveseemingy support the windows sills.

The three were inspired to change their band name, Tomato City, to the name of George Harrison's song of the same name.Mercury: An Intimate Biography of Freddie Mercury (Jones 75) With the addition of drummer Rob Tyrrell, the original band featured Gallop on rhythm guitar Dummett on lead guitar and Miline on bass. The group is notable for its next acquisition of singer Freddie Mercury (then known as Freddie Bulsara) who would later join the rock band Smile, who changed their name to Queen. History In 1968, Tomato City was formed and composed of Dummett (lead guitar), Gallop (rhythm guitar),Milne (bass) and future Cure member, Boris Williams (drums). The four did not have a distinct lead singer yet, so Dummett took it upon himself to perform the majority of the vocals in live performances. As Tomato City, the band played locally in the school, mainly classrooms. By 1969, Dummett and Gallop decided to change the group name to Sour Milk Sea. Williams would exit from the band at this point. Milne continued to remain as the bass player and the group added Rob Tyrrell, formally of Genesis forerunner Anon, to the vacant drummer spot. In June 1969, the group became professional, and made their debut at the Guildford City Hall. They supported groups like Deep Purple, Junior's Eyes, and Taste.Mercury: An Intimate Biography of Freddie Mercury (Jones 75 – 76) The group gained a sizeable local following and could have around 100 people come to their performances. Still, the group lacked a true lead singer and frontman. Freddie Mercury, future lead singer of Queen, was looking for a new band after his previous band, Wreckage, broke up. Mercury saw an advert in the Melody Maker simply stating, \\"Vocalist Wanted\\". Mercury would have a successful audition and became lead vocalist of Sour Milk Sea in February 1970. With Mercury as frontman, the band had the habit of performing two to three times a week. Two gigs, one at the Randolph Hotel in Oxford, and another on 21 March 1970 at Highfield Parish Hall, are the most notable. Despite not yet having a cohesive unit, Mercury still managed to keep the audience entertained throughout the Oxford performance. Sour Milk Sea would perform songs written by Freddie Mercury which included \\"Lover\\", \\"Blag\\", and \\"FEWA\\". Along with Mercury's songs, the band also played live covers of songs like Jailhouse Rock and Little Richard's song \\"Lucille\\". Since no known recordings of the band exist, it cannot be determined what other songs the band may have played. The Highfield Parish Hall gig was a charity event just weeks before Mercury would join Brian May and Roger Taylor to form Queen. It is prominent for being the last gig with Mercury and for its write up in the local paper, Oxford Mail. The article includes a biopic of each group member along with the only known photo of the band with Mercury. It also includes lyrics from Mercury's composition, \\"Lover\\". Ultimately, Mercury's drive toward a creative new sound and control of the band would lead to its premature downfall. Mercury and Dummett began living together in Mercury's apartment as close friends. Gallop became worried that Dummett would side with Mercury on the band's musical direction and disbanded the group. The band had been in heated debates ever since Mercury joined just weeks ago. He owned all the equipment so there would be no chance that the group could continue. In April 1970, Freddie Mercury joined the band Smile, which, upon Mercury's insistence, became known as Queen. Aftermath Freddie Mercury would go on with Queen to become one of the most successful and enduring acts in history. Within three years Queen would release their debut album, Queen. Chris Dummett would play one last time with Mercury in a practice session at Imperial Lecture Theatre. These same sessions included future bassist John Deacon and the rest of Queen. The collective of musicians would practice future Queen tracks. Mercury hoped to add a second guitarist, but the session did not pan out and Dummett would no longer be included in the band activities. Mercury and Chris Dummett would not cross paths again until 1987.

It was first broadcast on CCTV-1 on 2 January 2011. It added a heavy dose of supernatural mysticism into the traditional wuxia story.

Liu Xing's father Jin Kai Jia was the last known martial arts master to come up against it being used by Qiu Tian Ming, master of the Phoenix Manor. When unleashed, the weapon killed many curious onlookers who had come to watch the rare occasion of the Kong Que Ling in action. When the young Liu Xing arrived to seek her father at the duel site, she could not find her father amidst all the corpses. About ten years later, in her search for her missing father, Liu Xing joined the mysterious and universally feared Green Dragon Society (青龙会) and rose high in its ranks. The leaders of the Society were shown appearing as 2 Chinese dragons surrounded by thick metal chains in a cave. They ordered Liu Xing to obtain the Kong Que Ling. At the same time, the Society also ordered another of its assassin units led by Ximen Yu (西门玉) to disrupt the northern armed escort agencies from forming an alliance. Deng Ding Hou (邓定侯), the head of one of the agencies, had initiated the proposal in response to the southern armed escort agencies falling to the Green Dragon Society. Ximen Yu hatched a scheme to provoke enmity between Deng Ding Hou and the Phoenix Manor. He ordered Ma Feng (麻峰), one of his subordinates, to pose as Qiu Tian Ming's son, Qiu Feng Wu, to woo Deng Ding Hou's daughter Deng Yu Ru (邓玉如). The plan was to sneak Deng Yu Ru into the Phoenix Manor and murder her, making it look like Qiu Feng Wu had killed Deng Yu Ru after seducing her. Liu Xing was unwittingly fooled into thinking Ma Feng was really Qiu Feng Wu. After her spy who infiltrated the Manor informed her of the Phoenix Manor's tradition of the heir inheriting the Kong Que Ling upon getting married, she secretly murdered Deng Yu Ru and took her place, using a special skill to alter her appearance. Meanwhile, the real Qiu Feng Wu had sneaked out of home to prove himself to his strict father. Assuming the identity of Xiao Wu, a ne'er-do-well and gambler, he crossed paths with Liu Xing in both her identities as herself and as Deng Yu Ru, falling in love with the latter. Infiltrating Ximen Qing's band of assassins, he foiled their plans to cut communication between the northern armed escort agencies. He broke his cover to save a widely respected hero Bai Li Chang Qing (百里长青) who had been invited to spearhead the northern alliance. Fleeing from Ximen Qing, he was aided by another assassin Gao Li (高立), who also respected Bai Li Chang Qing. Liu Xing had also fallen in love with Xiao Wu, but was determined to accomplish her mission and continued to get close to Ma Feng. When she finally realised Ma Feng was not the young scion of the Phoenix Manor, he had fallen for her hard. Her sudden harsh rejection made him bitterly jealous of Xiao Wu. His love turned into hatred as he had also betrayed the Society for her sake and hence had to be on the run forever. Ma Feng soon found his past catching up with him as well when three mysterious people from his native land appeared in pursuit of his magical sword. It was revealed that his home was located in the frozen far north, and his people were known as the Rain Tribe. One of the pursuers was his childhood sweetheart, Hou Jian, who was being groomed to be the next Chief Shaman. She needed the magical sword to complete the ritual to be the Chief Shaman. Ten years before, he had apparently fled with the sword as he did not want Hou Jian to forget him – one of the results of the ritual completion was for the Chief Shaman to forget personal ties.

Four models were produced—in 1723, 1740, 1809 and 1831.Don Troiani History Potzdam, just outside Berlin, had been Frederick the Great of Prussia's favorite place of residence as well as the city where the musket was made, hence the name.Military Heritage While the musket is more correctly called a Prussian infantry musket or a Prussian pattern musket, these muskets later became known as \\"Potzdam muskets\\". After Frederick was crowned in 1740, he ordered the then-current Prussian musket; a version from 1723, for his army. The Potzdam musket had already made a name for itself by being the first standard German-made musket, and the 1740 model further solidified Potzdam as the key arsenal for Germany. The muskets were widely used by the Prussians and soldiers of the various German principalities in the 18th century. British-hired Hessian troops as well as troops from other German principalities in the revolting thirteen British colonies in America also used the muskets against rebels.Middlesex Trading Companie Design features A smoothbored musket, the weapon was reasonably accurate to about 100 yards (91 m) against line infantry. But a musket was preferably used at a much shorter distance than that when discharged en masse. The calibre of the Potzdam Muskets was between 0.71 (18.034mm)Prussian M1809/31 Infantry Musket (a.k.a. Potzdam Musket) and approximately 0.7874 inches (20mm)German Historical Museum—which was larger than most other major nations' military rounds. The barrel length of the Potzdam muskets varied between 34.82677 inches (884.6 mm)German Historical MuseumKronoskaf—Prussian Line Infantry Weapons and 45.82677 inches (1,164 mm) and an overall length between 55.91 inches (1,420 mm)Artax—Prussian 1740 pattern, Frederick the Great musket and 61.61417 inches (1,565 mm),German Historical Museum and weighed less than 9.744433 pounds (4.42 kg)Artax—Prussian 1740 pattern, Frederick the Great musket to 10.75856 pounds (4.88 kg).German Historical Museum The stock of the Potzdam was usually made of walnut. Stress-bearing parts of the Potzdam, such as the barrel, lock plate and firing mechanism were made of steel and sling- swivels made of iron whilst other furniture pieces such as the butt plate, trigger guard and ramrod pipe were found in brass. Besides not having fore- sights, Brown Bess-musket were virtually identical to Potzdam muskets up until 1809. Variants =Model 1723= The Potzdam Infantry Musket Model 1723 was the first standard long-gun of the Prussian Army. It was the rival of the Charleville musket (1717) of France and the Brown Bess-musket (1722) of Great Britain. These were manufactured in .73 calibre—to enable the use of British military bullets.Don Trionani's Soldiers in America 1754–1865 It had pins in order to hold the barrel in place and four pipes which held a steel scouring stick with a trumpet shaped end. As with Swedish military muskets, that also clung to pinned barrels (until pattern 1778),Swedish Army Museum the Potzdam musket had fore-sights made of brass, making the bayonet lug's optimal location under the barrel where an 18.50-inch (470 mm) triangular cross- section bayonet could be fitted – its inner diameter was approximately 0.8543307 inches (21.7 mm). Moreover, could the weapon's fore-sights be used with a crude rear sight in form of an oblong rounded notch in the barrel peg. The Potzdam Infantry Model 1723 for the Guard (German: Infanteriegewehr Modell 1723 für die Garde) had a calibre of around .78 (20mm). The barrel length was 45.82 (1,164 mm) and an overall length of 61.61 (1,565 mm), and weighed 10.75 pounds (4.88 kg). =Model 1723/Model 1740= The 1740 pattern Potzdam Musket, derived from the earlier 1723 pattern, was produced from 1740 to 1760 and used the same standardised parts.Germany at War – 400 Years of Military History The mounts were brass, and the barrel was shortened by 11 inches (279.4 mm).Kronoskaf—Prussian Line Infantry Weapons It was supplied to allied German states during– and after the Seven Years' War, and was also manufactured at Herzberg, Wesel, Schmalkalden and Suhl.Don Trioani's Soldiers of the American RevolutionAmerican Military Shoulder Arms The 1740 model had a 34.82-inch (884.6 mm) barrel and an overall length of 50.61417 inches (1,285.6 mm), and weighed less than 9 pounds (4.5 kg). Though the M1723/M1740 eventually gave way for the Potzdam Infantry Musket Model 1809, it was still in use by Prussian soldiers at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and beyond.Military Heritage =Model 1809= The Model 1809 Prussian Musket, like its predecessor, was assembled at the Potzdam armory during the Napoleonic Wars. It had steel rather than brass barrel bands to reduce costs, and borrowed extensively from the design of the French Charleville Model 1777 Musket. The hammer (or cock) had a decorative heart-shaped cutout, and the steel pan had a protective shield to keep the powder dry in wet weather.Prussian Line Infantry 1792–1815—false Lock of 1809 Musket The pins were abandoned in favour of three barrel bands. Unusually, the fore-sights were cast into the barrel band rather than the end of the barrel.Military Heritage The 1809 model had a 41.25-inch (1,047.75 mm) barrel and an overall length of 56.45 inches (1,433.83 mm), and weighed approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg).Liberty Tree Collectors The calibre was reduced to .71 (18.034mm).Arms2arms The barrels were manufactured separately at Spandau, and were brought to Potzdam for finishing and final assembly.1820 The General Gazetteer; Or the Compendious, Geographical Dictionary At the Battle of Waterloo, the 1809 pattern Potzdam was the most widespread musket in use by Blücher's troops. Due to its large bore, it could fire the cartridges of fallen British and French soldiers, although the smaller French bullets would rattle down the barrel and reduce accuracy and stopping power.Waterloo: The Decisive Victory The socket bayonet of the M1809 musket was patterned after the bayonet of the French Charleville musket. Like most other bayonets of the early 19th century, it had a triangular 19.25-inch (488.95 mm) blade. However, it lacked the mortise normally used to secure the bayonet over the fore-sights of the musket barrel.World of bayonets =Model 1831= From 1831 to 1839, the Prussians manufactured a caplock conversionRichard Holmes—Weapon – a visual history of arms and armour of the 1809 Potzdam musket.Maine Memory Network These were manufactured not only in Potzdam, but also in Danzig.American Rifleman The 1831 musket was replaced with the Dreyse needle gun in 1841, and most of the old muzzleloaders were sold to the Americans for use in their civil war.Prussian M1809/31 Infantry Musket (a.k.a.

Massey was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 for his use of physical biochemistry to relate flavin chemistry to flavin enzymology. Biography =Family life= Massey grew up in a family of fishermen in a small village outside of Berkeley in New South Wales, Australia. Massey became interested in science in high school, to the point of performing home chemistry experiments. He was the first in his family to go to university and he obtained a Bachelor of Science from the University of Sydney in biochemistry in 1947.Vincent Massey. Box 84. News and Information Services. Bentley Historical Library. University of Michigan. He met his wife Margot, a survivor of the Holocaust, while he was working at a government laboratory Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) as a research biochemist. They married during his time there and left for the University of Cambridge in 1950, never returning to Australia. Vincent and his wife had three children. =Academic career= After obtaining a B.S. in biochemistry from the University of Sydney, Massey worked as a research biochemist for the CSIRO. He worked there for three years, and in that time published five papers on the inhibition of the TCA cycle in nematodes by fluoroacetate. The CSIRO awarded him with a fellowship that would allow him to pursue his doctoral degree at the University of Cambridge. Massey did his thesis work with Malcolm Dixon. His thesis project revolved around the enzyme fumarase, which is not a flavoprotein. However, Massey was exposed to flavins in the lab through working with other students. After completing his thesis, he moved to the United States for a summer to work with Robert A. Alberty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Here, he continued studying fumarase and published in 1954 possibly the first thorough paper studying steady-state kinetics of an enzyme as a function of pH. A colleague from Cambridge, Tom Singer, had accepted a position at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and recruited Massey to work with him to investigate the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. Singer had recently discovered that FAD was covalently bound to the enzyme. This started Massey's career on flavins and flavoproteins. In 1957, Massey returned to England to be a lecturer at the University of Sheffield in the Biochemistry Department. By 1961, he was promoted to senior lecturer. In 1963, Massey changed his career path and took a professorship position the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Massey was awarded the Henry Russel Lectureship in 1995, the highest recognition given to faculty members at the University of Michigan. His major scientific contributions include the identification and kinetic characterization of lipoamide dehydrogenase and pioneering the methods of stopped-flow and rapid-freeze electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to study enzyme mechanisms. He published over 400 papers and at least an additional 50 book chapters, symposia or reviews. He also had a significant mentoring role; his students included Charles H. Williams, Rowena G. Matthews and David P. Ballou, among others. Scientific achievements *I.C.I.

Gyeonggi-do). It is an area of Siheung stretching from north to south with low hills under . Oido has shell mounds throughout the whole area, with the largest of the mounds located on the West Coast. The Oido shell mounds are the only remains of the exchanges between the North and South Neolithic cultures of the Korean Peninsula. The mounds also provide information on the Neolithic area's changing coastal environment. History Important events in the history of Oido: *The Prehistoric Age and the Creation of Natural Community. *In 1018, it was reorganized to be Ansan-hyeon (安山縣). *The early years of the Joseon dynasty, called O-jil-ae-do (吾叱耳島), occurred during the reign of King Seongjong (1469-1494) in the Joseon Dynasty. *In 1757, Silla was incorporated into the Janggu-gun. *August 4, 1896 it was reorganized to be Ma-you meon, Ansan-gun and Gyeong-gi. *April 1, 1914 it was incorporated into Jeong-wang- li, Gun-ja-myeon and Si-heong-gun. *In 1940, it was renamed Ansan-gun(安山郡). *May 1, 1985 it was reorganized to be Ansan-gun and Incheon. *January 1, 1989 it was reorganized to be Jeong-wang-dong and Si-heong city. *During the reign of King Jeong-jo in the Joseon Dynasty, it was renamed to Oido the current name. *The Japanese Colonial Era set up a pond in this area so that the mud and salt returned to the land. *Construction of Military Forts. Geography *Oido is not an island on the ocean, but people still refer to it as an “island.\\" *Some parts of the northeast side of the island were occupied by the Japanese. *The Northwest and Southeast parts of Oido have steep rock slopes. Transportation *Oido Station is the last station of Seoul Subway Line 4 and the Suin Line. It is about three minutes on foot from Oido Station. One can also take a bus. Tourist attractions *Dinosaur Egg Fossil Place Visiting Center (공룡알 화석지 방문센터): In 1999, fossil dinosaur eggs were found around Wooeumdo(우음도) in the center of Sihwaho Lake (시화호). They were formed about 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era. More than 200 dinosaur eggs were discovered, and the site was designated Natural Monument No. 414. It is valued for academic research and displays fossil exhibits and dinosaur models. *Oido's Shell Festival promotes the customs and flavors of the Oido people and its fishing village life to tourists. The festival is held on Oido's food culture street every October. Typical events of the festival include catching eels with one's bare hands and shell gathering. Many local dishes of Oido are for sale and it consists of seafood and local specialties. After the Si-heung city stopped funding the festival in 2014, the festival got smaller. Originally, the festival was held for 2 to 3 days but, the last festival lasted only one day and the number of tourists that came decreased from 20000 to 10000. *Ok-gu Park (옥구공원): Ok-gu Island had controlled visitors’ access until 1998 because of the coastguard station. After 1998, Si-heung city made Ok-gu island an Eco-friendly park for families who live in the capital areas. Ok-gu Park opened in 2000 and is composed of ‘Hometown Hill (고향마을)’, ‘Mugunghwa Hill (무궁화 마을)’, Marsh Eco Park (갯벌체험광장) and Lotus Flower Complex (연꽃단지) among other sites. Ok-gu park held the ‘Gyeong-gi gardening culture fair’ in 2010. *Oido Commemorative Park (오이도기념공원) : The park is located at the starting point of Siwha Seawall. There are various attractions including an honorary monument, observatory, tideland education plaza, inline skating rink, bicycle rental and other facilities. *Oido Food Culture Street (오이도음식문화거리) : Gyeong-gi province designated Oido food culture street as a model food culture. The local dishes like sliced raw fish (활어회), noodle soup with clams (바지락칼국수) and roasted clams (조개구이) are popular. *Red Lighthouse (빨간등대).

T. Rama Rao under his Ramakrishna Cine Studios banner. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Nandamuri Balakrishna, Deepa in the lead roles and music composed by C. Ramchandra. The film is based on the Bollywood epic Mughal E Azam. Plot The film is a historical love story, based on Mughal E Azam, with the 16th century Mughal Emperor Akbar. Akbar (N. T. Rama Rao), who does not have a male heir, undertakes a pilgrimage to a shrine to pray that his wife Jodha (Jamuna (actress) give birth to a son. Later, Tansen (Gummadi) the singer in his court, brings the emperor news of his son's birth. Overjoyed at his prayers being answered Akbar gives Tansen his ring and promises to grant him anything he desires. Here, Salim grows as a spoiled-brat, flippant and self-indulgent. So, Akbar sends him off to war, to teach him courage and discipline. After 14 years, Prince Salim (Nandamuri Balakrishna) returns as a distinguished soldier and falls in love with court-dancer Nadira, whom the emperor bestows on her the title Anarkali (Deepa), meaning \\"pomegranate blossom\\". Knowing it, Gulnar (Madhavi), another dancer of a higher rank, envies as she too aspires to possess the prince's love but fails. So, she uncovers their forbidden relationship to the Emperor. At present, Salim pleads his father for acceptance for their espousal, but he refuses and imprisons her. Right now, Salim rebels and amasses an army to confront Akbar to rescue Anarkali. Defeated Salim is sentenced to death by his father but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs to have a few hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes Tansen favor, as it was he who brought him news of Salim's birth. He pleads for her Anarkali's life. The emperor has a change of opinion, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He, therefore, arranges for her secret escape into exile with Tansen but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive. Cast *N. T.

Possibly the worst serial killer in Australian history, Lynch was a bushranger who murdered and robbed cattle and laborers in the trails around Berima. Lynch was sentenced to death, and was executed in 1842.  Background  John Lynch was born in 1813 in Cavan, Ireland. In 1830, he was convicted of false pretences in Cavan, and two years later he was sentenced to penal transportation to Australia. Lynch, at 19-years-old, left Ireland on the ship , on 1 July 1832 sailing from Dublin to New South Wales. On 16 October 1832, the ship docked at Port Jackson and Lynch was billeted out to Berrima, a village founded that year and located in the southern highlands of New South Wales, roughly 130 kilometres from Sydney. Lynch was a small but solidly-built man at just 5’3” in height, and worked as a convict labourer on various farms before joining a gang of bushrangers. An 1835 incident saw him and two others convicted for the killing of Tom Smythe, after Smythe had given evidence against Lynch's gang. Despite his admission to the crime the jury did not believe him and set him free, while the other two were hanged.  Murders  Lynch's murder spree started after he went to the farm of T.B. Humphrey, where he had previously worked, and stole eight cattle before setting out for Sydney, where his intention was to sell them. At Razorback Mountain, he met a man called Ireland along with an Aboriginal boy who were driving a full cattle herd loaded with wheat, bacon and other produce. The cargo was meant to be delivered to Thomas Cowper, who was a stranger to Lynch, and decided it would be more profitable to take Ireland’s load and sell it rather than his initial intention. Early one morning, Ireland asked the boy to help round up the cattle, and once they were away from the camp Lynch crept up behind him and smashed the back of his head with a tomahawk, killing him. Returning to camp while Ireland was making breakfast, Lynch distracted him before crashing the tomahawk into the back of his head, killing him too. Lynch hid both corpses and continued to Sydney to execute his plan with his stolen merchandise. On his way back from Sydney, close to Razorback Mountain, he met a father and son called Frazer, who were driving a cattle herd owned by a Mr Bawten. Lynch fancied this herd and decided he would have to kill the Frazers to get it, accompanying them on their journey. That night, they camped near Cordeaux Flat, and the next morning Lynch killed both men and then buried their bodies. After killing the Frazers, Lynch decided to deal with the Mulligans, who had owed him £30 for stolen goods they had purchased off him. He visited the Mulligan farm and killed the four members of the family before gathering the bodies, built a pyre and set them alight. Lynch claimed to be the new owner of the property, and he bought it off the surviving Mulligans as the family left town without a word to anybody.  Arrest and conviction  On the morning of 19 February 1841, Hugh Tinney was on his way to Sydney with a herd of cattle. After stopping near the Ironstone bridge, which crosses the Wingcarribee River on the edge of Berrima, Tinney noticed a dingo rummaging in the undergrowth trying to get at whatever was hidden there. Tinney chased off the dingo, and a closer inspection revealed the body of a man. The man had received various severe blows to the back of his head by a large blunt instrument, and items on the dead man's body identified him as a local farmhand named Kearns Landregan. Landregan was last seen just two nights previously, having dinner in the company of a farmer calling himself John Dunleavy at the Woolpack Inn in Nattai, close to Berrima and not far from where the body was discovered. The police then called on to a farm which had been home to a family called Mulligan but was now owned by Dunleavy, who maintained that he had bought the farm from the Mulligans for £700. Dunleavy also said that all of the Mulligans had apparently packed up and left town without telling a soul. The barmaid from the Woolpack later identified Dunleavy and Lynch as the same person. With that information and other strong evidence gathered by police on 21 February 1841, Lynch was charged with the murder of Landregan. Lynch's trial began in Berrima courthouse on 21 March 1842 before the chief justice of New South Wales, Sir James Dowling. Despite the evidence presented to the court, Lynch maintained his plea of innocence, but the jury found him guilty in less than an hour. He stuck steadfastly to his story of being innocent, as he went through the appeals process, and it was only after this procedure was exhausted that he confessed to his crimes. Lynch was executed by hanging in Berrima Gaol on 22 April 1842.

Many of these new light rail lines, if built, would run on routes used by Auckland's former tram system. History =Background= Auckland was served by a network of traditional tramcar routes with horse-drawn trams (1884–1902) and electric trams (1902–1956). The original tram network was in length at its fullest extent from the mid 1930s until closures began in 1949. =Initial proposal= In 2015, Steve Hawkins, Auckland Transport's Chief Engineer, said that the bus routes on Symonds Street and Fanshawe Street require as many as 150 buses each. The light rail study is considering replacing the bus routes on Dominion Road, Manukau Road, Mt Eden Road, Symonds Street and Queen St with light rail routes. All of those bus routes replaced routes on Auckland's former tram network. Stuff.co.nz quoted Auckland Transport officials who described how the study was considering the option of building light rail routes with dedicated right of way versus routes where rail vehicles shared the road with other vehicles, as with a traditional streetcar system. Officials projected that the maximum passenger capacity of a true light rail line would be 18,000 passengers per hour, while the maximum capacity of a system where vehicles shared the road with other vehicles would be limited to 12,000 passengers per hour. This compares with a bus on a shared path shifting 2,500 people and a bus on a priority path's 6,000 people an hour. In 2015, then Auckland Mayor Len Brown pointed out that the city's ten-year plan did not include funding for building new light rail routes. An eastward line from the airport to Botany Downs has also been proposed with a new interchange at Puhinui railway station, planned to be built in two stages, the first of which is said to be an early deliverable component of the Airport to Botany rapid transit line, planned to be operational by end of 2020 /early 2021. This encompasses a new at-grade bus/rail interchange and enhanced station. Buses will still use the existing local road (Bridge Street) to cross the railway line to/from Manukau, along with local traffic.The second phase provides a rapid transit overbridge across the railway line to provide a more direct and bespoke rapid transit connection. The new rapid transit link will integrate with the new interchange station on the overbridge. The first stage is estimated to cost $59 million to construct. The line will also go through Manukau railway station before ending in Botany.https://at.govt.nz/projects-roadworks/airport-to-botany-rapid- transit/ =Detailed planning and funding= On 26 April 2018, Mayor Phil Goff and Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced the Auckland Transport Alignment Project 2018 with $NZ28 billion of investment in Auckland transport infrastructure over ten years, including the fast-tracking of light rail to Auckland International Airport. On 9 May 2018, in a pre-Budget announcement, Twyford and Finance Minister Grant Robertson made the surprise announcement that work on two routes would commence immediately, with an open-tender process for funding, construction, and operation of the lines: * A line from Wynyard Quarter along Queen Street with one route to Auckland Airport via Dominion Road. * A second line, also travelling along Queen Street, then via Karangahape Road and Great North Road to Westgate via a Northwestern Motorway dedicated light-rail corridor, with extensions indicated to Kumeu and Huapai, running past the currently disused Kumeu and Huapai railway stations on the North Auckland Line. Passenger services on the Western Line do not currently operate north of Swanson and do not serve these stations. In May 2018, it was announced that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund had expressed an interest in financing, designing, building and operating Auckland's light rail network, in a consortium with CDPQ Infra, a Canadian infrastructure company. The consortium was named NZ Infra. By early 2019, the cost of the two lines had been estimated at $6 billion, with an underground alignment through Queen St under consideration. = Replacement light metro proposal = In August 2019, Mayor Phil Goff announced that work on the light rail network may begin the following year. The same month, two delivery partners for the project were shortlisted; NZ Infra and NZTA, but it was stated that a 2020 start date would be unlikely. By late 2019, two different types of technology were being considered by the New Zealand Ministry of Transport. The original proposal from the New Zealand Transport Agency consisted of surface level light rail; the other from NZ Super Fund explored fully grade-separated, driverless light metro technology, with an underground alignment through Queen St and elevated sections elsewhere, with fewer stations between the city centre and airport. In May 2020, it was reported that the light rail project had been placed on hold due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. In June, Twyford confirmed that the Ministry of Transport was still committed to the project, but as a fully grade-separated light metro line between the city and airport; stating that \\"Our policy is that light metro is the form of rapid transit that Auckland needs. We've decided very clearly that we need a rapid transit system that's not competing with pedestrians and other cars in the road corridor. A light metro system just like you see in London, New York, Tokyo, Paris, is actually faster and more efficient. It would allow you to get from Queen St to the Airport in 30 minutes as opposed to the 47 minutes that was projected for the old streetcar model Auckland Transport developed.\\" The Ministry did not release the updated cost of the new light metro proposal, or any time frame for its construction. However industry commentators have estimated the decision to use the metro mode will increase cost of the two lines from $6 billion to more than $20 billion, with a new design and construction period of 8 to 10 years beginning from 2021 at the earliest.

He is the namesake of Portland's Terwilliger Boulevard and Terwilliger School. Early life Terwilliger was born in 1809 to parents Cornelius and Annette Terwilliger. He was raised in Ulster County, New York, and became a blacksmith, opening a shop in 1832 at Towanda, Pennsylvania. He continued his trade in Ithaca, New York, and married Sophronia Ann Hurd. Then in 1839 he became a farmer in Ohio, then moved to Illinois and eventually to Michigan. He returned to Illinois and sold his property in preparation for an overland journey to the Oregon Country in 1844. Terwilliger joined a 100-wagon train under the leadership of Sam Parker, John Stewart, and Abner Hackleman. His property included five yoke of oxen, two wagons, and thirteen cows. Most of the company took the Meek Cutoff, and many travelers along that route died of camp fever, including Sophronia Terwilliger. Arrival in Portland Terwilliger arrived in the Portland area in 1845. That same year, the settlement was named by early residents Asa Lovejoy and Francis Pettygrove. Filing a provisional land claim of 640 acres in what later became southeast Portland, Terwilliger began farming.Terwilliger would own three provisional land claims in the 1840s, prior to the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850. His first claim was filed April 11, 1846, two miles from the east side of the Willamette River, with neighbors Baker and Murray to the south and Knox and Enyart to the north, see The legality of a provisional land claim is discussed in Gaston, pg. 358, where the claim was not based on a legal title underwritten by either the United States Government nor the government of England. Nonetheless, titles were written, sold, and traded as real property even when Portland was known informally as \\"The Clearing.\\" In 1845 or 1846 he purchased a lot at what is now SW First Avenue and Morrison StreetMacColl cites First and Yamhill and built a cabin with a blacksmith shop. Soon thereafter, Terwilliger purchased a Donation Land Claim in southwest Portland in the area of Terwilliger Boulevard. Later life =Second marriage= In 1847 Terwilliger married Philinda Green. =Gold Rush= He joined the California Gold Rush in 1848, returning in 1849 with a small amount of gold dust. =Caruthers Cemetery= In 1854 Terwilliger and his neighbor, Finice Caruthers, each donated five acres to the City of Portland for a cemetery. Known as either the Caruthers Cemetery or the Old Cemetery, the location was bounded by SW Abernethy, SW Macadam, SW Bancroft, and SW Corbett.For a discussion of early Portland cemeteries, see =Schools= Three of the Terwilliger children (John, Lorenzo, and Charlotte) attended classes taught by Ralph Wilcox at Portland's first school in 1847. Terwilliger joined others in calling for a school closer to his property near the Macadamized Road, and the Stephens School was erected in 1868.Macadam Avenue was known as the Macadamized Road. A school designed by Floyd Naramore and named for Terwilliger opened at 6318 SW Corbett Avenue in 1916. Terwilliger Parkway In 1909 the heirs of James Terwilliger deeded property to the City of Portland for construction of a parkway through what was left of Terwilliger's Donation Land Claim. The parkway includes other deeded lands, and runs over three miles from Duniway Park to SW Barbur Boulevard; it was identified for this use in the 1903 Olmsted Portland park plan.

Designed in 1839 by Christian Daniel Rauch and unveiled in 1851, it influenced other monuments. After having been encased in cement for protection during World War II, the statue and its base were removed by the East Germans in 1950 and re-erected in 1963 at Sanssouci in Potsdam, but returned to Unter den Linden in 1980. After German reunification the monument was moved back to its original location and restored. It is a registered monument of the City of Berlin. Description and location The monument is tall, the mounted statue itself being high on an unusually tall pedestal, with two bands of sculpture above inscriptions: the middle depicts 74 great men of Frederick the Great's time in life size, many in full relief, and the upper section, reliefs of the king's life, with the four cardinal virtues at the corners. The statue itself depicts Frederick in military uniform and an ermine-trimmed cloak, wearing his decorations, and with his characteristic bicorne hat; he holds the reins in his left hand and in his right has a walking stick.\\"Denkmal König Friedrich II. von Preußen\\", Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt, Berlin, revised 10 April 2014 The statue stands at the east end of Unter den Linden, facing east at the west end of the former Forum Fridericianum (now Bebelplatz) towards the site of the royal palace.Hartwig Schmidt, \\"Architecture and Urban Planning 1850-1914\\", Berlin/New York: Like and Unlike: Essays on Architecture and Art from 1870 to the Present, ed.

History Unter den Linden in 1991, the statue replaced a little east of its original position Frederick William III commissioned the monument from Christian Daniel Rauch in 1839. It was cast beginning in 1845 by Karl Ludwig Friebel, whom Rauch brought from Lauchhammer for the purpose; changes to the figures on the base extended work to six years,Wolfgang Vomm, Reiterstandbilder des 19. und fruhen 20. Jahrhunderts in Deutschland: zum Verständnis und zur Pflege eines traditionellen herrscherlichen Denkmaltyps im Historismus, dissertation, University of Cologne, 1979, 2 vols.

Mai 1851, Berlin: Decker, 1851 . It is one of Rauch's best known works, and influenced other monuments erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During World War II, the monument was encased in concrete for protection. In May 1950, the East German Magistrat decided to remove it to the park at the palace of Sanssouci in Potsdam. Metal thieves damaged it after the protective casing was removed, and it was dismantled and taken away between 13 and 19 July.\\"Das Denkmal Friedrichs des Großen\\", in Das Berliner Schloss und sein Untergang.

In the 1980s, the East German government changed its politics of memory and especially its position on the Prussian heritage. In 1980 Erich Honecker called Frederick \\"the Great\\" in an interview with Robert Maxwell; in the same year, the historian Ingrid Mittenzwei published a relatively positive biography of the king.Ingrid Mittenzwei, Friedrich II. von Preußen.

The preparations to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the founding of Berlin in 1987 led to further reconsideration of the Prussian heritage; that year Gisela May performed a song celebrating the statue's return.Nashenka, \\"'Der Alte Fritz', Gisela May\\", Politiek en Cultuur blog, 19 July 2010 . After German reunification, the Senate of Berlin had the monument scientifically restored\\"Restaurierung des Bronzestandbildes Friedrich II. wurde fachtechnisch einwandfrei ausgeführt\\", press release, City of Berlin, 14 June 2001 and it was replaced in its original position, with the wrought-iron fence and 19th-century lamp posts recreated.

Other statues of Frederick the Great Johann Gottfried Schadow, who was Rauch's teacher and had received many commissions under the previous king, Frederick William II, had expected to carry out this commission. Already in 1821-22 he had made a lifesize bronze of Frederick the Great with two greyhounds, which is at Sanssouci.Georg Sello, Potsdam und Sans-Souci: Forschungen und Quellen zur Geschichte von Burg, Stadt und Park, Breslau: Schottlaender, 1888, , p. 133 Gisold Lammel, Kunst im Aufbruch: Malerei, Graphik und Plastik zur Zeit Goethes, Stuttgart: Metzler, 1998, , p. 502 . He also created a marble statue of Frederick for the city of Stettin, now lost, a bronze reproduction of which is now in the grounds outside the New Wing at Charlottenburg Palace.Friedrich Benninghoven, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Iselin Gundermann, Friedrich der Grosse: Ausstellung des Geheimen Staatsarchivs Preussischer Kulturbesitz anlässlich des 200.

Another smaller copy of Rauch's statue was made to commemorate Frederick's overnight stay in the Dehlitz section of Lützen before the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, and stood in a park there from 1858 until World War II, when it was moved for safekeeping to Lützen Castle.\\"Gutspark Dehlen\\", Ausflüge in Lützen und Umgebung, Town of Lützen, retrieved 28 January 2015 .

It can be distinguished by its distinctive labellum which is attractive to species of male thynnid wasps.Caladenia barbarossa side view Description Caladenia barbarossa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide. In spring it produces one, rarely two flowers on the end of a stalk tall, each flower long and wide. The flowers are cream coloured to greenish-yellow with red markings. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, about wide. The lateral sepals spread apart below the flower and are long, wide. The petals also spread widely, are slightly shorter and narrower than the sepals and have their tips rolled inwards. The labellum resembles the body of a wingless female thynnid wasp and is stiffly hinged to the column. The labellum has a dummy insect abdomen, long, wide and curved with many maroon-coloured hairs and calli. The false head is blackish, about wide with two large, thick calli about long on either side of the \\"head\\". Taxonomy and naming Caladenia barbarossa was first described by Reichenbach in 1871 in Beitrage zur Systematischen Pflanzenkunde, from a specimen collected by James Drummond in 1843, near the Swan River. In a review of the genus Caladenia in 2004, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed a name change to Drakonorchis barbarossa but the change has not been widely adopted. The specific epithet was originally Barbarossa, indicating that the plant was named after Barbarossa, named thus for his red beard also. Distribution and habitat The common dragon orchid is widespread and common, between Bindoon, Ravensthorpe and Esperance in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy or clayey loams in moist situations in a wide range of habitats but especially in Casuarina thickets. Ecology Common dragon orchid is pollinated by male thynnid wasps when they try to copulate with the flower. A male Thynnoides bidens has been photographed on the labellum of a flower of this species. Conservation Caladenia barbarossa is classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

C. Robbins Landon (editor). \\"Preface\\", p. 4 of J. Haydn: Missa Cellensis. Bärenreiter, 1964. refers to two masses by Joseph Haydn: * Cäcilien-Messe (St. Cecilia Mass), Hob. XXII:5, written in 1766, and after the score went lost, recomposed from memory in 1773 * Mariazeller-Messe (Mass for Mariazell), Hob. XXII:8, composed in 1782 Both masses are in C major, and both were written for the Mariazell pilgrimage church in Styria.  Cäcilien-Messe, Hob. XXII:5 (1766; 1773)  The Missa cellensis, Hob. XXII:5, bearing the full title Missa cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae (Zell Mass in honour of the most blessed virgin Mary), also known as Cäcilien-Messe, was composed for Mariazell. After the original 1766 score was lost in a fire, Haydn recomposed the work from memory in 1773, at which time he likely also expanded it.  Mariazeller-Messe, Hob. XXII:8 (1782) The Missa cellensis, Hob. XXII:8, fully Missa cellensis fatta per il Signor Liebe de Kreutzner (Zell Mass made for Sir Liebe of Kreutzner), is Haydn's eighth setting of the Ordinary of the Mass and is often identified by the German name Mariazeller- Messe. It was commissioned by the officer Anton Liebe von Kreutzner on the occasion of his ennoblement. The mass was composed in 1782 for performance in Mariazell. =Structure= Compared to Haydn's late masses, the structure of Hob. XXII:8 is rather traditional: fugues at the ends of the Gloria, Credo and Agnus Dei, solo passages in the Gloria and Credo, and a solistic Benedictus. On the other hand, Haydn included many innovations, such as the slow symphonic introduction at the beginning of the Kyrie, where the setting is built on the low voices of the choir and orchestra. The fugues are very rhythmic and syncopated, the solo passages appear very theatrical. This Mass may therefore be considered a link between Haydn's early and late masses.

Transformation scenes were already standard in the European theatrical tradition with the masques of the 17th century. They may rely on both stage machinery and lighting effects for their dramatic impact. In the Early Modern masque The masques of Inigo Jones and Ben Jonson settled into a form that had an antimasque preceding a courtly display, the two parts being linked by a transformation scene. The scene is an abstract representation of the royal power of bringing harmony. Comus, the masque written by the poet John Milton, implies a transformation scene heralded by the arrival of the character Sabrina. British pantomime Change by theatrical means has been seen as central to the pantomime of the Victorian period. After a long evolution, a transformation scene then became standard at the end of Act 1 or beginning of Act 2 of a pantomime. The convention in the middle of the 19th century was of a long transformation scene, of up to 15 minutes. In the later 18th century, genres including the harlequinade and masque ended with a transformation scene to a temple, drawing to a close with the suggestion of harmony restored. John Rich, earlier in the century, made Harlequin with his slap stick able to transform stage props; and later Joseph Grimaldi as Clown was in charge of transformations. Early pantomime related to and contained the traditional harlequinade by means of a transition in which a group of characters descended from the traditional types from the commedia del arte were transformed and \\"revealed\\" as being the key characters in the pantomime of the fairy tale that followed. A production in 1781 of Robinson Crusoe by Richard Brinsley Sheridan is credited with breaking down the rigid separation implied by the transformation, leading to the 19th century view of pantomime. A transformation scene parody, in a British political cartoon from 1864 The dominance of transformation scenes as spectacular ends in themselves has been attributed to the work of William Roxby Beverly, from 1849. By the 1860s, Beverly's work as a scene painter displaced the costume change bringing in the harlequinade in some productions. The extravaganza became differentiated from the pantomime by, among other things, the centrality of a \\"magical transformation scene\\" and the diminishing of the harlequinade clowning. Some British and American Victorian burlesques also retained a transformation scene. Realms of Bliss In the later Victorian pantomime, and before the era of the pantomime dame initiated by Dan Leno, a transformation scene revealing Fairyland was the stock ending. As described by Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald, by a slow process a well-lit landscape appears (the \\"Realms of Bliss\\"). And in it, fairies are seen, rising from the ground, or hanging in the air. In The Adventures of Philip by William Makepeace Thackeray from the early 1860s, \\"The Realms of Bliss\\" is the title of the final chapter, and Thackeray can assume his readers were familiar with the penultimate \\"dark scene\\" that precedes it, the entrance of the Good Fairy, and the ultimate wedding of Harlequin and Columbine. An 1886 musical version of Alice in Wonderland, classed as an extravaganza, revealed the Realms of Bliss at the start, darkening only at the end when Alice awakes. Peter Pan is embedded in the pantomime tradition, and in its original stage production of 1904, Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, ended with a magical transformation scene, returning to Neverland.

Initially knows as St. Andrews's Kirk, it was a Church of Scotland church till 1959 when it became part of the Karnataka Central Diocese of the Church of South India. The church is named after Saint Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. St Andrew's Church celebrated its 150 years anniversary on 20 November 2014. The church was consecrated in memory of Mary Elizabeth McGoun (died 1867), wife of Col. Thomas McGoun of the 6th Madras Native Infantry (died 19 April 1868 at Marseilles on the way back to Scotland, has a memorial stone at the St. Andrew's Kirk, Madras), it was once known as the martyr's church. The monument to the memory of Mary Elizabeth is located at the end of the church altar. History St. Andrew's (Presbyterian) Church at Bangalore, Madras Presidency - Illustrated London News (1866) The foundation stone for the kirk was laid by Lady Grant, (wife of Lieutenant-General Sir. Hope Grant, the then Quartermaster-General of Her Majesty's Forces in the British Madras Presidency), on 22 November 1864. The church was completed and opened for service on 18 November 1866. The cost of constriction (including the land) was Sterling Pounds 4,500 (INR 45,000), the cost covered by private subscriptions and government grant. The sermon of church dedication was given by Rev. Stewart Wright, Church of Scotland chaplain in the Madras Presidency. Rev. Wright was also the presbyter in charge of the new St. Andrew's Kirk. The Illustrated London News reported the inauguration in 1866, with credits given to R C Dobbs, Executive Engineer of Mysore and Major Sankey, chief Engineer of Mysore When the St. Mark's Cathedral was damaged by fire on 17 February 1923, St. Andrew's provided its church for the St. Mark's congregation to worship, till St. Mark's was repaired and reopened in 1927. The early congregation consisted of Scottish officers and men of the British Madras Army, and civilians of Scottish origin. Native Indians were also allowed to occupy the back pews. As a result of the declining Scottish members, in order to attract more people to the church, Kannada services were started in 1965. Architecture St. Andrew's Kirk, Bangalore (1867) Plan of the St. Andrew's Kirk, Bangalore (1867) The church building has the Gothic structure, with a height of 43 ft., length of 105 ft., and width of 57 ft. Stained glass covers all the windows and the large gable. The pulpit is made of teak wood, and is richly carved, in sync with the church architecture. Inside View, St. Andrew's Church, Bangalore (2004) The brick coloured, pure gothic structure was designed by R C Dobbs and Major Sankey. St Andrew's Kirk was the second church to be designed by Richard Hieram Sankey, (an Irishman from Tipperary), after the Anglican Cathedral of All Saints at Nagpur. Architecturally, St. Andrew's Church has many similarities with the main block of the Central College, Bangalore, with its Gothic style, characterised by steeping roof of Mangalore tiles, a row of decorative ridge- tiles on the top, turreted parapets and gables, iron crested towers, intricately done plaster motifs, railings of cast iron, and pilasters and pavilions rising from the wing. Sankey published as description of St. Andrew's Kirk at Bangalore in the journal, Professional Papers on Indian Engineering. Volume 4, published by the Thomason Civil Engineering College, Roorkee. He describes the Kirk to have commenced divine services in November 1864. The church has a length of 93 ft., width of 57 ft. and consisted of a nave covered by a slated pent roof, and aisles on the sides with Bengal terrace roofing. The church was built to accommodate 500 people. The tower was originally intended to be a steeple has a height of 90 ft., nave to the wall plates under the roof trusses was 34 ft., and the side aisles were 23 ft. Brickwork, plastering and chunam (lime) was used in the construction. Ample ventilation and light was made possible by including clerestory windows of the nave, and main and circular windows on the side aisles. There was no transept to break the voice and the acoustics were excellent. The cost of construction was BINR 40,000, with this cost including the furniture and fittings. Half of this cost was raised by public subscription, and the other half met by the Government of Madras. Excluding the furniture and fittings, the cost of construction was BINR 5 per ft2. Stained glass Stained Glass, St. Andrew's There is a 25 ft. stained glass above the altar, fusing 15 panels into one, created by Scottish artist Alex Ballantine and his assistant Gardiner, in order to commemorate the diamond jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria in 1897. At the base, the Old Testament characters of Abraham, Moses, King David and Prophet Isaiah are painted. The top the apostles of Christ - St. Andrew, St Peter, St Paul and St John are painted. Above this, there is the burning bush which is the symbol of the Church of kirk, alpha symbol on the right and omega symbol on the right (signifying beginning and the end). On the very top is painted Jesus Christ. In the late 1970s, the stained glass started sagging backwards, and had to be supported by iron beams from behind.

The Bishop of Bangalore approached the Bishop of Madras, who sent well known architect Joseph Durairaj to study the damage. Other structural engineers had deemed the clock tower to be unsafe and suggested it be brought down. However Durairaj suggested that the tower was safe and could be restored structurally. The bell tower and the portico had been damaged by wear and tear, and exposure to rains, with the foundation sinking and the tower developing an incline. The Bishop constituted a Church Renovation Implementation Committee, taking advise from the professors of Structural Engineering from the Indian Institute of Science. Restoration work was undertaken, and the completed just in time for the church to celebrate its 142 years on 26 November 2006.

In order to commemorate the restoration, on 4 January 2009, eminent organist and music laureate Prof. Dr. Richard Marlow, Director of Music, Trinity College, UK was invited to perform and organ recital, during the re-dedication of the church organ ceremony. St. Andrew's schools =St. Andrew's High School= There existed a St. Andrew's High School, as per the Report on Public Instruction in Mysore, for the Year 1877–78, and other records. In November 1877, the St. Andrew's High School had 20 students in both senior and junior Matriculation Classes(p. 61), with 12 in High School(p. 130) and 4 boarders(p. 179). being managed by the Church of Scotland. Further, records of the Madras Government indicate that in 1871, 1 student of the St. Andrew's High School, Bangalore, passed the Madras Matriculation Exam with a second class. Reports of the Mysore Government dated 1868 also mention the St. Andrew's School, Bangalore. There is no information on when the school was closed or renamed. =St. Andrew's Girls' School= The St. Andrew's Girls' School was started in January 1878, and was managed by Miss. Millard. The reason for opening this school was the closing of the Wesleyan English Girls' School being closed as a result of the building being converted to an orphanage for girls affected by the great famine (p. 107). There is no information on when the St. Andrew's Girls' School was closed or renamed. =St. Andrew's Free School= In 1897, a primary school called the St. Andrew's Free School, was started at Thimmiah Road, Bangalore Cantonment. The school was meant for the poorer sections of society and when it started, there were 50 children from poor families, who received free education, uniform and mid-day meal. However, the school had to be closed due to poor response. According to the records of the Mysore Residency (1880-1947), in 1928, land was acquired for the extension of the St. Andrew's Free School (p. 125), metal work training was started at the school in 1930 (p. 135), the school building was extended in 1931 (p. 137), the school inspected in 1940 (p. 236). In 1944, the building of the St. Andrew's Free School was leased out to the Municipal Commission of the Bangalore Civil and Military Station (p. 298) The school changed hands to the Corporation in 1944, and was renamed as the Government Urdu Higher Primary School (date unsure). It still stands at Black Palli, Shivaji Nagar. The plaque which reads St Andrews Free School, January 1897 still exists, and so do the buildings and school campus. According to the school head mistress Haneefunissa (who was a student of the school at around 1962), the school once had about 800 students, which has now dropped down to 60. Getting the children to school is a major effort, with ayahs being sent to round them up and bring them to school. No information is available on when the lease lapses and when the property will revert to the St. Andrew's Church. =St. Andrew's Primary School, Siddapura= In 1977, the church, re-established the St. Andrews's Primary School at the Siddapura Slum, for the benefit of under-privileged children. The children from poor families are given free uniforms, and free education. Vintage gallery A Tucks Post card, published in 1930, could not be unfortunately displayed here, due to licensing issues.

The house was the wedding gift present of Don Eulalio Villavicencio to his wife Doña Gliceria Marella y Legaspi on the occasion of their wedding in 1871. History =Early years= The house was built in 1870 and was presented to Doña Gliceria Marella y Legaspi on the occasion of their marriage in 1871. Hence it came to be called The Wedding Gift House.The couple lived in the house until the death of Don Eulalio's parents who left him the adjoining house. Since it was bigger, the couple moved over the older house to accommodate their growing family. The Wedding Gift House then served as a guest house. The Luna brothers stayed there in January 1892 while soliciting contributions throughout Batangas for the Propaganda Movement. The Villavicencio couple donated P18,000 to the cause. In gratitude, Juan Luna gifted the couple with their portraits, which were subsequently framed in beautifully carved and gilded frames by Isabelo Tampinco. The house later went to Don Jose Villavicencio, Don Eulalio's son. He lived in the house along with his wife until his demised in the 1980s. The house was later occupied by one of his wards who converted it into apartments. For a while the house became a toy factory. =Later years and restoration= Although the house was lived in by Don Jose Villacicencio, Doña Gliceria's son, until his death in the 1980s, no major repair were done on the house during his occupancy, except for the time of his death; the original hand painted canvas walls had fade by then, with any traces of the original paintings. When the rooms of the house was converted into apartments after his death, the house became derelict. Leaks in the roof had rotten some of the floorboards and many post had sunk due to wood rot. The dining-room floor had sagged so dangerously at one end that the room could not be used. By 1990, the house had fallen into disrepair and only half of it was habitable. In the communal partition the house went to the heirs of Doña Vicenta Villavicencio de Villacicencio, Glirecia's eldest daughter. Monserrat Villavicencio Joven, Vicenta's eldest child, inherited the house. It was only then the house was restored by Jocelyn Villavicencio Joven, daughter of Monserrat Villavicencio Joven, along with her husband Adviculo Cuay Quiblat. The sagging and leaking roof was repaired, the post were jacked up and reinforced, and the rotten floorboards replaced. With the help of Martin I. Tinio Jr., the walls of the upper floor were painted in the style of the 1870s, using colors typical of that period. The garden was landscaped with plants mentioned in the third edition of Fr. Blanco's book Flora de Filipinas. A gazebo in the 1890s style was built in the garden. The process took six years, and house is now a delight to see. Architecture and style The house is a three-bayed bahay na bato. The walls of the entire house, including the second floor except front, are built of adobe blocks. A wooden volada on the second floor fronting the street is walled with carved molave panels and wall- to-wall sliding capiz windows topped by multi-lobed exterior transoms, also of capiz. Above the upper window sill are decorative slats, where Japanese lanterns were hung during processions. Ventanilla or \\"little windows\\" beneath the window sill are faced with iron grillwork wrought in the palmette motif with cast-lead ornamentation typical of the 1870s. The neo-Gothic ogee arches are carved on the main double doors replicated those in the older Villavicencio House. The house is unusual because the town main double doors of the zaguan are built on either side of the a central bay sporting a large decorative wrought-iron grills with a palmatte motif decorated with cast-lead ornaments. The left door led to that part of the zaguan where the carriage was kept when not in use. A door on the left opened to the central garden with a tone stairway at the end leading up to the azotea. The caballeriza or stable was located under the azotea. The left zaguan door also serve as a tradesman's entrance to the large and spacious concerns of the Villavicencios. French doors on the street side let light in, while sliding capiz windows on the either side of the entresuelo ensured good cross-ventilation.

An SLP L is said to compute a group element g ∈ G if g ∈ L, where g is encoded by a word in S and its inverses. Intuitively, an SLP computing some g ∈ G is an efficient way of storing g as a group word over S; observe that if g is constructed in i steps, the word length of g may be exponential in i, but the length of the corresponding SLP is linear in i. This has important applications in computational group theory, by using SLPs to efficiently encode group elements as words over a given generating set. Straight-line programs were introduced by Babai and Szemerédi in 1984Babai, László, and Endre Szemerédi. \\"On the complexity of matrix group problems I.\\" Foundations of Computer Science, 1984. 25th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science. IEEE, 1984 as a tool for studying the computational complexity of certain matrix group properties. Babai and Szemerédi prove that every element of a finite group G has an SLP of length O(log2G) in every generating set. An efficient solution to the constructive membership problem is crucial to many group-theoretic algorithms. It can be stated in terms of SLPs as follows. Given a finite group G = ⟨S⟩ and g ∈ G, find a straight-line program computing g over S. The constructive membership problem is often studied in the setting of black box groups. The elements are encoded by bit strings of a fixed length. Three oracles are provided for the group-theoretic functions of multiplication, inversion, and checking for equality with the identity. A black box algorithm is one which uses only these oracles. Hence, straight-line programs for black box groups are black box algorithms. Explicit straight-line programs are given for a wealth of finite simple groups in the online ATLAS of Finite Groups. Definition =Informal Definition= Let G be a finite group and let S be a subset of G. A sequence L = (g1,…,gm) of elements of G is a straight-line program over S if each gi can be obtained by one of the following three rules: # gi ∈ S # gi = gj \\\\cdot gk for some j,k < i # gi = g for some j < i. The straight-line cost c(gS) of an element g ∈ G is the length of a shortest straight-line program over S computing g. The cost is infinite if g is not in the subgroup generated by S. A straight-line program is similar to a derivation in predicate logic. The elements of S correspond to axioms and the group operations correspond to the rules of inference. =Formal definition= Let G be a finite group and let S be a subset of G. A straight-line program of length m over S computing some g ∈ G is a sequence of expressions (w1,…,wm) such that for each i, wi is a symbol for some element of S, or wi = (wj,-1) for some j < i, or wi = (wj,wk) for some j,k < i, such that wm takes upon the value g when evaluated in G in the obvious manner. The original definition appearing in Ákos Seress. (2003). Permutation Group Algorithms. [Online]. Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics. (No. 152). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. requires that G =⟨S⟩. The definition presented above is a common generalisation of this. From a computational perspective, the formal definition of a straight-line program has some advantages. Firstly, a sequence of abstract expressions requires less memory than terms over the generating set. Secondly, it allows straight-line programs to be constructed in one representation of G and evaluated in another. This is an important feature of some algorithms. Examples The dihedral group D12 is the group of symmetries of a hexagon. It can be generated by a 60 degree rotation ρ and one reflection λ. The leftmost column of the following is a straight-line program for λρ3: # λ # ρ # ρ2 # ρ3 # λρ3 # λ is a generator. # ρ is a generator. # Second rule: (2).(2) # Second rule: (3).(2) # Second rule: (1).(4) In S6, the group of permutations on six letters, we can take α=(1 2 3 4 5 6) and β=(1 2) as generators. The leftmost column here is an example of a straight-line program to compute (1 2 3)(4 5 6): # α # β # α2 # α2β # α2βα # α2βαβ # α2βαβα2βαβ # (1 2 3 4 5 6) # (1 2) # (1 3 5)(2 4 6) # (1 3 5 2 4 6) # (1 4)(2 5 3 6) # (1 4 2 5 3 6) # (1 2 3)(4 5 6) # α is a generator # β is a generator # Second rule: (1).(1) # Second rule: (3).(2) # Second rule: (4).(1) # Second rule: (5).(2) # Second rule: (6).(6) Applications Short descriptions of finite groups. Straight-line programs can be used to study compression of finite groups via first-order logic. They provide a tool to construct \\"short\\" sentences describing G (i.e. much shorter than G). In more detail, SLPs are used to prove that every finite simple group has a first-order description of length O(logG), and every finite group G has a first-order description of length O(log3G).Nies, A., & Tent, K. (2016). Describing finite groups by short first-order sentences. Israel J.

The online ATLAS of Finite Group Representationshttp://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/ provides abstract straight-line programs for computing generating sets of maximal subgroups for many finite simple groups. Example: The group Sz(32), belonging to the infinite family of Suzuki groups, has rank 2 via generators a and b, where a has order 2, b has order 4, ab has order 5, ab2 has order 25 and abab2ab3 has order 25. The following is a straight-line program that computes a generating set for a maximal subgroup E32\\\\cdotE32\\\\rtimesC31. This straight- line program can be found in the online ATLAS of Finite Group Representations. # a # b # ab # abb # ababb # ababbb # (abb)18 # (abb)−18 # (abb)−18b # (abb)−18b(abb)18 # (ababb)14 # (ababb)−14 # (ababb)−14ababbb # (ababb)−14ababbb(ababb)14 # a is a generator. # b is a generator. # Second rule: (1).(2) # Second rule: (3).(2) # Second rule: (3).(4) # Second rule: (5).(2) # Second rule iterated: (4) multiplied 18 times # Third rule: (7) inverse # Second rule: (8).(2) # Second rule: (9).(7) # Second rule iterated: (5) multiplied 14 times # Third rule: (11) inverse # Second rule: (12).(6) # Second rule: (13).(11) Reachability theorem The reachability theorem states that, given a finite group G generated by S, each g ∈ G has a maximum cost of . This can be understood as a bound on how hard it is to generate a group element from the generators. Here the function lg(x) is an integer- valued version of the logarithm function: for k≥1 let lg(k) = max{r : 2r ≤ k}. The idea of the proof is to construct a set Z = {z1,…,zs} that will work as a new generating set (s will be defined during the process). It is usually larger than S, but any element of G can be expressed as a word of length at most over Z. The set Z is constructed by inductively defining an increasing sequence of sets K(i). Let K(i) = {z1α1*z2α2*…*ziαi : αj ∈ {0,1}}, where zi is the group element added to Z at the i-th step. Let c(i) denote the length of a shortest straight-line program that contains Z(i) = {z1,…,zi}. Let K(0) = {1G} and c(0)=0. We define the set Z recursively: * If K(i)−1K(i) = G, declare s to take upon the value i and stop. * Else, choose some zi+1 ∈ G\\\\K(i)−1K(i) (which is non-empty) that minimises the \\"cost increase\\" c(i+1) − c(i). By this process, Z is defined in a way so that any g ∈ G can be written as an element of K(i)−1K(i), effectively making it easier to generate from Z. We now need to verify the following claim to ensure that the process terminates within lg(G) many steps: The next claim is used to show that the cost of every group element is within the required bound. It takes at most 2i steps to generate g1 ∈ K(i)−1K(i). There is no point in generating the element of maximum length, since it is the identity. Hence steps suffice. To generate g1*g2 ∈ G\\\\K(i)−1K(i), 2i steps are sufficient. We now finish the theorem. Since K(s)−1K(s) = G, any g ∈ G can be written in the form k*k2 with k,k2 ∈ K(s). By Corollary 2, we need at most steps to generate Z(s) = Z, and no more than steps to generate g from Z(s). Therefore .

It was built from 1860s circa to 1950s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1999.  History  This two-storeyed timber residence with attic was constructed by 1879, and possibly dates to the 1860s. It is located in the heart of Spring Hill in inner Brisbane, and is associated with the mid-19th century development of this area as one of the city's earliest dormitory suburbs. Land in Spring Hill, much of it located within the original Brisbane town boundaries, was alienated in the 1850s and 1860s as large suburban allotments. Blocks along the ridge roads which became known as Wickham Terrace and Leichhardt Street, were the first to be taken up, followed by the area between Boundary Street (which formed the old northern limit to Brisbane Town) and Gregory Terrace. Subdivision of these allotments commenced from the 1850s, and Spring Hill, within easy walking distance of Queen Street, rapidly emerged as North Brisbane's first dormitory suburb, with little commercial or industrial base of its own. More affluent residents occupied the larger allotments and houses along the ridges, and the working classes occupied the valleys in between (Hanly's Valley and Spring Hollow). Subdivision accelerated during the 1870s and 1880s, and by 1900 Spring Hill was Brisbane's most densely populated suburb. From the 1860s a row of small shops was established along Leichhardt Street between Fortescue and Rogers Streets, with other shops congregated around the hotels at the intersections of Leichhardt Street with Edward, Wharf and Boundary Streets. In the 1870s and 1880s churches, schools, hospitals, a mechanics' institute and a tram service were established along Leichhardt Street, which became the hub of Spring Hill. Boundary Street, running from the river west to Gregory Terrace, attracted a mainly working class population, including artisans, trades persons and labourers, with middle class residents occupying the higher blocks near Leichhardt Street and Gregory Terrace. Lonsdale House, fronting Boundary Street close to the intersection with Leichhardt Street, was erected on part of Northern Suburban Allotment 97, an area of just under alienated in 1853 by pastoralist David Cannon McConnel, and subdivided the same year. In December 1853 subdivision 16 of NSA 97 () was re-subdivided into two blocks, 283 Boundary Street ( - site of Lonsdale House) and 277 Boundary Street (). An 1856 map of Brisbane shows two structures fronting Boundary Street, between what became Leichhardt and Phillips streets - the westernmost of these may have been located at 283 or 277 Boundary Street, but this is not clear. In 1862 Robert Bourne of Brisbane acquired title to the re-subdivision fronting Boundary Street, and to the adjacent in 1864, by which time he was living in Spring Hill. Whether he erected Lonsdale House after obtaining title to the land, or whether it was already extant, is not known. Nor is it known whether he ever occupied the house. Robert Bourne and his wife Anne Butler were retired missionaries (associated with the London Missionary Society in Tahiti 1817-1827). They had business interests in Sydney and in Victoria in the 1830s and 1840s, and moved to Brisbane following the move there from Sydney in 1851 of their daughter and son-in-law, Harriet and George Raff. Bourne acquired a number of Brisbane properties, including 1a 20p of NSA 97 between Leichhardt and Phillips streets from DC McConnel in February 1856, and portion 192 [1a 3r 36p] on the southern side of Boundary Street in November 1856. He was resident in Leichhardt Street, Spring Hill by 1868, possibly in the two-storeyed brick residence he appears to have erected on the land he purchased from McConnel in 1856, adjoining the northern boundary of Lonsdale House. Bourne was Secretary to the Queensland Board of General Education from June 1860 to January 1870. He died at his home in Leichhardt Street in 1871, aged 78. His death was certified by his son Joseph Bourne of Boundary Street, Brisbane. Following Bourne's death his Spring Hill properties were transferred to executors (sons-in-law George Raff of Brisbane and Stewart Murray of Sydney), and after Anne's death in December 1878, Raff offered the Spring Hill properties for sale by auction in August 1879. By this date, 4 houses had been erected on the property: Lonsdale House (a two-storeyed timber building with verandah and balcony front and back, containing seven rooms, with detached kitchen); a four-roomed timber cottage adjacent ; the two-storeyed brick house behind ; and Strathmore Cottage fronting Boundary Street opposite Lonsdale House. They were located close to the heart of Brisbane, on a rise, with breezes and fine views over the town and river. Lonsdale House on (comprising the original re-subdivision plus extended northern and eastern boundaries) was purchased by Henry Lander Pethebridge for , with title transferred in March 1880. Pethebridge, a carpenter and joiner and government Inspector of Works in the Portmaster's Office, was resident in Brisbane from at least April 1860, when he married Elizabeth Mary Symons. The family lived at various addresses in Spring Hill until the mid-1870s, when they left Brisbane briefly, but had returned by May 1877. Pethebridge was employed in the Department of Harbours, Lighthouses and Pilots, and supervised construction of Cape Bowling Green Lighthouse in the early 1870s. In August 1874 he was appointed Inspector of Works (Class IV) in the Department, a position he held until 1900. The Pethebridges occupied Lonsdale House after their purchase of the property. Mrs Pethebridge died in 1894, but Henry remained at 283 Boundary Street until his death in 1910, after which the property passed to his son, Samuel Augustus Pethebridge of Melbourne, and son-in-law Edward J Atkinson of Brisbane, as trustees. Lonsdale House then was rented out to a series of tenants who used the place as a boarding house. Sir Samuel Augustus Pethebridge died in January 1918, and in August that year, 283 Boundary Street was transferred to Bridget Kenny of Spring Hill. The property changed hands several times in the 1920s, and from was occupied by the Hough family. Herbert Hough obtained title to the property in 1946, ane retained this until 1956. From the 1950s, if not earlier, the house was utilised as a boarding house of 9 rooms, (1 room enclosed on the first floor rear verandah and 1 room in the kitchen wing, in addition to the 7 rooms in the core of the house), and a second ground-level kitchen was constructed at the rear, s. Title was transferred to the present owners in 1966. Lonsdale House is a rare surviving early inner-city residence, and was identified in the Brisbane History Group's 1993 Spring Hill Heritage Tour as a place of cultural heritage interest.  Description  Lonsdale House is located in Boundary Street, Spring Hill, close to the intersection with St Paul's Terrace, on a small elevated block overlooking central Brisbane. It is a two-storeyed timber house with attic rooms, with double-storey verandahs to front (south) and back (north) elevations, and single-storey extensions to the rear. The exterior is clad with 12\\" deep pine chamfer boards. Built on a slope running west–east, the house is partly high-set on timber stumps or replacement concrete stumps. Because of the slope of the land, there are stairs on the western side leading from the street to the \\"ground\\" level front verandah. The main house has a steeply pitched gabled roof covered in galvanised corrugated iron. There are early hipped, concave, corrugated-iron verandah roofs to the upper level verandahs. The single-storey rear extension on the west side has a hipped roof, and the single-storey extension to the east side has a mono-pitch roof, both covered in corrugated galvanised iron. There is a central brick chimney rising above the main roof, and resting on stone foundations. The front verandahs have timber posts with decorative capitals and fretwork brackets. On the lower level the timber balustrade has simple timber dowel in-fill and there is a timber lattice valance. Two of the bays are in-filled with timber lattice privacy screens. The first floor has a cast iron balustrade. The front elevation at ground level has a more recent timber-framed, glass entrance door with fanlight over on the west side, and a pair of 6-over-6 timber vertical sash windows. These have narrow glazing bars with no horn to the top sash, and the glass appears original or early. To the first floor there are three early double casement doors with glazed fanlights over, opening onto the front upper-level verandah. The front gable has a centrally placed 6-over-6 timber vertical sash window, over which is a convex curved corrugated-iron window hood, supported on curved timber brackets with decorative pendants, in-filled with a cross lattice. The east side elevation of the main house has a pair of 6-over-6 timber vertical sash windows to the ground floor and first floor, with the same materials and detailing as those at the front. All have convex corrugated iron window hoods, supported on curved timber brackets with decorative pendants, in-filled with a cross lattice. There are no windows on the west side. The rear elevation of the main house is obscured by the double-storey verandah which is in filled and the two single-story ground-level extensions. The gable has a centrally placed 6-over-6 timber vertical sash window, over which is a hood of the same design as the front and side elevations. The single storey western extension at the rear is rectangular, with a corrugated iron stove recess at the north end, with an iron stove chimney. There is a door in the north elevation and a timber-framed window in the west side elevation. It is clad with 8\\" deep chamferboards and has a galvanised corrugated iron hipped roof. It appears to be of an early date. The rear extension on the east side is elongated with two windows in the east side elevation. It is clad with fibrous-cement sheeting, with a galvanised corrugated iron mono-pitch roof running down to form a valley gutter with the extension on the west side. There is a small lean-to extension at the northern end of this extension, also clad in fibrous-cement sheeting, with a window in the western side wall. There are two lean-to corrugated iron roofs running off these two single-storey extensions at the rear. The rear yard has a corrugated iron roof structure in the north west corner under which is a small, brick WC outbuilding. In the north east corner is a timber-framed carport. The front boundary has a brick wall with brick piers, painted and in-filled with vertical timber picket fencing. Internally, the ground floor has a full-length hall on the west side with a steep timber staircase running up the side wall. The single- flight staircase has four stairs turning onto the first floor landing, and has a turned newel post and simple stick balusters. The hall has a timber arch with decorative brackets separating vestibule from stairwell. The vestibule has a s decorative plaster ceiling; the remainder of the hall (ceiling and walls) is covered in fibrous- cement or ply-wood sheeting with timber battens. Two rooms, one front and one back, open off the hall on the ground floor. The front room has two timber 6 over 6 timber vertical sliding sash windows to the front (south) elevation and 1 to the side elevation. The ceiling is lined in jointed timber boarding with a decorative timber (gas) vent. The walls are lined with ply-wood timber sheeting with battens. The north dividing wall has double and single leaf 4 panel timber doors leading to the room at the rear. The rear room has a single 6:6 timber vertical sliding sash window to the side elevation, and a blocked window to the rear (north) elevation. There is a fireplace with early timber fire surround. The ceiling is lined with timber boarding with central timber decorative (gas) vent. The walls are lined with plywood sheeting with timber battens. A door with fanlight over, leads from the hall out onto the rear verandah, which has been in-filled. On the west side is a small store room, while on the east side the verandah has been incorporated into a later kitchen extension. This extension is lined (walls and ceiling) with what appears to be compressed timber sheeting and has s detailing and fittings. On the west side the single-storey rear extension, an early service wing formerly detached from the main house, has walls and coved ceiling lined with timber tongue and groove boarding with a narrow beading. This wing is divided into two rooms by a wall of vertically jointed tongue and groove timber. Access to the southern room (possibly a former servant's room) is off the verandah. It has timber small-pane sash windows to the east and west side elevations. The rear room (early kitchen) has a corrugated iron stove recess in the rear [north] wall and a door to the rear yard area. A narrow enclosed corridor runs between the two extensions to the rear yard area. The first floor has a generous landing providing access to 3 rooms and the rear verandah, and staircase access to the roof space. To the rear [north] elevation is a blocked window, and a narrow timber 8 panel door leading out onto the enclosed verandah. There are two rooms to the front (south) side of the house and one to the rear. The front room on the west side has a double casement timber and glazed door, with fanlight over, leading out onto the verandah. The doors have a single timber panel to the bottom, and 4 horizontal panes over with a marginal glazing bar detail, and margins in-filled with coloured glass. Walls and ceiling are lined with timber boarding. The front room on the east side has two double casement doors, with fanlights over, leading onto the verandah, of the same design as the adjoining room. There is a 6:6 timber vertical sash window to the side elevation. Walls and ceiling lined with timber boards. The room to the rear has a fireplace with early timber fireplace surround. There is a single 6:6 timber vertical sash window to the side elevation, and a blocked door opening onto the rear the verandah. Walls and ceiling are lined with timber boards. The rear verandah is fully enclosed, and partly extended on the west side. A narrow corridor runs from the landing access door onto the verandah to a window and a fire escape door. On the west side are two small rooms, the first containing a shower and basin, the second a toilet. The enclosed verandah on the east side is lined with ripple iron. It has a window to the east side elevation and rear elevation. Timber decking runs from the fire escape door across the roofs of the single story ground-level extensions. A narrow straight flight of stairs runs from the first floor landing to a small landing in the roof area which is lit by a small skylight. It provides access to two rooms, one to the front (south) side and one to the rear (north) side. The room to the front is lined with wide timber boarding, and has a centrally placed 6 over 6 timber vertical sash window in the gable end. A small access door to the roof space reveals closely spaced battens to the rafters, providing clear evidence that the roof originally had timber shingles. The room to the rear is L-shaped. It has a chimney, but no fireplace, and a single timber sash window to the gable. Walls and ceiling are lined with timber boarding. Floors throughout are of timber.  Heritage listing  Lonsdale House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 August 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Lonsdale House, erected by 1879, provides important surviving evidence of the development of Spring Hill as an early dormitory suburb of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare surviving building of its type (a mid-19th century, 3-level, Georgian-style, detached timber town-house) in Brisbane, and is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of its type, including the town-house form with the entrance set to one side of the house; attic rooms with dormers; wide vestibule and narrow, steep internal staircases; early joinery (French doors, narrow- mullioned windows, simple stick balustrading to the staircases); early exterior decorative detailing; and early, formerly detached, kitchen wing.

It cleaves double-stranded RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, usually requiring a substrate of at least six stacked nucleotides. Like many ribonucleases, the enzyme requires the presence of magnesium ions for activity. Laboratory use Purified RNase V1 is a commonly used reagent in molecular biology experiments. In conjunction with other ribonucleases that cleave single-stranded RNA after specific nucleotides or sequences – such as RNase T1 and RNase I – it can be used to map internal interactions in large RNA molecules with complex secondary structure or to perform footprinting experiments on macromolecular complexes containing RNA. RNase V1 is the only commonly used laboratory RNase that provides positive evidence for the presence of double-stranded helical conformations in target RNA. Because RNase V1 has some activity against RNA that is base-paired but single-stranded, dual susceptibility to both RNase V1 and RNase I at a single site in a target RNA molecule provides evidence of this relatively unusual conformation found in RNA loops.

History  William Grigor and Mary Fenwick Grigor William Grigor's House is a semi-detached stone house, constructed in the late 1860s during the early growth of Spring Hill as a suburb of Brisbane. The house was built for William Grigor, a Scottish immigrant who had arrived in Moreton Bay in 1855. Grigor and his friend and business partner, James Low, acquired the adjoining properties in Gloucester Street in 1867 and proceeded to construct the pair of semi-detached stone houses on the two sites. In 1862 Grigor, Low and William Pettigrew had formed a partnership, and Grigor and Low moved to Mooloolah where they hauled timber and rafted it to Brisbane. In 1863 Grigor married Mary Fenwick and together with the Lows, continued working in the timber industry. By 1868 it would appear that the partnership was experiencing financial difficulties and was possibly dissolved. Low and his family moved to his selection on the banks of the South Maroochy River (later called Yandina). In October 1868 Grigor selected land in the parish of Beerwah, where he commenced construction of Bankfoot House in anticipation of the forthcoming Cobb and Co coach route between Brisbane and Gympie. When Banksfoot House was completed, Grigor was rejoined by his wife, and they established an accommodation house, which was also a post-office, dinner stage and change of horses for Cobb and Co coaches. It is possible that Mary had stayed at the Spring Hill house while Bankfoot House was being built. For over one hundred and twenty years the property in Gloucester Street has remained with the Grigors and their descendants, and has been rented during most of that period. In the 1980s the house was returned to as close to original condition as possible. This included replacement of the verandah fabric and guttering to match existing materials.  Description  William Grigor's House is a cottage made of Brisbane tuff with sandstone dressings, with a two-storeyed brick and stone wing to the rear. Its steeply pitched corrugated iron roof contains an attic storey with a single dormer window, and it has a timber verandah with a corrugated iron skillion roof overlooking Gloucester St. It is one of a pair of cottages which are semi- detached, and sits on an eastward falling slope. The cottage has a simple rectangular plan with four rooms to the ground floor which run off a central corridor, and two rooms above. A timber and corrugated iron room links the cottage to the rear wing, which contains a former kitchen with a single room above. The verandah sits at half level above Gloucester St, and is accessed via stone stairs. It has timber rectangular columns with timber capitals, and an unpainted timber boarded ceiling. The dormer above has a hipped roof, and the half-round guttering is decorated with cresting at the corners. A sandstone and brick chimney rises above the roofline. The windows are multi- paned timber sliding sash windows, and have textured sandstone lintels, quoins and sills; the doors also have textured sandstone surrounds. The eastern attic window is flanked by two timber rails which may have been a lifting device. The rear wing has a hipped corrugated iron roof which adjoins that of its neighbour. A small brick and corrugated iron outhouse sits to the west of the kitchen. The walls and ceilings in the cottage are plaster and lath, with modestly detailed timber trim throughout (much of it cedar). The timber work includes deep window reveals, mantelpieces to the two northern ground floor rooms, a louvred timber door to the north-west room, steep stairs to the attic rooms and cupboards in the eastern attic room. The rear wing contains an early stove, and steep stairs with a shutter door above. William Grigor's House is a rare example of an 1860s inner city residence. The interior is highly intact. The modestly detailed exterior is also intact and contributes to the surrounding turn-of-the-century residential streetscape.  Heritage listing  William Grigor's House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 July 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

He came from a family of merchants of Huguenot ancestry, and was a brilliant student at school in Nîmes. He left without graduating, and spent a few years without a recognised profession, studying and writing and developing an interest in philosophy and Republican political movements. In 1877 Paulhan contributed to the Revue Philosophique of Théodule Ribot. Paulhan became liable for military service when his assigned number was drawn in a lottery, but he was released from serving because of his stutter, which also made it difficult for him to teach. After a political upset in the Nîmes city administration, which favoured Republicans, Paulhan was appointed librarian in 1881. During the years he held this post, Paulhan applied positivist methods to the institution, modernising it. He married Jeanne Thérond in 1884, and that same year their son was born, the future writer and editor Jean Paulhan. Frédéric Paulhan resigned his post in December 1896, affected by political instability in the municipality, and he moved to Paris. Here he continued to write, and he also built up an art collection of etchings, drawings, pastels along with a few paintings, purchased at auction. This collection was sold in 1934. Paulhan entered the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1902, sponsored by Ribot. He was awarded the Prix Jean-Reynaud in 1928. Paulhan was a freethinker, a Dreyfusard and possibly a Freemason; his work has importance in the current of French psychology. Among his books are Les caractères (1894), Les mensonges du caractère (1905), Le mensonge dans l'art (1907) and Le mensonge du monde (1921). Frédéric Paulhan died on 14 March 1931. He is buried in the cemetery at Bagneux under a headstone carved with Masonic symbols.

It was compiled by the Cassini family, mainly César-François Cassini (Cassini III) and his son Jean-Dominique Cassini (Cassini IV) in the 18th century. It was on a scale of one line to 100 toises, i.e. 1/86,400. The map was for the time a real innovation and a decisive technical advance. It is the first map to be based on a geodesic triangulation. Four generations of the Cassini carried out the work. The map does not precisely locate dwellings or the boundaries of swamps and forests, but the level of precision of the road network represented is such that by superimposing satellite photos onto map sheets of France, spectacular results are obtained. The work of the Cassini even left its mark on the land where one still finds today toponyms known as \\"Signal of Cassini \\", which reveal the places where the measurements of the time were carried out. These landmarks correspond to the summits of the innumerable triangles that formed the plot of Cassini's map. Nowadays, researchers frequently consult the Cassini map sheets, ie its paper form in the reading room of the maps and plans department of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, or its digital form online. It is of particular interest to archaeologists, architects, historians, geographers, genealogists, treasure hunters and ecologists who need to retrospect ecology or understand the history of landscape.

Although often described in modern reference works as a contralto, she also sang many soprano roles including Marie in La fille du régiment and Abigaille in Nabucco. She married the tenor Corrado Miraglia in 1857 and retired from the stage in 1862. Her niece, Teresina Brambilla, was also an opera singer.  Life and career  Brambilla was born in Cassano d'Adda, the daughter of Gerolamo and Angela (née Columbo) Brambilla. She was the fourth of five sisters, all of whom became opera singers. Marietta (1807–1875) was a contralto who specialised in travesti roles. Teresa (1813–1895) was a soprano who created the role of Gilda in Rigoletto. Both had very prominent careers. Annetta (1812–?) and Lauretta (1823–1881) were both sopranos who had lesser careers, appearing primarily in provincial Italian opera houses.Cernuschi, Angelo (2013). Brambilla: l'armoniosa famiglia Cassanese. Botalla. . Extracts retrieved 28 January 2015 . The family moved to Milan in 1828, and Giuseppina had hoped to train at the Milan Conservatory where both Marietta and Teresa had gone. However, she was not accepted when she auditioned in 1833 (as one of 28 candidates for 3 places) and consequently studied singing privately. Her first public appearance was in Vienna on 13 May 1839 when she sang with her sister Marietta in a concert celebrating the name day of Prince Metternich. She made her operatic debut in August 1840 at the Teatro Ricciardi in Bergamo, singing the soprano role of Sinaide in Rossini's Mosè in Egitto, a role she repeated in October of that year at the Teatro Grande in Trieste. The following month she appeared there in the contralto role of Maffio Orsini in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia, a role which had been created by her sister Marietta in 1833.Mattera, Angelo (1971).

Later in the season there she created the role of Elisa in Giuseppe Manusardi's Il biricchino di Parigi. She then left for Spain where she was the leading prima donna in multiple productions in Barcelona from November 1841 until January 1845. She then sang for a season in Valencia before returning to Italy by way of Paris and London. She made her London debut in July 1846 at Her Majesty's Theatre reprising the role of Maffio Orsini in Lucrezia Borgia. Her Paris debut followed in October of that year when she appeared at the Théâtre- Italien as Abigaille in Nabucco.Le Ménestrel (1 November 1846). \\"Théâtre Italien', p. 2 On her return to Italy she sang in several provincial theatres before accepting a contract as the prima donna with the Italian opera company at the City Theatre in Odessa, where she was particularly popular and appeared in multiple leading soprano roles from 1850 through 1851.Makolkin, Anna (2004).

She returned to Jassy in the 1855 season to appear in four more operas, including Il trovatore where she sang the role of Leonora with the Italian tenor Corrado Miraglia as Manrico. She married Miraglia in 1857 and retired from the stage five years later. Her last performances were at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa where she sang Isabelle in Robert le diable, Delizia in Ricci's Corrado d'Altamura, and Amina in La sonnambula. Miraglia died in 1881.

She appeared in Arne's Comus at Covent Garden in March 1776. She was a principal singer at the Royal Opera House from 6 December 1776 in Arne's opera Caractacus. Her performances were praised by The Morning Post, particularly a duet with Leoni. Her contralto pitch and relatively heavy build suited her for breeches roles, and she played the title role in Arne's Artaxerxes on 25 January 1777, Belford in Thomas Hull's Love Finds the Way, Colin in Charles Dibdin's Rose and Colin, and most notably Captain Macheath in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera where in 1777 she was the first person to sing \\"A-Hunting We Will Go\\", a song written by Arne for that performance.Boucé, Paul-Gabriel (ed.)

The insertion and the subsequent establishment of a perimeter was without incident. A company Swept North East and Established a night position at YA793879. B Company Went South and D Company pushed into the centre of the AO. ;3 March On 3 March, A company continued reconnaissance and was to establish a night position at YA812884 a location near LZ Brace. Upon arriving at their night location Company A established a perimeter and two men from third platoon were sent to recon a trail heading up the ridgeline. The patrol encountered two NVA soldiers at what appeared to be an enemy observation post with a cooking pot and a sleeping area prepared in the brush. The NVA soldiers fled up the hill before the patrol could take action. The patrol then reported back to their platoon leader Lt. Williams who was then ordered by the company CO Captain Isom to take 3d platoon up the trail in pursuit of the NVA soldiers. It was recommended by the company Artillery Observes Lt. Flannigan to prep the area with artillery before sending in 3d platoon , but was rejected by captain Isom. According to statements by Lt. Williams the company was outside of artillery range and the captain knew this. Lt. Williams led his platoon up the ridge line to a place were a large log had fallen across the path. At this time the company was engaged by an estimated battalion size enemy force in entrenched bunkers. Taking heavy casualties Lt. Williams radioed Captain Isom about the situation and asked for reinforcements. Captain Isom radioed the battalion CP at 1621hrs saying that A company had made contact with the enemy, left one squad from each company at the night position and led the rest of the company up the hill with the HQ element in the lead to reinforce 3d platoon. As the company moved up the ridge line they took sniper fire from the northeast on their left flank, even so they were able to reach 3d platoon’s position at the log. Shortly after reaching 3d platoon, 2d platoon leader Lt. Griffith was killed. The company was pinned down at their position from machine gun fire to their front and by NVA soldiers who had begun to climb the trees to their flanks and fire and hurl grenades down on them from above. At 1635hrs Captain Isom radioed 3rd Battalion CP and reported that he was in contact with a battalion size force and taking heavy casualties. Shortly after the HQ RTO was hit and Captain Isom was killed going to his aid. Landing Zone Brace Captain Isom, A Company CO As the only officer left in the fight Lt. Williams took command of the remainder of A company and ordered them to withdraw back to their night position. The company withdrew under heavy fire and was forced to leave their wounded. Two men were killed trying to assist a wounded soldier crawling across a clearing as they retreated. A company reached their night position at approximately 1800hrs and dug in for an expected enemy attack. Artillery and gunships were called in around the contact area , but not upon it for fear of hitting any surviving men left on the hill. A company was resupplied by helicopter, but only an estimated 20% of the resupply reached them. The rest was dropped off target and captured by the soldiers of the NVA. The Battalion Commander LTC Pennel J. Hickey flew overhead in an attempt to direct actions on the ground for a medevac. The medevac was only able to extract three men due to being under fire from NVA soldiers. The men stayed on alert throughout the night, but no attack materialised, they received sporadic sniper and rocket fire. During the night one of the wounded men left on the ridge line radioed the company requesting help, eight men were sent to retrieve him and they returned with him and another wounded man. After having received word that A company had come into contact with a large enemy force at LZ Brace, D company marched through the night to establish themselves at Hill 947 a position just over two kilometres south of A company, to prevent the enemy from escaping south. ;4 March On the morning of 4 March, Lt. Williams of A company was ordered to advance back up the ridge line to retrieve the wounded and killed from the day before. Twenty six men led by Sgt. Jones of 4th platoon were sent up the ridge. The patrol had only just cleared their perimeter line when they were engaged point blank by NVA soldiers. At this point A company came under fire from all around their position. The NVA soldiers used weapons and ammo captured during the battle the day before including M79 grenade launcher and M60 machine gun to assault their position. At 1125hrs an attempt was made to insert B company on a ridge line to the Northeast of LZ Brace with the purpose of reinforcing A company. The initial attempt was thwarted when the lead helicopter reported taking heavy fire at the landing zone. A second insertion was attempted at 1328hrs, but again took fire and evacuated. Using radios captured from A company the day before the NVA intercepted US communications and knew that B company was attempting to reinforce A company. Knowing this, NVA soldiers on the northern side of the perimeter yelled in English not to shoot and that they were B company. A company believing the trick left their foxholes to approach what they thought was B company. The NVA soldiers engaged the A company men point blank. The ruse broke moral and caused one man to bolt into the forest, after this A company’s northern perimeter collapsed. Lt. Williams gave the order to retreat along a stream bed downhill, where they regrouped under constant fire. They continued along another stream bed that took them to the top of a hill where they stopped and engaged perusing NVA troops. The company radioed for extraction and was guided to a landing zone by an LOH and was extracted at 1525hrs March 4. At 1540hrs B company was successfully inserted to their LZ on the North East side of LZ Brace after strikes from artillery and gunships. At 1600hrs D company made an attempt to reach A company’s position to the north, but came into contact with an enemy force while moving along a trail used by the NVA. After a brief firefight the NVA soldiers retreated and D company was able to rescue a POW from A company. The prisoner PFC. Guffy indicated that there was a large force of NVA to their North in prepared bunkers. D company was then ordered back to Hill 947 and ordered to dig in and prevent the enemy from escaping to the south. During the night the NVA probed D company’s perimeter, but were repulsed. Helicopter Landing on Brace Company Position's on March 5 ;5 March At 0750hrs D company’s position was assaulted from their eastern flank by an estimated 2 companies reinforced with sapper units. The assault was preceded by heavy mortar and B-40 rocket fire. The attack was repulsed with the help of artillery and gunship fire. At 0815hrs two NVA companies were positioning themselves to the East and West of Hill 947 for an assault, but were dislodged when D company launched a counterattack. The battle continued for the rest of the day with mortar and rocket fire as well as snipers taking shots at the entrenched unit. Captured A company claymores and tear gas were used in the attack against D company. Medevac and resupply helicopters took heavy fire during the day and one was forced to make an emergency landing into friendly territory when its fuel tank was hit. While the battle on Hill 947 was raging, B company continued its attack south towards LZ Brace. C company 3rd Battalion 8th Infantry joined the fight and attempted to insert into B company’s landing zone at 1035hrs, they took fire from the top of the hill and postponed the insertion until the area was prepped with artillery strikes. They successfully landed at 1320hrs and linked up with B company shortly before nightfall. D company sustained constant contact throughout the night and was supported by an AC-47 Spooky gunship. ;6 March D Company on Hill 497 on March 6, 1969 On 6 March, B & C company began a joint assault on LZ Brace. B company was able to get to within 150m of the top of the hill before they made contact. A joint flanking manoeuvre by B & C company to the enemies East and Western flank was unsuccessful. Both companies withdrew down the hill after artillery failed to break the NVA line. Airstrikes were called in and the NVA position was bombarded by 750lb delay fused bombs. At 1700hrs C company attacked and was successful in taking the Hill. B company joined later and helped set up a defensive position. That morning at 0700hrs D company was attacked by a mortar barrage followed by an attack on their position. D company was forced to call in artillery strikes on its own position to avoid being overrun. Gunships were called in to eliminate the remaining mortars and by the end of the day the NVA made no further attacks against Hill 947. Task force swift made up of elements of the 3rd Battalion 12th Infantry moved overland to positions southeast of LZ Brace to cut off and destroy any retreating NVA soldiers. PFC. Guffy Being Evacuated from Hill 497 ;7 March On the final day of the battle for LZ Brace Task Force Swift was extracted from YA788883 to LZ Brace and Helped B&C; companies secure the rest of the hill. C company of the 3rd Battalion 12th Infantry was airlifted to Hill 947 and reinforced D company. Contact on the 7th was light.  The loss of A Company  The main factor that contributed to the rout of A Company was that LZ Brace had been the Headquarters of NVA 66th Infantry. It is estimated that A company came into contact with a battalion sized force in a prepared position of inter connected bunkers. Other factors include the inability to call in artillery fire directly on the location after the contact, so as to not kill wounded troops left on the hill. Another key factor was the capture of friendly radio equipment that allowed the NVA to monitor US communications and employ a successful ruse de geurre against an already beleaguered A company. One soldier during the battle observed a NVA soldier with a PRC-77 on their back. Hill 947 With D Company Platoon Positions The Company CO was also new to Vietnam with little combat experience. This as well as reports of A company being undermanned due to several seasoned NCO’s being on leave at the time of deployment, contributed to A company’s demise.  Execution of wounded  According to accounts from Lt. John Bauer, PFC. Guffy upon being rescued reported that after his position had been taken and A company had retreated, soldiers of the NVA executed the wounded US soldiers that A company left. He was left alive because the NVA required a prisoner.  Discrepancies in US casualty reports  A company entered the field with 115 men. Accounts from the surviving men of A company, suggest 33 to 35 men made it aboard the evacuation helicopters. This is confirmed by the duty officer’s log which states that 36 men made it to the helicopters. These including the 3 WIA evacuated the previous night, 3 MIA who later made their way back to friendly territory and PFC. Guffy who was rescued by D company makes a total of 43 survivors. This make for a total of 72 casualties. Lt. Williams who made an assessment of their number after their original firefight estimated 35 KIA, 5 WIA and 20 MIA. Despite this, the official after action report by COL. Hale H. Knight, states that A company sustained only 22 KIA and 52 WIA. In statements authored by LT. Bauer of D company it is suggested that up to 50 men were killed. For the entire battle the official casualty toll was: 32KIA,125WIA and 1MIA for the US and 241KIA for the NVA.  After battle  On 16 March 6th Battalion, 29th Artillery moved to LZ Brace. Current use The landing zone has reverted to jungle.

He went on to complete a master's degree at the Institute of Development Studies, which is attached to the University of Sussex, and returned to Oxford to complete a doctorate in economics under the supervision of Włodzimierz Brus, which he did in 1989. From 1989 to 1993, Tsakalotos worked at the University of Kent, where he met his partner, Heather D. Gibson. He moved to Greece, and taught at the Athens University of Economics and Business from 1994 to 2010, becoming a professor of economics. Since 2010, he has been a professor of economics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He has written a number of books in both Greek and English and has been published in a range of different academic journals. Due to his upbringing in the UK, he speaks English with a British accent. A student member of the Communist Party of Greece, Tsakalotos joined Synaspismos in the early 1990s and was elected to the Central Committee of Syriza in 2004 shortly after their formation. He was first elected as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens B in the May 2012 legislative election and has been re-elected in every election since. In opposition from 2012 to 2015, he was Syriza's shadow finance minister. When Syriza entered government in January 2015, Tsakalotos was appointed as an Alternate Minister within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In April, he took over as head of Greece's negotiating team on the third bailout package. On 6 July 2015, following Yanis Varoufakis's resignation, Tsakalotos was appointed as Minister of Finance.

In St Paul's School's alumni magazine, he praised his former schoolmaster Keith Perry, saying that the teacher did \\"much to bolster [his] self-confidence\\". During his time at the school, he co-founded its Economics and Politics Society (known as Polecon) with his close friend Owen Tudor, who now works for the Trades Union Congress. Tsakalotos went on to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at The Queen's College, Oxford. Whilst at the Queen's College, Tsakalotos was an admirer of both G. A. Cohen and Andrew Glyn, a Marxist political philosopher and Marxian economist respectively, who both taught at the university. He also took part in student protests against Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government. During his time at university, he became a supporter of Irish republicanism, a view he expressed in his visit to the Sinn Féin ardfheis in March 2015. One of his university friends at this time, Yannis Stournaras, later became a Greek finance minister and served as Governor of the Bank of Greece. Following graduation, he completed a master's degree (MPhil) at the Institute of Development Studies, attached to the University of Sussex. He then returned to Oxford to complete a doctorate (DPhil) in economics, studying at Mansfield College. He completed this doctorate in 1989 under the supervision of Włodzimierz Brus, with his thesis, Alternative Economic Strategies: The Case of Greece, later being published as a book.Tsakalotos, Euclid, Heather Gibson, ed., Alternative Economic Strategies: The Case of Greece (Aldershot, Avebury Publishers: 1991),  Academic career  After the completion of his doctorate, Tsakalotos entered into an academic career. His first role was as a research associate at the University of Kent, from 1989 to 1990. From October 1990 to June 1993, he taught at the university as a lecturer. In 1993, Tsakalotos and his wife moved to Greece, and in October 1994 he began teaching at the Athens University of Economics and Business. In September 2010, he became a full professor of economics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, more commonly referred to simply as the University of Athens.Euclid Tsakalotos: National & Kapodistrian University of Athens. uoa.academia.edu. Retrieved 6 July 2015 In his capacity as an academic, Tsakalotos served as a member of the executive committee of the Hellenic Federation of University Teachers' Associations (POSDEP). In the mid-2000s, Tsakalotos led his students in a several months- long protest against proposed reforms to the Greek education system. Thanos Tsouknidas, an accountant that knew Tsakalotos at the time, said: \\"He was there, involved in the struggle. We were fighting together.\\" His active role in the teachers' union brought him popularity, and according to a former student, his classes were often packed. Tsakalotos has written a number of books and articles on Greek and international economic policies, alone and in cooperation with other academics and writers. He has co-authored a number of works with his wife, who has also served as editor for some of the works that he has written alone.  Early political career  As a student at the University of Oxford, Tsakalotos joined the Communist Party of Greece (Interior), a eurocommunist party that had split from the main Communist Party of Greece, a Marxist–Leninist party, in 1968. In the early 1990s, shortly after moving to Greece, Tsakalotos became a member of Synaspismos, a radical left-wing political party, which was to become the largest constituent party of Syriza. Syriza itself was formed in 2004, ahead of that year's legislative election, as a coalition of 13 left-wing political parties in Greece. Tsakalotos was elected to their Central Committee in December 2004. The Greek Government syriza.gr.

Shortly after Syriza was formed, Tsakalotos stood as their candidate for the prefecture of Preveza in the 2004 legislative election. The Greek government-debt crisis effectively began in 2009 and was a backdrop for Tsakalotos' involvement in the creation of Syriza's economic policy. Tsakalotos has been credited as the \\"brains behind\\" the policy, and as a member of Syriza's \\"economics quartet\\", alongside John Milios, Giorgos Stathakis and Yannis Dragasakis. He has also been credited as one author of Syriza's Thessaloniki Programme, a manifesto which proposed a set of policies oriented towards reversing austerity measures while maintaining a balanced budget.

development of literacy and enable digital fluency while using mobile devices, especially mobile phones. Mobile literacy is also known by the abbreviation mLiteracy. The mLiteracy ecosystem in South Africa was mapped at the mLiteracy Network Meeting hosted by the Goethe-Institut Johannesburg in January 2015. The starting point for meeting was the UNESCO study \\"Reading in the Mobile Era\\" (2014), which takes a closer look at the implications of reading on mobile devices in developing countries. mLiteracy Visualisation  Ecosystem of mLiteracy in South Africa  The mLiteracy ecosystem in South Africa has developed organically through the work of several stakeholders who use mobile platforms to encourage access to text, stories and reading materials. Role players within this ecosystem include content providers, platforms, mobile networks, funding agencies, training facilities (including schools and libraries), authors and users. Several organisations working within or based in South Africa have links to and synergies with projects across Africa. Most of the projects use open licences, specifically Creative Commons licences. Historically, the target group of most projects have been children, teenagers and young adults. Recent data from the South African Department for Basic Education showed that 53% of all Grade 3 children and 70% of all Grade 6 children scored less than 35% on the Annual National Assessment language test.Report of the Annual National Assessments (2011) (Retrieved 8.2.2015) With high mobile penetration in South Africa (some claims as high as 128%) there is potential to engage with learners and young adults at every stage of their development via mobile devices. = Content providers = *African Storybook, founded in 2013, the African Storybook has published numerous openly licensed illustrated children's stories for 2 to 10-year-olds in a variety of African languages and English. The site has tools for the creation, translation and adaptation of stories. The project, an initiative of the South African Institute for Distance Education (SAIDE) (an NGO based in Johannesburg), is funded by the UK organisation Comic Relief. The African Storybook publishes stories in over 40 different African languages. *Book Dash, founded in 2014, Book Dash creates new, African storybooks for young children, published under a creative commons attribution licence. Their sponsors and partners include the Central Library Cape Town, The African Storybook, Rock Girl and many others. On Book Dash Days, volunteer writers, illustrators and designers work together to create complete books in just one day. These are then made available as print-ready and mobile-ready files. *Bookly, founded in 2011 by Cover2Cover Books was launched in 2013 by NATIVE VML. It encourages teenagers to read some of the 450 stories available via the Mxit platform (now defunct) and write their own short stories. *FunDza aims to encourage teenagers to read for pleasure. The FunDza Literacy Trust was. As of January 2015, 50000 teenagers were reading FunDza stories via their mobile phone every month. Additionally, readers are encouraged to comment on what they read and to write their own stories. FunDza publishes stories in all of the eleven official languages of South Africa. *Nal'ibali, primarily aiming at adults, Nal'ibali provides children's stories parents can read to their children. It was funded by PRAESA (The Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa), Times Media, and the DG Murray Trust in 2012 and focuses on \\"reading for pleasure\\". Nal'ibali publishes stories in all of the eleven official languages of South Africa. *Penreach has initiated the Asifundze Programme in Ehlanzeni (Mpumalanga), focused on improving literacy and numeracy among young children between the ages of 5 and 9, this programme targets a broad stakeholder group including; teachers, parents, community groups and district officials. More specifically with the aim of: #Improving Home Language, English Language and basic numeracy skills among young children in disadvantaged communities in Mpumalanga; #Rapidly increasing the availability and use of reading materials in poor communities; #Rapidly increasing community involvement in literacy development and establishing a culture of reading in poor communities in Mpumalanga. *Worldreader was founded in 2010 by Coleen McElwee and David Risher, the former Senior Vice President for Amazon's US Retails.

Since the launch of the project Worldreader has made 15519 books available via mobile phones. *Yoza Cellphone Stories was launched in 2009 as a Shuttleworth Foundation project led by Steve Vosloo. The project provides a number of stories accessible on basic mobile phones. Due to lack of funding Yoza is not an active project anymore, but their stories can still be accessed via their website. Yoza published stories in English and isiXhosa. *Puku Children's Literature Foundation is a reading promotion and book curation organisation that aims to ensure that all children have access to quality, culturally relevant literature in all South African languages. One of Puku’s primary vehicles for promoting this, is the creation of an engaging and innovative digital encyclopedia that houses and reviews literature and bodies of work for what will be South Africa’s first comprehensive database of children’s literature (Pukupedia) and which promotes the buying and reading of books that affirm the African child. = Contribution and licence activators = *Creative Commons South Africa provides a pool of copyright licenses in order to simplify sharing creative works and enabling universal access to knowledge. Some of the above-mentioned projects work under a CC license. *WikiAfrica is an initiative which aims at encouraging the transfer and development of African content onto Wikipedia.

In South Africa there is a limited version of WikiZero available to users of the MTN network. = Library-based projects = *The Johannesburg City Library has launched some initiatives supporting eLearning and promoting techno-literacy. *The Library and Information Association of South Africa (LIASA), launched in 1997, aims at building capacity for libraries, expanding access to content and providing a platform for libraries and librarians. *The Ulwazi Programme, established in 2008 by the eThekwini Municipality’s Libraries and Heritage Department, Ulwazi was the first project by a library in South African to collect and share knowledge about local culture and history. The project encouraged local communities to participate in sharing local knowledge online and increase internet use in Africa. = Research into mobile literacy = ;Researching Mobile Media at the University of Cape Town: Researchers at the University of Cape Town have conducted a number of research projects exploring mobile literacy. These include studies of digital literacy and the relationship between mobile literacies and multilingualism. Walton, Marion: Mobile Literacy & South African Teens: Leisure reading, writing, and MXit chatting for teens in Langa and Guguletu (December 2009) (Retrieved 2.8.2015) Projects have highlighted the important role of public access spaces such as libraries and cybercafes in supporting mobile literacies.Walton, M., & Donner, J.

National Library Service of Kenya (KNLS) develops, promotes, establishes and equips libraries in Kenya. Their mission is to enable access to information and knowledge to promote literacy in Kenya. *German Library Association: compared to South Africa, mobile phones do not play a very significant role in Germany, but they are becoming more important in Germany as well. The GLA has launched the \\"Reading is strength\\" project which aims at improving digital and new media competence. *Mobiliteracy Uganda: supported by the United States Agency for International Development promotes literacy by sending messages containing reading lessons to an adult's phone they can share with their children. Alternatively, additional audio-files are used in order to enable illiterate parents to participate in the project. *Sen Mobile: launched in Senegal, Sen Mobile provides Mobile Development, SMS Service, Quality Assurance and Quality & Training. Their main focus is mobile learning, health and entertainment.  Developments and challenges  Since the implementation of the first projects in the year 2009,\\"...the pilot phase of the project a mobile novel (m-novel) was written and published in September 2009 on a mobisite and on MXit\\". (Retrieved 8.2.2015) the mLiteracy landscape in South Africa has undergone some promising developments: *The number of feature and smart phones is rising significantly\\"Nearly two-thirds (65%) of households in 23 countries in sub- Saharan Africa had at least one mobile phone in 2013, with median growth of 27% since 2008 and median annual growth of 5%.\\" (Retrieved 8.2.2015) *More and more mLiteracy projects for formal and informal learning have been established (see above) *The importance of training educators and parents in the field of the educational potential of mobile phones is growing. *Access to literature and literacy projects via mobile phone serves the form of communication young people are accustomed to. *The number of relevant content (for example e-books) is growing. (partly provided by the above projects) On the other side, there are still a number of major challenges: *The lack of Africa- relevant content and content in African languages remains a major problem \\"There are more Wikipedia articles written about Antarctica than all but one of the 54 countries in Africa.\\" (Retrieved 8.2.2015) *The costs of airtime to access information via mobile phones can in many cases be threshold, the majority of users (96%) access the internet on their mobile phone via prepaid, which is more expensive than network contracts. Research ICT Africa Policy Brief No 2: Internet going mobile - Internet access and usage in 11 African countries (Sept. 2012) (retrieved 8.2.2015) *Most of the projects that make content available for free rely on funding from NGOs and are therefore often not sustainable. *Parents, educators and librarians are not aware enough about the opportunities the access to information via mobile phone offers. *Gender equality is also a problem when it come to access to mobile phones. The UNESCO study \\"Reading in the mobile era\\" shows that there are by far more male mobile readers than female. But once women gain access, they tend to read six times longer than men. The study also showed, that 2/3 of the women read stories, which they access via their phones, to their children. Making mobile devices accessible for women, will also increase childhood literacy.

Parliament presidency  Subsequent to her initiative, two Committees of the Greek Parliament were set up: * the Truth Committee on Public Debt, the first and only Debt Auditing Committee ever established on EU soil, with the mandate to audit Greece's public debt and * the Committee on German Reparations, with the mandate to promote the active Greek claims against Germany, for the restitution of the damages caused to Greece by the Nazi occupation, including reparations to victims, reimbursement of the forcible \\"loan\\" taken by the occupation forces and the return of the stolen archaeological treasures. * During her Presidency, she was also elected President of the Committee on Institutions and Transparency and initiated 2 Anti-corruption investigations on 2 major corruption cases, the Siemens Scandal (entailing bribery and money laundering of government officials by Siemens) and the Lagarde List Affair (entailing large-scale tax-evasion and major economic crime by political personnel and the country's economic, media and banking elites). End of term * She presided the Parliament until the summer of 2015 and presided over the session which decided to hold a Referendum on the ultimatum advanced at the time by Greece's creditors. When the referendum outcome, saying NO to more austerity and liquidation measures, was violated by the SYRIZA Government, which consented to the Coup d' Etat effectuated by Greece's creditors (3rd Memorandum), Konstantopoulou clashed with the Party leadership and fought against the measures imposed upon the people. Her term was abruptly terminated when the Tsipras government inadvertently quit from office in order to cause early elections, in collaboration with Greece's creditors. During those elections, Konstantopoulou ran as an independent candidate, collaborating with the newly formed party Popular Unity. The elections were characterized by a record abstention: a total of 52% of the voters did not register a vote (48,5% abstaining and 3,5% registering a blank or null vote), due to the major shock caused by the violation of the referendum mandate. Popular Unity did not enter Parliament, coming short of the threshold by 7.000 votes ...  International activity  Zoe is active at an international level with academic, political and professional alliances around the globe. During the last 6 years she has been speaking at international fora about the injustices against the Greek People and the economic and political dictatorship imposed upon Greece by its creditors and the banking system. She has also been vocal in the defense of the human rights of other peoples, registering her support to the people of Palestine and defending the Catalan referendum. In August 2015 she created, together with Jean Luc Melenchon, Oscar Lafontaine and Stefano Fassina, the initiative called Plan B, to defend Democracy against the antidemocratic methods of the E.U. Ever since 2015, when the Greek Referendum was violated by Greece's Creditors and the Greek Government, she has been travelling around the world, giving more than 40 speeches to students and academics (Columbia University, LSE, ULB), citizens, lawyers, activists etc., speaking about the Greek case and asking for support in the fight of the Greek people. She has also been presiding the Truth Committee on Public Debt, which was transformed into a citizens' association when the Government tried to shut it down after the September 2015 elections.  Early academic and professional life  Since 2003, she has been an active lawyer in the field of Criminal and International Criminal Law with a strong emphasis on the defense of human rights. As a student at the Athens University she worked as a stagiaire at the Athens Bar Law Clinic. She was a member of the Athens Bar Committee, which in July 2003 drafted and filed a criminal complaint. submitted to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, for international crimes committed by British officers in Iraq, analyzing the criminal responsibility of Tony Blair and his government officials. She has also filed a criminal complaint against Henri Kissinger, on behalf of the late renowned journalist Elias Demetracopoulos, for international crimes committed in Greece and in Cyprus. Since 1999 she is a member of the International Association of Penal Law. In 2001, she worked as an intern at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Trial Chamber). In the years 2007-2012 she was the President of the Young Penalists Committee of the International Association of Penal Law having organized and participated in a number of international conferences and working groups. In 1998 – 2000 she participated in a Programme for the Education of Prisoners teaching English to prisoners of the Fresnes prison in France. On 2011 she was elected Secretary General of the Observatory on International Organizations and Globalization (PADOP). Her articles have been published in scientific reviews but also in the press. Along with her studies at Columbia University, she was a stagiaire in the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations. She also offered pro bono legal aid to low income citizens regarding housing, as part of a law clinic at her University.  Course to Freedom and related initiatives  Konstantopoulou is leading the political movement Course to Freedom, initiated in April 2016, as an open, direct-democracy movement, with the major goals to fight for democracy, justice, transparency, human rights, the abolition of illegal debt and the claiming of the German reparations for WW1-WW2. Course to Freedom is in close collaboration with several social movements in Greece and abroad. The cornerstone of its actions is Civil Disobedience as a means to re-establish popular sovereignty and fight off the debt-enslavement of the country and of the people. Course to Freedom and its connected Movement \\"No to their Yes's\\" have taken several initiatives to defend public property from liquidation and to defend people's homes from being taken away by banks, which are some of the \\"measures\\" imposed to repay Greece's debt. Konstantopoulou and Course to Freedom have created \\"Justice for All\\", a legal entity defending the public interest and people's rights in major corruption and public interest cases. Course to Freedom is also connected with the Artists' Movement \\"I won't bow\\", initiated in March 2017 by actor and director Diamantis Karanastasis, a leading figure in the Course to Freedom Movement and initiator and director of Freedomtv, the new medium launched in January 2018 by Course to Freedom at www.freedomtv.gr to empower the people to gain access to real information, rebut propaganda and directly disseminate their own news, views articles, videos, etc.  References   External links  * * Category:1976 births Category:People from Athens Category:Living people Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Greek women lawyers Category:Human rights lawyers Category:Syriza politicians Category:Greek MPs 2012 (May) Category:Greek MPs 2012–2014 Category:Greek MPs 2015 (February–August) Category:Speakers of the Hellenic Parliament Category:21st-century Greek politicians Category:21st-century Greek women politicians Category:20th-century Greek lawyers Category:21st-century Greek lawyers Category:20th-century women lawyers Category:21st-century women lawyers ","title":"Zoe Konstantopoulou"},{"id":"45236210","text":"Fu Jen-kun (, Russian: Фу Жень-кунь, 1954–2014), also known as Fu Ren-Kun, was a professor of international relations from Taiwan.

She was closely associated with Andrew Plimer, who married her sister. Biography Knight was born on 7 September 1776 at Birchin Lane, London, the daughter of Frances Woodcock and John Knight, a City of London merchant. She was one of ten children of the family. Mary Ann Knight Robert Owen, 1800 At the age of twenty-six she began to paint portraits in order to assist her parents, who had fallen upon hard times, and she received instruction in miniature work from Andrew Plimer. It is stated that it was through her coming for lessons that he made the acquaintance of her elder sister Joanna Louisa, whom he afterwards married. He seems to have retained a considerable affection for Mary Ann, and she spent much of her time at his house. Although she was receiving skills that Plimer himself had been indulgently given by his own master Richard Cosway.V. Remington, ‘Plimer, Andrew (1763–1837)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 28 Jan 2015 She painted portraits from 1802 down to 1836, a period of thirty-four years, and a list of her works, extracted from her note-books, are appended in Williamson (1903) She kept a very careful account of her earnings, and records that she made the sum of £5,171 9s. 8d., being an average of 150 guineas a year throughout the above period. At first, however, the sums which she obtained for her work were very small, ranging from two to four guineas for a portrait. Occasionally for some years she was able to get five, and even six guineas for a larger portrait, but the average price continued lower than that. Gradually, however, her prices crept up, and at the end of 1805 she was receiving nine guineas for the larger and seven guineas for the smaller size, and ten guineas for portraits of children, with which she was known to be particularly successful. In 1809 ten guineas seems to have been her usual price, and in 1815 this became fifteen guineas, occasionally rising to twenty, and, in a few instances, even to thirty guineas for the portrait of a child. Miss Knight began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1803, and sent in all thirty pictures to that gallery, exhibiting also two unnamed pictures at the Old Water-Colour Society. She ceased work in 1836, having recorded altogether 696 portraits, at an average price of 7.5 guineas apiece. Certain portraits appearing in the Royal Academy catalogues are not to be found in her list, in which there are many curious omissions. Some years have hardly any entries given to them, and nothing at all actually appears marked for the years 1818, 1820, and 1832, although Academy catalogues show her exhibiting in 1818. Joanne Baillie by Knight She resided at one time at Hampstead, but it is not known exactly where, as the word Hampstead is the only address which she gives on her letters. At another time she was at Wicken, Stony Stratford, where her parents were residing. In 1813 her brother in Philadelphia wrote to her at her studio in Old Bond Street. Later on she was again at Hampstead, and towards the end of her life she lived at Grove End Road, St. John's Wood, and there in 1851 she died, at the age of eighty-five. Comparatively few of her portraits have been identified, although many of them still exist, either attributed to the wrong artists, or marked in catalogues as by unknown hands. The most notable collection of her portraits is a series at Belvoir Castle, representing various members of the Manners family. Another two portraits are of the dramatist Joanne BaillieJoanne Baillie, Mary Ann Knight, National Galleries, retrieved 28 January 2015 and the philanthropist Robert Owen are in the National Galleries of Scotland. The picture of Baillie may be a copy as the sitter allowed only one copy to be made as she would not permit an engraving to be made but one of these is in the gallery. The fate of the preparatory sketches she made for these paintings and many those of other people such as Lady Caroline Lamb, her own and the Byron family are now unknown.Annette Peach, ‘Knight, Mary Ann (1776–1851)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 Jan 2015 The success which Miss Knight obtained in her portraits of children appears to have been the result of her engaging charm, quiet soft voice, merry vivacious manner, and great kindliness of disposition. All these qualities enabled her to appeal to her juvenile sitters, and they were ever ready to listen to her stories and to sit to her for as long as she desired to have them. It is certain that she was able to catch their arch and roguish expression, to represent them as real children, and to capture in her rapid and sketchy portraits excellent likenesses of the little ones with whom she was so popular. Critical appraisal Her portraits are generally of large size, and as a rule pale, even somewhat washy in colour, but there are cases in which she has employed a dark and rich scheme of colouring (such as in the portraits of Lady Bagot and Lady Fanny Ponsonby belonging to the Plimer family), and in such instances she was very partial to the use of a rich purple, resembling the bloom of a grape. According to Williamson, it is unfortunate that she was at times influenced by the affected custom of that period, which delighted to depict the children as angels, or in classical attire. Had she confined herself exclusively to genuine portraiture she would have been far more successful, and there is no doubt that her best portraits are those in which she did not aim at any representation of allegorical allusion or classical detail, but was content to paint the child as he was, in a natural attitude. Her drawing, according to Williamson, is unsatisfactory; the defects in the drawing of arms or of the neck are those of her teacher, and can be found in almost all his best works. There are a few portraits by her in existence in which she set herself to copy the style of Anthony Stewart, a noted painter of babies at the time, and the portraits which she executed of the infant children of Lady Denbigh are good examples of this special experiment. They possess many of the characteristics of Stewart's work.

He was born at Sandsend, Lythe, North Yorkshire and died at West Wickham, Kent. Raynor was educated at Brentwood Grammar School, from where he won a scholarship to Winchester College, and at St John's College, Cambridge. At Winchester, he was a right- handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, but at Cambridge he batted very low in the batting order. The 37 not out that he made in the match against Surrey in 1872 constituted more than half of his total first-class runs and was made from No 11 in the batting line-up. In the previous match, he had taken five wickets in the second innings of the Gentlemen of England game for 44 runs, and this was the best bowling performance of his first-class career. He was picked for the 1872 University Match against Oxford University, but was not successful, failing to take a wicket. In 1873, he played only a single match, again with little success, and was not selected again. Raynor graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1875 and took up a post as an assistant master at Repton School; he was ordained as a Church of England priest in 1877. From 1881 to 1886 he was headmaster of Kensington Foundation School and for the last year of his life was headmaster of the Royal Naval Academy at Gosport.

He was an influential musician of his time. The rudra veena, also called the bin, came into prominence during the time of Tansen's contemporary, and son-in-law, Naubat Khan. In the paintings of the time, it is clearly Naubat Khan and not Tansen who is associated with the instrument. Naubat Khan was the honorary title conferred by Mughal Emperor Jahangir on Ali Khan Karori. Early life and background Naubat Khan was the grandson of Raja Samokhan Singh of Kishangarh, and the son-in-law of the legendary Tansen. Samokhan Singh, a Jodhpur prince, was himself a great veena player of his time. He was defeated by the forces of the Mughal emperor Akbar, and his grandson Misri Singh (Naubat Khan) was kept under house arrest. Misri Singh later accepted Islam and was named Ali. He was trained under Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, the son of Bairam Khan to get an understanding of the Mughal court procedures. Ali was given the title of Khan by Akbar, and the post of Karori, i.e. Collector of revenue. He was later given the prestigious position of the darogha of the Naqqar Khana. As mentioned in Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, Ali Khan Karori was given the title of Naubat Khan and rank of 500 personnel and 200 horse on 14 Rabi ul Awwal 1016 Hijri(Monday 9 July,1607,Gregorian), during Jahangir's visit to Kabul. Marriage with Saraswati Naubat Khan first married Ahmad Khan Mughal's daughter. After his first wife's death, he married Tansen's daughter, Saraswati. Saraswati accepted Islam and was named Hussaini. They had a son named Lal Khan. Lal Khan was the son-in-law of Tansen's son Bilas Khan. Lal Khan was the chief musician of Emperor Shahjahan. Shahajahan conferred on him the title of Gunsamundra.

Caburlotto was cleared for beatification in 2014 after a miracle was found to have been attributed to his intercession and he was beatified on 16 May 2015 in Venice by Cardinal Angelo Amato on behalf of Pope Francis. Biography Luigi Caburlotto was born in Venice in 1817 as the son of a Venetian gondolier. Caburlotto entered the seminary in Venice and was ordained to the priesthood on 24 September 1842. Caburlotto worked with young people who were either abandoned or homeless and spent six years of intense pastoral work. He made it his job to study the social situation of the population, and placed emphasis on the youth. On 30 April 1850, he established a school for poor and abandoned girls. Thus, the Daughters of Saint Joseph was founded. Caburlotto placed importance on the catechetical formation of the people and stressed the importance of the frequent reception of the sacraments. His work continued in 1857 when he founded a home for poor girls and in 1859, a complex for the poor. He also established a free college and in 1869, was assigned to revive the Manin Institute which served as a trade school for men. By 1881, he had taken over poor schools and revived them with staff and resources. But by this time, he remained at his home parish due to failing health, where he conducted retreats for the clergy and the laity. Caburlotto spent his final years away from his institutions and he lived a quiet and private life. He continued to keep track of all his institutions, for they were very close to him, but he could not go to visit them due to his failing health. Luigi Caburlotto died in 1897 with the Patriarch of Venice Cardinal Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto - future Pope Pius X - at his bedside. His remains were moved on 1 March 2009 to the parish of Saint Sebastian. Beatification The cause of beatification for Caburlotto commenced at a diocesan level on 14 September 1963 which finalized its work on 28 June 1969. Pope John Paul II recognized his life of heroic virtue and named him to be Venerable on 2 July 1994. A miracle attributed to his intercession was investigated from 22 December 2009 to 28 September 2010; the investigation was validated in 2012. It first went to a medical board in 2013 and went to theologians before proceeding to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for approval both in 2014. Pope Francis recognized a miracle attributed to his intercession on 9 May 2014 and his beatification was celebrated on 16 May 2015 in Venice. Cardinal Angelo Amato - on behalf of the pope - presided over the beatification.

The trail runs through a deep gully with leafy vegetation growing alongside. The rocky slopes are deeply grooved due to rainwater runoff, creating a variety of sculpted shapes. The vegetation, mostly stone pines and typical coastal scrub plants such as juniper, sometimes grow on the edge of small abysses caused by landslides, with their tangled roots exposed to the air. Many birds dig shelters and nests in the rock face, including European bee- eaters, after which the beach is named. , Beach Guide in Algarve Access Access can be made by car or on foot, by an unpaved track.

She assumed the name \\"Irene\\" upon entrance into that order and she became a missionary in Kenya. She was cleared for beatification in 2014 after a miracle found to have been attributed to her intercession was ratified, and she was beatified on 23 May 2015 in Nyeri by Cardinal Polycarp Pengo on behalf of Pope Francis. Biography Stefani was born in 1891 in the small village of Anfo as one of twelve children and was baptized in the name of \\"Aurelia Jacoba Mercede\\" on the following 23 August. Her mother died on 12 May 1907 and this left Stefani in the delicate position of the management of her siblings and assisting her father, especially in the Christian formation of her younger sisters Marietta and Antonietta, and her brother Ugo who died not long after this. She received Confirmation on 6 November 1898 and later received her First Communion a few years following this. Stefani joined the Consolata Missionary Sisters in June 1911 and became a professed member of that order on 29 January 1914 prior to the beginning of World War I. Upon entering the order, she took the name of \\"Irene\\". That same year, she was sent by Blessed Giuseppe Allamano to go to Kenya, leaving on 28 December 1914, where she arrived in January 1915. Stefani served as a nurse in Kenya and became well known and well regarded among the people that she served. This earned her the nickname \\"Nyaatha\\" (Nyina wa tha), which is a name literally translated as \\"mother of mercy\\". With the onslaught of World War I, she served in hospitals to tend to the wounded soldiers and those others wounded in the conflict. On 20 August 1916, she was appointed as a Red Cross to assist the Carriers who were forced to march exhaustingly in the African terrain. During this time, she worked in military hospitals in places such as Lindi and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Blessed Irene Stefani circa 1920. At the conclusion of the war in 1918, Stefani returned to Nyeri where she first served as an assistant formator of the first aspirants of the incipient local congregation known as the Mary Immaculate Sisters. Two years later, she was appointed to Our Lady of Divine Providence mission at Gikondi, remaining there until her death. There, she taught in schools and instructed parishioners in catechism while visiting the villages. At Gikhondi, she was the Superior of the Consolata Missionary Sisters for eight years. In 1930, Stefani contracted a disease from one of the patients she was treating and grew physically weak in the summer, losing a considerable amount of weight, bearing this as God's will. On 20 October, she felt sick yet opted to visit a plague-stricken person, remaining at his bedside for several hours. She succumbed eleven days later, on 31 October 1930. Beatification The cause of beatification commenced on 22 July 1985 under Pope John Paul II and Stefani was declared a Servant of God; this acted as the formal beginning of the cause and it saw the accumulation of documents and testimonies in order to support the cause. On 2 April 2011, Pope Benedict XVI declared her to have lived a life of heroic virtue and declared her to be Venerable. On 12 June 2014, Pope Francis approved a decree that recognized a miracle attributed to Stefani's intercession which cleared the way for her beatification. It was celebrated by Cardinal Polycarp Pengo on 23 May 2015 in Nyeri.

Life Details about the life of Lucas Smout are scarce. He was born in Antwerp as the youngest child of the painter and art dealer Lucas Smout the Elder and Anna Maria Tijssens. His father had studied under Artus Wolffort and was a figure painter. His brother Dominicus (or Domien) became a genre painter while two of his sisters married painters.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1056–1059 His mother was a member of the prominent Tijssens or Tyssens family of artists in Antwerp, which included artists such as Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger.Danielle Maufort , Het Antwerps kunstenaarsgeslacht Tijssens (Thyssens) uit de 17e en het begin van de 18e eeuw en zijn stamvader Augustijn Tijssens de Oude, 7 september 1999 His father died in 1674 and his mother in 1686. His sister Clara Catharina continued to operate the art and painting materials business of her parents. Upon discovering Lucas' artistic talent, she sent him to study art under a master. The Beach of Scheveningen Lucas was registered in 1685-86 in the registers of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of the marine artist Hendrik van Minderhout.Lucas Smout at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Smout was active in Antwerp throughout his career but must have visited the Dutch Republic since he painted a few views of Scheveningen beach.Lucas Smout II, Het strand bij Scheveningen at Vlaamse kunstcollectie Lucas Smout, The beach of Scheveningen at Atena Smout was not very productive as he suffered from gout, which affected his hands. This may also be the reason why he remained unmarried and lived in the house of his eldest sister Clara Catharina who was married to the painter Gonzales Franciscus Casteels. Another sister married the painter Jacob Herreyns the Elder.Jacob Herreyns at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He died in Antwerp in 1713. Work Like his master Hendrik van Minderhout, Lucas Smout specialized mainly in marine views, which the populated with many ships and figures.Fernand Donnet, Luc Smout in: Biographie Nationale, Volume 22, pp. 884–885 Only a few works by his hand are known. He painted a number of coastal scenes depicting various activities relating to the return of fishing boats with their catch or the loading of vessels. They include a view of The Beach of Scheveningen (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). This work is typical of Smout's busy compositions: it includes many groups of people and a wide range of activities taking place on the beach, such as pulling fishing boats onto the land, men hauling wood, soldiers transporting two gun barrels, fishmongers and on the far right - next to a cannon - a man drawing, which is likely a self-portrait. Smout collaborated on a beach view with Pieter Bout who painted the staffage. This work referred to as Harbour and Fish Market (Musée des beaux-arts de Quimper) possibly also represents a view of the beach and port of Scheveningen as in its composition and figures it closely resembles Pieter Bout's Selling Fish at the Beach of Scheveningen (Van Ham Auctions, 11 May 2012, Lot 518).Visverkoop op het strand van Scheveningen The village square Smout painted some village scenes with feasts such as The village square (Christie's, 19 March 2010, Paris, lot 75) or a cavalry engagement such as A cavalry skirmish in a village (Christie's, 23 May 2000, New York, lot 279).

On 18 December 2012, the Government of Ireland via the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Phil Hogan designated the area an SDZ pursuant to its powers under the Planning and Development Act 2000. This was the first step in establishing a new framework to try to facilitate faster development in these areas. It replaced the regime overseen by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA), which was taken over by Dublin City Council in 2014. SDZ Planning Scheme On 16 May 2014 An Bord Pleanala approved the making of a planning scheme for the area subject to modifications as set out in its decision. Under the scheme, some 366,000 square metres of office space and 2,600 homes will be developed across 22 hectares of land in the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock. In the North Lotts area, the new hubs will be at Spencer Dock and the Point Village. South of the river, the replacement for the U2 Tower will anchor another hub, while two more hubs will be clustered around Barrow Street including the Boland's Mill site, and Grand Canal Square. Two landmark buildings up to 22 storeys (88m) are allowed, but most development will be eight-storeys high. SDZ status means that projects can be fast-tracked through planning, subject to criteria. NAMA plans to invest €2bn in new projects over the coming years, and is a key landholder across the Docklands including sites previously controlled by Treasury Holdings, developer Harry Crosbie and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. History =2012-2015: Origins and planning stages= The SDZ Planning Scheme replaces the DDDA North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock Planning Schemes that had been generated under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (the 2000 Act), focusing on urban regeneration of Dublin's docklands and redundant port areas. While the Master Plan prepared by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) covered an area of approximately 520 hectares, the centre of gravity of redevelopment focused on the areas in the North Lotts, extending eastwards from the Custom House Docks (phase 1 & 2) including the IFSC and Spencer Dock, and on the Grand Canal Dock area south of the River Liffey. The collapse of the banking sector in wake of the 2008 financial crisis, combined with a major downturn in the Irish economy, had a profound impact on the development sector and on the regeneration programme within Docklands. Most major property developers are now linked with NAMA - there was paralysis in the construction sector, and investor confidence had dried up. The SDZ Planning Scheme is geared to unlock the current set of difficulties and provide a blueprint for the years ahead. In renewing the vision, the SDZ process has drawn on a wide set of new perspectives, aimed at consolidating the platform achieved but also providing a sustainable underpinning for the future. The consolidated Planning Scheme document, incorporating the modifications approved by the City Council on 5 November 2013, together with the further modifications approved by An Bord Pleanala on 16 May 2014, is available on the Dublin Docklands website. On 14 October 2014, it was reported that U2 would buy 16 Hanover Quay from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for €450,000. The authority had forced the band to sell its old riverfront studio on Hanover Quay for an undisclosed price in 2002 to allow development of the Grand Canal Harbour area. As part of that deal the authority had promised the band the top two floors of the 32-storey tower it was planning to build on an adjacent quay, a project that was subsequently put on hold. In light of its imminent dissolution and the recent approval by An Bord Plenala for the North Lotts and Grand Canal Planning scheme, the authority decided it would not be proceeding with a proposed compulsory purchase order of 16 and 18 Hanover Quay. In December 2014 a planning application was submitted for a major commercial and residential development in Dublin's south docklands that is being planned by US investment group Oaktree Capital Management, Irish construction company Bennett and the National Asset Management Agency. The development will comprise 42,500 square metres of offices and apartments at 5 Hanover Quay and 76 Sir John Rogerson's Quay. The construction costs are estimated at €140 million with the project set to accommodate up to 2,400 workers and 158 apartments when fully developed. About 250 workers will be employed during the construction phase of the project, which is expected to have a value of €450 million on completion. A number of site plan notices were posted in the area including the following: *On 4 December 2014, a site plan notice was posted describing the developments to take place at the Boland's Mill site including retaining and restoring old stone buildings to accommodate retail/restaurant/café use, cultural/exhibition use, and residences; and the construction of three new towers (13 to 15 storeys, maximum height 53.65m) to accommodate offices and residences. There will also be three new pedestrian routes from Barrow St., new civic waterfront square adjacent to the dock. *On 12 December 2014, two site plan notices were posted for Targeted Investment Opportunities PLC describing the developments to take place at the former Kilsaran Concrete site at 5 Hanover Quay. One notice is for the construction of a 7-storey office building. The other notice is for the construction of a 7-8-storey building to accommodate residences and mixed-use, including 100 apartments, a leisure centre, and space for 1 retail and 2 cafes at ground level. On 20 March 2015, planning permission was granted for the first planning application under the SDZ scheme. The plans include a development by Targeted Investment Opportunities Plc. at No. 76 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, for a mixed use scheme. The development consists of a 7 to 10 storey structure with 58 apartments and approximately 9,000 sq.m of office space. The development also provided for the new Chocolate Park public open space. =2015-present= Several projects were completed since 2015, including the iconic Central Bank of Ireland headquarters on North Wall Quay. By early 2018, much of the SDZ had been designated for corporate construction. In March 2018, President of the National College of Ireland, Gina Quin complained, stating: \\"less than 1 per cent of the total build space in the North Lotts/Docklands SDZ has been earmarked for social infrastructure, despite the original plan requiring social infrastructure to be delivered for community. That 1 per cent includes premium gyms, crèches and medical centres, providing so-called 'social services' only to those who can afford to pay full commercial rates for them.\\" Plans for a U2 Museum at Hanover Quay approved in early 2018 were later blocked. Controversy In February 2020, the High Court overturned permission granted by An Bord Pleanala for an increase in height of apartments from 7 to 13 stories at a site adjacent to Spencer Dock under development by Spencer Place Development Company and under the control of builder, Johnny Ronan. Dublin City Council had argued that the scheme for the SDZ only allowed heights of up to ten storeys. Crucially, it was also argued that an SDZ can only be amended through a process that includes \\"a fresh round of public consultation\\"; a process that would likely take several years to complete.

It is the 11th ward in Kollam Municipal Corporation, Kerala. Uliyakovil is one of the major contributors to the city's seafood exports. Description Uliyakovil is a neighbourhood of Kollam city that shares its borders with lake Ashtamudi. Previously there were two different municipal councils for this huge area (Uliyakovil West and Uliyakovil East), but they merged and formed a single council in 2005. Some of the major city roads pass through this area. Uliyakovil has a lot of area which looks into the backwaters of Ashtamudi Kayal. The Uliyakovil area once a rural village is soon transforming into an urban area with real estate costs skyrocketing. And with close proximity to hospitals, schools in Kollam city and other main institutions it is back on the map. There was a proposal from Kollam Municipal Corporation and ex-MLA from Kollam constituency, P. K. Gurudasan for the preparation of a detailed project report for the construction of a bypass road connecting the Kollam-Theni National Highway-208 from Kollam city to Kundara via Nair’s Hospital junction, Uliyakovil, Mangad and Thannikkamukku, but the project still has not materialised.

It also put into effect the International Commission for Air Navigation (ICAN). History of the Act The first attempts at international regulation of air navigation were made in 1910 in Paris, when representatives of 19 European countries attended an International Air Conference. The meeting was abandoned when agreement on the contents could not be reached. At a peace conference after World War I the regulation of air navigation was once again discussed. Because of the advances made in aviation during the war, all attending members agreed to hold an International Conference to draw up rules and international regulations for air traffic. On 25 February 1919, an Air Traffic Committee, of 36 states in the British Empire under the Council of Defence met for the first time. The Paris Convention was signed on 13 October 1919, by all attending representatives of the Commonwealth states. Major General Legge, Chairman of the Committee, noted that \\"there should be only one regulatory air authority for Australia, working under a single legislature.\\" At a Premiers’ Conference in May 1920 the Australian Prime Minister W.M. Hughes's recommendation that \\"each State should refer to the Commonwealth the control of air navigation, but in a way as to reserve to the States the right to own and use aircraft for the purpose of government departments and the police powers of the State\\" was carried, and the Commonwealth passed the Air Navigation Act in the widest possible terms. The Air Navigation Act of 1920 was granted assent on 2 December 1920, gazetted on 11 February 1921, came into force on 28 March 1921 and became law on 28 June 1921. Regulations under the Act provided for the registration of aircraft, licensing of aerodromes, licensing of personnel, periodic inspection and maintenance of aircraft, and rules of the air. The Act in use =Britain= The Aviation Security Act 1982 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament which covers offences against the safety of aircraft; protection of aircraft, aerodromes, and air navigation installations against acts of violence; policing of airports; and funding.Aviation Security Act 1982 (c. 36) In addition to murder and conspiracy, the defendants, at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, were accused of breaches of the 1982 Act.

steam locomotives of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The class was designed by William Kirtley and introduced in 1877, intended for the heaviest express services between London and Dover. History William Kirtley took over as locomotive superintendent of the railway following the death of William Martley in 1874. Martley’s Europa class 2-4-0 were performing well on the lightly loaded Dover-Flushing boat trains but a larger engine was required for some of the heavier services on the main line. Kirtley therefore designed a 4-4-0 for this purpose. The six locomotives were built by Neilson and Company of Glasgow and introduced during June and July 1877. They proved to be successful for these tasks and were only superseded on the heaviest trains by the larger M3 class The locomotives passed to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway in 1899 and were considered to be sufficiently useful to be worth re-boilering between 1899 and 1903. The class began to be withdrawn and scrapped from 1911.

The novel has also been published under the title The End of the Battle. Along with the other two novels in the series, it was adapted into a 2001 TV film with Daniel Craig. Sword of Honour Unconditional Surrender is the third novel in Waugh's Sword of Honour series, the author's examination of the Second World War. The novels loosely parallel Waugh's wartime experiences. The title is a reference to the Allied demand for an Unconditional Surrender of the Axis, made in the same period in which the plot is set, but which gets an ironical meaning when applied to the protagonist' tangled personal life. Plot summary Guy Crouchback spends 1941–1943 in Britain, mostly at desk jobs. He turns 40 and, with the German invasion of Russia and Britain's subsequent alliance with the Soviet Union, feels the futility of the war. American soldiers are all over London. Virginia has fallen on hard times and is reduced to selling her furs. She had been persuaded to accompany Trimmer, her former hairdresser who was set up as a war hero for media consumption. She becomes pregnant by him and searches futilely for an abortionist. Eventually she decides to look for a husband instead. Crouchback is chosen for parachute training prior to being sent into action one last time. The commanding officer at the training center is Ludovic. In the previous volume, Officers and Gentlemen, Ludovic had deserted from his unit in Crete, and in the process murdered two men, one while escaping from the island by boat. Crouchback was also on board, and although he was delirious and barely aware of his surroundings, Ludovic fears exposure if the two meet. Already a misfit as an officer, Ludovic becomes increasingly paranoid and isolated. Guy is injured during the parachute training, and finds himself stuck in an RAF medical unit, cut off from anyone he knows. He eventually contacts Jumbo Trotter to extract him and returns to live with his Uncle Peregrine. His father having died, and having left him a significant estate, Guy is now able to support himself comfortably. This attracts the attention of Virginia who begins to visit him. Before Guy goes abroad, he and Virginia are reconciled and remarry (or, in the eyes of the Catholic Church, resume their marriage). Virginia stays in London with his elderly bachelor uncle, Peregrine Crouchback and has her baby there. Despite being incorrectly suspected of pro-Axis sympathies because of his time in pre-war Italy and his Catholicism, Guy is posted to Yugoslavia where he is appalled by the Partisans, befriends a small group of Jews and finds out that his former friend de Souza's loyalties are with Communism rather than with England. While Guy is overseas, a German doodlebug hits Uncle Peregrine's flat and kills him and Virginia, but spares Virginia and Trimmer's son, Gervase, who is in the country with Guy's sister. On his late father's advice, Guy attempts individual acts of salvation, but these ultimately make matters worse for the recipients. The Yugoslavian Jews receive gifts from Jewish organisations in the USA, infuriating the locals, although the gifts consist largely of warm clothes and food. Upon returning to England, Guy is told that some of his friends in Yugoslavia have been shot as spies, largely because of their friendship with him. After the end of the war Guy meets the daughter of another old Roman Catholic family and marries her. In Waugh's first version of the novel's conclusion, Guy and his second wife produce further children who are ironically to be disinherited by Trimmer's son. Waugh altered this ending to an uncompromisingly childless marriage in the revised text, after realising that some readers interpreted such a conclusion as hopeful. \\"No nippers for Guy,\\" he clarified in a letter to Nancy Mitford. Nonetheless, Waugh died in 1966 and, in the 1974 Penguin reprint, the character has two sons with his wife Domenica Plessington.

The station was situated on the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) Audley branch line. The Audley line ran from a junction on the Stoke to Crewe line near to a junction between and on the Stoke to Market Drayton Line Like many of the lines opened by the NSR the Audley line was built primarily to carry mineral traffic. The line opened in 1870 but passenger services were not introduced until 1880, partially a wait caused by the need to build a junction from the Audley line that would allow trains to run directly towards Stoke rather than having to reverse at the junction which was how the line was originally constructed. The decision to introduce passenger trains over the line led to the opening of a station to serve the mining village of Halmer End in June 1880. By 1923 the station had a good passenger service, for a small country station, with six services a day in each direction from , three terminating at Halmerend and the others continuing to . Good as the passenger service was the rise in bus services led to a decline in the revenue raised from passengers and in 1931 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway withdrew all passenger services on the Audley line from 27 April 1931. Freight traffic too had been diminished by the economic depression towards the end of the 1920s and many of the local collieries closed as they became worked out or uneconomic to maintain and the line was reduced to a single line in 1933 although freight services continued until complete closure of the line through Halmerend in June 1962.

Route The northern terminus was near the silos at left of picture. The Waikerie railway line branched from the Barmera railway line at Karoonda, which was also the junction for the Peebinga railway line on the other side of the main line. It extended north, north-east, and north again to Waikerie, on the cliffs above the Murray River. History Before construction started on the Waikerie railway, there was active discussion about where it should branch from the Barmera or Adelaide-Wolseley line. Eventually, the decision was made that it should branch from Karoonda at the 30-mile siding from Tailem Bend. Other possible branching points at that stage included the 40-mile (Borrika) and 58½ miles (Mindarie) from Tailem Bend. There was also a proposal to branch from the 20-mile mark (Wynarka). The line opened on 23 September 1914. The Waikerie line was part of a significant expansion of the railways in South Australia in the early part of the 20th century to facilitate greater development of the rural areas of the state. The estimated cost of the Karoonda-Waikerie line, including rolling stock, was £251,350, with expected revenue of £10,000 per annum, working expenses of £10,820, and interest costs of £10,054. It was anticipated by the Railways Commissioner that the loss here would be £10,874 per annum. The area to be served was estimated at . The contract for the first was accepted for £16,220 in January 1914. The Galga to Waikerie section closed on 14 March 1990, followed by the Karoonda-Galga section on 4 March 1994.

Directed by Alex Gibney and produced by HBO, it is based on Lawrence Wright's book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief (2013). The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. It received widespread praise from critics and was nominated for seven Emmy Awards, winning three, including Best Documentary. It also received a 2015 Peabody Award and won the award for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. The film deconstructs the church's claims by presenting a condensed history of Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, examining how celebrities interact with the church, and highlighting the stories of a number of ex-members and of the abuse and exploitation that they described seeing and experiencing. The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees. Going Clear was released in a limited number of theaters on March 13, 2015, and aired on HBO on March 29, 2015. It was a major ratings success and by mid-April 2015 had attracted 5.5 million viewers, making it the second most-watched HBO documentary in the past decade. It was subsequently released internationally, showing in theaters and on television despite a sustained campaign by the Church of Scientology to block its release.  Synopsis  Going Clear is based closely on Lawrence Wright's book, covering much of the same ground with the aid of archive footage, dramatic reconstructions, and interviews with eight former Scientologists: Paul Haggis, an Oscar-winning film director; Mark Rathbun, the church's former second-in-command; Mike Rinder, the former head of the church's Office of Special Affairs; actor Jason Beghe; Sylvia \\"Spanky\\" Taylor, former liaison to John Travolta; and former Scientologists Tom DeVocht, Sara Goldberg, and Hana Eltringham Whitfield. The film breaks into three distinct acts. In the first, the former Scientologists describe how they joined Scientology; the second act recounts the history of Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard; and in the final act, the film airs allegations of the abuse of church members and misconduct by its leadership, particularly David Miscavige, who is accused of intimidating, beating, imprisoning, and exploiting subordinates. The film depicts the role played by celebrity members, such as Travolta and Tom Cruise, through video clips contrasting their statements with the experiences of former Scientologists. To support its thesis, the film utilises footage of ex-Scientologists harassed and surveilled (per Hubbard's dictum that the church's critics were all criminals whose crimes needed to be exposed), and describes the imprisonment of senior Scientology executives in a facility known as \\"The Hole\\"; one Scientologist was said to have been forced to clean a bathroom with his tongue. According to the film, actress Nicole Kidman was targeted for wiretapping by Scientology in an effort to break her marriage to Tom Cruise after she was labeled a \\"potential trouble source\\" by the church; whereas Travolta has been forced to stay in the church in fear that secrets from his personal life will be exposed.  Development  Alex Gibney, director of Going Clear The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Lawrence Wright's book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief, which was published in January 2013 and was a National Book Award finalist. HBO announced in December 2014 that Alex Gibney, an Oscar-winning director who made Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room (2005), Taxi to the Dark Side, (2007) and The Armstrong Lie (2013), was directing a film based on the book, to be released at the 2015 Sundance Festival. It was the first time that HBO had tackled Scientology directly, though not the first time it had clashed with the church; in 1998, protesters mounted demonstrations outside HBO's headquarters because of a documentary that presented anti-depressant drugs, which are fiercely opposed by Scientology, in a positive light. Gibney began working on Going Clear in 2013 after becoming intrigued by Wright's book. He collaborated with Wright, who came on board as a producer, to explore the book's underlying theme of \\"how people become prisoners of faith in various ways\\". Gibney saw Scientology as one of the toughest subjects he has had to tackle in his career as a documentarian, alongside government complicity in torture, corporate financial malfeasance, and clerical sexual abuse. Fear of Scientology's litigiousness rendered American networks unwilling to license any material to the filmmakers, which Gibney found \\"astounding\\". He commented that he \\"found it interesting that universally this subject — more than any other — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I think at the end of the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism.\\" The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: \\"Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house.\\" Explaining why he chose to make a film about Scientology, Gibney told Reuters that he considered it \\"an important topic. Not only about this church of Scientology, which everybody's fascinated with partially because of the celebrities, but partially because of the way that the church seems to turn people to do things that I think they would normally never do if had they not entered the church.\\" Gibney, Wright, and the former Scientologists who appeared in the film told a post-screening question-and-answer session that they hoped the film would raise public awareness about the alleged abuses committed by the Church of Scientology, and would prompt the media and law enforcement agencies to investigate further. Gibney later called in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece for Scientology's tax exemption to be revoked in the light of the allegations of abuse documented in the film. Distribution and screenings =United States= Going Clear made its world première on January 25, 2015, at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The Wall Street Journal described it as \\"the hottest ticket\\" at the festival. The première was so popular that even those with tickets were unable to find seats, because so many VIP pass-holders chose to watch the film, displacing ordinary festival-goers. It attracted numerous celebrities and media figures, including actors Alec Baldwin and Tobey Maguire, comedian Jason Sudeikis, and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. The audience gave Going Clear a standing ovation in an unusual occurrence for a Sundance presentation. 'Spanky' Taylor's appearance on stage, along with the daughter from whom the church had forced her to \\"disconnect\\", reduced many in the audience to tears. The film was subsequently shown in a limited number of New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco theaters from March 13, 2015. The initial theatrical release was deliberately small-scale, most likely undertaken to ensure that Going Clear met the eligibility criteria for an Oscar nomination. Due to continuing public demand, HBO announced in July 2015 that it would be releasing the film more widely from September 25 through the ArcLight Cinemas chain's theaters in California, Chicago, Washington D.C., New York City, Texas and a few other locations around the US. HBO broadcast the television première of Going Clear on March 29, 2015. It was the network's most successful documentary premiere since 2006, attracting 1.7 million viewers. 5.5 million viewers were reported to have watched it within only two weeks of its TV première, making it the second most successful HBO documentary in the past decade after a 2013 film on the singer Beyoncé. Vimeo has acquired the US rights for online distribution from September 2015. =International= The film sold worldwide but was scheduled only for non-theatrical release in most countries. The Church of Scientology undertook an intensive campaign to block its release internationally. According to Alex Gibney, \\"Every step of the way, every distributor, every festival has received multiple threatening letters from the Church of Scientology. Some have come very close to buckling.\\" The Sydney Film Festival was among those threatened but the screening of Going Clear went ahead; Gibney declared himself to be \\"delighted with the way the Australians handled it.\\" However, Australian airline Qantas, which employs Scientologist John Travolta as an ambassador, was reported to have refused to show the film on its aircraft. The film was shown in Denmark on DR2 as Scientologys religiøse fængsel, on April 21, 2015,Kontroversiel film om Scientology i 'DR2 Dokumania', DR in Sweden on SVT1 as Fångade av scientologin on May 19,Fångade av scientologin, SVT and by VPRO in the Netherlands on NPO 2 on May 19.going clear: scientology & the prison of belief , VPRO It was released in Italy as Going Clear: Scientology e la prigione della fede on June 25. Sky Atlantic, a co-distributor of the film, along with HBO Documentary Films, originally planned to broadcast Going Clear in the UK and Ireland soon after its US TV première. However, this was stalled due to potential legal problems. Because Northern Ireland is not subject to the Defamation Act 2013, which reformed the libel laws in other parts of the UK, and because Sky cannot differentiate its signal between regions, the film may be subject to legal challenge in Northern Ireland. The Church of Scientology successfully blocked the publication or distribution of the original book Going Clear in the UK and Ireland and indicated a willingness to sue broadcasters, saying in a statement that it \\"will be entitled to seek the protection of both UK and Irish libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions.\\" The film eventually received a low-key release in June 2015 in 18 theaters in England and Scotland. It was broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, on September 21, 2015, and attracted 88,000 overnight viewers. By the start of October it had become Sky's most-watched documentary for three years, attracting a peak audience of 313,000 viewers and an average of 243,000 including catchup viewing. Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes collected 87 reviews as of September 24, 2015, of which 94% were positive. The site's consensus states: \\"Thoroughly disquieting but impossible to ignore, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a searing investigative work from a master documentarian.\\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 80/100 based on 11 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Variety's chief film critic, Scott Foundas, praised the level of detail in Going Clear and called it a \\"powder-keg\\" documentary that illustrates \\"the dangers of blind faith.\\" Lesley Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter characterized it as an \\"impeccably assembled and argued film\\" that \\"represents a brave, timely intervention into debates around the organization that have been simmering for some time.\\" Slate called the film \\"a stunning exposé of an organization and religion too long shrouded in mystery.\\" Screen Daily's Anthony Kaufman felt that some of the re-enactments in the film were \\"heavy-handed or sensationalistic,\\" but commended it overall as \\"a serious, strange and unsettling account of brainwashing, greed and gross misuses of power.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Brian Moylan described Going Clear as \\"entertaining and dismaying viewing\\" in which \\"the story of Scientology, with all its strange players, emerges as comedy, rather than horror,\\" but criticised its reliance on a small group of defectors and the lack of any involvement by the church. He felt that this made the film \\"a bit one-sided\\" and that it was \\"easy to be skeptical about some of the more outlandish claims made by former members.\\" Sasha Bronner of the Huffington Post called the film a \\"shocking and eye-opening\\" work that would leave those who did not know much about Scientology \\"spellbound.\\" The BBC's Owen Gleiberman praised it as \\"the most exciting – and disturbing – work of cinematic non-fiction in a long time\\" and awarded Going Clear five stars, describing it as having \\"the scary intensity of a thriller.\\" Following the initial HBO broadcast of Going Clear, Saturday Night Live aired a music video featuring the \\"Church of Neurotology\\", a parody of Scientology's 1990 music video \\"We Stand Tall\\", clips from which were shown in the documentary. =Awards and nominations= Going Clear received a total of seven nominations for the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards. The film was nominated in the categories for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special, Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming, Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming, Sound Editing for Nonfiction Programming (single or multi-camera) and Sound Mixing for Nonfiction Programming (single or multi- camera). Alex Gibney also received two nominations for Writing for Nonfiction Programming and Direction for Nonfiction Programming. The film won in three Emmy categories: Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special, Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming. Gibney praised the \\"courageous support\\" of HBO executives and the \\"courage of witnesses who stood up against ... the human rights abuses\\" of Scientology. He suggested that a sequel to Going Clear might be in the works: \\"There's a lot more material already that I've received, more to come out — and so far the IRS has not revoked its [tax-exemption] protection so there’s a lot more to be done.\\". On December 1, the film was selected as one of 15 shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. It also won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay in 2015, and won a 2015 George Foster Peabody Award, presented at the 2016 awards ceremony.  Scientology reaction  The Church of Scientology stood in strong opposition to the film. Ten days before the film's premiere, the Church of Scientology took out full-page advertisements in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times to denounce Going Clear, comparing it to the story \\"A Rape on Campus\\" published by Rolling Stone magazine. Gibney subsequently said that he was grateful for the church's advertising, as it had attracted much publicity for the film; he only wished \\"they'd put in showtimes.\\" The head of HBO Documentary Films, Sheila Nevins, commented that when she saw the advertisements she knew that Going Clear would be a big success: \\"Docs don’t get full page ads, and when they do, they do really well.\\" The church also published a \\"special report\\" attacking the film on one of its websites, started a new Twitter account which claimed to be \\"taking a resolute stand against the broadcasting and publishing of false information\\" and bought numerous ads around Google search results relating to the film in order to direct searchers to its anti-Going Clear pages. Additionally, the church posted a series of short films on its website attacking the filmmakers and their interviewees, with titles such as \\"Alex Gibney Documentary 'Going Clear' Propaganda,\\" \\"Marty Rathbun: A Violent Psychopath,\\" \\"Mike Rinder: The Wife Beater,\\" \\"Sara Goldberg: The Home Wrecker\\" and \\"Paul Haggis: The Hypocrite of Hollywood.\\" The church complained that Gibney had declined to interview 25 of its members whom it had put forward to him. According to Gibney, Miscavige, Travolta, and Cruise all declined interviews. Instead the church offered \\"a delegation of 25 unidentified individuals, presumably to smear the people in our film,\\" which did not interest him. The church also denounced the film's interviewees as \\"the usual collection of obsessive, disgruntled former Church members kicked out as long as 30 years ago for malfeasance, who have a documented history of making up lies about the Church for money.\\" =Campaign against film interviewees and critics= According to Gibney, the church mounted an \\"organized\\" and \\"brutal\\" response to the appearance of its former members in the film: \\"Some of them have had physical threats, people threatening to take their homes away, private investigators following them. That's the part that's really heartbreaking.\\" In March 2015, a New York private investigator named Eric Saldarriaga pleaded guilty to the federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer hacking after he illegally gained access to at least 60 email accounts on behalf of undisclosed clients, one of the main ones reportedly being \\"someone who has done investigations on behalf of the Church of Scientology.\\" Among those targeted were Mike Rinder and the journalist Tony Ortega, both interviewees in the film. The names of Saldarriaga's clients were not revealed and prosecutors declined to pursue action against anyone else, citing a lack of evidence. A few weeks after the film's TV première, Paul Haggis reported that a suspected Scientology spy posing as a reporter for Time had attempted to interview him in a possible attempt to obtain material to use against him; the Church denied the claim. Tony Ortega and another interviewee in the film, former Scientologist Marc Headley, reported that investigators from the church had surveilled them at Salt Lake City airport as they made their way to the Sundance Film Festival. The church contacted film critics complaining that their reviews of Going Clear were \\"filled with bald faced lies\\" and demanding that the critics should publish a church statement rebutting the film. Jason Bailey of Flavorwire wrote that \\"pretty much every critic who wrote about Going Clear\\" received an email from Scientology spokesperson Karin Pouw. He commented that the church did not seem to realise that film critics do not usually try to interview people for reviews, and noted how neatly it \\"comports with the film's portrayal of the Church as a hive of shady, paranoid control freaks.\\" In an email to Flavorwire, Gibney observed that \\"anytime someone writes something – film criticism or social criticism – about Scientology, the Church of Scientology counter-attacks by smearing critics.\\" Indiewire's Max O'Connell criticised the church's approach for being counterproductive. He predicted that \\"their campaign against the film is going to be the best publicity that Alex Gibney and company could ever hope for, if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and (this is no small thing) a nightmare for the ex-CoS members who dared to speak out against the Church's practices. But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a lot of good for your image.\\" Paul Haggis, who was labeled \\"doughy\\" and \\"pasty\\" by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: \\"You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?\\" The filmmakers reported receiving \\"lots of cards and letters\\" from the church, though in their case it had limited its response to \\"loads of legal paperwork\\". HBO had earlier said that it had put \\"probably 160 lawyers\\" onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church. Sheila Nevins of HBO commented that she could not believe how aggressive the church had been. Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film, but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film: \\"I thought, 'They really don't want us to do it. All the reason more to do it.'\\" =Campaign to influence Oscar awards= Following the film's success at the Emmys, the church was reported to have mounted an aggressive campaign to deny it recognition at the Oscars. The church's campaign included producing an anti-Gibney film and approaches to members of the Academy's documentary branch, responsible for selecting contenders for the awards. Several members of the documentary branch reported receiving approaches from the Church's magazine Freedom in connection with a planned profile of Gibney. Although the Church denied that its actions had anything to do with the Oscars, Lawrence Wright suggested that its \\"more feverish attention to the documentary\\" had to do with it feeling \\"threatened by the possibility that [the Hollywood] community would examine the church more closely\\" as the Oscars approached. In January 2016, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the film and Gibney were reported to have been “snubbed” by Oscar voters and not included in the Best Documentary category of the 88th Academy Awards.

It is found in clear, fast-moving streams and tributaries of the Mekong, Nam Xam, Da and Chao Phraya river basins in Indochina. S. acanthopterus is most commonly found in waterways with a rocky bottom and under complete tree cover. Taxonomy The original description of this fish is attributed to Fowler in 1934, although he originally assigned the name Scaphiodontopsis acanthopterus. The genus name of Scaphiodonichtys is from the Greek (boat), (teeth), (fish). Disttibution, habitat & ecology S. acanthopterus is found in the South-East Asian countries of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam as well in Yunnan, China. It inhabits several river basins, including the Mekong, Chao Phraya, Nam Theun, and Xe Bangfai, mostly living in smaller tributaries and streams with clear, fast moving water, and a rocky bottom. This fish has been documented between 300 and 2500 meters above sea level (980 to 8200 feet). It is normally found in streams under the shade of a complete forest canopy. S. acanthopterus feeds largely on periphyton on rocky surfaces but also on insect larvae and a small amount of detritus. It seems to breed immediately following the end of the rainy season as the water levels in the upland areas have fallen with juveniles appearing in catches during April. Human interactions S. acanthopterus is consumed locally and is seasonally recorded in small local markets. It is potentially threatened by deforestation, pollution and overfishing but the population appears to be stable and it is common in some protected areas.

Her father, Alisdair Macdonald, was a respected photojournalist who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2007. Having been a falconer for many years, she purchased a young goshawk to help her through the grieving process.

In an interview with The Guardian, Macdonald said, \\"While the backbone of the book is a memoir about that year when I lost my father and trained a hawk, there are also other things tangled up in that story which are not memoir. There is the shadow biography of TH White, and a lot of nature- writing, too.

Further work included building the facades for 37 hobbit holes and associated gardens and hedges, a mill and double arch bridge, and erecting a oak above Bag End that had been growing near Matamata and which was cut down and recreated on site complete with artificial leaves.

She sank on September 8, 1874, and is generally considered the first shipwreck in the Chequamegon Bay area of Lake Superior. History During the early part of the 1870s Ashland was a small settlement, surrounded by a heavily wooded wilderness. Seeing the potential to make money in the future logging activity of the area, W.R. Sutherland founded the Ashland Lumber Company, the first sawmill in Ashland. (Note: this company should not be confused with a later business of the same name, of which Sutherland was not involved.) A good portion of Sutherland's business consisted of transporting lumber to Isle Royale, which had no sawmill of its own. The D.R. Owen was leased to transport lumber to the island. On the morning of Thursday, September 6, 1874, the Owen left the island after delivering a load of lumber. However, an extremely rough storm was soon encountered. Poor visibility, strong winds and rough waters proved to be very difficult for the crew. A leak was discovered in the hull, and the sails were completely wrecked by the violent winds. The crew attempted to wait out the storm. Friday, September 7, came and went with little change in the stormy conditions. Finally, on Saturday morning, September 8, land appeared on the horizon. The Apostle Islands were spotted, meaning the storm at least had blown the water-logged ship in the right direction. By that afternoon, the ship reached an area east of Ashland, near the mouth of the Bad River, where she sank. The crew survived.

Built in 1890, it is one of Fairfield's finest Queen Anne Victorian houses. It was built by Joseph Cotton, owner of the Maine Manufacturing Company, which produced iceboxes, and occupied by him for just four years. The house was acquired in 1983 by the Fairfield Historical Society, which operates it as the Fairfield History House, a museum of local history. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Cotton-Smith House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, set on a granite and brick foundation on a sloping lot in a residential area near Fairfield's town center. It has a truncated hip roof with slate shingles, and several large gable projections. The front (west-facing) facade has two sections: the left side has a round-arch three-part window with a pair of sash windows above, and the right, which projects slight, rises to a full-height gable, has a polygonal window bay topped by a hip roof with a small gable, a pair of sash windows above, and smaller windows in the gable. The gable is decorated with wooden panels that have intricate sawn details. The south elevation, where the main entrance is located, has a projecting section near its center, with a single-story porch running forward from that projection, supported by turned posts and balustrade. Behind the house stands a matching carriage house, which is gambrel-roofed and rests on a brick foundation. It has the same basic design features as the house. The house's interior follows a side hall plan, with the hall on the building's south side. To the northwest is a passage decorated with turned wood columns leading to the dining room and sitting room, with the parlor in the southwestern corner. A small study is located in the southeast, with the kitchen and pantry area to the northeast. The sitting room and parlor are decorated with distinctive stencilwork, dating to the early 20th century, in the cornices. The house was built in 1890 by Joseph Cotton, although it was apparently not quite complete when he sold it in 1894. Cotton was locally notable as the owner of the Maine Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of iceboxes. Cotton moved from Fairfield to Nashua, New Hampshire, selling the house to John Smith, a local carpenter. The house remained in the Smith family until 1983, when his daughter-in-law sold it to the Fairfield Historical Society. The society uses the property as a museum and for meetings and events.

It supersedes XPath 1.0 and XPath 2.0. XPath 3.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 8 April 2014, while XPath 3.1 became a W3C Recommendation on 21 March 2017.  New features in XPath 3.0  Compared to XPath 2.0, XPath 3.0 adds the following new features: ; Inline function expressions : Anonymous functions can be created in an expression context. For example, the expression \`function($a as xs:double, $b as xs:double) as xs:double { $a * $b }\` creates a function that returns the product of its two arguments. The expression \`collection()/(let $a := . return function() { $a })\` creates a sequence of functions, each one returning a different node from a collection. ; Dynamic function calls : Function values may be called without being referenced by name. For example, \`$f[2](\\"Hi there\\")\` fetches the second item from sequence \`$f\`, and invokes it as a function, passing the string \`\\"Hi there\\"\` as argument. ; Union types : Union types, as defined in XML Schema, may be used in type conversions and function type signatures. ; Namespace literals : XML namespaces may be referenced using braced URI literals. For example, the qualified name \`math:pi\` may be expanded to \`Q{http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math}pi\`, embedding the namespace URI inside the prefix. ; String concatenation operator : The new \`\` operator may be used for string concatenation: \`$a  $b\` is equivalent to \`fn:concat($a, $b)\`. ; Mapping operator : The new \`!\` operator performs simple mapping: \`E1 ! E2\` evaluates \`E2\` for each item in the sequence \`E1\`, and concatenates the resulting items. This is comparable to the path operator \`/\`, but the \`!\` operator does not perform duplicate elimination and document ordering of the results.  New features in XPath 3.1  XPath 3.1 mainly adds support for array and map (associative array) data types. These types and their associated functionality are intended to ease working with JSON data. Another innovation is the arrow operator \`=>\` for function chaining. For example, the XPath 2.0 expression :\`contains(upper-case(substring-before($in, ' ')), 'X')\` can now be written :\`$in => substring-before(' ') => upper-case() => contains('X')\`  References  * * Category:XML data access ","title":"XPath 3"},{"id":"45237795","text":"Campeggio may refer to: *Lorenzo Campeggio (1474–1539), Italian cardinal and politician *Alessandro Campeggio (1504–1554), Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal ","title":"Campeggio"},{"id":"45237837","text":"Tor sinensis, the Chinese or Red mahseer is a species of mahseer native to the Mekong River. It is known with certainty only from Yunnan, China; reports from Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand require confirmation. It is one of four currently valid species described from China, the others being Tor laterivittatus (dark-striped mahseer), Tor polylepis (multi-scaled mahseer), and Tor yingjiangensis (Yingjiang mahseer).  Description  Tor sinensis grows to in standard length. Juveniles are silvery, but adults and subadults have a deep, dark midlateral stripe. The body is darkish above and brownish beneath. Pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins are deep red. Maurice Kottelat is among those who claim that insufficient work has been done on establishing specimens from confirmed species populations when identifying mahseer species.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maurice_Kottelat/publication/270508449_Notes_on_taxonomy_nomenclature_and_distribution_of_some_fishes_of_Laos/links/54af06070cf2b48e8ed5001d/Notes- on-taxonomy-nomenclature-and-distribution-of-some-fishes-of-Laos.pdf This is common across the species of Southeast Asia in particular, and includes claimed distinctions between Tor sinensis and Tor laterivattatus. Huang et al. claim to have determined the complete mitochondrial genome of Tor sinensis, which, if the species identification is correct, will be a useful tool in establishing identities of the mahseers of this region.  Habitat and ecology Tor sinensis is found in larger streams and rivers in clear gravel and cobble beds. They are migratory and omnivorous, feeding on plant material (including fruits), fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. Conservation This species is currently assigned as Vulnerable by the IUCN. As with many other species of mahseer, a major constraining factor in any conservation strategy is the relative lack of understanding of the distribution and ecology of the species and how or if it interacts with other local mahseer species within the same habitat. With other mahseer species, the main threats are: loss of habitat due to urbanisation, encroachment on flood plains, dam building, sand extraction and pollution. Destructive fishing methods like dynamite, poisoning and electricity are in common use throughout Southeast Asia, and may be expected to be a major threat to the sustainability of populations. It is reported that the fragmentation of the various populations within the wider Mekong River basin is a threat to genetic variability. This will have long term implications for conservation, due to the threat of inbreeding. Uses Tor sinensis is caught in local subsistence fisheries.

Facing accusations, he left his office and retired to a monastery, but remained a confidante of the emperor, for whom he undertook a delicate diplomatic mission to Bulgaria in 929. He is likely to be identified as one of the conspirators who in 947 intended to depose Constantine VII and restore Romanos I's son Stephen Lekapenos to the throne.  Life  solidus of Romanos I with Constantine VII John is first mentioned in 922, in the aftermath of a failed conspiracy against emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (reigned 920–944) and his junior colleague Constantine VII (r. 913–959). At the time, he was a presbyter, held the title of rhaiktor, and was the chief councillor (paradynasteuon) to Romanos I. In the aftermath of the conspiracy's revelation by the servant of one of the conspirators, he took the servant into the imperial household. In addition, he argued successfully for the promotion of Constantine Lorikatos, the protokarabos (captain of the imperial dromon) and loyal partisan of Romanos, to the post of protospatharios tes phiales, which had been held until then by one of the men implicated in the conspiracy. In spring of 922 he was sent, along with the admiral Alexios Mosele, the Domestic of the Schools Pothos Argyros, and his brother Leo Argyros, to confront a Bulgarian invasion. In the ensuing Battle of Pegae near Constantinople, John fled the field almost immediately and sought refuge aboard a nearby warship, while the battle resulted in a rout for the Byzantines, who lost many men and officers, both dead and captive. Shortly afterwards, unspecified charges were brought against him before Emperor Romanos. Feigning illness, he left the imperial palace and retired to a monastery he had founded, near Galakrenai. He was succeeded as paradynasteuon by John Mystikos. Despite the accusations and his becoming a monk, John seems to have retained Romanos' confidence, for probably in 929 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Bulgaria. Officially his mission was to reconcile Tsar Peter (r. 927–969) with his younger brother Ivan, who had unsuccessfully revolted against him and had been forced to become a monk, but in reality he was to bring Ivan to Constantinople. As soon as Ivan was in Constantinople, he abandoned his monastic habit and married a Byzantine noblewoman. John and Romanos' eldest son and co-emperor Christopher Lekapenos (r. 921–931) were witnesses at the ceremony. John is probably to be identified with John the Rhaiktor who in December 947 was part of a failed conspiracy to depose Constantine VII, now sole emperor, and restore Romanos' younger son Stephen Lekapenos to the throne. The conspirators were variously blinded, their ears and noses cut, publicly humiliated through the streets of the capital, and exiled.

It is located in an architecturally distinctive yet diminutive Craftsman building, designed by John W. Merrow and built in 1919–20, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The library is open four days a week. Architecture and history The early history of library services in East Blue Hill is obscure, starting (according to local lore) with an organization of \\"Willing Workers\\" that amassed a small collection of books. The campaign to build the present building was begun in 1914 with the acquisition of land, with major fundraising undertaken in 1917. The building, completed in 1920, is based on a design sketched by John W. Merrow, a New York City theatrical architect. The building is a small single- story square wood frame structure, with a hip roof, granite foundation, weatherboard siding, and a stone chimney at one side. The main entrance (on the north facade) is sheltered by a porch, which has shingled posts and an elaborate framework supporting an eyelid-shaped roof. To the right of the porch is a bank of three six-over-one sash windows. The building's interior is roughly divided into three functional areas: at the entrance is a vestibule area, with a fireplaced reading room to the right, and a room of stacks behind. The stack room consists of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelving. All of the interior trim is painted except for the doors.

The record of her trial is the earliest record of trial and execution on charges of witchcraft in Wales. She was first accused of Witchcraft in 1594. She was found guilty and hanged before the year's end.  Early years  Gwen ferch Ellis was born in the parish of Llandyrnog in . Her parents' names are not recorded, other than her father's Christian name, Ellis. At a young age she was sent to live with her uncle Harry ap Roger and remained in his care until she married.  Marriages  Gwen was married three times in total. Her first husband, Lewis ap David ap Gwyn, died after two years of marriage. In 1588 she married a miller called Lewis ap David ap Gruffith Gethin (Lewis Gethin). The couple moved to his mill at Llanelian-yn-Rhos. After just 18 months of marriage, her second husband also died. In 1592, Gwen married John ap Morrice from the neighbouring parish of Betws yn Rhos and settled there. The fate of her third husband is unknown, although he was not mentioned during her trial.  Accusation  Gwen enters the historical record in 1594 when she was examined by William Hughes (Bishop of St Asaph), on suspicion of charming. The records of the examination reveal that Gwen made her living by spinning and making linen cloth. She explained that she was also a healer. She made salves and plasters and other remedies for the treatment of animals. This she did in return for small gifts of food or goods. She also attended the sick, including children and, so she stated, had been using charms to help heal and provide protection. = The charm = The use of verbal or written charms was not uncommon in Wales and other parts of Great Britain, but the particular case in which Gwen was implicated stood out for several reasons. A written charm was found at the home of Thomas Mostyn, one of the foremost gentleman of north Wales. The charm was also written backwards, which, according to the traditions of the time, meant that it was intended as a destructive spell rather than one for healing. Gwen was implicated because of her association with Jane Conway of Marle, near Conwy, who seems to have had some quarrel with Mostyn.  Trial and execution  Following her examination by the bishop, local magistrates were given the power to examine witnesses willing to testify against Gwen. Five men and two women came forward with accusations of witchcraft against her. She was accused of causing the madness of a child, and of murdering a sick man who died shortly after being treated by Gwen. She was also accused of having a vengeful nature, all through the use of witchcraft. Later in 1594, Gwen was tried on these charges and found guilty. She was executed by hanging in Denbigh town square before the end of the year.  References   External links  *Gwen Ferch Ellis (1542–1594).

Until her retirement in 2002 she specialized in women's studies, Jewish women's studies and lesbian studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. Beck has published a number of essays and books on Judaism. She came to wider prominence in 1982 with her book, Nice Jewish Girls: A Lesbian Anthology, a compilation of poems, essays, reminiscences and short stories, believed to be the first published collection of works by lesbian Jewish women in the United States.  Biography  = Provenance and early years = Evelyn Torton was born into a Jewish family in Vienna. Max Torton, her father, came originally from Buchach, a small town which at that time would have been regarded as Polish. (Since 1944 it has been in Western Ukraine.) Her mother, born Irma Lichtmann, was from Vienna. Politics in Austria became increasingly polarised during the 1930s, and around the time of Evelyn's birth the country became a one-party dictatorship. The Austrian government came increasingly under German influence. Following Austria's integration into an enlarged Germany in March 1938 antisemitism became a mainstream element of government policy: in 1938 Max Torton was arrested and taken to the Dachau concentration camp. The rest of family were obliged to leave their Vienna apartment and move into a ghetto. Here they lived with other families in a multi-occupancy apartment. By 1939 Max Torton had been transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp, and then released under circumstances that never became clear. That year six year old Evelyn, together with her parents and her younger brother Edgar, fled to Italy where the family settled for a couple of months in Milan. It was only possible to obtain four visas, and they had to leave Evelyn's maternal grandmother, who had always lived with the family, behind in Vienna. She would later be deported by the Nazi authorities and murdered. By the time she reached New York with her parents in June 1940 she was seven. Her father told her that theirs had been the last emigrant ship permitted to leave Italy for the United States. Her younger brother Edgar had remained in Europe, but he would survive the Holocaust and emigrate to New York after the war. Evelyn grew up in Brooklyn in a working-class neighborhood. Her father, who had owned his own business in Vienna, now worked in a factory owned by a relative. Here he met up with other Yiddish speaking race-exiles. Evelyn's mother was not able to settle to their new life so quickly. When news came through of her own mother's murder she suffered a nervous breakdown. Meanwhile, Evelyn joined Hashomer Hatzair, a Socialist-Zionist, secular Jewish youth movement which at the time was strongly focused on preparing young people for emigration to Palestine. In an interview given in 2001 she said that the pioneering spirit and shared objectives which she experienced as a member of Hashomer Hatzair, together with the comradeship and the sense of belonging, did much to form her. She was also impressed by the way that within the movement women and men all did the same work. = Student years = Evelyn Torton Beck studied comparative literature and received her BA (first degree) from Brooklyn College in 1954, which was also the year of her first marriage. The next year she received her MA from Yale. Her doctorate from the University of Wisconsin–Madison would follow in 1969. Her doctoral dissertation concerned Franz Kafka and the influence of Yiddish theatre on his work. = The educator = Starting in 1972 Beck spent twelve years teaching Comparative Literature, German, and Women’s Studies at the University of Wisconsin, becoming an associate professor in 1977 and promoted to a full professorship in 1982. Her study of Kafka for her doctorate had led her to a deepening interest in Jewish literary and cultural heritage more generally. Adumbrating later trends, in 1972 she founded a section for Yiddish in the Modern Language Association, then as now the principal professional association in the United States for scholars of language and literature. She introduced Jewish topics and writers, such as Sholem Aleichem, to her teaching program. She translated into English works by Isaac Bashevis Singer (who always wrote in Yiddish). One slightly unexpected product of her work with Singer was her essay, \\"The Many Faces of Eve: Women, Yiddish, and Isaac Bashevis Singer\\" (1982). In the context of what was coming to be defined as second-wave feminism she was one of the first to call for \\"lesbian inclusion in Jewish circles and for Jewish inclusion in feminist circles\\". She complained that antisemitism was not taken seriously either among feminist activists or among lesbian activists.Joyce Antler: Radical Feminism and Jewish Women, in: Hasia R. Diner, Shira M. Kohn, Rachel Kranson: A Jewish Feminine Mystique? Jewish Women in Postwar America, Rutgers University Press 2010, , pp. 227–228 In 1982 she published \\"Nice Jewish Girls: A Lesbian Anthology\\", a compilation of poems, essays, reminiscences and short stories. A theme of the book is the painful experiences of Jewish lesbians coming up against antisemitism in society, even among lesbian feminists. At the same time the volume proudly celebrates the creative force which the contributing authors can call upon from their own Jewish witness.Jeffrey S. Gurock: American Jewish Life, 1920-1990. American Jewish History, Routledge 1997, , p. 16 In 1984 she returned to the East Coast, accepting an invitation to create and then head up the Institute for Gender studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. She also became an associate member of the Faculty for Jewish Studies and Comparative Literature. Retirement of a kind came in 2002, since when she has been Professor Emerita at the University of Maryland and an Alum Research Fellow with the Creative Longevity and Wisdom Initiative at Fielding Graduate University. Evelyn Torton Beck collected material for a book on the theme \\"Wounds of Gender: Frida Kahlo and Franz Kafka\\" over many years. She received a second doctorate in 2004, this time in Clinical Psychology from Fielding Graduate University in California. The qualification was awarded for an interdisciplinary dissertation under the title \\"Physical Illness, Psychological Woundedness and the Healing Power of Art in the Life and Work of Franz Kafka and Frida Kahlo\\". Summarized by one commentator, \\"the thesis focuses on the Jewish dimension of [Kafka's and Kahlo's] work and its impact on their split sense of self\\". The work earned her the Frieda Fromm- Reichmann Award for schizophrenia research. A recurring theme of her academic career has been the creation of numerous interdisciplinary courses on topics such as Women in the Arts, Mothers and Daughters, Jewish Women in International Perspective, Women and the Holocaust, Death and Dying in Modern Literature, Lesbian Studies, Gender, Power and the Spectrum of Difference, Healing Women, and Feminist Perspectives on Psychology.  Scholarly work  Beck is the author of numerous books and essays focusing on Franz Kafka and Yiddish theatre (1972), Frida Kahlo and Isaac Bashevis Singer (with whom she worked closely and whose stories she translated from Yiddish). She is the editor of Nice Jewish Girls: A Lesbian Anthology (1982/1989). She wrote on multiculturalism and the impact of sexism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia on women’s identity development. She lectured on these themes in Europe, Japan and across the United States. Interviews with her appear in English, German and Japanese journals. She was invited to discuss Freud’s legacy on The Diane Rehm Show and was heard on NPR with a critique of the epithet \\"Jewish American Princess\\" on which she wrote. As of 2015 she was editing a collection of her essays and revising her book-length manuscript Physical Illness, Psychological Woundedness and the Healing Power of Art in the Life and Work of Franz Kafka and Frida Kahlo. Another avenue of current research focuses on the impact of sacred circle dance on the lives of older women. After intensive training with teachers from Europe, South America, and the United States, she began teaching this dance practice regularly in the Washington, DC area, while running inter- arts workshops combining poetry with sacred circle dance at professional meetings. Personal life Her first marriage, in 1954, was to mathematician Anatole Beck: the couple raised two children, Nina and Micah. The marriage ended in divorce in 1974. Aged 40 she \\"came out\\". She subsequently married Lee Knefelkamp, who is an academic in psychology and education (and a woman). Evelyn Torton Beck has been a grandmother since 2001.

The station was situated on the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) Audley branch line. The Audley line ran from a junction on the Stoke to Crewe line near to a junction between and on the Stoke to Market Drayton Line Like many of the lines opened by the NSR the Audley line was built primarily to carry mineral traffic. The line opened in 1870 but passenger services were not introduced until 1880, partially a wait caused by the need to build a junction from the Audley line that would allow trains to run directly towards Stoke rather than having to reverse at the junction which was how the line was originally constructed. The decision to introduce passenger trains over the line led to the opening of a station to serve the mining village of Leycett in June 1880. By 1923 the station was served six services a day in each direction from , three terminating at and the others continuing to . The rise in local bus services led to a decline in the revenue raised from passengers and in 1931 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway withdrew all passenger services on the Audley line from 27 April 1931. Freight traffic too had been diminished by the economic depression towards the end of the 1920s and many of the local collieries closed as they became worked out or uneconomic to maintain and the line was reduced to a single line in 1933 although freight services continued until complete closure of the line between Audley and Keele in June 1962.

The film is preserved in the Library of Congress collections.The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: The Cradle Plot As described in a film magazine, Margaret Harvey's (Clayton) husband, physician Dr. Robert Harvey (Meredith), is won away from his home by an attractive patient. A divorce follows and the doctor marries the patient. Margaret marries an old admirer, and the child Doris (Irving) is assigned to the custody of both parents for alternate periods of six months each. Both the step-mother and step-father resent the child's presence in their homes, and estrangement disturbs both households. The serious illness of the child results in the realization that the bond of parentage is stronger than man-made marriage, and the film closes with two more divorces and the prospect of a remarriage.

The organization headquarters are in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with local operations around the globe. Since the organization was founded in 2001, DOT has directly impacted more than 6,000 youth worldwide, who have gone on to reach over 1 million of their fellow community members. More than 90% of alumni go on to either secure employment or start their own businesses within six months of completing DOT programming. DOT’s stated mission is \\"to create a youth-led movement of daring social innovators who have the tools, knowledge and networks to create opportunities and transform their own communities.  The DOT Model  DOT operates under a youth- leading-youth model. Each of its economic, education and leadership programs are facilitated by recent graduates from the local area. Those team members are called DOT Interns. Interns go through a month-long training process where they learn writing, collaboration, facilitation and coaching skills. They then offer DOT's signature programs at partner organizations across their country. Each DOT Intern is projected to impact 200 of their peers. DOT's programs include: *ReachUp! - an economic program that trains university and college graduates to deliver technology, business, and workforce readiness skills *StartUp! - an entrepreneurship program that addresses the business and technology skills needed to scale already existing businesses and to create sustainable, customer-centric small and medium-sized enterprises *TeachUp! - an information and communications technology program that places young university graduates in schools to guide and assist teachers with integrating technology into their classrooms. TeachUp! is offered in Lebanon and Mexico *IBM's Corporate Service Corps program - Since 2008, DOT has been working with IBM to implement its employee leadership and global citizenship program. IBM Corporate Service Corps deploys IBM employees to countries around the world to help solve local challenges and build leadership skills of the employees and the community members. As one of four international partners, DOT coordinates IBM employees assigned to 11 countries around the world, including China, Turkey, Egypt, and Kenya.  Leadership  DOT’s President and CEO is Janet Longmore, who has been recognized as a leading social entrepreneur. In 2013, Longmore was named a Social Entrepreneur of the Year by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, becoming only the second Canadian to ever win the award. She has also been named a Senior Fellow with Ashoka Canada for her leadership at DOT. Longmore is a member of the World Economic Forum. David Johnston, a former Governor General of Canada, was DOT’s first chair of the board of directors, a role he served in during his time as the President of the University of Waterloo. The current chairman of the board is Patrick Gossage, who served as press secretary to former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  Expansion  Indigenous Canada In Fall 2014, DOT launched ReachUp! North, its first program in Canada targeted at Indigenous youth. The program adapts DOT's international ReachUp! program to meet the unique needs of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit youth in Ottawa, and adds a cultural component to the workplace and digital skills training. The program is meant to help counter higher-than-average rates of unemployment among Aboriginal youth in Canada. Ethiopia The latest funding from the Government of Canada was in support of youth employment programming in urban Ethiopia. The $10 million contribution aims to build the entrepreneurship and business skills of 75,000 young people in the country by 2018. The grant will also help DOT Ethiopia establish a series of Business Development Service Centers in Addis Ababa, Hawassa, and Mekele.

First year Initially the Corps only had a sergeant, a corporal and 18 troopers. It was commanded from 1808 to 1814 by Major (later LtCol) George Scovell, seconded from the Portuguese Quartermaster-General's Department. Wellington later mentioned that when he took command of the army in April 1809 he formed a Corps of Horsemen then he denominated the Corps of Mounted Guides which was placed under the command of an officer of the British Quartermaster-General's Department. Transformation into a intelligence corps Wellington rapidly expanded and transformed the Corps into a real military intelligence corps at the service of the leaders of the Anglo-Portuguese Army in the field, and it was indeed attached to the British Quartermaster-General's Department. Some 15 officers (including 12 Portuguese) were appointed to the corps between 25 April and 3 June 1809; many more enlisted men were also added and, in 1813, the corps had 12 officers and 193 men. In 1808-1810 the corps was largely Portuguese, its officers being generally students of the University of Coimbra. All were to speak both English and Portuguese. Later recruits were generally of foreign deserters and Spaniards in order to gather information for the Anglo-Portuguese Army in Spain and southern France. In action The corps also took advantage of the semaphores. In the 1812-1814 campaigns the Corps of Mounted Guides was increasingly tasked with transmission of despatches, and also became more involved in provost duties. This corps is somewhat hard to classify as it was not listed on the official establishment of either the Portuguese Army or the official establishment of the British Army. As it was initially raised in Portugal with Portuguese personnel. It disbanded in the middle of 1814, probably because of the end of the Peninsular War and the end of the Anglo-Portuguese Army Uniform The clothing issued in 1808 was obviously in the style of the light dragoons. Its \\"complete suits\\" included helmets, a pelisse like the hussars', and boots. Stable dress included a red stable shirt, trousers, shoes with laces. The guides were described in 1813 Francis Larpent as dressed \\"in scarlet jackets looking more regular than most Spanish regulars and not unlike our own volunteer yeomanry cavalry with an air of consequence\\". This certainly indicates that the style was indeed that of the light dragoons before 1812–1813, featuring the tarleton helmet and the jacket trimmed with cords. It would also seem to indicate that the guides wore the colours of the British Quartermaster-General's Department: scarlet faced with blue, with white or silver buttons and lace.

It allows applications to be safely run from a web browser, independent of user operating system, at near-native speeds. Overview The Android Runtime for Chrome is a partially open-sourced project under development by Google. It was announced by Sundar Pichai at the Google I/O 2014 developer conference.Google I/O 2014 - Keynote - YouTube In a limited beta consumer release in September 2014,Google Chrome Blog: First set of Android apps coming to a Chromebook near you Duolingo, Evernote, Sight Words, and Vine Android applications were made available in the Chrome Web Store for installation on Chromebook devices running OS version 37 or higher. , the development by Google is taking place behind closed doors with individual repository commits, code reviews and most issue tracking being kept internal to the company. The open sourced parts of ARC are licensed under a BSD-style license. Development In a limited beta consumer release in September 2014,Google Chrome Blog: First set of Android apps coming to a Chromebook near you Duolingo, Evernote, Sight Words, and Vine Android applications were made available in the Chrome Web Store for installation on Chromebook devices running OS version 37 or higher. In October 2014, three more apps were added: CloudMagic, Onefootball, and Podcast Addict.http://www.omgchrome.com/three-android-apps-officially-available- chrome-os-including-podcast-addict In March 2015, Anandtech reported that VLC media player should be added in the coming months.http://www.anandtech.com/show/9082/the-chromebook-pixel-2015-review/5 On April 1, 2015, Google released ARC Welder, a Chrome Packaged App providing the ARC runtime and application packager. It is intended to give Android developers a preview of the upcoming technology and a chance to test their Android apps on the Chrome platform. Architecture ARC builds upon the Google Native Client.https://tc.gtisc.gatech.edu/bss/2014/l/proposals/meng.xu.pdf The Native Client platform is being extended with a POSIX-compatible layer on top of the NaCl Integrated Runtime and Pepper APIs which emulate the Linux environment in the foundation of an Android phone. This then allows running an almost unchanged Dalvik VM in a sandboxed environment. ARC uses the Chrome permission system, not the Android one. Security According to a security evaluation by Meng Xu, ARC apps may communicate with other installed Chrome Extensions and the files stored on the underlying operating system which might open avenues to various attacks. These threats are mitigated by the heavily sandboxed environment of ARC.https://tc.gtisc.gatech.edu/bss/2014/l/final/mengxu.pdf Community efforts During the second half of 2014, before any developer tools or documentation was released by Google, several community efforts about ARC appeared. Vlad Filippov maintains ARChon, an unofficial distribution of the ARC runtime which can be installed to non-chromebook computers.vladikoff / ARChon — Bitbucket The same developer also maintains a JavaScript (nodejs) tool to automate packaging Android apps for use with ARC.vladikoff/chromeos- apk · GitHub< Other developers created more user-friendly tools beyond chromeos-apk to simplify packaging applications for the ARCon runtime.

Name  The village was also known as Muhadžer-Talinovac (Мухацер-Талиновац) and Muadžer Talinovac (Муаџер Талиновац).  Geography  It is situated on the slopes of Žegovac, by the Sitnica river.  History  The settlement was founded by Albanian muhajirs in the second half of the 19th century, hence the name. The Albanians left the settlement during the Balkan Wars for Turkey, after which it was settled by Serbs. Prior to World War II, the village had approximately 60 Serb houses and 30 Albanian houses. After the war, the population structure shifted with increasing number of Albanians, so that in the 1990s, there were roughly twice the number of Albanians than Serbs. After the Kachak movement in Kosovo and Metohija between 1918–1924, the Yugoslav government disarmed the village, which was administratively part of the Nerodimlje srez.  Demographics  According to the 1981 census, there were 1133 inhabitants, out of whom 730 (64.43%) were Albanians and 394 (34.77%) were Serbs. According to the 2011 census, the village had 1961 inhabitants, out of whom 99.08% were Albanians. = Serb refugees = A married couple of Serbs, war refugees who had returned to the village, were murdered in their house on 6 July 2012. After the murders, the village Serbs asked the government to secure their relocation to either Strpce or Gracanica, or else they were to leave for Central Serbia. Before the Kosovo War, the village was ethnically mixed, with ca. 300 Serbs. In 1999, all Serbs were expelled. In 2006, 30 Serbs returned to the village. Until the murders, 18 Serbs lived in the village.

The number of Israeli casualties was 15 according to a report by Al Mayadeen television station. A Spanish UN peacekeeper was also killed by Israeli fire during consequent fire exchanges in the area, with Israel firing artillery and Hezbollah responding by mortar shells. The conflict ended later the same day after UNIFIL mediation. Background During the Syrian Civil War, Hezbollah has had an increasing presence in southern Syria. Israel was accused of launching several airstrikes against Hezbollah and Syrian Army targets in southern Syria during the civil war, though it denied involvement. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrullah had warned that it would retaliate against Israeli attacks against Hezbollah inside Syria.BBC News - 'Israel strike' kills Hezbollah men in Syria's ... On January 18, 2015, an airstrike was launched against a convoy, killing six Hezbollah militants, including two prominent members and Iranian Revolutionary Guards general Mohammad Ali Allahdadi, at al-Amal Farms (Mazraat Amal) in the Quneitra District of Syria, in the Golan Heights. Hezbollah and IRGC held Israel responsible and threatened to retaliate. Amid official Israeli silence, a flurry of statements from anonymous Israeli officials made contradictory claims, one saying that Israel believed it was attacking only low-ranking Hezbollah militants planning an attack on Israelis at the frontier fence. One Israeli official reportedly apologised anonymously. On January 27, at least two rockets from Syria hit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, and Israel responded with airstrikes and 20 artillery shells against Syrian army artillery positions. A senior IDF official held Hezbollah responsible. Attack On January 28, 2015, at 11:25am (UTC+02:00), a Hezbollah unit, \\"al- Quneitra Martyrs' group\\" (, a reference to the attack in Quneitra against a Hezbollah convoy), comprising five militants, fired anti-tank missiles (supposedly 9M133 Kornet) at two Humvees of an Israeli military convoy of 432nd \\"Tsabar\\" Infantry Battalion of the Givati Brigade in the Israeli- occupied Shebaa Farms near the Lebanon border. Hezbollah immediately issued a brief statement claiming responsibility for the attack. A Lebanese army spokesman later said the missile was not fired from Lebanese territory. Two hours after the initial attack, Israel fired at least 50 artillery shells into Shebaa Farms and the surrounding hills and South Lebanese border villages, and Israeli warplanes carried out mock air raids over the scene of the attack. Hezbollah responded with mortar shells against Israeli positions in the Shebaa farms area along the Golan Heights-Lebanon border. Commander of the UNIFIL forces Major General Luciano Portolano called for restraint from all parties in order to prevent escalation. Shelling ceased around 2 pm, although Israeli warplanes hovered overhead. Aftermath The Hezbollah attack on the Israeli convoy at Shebaa farms killed two and wounded seven Israeli soldiers, according to the Israeli military. The IDF identified the victims as Sergeant Dor Chaim Nini, 20, and Captain Yochai Kalangel, 25. Al Mayadeen satellite channel said that fifteen soldiers had been killed in the attack. A Spanish UN peacekeeper, Cpl. Francisco Javier Soria Toledo, was killed by Israeli fire; Israel acknowledged this but said that it had no intentions to harm UN troops. Flights were suspended at the Israeli airports in Rosh Pina and Haifa. In Beirut, celebratory gunfire could be heard the afternoon after the attack. According to Robert Tait in The Telegraph, Israel stood on the brink of all- out conflict with Hezbollah by performing air and ground strikes against it in retaliation for the incident, though while things were tense neither side was interested in further escalation. No Israeli reserve soldiers were mobilised, thus indicating that an \\"all-out conflict\\" was out of the question.

This ability is connected to their multiple roles in the organism: they are powerful effector cells of the innate immune system, but also important in removal of cellular debris, embryonic development and tissue repair. By simplified classification, macrophage phenotype has been divided into 2 groups: M1 (classically activated macrophages) and M2 (alternatively activated macrophages). This broad classification was based on in vitro studies, in which cultured macrophages were treated with molecules that stimulated their phenotype switching to a particular state. In addition to chemical stimulation, it has been shown that the stiffness of the underlying substrate a macrophage is grown on can direct polarization state, functional roles and migration mode. A continuum of M1-M2 polarization may arise even in the absence of polarizing cytokines and differences in substrate. stiffness M1 macrophages were described as the pro-inflammatory type, important in direct host-defense against pathogens, such as phagocytosis and secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines and microbicidal molecules. M2 macrophages were described to have quite the opposite function: regulation of the resolution phase of inflammation and the repair of damaged tissues. Later, more extensive in vitro and ex vivo studies have shown that macrophage phenotypes are much more diverse, overlapping with each other in terms of gene expression and function, revealing that these many hybrid states form a continuum of activation states which depend on the microenvironment.Rőszer, T. (2015). Understanding the Mysterious M2 Macrophage through Activation Markers and Effector Mechanisms. Mediators of Inflammation, 2015, 1–16. Moreover, in vivo, there is a high diversity in gene expression profile between different populations of tissue macrophages. Macrophage activation spectrum is thus considered to be wider, involving complex regulatory pathway to response to plethora of different signals from the environment. The diversity of macrophage phenotypes still remain to be fully characterized in vivo. The imbalance of the macrophage types is related to a number of immunity-related diseases.Wermuth, P. J., & Jimenez, S. A. (2015). The significance of macrophage polarization subtypes for animal models of tissue fibrosis and human fibrotic diseases. Clinical and Translational Medicine, 4(1), 2. For example, it has been shown that increased M1/M2 ratio correlates with development of inflammatory bowel disease Lissner, D., Schumann, M., Batra, A., Kredel, L. I., Kühl, A.

Disequilibrium of M1 and M2 macrophages correlates with the development of experimental inflammatory bowel diseases. Immunological Investigations, 43(7), 638–652., as well as obesity in mice.Cucak H, Grunnet LG, Rosendahl A. Accumulation of M1-like macrophages in type 2 diabetic islets is followed by a systemic shift in macrophage polarization. J Leukocyte Biol 2014; 95:149–60. On the other side, in vitro experiments implicated M2 macrophages as the primary mediators of tissue fibrosis. Several studies have associated the fibrotic profile of M2 macrophages with the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis.Soldano S, Contini P, Brizzolara R, Montagna P, Sulli A, Paolino S et al. A1. Increased presence of CD206+ macrophage subset in peripheral blood of systemic sclerosis patients. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd 2015:A5–6.  M1 macrophages  Classically activated macrophages (M1) were named by Mackaness in the 1960s. M1-activation in vitro is evoked by treatment with TLR ligands such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - typical for Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) - typical for Gram-positive bacteria, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or combination of LPS and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ).Krausgruber, Thomas, et al. \\"IRF5 promotes inflammatory macrophage polarization and TH1-TH17 responses.\\" Nature immunology 12.3 (2011): 231-238.Martinez, F. O., & Gordon, S. (2014). The M1 and M2 paradigm of macrophage activation: time for reassessment. F1000Prime Reports, 6(March), 1–13. Similarly in vivo, classically activated macrophages arise in response to IFN-γ produced by Th1 lymphocytes or by natural killer cells (NK), and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), produced by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). M1-activated macrophages express transcription factors such as Interferon-Regulatory Factor (IRF5), Nuclear Factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer (NF-κB), Activator-Protein (AP-1) and STAT1. This leads to enhanced microbicidal capacity and secretion of high levels of pro- inflammatory cytokines: e.g. IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNFα. Moreover, to increase their pathogen-killing ability, they produce increased amounts of chemicals called reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen radicals (caused by upregulation of inducible NO synthase iNOS). Thanks to their ability to fight pathogens, M1 macrophages are present during acute infectious diseases. A number of studies have shown that bacterial infection induces polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, resulting in phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria in vitro and in vivo. For instance, Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram positive bacteria causing listeriosis is shown to induce an M1 polarization, as well as Salmonella typhi (the agent of typhoid fever) and Salmonella typhimurium (causing gastroenteritis), which are shown to induce the M1 polarization of human and murine macrophages. Macrophages are polarized toward the M1 profile during the early phase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, as well as other mycobacterial species such as Mycobacterium ulcerans (causing Buruli ulcer disease) and Mycobacterium avium. Improper and untimely control of M1 macrophage-mediated inflammatory response can lead to disruption of normal tissue homeostasis and impede vascular repair. An uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during the inflammation can lead to the formation of cytokine storm, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of severe sepsis.Wynn, T. A., Vannella, K. M., & Diseases, I. (2017). Macrophages in tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis Thomas, 44(3), 450–462. In order to counteract the inflammatory response, macrophages undergo apoptosis or polarize to an M2 phenotype to protect the host from the excessive injury.  M2 macrophages  Alternatively activated macrophages (M2) were discovered in early 1990s and named according to previously-discovered Th2 cell-mediated anti-inflammatory response. M2 macrophages resolve inflammation, help tissue healing, tolerate self-antigens and certain neoantigens (for example apoptotic cells, symbiont cells, gametes and cells of the embryo in the uterus). M2 macrophages hence govern functions at the interfaces of immunity, tissue development and turnover, metabolism, and endocrine signaling. It is shown in vitro that macrophage treatment with IL-4 and IL-13 leads to inhibition of pro- inflammatory signals production and upregulation of scavenging mannose receptor CD206. Further studies have shown that M2 polarization may be induced through different activation signals leading in fact to different M2 phenotypes having different roles. It has first been suggested that M2 macrophages can be divided in two groups: regulatory and wound-healing macrophages. Regulatory macrophages were described to have anti-inflammatory properties, which are important in resolutive phases of the inflammation, producing the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. Differentiation toward the regulatory macrophage phenotype may be triggered by immune complexes, prostaglandins, apoptotic cells and IL-10. On the other side, wound healing macrophages were shown to produce IL-4 and upregulate arginase activity, which is the enzyme enrolled in production of polyamines and collagen, thus regenerating the damaged tissue. Further investigation of M2 subtypes led to even more complex systematization, where the authors describe M2a, M2b, and M2c subtype. M2a macrophages are activated by IL-4 and IL-13 which evokes upregulated expression of arginase-1, mannose receptor MRc1 (CD206), antigen presentation by MHC II system, and production of IL-10 and TGF-𝛽, leading to tissue regeneration and internalization of pro-inflammatory molecules to prevent the inflammatory response. The M2b macrophages produce IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-𝛼 as a response to immune complexes or LPS, leading to activation of Th2 cells and anti-inflammatory activity. M2c macrophages are activated by IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-𝛽) and glucocorticoids, and produce IL-10 and TGFβ, leading to suppression of inflammatory response. Some authors mention the M2d subtype activation as a response to IL-6 and adenosines, and these macrophages are also referred as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Although M2 activation state involves heterogeneous macrophage populations, some markers are shared between subtypes, thus the strict macrophage division into subtypes is not possible so far. Moreover, the in vivo translation of these M2 subdivisions is difficult. Tissues contain complex range of stimuli leading to mixed macrophage populations with a wide spectrum of activation states.  Continuum of macrophage polarization states  A lot remains to be learned about macrophage polarized activation states and their role in immune response. Since there is not a rigid barrier between described macrophage phenotypes and that known markers are expressed by more than one of these activation states, it is impossible so far to classify macrophage subtypes in proper and precise way. Thus their differences are rather considered as a continuum of functional states without clear boundaries. Moreover, it is observed that macrophage states are changing during the time course of the inflammation and disease.Nguyen-Chi, M., Laplace-Builhe, B., Travnickova, J., Luz-Crawford, P., Tejedor, G., Phan, Q. T., Djouad, F. (2015). Identification of polarized macrophage subsets in zebrafish. ELife, 4(JULY 2015), 1–14.This plasticity of macrophage phenotype has added to the confusion regarding the existence of individual macrophage sub-types in vivo.  Tumour associated macrophages  Tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) are typical for their protumoural functions like promotion of cancer cell motility, metastasis formation and angiogenesisLewis, Claire E., and Jeffrey W. Pollard. \\"Distinct role of macrophages in different tumor microenvironments.\\" Cancer research 66.2 (2006): 605-612. and their formation is dependent on microenvironmetal factors which are present in developing tumour.Sica, Antonio, et al. \\"Macrophage polarization in tumour progression.\\" Seminars in Cancer Biology. Vol. 18. No. 5. Academic Press, 2008. TAMs produce immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10, TGFβ and PGE2 very small amount of NO or ROI and low levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6).Sica, Antonio, et al. Autocrine production of IL-10 mediates defective IL-12 production and NF-kappa B activation in tumor-associated macrophages. J Immunol. 2000 Jan 15;164(2):762-7. Ability of TAMs to present tumour- associated antigens is decreased as well as stimulation of the anti-tumour functions of T and NK cells. Also TAMs are not able to lyse tumour cells. Targeting of TAM may be a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer, as has been demonstrated through the delivery of agents to either alter the recruitment and distribution of TAMs, deplete existing TAMs, or induce the re- education of TAMs from an M2 to an M1 phenotype.

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an API definition drafted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that supports browser-to-browser applications for voice calling, video chat, and messaging without the need of either internal or external plugins. Usage Scenario To enable browsers using different application providers to communicate with each other (e.g. a user logged into application providers X wants to call someone that is logged into application provider Y) a so-called WebRTC trapezoid can be used. In this case the two providers use a widely used VoIP signalling protocol such as SIP to federate between them. However, each of their respective browser-based clients signals to its server using proprietary application protocols built on top of HTTP and WebSocket. This component that mediates between WebRTC and SIP is referred to as a WebRTC Gateway. Beside connecting different WebRTC applications, a WebRTC gateway also enables the communication between a WebRTC phone and a VoIP or even a PSTN phone. Thereby, a WebRTC gateway extends the scope of WebRTC applications and enables much wider reach and usage scenarios. Example of a WebRTC Trapezoid Functionality The usual process with WebRTC is that a user downloads a WebRTC JavaScript application. This application is then used to communicate with another user. A WebRTC gateway would usually contain the server from where a user would download the WebRTC JavaScript application. When receiving a call from the user, the WebRTC gateway needs to decide whether the callee is reachable over WebRTC. If not, then the call will have to be translated into SIP for example. To translate a call into SIP, the gateway will have to map different layers: * Signalling: There is no standardised signalling protocol for WebRTC applications. However, SIP over WebSockets () is often used partially due to the applicability of SIP to most of the envisaged communication scenarios as well as the availability of open source software such as JsSIP. In such a case, the gateway would only need to repackage the SIP packets from the WebSocket layer into UDP, TCP or TLS. * Media transport: The WebRTC specifications indicate that for security reasons WebRTC applications must use SRTP for transporting media content. While some VoIP applications support SRTP as well, this is optional and hence not always the case. If the callee does not support SRTP then the WebRTC gateway will have to map between SRTP and RTP. * Media content: The WebRTC specifications indicate that WebRTC applications must use for audio communication either G.711 or OPUS as the Audio codec. Applications using SIP for establishing audio session are free to choose any type of codec. If the callee does not support OPUS or G.711 then the WebRTC gateway will have to transcode between the WebRTC and SIP sides of the communication. * Media address negotiation: In order to be able to traverse all kinds of NAT, the WebRTC specifications indicate that WebRTC applications must use STUN and ICE in order to detect the addresses under which two end points can exchange media packets. While these technologies are also implemented by some SIP user agents, this is not mandatory. If the callee does not support ICE or in case media transport layer needs mapping or media transcoding is required then the WebRTC gateway will have to act as an ICE end point and route the media packets between the caller and callee. WebRTC to SIP mapping Available solutions There are already a number of open source and commercial solutions available for providing the WebRTC gateway functionality. As a lot of required functionality of a WebRTC gateway such as media handling, signalling mapping is supported by SBC the function of WebRTC gateway is often integrated into SBCs or provided by SBC vendors. =Open source WebRTC Gateways= * OverSIP * Kamailio * Asterisk * reSIProcate and repro * WebRTC2SIP * Janus * FreeSWITCH * SylkServer * mediasoup =Proprietary Solutions= * AhoyRTC * AudioCodes WebRTC enabled SBC, WebRTC GW * Cisco Meeting Server (previously Acano) * Video RTC Gateway (WebRTC)https://www.ivrpowers.com/videortc/ * FRAFOS ABC WebRTC Gateway *Frozen Mountain - LiveSwitchhttps://www.frozenmountain.com/products- services/liveswitch/ * IVèS Audio Video and Text WebRTC to SIP GW * Oracle * Pexip Infinity Platform * PortSIP WebRTC Gateway * REVE WebRTC-SIP Gateway * Ribbon's Kandy Link Gateway (previously GENBAND & Sonus) * WIT Software References Web development ","title":"WebRTC Gateway"},{"id":"45239185","text":"Lenka Procházková (born March 24, 1951) is a Czech writer.

When the Pestalozzi Froebel Teachers College and the Columbia College of Expression separated in 1944, Alexandroff became the fifth president of Columbia College. Biography Nime Kulczinsky was born to Samuel and Rashell (née Corbert) Kulczinsky on July 24, 1887 in Kishinev, Russia. He was tutored by an older brother, Alexander, at home and never attended formal school. Russia was not safe for progressive-thinking Jewish men at this time (e.g. Kishinev pogrom) and he left Russia around 1902, walking from Kishinev to Brenmen, Germany, taking a boat to England, then another, the S.S. Westernlands, to America. He arrived in Philadelphia in 1904 with $5.00 and training as a locksmith. He lived with the Weiss family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania later changing his name to Norman Alexandroff. By 1908, he was a master toolmaker and mechanic and worked in factories and machine shops in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York, and Milwaukee. He became fluent in English and gave speeches, engaged in debates, and wrote articles. In 1911 he was part of lecture team with musician Von Liebnicht where he discussed drama and they became a popular feature on the national lecture circuit. In 1912 he became a naturalized citizen. In 1916, with writer William Dean Howells, he organized reading centers for foreign-born people and with Howells, David Starr Jordan, and Jack London, founded the Literary Association of America which he served as president until 1922. In 1922, he married Cherrie Phillips in New York then moved to Chicago where Cherrie taught in the Chicago public school system. In 1931, he developed a radio program, Pages from Life, recounting the adventures of the fictional Mr. Rubin and his Hurry-up Substitute Company; he played all the parts. He then produced The Rise of America radio program, later known as Cavalcade of America. Concurrently, he also organized several community programs in opera, theater, and music and penned a study, Children and Radio, which provoked national discussion about the effect of radio on children. In 1934, Herman Hofer Hegner, acting president of Petalozzi Froebel Teachers College and Columbia College of Expression, asked Alexandroff to begin a course of study at Columbia for radio broadcasting. By 1937, he had become vice president of Columbia College of Expression and was a member of both institutions Board of Directors along with Herman Hofer Hegner, his wife Erme Rowe Hegner, and Cherrie Alexandroff. In 1939 he served as director of the Howard Association, an organization dedicated to the rehabilitation and aid to released prisoners and in 1940 he started the National Artists Foundation to launch young actors into their careers. In 1944, Columbia College of Expression became a separate institution from the Pestalozzi Froebel Teachers College and was now known simply as Columbia College. The school held several credentials, including the Illinois State Examining Board for Teacher Education credential, qualifying it to enroll G.I. Bill veterans. In the same year, Norman, with psychologist Dr. Daniel D. Howard, wrote The Occupational and Educational Adjustment of Veterans, a study looking at the effects of war on returning veterans. Columbia College was designated as one of fifteen Veterans Guidance Centers in the United States which made available free comprehensive testing, educational and occupational counseling and psychological services to World War II veterans. During the 1950s, Norman began Columbia College Pan-Americano in Mexico City, Mexico and Columbia Los Angeles, in Los Angeles, California. Both of these campuses became independent of its parent, Columbia College Chicago in the late 1950s. His wife, Cherrie, died October 20, 1954 and he married Leonora in 1958. He served as president of Columbia College Chicago until his death on May 26, 1960 in California. His son, Mirron (Mike) Alexandroff succeeded him as president of the College in 1961.

He was the first Arab emissary to visit the United States. He was sent by the Sultan of Oman, Seyyid Said bin Sultan and sailed in 1840 from Zanzibar, in a newly built ship, called the Sultanah, to New York for trade between the two countries. He worked as Seyyid Said’s Private Secretary and Political Advisor. He kept a Log Book during the entire journey to the United States recording all the trade transactions and events. The Log Book was in the family of Saleh bin Abbas bin Abdulamir AlShaibaniy through his father’s great uncle, Nasser bin Saleh bin Suleiman AlShaibany. Na’aman had two daughters. Fatma and Maryam. The later was married to Nasser bin Saleh bin Suleiman AlShaibani but they had no children. Voyage to the United States Sayyid Said bin Sultan had long flirted with the idea of sending one of his vessels to the US. In 1839, several senior members of the New York firm Scoville and Britton arrived in Zanzibar and sought to persuade Sayyid Said to open direct trade with New York. Sayyid Said selected his private secretary Ahmad bin Na'aman on his royal ship, Al-Sultanah for the voyage to New York. The ship was navigated by an English captain, but was replaced by an American sailing master upon its return to Zanzibar. After loading some cargo in Muscat, al-Sultanah took on additional cargo in Zanzibar and set sail for America, stopping only in St. Helena. The ship was well received on its arrival in New York in early May 1840 and its officers were invited to visit the Navy Yard, take a train ride, and attend a reception for the governor of New York and vice-president of the United States. The US Navy undertook repairs to al-Sultanah, as a gesture of gratitude for al-Sultanah’s assistance to the American vessel Peacock, which had been damaged when it went aground on a coral reef off Masirah Island in 1835. The trip was primarily a commercial venture and al-Sultanah’s cargo of Persian carpets, coffee, dates, ivory tusks, gum copal, cloves, and salted hides was offloaded in New York. The proceeds were used to purchase American goods including general merchandise, personal items for Sayyid Said and his brother, and some chandeliers and mirrors for several Zanzibar merchants. Ahmad bin Na'aman had two daughters, Fatma and Maryam. His daughter Maryam was married to Nasser bin Saleh bin Nasser bin Suleiman Al-Sheibani but they had no children. Ahmad bin Na'aman's estate was inherited by Abdulamir bin Ali bin Saleh Al-Sheibani, the nephew of Nasser, Ahmad bin Na'aman's son in-law. Abdulamir bin Ali inherited Ahmad bin Na'aman's logbook that was used in the al-Sultanah's voyage to New York in 1840. Abdulamir's family donated the logbook to Oman's Ministry of Heritage and it is now in the Museum in Muscat. Ahmed bin Na'aman died in Zanzibar in 1869.

During World War II (1939–45) it was used by the Académie française for its Prix de Rome scholars. The villa continues to be used for cultural purposes. Location The Villa Paradiso was built around 1900 by the architect Constantin Scala for the baroness Hélène van Zuylen, née de Rothschild. It is an imposing building surrounded by a large garden. The property is in the north of the old city of Nice, almost east of the Musée Marc Chagall. The grounds cover . After World War II (1939–45) various public facilities were added including a children's playground and an outdoor amphitheater. In spring the park blooms with many flowers in different colors. Académie française The Académie de France en Rome left the Villa Medici in 1940 during the war. The next year, at the instigation of Jérôme Carcopino, the Academy took up residence in Nice at the Villa Paradiso. Its public rooms and huge stables were hastily converted into studios for the artists. These were the architect Bernard Zehrfuss, who won the Grand Prix de Rome for architecture in 1939 and led the Oppède group, and Pierre-Robert Lucas, who won the Grand prix de Rome for painting in 1937. René Leleu, who won the Grand Prix de Rome for sculpture in 1939, worked at the Villa Paradiso and then in Fontainebleau. Later use One of the studies when occupied by the sculptor Marcel Mayer just after the war The villa and grounds became the property of the city of Nice after the war. The city let the sculptor Marcel Mayer use one of the studios, where he executed various public commissions for seven years. He had been imprisoned in Germany and then in Rava-Ruska, Ukraine during the war. In the late 1940s the Nice Conservatory was installed at the Villa Paradiso. From 1957–2006 the Académie Internationale d'Eté de Nice (Nice International Summer Academy) was held at the Villa Paradiso in the premises of the conservatory.

During the Second World War he worked on the proximity fuse. He was an advocate for introduction of metric weights and measures to the United States.Allen V Astin is dead at 79, obituary in The New York Times, retrieved 2015 Jan 28  Early years  Allen Astin was the eldest of three children of a school teacher in Utah. Astin's father died when he was only four years old. He graduated from the University of Utah physics program and in 1928 was granted a PhD in physics from New York University. That same year, Astin obtained a two-year fellowship for studies at Johns Hopkins University. Upon completing the fellowship he secured a staff position at the National Bureau of Standards, eventually working his way up to his appointment as Director in May, 1952.  AD-X2 controversy  The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) began researching electric batteries in 1917 as part of the war effort. In its annual report for 1918, the bureau announced: \\"The need of the development of specifications and methods of test for electric batteries has long been recognized; but facilities have not been available to undertake this work. The needs of the military departments have recently become so urgent that the study of batteries has been undertaken.\\" In addition to testing batteries for other government agencies, the NBS also tested battery additives of various kinds purported to improve battery life and performance. Even though testing continued until 1957 no additive was ever found to have beneficial effects. As far back as 1931, in order to respond to an increasing number of requests for battery additive testing, the Bureau issued Letter Circular (LC) 302, Battery Compounds and Solutions. The letter stated: \\"The later tests confirm the Bureau's previous conclusions that these materials do not charge storage batteries nor do they materially improve the performance of the batteries.\\" The controversy began when an entrepreneur, Jess M. Ritchie, CEO of Pioneers, a company based in Oakland, CA, began marketing a battery additive AD-X2 under the brand \\"Protecto-Charge\\" shortly after the end of World War II. By 1948 sales of Protecto-Charge had started to pick up, but when Ritchie was made aware of LC 302, he became concerned enough that he leveraged his connections with the Oakland Better Business Bureau to put pressure on the NBS to test his product. Despite its stated position that battery additives were worthless and partly in response to the mounting political pressure, the NBS eventually went ahead and quietly tested AD-X2 in early 1949, with the expected result that it had no beneficial effect. This wasn't the result that Ritchie wanted, and he continued escalating his political campaign. In 1953, a year after Astin was appointed Director of the NBS, the US Post Office, in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission, issued a postal fraud order banning the use of mailings to promote Ritchie's product. Sinclair Weeks, the recently appointed Secretary of Commerce, called Astin in and demanded his resignation, which he gave immediately. The politically driven circumstances of Astin's dismissal was picked up by the press and political cartoonists. An article by Drew Pearson, a Washington Post syndicated columnist, led to a national uproar, especially in the scientific community. The Federation of American Scientists and the American Physical Society protested the politicization of the NBS with its reputation for unbiased, objective, science-based research. Over 400 staff members of the NBS threatened to resign. Chastened after weeks of controversy and Congressional testimony by Astin and others, Secretary Weeks reversed his decision and reinstated Astin on August 22, 1953, some five months after demanding he resign.  Personal life  Allen Astin is the father of actor John Astin and educator Dr. Alexander Astin, and the grandfather of actors Mackenzie Astin and Sean Astin. The Allen V. Astin Measurement Science Award, first issued in 1984, is presented by the United States Department of Commerce for achievement in metrology.

The market is one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in South Korea, with more than 5000 shops and 20,000 employees in an area of . Approximately 65,000 people visit the market each day.  History  Exterior view of Gwangjang Market The Gabo Reforms, which were introduced during the Joseon dynasty, eliminated the merchant monopolies that existed in Joseon at the time by allowing anyone to engage in commercial activities. The licensed merchants and shop owners in Seoul lost much of their business to competition as a result of these reforms, so King Gojong created a warehouse market called Changnaejang, which eventually developed into Namdaemun Market. After the signing of the Eulsa Treaty in 1905, when Korea was under Japanese rule, the Japanese took control of Namdaemun Market. In reaction to the seizure of Namdaemun Market, a group of private Korean investors, including wealthy merchants, decided to create a new market that was not under the control of the Japanese. They combined funds to create the Gwangjang Corporation on 5 July 1905, and purchased the land for the market with 100,000 Won. They used the pre-existing Bae O Gae Market (), a morning market in the area, as the foundation for their new market, which they named Dongdaemun Market (). At the time, most markets were temporary and open only occasionally, so Dongdaemun Market became the first permanent market to be open every day of the week. The market was renamed Gwangjang Market in 1960.  Name  Gwangjang Market was originally the name of a single, shopping center in the center of Dongdaemun Market, which was built between 1957 and 1959. The name comes from the two bridges it was built between: Gwangkyo (; meaning \\"wide bridge\\") and Jangkyo (; meaning \\"long bridge\\").  Products  Market vendors frying bindaetteok In the early years the market only sold agricultural and seafood products, but as it became one of the largest markets in Korea, it began to sell many other products. Today the market has approximately 1500–2000 vendors selling fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, bread, clothing, textiles, handicrafts, kitchenware, souvenirs, and Korean traditional medicinal items. There are also many restaurants and food stalls selling traditional Korean cuisine, but the market is most famous for its bindaetteok, or mung bean pancakes, and mayak gimbap.  Location  The market is accessible from Jongno 5-ga or Euljiro 4-ga metro station.  In popular culture  *A 2014 episode of Running Man was partially filmed in the market. The cast stopped at various food stalls and had to choose the correct card after finishing their food to continue the race. *The premiere of The Amazing Race Australia 4 featured a 'Detour' task at the market in which teams that chose this task had to roll, fill, and fold 50 dumplings.

He previously worked for the BBC, VOA and Al Jazeera English. He was the former Minister of Planning and International Cooperation of Somalia, having been appointed to the position on 27 January 2015 by the then Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke. He held that position until April 2017. Between April–October 2017, Mr. Aynte was a Senior Advisor to the President of Somalia, H.E. Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo Among other tasks, he was responsible for planning and delivering the International London Conference on Somalia in May 2017. Mr. Aynte also helped President Farmaajo on policies and procedures governing Official Development Assistance (ODA). In November 2017, Mr. Aynte joined the United Nations as Director of Policy Planning and Strategy based in the Middle East. During his tenure as Minister, Mr. Aynte was credited with overseeing the drafting of Somalia's first National Development Plan (NDP), a three-year comprehensive economic recovery blueprint. The NDP came after exhaustive consultations with Federal Member States, civil society and the private sector. It was approved by the Federal Member States, and was subsequently endorsed at the historic London Conference on Somalia in May 2017. Mr. Aynte was widely praised for successfully ending the New Deal Compact for Somalia, and replacing it with the NDP—a Somali-led, Somali- drafted document. Mr. Aynte has also been credited with the release of the first Population Estimate Survey (PES) in Somalia in 30 years. Although the PES sparked national controversy because it released figures for Somalia's 18 administrative regions, it was widely welcomed as the first reliable data on population. Mr. Aynte was considered one of the most accomplished ministers during the Sharmarke Premiership. In his capacity as the Minister of International Cooperation, Mr. Aynte forged a very close relationship with traditional (western) and non-traditional donors, bringing them together on a common platform. He also nudged them to align their support behind Somalia's new National Development Plan and gradually phase out the New Deal Compact for Somalia. Since February 2017 Mr Aynte has been a Senior Advisor to the new President of Somalia, Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo. Mr. Aynte was handling international and development portfolios. He was the chief organizer of the Presidential Inauguration Ceremony on 22 February. Later he was the head of delivery team of the London Conference on Somalia in May 2017. The London Conference on Somalia brought together over 43 countries and international organizations, and was considered a major success. Before joining the Somali government, Mr. Aynte was the founder and Executive Director of the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies (HIPS), the first think tank in Somalia. During that period, Mr. Aynte regularly appeared on local and international media. He also frequently spoke at international platforms and even testified before the U.S. Senate on Somalia. Before founding HIPS, Mr. Aynte was a journalist and editor for over 10 years. For nearly four years, he was a Senior News Editor at Al Jazeera English, and also reported for the BBC and the VOA. Mr. Aynte holds M.A. in Government and International Studies from the Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC, and a B.A. in Journalism and Political Science from the Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mr. Aynte is the son of Dr. Yusuf Ali Aynte, a scholar of Islamic Studies and author. The Senior Aynte was also a former Member of Somalia's Parliament and continues to be a prominent civil society leader in Mogadishu.

Recently his research expanded into directions such as protocol standardisation, including the improvement of the ISO/IEC 9798 standard, and applied cryptography, leading to the development of new security requirements and protocols. His joint work with Marko Horvat, Sam Scott, and Thyla van der Merwe led to a not insignificant change to the TLS 1.3 specification. In 2018 Cremers moved from Oxford University to the Cispa Helmholtz Center for Information Security at Saarbrücken. Cremers previously worked in MSX computer game development, initially working for the Sigma Group before founding his own group Parallax; he is credited for work on nine different games, and many other demos, in a combination of roles including programmer, designer, composer, and writer.

Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah are suspected of carrying out attacks against Israeli positions on its borders with Syria and Lebanon, and Israel carries out air strikes against convoys transporting weapons to these organisations.  Background  The neighbouring states of Israel and Syria both came into being in the late 1940s but never established diplomatic relations, and have technically been in a state of war since 1948.Israel Carries Out Airstrike on Syrian Anti-Aircraft Battery NYT, 16 October 2017.Why does Israel keep attacking Syria? AJ, 23 October 2017. They have fought each other in three major wars: the 1948 Arab Israeli War, the 1967 Six-Day War, and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Both countries were later also involved in the Lebanese Civil War, including the 1982 Lebanon War. Prior to the Six-Day War, there were intense hostilities centered on demilitarized zones, water issues, and both shelling and infiltration from the Golan Heights, which have been occupied by Israel since. Israel is required to leave the Golan Heights by UN Security Council Resolution 242; but since the Yom Kippur War, the de facto border between the countries in 1974 reverting to the 1967 Purple Line, which has largely been respected by both Syria and Israel, though not by Hezbollah. A series of incidents had taken place on the Purple Line in the initial phase of the Syrian Civil War, straining Israel–Syria relations, including the Quneitra Governorate clashes, incidents between the Syrian Army and Syrian rebels on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan and the Golan Neutral Zone, and Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian Civil War. Through the incidents, which began in late 2012, as of mid-2014, one Israeli civilian was allegedly killed and at least four soldiers wounded; on the Syrian-controlled side, it was estimated that at least two unidentified militants, who had attempted to cross into the Israeli-controlled side of the Golan Heights, had been killed. Israeli standpoint = Non-interference position = Israel's official position is neutrality in the Syrian conflict,Dov Lieber - Is treating Syrians a humanitarian gesture or strategic policy for Israel? \\"Israel continues to profess its neutrality in the Syrian civil war, and security officials credibly claim that there can be no particularly good outcome as far as Israel is concerned. Whatever Syria’s ultimate fate, more than four decades of relative tranquility are plainly over. Still, both the Israeli army and experts familiar with the situation acknowledge that the IDF has contacts with rebels across the border. Which rebels, however, is a closely guarded secret. Some reports from UN peacekeepers on the border between Israel and Syria have substantiated that the IDF is providing more than just medical assistance to rebel factions. No report, however, has named Israel’s partner rebel groups or specified what the extra aid might be.\\" as per various Israeli Defense Ministers. In early July 2017, Israel's defence minister Avigdor Liberman said that while \\"the rebels are not our friends, they are all versions of al-Qaida\\", Israel could not allow a man like Bashar al-Assad to remain in power: \\"Keeping Assad in power is not in our security interests. As long as he is in power, Iran and Hezbollah will be in Syria.\\" He said that Israel had no interest in entering the Syrian civil war, but there were ″red lines″ Israel had set, such as the smuggling of sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah and Iran's presence on its borders.ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TO SYRIA: 'DON'T TEST US' The Jerusalem Post, 2 July 2017. Later in July 2017, the Israeli government said it opposed the cease-fire agreement in southern Syria that the United States, Russia, and Jordan had reached a week prior that envisaged establishing de-escalation zones along Syria's borders with both Jordan and Israel, as that would legalise Iran's presence in Syria.Netanyahu: Israel Opposes Cease-fire Deal Reached by U.S. and Russia in Southern Syria Haaretz, 17 July 2017.Russia Responds to Netanyahu's Criticism of Syrian Cease-fire: We'll Address Israel's Security Concerns JP, 17 July 2017.LIBERMAN: ISRAEL WILL RETAIN FREEDOM OF ACTION IN SYRIA The Jerusalem Post, 9 July 2017. In October 2017, Lieberman conceded that Assad was winning the war and was now being courted by foreign powers, which he said was ″unprecedented″. The statement was said to have \\"marked a reversal for Israel, where top officials had from the outset of fighting in 2011 until mid-2015 regularly predicted Assad would lose control of his country and be toppled\\". He called for the U.S. to be more active ″in the Syrian arena and in the Middle East in general″ and noted that Israel was struggling to deal with the \\"Russians, Iranians, and also the Turks and Hezbollah.\\" = Israel's opposition to Iranian presence in Syria = On 9 July 2017, a new ceasefire agreement directly brokered by the United States and Russia for southwest Syria was announced. United States and Russia have made multiple attempts in the past to reach an agreement for establishing a ceasefire in different parts of Syria. However, the earlier ceasefire attempts failed to reduce violence for long. United States President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin reached the agreement during their meeting at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, on 7 July 2017. It affects towns, villages and borderlands in three regions close to Jordan and Israel. The deal includes establishing de-escalation zones, otherwise known as safe zones, along Syria's borders with both Jordan and Israel. The Israeli government opposed the ceasefire agreement, as it claimed that its security interests were not reflected in the draft ceasefire agreement being formulated. \\"It doesn't take almost any of Israel's security interests and it creates a disturbing reality in southern Syria. The agreement doesn’t include a single explicit word about Iran, Hezbollah or the Shi’ite militias in Syria.” Israel reportedly held secret talks with Russia and the United States over the ceasefire agreement. The Israeli government stressed its desire to remove Iranian forces from Syria. However, it was disappointed, as it argued that the agreement \\"contradicted virtually all the positions Israel had presented to the Americans and Russians.\\" The Israeli government's main concern with regard to the ceasefire agreement was that it believed that Iranian influence in the region would increase. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Russian President Vladimir Putin in August 2017 to share Israel's concerns on the ceasefire agreement. \\"Mr. President, with joint efforts we are defeating Islamic State, and this is a very important thing. But the bad thing is, that where the defeated Islamic State group vanishes, Iran is stepping in,\\" he told the Russian Prime Minister. The Russian government told its Israeli counterpart that it will deter Iran or Hezbollah from opening a new front with Israel. \\"We take the Israeli interests in Syria into account,\\" Alexander Petrovich Shein, Russia's ambassador to Israel, told its Channel One television on Tuesday. \\"Were it up to Russia, the foreign forces would not stay\\", he added. A delegation, led by Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, visited Washington for talks with senior White House and Pentagon officials. One of the main issues for the discussion was the ceasefire agreement in southern Syria and its ramifications. \\"A senior Israeli official said the delegation was expected to try to persuade senior administration officials that parts of the cease-fire agreement in southern Syria should be amended to include clearer statements about the need to remove Iranian forces, Hezbollah and Shi'ite militias out of Syria\\". However, the high-level delegation was unable to \\"secure a commitment from the Americans to ensure any agreement to end the war in Syria would include the evacuation of Iranian military forces from the country\\". Following the exchange of fire on 10 May 2018, Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman said that Israel won't allow Iran to turn Syria into a \\"forward base\\" against Israel.Israel Launches Most Extensive Strike in Syria in Decades After Iranian Rocket Barrage, Haaretz, 10 May 2018 Ceasefire line incidents during the Syrian Civil War Several incidents have taken place on the Israeli–Syrian ceasefire line during the Syrian Civil War, straining the relations between the countries. The incidents are considered a spillover of the Quneitra Governorate clashes since 2012 and later incidents between Syrian Army and the rebels, in the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan and the Golan Neutral Zone and the Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian Civil War. Through the incidents, which began in late 2012, as of mid-2014, one Israeli civilian was killed and at least 4 soldiers wounded; on the Syrian-controlled side, it is estimated that at least ten soldiers were killed, as well as two unidentified militants, who were identified near Ein Zivan on Golan Heights. Iran–Israel conflict during the Syrian Civil War On several occasions, Israel reportedly carried out or supported attacks on Hezbollah and Iranian targets within Syrian territories or Lebanon. One of the first reliably reported incident of this kind took place on 30 January 2013, when Israeli aircraft struck a Syrian convoy allegedly transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. Habitually, Israel refused to comment on the incident, a stance that is believed to seek to ensure that the Syrian government did not feel obliged to retaliate. More incidents were attributed to IAF on May 2013, December 2014, April 2015. Some of those reports were confirmed by the Syrian Arab Republic, whereas others denied. Israel systematically refused to comment on alleged targeting of Hezbollah and Ba'athist Syrian targets in Syrian territory. In 2015, suspected Hezbollah militants launched a retaliatory attack on Israeli forces in Shebaa farms. In March 2017, Syria launched anti- aircraft missiles towards Israeli-controlled part of the Golan Heights, allegedly targeting Israeli IAF aircraft, which Syria claimed were on their way to attack targets in Palmyra (Syria). After the incident, the State of Israel has stated it was targeting weapons shipments headed toward anti- Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, located in Lebanon. Israel denied Syria's claim that one jet fighter was shot down and another damaged. Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria, or anywhere else in the Middle East following the incident. According to some sources, the incident was the first time Israeli officials clearly confirmed an Israeli strike on a Hezbollah convoy during the Syrian Civil War. As of September 2017, this was the only time such confirmation was issued. By early December 2017, the Israeli air force had confirmed it had attacked arms convoys of Ba'athist Syria and Lebanon's Hezbollah nearly 100 times during within over six years of the conflict in Syria.Israeli missiles hit military post near Damascus: Syrian state TV Reuters, 2 December 2017.  Israeli humanitarian aid to Syrians  In June 2016, from the territory of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967 and annexed in 1981, the Israeli military began Operation Good Neighbor, a multi-faceted humanitarian relief operation to prevent starvation of Syrians who live along the border and provide basic or advanced medical treatment.Operation Good Neighbor: Israel reveals its massive humanitarian aid to Syria The Times of Israel, 19 July 2017. The aid consisted of medical care, water, electricity, education or food and was given to Syrians near the ceasefire line between Israel and Syria, often escorted across by Israeli soldiers. Over 200,000 Syrians received such aid, and more than 4,000 of them were treated in Israeli hospitals from 2013 to September 2018.Israel treating thousands of Syrians injured in war The Independent, 8 April 2017. Many of the treated victims were civilians, often children. Allegations have been made that some were rebel fighters from the Free Syrian Army. This theory is supported by the claim that Israel had a strategic interest in aiding the rebels; they fought against both ISIL and Iranian- allied forces.Israel ‘giving secret aid to Syrian rebels’, report says: Direct funding, food, fuel and medical supplies allegedly provided by Israeli state to keep Isis and Iranian-allied forces in neighbouring civil war at bay The Independent, 19 June 2017.

Set in the 1960s, the show centres on Marie-Louise, a postmistress in the small Northern Ontario town of Lovely, on the rural outskirts of the larger city of Complexity. She possesses the supernatural ability to read through sealed envelopes, thus serving as a keeper of the town's stories and secrets, and the songs detail her revelations about life in the community. The city of Complexity is based on the Ontario city of Sudbury, while the town of Lovely is a pastiche of the city's suburban and outlying rural francophone communities such as Chelmsford, Azilda and Highway's own hometown of Noëlville.

It originally aired on January 28, 2015 in the United States on FX. Plot Elizabeth Jennings meets an ex-CIA analyst, who is willing to share a list of CIA operatives in Afghanistan, but after feeling guilty, confesses her indiscretion via telephone and tries to waylay Elizabeth until the authorities arrive. Elizabeth is chased by Frank Gaad and his associate. After fighting with them, she manages to escape with minor injuries, but loses the operatives list in the process. Gaad also informs Stan that Nina has been charged with espionage and treason. Philip and Elizabeth meet Gabriel (Frank Langella), their mentor and original contact with The Centre, who tries to persuade them to recruit Paige. Elizabeth describes how she and Paige are attending Paige's church together and that they have grown closer. She says Paige is open to new ideas and ideologies, and that she and Philip are slowly laying the groundwork for telling Paige their true identities. Later, Philip and Elizabeth argue over whether Paige should be recruited and whether or not Elizabeth is assessing her abilities for The Centre. Gabriel also gives Elizabeth a cassette tape with a recording made by her mother, in which her mother says she is dying. Stan Beeman attends EST along with Philip, but is annoyed with it and finds it stupid. He tries to give Sandra the impression he's open to EST, but when Sandra tells him to tell the truth, he confesses that he didn't like it. Arkady Ivanovich and Oleg Igorevich discuss if they can help Nina; Oleg has begged his well-connected father to intervene to no avail. Oleg is later shown tailing Stan. Philip continues to persuade Annelise to extract information from Yousaf, and she agrees, but expresses doubts and tells Philip she's in love with Yousaf. Later, while she and Yousaf are having sex, she confesses that she has a secret but swears she is on Yousaf's side. Overcome with rage, Yousaf strangles her. Philip, listening in the next room and disguised as Annelise's husband, catches him in the act but is unable to save Annelise.

It was built in 1888 and extended in 1915, both to designs of George Henry Male Addison. It is also known as Chippendale. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003.  History  The first structure built at 17 Gregory Terrace was \\"Chippendale\\", a detached house designed by George Henry Male Addison for Selina Forth. A purpose-built boarding house was added in 1915 for Pauline Eschenhagan, also to the design of George Addison. Both the house and rear addition have continued to be used as boarding house accommodation since this time, and are currently known as \\"Cliveden Mansions\\". Land in the settlement of Brisbane was first alienated from the Crown in 1856. Some of the earliest land purchases were made in the Spring Hill area, including lots along Wickham and Gregory Terraces. The site of Cliveden Mansions, described as portion 216, county of Stanley, parish of Brisbane, was originally granted to Patrick Bradley in 1861. The holding was later subdivided, and subdivisions 3 and 4 were acquired by the Crowther family in 1872. The Crowthers sold the property ten years later to Moses Ward, a Fortitude Valley chemist. Throughout this time, Post Office Directories indicate the property was vacant. Selina Forth became the owner of the property in 1888, and retained the title until her death in 1911. It was during Ms Forth's ownership of the property that Chippendale was built. The construction of Chippendale was the result of human tragedy in the Forth family. Selina Forth was the wife of John William Forth, an alderman for the east ward in 1882 and 1883, and the owner of a large wholesale and retail produce business located in Elizabeth Street. The Forths, together with their ten children, were residents of Wickham Terrace in the early 1880s, before moving to Stanley Hall at Clayfield, built for the Forths in 1885-86. The Forths resided only a short time at Stanley Hall. Clara Forth, their 20-year-old daughter, died there in 1886, and shortly after the family returned from a visit to Europe toward the end of the year, John Forth was killed while helping transplant trees in a paddock near his home, on 28 December 1886. Selina Forth subsequently sold Stanley Hall in 1888, and purchased the Gregory Terrace property in the same year. She had George Addison of Oakden, Addison and Kemp design her house in 1888-89, and in 1890 she took up residence there, naming the house Chippendale. Mrs Forth lived in the house with her son William Forth, and, on occasion, two other women. Following the death of Selina Forth in 1911, the beneficiaries of her will sold Chippendale to Pauline Emma Eschenhagen in 1913. Pauline Eschenhagen, together with her husband Carl, and later her son Edward, ran a very successful restaurant and catering business in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Anti-German sentiment during World War I forced the sale of the business in 1915, and Ms Eschenhagen mortgaged Chippendale and had the architect of the original house, GMH Addison, design the large boarding house extension to the rear of the property. It is thought the front northern addition to the house was also completed at this time. In 1915 the property was leased to Grace Tate who ran the property as a boarding house. Ms Tate held a lease on Chippendale, including the boarding house extension, at least until 1929. In the same year, the boarding house extensions were added. Ms Eschenhagen also had architect Thomas Ramsay Hall design a new villa residence further along Gregory Terrace next to St Joseph's College, and lived in this house with her family until her death in 1921. As proprietor of the boarding house establishment, Grace Tate represented a common practice whereby many of Brisbane's boarding houses were run by women. The 1916 listing of boarding houses in Pugh's Almanac noted 54 such establishments, of which 40 were run by women. The figures for 1918 show a similar pattern: 46 of the 66 boarding houses listed in Brisbane were operated by women. What was unusual about the Gregory Terrace boarding house was the purpose-built nature of the rear portion. It was a more common practice for boarding houses to be larger houses subdivided into smaller dwellings. The construction and operation of the Gregory Terrace boarding house from 1915 reflects the popularity of Spring Hill and other inner-Brisbane suburbs as locations of boarding house accommodation at that time. Boarding houses existed in Brisbane from the earliest years of free settlement in the 1840s. From this era until the 1890s, boarding houses were particularly well established in the South Brisbane/West End/Woolloongabba, and Teneriffe/Newstead areas. The Brisbane floods of 1890 and 1893 adversely affected the popularity of South Brisbane however, and the population drifted to the north side of the river. Further impetus towards the establishment of boarding house accommodation in the inner-city suburbs occurred in the 1910s when the cost of living outgrow the rise in wages, a situation worsened by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. This economic pattern may have forced many into boarding house accommodation. The Great Depression of the 1930s certainly had this effect with an influx of labour into the cities in search of work. Pugh's Almanac and the Post Office Directories from the 1910s indicate the saturation of lodging houses in Wickham Terrace and Boundary Street alone. Pugh's Almanac for the years 1916 and 1918 list 18 and 15 boarding houses in Wickham Terrace respectively, while in South Brisbane only seven are recorded for both years. The Post Office Directories for 1915-16 included listings for 195 boarding houses in Brisbane, of which six were listed in Boundary Street. While neither listing is conclusive, they do illustrate the importance of Spring Hill as a location of boarding houses. During the 1930s Spring Hill and other inner-city suburbs waned in their popularity as a \\"desirable address\\", and they remained unpopular for much of the remainder of the twentieth century. Wealthy residents increasingly relocated from their inner city dwellings to the suburbs, and the inner-city area was increasingly known as an industrial and working class area. These areas continued to be considered \\"undesirable\\" in the 1970s and early 1980s when there was a decline in the number of families with young children, and an increase in elderly and single people, migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds and Indigenous Australians residing in the area. Significant numbers of former residents of psychiatric institutions also began relocating to boarding house and hostel accommodation within inner Brisbane. Attitudes began to change in the mid to late 1980s and 1990s however, as inner-city gentrification occurred. Properties were increasingly acquired for middle-class residential, commercial, recreational and cultural uses, including many boarding houses. Between 1987 and 1996, 37 per cent of all boarding house premises in inner north Brisbane suburbs closed, and pressure of redevelopment of these places continues. The Gregory Terrace boarding house remained in the Eschenhagen family until 1949, and was renamed \\"Cliveden Mansions\\" during the family's ownership, in 1941. The Canadian Pacific Tobacco Company Ltd purchased the property in 1949, and the property was owned by four different owners during the 1950s before being bought by Salem Tamer in 1958. Hunsoomie Tamer became a joint owner in 1967, and Salem and Hunsoomie retained the property until 1979 when it was purchased by Neil Gibbins and Elaine Katte. The current owners, Treklodge Pty Ltd, purchased the property in 1992, and continue to operate Cliveden Mansions as a boarding house. Brisbane City Council building records indicate approval for alterations to the building was given in 1957. It is not certain what this work was; however, it may have included various verandah enclosures and internal planning changes that currently exist.  Description  Cliveden Mansions, circa 1930 Modern-day picture of Cliveden Mansions Cliveden Mansions consists of two main portions, the 1888-89 house fronting Gregory Terrace, and the 1915 boarding house extension to the rear. The 1888-89 section of Cliveden Mansions is a two-storey rendered brick building, featuring timber-framed floors and roof, and corrugated iron roof cladding. Two original chimneys are visible above the roof line. A series of timber-framed additions exist to the northern and eastern sides of the masonry core. The northern addition has chamferboard external cladding which has been rendered. Timber-framed verandahs to two sides have also been enclosed. Internally, the 1888-89 section consists of a series of major and minor rooms opening on to a central stairway and passage. A full room bay arrangement punctuates the otherwise rectilinear plan form and is surmounted by a distinctive octastyle roof. Most rooms have access to either the western or southern verandah. Much of the timber door and window joinery survives intact, including a coloured leaded glass main entry and coloured patterned glass stairwell window. The original timber internal staircase has been painted. Some original internal decorative finishes survive including moulded plaster cornices and ornate plaster ceiling roses. The 1915 boarding house addition is a 2-3 storey timber-framed structure with a corrugated iron hip roof. The plan form is a simple series of single rooms accessed by a central corridor and opening out on to a narrow perimeter verandah. The eastern and southern external walls are clad with chamferboards while the northern external wall is of single-skin VJ construction. The verandahs are simply detailed with timber dowel balustrades and timber French doors with fanlights opening out from the rooms. The verandah posts are stop chamfered. A modern steel stair is visible at the eastern end of the verandah. Internally, the rooms are divided by single-skin VJ walls, interior ceilings and corridor walls are lined with VJ timber. Bathrooms are fitted with post-World War II fittings of varying styles and standards. The existing brick and cast iron fence to Gregory Terrace is thought to be the original 1888-89 fence. Evidence of the front stairs and path with a distinctive 45 degree turn also survives.  Heritage listing  Cliveden Mansions was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cliveden Mansions is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history as an illustration of late nineteenth and twentieth century housing patterns in inner Brisbane. The 1888-89 section demonstrates a characteristic of Brisbane residential development whereby the wealthy built along hilltops and ridgelines, surrounded on the lower slopes and hollows by the less wealthy members of the community. It also demonstrates the expansion of residential development beyond the city centre in the later nineteenth century. The 1915 boarding house extension illustrates another housing pattern whereby inner- city suburbs such as Spring Hill had the highest concentrations of Brisbane boarding houses in the early twentieth century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The 1915 boarding house addition demonstrates rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage as a purpose-built boarding house. Most boarding houses were larger houses subdivided into smaller dwellings. The 1915 extension is also rare as a three-storey building constructed in light-weight timber framing. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The original 1888-89 house is important because of its aesthetic significance as a competent example of late nineteenth century Victorian domestic style architecture.

The Council was established in 1773 by the Regulating Act of 1773. It was designed to consist of five members, including the Governor General, and was appointed by the Court of directors. At times it also included the Commander-in-Chief of India, who was also at times the Governor General. The council was also known as Governor-General-in-Council and was subordinate only to the East India Company's Court of Directors and to the British Crown. History The Regulating Act of 1773 created the post of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal Presidency and the presidencies of Bombay and Madras were made subordinate to the Bengal Presidency. Prior to this all the three presidencies were independent of each other and was headed by Governor General and his Council or Governor-in-council. The act designated Governor of Bengal as the Governor of the Presidency of Fort William to serve as Governor General of all British Territories in India. It also added provision that Governor General was to be assisted by an executive council of four members and was given a casting vote but no veto. This changed the structure of Governor in-council where Governor General was the sole authority to a council of 5 members. The members could only be removed by the British Monarch on representation from Court of Directors. In 1774, Warren Hastings became the first Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William, hence, the first head of the Supreme Council of Bengal. Other members of the council included Lt. General John Clavering, George Monson, Richard Barwell and Philip Francis. Philip Francis along with Monson and Clavering reached Calcutta in October 1774, and a conflict with Warren Hastings started almost immediately. These three members of the council opposed Hasting's policies as Governor General and accused him of corruption. The situation climaxed with the Maharaja Nanda Kumar affair - in which Nanda Kumar accused Hastings of fraud and high corruption. This attempt to impeach Hastings was unsuccessful and Nanda Kumar was hanged in 1775 after being found guilty of forgery by Supreme Court of Bengal in Calcutta. The trial was held under childhood friend of Hastings Sir Elijah Impey - India's first Chief Justice. The majority - Francis, Clavering and Monson - within the council ended with Monson's death in 1776. Clavering died a year later and Francis was left powerless, but he remained in India and strove to undermine Hastings' governance. The bitter rivalry between the two men culminated in a duel in 1780, where Hastings shot Francis in the back. Francis left India in the hope of impeaching Hastings in 1780. Hastings resigned in 1785 and was later accused of committing a judicial murder of Nanda Kumar. Impeachment proceedings against him along with Elijah Impey were initiated by the parliament. A lengthy attempted impeachment by Parliament lasted from 1788 to 1795 eventually ending with Hastings being acquitted. Conflict with Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William From 1774 (when the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William was founded) till 1782 (when Bengal Judicature Act of 1781 was passed), the Court claimed jurisdiction over any person residing in Bengal, Bihar or Orissa. This resulted in conflict of jurisdiction with Supreme Council of Bengal. The conflict came to an end with Parliament's passing of the Bengal Judicature Act of 1781. The act restricted the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to either those who lived in Calcutta, or to any British Subject in Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. This removed the Court's jurisdiction over any person residing in Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. Role The Regulating Act of 1773 made presidencies of Bombay and Madras subordinate to Bengal. Governor-in-Council of Bombay and Madras presidencies were required to obey the orders of Governor General of Bengal. Governor-General-in-Council was given the power to make rules, ordinances and regulations. These rules and regulations were required to be registered with the Supreme court and could only be dissolved by the King-in- Council within 2 years.

Though edge lettering had existed for over a century, the earliest methods were costly and time-consuming. In 1649, Peter Blondeau introduced a new method at the Royal Mint in England, which he kept secret. Later, in 1685, Castaing proposed that his machine be used in the mints of France. His proposal was approved, and Castaing later became general manager of all the mints in the nation. Castaing introduced other ideas, including the reforming and recoining of already existing French coins with edge lettering to reduce instances of counterfeiting and raise money for King Louis XIV's efforts in the Nine Years' War. During the carrying out of one such operation, Castaing was accused of malversation. His wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch) petitioned the court on his behalf, and he was freed two years later. He died at some point in the early eighteenth century.  Castaing machine  A nineteenth century illustration of Castaing's machine Before milled coinage gained precedence in Europe, the irregular and crude hammered coinage was relatively easy to counterfeit and subject to clipping, an act which involved removing valuable metal from the edge of a coin before placing it back into circulation. In the sixteenth century, the French engineer Aubin Olivier introduced to France the coin press, to which he added a split collar capable of creating edge lettering. In order to remove the newly struck coin, the collar had to be disassembled, which was a time-consuming process. In addition, the upper coinage die was prone to strike the collar on its descent, causing expensive damage. Peter Blondeau addressed those concerns when, in 1649, he was summoned to the Royal Mint in England to modernise minting operations there. Blondeau introduced a method for edge lettering which he claimed was considerably faster and less costly than the earlier, well-known technology, but he maintained secrecy in regards to the device. In , Jean Castaing invented a machine capable of applying edge lettering to 20,000 coins daily. He approached the French government in 1685 in the hope of getting it adopted into use at the French mints. King Louis XIV was a proponent of the machine, but its introduction was opposed by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis' financial minister, who believed edge lettering unnecessary and the machines too costly to install. In 1686, however, Castaing's proposal was approved by the Council of State, and he entered into a contract to install his machine at the various French mints.  Recoining and arrest  A 1701 gold Louis d'or, overstruck using Castaing's method. An older 1690s date is visible on the reverse In 1688, Castaing proposed a method of reshaping and restriking existing coins, both as a response to counterfeiting and to help the Louis XIV raise money to support the Nine Years' War. The French government approved Castaing's method, because it was considerably less costly than the alternative method of melting the coins before restriking them. A Paris tinsmith, Martin Masselin, was chosen to undertake the job of annealing, blanching, and edge-marking the recoined pieces; he was paid fourteen deniers for each coin, with an additional 17 deniers for each restruck within the first three months of his contract. In 17 months of his contract, a deficit of 150,000 livres was discovered at the Paris Mint, and Masselin was charged with stealing the pieces. He and his clerks in Paris and at the provincial mints were dismissed, and in 1691, Castaing was given general management of all twenty-six French mints and the task of restriking the old coinage. Castaing was paid eight deniers for each coin restruck, and when the King ordered a second reformation of the currency in 1693, Castaing's wage was reduced to three deniers per coin. On 21 March, 1700, Castaing was arrested on charges of malversation, including using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins prior to their being reminted and stealing. According to the numismatist George E. Ewing, Jr., Castaing's accuser, Jacques Fournier de Saint Andre, was engaged in a conspiracy along with two Paris Mint guard judges, men named Maigret and Burgoing, with the intent of having Castaing wrongly convicted. Ewing states that Fournier desired Castaing's position as general manager, and Maigret wanted to evict the inventor, to whom he was obliged to rent an apartment near the Mint for the mandated price of 450 livres annually, so he could raise the rent. Castaing's wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch) was angered by the charges against her husband, petitioning Fournier to compensate them 10,000 livres for damages as well as offer an apology. She accused Fournier of being a \\"slanderer, impostor and an ignorant in money matters,\\" and charged that he and the two guard judges had threatened to cause harm to Castaing due to his actions at the mints, which caused them to lose 30,000 livres following the King's 1693 decree. Two years after his arrest, the lawsuit against him was dropped by the Council of State, and Castaing was released. Fournier was ordered to pay him 6,000 livres in damages, as well as three-fourths of trial expenses. Castaing died at some point in the early eighteenth century.

Stewart is the daughter of former Mayor of New Britain Tim Stewart, who served from 2003 to 2011. She was elected to her first term on November 5, 2013, at the age of 26, to become the youngest mayor in New Britain's history and the city's second female mayor.] Stewart was reelected to a second term on November 3, 2015, and a third term on November 7, 2017. As of 2015 she was the youngest serving female mayor in the United States for a city the size of New Britain. Stewart has been considered a rising star in the Connecticut Republican Party. In March 2018, after much speculation, she entered the race for Governor of Connecticut. However, her late entry caused problems with fundraising and accumulating delegate support, so she switched her campaign to one for lieutenant governor. She then lost the Republican primary for that race on August 14, coming in second against State Senator Joe Markley.  Early career  Stewart's political career began as a campaign staffer for former Congresswoman Nancy Johnson. Working alongside Congresswoman Johnson, Stewart worked directly with municipal political leaders for various candidates around the State of Connecticut and to develop campaign strategy. Stewart interned for Governor Jodi Rell’s Administration in the Office of Policy and Management, then in the Legislative Affairs Office. Before becoming mayor, Stewart worked as a legislative aide in the Connecticut General Assembly. Stewart was responsible for working on constituent problems for Kevin C. Kelly’s state senate district of 100,000 residents and providing research to the senator on state laws. While working at the Connecticut General Assembly, she was elected member of the city’s Board of Education.  Education  Stewart graduated from New Britain High School in 2005. She attended Central Connecticut State University, earning her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, with a specialization in Public Administration and a minor in Communications, in 2009.  Volunteerism  Stewart served as vice chairperson on the planning and budgeting subcommittee of New Britain’s Commission on Community and Neighborhood Development. She is also a Justice of the Peace. Stewart has raised awareness about breast cancer due to the death of an aunt who died from the disease in 1998 at the age of 51. For the past several years, Stewart has served with Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman as the honorary co-chair of the Connecticut Race in the Park, a race held to raise funds and awareness for the Connecticut Breast Health Initiative.  Board of Education  Elected to the Board of Education in November 2011, Stewart advocated for a return to neighborhood schools, greater parental engagement, and enhanced accountability measurements for teachers and administrators, while keeping costs down. While Stewart served on the Board, the Board expanded Pre-K to all day programing. At that time, the Board of Education also decided to outfit the classrooms with SMART Board technology. After less than two years, Erin Stewart stepped down from the Board of Education to campaign for mayor.  Mayor of New Britain  = Elections =  2013  On June 6, 2013, Stewart announced her intent to run for mayor. She was unopposed in the Republican primary. Stewart ran on a platform of government transparency and accountability while promising to restore financial health to the city in the face of a potential State takeover. On election day, Stewart beat the Democrat incumbent Tim O’Brien, 56-44%.  2015  During her 2015 campaign, Stewart received endorsements from the city's police and fire unions, along with Local 1186 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union consisting of more than 300 city employees. Stewart was elected to a second term on November 3, 2015, after beating both Democratic candidate John McNamara and petitioning candidate Alfred Mayo, garnering more than sixty-six percent of the vote. She became the first female elected New Britain mayor twice. Stewart’s ticket, which was a \\"fusion ticket\\", consisted of registered Republicans, Democrats and Independents. For the first time in 44 years, the Common Council had a Republican majority, accounting for twelve of the fifteen seats on the Council.  2017  On January 19, 2017, Stewart announced that she was seeking a third term.http://www.stewartfornb.com/text-mayor- stewarts-election-kickoff-speech/ In her re-election campaign, Stewart stressed the importance of economic development and committed to completing the \\"Complete Streets Master Plan\\". Stewart was re-elected on November 7, 2017, by defeating Board of Education member Merrill Gay 57.5% - 42.5%, becoming the first female mayor of the city to win a third term. = Tenure =  Budget and finances  During Stewart's tenure the city restored a structurally-balanced budget. A $30 million deficit was corrected with $16 million in spending cuts, cuts of 30 full-time jobs, and an 11 percent increase in taxes, while adding $14.9 million to the rainy day fund. The fiscal policy resulted in 4 bond-rating upgrades from Standard & Poor’s, three in January 2015, and one in January 2016.  Economic development  Costco was added to the city's list of top ten taxpayers in the fall of 2015. Business interest has been sparked by the opening of CTfastrak, New England’s first bus rapid transit system, which directly connects downtown New Britain with Connecticut’s capital city of Hartford. Both the city and the state are spending millions in transit-oriented development and seven phases of streetscape improvements, which are bringing increased commercial and residential development to New Britain. Stewart secured more than $12 million in both state and federal grants to help pay for the Complete Streetscape Master Plan.  New Britain Bees  New Britain has had a professional baseball team since 1983. In June 2014, the city’s longtime baseball team, the New Britain Rock Cats announced that they were moving to Hartford. After the announcement former Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch connected Stewart with Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, the owners of the Bridgeport Bluefish. After months of negotiations, Stewart received a commitment from the league to bring what would become the New Britain Bees to the city. Due to a lapse in contracts, New Britain was without baseball for one day.  Homelessness  Stewart has invested resources into helping New Britain’s homeless population through her creation of the Building Hope Together Task Force: New Britain’s Permanent Workplan to End Homelessness. Stewart secured $2.145 million to fund the construction of more than ten units of permanent supportive housing; connecting individuals to the services needed to get back on their feet. Veterans’ homelessness is another issue which Stewart has made a focal point of her tenure, providing access to services, supportive housing and critical care needed by veterans. Working closely with Veterans Inc., the City committed $205,000 to bring 18 units of veterans’ housing to New Britain.  Energy and innovation  Stewart committed to making New Britain a \\"green\\" community. Through her \\"Smart City Initiative,\\" Stewart spearheaded the largest solarization project in New Britain’s history, including a solar array at Shuttle Meadow Reservoir, as well as rooftop solar arrays on most school buildings. She is also taking steps to increase the use of LED technology in all City buildings and streetlights, to further reduce the City’s energy consumption, and is embarking on building the city’s first fuel cell. Stewart founded an Energy and Innovation Committee to oversee this initiative.  New media  Stewart has a monthly television show called Around New Britain with Mayor Stewart that airs on Nutmeg Television. It is also available on YouTube. In 2016, Stewart presented the first ever digital State of the City as way of transforming City Hall.  Political positions  Mayor Erin Stewart is a moderate Republican; she is a \\"self-described fiscal conservative who is moderate to liberal on social issues\\". During her tenure as mayor, she reduced the number of city employees and moderately raised taxes. Stewart proposed a 2018 budget for New Britain that did not raise taxes and did not increase school spending. Stewart is pro-choice on the issue of abortion and supports gun ownership and is a gun owner herself. She supports same-sex marriage. Stewart revealed in an interview that she has officiated at a same-sex marriage.  Awards and accolades  Stewart has received awards for her political service: * 2016: Newsmax's \\"50 Most Influential Female Republicans.\\" * 2016: Central Connecticut State University – Women of Influence Awardhttp://www.stewartfornb.com/ccsu-honors-mayor-stewart-with- women-of-influence-award/ * 2016: Newsmax named her at the top of their \\"30 Most Influential Republicans Under 30\\" list. * 2015: Central Connecticut State University – Young Alumni Service Award * 2015: Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence honored her with \\"First 100 Plus\\" * 2014: New Britain City Journal’s \\"Person of the Year\\" * 2014: Connecticut Magazine honorary, \\"Top 40 under 40\\" * 2013: Women in Leadership award from the Connecticut Republican Party. * 2007: Greater New Britain YWCA's Women in Leadership award for her work with the CT Breast Health Initiative.

He served for three terms, choosing not to seek reelection in 1967. Illinois House of Representatives The 1960 reapportionment process was stalled by partisan gridlock. Subsequently, the Illinois Supreme Court ordered an at large election for all 177 members of the Illinois House in 1964. Voters were given ballots three feet long. Giorgi was one of the winning 177 candidates that year. After a 1965 Illinois Supreme Court Case to resolve the redistricting issue, Giorgi's home was drawn into the 34th district, which consisted of southern Winnebago County. He was reelected as one of the district's three representatives alongside Republicans David W. Johnson and Frank P. North. His Rockford based district was renumbered several times. After the Cutback Amendment mandated single-member districts, he became the representative for the 68th district.

The interlocking design provides a way of maximising the space given to flats in any building volume by reducing the space needed for entrance corridors and providing a dual aspect for each dwelling. When used in high rise tower blocks , the scissor arrangement also makes the lift installation cheaper as a landing is only required every three levels. But the design does have accessibility issues and the complex arrangement has caused confusion for emergency services. The design Scissor section flats consist of interlocking designs and typically are a mixture of 'up' flats and 'down' flats. A view of Perronet House, London showing the distinctive 'half floor' arrangement between the internal walkways (shown by the end windows) and the accommodation floors (shown by the side windows) In an 'up' flat, you enter the flat from a central entrance corridor and go up a half-storey set of stairs to the first 'main' level of the flat, typically containing the living room and kitchen. From there a second half-storey set of stairs goes up to a level containing toilet and bathroom. This sits the storey level above the entrance corridor on the interior of the building, so these rooms have no natural light or ventilation. From the bathroom level a further half-storey set of stairs goes up to the second main level of the flat, typically containing bedrooms, which sits on the other side of the building from the living area. A final half-storey set of stairs leads up to the central corridor two storeys above the entrance, with a fire exit door to that corridor. A 'down' flat has the similar arrangement, but in reverse, with the entrance leading down to the living level, down to the bathroom level, down to the bedroom level and down to the corridor two storeys below. The result of this layout is that all flats have a dual aspect design, where each apartment faces out on both sides of the block. This maximises light, external views and ventilation for the occupants within a very compact layout. This design builds upon - but subtly differs from - the dual aspect arrangement of interlocking flats pioneered by Le Corbusier in the Unité d'habitation in Marseilles (and developed in London council housing designs such as Lakanal House) by arranging the rooms so that all the living accommodation is on one side of the block and all the bedroom accommodation on the other, minimising noise disruption between neighbours. The diagram shows how two scissor flats interact. The red flat is a 'down' flat - where you enter from the top entrance corridor, down stairs to living area, down to the bathroom area, down to the bedroom area and down to an emergency exit to the lower corridor. The blue flat is an 'up' flat with this arrangement in reverse. History The scissor section flat was developed by David Gregory-Jones and his team at LCC Architects department in 1956-57, with details of the design approach published in a technical article in 1962. An early use of the design was in the large riverside towers of the Pepys Estate in Deptford, and in a number of council housing schemes across London in the 1960s and early 1970s including Maydew House, Kelson House and Perronet House. Some similar designs for council tower blocks are found in other cities in England. Notable examples * Perronet House, designed by Sir Roger Walters, London SE1 * Aragon Tower, on the Pepys Estate, London SE8 * Corringham, designed by Kenneth Frampton, London W2 * Willoughby House on the Barbican Estate, designed by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, London EC2 * Westside, Fortis Green, London N2 designed by architect Colin Jones (allegedly the first building in which this arrangement was used) The scissor section design was also used extensively outside London, the Hutchesontown \\"B\\" tower blocks in Glasgow also employed the configuration. Criticism Some commentators have pointed out that the complex design of scissor section flats leads to a more complex, and costly, construction process while architects have pointed out that the use of so many flights of stairs and the half-storey design means that this form of layout would not meet modern building regulations around accessibility. The unusual layout of the flats and variety of layouts found in a building have caused confusion to the emergency services, and were identified as an contributory factor during the inquest into the death of two firemen fighting a fire in a scissor section flat in Southampton, England in 2010.

It is found in both still and flowing freshwater in Europe, Asia, Greenland and Africa. In North America it is found in most Canadian provinces with a seabord and most US states except the most southern . Description Flora Batava, 1846 F. antipyretica has branched, trailing stems that are triangular in cross-section and may be as long as . The leaves are quite stiff and are arranged in three overlapping rows. Each leaf is lance-shaped or egg-shaped, with a keel and a sharp point, some long. There are no flowers but minute spores are sometimes produced in smooth sporangia (capsules) between long. Distribution and habitat F. antipyretica is found in Europe, Asia and parts of Africa. It grows attached to submerged rocks in fast-flowing water. It also occurs attached to the substrate in lakes and as floating masses in still water, and may be cast up on beaches at the waterside. It thrives in shady positions and prefers acid water, a pH of around 8.4 being the maximum tolerated. It is replaced in highly acid mountain and moorland streams in the UK by Fontinalis squamosa. Biology Reproduction is mostly by stolons or by the rooting of detached fragments. Sexual reproduction does also occur, in the spring in North America, but is relatively unimportant as a means of reproduction. Individual plants are either male or female and the capsules housing the spores are seldom observed. Ecology F. antipyretica grows in large clumps and mats and provides refuge for fish eggs and fry. Numerous invertebrates shelter among the fronds; Chironomid larvae hide in the bases of the leaves and mayfly, caddisfly and stonefly larvae cling to the fronds, and in fast-flowing water black fly larvae are often present. Diatoms and other microscopic algae grow epiphytically on the fronds. Heavy metal adsorption It has been found that F. antipyretica can adsorb cadmium and zinc, with maximum biosorption of cadmium being per gram of dried moss, and of zinc (depending on water temperature). The biosorption of cadmium was unaffected by the hardness of the water but that of zinc was affected by rising calcium levels. Aquarium uses F. antipyretica was traditionally used in cool-water aquaria,William T. Innes, Exotic Aquarium Fishes, 19th ed. 1965:88. but in tropical aquaria the similarly-structured \\"Java moss\\" ( a Vesicularia species) takes its place.

On 6 January 2015, a group known as Thirrjet e nënave (The call of mothers), whose members are mostly mothers of victims from the Kosovo War, protested in front of the Orthodox Church in Gjakova before Christmas, to block adherents to enter, due to Serbia's ongoing refusal to apologise for the victims. Later that day, Aleksandar Jablanović, Minister of Communities and Returns and member of the Parliament of Kosovo branded as \\"savages\\" and \\"freaks\\" a group who stoned and blocked the way for buses driving displaced Serbs to Christmas mass in Gjakova. Most of Kosovo citizens were overwhelmingly offended, including the opposition who immediately asked for Jablanović's resignation. The protests after his statements began in Gjakova and continued until 17 January, where around 10,000 people turned to the city center. The demonstrations shortly expanded to Peć, Deçan, Gjilan, and the whole territory of Kosovo. On 19 January, Jablanović formally apologised for his statements. On 24 and 27 January 2015, national-level protests took place in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, where roughly 50,000 people turned to streets to demand Jablanović's resignation and the return of Trepča as a public institution of the Republic of Kosovo. However, the protests turned violent due to the clash with the police. It was internationally proclaimed as the worst unrest since 2008. On 3 February 2015, Prime Minister Isa Mustafa announced that Aleksandar Jablanović would no longer be part of the cabinet, and therefore his resignation was confirmed. His resignation was welcomed by the opposition and other citizens, but criticized by the Government of Serbia. Background Prior to the local and national protests and the formation of the new government on 9 December 2014, disapproval and anti-governmental actions had already started. At least 20,000 people from Kosovo, whose vast majority were youth, were instantly trying to illegally emigrate to the European Union, through Serbia and Hungary, due to the high unemployment rate. =Unemployment and illegal emigration= According to a 2014 report by the Kosovo Agency of Statistics, the unemployment rate in the country is 30%, of whom, the unemployment from the age of 15–24 is at 55.9%. Due to the high number of unemployment and the current poverty, roughly 50% of the emigrants were youth between the age of 15–24, who were seeking a better life in the European Union through illegal emigration. Most of them, would enter Serbia and then illegally move to Hungary. The situation gained national attention, and most citizens would blame the government, due to its failure to prevent the emigration and to shrink the unemployment rate. President Atifete Jahjaga and other government official expressed their concern. =Trepča status= On 14 January 2015, the Government of Kosovo passed a bill to the parliament to return the Trepča Mines, as a public institution of the Republic of Kosovo. The decision was revoked, due to the Serbian government threats; although the government had denied Serbia's intervention, by justifying the decision, saying that a similar move would leave thousands of people unemployed, and announced they would shortly return the mines as an institution of Kosovo. The move to revoke the bill was widely opposed by Kosovo's citizens and the Kosovan opposition, saying that it was damaging the sovereignty of Kosovo. At the following parliament sessions, opposition's reaction was extremely negative, with most of them, either leaving the assembly, or constantly threatening the position. United Kingdom's ambassador to the Republic of Kosovo, Ian Cliff said that \\"Trepça is a property of Kosovo\\", because it's located in the territory of Kosovo and should therefore be a public institution of the Republic. He was also against putting Trepča as a topic in the Belgrade–Pristina negotiations because it was a matter for Kosovo. =January protests= Kosovan opposition Vetëvendosje!, Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, Initiative for Kosovo, New Kosovo Alliance and others demanded Jablanović's resignation and the return of the Trepča Mines as a public institution of the Republic of Kosovo. They called for the first national-level protest on 24 January 2015, where thousands of protesters turned to streets, with the motto Jabllanoviq jashtë! Trepça është e jona! (Jablanovic out! Trepça is ours!). The building of the government was damaged. The vandalism was condemned by President Atifete Jahjaga. The second national- level protest was held at the Mother Teresa square in Pristina on 27 January, supported by Vetëvendosje, AAK, NISMA, Thirrjet e nënave, and most Kosovo Albanian citizens. It began as a quiet and peaceful demonstration with the same requests and motto as the first protest. However, it became very violent when protesters clashed with Kosovo Police. Shpend Ahmeti, Mayor of Pristina was arrested, although he was immediately freed, and other politicians as well. Prime Minister Isa Mustafa and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy PM Hashim Thaçi condemned the protests and the violence. Dozens of protesters were injured, and it was later confirmed that the Kosovo Police had used tear gas.

Sam Seneca, a soldier who had served in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, meets Amira Jafari when he visits her uncle, Bassam Jafari, who had served as Sam's Iraqi translator. Bassam and Sam have a special bond due to their time together in the war. Initially Amira does not trust him because he was an American soldier and her brother was killed by a bomb from American troops in the war. After getting fired from his job as a security guard for punishing a group of rude people, Sam's cousin, Charlie Seneca, asks Sam to help him with illegal hedge funds unbeknownst to Sam at the time. Amira is staying with her uncle Bassam since her father died. She sells bootlegged films on the street corner but is forced to flee after getting busted. Bassam calls Sam to inform him of what happened with Amira and asks him to let Amira stay with him. Sam agrees and goes to Amira and Bassam's apartment to get Amira. Amira tells Sam that she cannot go back to Iraq because it became to dangerous for her after her family started helping American soldiers and Bassam tried to claim her as a dependent but they had trouble with the courts so if Amira was arrested she would be deported to Iraq as an illegal immigrant. Although reluctant at first Amira eventually agrees to go and stay with Sam. Sam and Amira begin spending time together with both learning to enjoy the company of the other and slowly beginning to fall in love. While at a gathering with Charlie and his friends from work, Sam learns from one of Charlie's friends that Charlie's hedge funds that he has been helping Charlie with may be illegal. He confronts Charlie over it but Charlie denies this is the case. Back at Sam's apartment, Sam and Amira share a bed and Amira reveals that she read Sam's notebook of jokes that he had written when Sam hoped to become a stand up comedian but didn't do so well. After an exchange of words the two kiss but do not become too intimate. The next day at Charlie's invitation, Sam and Amira attend a party Charlie is having. While at the party Sam only becomes more suspicious of Charlie's hedge funds. Amira meanwhile faces certain degrees of racism. Particularly from Sam's Uncle Nick Seneca who tells Sam that he was in 4 World Trade Center when the September 11 attacks occurred and watched three of his friends die when the Twin Towers were hit with planes. Not wanting to be involved in Charlie's hedge funds and displeased with the party and guests Sam decides to leave. Charlie tries to stop him which results in a brief scuffle between the two cousins. Amira attempts to intervene but unintentionally hits Charlie's pregnant wife Claire Seneca in the commotion. Sam and Amira leave the party and head back to Sam's apartment. After sharing a moment of passion, Sam and Amira have sex. The next morning, two police officers arrive and arrest Amira saying that she's being charged with assaulting Claire. Bassam arrives at the police station where Sam is already waiting. One of the police officers involved in the arrest informs Sam and Bassam that it was revealed that Amira is an illegal immigrant and will be released on bail tomorrow and will be deported back to Iraq the day after. Sam meets with Charlie later where Sam tells him that Amira is being deported. Although Charlie says that he'll have Claire drop the charges Sam tells him it's too late and again asks Charlie about his hedge funds. Charlie comes clean and confirms that they are illegal but that he's rigged the system so that no one would ever find out about it. Later that night, Amira calls Sam from Jail and confesses her love for him and asks to spend one last day together with him. The next day, Sam comes over to Bassam and Amira's apartment where Bassam says that he is going back to Iraq with Amira to look after her despite Amira's protests. Bassam asks Sam to leave but Amira firmly states that she's spending her last day with Sam. The two go out and enjoy an entire day of passion. At the end of the day Amira asks Sam to try his luck at stand up comedy for her. He does so and has good success. On stage Sam confesses his love for Amira and asks her in Arabic to run away together with him. Amira agrees and asks where but Sam says that he doesn't know and doesn't care. The next day, without Sam's help Charlie's hedge funds don't go through and Sam and Amira leave a note for Bassam. Sam and Amira tell Bassam that they are leaving New York City to be together and avoid Amira's deportation and that they will be in touch as soon as they settle down somewhere else. Bassam smiles happily understanding Sam and Amira's love and knowing that he and Amira will not have to go back to Iraq. Sam and Amira are then seen leaving New York City looking forward to a bright future together.

Background Mullin, a former member of the New York Army National Guard, had performed stand-up comedy and was a first responder in the September 11 attacks. He decided to create the film after hearing about friends in the U.S. military trying to get asylum for their Iraqi translators. Production Much of the film was shot on Staten Island. Shihabi and Naikli used an Iraqi dialect coach, one of Nakli's friends, to refine their Arabic. Shihabi's native dialect is a form of Levantine Arabic while she used Iraqi Arabic in the film. Nakli also served as an associate producer in recognition of the contributions he made to the film. The director, Mullin, used suggestions from the actors to shape the film and there were periods where actors improvised. At the end of the movie, the song \\"Havre de Grace\\" by Zerobridge was played. Release The release was scheduled for early 2015. A limited theatrical release was planned, scheduled for January 30, 2015. A video on demand release was scheduled for the same day.Rich, Katey. \\"This Is the Best Way to Ruin a Date at the Movies\\" (Archive). Vanity Fair. January 27, 2015. Retrieved on January 28, 2015.
