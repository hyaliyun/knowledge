Trovillion (1879‚Äì1967) were publishers based in Herrin, Illinois who operated local newspapers and a private press known as Trovillion Private Press at the Sign of the Silver Horse or simply Trovillion Press.  History  In 1904, after Hal left Indiana University, he moved to Herrin and took over two local newspapers, The Herrin Daily Journal and the Egyptian Republican (previously named The Herrin News). In 1908, influenced by Thomas Bird Mosher, he started private press publication. Mosher's work was notable for small size, attractive design, high-quality paper and affordable prices, and Trovillion emulated these practices. Works were typically published in editions of a few hundred copies, on fine handmade European papers, with titles printed in gilt or on paper title cards. Usually every copy was numbered, and hand-signed by both of the Trovillions. The books were almost all short, under 100 pages and often under 50 pages. Some of the pieces published were by lesser-known works by well- known authors, and sometimes were short pieces typically published as part of larger work. Some of the books were reprints of historical works, generally from the 17th century. A number of books concerning gardening were published, including a reprint of a gardening book from 1617. Some of the works published were by the Trovillions, and some concerned running private presses. The University of Missouri Library System reports that fifty books were published from 1908 through 1958 , and also reports that operations ceased in 1958, though at least one work bears a copyright date of 1960. They also note that the Trovillions sometimes used \\"Thatchcot\\", the name of their home, as an imprint. Publications Publications include: * Vagaries by Munthe, by Axel Munthe, 1925, 43p, edition of 221 copies.

The Trovillion press archives are at the Morris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. Sundial In the early 1930s, the Trovillions purchased an elaborate hand- hammered copper armillary-style sundial in Stockholm, Sweden and installed it in their back yard in Herrin. In July 2005, the sundial was stolen from the yard (both owned by John Fisher). Fisher offered a $1000 reward for its return. The theft was decidedly odd due to the significant weight of the sundial and the difficulty of removing it from its concrete base.

Background The Third War of Religion saw an uprising of the Protestants and the creation of an army under the command of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Cond√©. This army had laid siege to several cities in the Poitou region, and then Angoul√™me and Cognac. At the Battle of Jarnac (16 March 1569), the Prince de Cond√© was killed, forcing Admiral de Coligny to take command. In order to attack the royal army, Coligny directed the Protestant army toward the Limousin region, hoping thus to regroup with 14,000 mercenaries being led by the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken () and financed by Queen Elizabeth I of England.Jouanna, p.181. After a brief fight with a detachment of the royal army, the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken was able to cross the Vienne at Aixe, but died on 11 June at Nexon. The Protestant army and the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken's mercenaries were able to regroup at Ch√¢lus, for a total of 25,000 men. The royal army of 29,500 troops, led by the Duke d‚ÄôAnjou (the future Henry III) were stationed before Saint-Yrieix to protect the city. The battle The Protestant army surprised the royal troops, and this gave them the initial advantage. The colonel-general of the royal infantry, Philippe Strozzi, was however able to temporarily save the situation, before an attack by Coligny - threatening to encircle the army - forced the royal troops to retreat before the Protestants. Aftermath Coligny's victory was far from being decisive, but it allowed him to open a route toward the P√©rigord region. The Protestant army took few prisoners, the most famous being the colonel-general Philippe Strozzi. In the days that followed, the Protestant army massacred hundreds of people throughout the Limousin and P√©rigord regions, including 500 infantry men at La Roche-l'Abeille and 250 peasants at La Chapelle-Faucher,Jouanna, p.183-4. as retribution for the death of Cond√© and Paulon de Mauvans. In autumn the same year, the Battle of Moncontour (30 October 1569) would see the Huguenots defeated and Catholic forces participating in similar massacres against the defeated.

A native of New York state, he traveled the Oregon Trail to the Willamette Valley and settled first in Oregon City and later in what became Washington. He was served on the Second Executive Committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon, and his homesite became part of Fort Canby at the mouth of the Columbia River. Early life Peter G. Stewart was born in Stamford, New York, on September 6, 1809. Then in 1817, he moved to Jefferson, New York, then to Middleburgh, New York, and then in 1840 to Springfield, Missouri. During this time Stewart worked as jeweler and watchmaker, and married Rebecca Rawlings Cason on September 1, 1842, in Missouri. Cason was born in 1826 in Virginia. Oregon Trail On May 22, 1843, the Stewart party left Independence, Missouri with two wagons in the \\"Great Migration\\" of that year. The Stewart party included his new wife and his in-laws traveled as they traveled over the Oregon Trail. On the journey Stewart is credited with helping fellow immigrant James W. Nesmith with rescuing William Vaughn from drowning while crossing the Kaw River. Also in this wagon train were other prominent people of the era. This includes Doctor Marcus Whitman from the mission near Walla Walla, Washington and Jesse Applegate who would soon open the Applegate Trail with his brothers.Oregon State Library Additionally, along the journey the party encountered Lieutenant John C. Fr√©mont of the United States Army, who was on a surveying mission. Oregon Country Stewart arrived in the Oregon Country in 1843. After a short time in Oregon, Stewart volunteered to help rescue the Joel Palmer wagon train in 1845. In 1850 while living in Oregon City, Stewart purchased part of the townsite of Pacific City in what was then Lewis County from Elijah White. There he built an \\"iron house\\" and saw mill at this site near the entrance of the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean and Cape Disappointment, near the present-day Ilwaco, Washington. By 1853 he was part owner of the Pacific Steam Saw Mill Company at that site. Later in 1853 the United States government took the property to use as a light house, and to use as military installation, Fort Canby. At that time the government did not pay Stewart as he only had squatter's rights to the land, but later at the age of 82 he petitioned the state of Washington who then sent a memorial to Congress to ask the Federal Government to appropriate funds for Stewart's benefit. Oregon then did the same, and Oregon Senator John H. Mitchell introduced a bill to pay Stewart for the property in 1891. In 1899 Peter Stewart was then paid $7,500 for the loss of his property by the United States government. After Pacific City, he returned to the jewelry and watch making business. Stewart plied this trade in Oregon City from 1854 to 1860. Then in 1861 he moved to Portland, Oregon where he and his business were burned out in 1862 and again in 1873. In between fires, Peter Stewart's wife died in 1863, and he then remarried in 1872 to Eliza Rosecrans. Years later Peter Stewart moved to Tacoma, Washington where he died August 27, 1900, at the age of 90. Government In May 1844, Stewart was elected by the pioneer settlers to the Second Executive Committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon. He received 140 votes to finish second in the voting and receive one of the three positions along with Osborne Russell and William J. Bailey. Peter Stewart served on the Executive Committee from May 25, 1844 to July 14, 1845.Oregon Blue Book: Earliest Authorities in Oregon This committee was then replaced with a single executive and George Abernethy was elected as governor.Oregon State Archives: Governor's Records Guides He was then chosen to be the first judge for the District Court of Clackamas County, Oregon. Then in 1853 he served as surveyor for the community of Pacific City. Lastly, from 1870 to 1879 Stewart served as city recorder for the town of Gervais in the Willamette Valley on French Prairie. Family Stewart's first wife Rebecca's parents were Fendal Carr Cason, a member of the Oregon Territorial Legislature, and Rebecca Holladay Cason. Oregon's first territorial recorder, John Long, was Stewart's brother-in-law. Peter fathered nine children, all by his first wife: Nellie, Margaret, Frederick, James, Katherine, Charles, Catherine, Mary, and George. Catherine died on the journey over the Oregon Trail and Nellie, born in 1863, was the youngest.

An annual \\"Trausteinmesse,\\" a special Mass, is celebrated at the end of summer. First Pyramidekogel tower A observation and broadcasting tower of steel and concrete, the Pyramidenkogel Tower, was built between 1966 and 1968 and was a well-known \\"futuristic\\" tourist attraction, according to the Rough Guide to Austria; Lonely Planet calls it \\"avant-garde.\\" In 2008, the last summer season before construction of a new edifice, the tower welcomed the five-millionth visitor. Current tower In July 2006, plans were made to tear down the existing tower and replace it with a new building, a multi-purpose activity centre, which was approved in 2007 and for which the Carinthian government set aside ‚Ç¨10 million in 2008. A competition for the new design was started in 2007; the architectural firm of Klaura & Kaden won the competition. Construction was to have begun by late 2008, and the old tower was imploded in October 2008, but financial and political difficulties prevented any new construction. The new tower, finished in 2013, was described by Dietmar Kaden as a \\"Himmelsleiter aus gestapelten Ellipsen,\\" a ladder into heaven made of stacked ellipses, and is to function as a \\"Leuchtturm der Holzbranche,\\" a lighthouse for the timber industry. No name has been decided on; Markus Klaura has proposed \\"Isis Noreia,\\" for the goddesses Isis and Noreia (the latter a Germanic deity, the Roman equivalent of Isis). The new tower is built of wood and steel, and at a height of 100 metres it is the tallest wooden observation tower in the world.

Interfaith marriage in Judaism (also called mixed marriage or intermarriage) was historically looked upon with very strong disfavour by Jewish leaders, and it remains a controversial issue among them today. In the Talmud and all of resulting Jewish law until the advent of new Jewish movements following the Jewish Enlightenment, the \\"Haskala\\", marriage between a Jew and a gentile is both prohibited, and also void under Jewish law.Kiddushin 68b A 2013 survey conducted in the United States by the Pew Research Center‚Äôs Religion & Public Life Project found the intermarriage rate to be 58% among all Jews and 71% among non-Orthodox Jews. Later laws and rulings The Talmud holds that a marriage between a Jew and a non Jew is both prohibited and also does not constitute a marriage under Jewish law. Furthermore, a Jewish man has no recognized paternal or parental relation to any offspring resulting from a relationship with a gentile woman. Interfaith marriage between a Jew and a non Jew is not even permitted in case of Pikuach nefesh.Yehuda Shurpin: How Could Esther Marry a Non-Jewish King?, Chabad.org. Esther's marriage with the king of Persia is, however, not regarded as a violation against this, because she remained passive, and risked her life to save that of the entire Jewish people.Yehuda Shurpin: How Could Esther Marry a Non-Jewish King?, Chabad.org. Christian rulers regarded unions between Jews and Christians unfavourably, and repeatedly prohibited them under penalty of death.Codex Theodosianus, 16:8, 6Heinrich Gr√§tz, Geschichte der Juden (=History of the Jews) 4:363; 5:359; 7;27Leopold L√∂w, Gesammelte Werke, 2:176 Gradually, however, many countries removed these restrictions, and marriage between Jews and Christians (and Muslims) began to occur. In 1236 Moses of Coucy induced the Jews bespoused by such marriages to dissolve them.Moses of Coucy, Sefer Mitzvot ha-Gadol, 112 In 1807, Napoleon's Grand Sanhedrin declared that such marriages although not valid under Jewish law were civilly valid and should not be treated as anathema. In 1844, the 1807 ruling was extended by the Rabbinical Conference of Brunswick to include any adherent of a monotheistic religion, but they also altered it to forbid marriages involving those who lived in states that would prevent children of the marriage from being raised Jewish. This conference was highly controversial; one of its resolutions called on its members to abolish the Kol Nidre prayer, which opens the Yom Kippur service.Jewish Encyclopedia, \\"Conferences, Rabbinical\\" One member of the Brunswick Conference later changed his opinion, becoming an opponent of intermarriage.Ludwig Philippson, Israelitische Religionslehre (1865), 3:350 Traditional Judaism does not consider marriage between a Jew by birth and a convert as an intermarriage.Berakhot 28aRabbi Yosef Karo, Shulchan Aruch III:4:10 Hence, all the Biblical passages that appear to support intermarriages, such as that of Joseph to Asenath, and that of Ruth to Boaz, were regarded by the classical rabbis as having occurred only after the foreign spouse had converted to Judaism.Genesis Rabbah, 65 Some opinions, however, still considered Canaanites forbidden to marry even after conversion; this did not necessarily apply to their children.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sanctity, Laws of Prohibited Relations, 12:22 and Maggid Mashnah ad. loc. The Shulchan Aruch and its commentariesIII:16:2 bring various opinions as to when intermarriage is a Torah prohibition and when the prohibition is rabbinic. A foundling ‚Äì a person who was abandoned as a child without their parents being identified ‚Äì was classified as a non-Jew, in relation to intermarriage, if they had been found in an area where at least one non-Jew lived (even if there were hundreds of Jews in the area, and just one non-Jew); this drastically contrasts with the treatment by other areas of Jewish religion, in which a foundling was classified as Jewish if the majority of the people were Jewish in the area in which the foundling was found. If the mother was known, but not the father, the child was treated as a foundling, unless the mother claimed that the child was an Israelite (the claim would be given the benefit of the doubt).Ketubot 13aKiddushin 74aKetubot (Palestinian Talmud only) 1:9 Modern attitudes The Talmud and later classical sources of Jewish law are clear that the institution of Jewish marriage, kiddushin, can only be affected between Jews. The more liberal Jewish movements‚Äîincluding Reform, Reconstructionist (collectively organized in the World Union for Progressive Judaism)‚Äîdo not generally regard the historic corpus and process of Jewish law as intrinsically binding. Progressive rabbinical associations have no firm prohibition against intermarriage; according to a survey of rabbis, conducted in 1985, more than 87% of Reconstructionist rabbis were willing to officiate at interfaith marriages,Survey of the American Rabbinate, The Jewish Outreach Institute, (retrieved 6 May 2009) and in 2003 at least 50% of Reform rabbis were willing to perform interfaith marriages.Summary of Rabbinic Center for Research and Counseling 2003 Survey, Irwin H. Fishbein, Rabbi, D. Min., Rabbinic Center for Research and Counseling, (retrieved 6 May 2009) The Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Reform rabbinical association in North America and the largest Progressive rabbinical association, consistently opposed intermarriage at least until the 1980s, including their members officiating at them, through resolutions and responsa.Reform Judaism and Mixed Marriage CCAR Responsa (Vol. XC, 1980, pp. 86‚Äì102), American Reform Responsa 146.Rabbi Officiating at a Mixed Marriage CCAR Responsa (Vol. XCII, 1982, pp. 213‚Äì215), American Reform Responsa 149.Prayer for Couple Contemplating Intermarriage CCAR Responsa (1979), American Reform Responsa 147. In 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners. Humanistic Judaism is a Jewish movement that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life, and defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people. The Society for Humanistic Judaism answers the question \\"Is intermarriage contributing to the demise of Judaism?\\" on its website, stating, \\"Intermarriage is the positive consequence of a free and open society. If the Jewish community is open, welcoming, embracing, and pluralistic, we will encourage more people to identify with the Jewish people rather than fewer. Intermarriage could contribute to the continuity of the Jewish people.\\" The largest Reform Synagogue in New York- Central Synagogue, performs \\"interfaith\\" marriages. Such marriages are conducted to strengthen Jewish continuity (with the aim that the non-Jewish spouse will convert to Judaism). The 2013 study by Pew Research \\"What happens when Jews intermarry?\\" found that children of intermarriage are much more likely to intermarry themselves and much more likely than people with two Jewish parents to describe themselves religiously as atheist, agnostic or just ‚Äúnothing in particular.‚Äù The Study \\"also suggests\\" that an increasing percentage of the children of intermarriages are Jewish in adulthood. Among Americans age 65 and older who at the time of the survey said they had one Jewish parent, 25% were Jewish. By contrast, among adults under 30 with one Jewish parent, 59% were Jewish at the time of the survey. Therefore \\"in this sense, intermarriage may be transmitting Jewish identity to a growing number of Americans.\\". The survey qualifies that \\"it is snapshot in time and shows show associations, or linkages, rather than clear causal connections\\" and it is unknown \\"whether the large cohort of young adult children of intermarriage who are Jewish today will remain Jewish as they age, marry (and in some cases, intermarry), start families and move through the life cycle\\". All branches of Orthodox Judaism follow the historic Jewish attitudes to intermarriage, and therefore refuse to accept that intermarriages would have any validity or legitimacy, and strictly forbid sexual intercourse with a member of a different faith. Orthodox rabbis refuse to officiate at interfaith weddings, and also try to avoid assisting them in other ways. Secular intermarriage is seen as a deliberate rejection of Judaism, and an intermarried person is effectively cut off from most of the Orthodox community, although some Chabad-Lubavitch and Modern Orthodox Jews do reach out to intermarried Jews, especially Jewish women (because Orthodox Jewish law considers the children of Jewish women to be Jews regardless of the father's status). The Conservative Movement in Judaism does not sanction or recognize the Jewish legal validity of intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to the spouse's conversion to Judaism. The Rabbinical Assembly Standards of Rabbinic Practice prohibit Conservative rabbis from officiating at intermarriages. In 1995 the Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism published the following statement on intermarriage: :In the past, intermarriage... was viewed as an act of rebellion, a rejection of Judaism. Jews who intermarried were essentially excommunicated. But now, intermarriage is often the result of living in an open society... If our children end up marrying non-Jews, we should not reject them. We should continue to give our love and by that retain a measure of influence in their lives, Jewishly and otherwise. Life consists of constant growth and our adult children may yet reach a stage when Judaism has new meaning for them. However, the marriage between a Jew and non-Jew is not a celebration for the Jewish community.....Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism, Statement on Intermarriage, Adopted on 7 March 1995 The exact definition of 'interfaith' marriage Different movements in Judaism have different views on who is a Jew, and thus on what constitutes an interfaith marriage. Unlike Reform Judaism, the Orthodox stream does not accept as Jewish a person whose mother is not Jewish, nor a convert whose conversion was not performed according to classical Jewish law Although Conservative Judaism has not formally accepted patrilineal descent as of yet, it is making moves in that direction; moreover a majority of Conservative rabbis will accept Reform conversions even absent traditional halachic criteria. Occasionally, a Jew marries a non-Jew who believes in God as understood by Judaism, and who rejects non-Jewish theologies; Jews sometimes call such people Noahides. Steven Greenberg, an Orthodox Rabbi, has made the controversial proposal that, in these cases, the non-Jewish partner be considered a resident alien ‚Äì the biblical description of someone who is not Jewish, but who lives within the Jewish community; according to Jewish tradition, such resident aliens share many of the same responsibilities and privileges as the Jewish community in which they reside. Impact and consequences In the early 19th century, in some less modernised regions of the world, exogamy was extremely rare‚Äîless than 0.1% of the Jews of Algeria, for example, practiced exogamy.Ricoux, Demography of Algeria, Paris, 1860, p. 71 In the early 20th century, even in most Germanic regions of central EuropePrussia, Bavaria, Austria, Bohemia, etc. there were still only a mere 5% of Jews marrying non-Jews.Census for Prussian Statistics, 1902, p. 216Census of the Baverian Kingdom, Statistics Bureaux, 1900, p. 259Statebook of Austria 8:283, Vienna, 1900 However, the picture was quite different in other locations; the figure was 18% for Berlin,Statistics Yearbook, 1902, p. 61 and during the same period, nearly half of all Jews in Australia intermarried.specifically, 44% in New South Wales; Census of New South Wales, 1901, Bulletin No. 14 In more recent times, rates of intermarriage have increased generally; for example, the US National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01 reports that, in the United States of America between 1996 and 2001, nearly half (47%) of Jews who had married during that time period had married non-Jewish partners. The 1990 National Jewish Population Survey reported an intermarriage rate of 52 percent among American Jews. The possibility that this might lead to the gradual dying out of Judaism is regarded by most Jewish leaders, regardless of denomination, as precipitating a crisis. For this reason, as early as the mid 19th century, some senior Jewish leaders denounced intermarriage as a danger to the continued existence of Judaism.Geiger and Aub,Leipsic Synod 1869; Referate √ºber die der Ersten Synode Gestellten Antr√§ge p. 193 In the United States of America, other causes, such as more people marrying later in life, have combined with intermarriage to cause the Jewish community to decrease dramatically; for every 20 adult Jews, there are now only 17 Jewish children. Some religious conservatives now even speak metaphorically of intermarriage as a silent holocaust. On the other hand, more tolerant and liberal Jews embrace interfaith marriage as an enriching contribution to a multicultural society. Regardless of attitudes to intermarriage, there is now an increasing effort to reach out to descendants of intermarried parents, each Jewish denomination focusing on those it defines as Jewish; secular and non-denominational Jewish organisations have sprung up to bring the descendants of intermarried parents back into the Jewish fold. In some cases, children of a Jewish parent were raised in the non-Jewish parent's religion while maintaining a sense of Jewish ethnicity and identity. Christian‚ÄìJewish relations In Christian‚ÄìJewish relations, interfaith marriage and the associated phenomenon of Jewish assimilation are a matter of concern for both Jewish and Christian leaders. Most mainstream Christian churches accept and may even promote the conversion of Jews. However, a number of Progressive Christian denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer adhere to this practice. These churches embrace dual-covenant theology.Ecumenical Considerations on Jewish-Christian Dialogue (World Council of Churches)Policies of mainline and liberal Christians towards proselytizing Jews (religioustolerance.org) Additionally, Jewish counter-missionary and anti-missionary organizations like Outreach Judaism encourage Jews to reject conversion to Christianity, while Messianic Jewish organizations like Jews for Jesus actively work to encourage it.David Cho, \\"Conversion Outreach Plan Stirs Outrage: Jews for Jesus Trains 600 for Street Work\\", The Washington Post, 17 August 2004; Page B01 full text  Israeli opposition to mixed marriages  Many Israeli Jews oppose mixed relationships,Judy Maltz (2 June 2014), \\"Why interfaith marriage is on the rise in Israel - and why it's a problem\\", Haaretz particularly relationships between Jewish women and non-Jewish Arab men. A 2007 opinion survey found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage is equivalent to \\"national treason\\". A group of Jewish men, known as \\"Lehava\\", in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Pisgat Ze'ev started patrolling the neighborhood in an effort to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of Petah Tikva has also announced an initiative to prevent interfaith relationships, providing a telephone hotline for friends and family to \\"inform\\" on Jewish girls who date Arab men as well as psychologists to provide counselling. The city of Kiryat Gat launched a school programme in schools to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men. In 2005, Ben-Zion Gopstein, a disciple of the ultra-nationalist Meir Kahane, founded the anti-miscegenation organisation Lehava. The group's name is an acronym for ‚ÄúTo Prevent Assimilation in the Holy Land‚Äù. In November 2019, Gopstein was indicted on charges of incitement to terrorism, violence, and racism.

Nikarete operated a \\"bettering\\" establishment in Corinth, a city famous in antiquity for its prostitution trade. From Corinth and Greek literature comes the verb korinthiazein, which loosely translated means \\"to fornicate\\". Nikarete is said to be a freedwoman, who was previously owned by a man called Charisios. When she gained her freedom, she married Charisios' cook and moved to Corinth. Nikarete bought young girls from the Corinthian slave market and trained them as hetaera, to let them make their own living. According to Apollodorus, it was her custom to rent out her hetaeras during their prime, then sold them off, which implied a 100-percent manumission rate. Through a kind of parental relationship Nikarete sought to increase the price her customers had to pay (free women were usually higher in demand). Nikarete's most famous hetaera Neaira, for instance, whom she bought along with six other girls was marketed as her own daughter so that she commanded higher prices. It was during the lawsuit Against Neaira that Nikarete's activities further gained notoriety as the younger hetaera described her life to fight against accusations that she illegally married an Athenian man. There is a possibility that Nikarete was not a single individual or even a real person. The name Nikarete has either been attributed to artistic interpretation or to an error in referring to different individuals (Neaira or Nicarete of Megara).

It provides high levels of support for audio routing, video routing and camera control. The protocol was developed by Philips Projects (now Tyco Integrated Systems) on behalf of the Traffic Control Systems Unit (TCSU), now a part of Transport for London (TfL). Tyco acts as the standards and approvals house for companies who want to implement the protocol. The protocol's roots can be traced back to the Highways Agency HDLC standard. It is the property of TfL and is independent of any supplier. As of late of 2011 there are at least eight manufacturers who have a partial or full TVNP interface, including: * BAE Systems (previously Petards) * Chubb (previously Initial Fire and Security) * Honeywell * Infinitronix * Meyertech * Costain (previously Simulation Systems Limited)http://www.costain.com/news/news-releases/acquisition-of-simulation- systems-limited-ssl/ * Synectics * Tyco (previously Philips Projects). TVNP layers are broadly based on the OSI model. TVNP Layer 2 and 3 correspond to OSI Layers 2 and 3. When used over RS232 only, TVNP Layer 1 corresponds to OSI Layer 1. TVNP Layer 4 is equivalent to OSI Layer 7. Structuring the TVNP in such a way means that as future needs and provisions change, aspects of one layer can be enhanced or modified without the need for change to the other layers. Layer 1 (L1) For serial RS232 L1 is the Physical Protocol Layer that defines the electrical signals and interconnect requirements at the communication interface port(s) of the CCTV system. V3.0 of the specification allows UDP/IP, typically over Ethernet, to be used for L1. This option is not a physical protocol layer in the OSI sense. Layer 2 (L2) is the Frame Protocol Layer, sometimes referred to as the Link Layer. Its purpose is to detect and correct errors in the stream of data passing between any two adjacent CCTV systems, so that CCTV network messages are not received in a corrupted form. Layer 2 operates strictly on point-to-point links between adjacent sites and contains no source or destination address information. Layer 3 (L3) is the Network Protocol Layer, sometimes referred to as the Packet Layer. This is the layer of actual CCTV network messages. The messages have end-to-end significance and contain both source and destination address information. Layer 4 (L4) is the Application Protocol Layer which makes use of the data network and lower protocol layers to provide services that are required either directly by the users of the system or for system management.

The boys sail to the fictional tropical island of Rhum-Boogie to find the tree. When they arrive they are captured by the natives and will be eaten unless Curly marries the Chief's ugly sister. The Stooges manage to escape with the tree and, after a confrontation with an alligator, sail off with their prize. Production notes Some More of Samoa was filmed on May 12‚Äì15, 1941. The film's title is a self-contained pun, as \\"Samoa\\" is pronounced similarly to slurring \\"some more of\\" as \\"some mo' o'\\". The film is set on the fictional island of Rhum Boogie, not Samoa. There are several continuity errors in Some More of Samoa. When Curly runs into the king‚Äôs hut he is still covered with the white powder draped on him from when a tribesman is preparing the Stooges for dinner, but when he goes into the hut and tangles with the Kabuki mask, the powder is gone. After he grabs the tree and runs off, the powder is back on. In addition, when Curly puts his head in the bag to answer the telephone, he starts whining before Moe actually closes the bag on his neck. When Moe and Larry run into the king and he introduces himself as \\"King Fish\\" they reply with an Amos 'n Andy joke routine. Kingfish was a recurring character in the Amos 'n Andy radio show. Some More of Samoa features a recurring gag often shown when the Stooges portray doctors or are mixing drinks, as in the films Men In Black and All Gummed Up. They stand in an assembly line formation and the first member (usually Moe) calls for a series of complex, often gibberish- sounding surgical tools or drink ingredients, with the other two repeating the orders and passing them to him. At a certain point, Moe will call for cotton, and be ignored at first, then angrily call for it again, prompting one of the other Stooges to retaliate and throw a large wad of wet cotton at Moe's face.

Its entirely free-standing firn-capped summit forms the main peak of the Fusch/Kaprun chain and is often viewed in Alpine literature as a rival of the Gro√üglockner. The great slope on its eastern and southeastern side plunges about 2,300 metres to the Fuscher Ache - one of the greatest height differences between mountaintop and valley floor in the Eastern Alps. Of alpinistic significance was the first ascent of the Northwest Face (Nordwestwand) on 15 July 1924 by Franz Riegele and Willo Welzenbach. They were the first ones to use ice nails (Eisn√§gel) to assist them; these were later developed into the ice screws used today. The Northwest Face was one of the classic ice walls of the Eastern Alps; the ice has since melted, however.  Location and area  The Gro√ües Wiesbachhorn is almost entirely surrounded by glaciers. To the north is the Wielingerkees, to the northeast the Sandbodenkees flows eastwards and down into the Sandboden and further into the Fuscher Ache. To the south lies the Teufelsm√ºhlkees und im Westen das Kaindlkees. An important neighbouring mountain to the north, separated by the 3,211-metre-high wind gap of the Sandbodenscharte, is the Kleines Wiesbachhorn with a height of 3,286 metres. To the southwest, on the other side of the 3,265-metre-high Wielingerscharte, between the Kaindlkees and Teufelsm√ºhlkees glaciers, lies the two Bratschenk√∂pfe peaks (3,413 and 3,401 metres high). To the west the terrain falls away to the Mooserboden Reservoir, to the east into the Fuscher Tal. The nearest important settlement is Fusch an der Gro√üglocknerstra√üe, about 10 kilometres away to the north as the crow flies.  Ascents  The route originally used by the Fusch farmers at the end of the 18th century is rarely used today. It runs from Ferleiten and takes 3¬Ω hours to reach the Schwarzenberg Hut and from there another 4 hours past the Bratschenk√∂pfe peaks to the summit of the Horn.Eduard Richter: Die Erschliessung der Ostalpen, Vol III, Berlin 1894, p. 208 ff. The usual present-day start point for ascents is the Heinrich Schwaiger Haus. From there the standard route runs over the Oberen Fochezkopf and along the Kaindlgrat ridge to the summit in about 3 hours. In the middle section of the route there is a 35¬∞ inclined firn edge (Firnschneide), the rock sections are rated at climbing grade UIAA I. The classic routes through the 500-metre-high Nordwest Face required ice climbing skills capable of coping with up to 60¬∞ gradients.Willi End: Alpenvereinsf√ºhrer Glocknergruppe, Munich, 2003, p. 434 ff., Rz 1590 ff.

Also known as entitlement spending, in US fiscal policy, mandatory spending is government spending on certain programs that are required by law. Congress established mandatory programs under authorization laws. Congress legislates spending for mandatory programs outside of the annual appropriations bill process. Congress can only reduce the funding for programs by changing the authorization law itself. This requires a 60-vote majority in the Senate to pass. Discretionary spending on the other hand will not occur unless Congress acts each year to provide the funding through an appropriations bill. Mandatory spending has taken up a larger share of the federal budget over time. In fiscal year (FY) 1965, mandatory spending accounted for 5.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). In FY 2016, mandatory spending accounted for about 60 percent of the federal budget and over 13 percent of GDP. Mandatory spending received $2.4 trillion of the total $3.9 trillion of federal spending in 2016. Entitlement programs Mandatory Spending for FY 2016 The bulk of mandatory spending is for entitlement programs, which are social welfare programs with specific requirements. Congress sets eligibility requirements and benefits for entitlement programs. If the eligibility requirements are met for a specific mandatory program, outlays are made automatically. Entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare make up the bulk of mandatory spending. Together they account for nearly 50 percent of the federal budget. Other mandatory spending programs include Income Security Programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Unemployment Insurance. Federal Retirement programs for Federal and Civilian Military Retirees, Veterans programs, and various other programs that provide agricultural subsidies are also included in mandatory spending. Also included is smaller budgetary items, such as the salaries of Members of Congress and the President. The graph to the right shows a breakdown on the percent of mandatory spending each entitlement program receives. Eligibility rules Many mandatory spending programs spending levels are determined by eligibility rules. Congress sets criteria for determining who is eligible to receive benefits from the program, and the benefit level for people who are eligible. The amount of money spent on each program each year is determined by how many people are eligible and apply for benefits. Congress does not decide each year to increase or decrease the budget for Social Security or other earned benefit programs. Some mandatory spending programs are in effect indefinitely, but some, like agriculture programs, expire at the end of a given period. Legislation that affects mandatory spending is subject to House and Senate points of order. Congress can periodically review the eligibility rules and may change them in order to include or exclude more people or offer more or less generous benefits to those who are eligible and can therefore change the amount spent on the program. Most mandatory spending is used on entitlement programs.  Other mandatory spending  Besides entitlement programs, mandatory spending also includes, for example, the salaries of federal judges, Members of Congress, and the President, as well as certain payments from the Forest Service to states. History Mandatory Spending as a Percent of the Federal Budget Prior to the Great Depression, nearly all federal expenditures were discretionary. Mandatory spending grew following the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935. An increasing percentage of the federal budget became devoted to mandatory spending. In 1947, Social Security accounted for just under five percent of the federal budget and less than one-half of one percent of GDP. By 1962, 13 percent of the federal budget and half of all mandatory spending was committed to Social Security. Less than 30 percent of all federal spending was mandatory. This percentage continued to increase when Congress amended the Social Security Act to create Medicare in 1965. Medicare is a government administered health insurance program for senior citizens. In the 10 years following the creation of Medicare, mandatory spending increased from 30 percent to over 50 percent of the federal budget. The graph to the right shows the larger share of the Federal Budget that mandatory spending has taken up over time. Though the rate of increase has since slowed, mandatory spending composed about 60 percent of the federal budget since FY 2012. Social Security Social Security spending has grown relative to the economy. In 1962, before the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security spending accounted for 13 percent of the total mandatory spending. This was about half of all mandatory spending. In FY 2016, Social Security accounted for 38 percent of mandatory spending. This accounts for about a little more than one third of all mandatory spending and around 4.3 to 4.8 percent of GDP in the US. Social Security has fluctuated around this level since the 1980s. Medicare and Medicaid have taken up an increasingly larger share of mandatory spending. Medicare and Medicaid Persistent increases in health care spending have been the main drivers in increases in mandatory spending. Mandatory spending has grown from 4.9 percent of federal spending in FY 1970, to 25.7 percent of federal spending in FY 2016. Health care cost per capita has grown much faster than the economy. New medical technologies have transformed health care and led to increasing costs. Third-party reimbursement of health care costs by public and private insurance programs provided few incentives to control costs until the 1980s. The introduction of Medicare's prospective payment system for hospitals in 1983 and the increasing share of Health Maintenance Organizations in the mid-1980s helped to slow down health care costs. Other attempts such as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have only been temporarily or partially successful in slowing down the rate of increased health care spending. In 2010,the passage of the Affordable Care Act established a mandate for most US residents to obtain health insurance, set up insurance exchanges, and expand Medicaid. Mandatory federal outlays for health programs increased as a result. Recessions Mandatory spending plays a large role in larger fiscal trends. During economic downturns, government revenues fall and expenditures rise as more people become eligible for mandatory programs such as Unemployment Insurance and Income Security programs. This causes deficits to increase or surpluses to shrink. Mandatory programs act as automatic stabilizers and provide a fiscal stimulus in the short run without the need for new legislative action. During the recession in 2008 and 2009, mandatory spending increased by 31% due to federal financial interventions and the economic downturn. Much of the money went to the Troubled Asset Relief Program and aid to Government Sponsored Enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Increased spending on Unemployment Insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program also contributed to the spike in spending. Prior to the recession, mandatory spending on Supplemental Security Income accounted for around 1.5 percent of GDP, however following the recession it accounted for around 3 percent of GDP. Many entitlement programs act as automatic stabilizers and as a result during economic downturns, the money needed to fund these programs increases significantly. Present In FY 2016, mandatory spending accounted for 64 percent of all federal spending. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were the largest individual mandatory expenditures, together accounting for about 78 percent of all mandatory spending. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid make up nearly 50 percent of all federal spending. Various income security programs, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Unemployment Insurance, Earned income tax credit and Child tax credit, account for an additional 18 percent of mandatory spending. Mandatory spending levels have and will continue to be affected by the automatic spending reduction process enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). The BCA imposes small reductions to mandatory spending seeking to cut spending by less than $.2 trillion from FY2012 to FY2021. Mandatory spending was reduced by $18 billion in FY2015. Many programs are exempt from sequestration such as Social Security, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 extended the mandatory spending sequester by two years through FY 2024. Increases in mandatory spending related to rising health care costs are projected to result in a continued upward trend despite these reductions. Some budget and social policy experts are worried that cuts in entitlement spending may compromise their goals: the economic security of the elderly and the poor. Future According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), annual mandatory spending will increase from $2.4 trillion in 2016 to $4.3 trillion by 2027. Though averaging about 10 percent of GDP since 1973, mandatory spending is projected to increase to about 14 percent of GDP by 2027. Discretionary spending on the other hand is projected to fall further, to 5 percent of GDP. BY FY2022, discretionary spending's share of the economy is projected to be equal to or less than spending on Social Security and Major Health Programs. Under the long term, projections suggest that if current policies remain unchanged, the US could face a major fiscal imbalance. Growth in spending, particularly for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is projected to outstrip growth in revenues. This would result in larger deficits and higher debt. Mandatory spending on health care is projected to expand from 5 percent of GDP in FY2016 to 14 percent in FY2089. Social Security, is projected to expand from 5 percent of GDP in FY 2016 to 7 percent of GDP by FY2089. It is projected that if spending continues to increase, the deficit will reach 5.2 percent of GDP by 2027. Mandatory spending under the BCA is projected to continue to grow in nominal terms and relative to GDP over the next 10 years. This growth is primarily due to elderly entitlement spending, such as Medicare and Social Security, that is projected to grow more quickly than GDP over the next ten years. The BCA has a minimal effect on this trend as it reduces mandatory spending under the automatic spending process by less than one tenth of 1 percent of GDP annually. The cuts to Medicare are not projected to prevent Medicare from growing in terms or relative to GDP over the 10-year budget window. The share of mandatory spending will continue to increase as a portion of federal spending and GDP. Entitlement programs The number of beneficiaries of entitlement programs has grown as the average age of the population has risen. The Medicare Act of 1965 extended health benefits for most retirees and greatly expanded mandatory spending. As life expectancy has increased, the portion of the population over 85 has also increased, which has created a rise in Social Security and Medicare spending. CBO baseline projections show further increases in federal health care spending that will cause the total share of Medicare and Medicaid spending to rise. Federal spending on other health related programs is also projected to increase as larger portions of the Affordable Care Act take effect. By FY2025, based on CBO baseline projections, spending on Medicare, Medicaid and other major federal health care programs is projected to account for 31 percent of total federal spending. Other programs such as Social Security Insurance and the Earned Income Tax Credit introduced in the 1970s, also increased the number of beneficiaries and thus mandatory spending.

It is an uncertainty modeling schedule technique. Event chain methodology is an extension of quantitative project risk analysis with Monte Carlo simulations. It is the next advance beyond critical path method and critical chain project management. Event chain methodology tries to mitigate the effect of motivational and cognitive biases in estimating and scheduling.Robyn M. Dawes and Bernard Corrigan, ‚Äò‚ÄòLinear Models in Decision Making‚Äô‚Äô Psychological Bulletin 81, no. 2 (1974): 93‚Äì106. It improves accuracy of risk assessment and helps to generate more realistic risk adjusted project schedules.Virine, Lev (2013). Integrated Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis of Project Portfolios. In Proceedings of Enterprise Risk Management Symposium. April 22‚Äì23, 2013, Chicago, IL History Event chain methodology is an extension of traditional Monte Carlo simulation of project schedules where uncertainties in task duration and costs are defined by statistical distribution. For example, task duration can be defined by three point estimates: low, base, and high. The results of analysis is a risk adjusted project schedule, crucial tasks, and probabilities that project will be completed on time and on budget. Defining uncertainties using statistical distribution provide accurate results if there is a reliable historical data about duration and cost of similar tasks in previous projects. Another approach is to define uncertainties using risk events or risk drivers, which can be assigned to different tasks or resources. Information about probabilities and impact of such events is easier to elicit, which improves accuracy of analysis. Risks can be recorded in the Risk register. Event chain methodology was first proposed in the period of 2002-2004. Virine, Lev (2013). Integrated Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis of Project Portfolios. In Proceedings of 2013 Enterprise Risk Management Symposium, April 22‚Äì24, Chicago, IL It is fully or partially implemented in a number of software application. Virine, Lev. and Trumper, Michael. (2015). Predicting the unpredictable: how to analyze project risks using event chain methodology. PM Network, 29(9), 28‚Äì29 Event Chain Methodology is based on six principles and has a number of outcomes. Principles=Moment of risk and state of activity Event chain diagram for one activityActivities (tasks) are not a continuous uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which transform an activity from one state to another. One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using statistical distribution. The original state is called a ground state, other states are called excited states. For example, if the team completes their job on activity, they can move to other activities. The notion of an activity's state is important because certain events can or cannot occur when activity is in certain state. It means that the state of an activity is subscribed to the events. Events can be local, affecting particular tasks or resources, or global affecting all tasks or resources. Event chains Events can be related to other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. For example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually, this can lead to the failure of the project. It could be different relationship between events. One event can trigger one or multiple events. Events can be correlated with each other without one triggering another one. In this case if one risk has occurred, another one will occur and vice versa. One event assigned in one activity can execute another activity or group of activities. In many cases it the execution of risk response plans. For example, event ‚Äústructural defect is discovered‚Äù can cause one or many activities ‚ÄúRepair‚Äù. Events can cause other events to occur either immediately or with a delay. The delay is a property of the event subscription. The delay can be deterministic, but in most cases, it is probabilistic. Also risks can be transferred from one activity to another. To define event chains, we need to identify a \\"sender\\", the event that initiates the chain of events. The sender event can cause one or more events that effect multiple activities. These are called \\"receiver\\" events. In turn, the receiver events can also act as sender events. Event chain diagrams Example of event chain diagram: local and global threats and opportunities with different probabilities and impacts Event chain diagram is a visualization that shows the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other.Virine, Lev & McVean, Jason. (2004). Visual Modeling of Business Problems: Workflow and Patterns, In Proceedings of 2004 Winter Simulation Conference, Washington DC. Virine, Lev & Rapley, Lisa. (2003). Visualization of Probabilistic Business Models, In Proceedings of 2003 Winter Simulation Conference, New Orleans, LA. The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Here are a few important rules: *Event chains diagrams present events as arrows on the Gantt charts. *Arrows pointing down are threats. Arrows pointing up are opportunities. *Issues are shown as an arrow within a circle. Color of the issue arrow is red (dark). *Closed or transferred risks are shown using dashed lines. Color of arrow is white. Closed issue is shown in the circle with dashed border line. *Excited states are represented by elevating the associated section of the bar on the Gantt chart. *Colors represent the calculated impact of the risk. Higher impacts are red or darker shade. Low impacts are green or lighter shade. The size of the arrow represents probability. *Event chains are shown as lines connecting arrows depicting events. *Event chains may trigger another activity. In this case event chain line will be connected with the beginning of activity with optional arrow. *Event chains may trigger a group of activities. In this case this group of activities will be surrounded by the box or frame and event chain line will be connected to the corner of the box or first activity within a frame. By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified. Example of event chain diagram with critical event chain and activity triggered by event Another tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event. Monte Carlo simulation Once events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using Monte Carlo simulation can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events. Probabilities and impacts of risks assigned to activities are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule.Williams, T. \\"Why Monte Carlo simulations of project networks can mislead\\". Project Management Journal, Vol 35. Issue 3, (2004): 53-61 In most projects it is necessary to supplement the event based variance with uncertainties as distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters. In Event chain methodology, risk can not only affect schedule and cost, but also other parameters such as safety, security, performance, technology, quality, and other objectives. In other words, one event can belong to different categories.Agarwal, Ruchi. and Virine, Lev. (2017). Monte Carlo Project Risk Analysis. In Raydugin, Y. (ed) Handbook of Research on Leveraging Risk and Uncertainties for Effective Project Management. IGI Global; 1 edition The result of the analysis would show risk exposure for different categories as well as integrated project risk score for all categories. This integrated project risk score is calculated based on relative weights for each risk category. Critical event chains Monte Carlo simulation provides the capability, through sensitivity analysis, to identify single or chains of events. These chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event chains. These are called ‚Äúcritical events‚Äù or ‚Äúcritical chains of events‚Äù. By identifying critical events or critical chains of events, we can identify strategies to minimize their negative effects: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, or Accept. Event and event chain ranking is performed for all risk categories (schedule-related and non- schedule) as part of one process. Integrated risk probability, impact and score can be calculated using weights for each risk category. Project control with event and event chains Monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data. The main reason for performance tracking is forecasting an activity's duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity. Event chain methodology reduces the risk probability and impact automatically based on the percent of work completed. Advanced analysis can be performed using a Bayesian approach. It is possible to monitor the chance that a project will meet a specific deadline. This chance is constantly updated as a result of the Monte Carlo analysis. Critical events and event chains can be different at the various phases of the project Phenomena=Repeated activities Repeated ActivitySometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects; sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity. Event chain methodology simplifies modeling of these scenarios. The original project schedule does not need to be updated, all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated must be defined. Event chains and risk response Mitigation planIf an event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may require some risk response effort. Risk response plans execution are triggered by events, which occur if an activity is in an excited state. Risk response events may attempt to transform the activity from the excited state to the ground state. Response plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the response plan to an event or event chain. The same response plan can be used for one or more events. Resource allocation based on events One potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc. See also *List of project management software *List of project management topics *Monte Carlo simulation *Program Evaluation and Review Technique *Project *Project management *Project planning *Work breakdown structure  References  Further reading  * Arnaud Doucet, Nando de Freitas and Neil Gordon, Sequential Monte Carlo methods in practice, 2001, . * Hammond, J.S. and Keeney, R.L. and Raiffa, H., Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions (1999).

Reid (born August 3, 1946) is an American former college basketball coach who most recently guided the Southern Utah University (SUU) men's basketball team. He was head coach at Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1989 to 1996, assistant coach for the NBA's Phoenix Suns, and played for former NBA coach Dick Motta at Weber State University. He has also coached at the high school, junior college and international levels. High school and college Reid attended Springville High School in Springville, Utah and was an all- state performer in both baseball and basketball. He went on to play both sports at the College of Eastern Utah and was recognized as a junior college All-American in baseball. Reid concluded his collegiate playing days at Weber State earning all conference honors in baseball both seasons he played and was also a key player for coach Dick Motta's Big Sky Conference championship team in basketball. Minor League Baseball After finishing college, Reid was drafted and played professionally, as a shortstop, for both the Atlanta Braves and Chicago White Sox minor league farm systems over four seasons (eventually playing at the AAA level). Coaching career=High school In 1971, Reid embarked on his basketball coaching career at Payson High School in Utah. He compiled a 50-26 in three seasons before moving on to Clearfield High School in 1974. He finished coaching at the northern Utah high school with a 60-24 record. BYU Reid became a member of Frank Arnold's staff at BYU in 1978 and stayed on as an assistant under LaDell Andersen when he replaced Arnold. He was named as BYU head coach in 1989. His BYU teams were consistent winners and Reid led them to a 152-77 (.667) record. BYU also made five NCAA Tournament appearances, won three conference regular season titles and two conference tournament championships during his tenure. His success did not prevent him from being disliked by some BYU fans and players. Reid's sons, Randy and Robbie (both heavily recruited by other schools), decided to play for their father at BYU. Some disgruntled alumni were not pleased that the Reids were playing for the Cougars, and some insinuated that Reid's decision to play his sons amounted to nepotism. By 1996, Reid's coaching future at BYU was in doubt. Some school administrators strongly suggested that getting Chris Burgess--a highly touted player from Irvine, California--to play for the Cougars, could save Reid's job. Burgess was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and his father had played for BYU, which is owned by the Church. In the end, Burgess told Reid that he was going to play for Duke. Upon hearing this, Reid allegedly told him that he had let down all members of the LDS church. Reid was dismissed as BYU head coach on December 17, 1996, shortly after the recruiting incident. Reid has stated since then that his remarks to Burgess were taken out of context. BYU had started the season 1-7 after being decimated by injuries; assistant Tony Ingle replaced Reid for the rest of what would become a 1-25 season‚Äîthe worst in school history. Reid's comments to Burgess have frequently been cited by the media and many associated with BYU as the primary reason for Reid's dismissal. While they were a factor in the decision, athletic director Rondo Fehlberg primarily cited concerns about sluggish attendance; despite recent conference success, his team was struggling to draw half-capacity crowds for even the most significant home games in the 22,700-seat Marriott Center. Other factors included the ol charges of nepotism, as well as the slow start to the 1996-97 season. https://web.archive.org/web/19970526043026/http://lubbockonline.com/news/122196/firedbyu.htm Reid's son Robbie did not return to BYU after serving a two-year LDS church mission to Greece. He attended the University of Michigan instead and became a two-year starter for the Wolverines to close out his college basketball career. Phoenix Suns Reid was hired by former BYU and NBA player Danny Ainge to be an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns. During his five years with the Suns they made two playoff appearances. Hangzhou Horses Reid coached the Hangzhou Horses in China's top professional league for two years. Snow College On May 9, 2005, Reid was hired as the head basketball coach for the Snow College Badgers. His teams at Snow compiled an overall record of 33-28 in two seasons including a 23-8 mark for the 2006-2007 season. Southern Utah On March 14, 2007, SUU President Michael Benson announced the hiring of Roger Reid to replace Coach Bill Evans. Reid coached for five seasons, then retired from coaching on March 8, 2012. Reid finished his run at Southern Utah with a 54-97 record.

Life Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison was born in Hauxwell, Yorkshire, the eleventh of the twelve children of Rev Mark James Pattison and his wife, Jane. One of her siblings was the scholar Mark Pattison. Her childhood was overshadowed by the illness of her father, who had suffered a mental breakdown and became violent and domineering. In 1856, she became secretly engaged to a man called James Tate, the son of the headmaster of Richmond school. The Tates were one of the few families with whom the Pattisons had social contact. At the same time she also developed feelings for another man, Purchas Stirke. After her mother's death in 1860, she broke off her engagement with James. She thought she preferred Stirke, but broke away from him as well. She was able to leave home with a ¬£90 bequest from her mother. From 1861‚Äì64, she ran the village school at Little Woolstone, Buckinghamshire. In the autumn of 1864, she joined the 'Christ Church sisterhood' (known as 'Good Samaritans') at Coatham, Middlesbrough which became the Community of the Holy Rood. In 1866, as novice Sister Dora, she was sent to Walsall Cottage Hospital to work as a relief nurse and would devote the remainder of her life to nursing. She was sent to work at Walsall's hospital in Bridge Street and arrived in Walsall on 8 January 1865. The rest of her life was spent in Walsall. She worked at the Cottage Hospital at The Mount until 1875, when Walsall was hit by smallpox. She worked for six months at an epidemic infirmary set up in Deadman's Lane (now Hospital Street), treating thousands of patients. During the last two years of her life, she worked at the hospital in Bridgeman Street, overlooking the South Staffordshire Railway (later the London and North Western Railway). She developed a special bond of friendship with railway workers who often suffered in industrial accidents. The railwaymen gave her a pony and a carriage and even raised the sum of ¬£50 from their own wages to enable her to visit housebound patients more easily.Sister Dora's biography , cms.walsall.gov.uk; accessed 11 February 2015. Death In 1877 Sister Dora developed breast cancer. She decided against an operation and kept her disease a secret. She died on Christmas Eve 1878, aged 46. At her funeral on 28 December, the town of Walsall turned out to see her off to Queen Street Cemetery, borne by eighteen railwaymen, engine drivers, porters and guards, all in working uniform. Legacy Two press clippings, noting the funeral and memorial arrangements for Sister Dora * The former Walsall General Hospital was renamed Walsall General (Sister Dora) Hospital. It has now been largely demolished in the rearrangement of the town's provision of health services, but Sister Dora's name is still perpetuated in the new hospitals. The provision for outpatients at Walsall Manor Hospital is named Sister Dora Outpatients Department. In Alumwell Close, Walsall, behind the Manor Hospital is a Mental Health Hospital which has been dedicated to Sister Dora. 'Dorothy Pattison Hospital' cares for Mental Health patients and belongs to the Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership Trust. * In 1882, a stained glass window at St. Matthew's Church, Walsall, was dedicated to her. * In October 1886, a statue of Sister Dora by Francis John Williamson was unveiled in Walsall by a Mr. B Beebee. It is the UK's first public statue of a woman not of royal blood. * An annual church service is held in her memory in at St. Paul's Church at the Crossing in Walsall. * Probably after employees' persuasion, the London & North Western Railway named one of its locomotives 'Sister Dora' (date?). 2-4-0 'Jumbo' number 2158 was chosen to carry the name and it was alleged to have been put on diagrams which took it through Walsall station every day. A working miniature version of this locomotive (to run on seven and a quarter inch gauge track) ran for a short time in the 1980s on the Walsall Steam Railway in Walsall Arboretum. The Walsall Steam Railway also regularly hauled passenger trains with a miniature LMS Black 5 4-6-0 number 5000 and this carried the name 'Sister Dora', too (though the prototype 5000 never did). * A portrait of Sister Dora by George Phoenix has been preserved at Wolverhampton Art Gallery. * British Rail Class 31 diesel locomotive 31 430 (now in preservation) was named after her. Several models of this locomotive have been produced in both 00 and N scales.

Located right outside the city's downtown district, Fountain Square is home to three designated national historic districts, the Laurel and Prospect, the State and Prospect, and the Virginia Avenue districts, Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs all of which were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The neighborhood derives its name from the successive fountains that have been prominently featured at the intersection of Virginia Avenue, East Prospect Street, and Shelby Street. Fountain Square is the first commercial historic district in Indiana, and it is the only portion of the city outside the initial mile square that has continually operated as a recognized commercial area, dating back to the 1870s. Its significance is not only as an early commercial district, but also as one that was developed and dominated by German-American immigrants, merchants, and entrepreneurs, who established a strong German character on the city's southside. From the 1920s to the 1950s, Fountain Square was the city's main entertainment district, with as many as seven theaters in operation at one point in time. After the construction of the interstate through Indianapolis, a portion of Fountain Square was demolished, with the remaining neighborhood disconnected from the surrounding areas. After decades of a declining population, the neighborhood is currently estimated to have 9,839 inhabitants. Historic preservation efforts began in the late 1990s, and the neighborhood slowly emerged as a vibrant commercial center once again. Today, Fountain Square is widely considered to be Indianapolis's newest trendy neighborhood, with an eclectic mix of retro architecture and modern, urban design. Geography Although Fountain Square is not officially delineated, the Fountain Square Neighborhood Association's service area is bounded to the north by the railroad tracks north of Deloss Street, to the east by State Street, to the south by Pleasant Run Parkway, and to the west by I-65. It is located southeast of downtown Indianapolis, and covers an area of approximately . Little remains of the original geographic features of the land. Fountain Square bases a portion its street pattern due to a continuation of the diagonal Virginia Avenue, which came about from the 1821 Ralston Plan for the new city of Indianapolis. The neighborhood is bordered upon by Bates‚ÄìHendricks to the southwest, Fletcher Place to the northwest, and Holy Cross neighborhood to the north. Within its boundaries, it houses the Laurel and Prospect, State and Prospect, and the Virginia Avenue historic districts. History=Early settlement Prior to the arrival of Fountain Square's modern-day inhabitants, the area was inhabited by the Delaware people, who settled there after they were pushed out of their homeland along the Delaware River watershed. After the Treaty of St. Mary's was signed on October 3, 1818, the Delaware ceded their lands in Indiana, which included a camp site at Pleasant Run, near Fountain Square's modern-day southern boundary. By 1820, the Delaware people were gone. alt= In 1835, Calvin Fletcher, a prominent banker, farmer and Indiana state senator, purchased a farm with Nicholas McCarty, with the intent to \\"sell the small parcels for a 'handsome advance'\\". While the early settlement was sparsely populated and primarily residential, the areas surrounding modern-day Fountain Square saw an influx of immigrants, particularly the Irish, who settled near the railroad tracks on South Street. Eventually, this area became known as \\"Irish Hill\\". During the 1860s, the Virginia Avenue corridor began to emerge as the southside's commercial district. During the Civil War, the 28th Colored Infantry Regiment, which was the only black regiment formed in Indiana, trained at a wooded area at Indianapolis's Camp Fremont, on land owned by Calvin Fletcher. It included 518 enlisted men who signed on for three years of service. In 1864, the Citizen's Street Railway Company extended their mule- drawn streetcar down to the intersection of Virginia Avenue with Shelby and Prospect Streets, since the construction of the city's Union Station and its multiple railroad lines had cut the area off from the downtown district. With the location of the streetcar turnaround, local residents nicknamed the neighborhood as \\"The End\\". The years following Fletcher's death saw rapid commercial growth for the neighborhood, beginning in the 1870s. This development is attributed to the large number of German immigrants settling in the area, which helped to develop Fountain Square's distinctly German character. By 1870, Virginia Avenue was a bustling part of Indianapolis. Due to the rapid growth in population, the area was platted eight times from 1870 to 1873. By 1880, single-family houses made up most of the lots off Virginia Avenue, although they were to be replaced by larger, commercial buildings in the following years. In 1889, the first fountain was constructed, giving Fountain Square its name. It was placed because a group of businessmen thought that \\"if they built a fountain, then maybe the farmers would stop and do business while they watered their animals.\\" Continued growth alt= Near the turn of the 20th century, Fountain Square saw an influx of many Eastern and Southern European immigrants moving into the neighborhood. Fountain Square enjoyed continued growth as the southside's primary commercial district. The opening of the Fountain Square State Bank (1909), the Fountain Square Post Office (1927), Havercamp and Dirk's Grocery (1905), Koehring & Son Warehouse (1900), the Fountain Square branch of the Standard Grocery Company (1927), the Frank E. Reeser Company (1904), Wiese-Wenzel Pharmacy (1905), the Sommer- Roempke Bakery (1909), the Fountain Square Hardware Company (1912), Horuff & Son Shoe Store (1911), Jessie Hartman Milliners (1908), the William H. and Fiora Young Redman Wallpaper and Interior Design business (1923), the Charles F. Iske Furniture Store (1910), The Fountain Block Commercial Building (1902), and the G. C. Murphy Company (1929), are examples of this phenomenon. In the early 1900s, Fountain Square's May Day celebration brought huge crowds into the neighborhood from all over the city to watch the parade and witness the festivities in nearby Garfield Park. Following years of growth and expansion, the neighborhood's population reached an estimated 26,285 by 1930. During World War II, Fountain Square experienced an influx of Appalachian settlers coming in from Kentucky and Tennessee, who had moved to the city by the lure of the war industries that were operating in Indianapolis. At that time, the majority of the population belonged to the white working-class, without a college education. By 1950, Fountain Square's population had peaked to an estimated at 27,242. At this time, Fountain Square was considered \\"downtown\\" for the southside areas of the city, offering multiple entertainment venues, a wide range of retail, shopping, church, and social centers. Decline However, the next decade saw the beginning of Fountain Square's demise, as newer more modern developments further south took over Fountain Square's role as the southside's commercial district. The closing of all of the theaters exacerbated its economic and cultural demise. Symbolically, the fountain from which Fountain Square received its name was removed in 1954 due to traffic concerns, to be returned in 1969 during a wave of revitalization efforts. The State and Prospect District, among two others located within Fountain Square, was recognized as a historic district in 1983. During the 1960s, Indianapolis, along with the rest of the United States, experienced a great amount of societal upheaval, exacerbated by white flight after construction of the Interstate Highway System enabled many Americans to leave their industrial cities for new housing and shopping options in the suburbs. In particular, the construction of the I-65 and I-70 interchanges from 1968 to 1971 had a negative effect on Fountain Square's population totals, as many of the neighborhood's multi-level flats and apartments were cleared to make way for the highway. In all, over 17,000 residents were displaced from the downtown areas, 6,000 of which came from Fountain Square itself, totaling 25 percent of the neighborhood's population. In effect, this had cut Fountain Square's inhabitants off from downtown's social services and the adjacent neighborhoods, further exacerbating its population decline. By 1970, its population was an estimated 19,736, a decline of over 24 percent compared to the previous decade. At that time, the minority population had risen to 6 percent. For the next few decades, Fountain Square's population continued to decline, to 15,941 in 1980‚Äîa drop of almost 20 percent as compared to 1970 levels. Revitalization Between 1980 and 1982, more than $3 million was invested in Fountain Square. In 1983, three historic districts within Fountain Square were placed on the National Register of Historic Places, spurring a wave of corporate support, city grants, and private donations. In 1984, the neighborhood was placed on the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission's list of adopted districts to focus on area rehabilitation. By 1990, the population had dropped to 13,903, including a minority population of about 6.66 percent. A revitalized building on Prospect Street now houses a local Greek restaurant. In the 1990s, several neighborhood community organizations joined efforts to revitalize Fountain Square's former commercial center, resulting in the opening of several new restaurants, art galleries, retail and office places, and live entertainment venues. In 1993, local resident Linton Calvert, a local barber and former city bowling champion, helped spur the transformation of Fountain Square through his purchase and subsequent restoration of the mostly vacant Fountain Square Theatre building, which up until that point housed a furniture store. With his investment, the neighborhood benefited greatly, with reinvestment efforts that have continued up to this day. In 1999, Indianapolis recognized Fountain Square as one of the city's six cultural districts. The designation of Fountain Square as one of Indianapolis's cultural districts has contributed to the neighborhood's rebirth. Additional factors that have helped to cement the neighborhood's revitalization efforts are its compact and walkable streetscapes, unique building architecture, three historic district designations, its proximity to downtown, and ease of access from the interstates. Upgrades to the neighborhood's streetscape, building rehabilitation, the construction of additional public spaces, and the placement of directional signs that visually define Fountain Square have also contributed to this process. Demographics Because Fountain Square has not been delineated in past census counts, there are not any accurate population totals for the neighborhood. The neighborhood's population peaked at an estimated 27,242 in 1950; however, the population dropped dramatically since then, and current estimates have placed that number at around 9,839. Demographic data for the neighborhood reveals a 72 percent increase of average home values from $47,000 in 2000 to $81,000 in 2013. During that same time period, average rent prices have increased 82 percent, from $439 to $798. The number of residents with college education has also increased, although poverty rates also increased and average income has declined. Recently, Fountain Square has witnessed the effects of gentrification, as the average family income has increased 47 percent from 2010 to 2016.http://www.savi.org/feature_report/neighborhood-change-1970-2016/ Accordingly, the neighborhood's property values have increased, and the number of young professionals moving into the neighborhood has continued to climb. Transportation IndyGo's bus rapid transit Red Line stop under construction. Fountain Square played an important role in the history and development of the city's transportation. Historically, it was the last stop on Indianapolis's Virginia Avenue streetcar line. Today, Fountain Square is connected to IndyGo's bus rapid transit Red Line, which was opened in Summer 2019. Projected to carry 11,000 daily passengers, the Red Line is a north‚Äìsouth transit line that connects the neighborhood with downtown and the Broad Ripple commercial district. The neighborhood is also connected to downtown by the Indianapolis Cultural Trail, which is a multi-use trail that was inaugurated in 2013. An Indiana University Public Policy Institute report on the Cultural Trail estimated a $1 billion increase in property values along the route.

On 1 July 1999 85 (Ulster) Squadron moved to Bangor and was subtitled '(Ulster and Antrim Artillery)'. This was done in recognition of the loss of 74 (Antrim Artillery) Squadron Royal Engineers (Volunteers). The Squadron became custodian of the Antrim Artillery property as a result of this. With the re- raising of TA Royal Engineers in Bangor, in the form of 591 (Independent) Field Squadron Royal Engineers (Volunteers) the Squadron moved to Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn. Due to the reduction in Territorial Army Royal Signals units, as a result of the Strategic Review of Reserves, 40 (Ulster) Signal Regiment (Volunteers) disbanded on 31 March 2010.

Unlike many maritime patrol aircraft, which are typically conversions of civilian designs, the P-1 is a purpose-built maritime aircraft with no civil counterpart and was designed from the onset for the role. It has the distinction of being the first operational aircraft in the world to make use of a fly-by-optics control system. The P-1 has entered service with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) as a replacement for the P-3C Orion. On 26 March 2013, the JMSDF took delivery of the first two operational P-1 aircraft. Export customers are also being sought for the type as part of a general loosening of Japanese military export restrictions. Development Observing that its fleet of P-3C aircraft had been in service for some time, the JMSDF began searching for a replacement maritime patrol aircraft. Since other similar aircraft produced abroad did not meet the JMSDF's requirements, the development of a purpose-built indigenous aircraft became necessary. The Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) submitted the domestic development of a P-X maritime patrol aircraft as part of its April 2001 ‚Äì March 2006 Five-Year Defense Plan.\\"Sky-High Expectations for Japan's P-X and C-X Aircraft.\\" Kawasaki Heavy Industries Scope Quarterly Newsletter, No.73. October 2007. In 2001, following its earlier proposal, the Kawasaki Aerospace Company received prime contractor status for the P-X program, as well as the adjacent C-X program for a next generation cargo aircraft; this selection process occurred almost 30 years since the previous large-scale domestic development of an aircraft in Japan. The P-X shares some components with the C-X, later designated as the twin-engined Kawasaki C-2, another indigenously-developed aircraft to replace the Kawasaki C-1 and C-130H Hercules cargo aircraft. Although the P-X and C-X designs were originally independent, it was decided that having common components to both designs would be useful.\\"P-1&C-X; development reference paper.\\" TRDI Defense Technology Symposium, 2007. pp. 4‚Äì6. The JDA mandated that the two aircraft share identical body components; common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and gear control unit. Due to the different roles of the two aircraft, they remain distinctly separate. The sharing of development resources had allowed for a large reduction in overall development costs which, when including the C-2, were reported as being 345 billion Yen ($3 billion) in 2007.\\"‰∏≠Êó•Êñ∞ËÅû:ÔºúËúúÊúà„ÅÆÁµÇÁÑâÔºû „Éü„É©„Ç§„Ç∫„Å´Âõ∫Âü∑:Èò≤Ë°õÂà©Ê®© ËúúÊúà„ÅÆÊßãÂõ≥(CHUNICHI Web).\\" Chunichi Shimbun, 2008. In addition to a level of commonality with the C-2, one proposed derivative of the P-1 is a civilian airliner, the proposed project has typically been referred to as the Kawasaki YPX. If development is pursued, the YPX would make extensive use of technology and components of the P-1, such as the wingbox, empennage, and fuselage.\\"FARNBOROUGH 2008: Japan eyes slice of CSeries market.\\" Flight International, 15 July 2008.Govindasamy, Siva. \\"Kawasaki talks civil.\\" Flight International, 23 September 2008.

P-1 with its US equivalent, the Boeing P-8 Poseidon in 2014 In April 2004, Japan and US extended discussions on potential cooperative efforts on the P-X and US Navy's Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) programmes; options ranged from terminating the P-X program to participate in the US-led MMA program to incorporating some of the MMA's technology onto the P-X to reduce costs.\\"Japan extends talks with USA.\\" Flight International, 13 April 2004. The Japanese Defence Ministry ultimately opted to persist with the P-X program, stating that: \\"there was a possibility that foreign aircraft would not satisfy the required capability and there was a possibility that foreign aircraft would not meet the required period of introduction...it is necessary to domestically develop the aircraft\\". In addition to the P-1, studies were also conducted into the use of ship-based UAVs to support maritime aviation activities.Waldron, Greg. \\"Japan's defence budget places premium on airpower.\\" Flight International, 19 December 2013. Since 2014, Japan has been making approaches to other nations for prospective export sales of the P-1.\\"DUBAI: Kawasaki talks up its aerospace portfolio.\\" Flight International, 8 November 2015. New Zealand was the first country to which the P-1 had been offered in what had been referred to by a Japanese official as a \\"one on one fight with Boeing's P-8 patrol plane.\\" The P-1 was offered in conjunction with the C-2 to give New Zealand the advantage of commonality for their patrol and transport aircraft. On the 9th of July 2018 New Zealand selected the P-8 Poseidon. Japanese officials have claimed that the P-1 is a more capable, albeit more expensive, aircraft than the Boeing P-8 Poseidon; in comparison to the P-8, the P-1 has a greater range, a larger bomb bay, and has been purpose-built for the maritime patrol mission. Prior to 2015, the P-1 was being procured at a typical rate of one or two aircraft deliveries per year; in 2015, this changed to a bulk order for 20 P-1s as part of a measure to cut the aircraft's unit costs.Waldron, Greg. \\"Japan defence budget calls for 20 P-1s, 5 V-22s.\\" Flight International, 14 January 2015.

The four-engine low-wing loading design adopted for the P-1 results in a flight profile with better maneuverability and stability at low-speed, low-altitude flight and allows the aircraft to continue its mission in the event of a single engine failure as well as greater operational survivability, the high-bypass engines provide for quiet, fuel-efficient operation. The P-1 has reduced transit times in comparison to turboprop-powered competitors, and the turbofans are quieter, making it more difficult for submerged submarines to detect it acoustically. The P-1 is equipped with many newly developed technologies and features, particularly in terms of its avionics and missions systems. One such key feature is the use of a fly-by-optics flight control system, which essentially replaces standard metal wiring with optical fiber cables. This has the effect of decreasing electro-magnetic disturbances to the sensors in comparison to more common fly- by-wire control systems. The P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system.\\"Tim Huxley: Japan's P-1 leads defence export drive.\\" IISS Defence and Military Analysis Programme, 11 September 2015.

Define perpendicular axes x, y, and z (which meet at origin O) so that the body lies in the xy plane, and the z axis is perpendicular to the plane of the body. Let Ix, Iy and Iz be moments of inertia about axis x, y, z respectively, the perpendicular axis theorem states that :I_z = I_x + I_y This rule can be applied with the parallel axis theorem and the stretch rule to find polar moments of inertia for a variety of shapes. If a planar object (or prism, by the stretch rule) has rotational symmetry such that I_x and I_y are equal , then the perpendicular axes theorem provides the useful relationship: :I_z = 2I_x = 2I_y  Derivation  Working in Cartesian co-ordinates, the moment of inertia of the planar body about the z axis is given by: :I_{z} = \\\\int \\\\left(x^2 + y^2\\\\right)\\\\, dm = \\\\int x^2\\\\,dm + \\\\int y^2\\\\,dm = I_{y} + I_{x} On the plane, z=0, so these two terms are the moments of inertia about the x and y axes respectively, giving the perpendicular axis theorem.

Portaflex referred to the amps‚Äô portable reflex baffle system. The innovative ‚Äòflip-top‚Äô amplifier head design helped dissipate heat and reduce chassis and tube vibration during use, and inverted to store inside the cabinet for portability. The speaker cabinets were carefully tuned with ports and baffling. The introduction of the Portaflex series established a new standard for bass amplification and completely replaced Ampeg‚Äôs previous amplifier lineup. The Portaflex line has many different configurations. B-15 The first amp in Ampeg‚Äôs Portaflex series was the B-15, a 2-channel tube amplifier with per-channel volume controls and shared Baxandall-type tone control, housed within a ‚Äôflip-top‚Äô tuned-port cabinet design mounted to a dolly. Shortly after the B-15‚Äôs introduction in 1960, it became the most popular bass amp in the world. Thanks to the Manhattan Bass Club, there were B-15s in every professional recording studio in New York, and the B-15 was embraced by the most prolific session bass players of the time, such as James Jamerson and Bob Babbitt at Motown in Detroit,Justman, Paul. Standing in the Shadows of Motown. Donald ‚ÄúDuck‚Äù Dunn at Stax Records in Memphis, and Chuck Rainey in New York and Los Angeles. In subsequent decades, popularity of the B-15 endured, used by bassists like Darryl Jones, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, and Owen Biddle. SB-12 Ampeg manufactured the Portaflex SB-12 model amplifier from 1965-1971. This lightweight (67 pound) cabinet incorporated the flip-top design of other larger Portaflex amplifiers of the time. Although the SB-12 isn't as well known as the more powerful B-15, it is still highly sought after by musicians who use it mainly for studio recording. The 'SB' in SB-12 stood for string bass; the '12' indicates the diameter of the speaker in inches. It contained a single-channel, 25-watt tube amplifier and a single Jensen speaker. Unlike bulk of the Portaflex line of bass amplifiers, the SB-12 was designed as a universal amplifier. It incorporated two separate inputs, one labeled \\"Bass\\" and the other \\"Instruments\\".

The northern edge of Thenon is set on a prominent ridge. Its recent history is strongly linked to the road network. The D6089 road passes through Thenon and continues west to Bordeaux on the coast. For many years, Thenon was blighted by this road, which was a main haulage and tourist route and very frequently congested. Heavy road traffic nonetheless brought stopovers and tourists, retail trade, demand for accommodation, and restaurants. But in the mid-2000s the east-west A89/E70 toll road (la Transeurop√©enne) was opened, passing north of Thenon and funnelling the major traffic flow away from the town. Thenon was not given an exit (sortie) close by, and thus it is now bypassed. Its small rail station is several kilometers from the town centre in countryside to the north, and is not heavily patronised.  History  Prehistory and history is described for the Aquitaine region, which has some of the most important prehistoric cave dwellings in Europe. The region was a strong centre of resistance against Germany in World War II. The nearby village of Rouffignac-Saint-Cernin-de- Reilhac was almost entirely destroyed as an act of retribution, after two German soldiers were captured by French partisans.  Economy  The high street of Thenon (Av. de la 4eme R√©publique) passes north-south and is the scene of a weekly market and some shops. To the southern end is the cultural heart, the Place Pasteur with a church, older buildings (some medieval), marketplace (shown here) and a small ch√¢teau dating from the 12th century (captured briefly by the English in 1439, retaken by Charles II's troops). Only part of the castle remains. Over the last 25 years the main street has hosted at least three supermarkets, a grocer, butcher, bars, hardware store, 2 boulangeries, a bank, and 2 chemists. However, with the reduction in traffic on the D6089, the High Street has 'died' and most or its retail outlets have closed except the boulangeries and chemist. The Mairie has offered subsidised rent to businesses willing to re-occupy the vacant stores, with some success as of 2015 when the bar/cafe was again reopened as a cooperative. A medium- sized supermarket on the now-quiet D6089 west of town has become the main retail store, with the bar and bank opposite in modern premises, and local residents feel much has been lost by these closures and relocations. In addition, some commercial activity in Thenon has been lost because the 1990s/2000s boom in French second-homes, from which this region benefited through high property prices and more consumers and tax income, has now subsided. There is a primary school and middle school, the Coll√®ge Suzanne Lacore. The nearest high school is in Terrasson, 16.5 km away. The region has a strong farming heritage, but little industrial activity or service occupations (there is a large paper mill east at Le Lardin). With poor soils, walnut trees, figs and sheep are common, with few vineyards and cereals. Tertiary sector jobs are largely found in P√©rigueux 35 km away, or in the slightly larger towns like Montignac on the V√©z√®re River, 14 km to the south east (the nearest town to the Lascaux caves). The beautiful countryside around the town is steep and rolling, with farms interspersed with woodlands, in which the local population continues to hunt enthusiastically for rabbits, wild boar and deer. Tourism still peaks in the summer months when the weekly market is a little more animated and the etang (lake) below the town hosts swimming and a cafe. The estate agent advertises in both French and English, and there are a few English and Dutch summer homes and year round residents, mainly located outside the town in the surrounding villages. Property prices have not increased in recent years. Overseas migrants are attracted by the cheaper property prices compared to the V√©z√®re and Dordogne villages to the south.

Also called the Persian leopard or Asia Minor leopard, it was proposed in the 19th century as a distinct leopard subspecies native to southwestern Turkey. In this part of Turkey, the leopard population is considered locally extinct since the mid-1970s. In southeastern Turkey, it was sighted in Bitlis Province in 2008. The first camera trap photograph of a leopard in Turkey was obtained in September 2013 in Trabzon Province in the country's eastern part.World Bulletin (2013). \\"Panthera pardus\\" spotted in Turkey. World Bulletin, 11 September 2013. In November 2013, a leopard was killed in the √áƒ±nar district of Diyarbakƒ±r Province.H√ºrriyet Daily News (2013). Shepherd kills first Anatolian leopard sighted in Turkey for years H√ºrriyet Daily News, 3 November 2013. This specimen was considered the westernmost observation of the subspecies.  Taxonomy  Felis tulliana was the scientific name used by Achille Valenciennes in 1856 who described a leopard from the area of Smyrna in western Turkey. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Anatolian leopard was considered a distinct leopard subspecies occurring only in western Turkey. In 2017, P. p. ciscaucasia was subsumed to P. p. tulliana.  Characteristics  In 1856, the Anatolian leopard was described as having a grayish, slightly reddish fur with large rosettes on the flanks and back, smaller ones on the shoulder and upper legs, and spots on the head and neck. It is similar in size to the African leopard.  Distribution and habitat Aegean Region in Turkey marked in red The Anatolian leopard was thought to have ranged in the Aegean and western parts of Turkey. It was not recorded in the Black Sea region. Stone traps for leopards and Caspian tigers dating to the Roman Empire still exist in the Taurus Mountains. Since surveys were not carried out in western Turkey until the mid-1980s, biologists doubted whether leopards still survived in this part of Anatolia. Sighting reports from the environs of Alanya in the south of the Lycian peninsula suggested that a scattered population existed between Finike, Antalya and Alanya in the early 1990s. Fresh faecal pellets found in Termessos National Park in 1992 were attributed to an Anatolian leopard. A decade later, no signs of the presence of leopards were detected in Termessos National Park. Interviews conducted with local people and national park personnel did not corroborate the presence of leopards in this area. During surveys carried out between 1993 and 2002, zoologists found evidence of leopards in the upper forest and alpine zones of the Pontic Mountains in northern Anatolia. In this area, possible prey species include wild ungulates such as deer, chamois, wild goat, wild boar but also European hare and Caucasian grouse. It is unknown whether a significant number of leopards still exist in Anatolia. Extensive trophy hunting is thought to be the prime factor for the decline and possible extinction of the Anatolian leopard. One hunter named Mantolu Hasan killed at least fifteen leopards between 1930 and 1950.Ert√ºz√ºn, M. (2006). The last Anatolian Panther. In eastern Turkey, the range of the Anatolian leopard converges with the range of the Persian leopard. A male leopard camera trapped in the Georgian Vashlovani National Park in 2003 was considered a Caucasian leopard. Leopards recorded in Galilee, Golan Heights and in the Judaean Desert are considered Arabian leopards. The last leopard in Syria is reputed to have been killed in 1963 in the Alauwit Mountains.  Sightings and encounters  In 1974 a leopard was killed in Baƒü√∂z√º village near Beypazarƒ± following an attack on a woman. For three decades, this encounter was considered to have been the last confirmed sighting of an Anatolian leopard. In 2010, a leopard was killed and skinned in the Siirt Province. In September 2013, an animal captured by camera traps in the Trabzon Province in Turkey's northern region was identified as a leopard by biologists from the Karadeniz Technical University who asserted to have obtained several photos of leopards in the surveyed area. On 3 November 2013, a leopard was killed after it attacked a shepherd in Diyarbakƒ±r Province in the country's southern region. In 2019, the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Nature Protection initiated a survey to document wildlife in the country by using camera traps and quadcopters.  The Kaplani of Samos Island in Greece  The Natural History Museum of the Aegean on Samos Island exhibits a stuffed leopard that was allegedly killed on the island in 1862 (after another one appeared in 1836). It carries a label with the name Kaplani, , indicating it is a leopard. Its size, shape and coat colour is rather unnatural for a leopard, but may have been altered in the process of preparing the skin. It is possible that an Anatolian leopard reached the island by swimming across a channel from the Turkish coast, which is about farther east.Masseti, M. (2010). Homeless mammals from the Ionian and Aegean islands. Bonn zoological Bulletin 57 (2): 367‚Äì373.

It has roots in American rock, which was imported to South Korea by U.S. soldiers fighting in the Korean War and stationing in U.S. military bases in South Korea after the war. Around the U.S. military bases, local musicians could have opportunities to learn American rock music and perform it onstage for U.S. soldiers. As a result, many Korean rock bands, called Vocal Bands or Group Sound, started their musical careers in the 1960s. Under the military administration in the 1970s, rock music and its subculture were classified as a depraved youth culture and restricted. After the Korean Fifth Republic, the censorship policies under military government were abolished and rock music became a mainstream genre in South Korea until the end of the 1980s. Today, rock music is not a main genre in the music market in South Korea, but it still occupies a big portion of music consumption in South Korea. History= 1950s  Rock music was brought to South Korea in 1950 by U.S. soldiers fighting in the Korean War. After the war ended in 1953, many U.S. soldiers remained in South Korea, stationed on military bases, where local musicians and singers performed. In 1957, South Korea's first rock guitarist, Shin Jung-hyeon, debuted on a U.S. military base. Shin Jung-hyeon, who came to be known as South Korea's \\"Godfather of rock,\\" later said that Korean rock was born on U.S. military bases. One girl group called The Kim Sisters debuted on the U.S. military base stage, practiced their talents and skills, and then started their musical career in the United States.  1960s  In 1962, Shin Jung- hyeon formed the first Korean rock band, Add4. Soon after, other Korean rock bands, referred to as \\"Group Sound\\" musicians, emerged, including HE6, K'okkiri Brothers, and Key Boys, who are best known for their hit song, \\"Let's Go to the Beach.\\" The group sound musicians of the mid-1960s were heavily influenced by American and British rock of the same era. However, instead of performing exclusively on U.S. military bases, they began to perform for South Korean audiences. The first generation of Korean rock musicians, including Shin Jung-hyeon, started to appear in the 1960s. However, South Korea was suffering under a totalitarian military dictatorship and the social atmosphere under the Park Chung-hee administration, which was still conservative and closed, hippie culture and rock music, which were representative of youth culture, were merely a target of suppression. In the 1960s, while western countries and Japan were overwhelmed by a new youth culture revolution with rock music, South Korea was far from the fad.  1970s  During the 1970s, music was heavily censored by the Park Chung-hee administration. Shin Jung- hyeon was imprisoned on drug charges. Han Dae-soo moved to New York in self- exile after two of his albums were banned by the government. The imprisonment of Shin Jung-hyeon slowed the production of Korean rock, but other artists, most notably Sanulrim emerged during the late 1970s, before dance music came to dominate Korean popular music in the 1980s. Nonetheless, since the 1970s, with the spread of the phonograph to middle-class families, the distribution of pirated foreign music, and the popularity of playing rock and pop music in music cafes, the number of rock music fans increased and the foundation of rock music culture began to grow. Although there were far more opportunities to listen to western original rock music, the government's censorship was still strict, preventing creative activities from being free.  1980s  In the 1980s, popular musical tastes moved away from rock music. The scene was dominated by heavy metal music, in particular Boohwal, Baekdoosan, and Sinawe, collectively known as the Big 3. The young generation of South Korea who grew up listening to rock music in the early '70s became college students or adults and became the main members of the rock called Group Sound, which led to a craze in the '80s. In 1980, the hard rock band Magma came out at the college song festival and shocked people. Hard rock and heavy metal were also gaining attention in Korea due to the appearance of Magma. Since then, Baekdusan, Boohwal and Sinawe, the bands that represent the 1980s, were also called the Korean Rock Band Trio in the 80s. The song festival also attracted attention from rock bands that would succeed Magma, T-sams in 1987 and Infinite Track in 1988. The 1980s was when rock music came closest to the mainstream of Korean pop music, with rock bands often being at the top of music ranking programs aired by public television and radio. In the 1980s, one of the reasons rock music became more popular than the past was that censorship was somewhat eased compared to the Park Chung-hee administration.  1990s - present  Rock music was revived in the early 1990s with democratization following the presidency of Roh Tae-woo. As information flowed more freely into the country, Korean youths were exposed to decades of popular foreign music in a short span of time, and some began to form bands. Two of the earliest bands were Crying Nut and No Brain, which introduced the country to a variety of new genres in a localized blend called \\"Chosun Punk,\\" spearheaded by indie label Drug Records which also managed Club Drug. With increased globalization and access to the Internet, the music scene diversified and incorporated more styles of music. The late 1990s saw increasing diversity in musical influences, as younger bands like Rux emerged and The Geeks introduced Korea to straight edge hardcore punk. Ska-punk was another strong early influence, producing bands including Lazybone and Beach Valley. In 2006, Skasucks formed and led the ska- punk movement in Korea. The second wave of Korean heavy metal began the 1990s. While metal bands like Crash (1989), Seed (1996), and Sad Legend (1996) were performing Thrash Metal and Death Metal in concert halls and smaller clubs such as Metallica in Shinrim-dong and Drug in Hongdae, there were other heavier genres that would appear in South Korea. Thanks to the internet, extreme metal subgenres like Black Metal and Grindcore influenced bands like Kalpa (1996), Oathean (1996), Dark Mirror ov Tragedy (2003), and Mangani (2013). While the sound of some groups was influenced by their foreign counterparts, other bands added Korean elements to their sound. Some of the examples of this would be Dokaebi (Hangul: ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ) a death metal band with Korean chanting, Gostwind, a progressive metal band using traditional Korean instruments, and Bamseomhaejeokdan (Hangul: Î∞§ÏÑ¨Ìï¥Ï†ÅÎã®) which mixes Grindcore with Korean topics. Underground shows normally occur in Seoul, in the Hongdae and Mullae-dong areas, Busan, and Daegu. There are some festivals, like the Busan Rock Festival (2000-present), and the Dongducheon Rock Festival (1999-present). In the 2000s Korean media outlets started producing television series covering rock music. Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) produced a four- part musical drama series in 2010 called Rock, Rock, Rock based on the life of Boowhal founder Kim Tae-won and covers his life from middle school until the year 2003. In 2013 ArirangTV produced a 13-part series called Rock on Korea hosted by Kim Do-kyun, guitarist of Baekdooson, that chronicles rock music on the South Korean peninsula from the 1960s to present day rock bands that are currently performing in Korean clubs. In 2018 United States expats Ian Henderson and Michael O'Dwyer produced the movie documentary K-Pop Killers. In the film, which took just over a year to film, the South Korean extreme metal scene is covered in detail. Current members of extreme metal bands and bands such as Baekdoosan and Mahatma are interviewed. Music venue owners like Lee Yuying of GBN Live House, Kirk Kwon of Thunderhorse Tavern and Jay Lee of 3Thumbs are also interviewed. ‚ÄúToday, most kinds of music promotion in South Korea happen online, with diminutive mainstream attention and downloadable albums.‚Äù Promoters use social networking platforms to inform fans of upcoming shows. At one point in the early 2000s fanzines were being made by expatriates and Koreans that discussed the rock subculture and reviewed local bands‚Äô music releases. Thanks to the help, and interest, of foreigners and newcomers to the music scene albums are being recorded, produced by members within the scene and then distributed by record labels founded underground band members. Some bands, like Dark Mirror ov Tragedy have signed contracts with foreign labels and are receiving support from the label.

The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. Scott's direction and visual style were praised by critics, but they criticized his formulaic handling of the story and use of conventions from the spy genre, such as surveillance shots from high-altitude spy planes. The film was released in the United States on October 10, 2008. Plot Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a CIA case officer in Iraq, tracking a terrorist called Al-Saleem (Alon Abutbul). He meets Nizar, a member of the terrorist organization who is prepared to offer information in return for asylum in North America. Despite the objections of his boss, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), Ferris agrees to shelter Nizar. Nizar is used as a pawn to draw out the rest of his cell; when Nizar is captured, Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent his exposing the identities of Ferris and his associate, Bassam (Oscar Isaac). However, furious at Hoffman's refusal to act on the information Nizar provided, Ferris and Bassam go to search the safe house in Balad, Iraq, Nizar had told them about. Ferris observes men burning records and attempts to bluff his way in but is exposed. In the ensuing shootout and chase, Ferris and Bassam's vehicle is hit by an RPG. Ferris and some salvaged discs are rescued by helicopter, but Bassam is killed in the explosion. Meanwhile, unknown terrorists in the UK plan to follow up on bus bombings in Sheffield with more attacks in Manchester, but they blow themselves up when the police arrive at their house. Having recovered from his injuries, Ferris is assigned to Jordan to continue searching for Al-Saleem. There, Ferris meets with and negotiates a collaboration with Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate. From the intelligence Ferris harvested from the Balad safe house, Hoffman locates an Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes (unbeknownst to Ferris) a \\"side operation\\" via a local agency. Ferris' CIA subordinate, Skip (Vince Colosimo), identifies the local agency asset as Ziyad Abishi. Abishi blows his cover with a terrorist from the safe house. The terrorist flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, and Ferris chases and kills him in such a place and manner that implies the death is a random robbery. Salaam (via \\"back channels\\") corroborates this interpretation of killing with those who remain at the safe house. Ferris lambastes Hoffman for running \\"side operations\\" which he feels are interfering with and undermining the operational integrity of the primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for dog bites he suffered while eliminating the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and begins developing romantic feelings for her. In Europe the bombers strike again at an Amsterdam flower market, killing 75 people and wounding hundreds more. Having recognized one of the men living in the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami (Kais Nashef), Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unbeknownst to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Skip to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris' associate, Skip, is caught by Salaam. Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, blames Ferris' duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house, and exiles Ferris from Jordan. Ferris returns to Hoffman in Washington, and they devise a new plan to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is motivated more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack and set up Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman), an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al-Saleem will come out of hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait. Salaam invites Ferris back to Jordan and shares his suspicions that Omar Sadiki is a terrorist, although Ferris feigns ignorance. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly killed in the subsequent car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack. He is later found beaten and killed. Ferris goes back to his apartment and discovers that Aisha has been kidnapped. He desperately asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris' having lied to him earlier. Ferris offers himself in exchange to Aisha's kidnappers and is brought to the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria, where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double- crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera, and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Salaam's security officer. Salaam visits Ferris in the hospital, and reveals he had faked Aisha's abduction and orchestrated Ferris' capture by Al-Saleem using Karami as a go-between. Having lost the will to fight in this particular \\"war\\", Ferris goes off the grid and goes to see Aisha again.

Themes Ridley Scott has made a previous film about the conflict between the Western and Arab civilizations, Kingdom of Heaven (2005), set during the Crusades. Body of Lies resumes this theme in the context of modern intelligence operations and terrorism. The film puts two contrasting characters on the same side. Ferris, the CIA man on the ground, is a dedicated Arabist fluent in the language; he relies on trust, local knowledge and HUMINT. Hoffman, his superior, who is detached at home in Washington, D.C., and at the CIA in Virginia, is more Machiavellian: he authorizes deceit, double-crossing, and violence by telephone and without scruple. The New Yorker interpreted him as \\"a greedy, American domestic animal‚Äîan advanced-media freak, always eating\\". Early in the film, Hoffman explains to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, which increases the worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. The terrorists avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer a different point of view throughout) technology. David Denby of The New Yorker said that this was Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East. Despite Hoffman's distance, the force and unintended consequences of his schemes are often borne by Ferris. The difference is underlined when Ferris, suffering weakened credibility, injured colleagues and personal risk, is reminded by Hoffman that \\"we are a results-driven organization\\". Production=Development In March 2006, Warner Bros. hired screenwriter William Monahan to adapt the novel Penetration by David Ignatius into a feature film, which would be directed by Ridley Scott. In April 2007, with the novel re-titled Body of Lies and the film similarly re-titled, actor Leonardo DiCaprio was cast in the lead role. DiCaprio chose to pursue the role because he considered it a throwback to political films in the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). DiCaprio dyed his hair brown, and wore brown contacts for the role. After DiCaprio was cast, Russell Crowe was courted for a supporting role, to which he formally committed after Monahan's script was revised by Steve Zaillian, who wrote Scott and Crowe's American Gangster. Crowe gained 63 pounds to suit his role.Crowe:Drinking different as Dad http://extra.warnerbros.com, September 30, 2008. Retrieved January 10, 2010 The actor said as a result of the film's exploration of the American government and foreign policy, \\"I don't think it will be very popular, but that‚Äôs never been part of my project choice process.\\" Mark Strong, who plays Hani Salaam, the head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (GID) ascribed his casting to his performances in the 2005 films Syriana and Oliver Twist. The character Haani Salaam was modelled after the 2000‚Äì2005 GID chief Saad Kheir (1953‚Äì2009), whose involvement, according to the original author David Ignatius, in sharply handled interrogations without the use of torture, an encounter with a jihadist with his mother on the phone and being called the 'fingernail boss' were near accurately featured in the film. Location and design Scott sought to film in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, but the federation's National Media Council denied the director permission due to the script's politically sensitive nature. As a result, scenes set in Jordan were instead filmed in Morocco. The shoot took place over sixty-five days from September to December 2007. It was filmed in the United States and Morocco, where scenes set in ten different countries were filmed.Thompson, Patricia Middle East Intrigue American Cinematographer, October 2008. Retrieved January 22, 2011. Filming began on September 5, 2007 at the Eastern Market, Washington, D.C. Practical locations were used throughout; part of the Capitol Hill neighborhood was converted to resemble a wintry Amsterdam to film a ten- to fifteen-second car bomb explosion. Scenes set in the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia were filmed at the National Geographic offices in Gaithersburg, Maryland; both buildings were set in woodland and \\"It was eerily similar in terms of architectural style,...\\", said Arthur Max, the production designer, \\"We were given several empty floors.\\" Locations in Baltimore also stood in for Manchester, England and Munich, Germany, although the final cut of the movie did not have any scenes that took place in Munich. Production moved to Morocco, where Scott, Max and Alexander Witt, the cinematographer had filmed several times before. Their previous experience meant they \\"knew every stone in the desert\\" and they were allowed access to many locations, including the Ministry of Finance, which was dressed as Jordan's secret service headquarters, Casablanca airport and a military airfield. The basketball stadium in Rabat was used as the U.S. embassy in Jordan: a CIA office set was built inside the stadium, favoured because its design allowed the cameras to shoot both interior and exterior vistas, thus showing the characters looking out on people and tanks passing in the streets. A nine-week shoot also took place at CLA Studios and in the desert around the city of Ouarzazate. Cinematography Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a director of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert. Scott is known for his skill at filming with multiple camera set-ups and Body of Lies used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, \\"Actors like multiple cameras because they‚Äôre always on-camera, so they‚Äôre always in character and not wasting time off-camera.\\" One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs. Richard Cronn, the gaffer, attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, \\"Ridley will stand at the monitors and tell you what's he's looking for ‚Äì he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He knows exactly how he will cut it.\\" In line with the film's use of practical locations, the photography and design departments worked together to incorporate practical light sources such as \\"lots of bare bulbs, lots of primitive fixtures\\". In the climactic torture scene, filmed in an ancient, windowless prison cell outside of Rabat, they used only diegetic light: two strong torches carried by the actors playing the torturers. It was filmed with three cameras and bounce cards were used to reflect light onto the actors' faces. Just a little smoke was sprayed in to augment the atmosphere but not dull the contrast. Scott has used many gradations of lens filter in the past, but declined to do so on Body of Lies. One obtains better finesse using the digital intermediate during post-production and does not risk losing light while selecting filters during expensive on-set time. The filmmakers strove for authenticity and realism in the images, and as such little colouration was added after, and the natural contrast of colours between the locations in Washington and Morocco were allowed to show through. In the film, images from unmanned aerial drones show the viewer the point of view of CIA commanders in Washington. These were filmed by John Marzano (Aerial Director Of Photography) using a helicopter mounted with a Wescam 35 on the nose of a helicopter, and Cineflex's V14 surveillance system, hanging from the side. Its 1‚Äì40 zoom allowed the filmmakers to fly very high and then zoom out of Ferris strolling through a market-place, creating the film's final shot. Music The film score was composed by Marc Streitenfeld, who has now composed music for Ridley Scott for three features. He recorded the orchestral portions of his score at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers Studios. Of note is the presence of a song in the film named \\"If the World\\", performed by Guns N' Roses, and taken from their long-delayed Chinese Democracy album. The track plays over the beginning of the end credits, but is not included on the official film soundtrack. Streitenfeld also collaborated with Mike Patton and Serj Tankian on the song \\"Bird's Eye\\", which was written specially for the musical score of the film.Thill, Scott MP3: Serj Tankian, Mike Patton Tell Sonic Lies Listening Post, www.wired.com, October 13, 2008.

The single-disc region one release included surround sound and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish; the two-disc special edition included commentaries by the director, screenwright and original novel author, and a behind the scenes documentary; the Blu-ray edition also included additional commentary on the film's themes. Reception=Critical response Body of Lies received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 55%, based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"Body of Lies relies too heavily on the performances of DiCaprio and Crowe to lift it above a conventional espionage thriller.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film three out of four stars. He praised the \\"convincing\\" acting and \\"realistic locations and terse dialogue\\" but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, \\"Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible.\\" Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, \\"The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable,\\" he wrote, \\"but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention.\\" Lou Lumenick in the New York Post wrote that, \\"There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies\\" and Lisa Kennedy in The Denver Post summarised: \\"Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar.\\" Critics observed the film's adherence to conventions of the spy thriller genre; Ebert called it \\"a James Bond plot\\" and David Denby in The New Yorker pointed out the \\"usual tropes of the genre‚Äîsurveillance shots from drones, S.U.V.s tearing across the desert, explosions, scenes of torture\\" but praised Scott's superior management of space and timing. While Todd McCarthy in Variety praised the initial set-up and conceit of the plot device, he criticised the formulaic approach leading to a \\"cornball denouement\\". A. O. Scott in The New York Times wrote that director Scott's \\"professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity.\\" He added that he would have preferred the psychological tensions linking the three leading men were allowed develop further. Joe Neumaier wrote in the New York Daily News that the film \\"aims to be up-to-the-moment ‚Äì yet feels same-old, same-old.\\" Kennedy called the love story between DiCaprio and Farahani contrived, saying that while DiCaprio seemed more at home in those scenes, it made the film seem \\"foolish\\". Ebert thought the cultural context of their relationship was well established, but that it essentially existed as a convenience of the plot, to set up the unlikely conclusion. Mark Strong's performance was mentioned by several critics, with Scott calling it \\"a marvel of exotic suavity and cool insinuation\\" while Ebert \\"particularly admired\\" his aura of suave control. Box office Body of Lies earned $12.9 million on its first weekend in theatres in the United States and Canada, 40% less than expected. This placed it as the third highest earning film that weekend, behind Disney's Beverly Hills Chihuahua, which turned out to be No. 1 with a take of $17.5 million in its second week, and Sony/Screen Gems's Quarantine, which earned $14.2 million‚Äîabout $2 million more than it cost to make. A Warner Bros. executive said he was disappointed with the film's opening and attributed it to its controversial storyline, although Body of Lies fared better than previous pictures about the \\"war on terrorism\\" such as Rendition, In the Valley of Elah, and Lions for Lambs, which all performed well below studios' expectations.

In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism.

It is based on the true story of a woman who strangled her lover during a love-making session, then severed his penis, which she carried with her until her arrest.Weisser, p.359. The story became a national sensation in Japan in 1936, developing mythic overtones, and has since been interpreted by artists, philosophers, novelists and filmmakers. Plot Over a black screen, Sada Abe (Junko Miyashita) tells some of the aliases she had used in her past. The opening concludes when the words \\"Kichi Sada 2\\" appear on the screen, followed by a newspaper headline, \\"Document: Sada Abe,\\" which is the Japanese title of the film. The lovers, Sada and Kichi (Hideaki Esumi) are then shown together, with Kichi predicting that he will die if their love-making continues. Soldiers pass the couple as they enter an inn, placing the story in the context of Japan's military build-up. They engage in a love-making session which lasts between April 23 and May 7, 1936. Some of their S&M; games involve knives, biting and mutual strangulation. When Kichi leaves Sada for a shave, she jealously accuses him of \\"committing adultery\\" on her with his wife. Soldiers are seen marching past a crowd which is listening to a report of the \\"February 26 Incident\\" on the radio. Sada and Kichi, uninterested, leave the crowd to continue their love-making. After strangling each other with their obis (kimono sashes), Kichi's neck is red, and Sada sends for a doctor. Kichi is told to go on a liquid diet, and he plans to return home for two months to recover. Sada is upset at losing Kichi, and spills all of his medicine. During another love-making session, Kichi invites Sada to strangle him again, telling her not to stop half-way this time, since it would be too painful afterwards. After killing him, Sada rubs her breasts against Kichi's face, attempts to feed him beer, and then castrates him. She then cuts herself and writes \\"Kichi Sada 2\\" with her blood on his body. During the progress of this scene, Sada's past life is told in flashbacks. She is banished from her wealthy family after losing her virginity to rape. She wanders around Japan working as a prostitute and bar-maid, eventually finding employment at the current inn where she met Kichi. The final sequence has her crime discovered and becoming a national sensation. Sada, while discussing the story with a masseur who is unaware of her identity, says that Sada must have loved Kichi very much since she wanted the whole country to know about them. The film ends with Sada's arrest.Synopsis based on and Weisser, p.356. Comparison with In the Realm of the Senses Tanaka's version of the Sada Abe story is inevitably compared with Nagisa Oshima's internationally-known In the Realm of the Senses. The most obvious difference between the two is that Tanaka's film, intended for a Japanese audience, could not indulge in the hardcore elements that Oshima's version employed. As a result, Oshima's film, when shown in Japan, was censored, while Tanaka's version played as the director intended it.Thompson, p.1572. While Oshima limits his timeframe to the period of the final sexual encounter, Tanaka gives a more rounded portrayal of Abe's life through flashbacks. While Oshima takes an objective, cool attitude towards the characters, Tanaka takes a warm approach to the subjects, concentrating on the passion between the two lovers. Set almost exclusively in the small room in the inn, Tanaka uses popular songs not only to set up situations, but also to express the emotions of the characters. Tanaka's skillful use of a variety of camera angles prevents the limited setting from becoming monotonous or claustrophobic. Both Oshima's and Tanaka's versions were highly regarded by critics in Japan, and both films were considered among the top-ten releases for their years. Critical appraisal Midnight Eye's review of A Woman Called Sada Abe compares it to In the Realm of the Senses, notes, \\"Aside from being less sexually explicit, it is also smaller scale, more intimate, more cinematically stylised and arguably more erotic.\\" A Woman Called Sada Abe is generally considered one of Nikkatsu's five best Roman porno films. Many Japanese critics consider it to be superior to Oshima's film, and Junko Miyashita is called a more realistic Sada Abe than Eiko Matsuda. Miyashita's performance has been judged one of the best of her career, and the film has been called director Tanaka's masterpiece. A Woman Called Sada Abe was a major box-office success in Japan, and it has been suggested that the success of Tanaka's film caused Oshima to distribute his film internationally before releasing it in Japan.Weisser, p.208. Along with the earlier Roman Porno film, Wife to be Sacrificed (1974), A Woman Called Sada Abe was released to an enthusiastic reception in San Francisco in 1998.

His son Ansgar (Wolfram Grandezka) fought his entire life to live up to the high pressure his father put on him and his oldest daughter Carla (Claudia Hiersche) kept her homosexuality a secret for a long time. His marriage to Francesca was hardly smooth, both had multiple affairs and illegitimate children. Francesca fell in love with Johannes's friend Adrian Degenhardt (Klaus Zmorek), who fathered her sons Leonard (Lars Korten) and Constantin (Milan Marcus). While it was clear that Constantin wasn't Johannes's son, Leonard was believed to be his child and was also Johannes's favorite. Francesca died in a tragic car accident when Ansgar, Carla and Leonard were young adults. Johannes couldn't raise a child that wasn't his and sent Constantin to Italy to be raised by Francesca's sister, Carlotta. Johannes also had two illegitimate daughters, Sarah Hoffman with Elke K√§ppler and Nico von Lahnstein with Vera Brandner. He was not aware of either of them until they were adults. In 2003, Johannes meets the beautiful and young C√©cile de Maron (Yvonne Burbach) and falls in love with her. Even though, C√©cile needs a little bit time to let Johannes in her heart, they become a couple. Carla doesn't like C√©cile from the beginning, because she doesn't think that a woman of Carla's age could fall for her father. C√©cile tries to prove Carla wrong, but she keeps her doubts. It doesn't take Johannes long and he proposes. C√©cile thinks it is too soon for them to get married, but then agrees anyway. She and Johannes celebrate their happiness with a big wedding. Soon after the wedding, Leonard comes back from the United States, where he went to college to study medicine. He and C√©cile meet by accident, before he even arrives at Castle K√∂nigsbrunn and is stunned by her beauty. He later gets the surprise of his life, when Johannes presents the young woman as his new wife. Leonard tries to stay distance to the married couple and even suggests to go back to Chicago. But Johannes is so excited that Leonard returned and wants his son to stay. C√©cile eventually begins to fall deeply for Leonard and so does he. They end up having a secret affair with each other, while Johannes has the wish to have another child with C√©cile. She tries to end her affair with Leonard and work on her marriage, but time and time again Leonard and C√©cile can't stay away from each other. C√©cile then decides to finally work on her marriage, when Johannes feels that she is slipping away. She ends thing with Leonard and tells him that they have no future together. Leonard then gets involved with his ex-girlfriend Silke Voss (Annette Culp), whom he dated for a while in Chicago. With no future for him and C√©cile, he reunites with Silke and Johannes is happy, when Leonard announces that he and Silke will get married, while C√©cile gets jealous. In January 2008, ten days after his 58th birthday, Johannes had a business trip his plane crashed into the ocean. Johannes died. Shortly before he changed his last will and made his daughter Carla to the heir of the Lahnstein dynasty. However, his son Ansgar faked his will after Johannes was found presumed death and made his son Hannes (Daniel and Simon K√ºhn) to the main heir.

This model proposes that star formation propagates via the action of shock waves produced by stellar winds and supernovae traversing the gas that composes the interstellar medium. The Henize 206 nebula provides a clear example. In particular, 24Œº infrared (MIPS) emission shows where a new generation of stars heats the remains of the supernova remnant that induced their formation. In contrast to star formation in density-wave theories, which are limited to disk-shaped galaxies and produce global spiral patterns, SSPSF applies equally well to spirals, to irregular galaxies and to any local concentrations of gas in elliptical galaxies. The effect may be envisioned as an \\"SIR infection model\\" in a differentially rotating disk, the host galaxy. The SIR model (perhaps most popularly familiar in the form of Conway's Game of Life) is applied to star formation propagating through the galaxy: Each generation of stars in a neighborhood includes some massive ones whose stellar winds and, soon, supernovae, produce shock waves in the gas (Susceptible material). These lead to collapsing nearby gas clouds, which produce the next generation of stars (Infection propagation); but in the immediate neighborhood, all initially available gas is used, so no further stars are born there for some period of time despite the shocks (Recovery from infection). SSPSF simulation In a non- flattened galaxy, the infection would produce an outward propagating sphere. In a non-rotating flattened (disk) environment, the infection would produce an outward propagating ring. But in a differentially rotating flattened environment, i.e., with mass closer to the galactic center orbiting the center somewhat more quickly, the ring is sheared into an ellipse, the innermost parts moving ahead of the ring's center and the outermost parts lagging. For disk galaxies, virtually all star formation occurs in the disk. In that case, the elongated rings are likewise confined to the disk, and collectively they evolve to appear as (possibly disconnected) segments of spiral arms: See (e.g) NGC 4414, as well as figures in. In 1999, the prevailing density wave model for the generation of spiral arms in galaxies was combined with SSPSF in a doctoral thesis by Auer (an idea first suggested by Gerola and Seiden in 1980). Auer concluded that density waves are in fact less effective in producing star formation, and more effective in simply organizing ongoing SSPSF into large-scale (spiral) patterns, ultimately into the Grand Design spiral form if conditions allow. In the figure you can see a simulation of a simple model for SSPSF on a circular grid. It is generated by randomly starting star formation in certain boxes of the grid, which propagates to nearby boxes in the grid while time progresses. Star formation dies out with time and a box has a certain regeneration time which prevents it from starting new star formation just after it was active. Adding (differential) rotation to the disk during propagation creates spiral patterns that are of the same nature of those in actual spiral galaxies. Dark spots are areas of active star formation, lighter spots are areas of recent star formation/areas in regeneration.

It was triggered by a large decline in home prices after the collapse of a housing bubble, leading to mortgage delinquencies, foreclosures, and the devaluation of housing-related securities. Declines in residential investment preceded the Great Recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then business investment. Spending reductions were more significant in areas with a combination of high household debt and larger housing price declines. The housing bubble preceding the crisis was financed with mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which initially offered higher interest rates (i.e. better returns) than government securities, along with attractive risk ratings from rating agencies. While elements of the crisis first became more visible during 2007, several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession. There were many causes of the crisis, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, government housing policies, and consumers, among others. Two proximate causes were the rise in subprime lending and the increase in housing speculation. The percentage of lower- quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8% or lower range to approximately 20% from 2004 to 2006, with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S.Michael Simkovic, Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization A high percentage of these subprime mortgages, over 90% in 2006 for example, had an interest rate that increased over time. Housing speculation also increased, with the share of mortgage originations to investors (i.e. those owning homes other than primary residences) rising significantly from around 20% in 2000 to around 35% in 2006‚Äì2007. Investors, even those with prime credit ratings, were much more likely to default than non-investors when prices fell. These changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products, which contributed to U.S. households becoming increasingly indebted. The ratio of household debt to disposable personal income rose from 77% in 1990 to 127% by the end of 2007. When U.S. home prices declined steeply after peaking in mid-2006, it became more difficult for borrowers to refinance their loans. As adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates (causing higher monthly payments), mortgage delinquencies soared. Securities backed with mortgages, including subprime mortgages, widely held by financial firms globally, lost most of their value. Global investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgage-backed debt and other securities as part of a decline in the capacity and willingness of the private financial system to support lending. Concerns about the soundness of U.S. credit and financial markets led to tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the U.S. and Europe. The crisis had severe, long-lasting consequences for the U.S. and European economies. The U.S. entered a deep recession, with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009, roughly 6% of the workforce. The number of jobs did not return to the December 2007 pre-crisis peak until May 2014. U.S. household net worth declined by nearly $13 trillion (20%) from its Q2 2007 pre-crisis peak, recovering by Q4 2012. U.S. housing prices fell nearly 30% on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50% by early 2009, with stocks regaining their December 2007 level during September 2012. One estimate of lost output and income from the crisis comes to \\"at least 40% of 2007 gross domestic product\\". Europe also continued to struggle with its own economic crisis, with elevated unemployment and severe banking impairments estimated at ‚Ç¨940 billion between 2008 and 2012. As of January 2018, U.S. bailout funds had been fully recovered by the government, when interest on loans is taken into consideration. A total of $626B was invested, loaned, or granted due to various bailout measures, while $390B had been returned to the Treasury. The Treasury had earned another $323B in interest on bailout loans, resulting in an $87B profit. Background and timeline of events President George W. Bush discusses Education, Entrepreneurship & Home Ownership at the Indiana Black Expo in 2005 Subprime mortgage lending jumped dramatically during the 2004‚Äì2006 period preceding the crisis (source: Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Report, p. 70 Figure 5.2). Federal funds rate history and recessions Factors contributing to housing bubble Domino effect as housing prices declined The immediate cause of the crisis was the bursting of the United States housing bubble which peaked in approximately 2005‚Äì2006. An increase in loan incentives such as easy initial terms and a long-term trend of rising housing prices had encouraged borrowers to assume risky mortgages in the anticipation that they would be able to quickly refinance at easier terms. However, once interest rates began to rise and housing prices started to drop moderately in 2006‚Äì2007 in many parts of the U.S., borrowers were unable to refinance. Defaults and foreclosure activity increased dramatically as easy initial terms expired, home prices fell, and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) interest rates reset higher. As housing prices fell, global investor demand for mortgage-related securities evaporated. This became apparent by July 2007, when investment bank Bear Stearns announced that two of its hedge funds had imploded. These funds had invested in securities that derived their value from mortgages. When the value of these securities dropped, investors demanded that these hedge funds provide additional collateral. This created a cascade of selling in these securities, which lowered their value further. Economist Mark Zandi wrote that this 2007 event was \\"arguably the proximate catalyst\\" for the financial market disruption that followed. Several other factors set the stage for the rise and fall of housing prices, and related securities widely held by financial firms. In the years leading up to the crisis, the U.S. received large amounts of foreign money from fast-growing economies in Asia and oil-producing/exporting countries. This inflow of funds combined with low U.S. interest rates from 2002 to 2004 contributed to easy credit conditions, which fueled both housing and credit bubbles. Loans of various types (e.g., mortgage, credit card, and auto) were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load. As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which derive their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in MBS reported significant losses. Defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy. Total losses were estimated in the trillions of U.S. dollars globally. While the housing and credit bubbles were growing, a series of factors caused the financial system to become increasingly fragile. Policymakers did not recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds, also known as the shadow banking system. These entities were not subject to the same regulations as depository banking. Further, shadow banks were able to mask the extent of their risk taking from investors and regulators through the use of complex, off-balance sheet derivatives and securitizations. Economist Gary Gorton has referred to the 2007‚Äì2008 aspects of the crisis as a \\"run\\" on the shadow banking system. The complexity of these off-balance sheet arrangements and the securities held, as well as the interconnection between larger financial institutions, made it virtually impossible to re-organize them via bankruptcy, which contributed to the need for government bailouts. Some experts believe these shadow institutions had become as important as commercial (depository) banks in providing credit to the U.S. economy, but they were not subject to the same regulations. These institutions as well as certain regulated banks had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or MBS losses. The losses experienced by financial institutions on their mortgage-related securities impacted their ability to lend, slowing economic activity. Interbank lending dried-up initially and then loans to non-financial firms were affected. Concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to take action to provide funds to encourage lending and to restore faith in the commercial paper markets, which are integral to funding business operations. Governments also bailed out key financial institutions, assuming significant additional financial commitments. The risks to the broader economy created by the housing market downturn and subsequent financial market crisis were primary factors in several decisions by central banks around the world to cut interest rates and governments to implement economic stimulus packages. Effects on global stock markets due to the crisis were dramatic. Between 1 January and 11 October 2008, owners of stocks in U.S. corporations suffered about $8 trillion in losses, as their holdings declined in value from $20 trillion to $12 trillion. Losses in other countries averaged about 40%.Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2008, p. 1 Losses in the stock markets and housing value declines place further downward pressure on consumer spending, a key economic engine. Leaders of the larger developed and emerging nations met in November 2008 and March 2009 to formulate strategies for addressing the crisis. A variety of solutions have been proposed by government officials, central bankers, economists, and business executives. In the U.S., the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010 to address some of the causes of the crisis. Causes=Overview Housing price appreciation in selected countries, 2002‚Äì2008 U.S. households and financial businesses significantly increased borrowing (leverage) in the years leading up to the crisis The crisis can be attributed to several factors, which emerged over a number of years. Causes proposed include the inability of homeowners to make their mortgage payments (due primarily to adjustable-rate mortgages resetting, borrowers overextending, predatory lending, and speculation), overbuilding during the boom period, risky mortgage products, increased power of mortgage originators, high personal and corporate debt levels, financial products that distributed and perhaps concealed the risk of mortgage default, monetary and housing policies that encouraged risk-taking and more debt, international trade imbalances, and inappropriate government regulation. Excessive consumer housing debt was in turn caused by the mortgage-backed security, credit default swap, and collateralized debt obligation sub-sectors of the finance industry, which were offering irrationally low interest rates and irrationally high levels of approval to subprime mortgage consumers due in part to faulty financial models. Debt consumers were acting in their rational self-interest, because they were unable to audit the finance industry's opaque faulty risk pricing methodology. Among the important catalysts of the subprime crisis were the influx of money from the private sector, the banks entering into the mortgage bond market, government policies aimed at expanding homeownership, speculation by many home buyers, and the predatory lending practices of the mortgage lenders, specifically the adjustable-rate mortgage, 2‚Äì28 loan, that mortgage lenders sold directly or indirectly via mortgage brokers.Ramlall, I., The Impact of the Subprime Crisis on Global Financial Markets, Banks and (Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2013), pp. 5‚Äì31. On Wall Street and in the financial industry, moral hazard lay at the core of many of the causes. In its \\"Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy,\\" dated 15 November 2008, leaders of the Group of 20 cited the following causes: Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke testified in September 2010 regarding the causes of the crisis. He wrote that there were shocks or triggers (i.e., particular events that touched off the crisis) and vulnerabilities (i.e., structural weaknesses in the financial system, regulation and supervision) that amplified the shocks. Examples of triggers included: losses on subprime mortgage securities that began in 2007 and a run on the shadow banking system that began in mid-2007, which adversely affected the functioning of money markets. Examples of vulnerabilities in the private sector included: financial institution dependence on unstable sources of short-term funding such as repurchase agreements or Repos; deficiencies in corporate risk management; excessive use of leverage (borrowing to invest); and inappropriate usage of derivatives as a tool for taking excessive risks. Examples of vulnerabilities in the public sector included: statutory gaps and conflicts between regulators; ineffective use of regulatory authority; and ineffective crisis management capabilities. Bernanke also discussed \\"Too big to fail\\" institutions, monetary policy, and trade deficits. During May 2010, Warren Buffett and Paul Volcker separately described questionable assumptions or judgments underlying the U.S. financial and economic system that contributed to the crisis. These assumptions included: 1) Housing prices would not fall dramatically; 2) Free and open financial markets supported by sophisticated financial engineering would most effectively support market efficiency and stability, directing funds to the most profitable and productive uses; 3) Concepts embedded in mathematics and physics could be directly adapted to markets, in the form of various financial models used to evaluate credit risk; 4) Economic imbalances, such as large trade deficits and low savings rates indicative of over-consumption, were sustainable; and 5) Stronger regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives markets was not needed. Economists surveyed by the University of Chicago during 2017 rated the factors that caused the crisis in order of importance: 1) Flawed financial sector regulation and supervision; 2) Underestimating risks in financial engineering (e.g., CDOs); 3) Mortgage fraud and bad incentives; 4) Short-term funding decisions and corresponding runs in those markets (e.g., repo); and 5) Credit rating agency failures.IGM Forum-Factors Contributing to 2008 Global Financial Crisis-October 17, 2017 The U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that \\"the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels.\\" Narratives U.S. residential and non-residential investment fell relative to GDP during the crisis There are several \\"narratives\\" attempting to place the causes of the crisis into context, with overlapping elements. Five such narratives include: #There was the equivalent of a bank run on the shadow banking system, which includes investment banks and other non-depository financial entities. This system had grown to rival the depository system in scale yet was not subject to the same regulatory safeguards. #The economy was being driven by a housing bubble. When it burst, private residential investment (i.e., housing construction) fell by nearly 4% GDP and consumption enabled by bubble-generated housing wealth also slowed. This created a gap in annual demand (GDP) of nearly $1 trillion. Government was unwilling to make up for this private sector shortfall. #Record levels of household debt accumulated in the decades preceding the crisis resulted in a balance sheet recession (similar to debt deflation) once housing prices began falling in 2006. Consumers began paying down debt, which reduces their consumption, slowing down the economy for an extended period while debt levels are reduced. #Housing speculation using high levels of mortgage debt drove many investors with prime-quality mortgages (i.e., those investors in the middle of the credit score distribution) to default and enter foreclosure on investment properties when housing prices fell; the blame on \\"subprime\\" homeowners (i.e., those at the bottom of the credit score distribution) was overstated. #Government policies that encouraged home ownership even for those who could not afford it, contributing to lax lending standards, unsustainable housing price increases, and indebtedness. Underlying narratives #1-3 is a hypothesis that growing income inequality and wage stagnation encouraged families to increase their household debt to maintain their desired living standard, fueling the bubble. Further, this greater share of income flowing to the top increased the political power of business interests, who used that power to deregulate or limit regulation of the shadow banking system. Housing marketBoom and bust= Household debt relative to disposable income and GDP. Existing homes sales, inventory, and months supply, by quarter. Vicious cycles in the housing and financial markets. According to Robert J. Shiller and other economists, housing price increases beyond the general inflation rate are not sustainable in the long term. From the end of World War II to the beginning of the housing bubble in 1997, housing prices in the US remained relatively stable.Shiller, R. J., Irrational Exuberance: Revised and Expanded Third Edition (Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2015), 19‚Äì21. The bubble was characterized by higher rates of household debt and lower savings rates, slightly higher rates of home ownership, and of course higher housing prices. It was fueled by low interest rates and large inflows of foreign funds that created easy credit conditions. Between 1997 and 2006 (the peak of the housing bubble), the price of the typical American house increased by 124%. From 1980 to 2001, the ratio of median home prices to median household income (a measure of ability to buy a house) fluctuated from 2.9 to 3.1. In 2004 it rose to 4.0, and by 2006 it hit 4.6. The housing bubble was more pronounced in coastal areas where the ability to build new housing was restricted by geography or land use restrictions. This housing bubble resulted in quite a few homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates, or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation. US household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990.NYT-Krugman-Block those Economic Metaphors, December 12, 2010 While housing prices were increasing, consumers were saving less and both borrowing and spending more. Household debt grew from $705 billion at year end 1974, 60% of disposable personal income, to $7.4 trillion at yearend 2000, and finally to $14.5 trillion in midyear 2008, 134% of disposable personal income.Z.1 Historical Tables (1974) and current Z.1 release (2008) , Table B.100, lines 31,48. During 2008, the typical US household owned 13 credit cards, with 40% of households carrying a balance, up from 6% in 1970. Free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, a total of nearly $5 trillion over the period. U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 trillion. From 2001 to 2007, U.S. mortgage debt almost doubled, and the amount of mortgage debt per household rose more than 63%, from $91,500 to $149,500, with essentially stagnant wages. Economist Tyler Cowen explained that the economy was highly dependent on this home equity extraction: \\"In the 1993‚Äì1997 period, home owners extracted an amount of equity from their homes equivalent to 2.3% to 3.8% GDP. By 2005, this figure had increased to 11.5% GDP.\\" This credit and house price explosion led to a building boom and eventually to a surplus of unsold homes, which caused U.S. housing prices to peak and begin declining in mid-2006. Easy credit, and a belief that house prices would continue to appreciate, had encouraged many subprime borrowers to obtain adjustable-rate mortgages. These mortgages enticed borrowers with a below market interest rate for some predetermined period, followed by market interest rates for the remainder of the mortgage's term. The US home ownership rate increased from 64% in 1994 (about where it had been since 1980) to an all-time high of 69.2% in 2004. Subprime lending was a major contributor to this increase in home ownership rates and in the overall demand for housing, which drove prices higher. Borrowers who would not be able to make the higher payments once the initial grace period ended, were planning to refinance their mortgages after a year or two of appreciation. As a result of the depreciating housing prices, borrowers‚Äô ability to refinance became more difficult. Borrowers who found themselves unable to escape higher monthly payments by refinancing began to default. As more borrowers stopped making their mortgage payments, foreclosures and the supply of homes for sale increased. This placed downward pressure on housing prices, which further lowered homeowners' equity. The decline in mortgage payments also reduced the value of mortgage-backed securities, which eroded the net worth and financial health of banks. This vicious cycle was at the heart of the crisis. By September 2008, average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20% from their mid-2006 peak. This major and unexpected decline in house prices means that many borrowers have zero or negative equity in their homes, meaning their homes were worth less than their mortgages. As of March 2008, an estimated 8.8 million borrowers ‚Äì 10.8% of all homeowners ‚Äì had negative equity in their homes, a number that is believed to have risen to 12 million by November 2008. By September 2010, 23% of all U.S. homes were worth less than the mortgage loan. Borrowers in this situation have an incentive to default on their mortgages as a mortgage is typically nonrecourse debt secured against the property. Economist Stan Leibowitz argued in the Wall Street Journal that although only 12% of homes had negative equity, they comprised 47% of foreclosures during the second half of 2008. He concluded that the extent of equity in the home was the key factor in foreclosure, rather than the type of loan, credit worthiness of the borrower, or ability to pay. Increasing foreclosure rates increases the inventory of houses offered for sale. The number of new homes sold in 2007 was 26.4% less than in the preceding year. By January 2008, the inventory of unsold new homes was 9.8 times the December 2007 sales volume, the highest value of this ratio since 1981. Furthermore, nearly four million existing homes were for sale, of which roughly 2.2 million were vacant. This overhang of unsold homes lowered house prices. As prices declined, more homeowners were at risk of default or foreclosure. House prices are expected to continue declining until this inventory of unsold homes (an instance of excess supply) declines to normal levels. A report in January 2011 stated that U.S. home values dropped by 26 percent from their peak in June 2006 to November 2010, more than the 25.9% drop between 1928 to 1933 when the Great Depression occurred. From September 2008 to September 2012, there were approximately 4 million completed foreclosures in the U.S. As of September 2012, approximately 1.4 million homes, or 3.3% of all homes with a mortgage, were in some stage of foreclosure compared to 1.5 million, or 3.5%, in September 2011. During September 2012, 57,000 homes completed foreclosure; this is down from 83,000 the prior September but well above the 2000‚Äì2006 average of 21,000 completed foreclosures per month. =Homeowner speculation= Speculative borrowing in residential real estate has been cited as a contributing factor to the subprime mortgage crisis. During 2006, 22% of homes purchased (1.65 million units) were for investment purposes, with an additional 14% (1.07 million units) purchased as vacation homes. During 2005, these figures were 28% and 12%, respectively. In other words, a record level of nearly 40% of homes purchased were not intended as primary residences. David Lereah, National Association of Realtors's chief economist at the time, stated that the 2006 decline in investment buying was expected: \\"Speculators left the market in 2006, which caused investment sales to fall much faster than the primary market.\\" Housing prices nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006, a vastly different trend from the historical appreciation at roughly the rate of inflation. While homes had not traditionally been treated as investments subject to speculation, this behavior changed during the housing boom. Media widely reported condominiums being purchased while under construction, then being \\"flipped\\" (sold) for a profit without the seller ever having lived in them. Some mortgage companies identified risks inherent in this activity as early as 2005, after identifying investors assuming highly leveraged positions in multiple properties. One 2017 NBER study argued that real estate investors (i.e., those owning 2+ homes) were more to blame for the crisis than subprime borrowers: \\"The rise in mortgage defaults during the crisis was concentrated in the middle of the credit score distribution, and mostly attributable to real estate investors\\" and that \\"credit growth between 2001 and 2007 was concentrated in the prime segment, and debt to high-risk [subprime] borrowers was virtually constant for all debt categories during this period.\\" The authors argued that this investor-driven narrative was more accurate than blaming the crisis on lower-income, subprime borrowers. A 2011 Fed study had a similar finding: \\"In states that experienced the largest housing booms and busts, at the peak of the market almost half of purchase mortgage originations were associated with investors. In part by apparently misreporting their intentions to occupy the property, investors took on more leverage, contributing to higher rates of default.\\" The Fed study reported that mortgage originations to investors rose from 25% in 2000 to 45% in 2006, for Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada overall, where housing price increases during the bubble (and declines in the bust) were most pronounced. In these states, investor delinquency rose from around 15% in 2000 to over 35% in 2007 and 2008. Nicole Gelinas of the Manhattan Institute described the negative consequences of not adjusting tax and mortgage policies to the shifting treatment of a home from conservative inflation hedge to speculative investment. Economist Robert Shiller argued that speculative bubbles are fueled by \\"contagious optimism, seemingly impervious to facts, that often takes hold when prices are rising. Bubbles are primarily social phenomena; until we understand and address the psychology that fuels them, they're going to keep forming.\\" Keynesian economist Hyman Minsky described how speculative borrowing contributed to rising debt and an eventual collapse of asset values. Warren Buffett testified to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission: \\"There was the greatest bubble I've ever seen in my life...The entire American public eventually was caught up in a belief that housing prices could not fall dramatically.\\" =High-risk mortgage loans and lending/borrowing practices= A mortgage brokerage in the US advertising subprime mortgages in July 2008. In the years before the crisis, the behavior of lenders changed dramatically. Lenders offered more and more loans to higher-risk borrowers, including undocumented immigrants. Lending standards deteriorated particularly between 2004 and 2007, as the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage market share (i.e. the share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which specialized in conventional, conforming, non-subprime mortgages) declined and private securitizers share grew, rising to more than half of mortgage securitizations. Historically less than 2% of homebuyers lost their homes to foreclosure. But by 2009 over 40% of subprime adjustable rate mortgages were past due. (source: Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, p.217, figure 11.2) Subprime mortgages grew from 5% of total originations ($35 billion) in 1994, to 20% ($600 billion) in 2006. Another indicator of a \\"classic\\" boom-bust credit cycle, was a closing in the difference between subprime and prime mortgage interest rates (the \\"subprime markup\\") between 2001 and 2007. In addition to considering higher- risk borrowers, lenders had offered progressively riskier loan options and borrowing incentives. In 2005, the median down payment for first-time home buyers was 2%, with 43% of those buyers making no down payment whatsoever. By comparison, China has down payment requirements that exceed 20%, with higher amounts for non-primary residences. Growth in mortgage loan fraud based upon US Department of the Treasury Suspicious Activity Report Analysis To produce more mortgages and more securities, mortgage qualification guidelines became progressively looser. First, \\"stated income, verified assets\\" (SIVA) loans replaced proof of income with a \\"statement\\" of it. Then, \\"no income, verified assets\\" (NIVA) loans eliminated proof of employment requirements. Borrowers needed only to show proof of money in their bank accounts. \\"No Income, No Assets\\" (NINA) or Ninja loans eliminated the need to prove, or even to state any owned assets. All that was required for a mortgage was a credit score. Types of mortgages became more risky as well. The interest-only adjustable- rate mortgage (ARM), allowed the homeowner to pay only the interest (not principal) of the mortgage during an initial \\"teaser\\" period. Even looser was the \\"payment option\\" loan, in which the homeowner has the option to make monthly payment that do not even cover the interest for the first two or three year initial period of the loan. Nearly one in 10 mortgage borrowers in 2005 and 2006 took out these \\"option ARM\\" loans, and an estimated one-third of ARMs originated between 2004 and 2006 had \\"teaser\\" rates below 4%. After the initial period, monthly payments might double or even triple. The proportion of subprime ARM loans made to people with credit scores high enough to qualify for conventional mortgages with better terms increased from 41% in 2000 to 61% by 2006. In addition, mortgage brokers in some cases received incentives from lenders to offer subprime ARM's even to those with credit ratings that merited a conforming (i.e., non-subprime) loan. Mortgage underwriting standards declined precipitously during the boom period. The use of automated loan approvals allowed loans to be made without appropriate review and documentation. In 2007, 40% of all subprime loans resulted from automated underwriting. The chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association claimed that mortgage brokers, while profiting from the home loan boom, did not do enough to examine whether borrowers could repay. Mortgage fraud by lenders and borrowers increased enormously. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in January 2011 that many mortgage lenders took eager borrowers' qualifications on faith, often with a \\"willful disregard\\" for a borrower's ability to pay. Nearly 25% of all mortgages made in the first half of 2005 were \\"interest-only\\" loans. During the same year, 68% of \\"option ARM\\" loans originated by Countrywide Financial and Washington Mutual had low- or no- documentation requirements. At least one study has suggested that the decline in standards was driven by a shift of mortgage securitization from a tightly controlled duopoly to a competitive market in which mortgage originators held the most sway. The worst mortgage vintage years coincided with the periods during which Government Sponsored Enterprises (specifically Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) were at their weakest, and mortgage originators and private label securitizers were at their strongest. Why was there a market for these low quality private label securitizations? In a Peabody Award winning program, NPR correspondents argued that a \\"Giant Pool of Money\\" (represented by $70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade. Further, this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage-backed security (MBS) and collateralized debt obligation (CDO), which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies. In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the U.S., with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain, from the mortgage broker selling the loans, to small banks that funded the brokers, to the giant investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted. However, continued strong demand for MBS and CDO began to drive down lending standards, as long as mortgages could still be sold along the supply chain. Eventually, this speculative bubble proved unsustainable. NPR described it this way: =Subprime mortgage market= Number of U.S. residential properties subject to foreclosure actions by quarter (2007‚Äì2012). Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit histories and reduced repayment capacity. Subprime loans have a higher risk of default than loans to prime borrowers. If a borrower is delinquent in making timely mortgage payments to the loan servicer (a bank or other financial firm), the lender may take possession of the property, in a process called foreclosure. The value of American subprime mortgages was estimated at $1.3 trillion as of March 2007, with over 7.5 million first-lien subprime mortgages outstanding. Between 2004 and 2006 the share of subprime mortgages relative to total originations ranged from 18%‚Äì21%, versus less than 10% in 2001‚Äì2003 and during 2007. The majority of subprime loans were issued in California. The boom in mortgage lending, including subprime lending, was also driven by a fast expansion of non-bank independent mortgage originators which despite their smaller share (around 25 percent in 2002) in the market have contributed to around 50 percent of the increase in mortgage credit between 2003 and 2005. In the third quarter of 2007, subprime ARMs making up only 6.9% of US mortgages outstanding also accounted for 43% of the foreclosures which began during that quarter. By October 2007, approximately 16% of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) were either 90-days delinquent or the lender had begun foreclosure proceedings, roughly triple the rate of 2005. By January 2008, the delinquency rate had risen to 21% and by May 2008 it was 25%. According to RealtyTrac, the value of all outstanding residential mortgages, owed by U.S. households to purchase residences housing at most four families, was US$9.9 trillion as of year-end 2006, and US$10.6 trillion as of midyear 2008.Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, Release Z.1, 9/18/08. Table L.218, line 2. Note that $1.1 trillion (line 22) of the $10.6 trillion total consisted of home equity loans. During 2007, lenders had begun foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties, a 79% increase over 2006. This increased to 2.3 million in 2008, an 81% increase vs. 2007, and again to 2.8 million in 2009, a 21% increase vs. 2008. By August 2008, 9.2% of all U.S. mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure. By September 2009, this had risen to 14.4%. Between August 2007 and October 2008, 936,439 US residences completed foreclosure. Foreclosures are concentrated in particular states both in terms of the number and rate of foreclosure filings. Ten states accounted for 74% of the foreclosure filings during 2008; the top two (California and Florida) represented 41%. Nine states were above the national foreclosure rate average of 1.84% of households. =Mortgage fraud and predatory lending= \\"The FBI defines mortgage fraud as 'the intentional misstatement, misrepresentation, or omission by an applicant or other interest parties, relied on by a lender or underwriter to provide funding for, to purchase, or to insure a mortgage loan.'\\"Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch (New York: Algora Publishing, 2012, 181. In 2004, the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned of an \\"epidemic\\" in mortgage fraud, an important credit risk of nonprime mortgage lending, which, they said, could lead to \\"a problem that could have as much impact as the S&L; crisis\\". Despite this, the Bush administration prevented states from investigating and prosecuting predatory lenders by invoking a banking law from 1863 \\"to issue formal opinions preempting all state predatory lending laws, thereby rendering them inoperative.\\" The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in January 2011 that: \\"... mortgage fraud... flourished in an environment of collapsing lending standards and lax regulation. The number of suspicious activity reports ‚Äì reports of possible financial crimes filed by depository banks and their affiliates ‚Äì related to mortgage fraud grew 20-fold between 1996 and 2005 and then more than doubled again between 2005 and 2009. One study places the losses resulting from fraud on mortgage loans made between 2005 and 2007 at $112 billion. \\"Predatory lending describes unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices of some lenders during the loan origination process.\\"Lenders made loans that they knew borrowers could not afford and that could cause massive losses to investors in mortgage securities.\\" Financial marketsBoom and collapse of the shadow banking system= Comparison of the growth of traditional banking and shadow bankingFinancial Crisis Inquiry Commission Report, figure 2.1, p. 32 The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in January 2011: > \\"In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections ‚Äì > the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, > ample regulations ‚Äì to provide a bulwark against the panics that had > regularly plagued America's banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over > the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system ‚Äì > opaque and laden with short term debt ‚Äì that rivaled the size of the > traditional banking system.

We had a > 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards.\\" In a June 2008 speech, President of the NY Federal Reserve Bank Timothy Geithner, who later became Secretary of the Treasury, placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a \\"run\\" on the entities in the \\"parallel\\" banking system, also called the shadow banking system. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls as depository banks. Further, these entities were vulnerable because they borrowed short- term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. Repo and other forms of shadow banking accounted for an estimated 60% of the \\"overall US banking system,\\" according to Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman. Geithner described its \\"entities\\": > \\"In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured > investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option > bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly > $2.2 trillion.

In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding > companies in the United States at that point were just over $6 trillion, and > total assets of the entire banking system were about $10 trillion.\\" He stated that the \\"combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles.\\" Krugman described the run on the shadow banking system as the \\"core of what happened\\" to cause the crisis. > As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional > banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have > realized that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that > made the Great Depression possible ‚Äì and they should have responded by > extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new > institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: > anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in > crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank. He referred to this lack of controls as \\"malign neglect.\\" The securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds. According to the Brookings Institution, the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of June 2009: \\"It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume.\\" The authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are \\"likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions.\\" Economist Gary Gorton wrote in May 2009: > Unlike the historical banking panics of the 19th and early 20th centuries, > the current banking panic is a wholesale panic, not a retail panic. In the > earlier episodes, depositors ran to their banks and demanded cash in > exchange for their checking accounts. Unable to meet those demands, the > banking system became insolvent. The current panic involved financial firms > \\"running\\" on other financial firms by not renewing sale and repurchase > agreements (repo) or increasing the repo margin (\\"haircut\\"), forcing massive > deleveraging, and resulting in the banking system being insolvent. Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in an interview with the FCIC during 2009 that 12 of the 13 largest U.S. financial institutions were at risk of failure during 2008. The FCIC report did not identify which of the 13 firms was not considered by Bernanke to be in danger of failure. Economist Mark Zandi testified to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in January 2010: > The securitization markets also remain impaired, as investors anticipate > more loan losses.

Private bond issuance of > residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed > securities, and CDOs peaked in 2006 at close to $2 trillion...In 2009, > private issuance was less than $150 billion, and almost all of it was asset- > backed issuance supported by the Federal Reserve's TALF program to aid > credit card, auto and small-business lenders. Issuance of residential and > commercial mortgage-backed securities and CDOs remains dormant. The Economist reported in March 2010: \\"Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were non-banks that were crippled by a silent run among panicky overnight \\"repo\\" lenders, many of them money market funds uncertain about the quality of securitized collateral they were holding. Mass redemptions from these funds after Lehman's failure froze short-term funding for big firms.\\" =Securitization= Borrowing under a securitization structure. IMF diagram of CDO and RMBS. Securitization ‚Äì the bundling of bank loans to create tradeable bonds ‚Äì started in the mortgage industry in the 1970s, when Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) began to pool relatively safe, conventional, \\"conforming\\" or \\"prime\\" mortgages, create \\"mortgage-backed securities\\" (MBS) from the pool, sell them to investors, guaranteeing these securities/bonds against default on the underlying mortgages. This \\"originate- to-distribute\\" model had advantages over the old \\"originate-to-hold\\" model, where a bank originated a loan to the borrower/homeowner and retained the credit (default) risk. Securitization removed the loans from a bank's books, enabling the bank to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws. More loans could be made with proceeds of the MBS sale. The liquidity of a national and even international mortgage market allowed capital to flow where mortgages were in demand and funding short. However, securitization created a moral hazard ‚Äì the bank/institution making the loan no longer had to worry if the mortgage was paid off ‚Äì giving them incentive to process mortgage transactions but not to ensure their credit quality. Bankers were no longer around to work out borrower problems and minimize defaults during the course of the mortgage.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 3 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). With the high down payments and credit scores of the conforming mortgages used by GSE, this danger was minimal. Investment banks however, wanted to enter the market and avoid competing with the GSEs. They did so by developing mortgage-backed securities in the riskier non-conforming subprime and Alt-A market. Unlike the GSEs the issuers generally did not guarantee the securities against default of the underlying mortgages. What these \\"private label\\" or \\"non-agency\\" originators did do was to use \\"structured finance\\" to create securities. Structuring involved \\"slicing\\" the pooled mortgages into \\"tranches\\", each having a different priority in the monthly or quarterly principal and interest stream. Tranches were compared to \\"buckets\\" catching the \\"water\\" of principal and interest. More senior buckets didn't share water with those below until they were filled to the brim and overflowing.Here's how a CDO works Upstart Business Journal December 5, 2007 This gave the top buckets/tranches considerable creditworthiness (in theory) that would earn the highest \\"triple A\\" credit ratings, making them salable to money market and pension funds that would not otherwise deal with subprime mortgage securities. To use up the MBS tranches lower in payback priority that could not be rated triple-A and that a conservative fixed income market would not buy, investment banks developed another security ‚Äì known as the collateralized debt obligation (CDO). Although the CDO market was smaller, it was crucial because unless buyers were found for the non-triple-A or \\"mezzanine\\" tranches, it would not be profitable to make a mortgage-backed security in the first place.Morgenson and Rosner Reckless Endangerment, 2010 p.278see also Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, p. 127 These CDOs pooled the leftover BBB, A-, etc. rated tranches, and produced new tranches ‚Äì 70%70%. \\"Firms bought mortgage-backed bonds with the very highest yields they could find and reassembled them into new CDOs. The original bonds ... could be lower-rated securities that once reassembled into a new CDO would wind up with as much as 70% of the tranches rated triple-A. Ratings arbitrage, Wall Street called this practice. A more accurate term would have been ratings laundering.\\" (source: McLean and Nocera, All the Devils Are Here, 2010 p. 122) to 80%80%. \\"In a CDO you gathered a 100 different mortgage bonds ‚Äì usually the riskiest lower floors of the original tower ...... They bear a lower credit rating triple B. ... if you could somehow get them rerated as triple A, thereby lowering their perceived risk, however dishonestly and artificially. This is what Goldman Sachs had cleverly done. It was absurd. The 100 buildings occupied the same floodplain; in the event of flood, the ground floors of all of them were equally exposed. But never mind: the rating agencies, who were paid fat fees by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms for each deal they rated, pronounced 80% of the new tower of debt triple-A.\\" (source: Michael Lewis, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine WW Norton and Co, 2010, p. 73) of which were rated triple A by rating agencies. The 20‚Äì30% remaining mezzanine tranches were sometimes bought up by other CDOs, to make so-called \\"CDO-Squared\\" securities which also produced tranches rated mostly triple A.\\"According to data compiled by the FCIC, tranches from CDOs rose from an average of 7% of the collateral in mortgage-backed CDOs in 2003 to 14% by 2007. CDO-squared deals ‚Äì those engineered primarily from the tranches of other CDOs ‚Äì grew from 36 marketwide in 2005 to 48 in 2006 and 41 2007.\\" Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, p. 203 This process was later disparaged as \\"ratings laundering\\"McLean, and Nocera. All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p. 122) or a way of transforming \\"dross into gold\\" by some business journalists, but was justified at the time by the belief that home prices would always rise. The model used by underwriters, rating agencies and investors to estimate the probability of mortgage default was based on the history of credit default swaps, which unfortunately went back \\"less than a decade, a period when house prices soared\\". In addition the model ‚Äì which postulated that the correlation of default risks among loans in securitization pools could be measured in a simple, stable, tractable number, suitable for risk management or valuation ‚Äì also purported to show that the mortgages in CDO pools were well diversified or \\"uncorrelated\\". Defaults on mortgages in Orlando, for example, were thought to have no effect on ‚Äì i.e. were uncorrelated with ‚Äì the real estate market across the country in Laguna Beach. When prices corrected (i.e. the bubble collapsed), the resulting defaults were not only larger in number than predicted but far more correlated. Still another innovative security criticized after the bubble burst was the synthetic CDO. Cheaper and easier to create than original \\"cash\\" CDOs, synthetics did not provide funding for housing, rather synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance (in the form of \\"credit default swaps\\") against mortgage default. The mortgages they insured were those in \\"cash\\" CDOs the synthetics \\"referenced\\". So instead of providing investors with interest and principal payments from MBS tranches, payments were the equivalent of insurance premiums from the insurance \\"buyers\\".credit default swap insurance \\"buyers\\" were known as \\"short investors\\" If the referenced CDOs defaulted, investors lost their investment, which was paid out to the insurance buyers.\\"Unlike the traditional cash CDO, synthetic CDOs contained no actual tranches of mortgage-backed securities ... in the place of real mortgage assets, these CDOs contained credit default swaps and did not finance a single home purchase.\\" (source: The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, 2011, p. 142) Unlike true insurance, credit default swaps were not regulated to insure that providers had the reserves to pay settlements, or that buyers owned the property (MBSs) they were insuring, i.e. were not simply making a bet a security would default. Because synthetics \\"referenced\\" another (cash) CDO, more than one ‚Äì in fact numerous ‚Äì synthetics could be made to reference the same original, multiplying the effect if a referenced security defaulted.McLean, and Nocera. All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p. 263) As with MBS and other CDOs, triple A ratings for \\"large chunks\\"McLean and Nocera. All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p. 265) of synthetics were crucial to the securities' success, because of the buyer/investors' ignorance of the mortgage security market and trust in the credit rating agencies ratings.McLean and Nocera. All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p. 266) Securitization began to take off in the mid-1990s. The total amount of mortgage-backed securities issued almost tripled between 1996 and 2007, to $7.3 trillion. The securitized share of subprime mortgages (i.e., those passed to third-party investors via MBS) increased from 54% in 2001, to 75% in 2006. In the mid-2000s as the housing market was peaking, GSE securitization market share declined dramatically, while higher-risk subprime and Alt-A mortgage private label securitization grew sharply. As mortgage defaults began to rise, it was among mortgages securitized by the private banks. GSE mortgages ‚Äì securitized or not ‚Äì continued to perform better than the rest of the market.Deliquencies among prime, fixed rate mortgages never rose over 5%. Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, p. 217, figure 11.2 Picking up the slack for the dwindling cash CDO market synthetics were the dominant form of CDO's by 2006, valued \\"notionally\\"the total of the underlying debt of synthetics on which investors were betting at an estimated $5 trillion.Zuckerman, Gregory, The Greatest Trade Ever: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of How John Paulson Defied Wall Street and Made Financial History, Broadway Books, 2009, p. 176 By the autumn of 2008, when the securitization market \\"seized up\\" and investors would \\"no longer lend at any price\\", securitized lending made up about $10 trillion of the roughly $25 trillion American credit market, (i.e. what \\"American homeowners, consumers, and corporations owed\\"). In February 2009, Ben Bernanke stated that securitization markets remained effectively shut, with the exception of conforming mortgages, which could be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to economist A. Michael Spence: \\"when formerly uncorrelated risks shift and become highly correlated ... diversification models fail.\\" \\"An important challenge going forward is to better understand these dynamics as the analytical underpinning of an early warning system with respect to financial instability.\\" Criticizing the argument that complex structured investment securitization was instrumental in the mortgage crisis, Paul Krugman points out that the Wall Street firms issuing the securities \\"kept the riskiest assets on their own books\\", and that neither of the equally disastrous bubbles in European housing or US commercial property used complex structured securities. Krugman does agree that it is \\"arguable is that financial innovation ... spread the bust to financial institutions around the world\\" and its inherent fragmentation of loans has made post-bubble \\"cleanup\\" through debt renegotiation extremely difficult. =Financial institution debt levels and incentives= Leverage ratios of investment banks increased significantly between 2003 and 2007. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in January 2011 that: \\"From 1978 to 2007, the amount of debt held by the financial sector soared from $3 trillion to $36 trillion, more than doubling as a share of gross domestic product. The very nature of many Wall Street firms changed ‚Äì from relatively staid private partnerships to publicly traded corporations taking greater and more diverse kinds of risks. By 2005, the 10 largest U.S. commercial banks held 55% of the industry's assets, more than double the level held in 1990. On the eve of the crisis in 2006, financial sector profits constituted 27% of all corporate profits in the United States, up from 15% in 1980.\\" Many financial institutions, investment banks in particular, issued large amounts of debt during 2004‚Äì07, and invested the proceeds in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), essentially betting that house prices would continue to rise, and that households would continue to make their mortgage payments. Borrowing at a lower interest rate and investing the proceeds at a higher interest rate is a form of financial leverage. This is analogous to an individual taking out a second mortgage on his residence to invest in the stock market. This strategy proved profitable during the housing boom, but resulted in large losses when house prices began to decline and mortgages began to default. Beginning in 2007, financial institutions and individual investors holding MBS also suffered significant losses from mortgage payment defaults and the resulting decline in the value of MBS. A 2004 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision related to the net capital rule allowed US investment banks to issue substantially more debt, which was then used to purchase MBS. Over 2004‚Äì07, the top five US investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage (see diagram), which increased their vulnerability to the declining value of MBSs. These five institutions reported over $4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, about 30% of US nominal GDP for 2007. Further, the percentage of subprime mortgages originated to total originations increased from below 10% in 2001‚Äì03 to between 18‚Äì20% from 2004 to 2006, due in-part to financing from investment banks. During 2008, three of the largest U.S. investment banks either went bankrupt (Lehman Brothers) or were sold at fire sale prices to other banks (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch). These failures augmented the instability in the global financial system. The remaining two investment banks, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, opted to become commercial banks, thereby subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation. In the years leading up to the crisis, the top four U.S. depository banks moved an estimated $5.2 trillion in assets and liabilities off-balance sheet into special purpose vehicles or other entities in the shadow banking system. This enabled them to essentially bypass existing regulations regarding minimum capital ratios, thereby increasing leverage and profits during the boom but increasing losses during the crisis. New accounting guidance will require them to put some of these assets back onto their books during 2009, which will significantly reduce their capital ratios. One news agency estimated this amount to be between $500 billion and $1 trillion. This effect was considered as part of the stress tests performed by the government during 2009. Martin Wolf wrote in June 2009: \\"...an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade ‚Äì the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself ‚Äì was to find a way round regulation.\\" The New York State Comptroller's Office has said that in 2006, Wall Street executives took home bonuses totaling $23.9 billion. \\"Wall Street traders were thinking of the bonus at the end of the year, not the long-term health of their firm. The whole system ‚Äì from mortgage brokers to Wall Street risk managers ‚Äì seemed tilted toward taking short-term risks while ignoring long-term obligations. The most damning evidence is that most of the people at the top of the banks didn't really understand how those [investments] worked.\\" The incentive compensation of traders was focused on fees generated from assembling financial products, rather than the performance of those products and profits generated over time. Their bonuses were heavily skewed towards cash rather than stock and not subject to \\"claw-back\\" (recovery of the bonus from the employee by the firm) in the event the MBS or CDO created did not perform. In addition, the increased risk (in the form of financial leverage) taken by the major investment banks was not adequately factored into the compensation of senior executives. =Credit default swaps= Credit default swaps (CDS) are financial instruments used as a hedge and protection for debtholders, in particular MBS investors, from the risk of default, or by speculators to profit from default. As the net worth of banks and other financial institutions deteriorated because of losses related to subprime mortgages, the likelihood increased that those providing the protection would have to pay their counterparties. This created uncertainty across the system, as investors wondered which companies would be required to pay to cover mortgage defaults. Like all swaps and other financial derivatives, CDS may either be used to hedge risks (specifically, to insure creditors against default) or to profit from speculation. The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008, with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts, as of November 2008, ranging from US$33 to $47 trillion.Goel, S., Crisis Management (New Delhi: Global India Publications, 2009), p. 73. CDS are lightly regulated, largely because of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. As of 2008, there was no central clearing house to honor CDS in the event a party to a CDS proved unable to perform his obligations under the CDS contract. Required disclosure of CDS-related obligations has been criticized as inadequate. Insurance companies such as American International Group (AIG), MBIA, and Ambac faced ratings downgrades because widespread mortgage defaults increased their potential exposure to CDS losses. These firms had to obtain additional funds (capital) to offset this exposure. AIG's having CDSs insuring $440 billion of MBS resulted in its seeking and obtaining a Federal government bailout. The monoline insurance companies went out of business in 2008‚Äì2009. When investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September 2008, there was much uncertainty as to which financial firms would be required to honor the CDS contracts on its $600 billion of bonds outstanding. Merrill Lynch's large losses in 2008 were attributed in part to the drop in value of its unhedged portfolio of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) after AIG ceased offering CDS on Merrill's CDOs. The loss of confidence of trading partners in Merrill Lynch's solvency and its ability to refinance its short-term debt led to its acquisition by the Bank of America. Economist Joseph Stiglitz summarized how credit default swaps contributed to the systemic meltdown: \\"With this complicated intertwining of bets of great magnitude, no one could be sure of the financial position of anyone else-or even of one's own position. Not surprisingly, the credit markets froze.\\" Author Michael Lewis wrote that CDS enabled speculators to stack bets on the same mortgage bonds and CDO's. This is analogous to allowing many persons to buy insurance on the same house. Speculators that bought CDS insurance were betting that significant defaults would occur, while the sellers (such as AIG) bet they would not. A theoretically infinite amount could be wagered on the same housing-related securities, provided buyers and sellers of the CDS could be found. Derivatives such as CDS were unregulated or barely regulated. Several sources have noted the failure of the US government to supervise or even require transparency of the financial instruments known as derivatives.The Warning Frontline A 2008 investigative article in the Washington Post found that leading government officials at the time (Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt) vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives. In 1998 Brooksley E. Born, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, put forth a policy paper asking for feedback from regulators, lobbyists, legislators on the question of whether derivatives should be reported, sold through a central facility, or whether capital requirements should be required of their buyers. Greenspan, Rubin, and Levitt pressured her to withdraw the paper and Greenspan persuaded Congress to pass a resolution preventing CFTC from regulating derivatives for another six months ‚Äì when Born's term of office would expire.McLean, Bethany and Joe Nocera, All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis Portfolio, Penguin, 2010, pp. 104‚Äì07 Ultimately, it was the collapse of a specific kind of derivative, the mortgage-backed security, that triggered the economic crisis of 2008. In addition, Chicago Public Radio, Huffington Post, and ProPublica reported in April 2010 that market participants, including a hedge fund called Magnetar Capital, encouraged the creation of CDO's containing low quality mortgages, so they could bet against them using CDS. NPR reported that Magnetar encouraged investors to purchase CDO's while simultaneously betting against them, without disclosing the latter bet. Instruments called synthetic CDO, which are portfolios of credit default swaps, were also involved in allegations by the SEC against Goldman-Sachs in April 2010. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in January 2011 that CDS contributed significantly to the crisis. Companies were able to sell protection to investors against the default of mortgage-backed securities, helping to launch and expand the market for new, complex instruments such as CDO's. This further fueled the housing bubble. They also amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread these bets throughout the financial system. Companies selling protection, such as AIG, were not required to set aside sufficient capital to cover their obligations when significant defaults occurred. Because many CDS were not traded on exchanges, the obligations of key financial institutions became hard to measure, creating uncertainty in the financial system. =Inaccurate credit ratings= MBS credit rating downgrades, by quarter Credit rating agencies ‚Äì firms which rate debt instruments/securities according to the debtor's ability to pay lenders back ‚Äì have come under scrutiny during and after the financial crisis for having given investment-grade ratings to MBSs and CDOs based on risky subprime mortgage loans that later defaulted. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by investors against the \\"Big Three\\" rating agencies ‚Äì Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch Ratings. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)the ten-member commission appointed by the United States government with the goal of investigating the causes of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 concluded the \\"failures\\" of the Big Three rating agencies were \\"essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction\\" and \\"key enablers of the financial meltdown\\".Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Final Report- Conclusions, January 2011 Economist Joseph Stiglitz called them \\"one of the key culprits\\" of the financial crisis.Ratings agencies suffer 'conflict of interest', says former Moody's boss Rupert Neate The Guardian 22 August 2011 Others called their ratings \\"catastrophically misleading\\", (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner), their performance \\"horrendous\\" (The Economist magazine). There are indications that some involved in rating subprime-related securities knew at the time that the rating process was faulty. The position of the three agencies \\"between the issuers and the investors of securities\\" \\"transformed\\" them into \\"key\\" players in the housing bubble and financial crisis according to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report. Most investors in the fixed income market had no experience with the mortgage business ‚Äì let alone dealing with the complexity of pools of mortgages and tranche priority of MBS and CDO securities ‚Äì and were simply looking for an independent party who could rate securities. The putatively independent parties meanwhile were paid \\"handsome fees\\" by investment banks \\"to obtain the desired ratings\\", according to one expert. In addition, a large section of the debt securities market ‚Äì many money markets and pension funds ‚Äì were restricted in their bylaws to holding only the safest securities ‚Äì i.e securities the rating agencies designated \\"triple-A\\". Hence non-prime securities could not be sold without ratings by (usually two of) the three agencies.McLean, Bethany and Joe Nocera. All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis, Portfolio, Penguin, 2010 (p. 111) From 2000 to 2007, one of the largest agencies ‚Äì Moody's ‚Äì rated nearly 45,000 mortgage- related securities ‚Äì more than half of those it rated ‚Äì as triple-A. By December 2008, there were over $11 trillion structured finance securities outstanding in the U.S. bond market debt. But as the boom matured, mortgage underwriting standards deteriorated. By 2007 an estimated $3.2 trillion in loans were made to homebuyers and owners with bad credit and undocumented incomes, bundled into MBSs and CDOs, and given top ratings to appeal to global investors. As these mortgages began to default, the three agencies were compelled to go back and redo their ratings. Between autumn of 2007 and the middle of 2008, agencies downgraded nearly $2 trillion in MBS tranches. By the end of 2008, 80% of the CDOs by valueworth $300 billion rated \\"triple-A\\" were downgraded to junk.)Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States, p. 229, figure 11.4 Bank writedowns and losses on these investments totaled $523 billion.Bloomberg-Smith-Bringing Down Ratings Let Loose Subprime Scourge  By Elliot Blair Smith  bloomberg.com September 24, 2008Bloomberg-Smith-Race to Bottom at Rating Agencies Secured Subprime Boom, Bust  By Elliot Blair Smith  bloomberg.com September 25, 2008 Critics such as the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission argue the mistaken credit ratings stemmed from \\"flawed computer models, the pressure from financial firms that paid for the ratings, the relentless drive for market share, the lack of resources to do the job despite record profits, and the absence of meaningful public oversight\\". Structured investment was very profitable to the agencies and by 2007 accounted for just under half of Moody's total ratings revenue and all of the revenue growth.McLean, and Nocera. All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p. 124) But profits were not guaranteed, and issuers played the agencies off one another, 'shopping' around to find the best ratings, sometimes openly threatening to cut off business after insufficiently generous ratings. Thus there was a conflict of interest between accommodating clients ‚Äì for whom higher ratings meant higher earnings ‚Äì and accurately rating the debt for the benefit of the debt buyer/investors ‚Äì who provided zero revenue to the agencies. Despite the profitability of the three big credit agencies ‚Äì Moody's operating margins were consistently over 50%, higher than famously successful Exxon Mobil or MicrosoftMcLean, Bethany and Joe Nocera, All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis Portfolio, Penguin, 2010 (p. 124) ‚Äì salaries and bonuses for non-management were significantly lower than at Wall Street banks, and its employees complained of overwork. This incentivized agency rating analysts to seek employment at those Wall Street banks who were issuing mortgage securities, and who were particularly interested in the analysts' knowledge of what criteria their former employers used to rate securities.see also Inside knowledge of interest to security issuers eager to find loopholes included the fact that rating agencies looked at the average credit score of a pool of borrowers, but not how dispersed it was; that agencies ignored borrower's household income or length of credit history (explaining the large numbers of low income immigrants given mortgages‚Äîpeople \\"who had never failed to repay a debt, because they had never been given a loan\\"); that agencies were indifferent to credit worthiness issues of adjustable-rate mortgages with low teaser rates, \\"silent second\\" mortgages, or no-documentation mortgages. As of 2010, virtually all of the investigations of rating agencies, criminal as well as civil, are in their early stages. In New York, state prosecutors are examining whether eight banksGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Cr√©dit Agricole and Merrill Lynch, duped the credit ratings agencies into inflating the grades of subprime-linked investments. In the dozens of suits filed against them by investors involving claims of inaccurate ratings the rating agencies have defended themselves using the First Amendment defense‚Äîthat a credit rating is an opinion protected as free speech. In 2013, McClatchy Newspapers found that \\"little competition has emerged\\" since the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 was passed \\"in rating the kinds of complex home-mortgage securities whose implosion led to the 2007 financial crisis\\". The Big Three's market share of outstanding credit rating has barely shrunk, moving from 98% to 97%. Governmental policies U.S. Subprime lending expanded dramatically 2004‚Äì2006. Government over- regulation, failed regulation and deregulation have all been claimed as causes of the crisis. Increasing home ownership has been the goal of several presidents including Roosevelt, Reagan, Clinton and George W. Bush.Whitehouse- President Hosts Conference on Minority Home Ownership, October 15, 2002 =Decreased regulation of financial institutions= Several steps were taken to reduce the regulation applied to banking institutions in the years leading up to the crisis. Further, major investment banks which collapsed during the crisis were not subject to the regulations applied to depository banks. In testimony before Congress both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Alan Greenspan claimed failure in allowing the self- regulation of investment banks. In 1982, Congress passed the Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act (AMTPA), which allowed non-federally chartered housing creditors to write adjustable-rate mortgages. This bi- partisan legislation was, according to the Urban Institute, intended to \\"increase the volume of loan products that reduced the up-front costs to borrowers in order to make homeownership more affordable.\\"Kenneth Temkin and Jennifer Johnson and Diane Levy, \\"Subprime Markets, the Role of GSEs and Risk- Based Pricing,\\" (Washington, DC: Urban Institute, March 2002), 8. Among the new mortgage loan types created and gaining in popularity in the early 1980s were adjustable-rate, option adjustable-rate, balloon-payment and interest- only mortgages. Subsequent widespread abuses of predatory lending occurred with the use of adjustable-rate mortgages. Approximately 90% of subprime mortgages issued in 2006 were adjustable-rate mortgages. The Glass-Steagall Act was enacted after the Great Depression. It separated commercial banks and investment banks, in part to avoid potential conflicts of interest between the lending activities of the former and rating activities of the latter. In 1999 Glass-Steagall was repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Economist Joseph Stiglitz criticized the repeal of Glass Steagall because, in his opinion, it enabled the risk-taking culture of investment banking to dominate the more conservative commercial banking culture, leading to increased levels of risk- taking and leverage during the boom period. President Bill Clinton, who signed the legislation, dismissed its connection to the subprime mortgage crisis, stating (in 2008): \\"I don't see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis.\\"Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), pp.289‚Äì90. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 was bi-partisan legislation that formally exempted derivatives from regulation, supervision, trading on established exchanges, and capital reserve requirements for major participants. It \\"provided a legal safe harbor for treatment already in effect.\\"Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), p. 218. Concerns that counterparties to derivative deals would be unable to pay their obligations caused pervasive uncertainty during the crisis. Particularly relevant to the crisis are credit default swaps (CDS), a derivative in which Party A pays Party B what is essentially an insurance premium, in exchange for payment should Party C default on its obligations. Warren Buffett famously referred to derivatives as \\"financial weapons of mass destruction\\" in early 2003. Former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, who many economists blamed for the financial crisis, testified in October 2008 that he had trusted free markets to self-correct and had not anticipated the risk of reduced lending standards.\\"Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders' equity, myself included, are in a state of shocked disbelief.\\" Some analysts believe the subprime mortgage crisis was due, in part, to a 2004 decision of the SEC that affected 5 large investment banks. The critics believe that changes in the capital reserve calculation rules enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on, fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages. These banks dramatically increased their risk taking from 2003 to 2007. By the end of 2007, the largest five U.S. investment banks had over $4 trillion in debt with high ratios of debt to equity, meaning only a small decline in the value of their assets would render them insolvent. However, in an April 9, 2009 speech, Erik Sirri, then Director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets, argued that the regulatory weaknesses in leverage restrictions originated in the late 1970s: \\"The Commission did not undo any leverage restrictions in 2004,\\" nor did it intend to make a substantial reduction.Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), p. 258. =Policies to promote affordable housing= Several administrations, both Democratic and Republican, advocated affordable housing policies in the years leading up to the crisis. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 established, for the first time, an affordable housing loan purchase mandate for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a mandate to be regulated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Initially, the 1992 legislation required that 30 percent or more of Fannie's and Freddie's loan purchases be related to affordable housing. However, HUD was given the power to set future requirements. During the later part of the Clinton Administration, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo announced \\"new regulations to provide $2.4 trillion in mortgages for affordable housing for 28.1 million families, which increased the required percentage of mortgage loans for low- and moderate-income families that finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must buy annually from the then current 42 percent of their total purchases to a new high of 50 percent. Eventually (under the Bush Administration) a 56 percent minimum was established. Additionally, in 2003, \\"The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago.\\". \\"The National Homeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream\\", was compiled in 1995 by Henry Cisneros, President Clinton's HUD Secretary. This 100-page document represented the viewpoints of HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, leaders of the housing industry, various banks, numerous activist organizations such as ACORN and La Raza, and representatives from several state and local governments.\\"Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 9. In 2001, the independent research company, Graham Fisher & Company, stated: \\"While the underlying initiatives of the [strategy] were broad in content, the main theme ‚Ä¶ was the relaxation of credit standards.\\" The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (majority report), Federal Reserve economists, and several academic researchers have stated that government affordable housing policies were not the major cause of the financial crisis. They also state that Community Reinvestment Act loans outperformed other \\"subprime\\" mortgages, and GSE mortgages performed better than private label securitizations. Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) was originally enacted under President Jimmy Carter in 1977 in an effort to encourage banks to halt the practice of lending discrimination.Berry, M., & Romero, J., \\"Community Reinvestment Act of 1977\\", federalreservehistory.org. In 1995 the Clinton Administration issued regulations that added numerical guidelines, urged lending flexibility, and instructed bank examiners to evaluate a bank's responsiveness to community activists (such as ACORN) when deciding whether to approve bank merger or expansion requests. Critics claim that the 1995 changes to CRA signaled to banks that relaxed lending standards were appropriate and could minimize potential risk of governmental sanctions. Conservatives and libertarians have debated the possible effects of the CRA, with detractors claiming that the Act encouraged lending to uncreditworthy borrowers,Thomas J. DiLorenzo, The Government-Created Subprime Mortgage Meltdown, LewRockwell.com, September 6, 2007 accessdate=2007-12-07 and defenders claiming a thirty-year history of lending without increased risk. Detractors also claim that amendments to the CRA in the mid-1990s raised the number of mortgages issued to otherwise unqualified low-income borrowers, and allowed the securitization of CRA- regulated mortgages, even though a fair number of them were subprime. In its \\"Conclusions\\" submitted January 2011, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported that > \\"the CRA was not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis. > Many subprime lenders were not subject to the CRA. Research indicates only > 6% of high-cost loans‚Äîa proxy for subprime loans‚Äîhad any connection to the > law. Loans made by CRA-regulated lenders in the neighborhoods in which they > were required to lend were half as likely to default as similar loans made > in the same neighborhoods by independent mortgage originators not subject to > the law.\\" Critics claim that the use of the high-interest-rate proxy distorts results because government programs generally promote low-interest rate loans‚Äîeven when the loans are to borrowers who are clearly subprime.Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), p. 141. However, several economists maintain that Community Reinvestment Act loans outperformed other \\"subprime\\" mortgages, and GSE mortgages performed better than private label securitizations. However, economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) concluded that banks undergoing CRA-related regulatory exams took additional mortgage lending risk. The authors of a study entitled \\"Did the Community Reinvestment Act Lead to Risky Lending?\\" compared \\"the lending behavior of banks undergoing CRA exams within a given census tract in a given month (the treatment group) to the behavior of banks operating in the same census tract-month that did not face these exams (the control group). This comparison clearly indicates that adherence to the CRA led to riskier lending by banks.\\" They concluded: \\"The evidence shows that around CRA examinations, when incentives to conform to CRA standards are particularly high, banks not only increase lending rates but also appear to originate loans that are markedly riskier.\\" Loan delinquency averaged 15% higher in the treatment group than the control group one year after mortgage origination. =State and local governmental programs= As part of the 1995 National Homeownership Strategy, HUD advocated greater involvement of state and local organizations in the promotion of affordable housing.United States. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, The National Homeownership Strategy : Partners in the American Dream (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, 1995), 1‚Äì1. In addition, it promoted the use of low or no-down payment loans and second, unsecured loans to the borrower to pay their down payments (if any) and closing costs.Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), pp. 11‚Äì12. This idea manifested itself in \\"silent second\\" loans that became extremely popular in several states such as California, and in scores of cities such as San Francisco.Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), p. 47. Using federal funds and their own funds, these states and cities offered borrowers loans that would defray the cost of the down payment. The loans were called \\"silent\\" because the primary lender was not supposed to know about them. A Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (affiliated with HUD) publicity sheet explicitly described the desired secrecy: \\"[The NRC affiliates] hold the second mortgages. Instead of going to the family, the monthly voucher is paid to [the NRC affiliates]. In this way the voucher is \\"invisible\\" to the traditional lender and the family (emphasis added) Role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Franklin Raines earned $90 million in salary and bonuses while he was head of Fannie Mae.\\"Key Figures in the Financial Crisis\\". BusinessWeek. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored enterprises (GSE) that purchase mortgages, buy and sell mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and guarantee nearly half of the mortgages in the U.S. A variety of political and competitive pressures resulted in the GSEs ramping up their purchase and guarantee of risky mortgages in 2005 and 2006, just as the housing market was peaking. Fannie and Freddie were both under political pressure to expand purchases of higher-risk affordable housing mortgage types, and under significant competitive pressure from large investment banks and mortgage lenders. As early as February 2004, in testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Alan Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve) raised serious concerns regarding the systemic financial risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac represented. He implored Congress to take actions to avert a crisis. The GSEs dispute these studies and dismissed Greenspan's testimony. Nine of the ten members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in 2011 that Fannie and Freddie \\"contributed to the crisis, but were not a primary cause\\", or that since \\"credit spreads declined not just for housing, but also for other asset classes like commercial real estate ... problems with U.S. housing policy or markets [could] not by themselves explain the U.S. housing bubble.\\" According to the Commission, GSE mortgage securities essentially maintained their value throughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses that were central to the financial crisis. The GSEs participated in the expansion of subprime and other risky mortgages, but they followed rather than led Wall Street and other lenders into subprime lending. Several studies by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and several academic institutions summarized by economist Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute, indicate Fannie and Freddie were not to blame for the crisis. A 2011 statistical comparisons of regions of the US which were subject to GSE regulations with regions that were not, done by the Federal Reserve, found that GSEs played no significant role in the subprime crisis. In 2008, David Goldstein and Kevin G. Hall reported that more than 84 percent of the subprime mortgages came from private lending institutions in 2006, and the share of subprime loans insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac decreased as the bubble got bigger (from a high of insuring 48 percent to insuring 24 percent of all subprime loans in 2006).\\"Private sector loans, not Fannie or Freddie, triggered crisis\\" McClatchy Newspapers 2008/10/12 In 2008, another source found estimates by some analysts that Fannie's share of the subprime mortgage-backed securities market dropped from a peak of 44% in 2003 to 22% in 2005, before rising to 33% in 2007. Whether GSEs played a small role in the crisis because they were legally barred from engaging in subprime lending is disputed. Economist Russell Roberts cites a June 2008 Washington Post article which stated that \\"[f]rom 2004 to 2006, the two [GSEs] purchased $434 billion in securities backed by subprime loans, creating a market for more such lending.\\" Furthermore, a 2004 HUD report admitted that while trading securities that were backed by subprime mortgages was something that the GSEs officially disavowed, they nevertheless participated in the market. pp. 46, 108‚Äì10 Insofar as Fannie and Freddie did purchase substandard loans, some analysts question whether government mandates for affordable housing were the motivation. In December 2011 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the former Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives, accusing them of misleading investors about risks of subprime- mortgage loans and about the amount of subprime mortgage loans they held in portfolio. According to one analyst, \\"The SEC's facts paint a picture in which it wasn't high-minded government mandates that did the GSEs wrong, but rather the monomaniacal focus of top management on marketshare. With marketshare came bonuses and with bonuses came risk-taking, understood or not.\\" However, there is evidence suggesting that governmental housing policies were a motivational factor. Daniel H. Mudd, the former CEO of Fannie Mae, stated: \\"We were afraid that lenders would be selling products we weren't buying and Congress would feel like we weren't fulfilling our mission.\\" Another senior Fannie Mae executive stated: \\"Everybody understood that we were now buying loans that we would have previously rejected, and that the models were telling us that we were charging way too little, but our mandate was to stay relevant and to serve low-income borrowers. So that's what we did.\\" In his lone dissent to the majority and minority opinions of the FCIC, Peter J. Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) blamed U.S. housing policy, including the actions of Fannie and Freddie, primarily for the crisis, writing: \\"When the bubble began to deflate in mid-2007, the low quality and high risk loans engendered by government policies failed in unprecedented numbers. The effect of these defaults was exacerbated by the fact that few if any investors ‚Äì including housing market analysts ‚Äì understood at the time that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been acquiring large numbers of subprime and other high risk loans in order to meet HUD's affordable housing goals.\\" His dissent relied heavily on the research of fellow AEI member Edward Pinto, the former Chief Credit Officer of Fannie Mae. Pinto estimated that by early 2008 there were 27 million higher-risk, \\"non-traditional\\" mortgages (defined as subprime and Alt-A) outstanding valued at $4.6 trillion. Of these, Fannie & Freddie held or guaranteed 12 million mortgages valued at $1.8 trillion. Government entities held or guaranteed 19.2 million or $2.7 trillion of such mortgages total. One counter-argument to Wallison and Pinto's analysis is that the credit bubble was global and also affected the U.S. commercial real estate market, a scope beyond U.S. government housing policy pressures. The three Republican authors of the dissenting report to the FCIC majority opinion wrote in January 2011: \\"Credit spreads declined not just for housing, but also for other asset classes like commercial real estate. This tells us to look to the credit bubble as an essential cause of the U.S. housing bubble. It also tells us that problems with U.S. housing policy or markets do not by themselves explain the U.S. housing bubble.\\" Economist Paul Krugman wrote in January 2010 that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, CRA, or predatory lending were not primary causes of the bubble/bust in residential real estate because there was a bubble of similar magnitude in commercial real estate in America. Countering the analysis of Krugman and members of the FCIC, Peter Wallison argues that the crisis was caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble that was supported largely by low or no-down-payment loans, which was uniquely the case for U.S. residential housing loans. He states: \\"It is not true that every bubble ‚Äì even a large bubble ‚Äì has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates.\\" As an example, Wallison notes that other developed countries had \\"large bubbles during the 1997‚Äì2007 period\\" but \\"the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997‚Äì2007 [bubble] deflated.\\"Peter J. Wallison, \\"Dissent from the Majority Report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,\\" (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, January 2011), p. 18, www.aei.org. Other analysis calls into question the validity of comparing the residential loan crisis to the commercial loan crisis. After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis, Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported (in December 2010): \\"We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS [commercial mortgage-backed securities] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis.\\"Sanders, Anthony B. and An, Xudong, Default of CMBS Loans During the Crisis (November 29, 2010). 46th Annual AREUEA Conference Paper. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1717062 Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate. Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo wrote \\"The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006. Three years later, commercial real estate started feeling the effects.\\"Amadeo, Kimberly, \\"Commercial Real Estate Lending\\" in News & Issues ‚Äì US Economy (About.com, November 2013), http://useconomy.about.com/od/grossdomesticproduct/tp/Commercial-Real-Estate- Loan-Defaults.htm Denice A. Gierach, a real estate attorney and CPA, wrote: > ...most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a > really bad economy. In other words, the borrowers did not cause the loans to > go bad, it was the economy.Gierach, Denice A., \\"Waiting for the other shoe > to drop in commercial real estate\\", (Chicago, IL, The Business Ledger, March > 4, 2010) A second counter-argument to Wallison's dissent is that the definition of \\"non-traditional mortgages\\" used in Pinto's analysis overstated the number of risky mortgages in the system by including Alt-A, which was not necessarily high-risk. Krugman explained in July 2011 that the data provided by Pinto significantly overstated the number of subprime loans, citing the work of economist Mike Konczal: \\"As Konczal says, all of this stuff relies on a form of three-card monte: you talk about 'subprime and other high-risk' loans, lumping subprime with other loans that are not, it turns out, anywhere near as risky as actual subprime; then use this essentially fake aggregate to make it seem as if Fannie/Freddie were actually at the core of the problem.\\" Other contributing factorsPolicies of central banks= Federal funds rate and various mortgage rates Central banks manage monetary policy and may target the rate of inflation. They have some authority over commercial banks and possibly other financial institutions. They are less concerned with avoiding asset price bubbles, such as the housing bubble and dot-com bubble. Central banks have generally chosen to react after such bubbles burst so as to minimize collateral damage to the economy, rather than trying to prevent or stop the bubble itself. This is because identifying an asset bubble and determining the proper monetary policy to deflate it are matters of debate among economists. Some market observers have been concerned that Federal Reserve actions could give rise to moral hazard. A Government Accountability Office critic said that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's rescue of Long- Term Capital Management in 1998 would encourage large financial institutions to believe that the Federal Reserve would intervene on their behalf if risky loans went sour because they were \\"too big to fail.\\" A contributing factor to the rise in house prices was the Federal Reserve's lowering of interest rates early in the decade. From 2000 to 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5% to 1.0%. This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and of the September 2001 terrorist attacks, and to combat the perceived risk of deflation. The Fed believed that interest rates could be lowered safely primarily because the rate of inflation was low; it disregarded other important factors. According to Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the Fed's interest rate policy during the early 2000s (decade) was misguided, because measured inflation in those years was below true inflation, which led to a monetary policy that contributed to the housing bubble. Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan ‚Äî both former chairmen of the Federal Reserve ‚Äî disagree, arguing decisions on purchasing a home depends on long-term interest rates on mortgages not the short-term rates controlled by the Fed. According to Greenspan, \\"between 1971 and 2002, the fed funds rate and the mortgage rate moved in lock-step,\\" but when the Fed started to raise rates in 2004, mortgage rates diverged, continuing to fall (or at least not rise) for another year (see \\"Fed Funds Rate & Mortgage Rates\\" graph). Construction of new homes didn't peak until January 2006. Bernanke speculates that a world wide \\"saving glut\\" pushed capital or savings into the United States, keeping long-term interest rates low and independent of Central Bank action. Agreeing with Fisher that the low interest rate policy of the Greenspan Fed both allowed and motivated investors to seek out risk investments offering higher returns, is finance economist Raghuram Rajan who argues that the underlying causes of the American economy's tendency to go \\"from bubble to bubble\\" fueled by unsustainable monetary stimulation, are the \\"weak safety nets\\" for the unemployed, which made \\"the US political system ... acutely sensitive to job growth\\"; and attempts to compensate for the stagnant income of the middle and lower classes with easy credit to boost their consumption. Economist Thomas Sowell wrote that the Fed's decision to steadily raise interest rates was a key factor that ended the housing bubble. The Fed raised rates from the unusually low level of one percent in 2004 to a more typical 5.25% in 2006. By driving mortgage rates higher, the Fed \\"made monthly mortgage payments more expensive and therefore reduced the demand for housing.\\" He referred to the Fed action as the \\"nudge\\" that collapsed the \\"house of cards\\" created by lax lending standards, affordable housing policies, and the preceding period of low interest rates. =Mark-to-market accounting rule= Former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair William Isaac placed much of the blame for the subprime mortgage crisis on the Securities and Exchange Commission and its fair-value accounting rules, especially the requirement for banks to mark their assets to market, particularly mortgage-backed securities.\\"Former FDIC Chair Blames SEC for Credit Crunch\\", CNBC, October 9, 2008. Retrieved Jan 25, 2010 Whether or not this is true has been the subject of ongoing debate.Fair value: the pragmatic solution, Fortune, November 21, 2008. Retrieved Jan 25, 2010Forbes, Steve. \\"Obama Repeats Bush's Worst Market Mistakes\\" The Wall Street Journal. March 6, 2009. Retrieved June 13, 2009 The debate arises because this accounting rule requires companies to adjust the value of marketable securities (such as the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the center of the crisis) to their market value. The intent of the standard is to help investors understand the value of these assets at a point in time, rather than just their historical purchase price. Because the market for these assets is distressed, it is difficult to sell many MBS at other than prices which may (or may not) be reflective of market stresses, which may be below the value that the mortgage cash flow related to the MBS would merit. As initially interpreted by companies and their auditors, the typically lower sale value was used as the market value rather than the cash flow value. Many large financial institutions recognized significant losses during 2007 and 2008 as a result of marking-down MBS asset prices to market value.Welfens, P. J. J., Innovations in Macroeconomics (Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer, 2006), p. 448. =Globalization, technology and the trade deficit= U.S. current account or trade deficit through 2012 In 2005, Ben Bernanke addressed the implications of the United States's high and rising current account deficit, resulting from U.S. investment exceeding its savings, or imports exceeding exports. Between 1996 and 2004, the U.S. current account deficit increased by $650 billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. The U.S. attracted a great deal of foreign investment, mainly from the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The balance of payments identity requires that a country (such as the U.S.) running a current account deficit also have a capital account (investment) surplus of the same amount. Foreign investors had these funds to lend, either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China), or because of high oil prices. Bernanke referred to this as a \\"saving glut\\" that may have pushed capital into the United States, a view differing from that of some other economists, who view such capital as having been pulled into the U.S. by its high consumption levels. In other words, a nation cannot consume more than its income unless it sells assets to foreigners, or foreigners are willing to lend to it. Alternatively, if a nation wishes to increase domestic investment in plant and equipment, it will also increase its level of imports to maintain balance if it has a floating exchange rate. Regardless of the push or pull view, a \\"flood\\" of funds (capital or liquidity) reached the U.S. financial market. Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct impact of the crisis. American households, on the other hand, used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. Financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgage-backed securities. American housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst. Economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in October 2011 that the recession and high unemployment of the 2009‚Äì2011 period was years in the making and driven by: unsustainable consumption; high manufacturing productivity outpacing demand thereby increasing unemployment; income inequality that shifted income from those who tended to spend it (i.e., the middle class) to those who do not (i.e., the wealthy); and emerging market's buildup of reserves (to the tune of $7.6 trillion by 2011) which was not spent. These factors all led to a \\"massive\\" shortfall in aggregate demand, which was \\"papered over\\" by demand related to the housing bubble until it burst. Subprime mortgage crisis phases=January 2007 to March 2008 Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis. Financial market stresses became apparent during 2007 that resulted in sizable losses across the financial system, the bankruptcy of over 100 mortgage lenders and the emergency sale of investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008 to depository bank JP Morgan Chase. Some writers began calling the events in the financial markets during this period the \\"Subprime Mortgage Crisis\\" or the \\"Mortgage crisis\\". As U.S. housing prices began to fall from their 2006 peak, global investors became less willing to invest in mortgage- backed securities (MBS). The crisis began to affect the financial sector in February 2007, when HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, wrote down its holdings of subprime-related mortgage securities by $10.5 billion, the first major subprime related loss to be reported. By April 2007, over 50 mortgage companies had declared bankruptcy, many of which had specialized in subprime mortgages, the largest of which was New Century Financial. At least 100 mortgage companies either shut down, suspended operations or were sold during 2007. These mortgage companies made money on the origination and sale of mortgages, rather than interest from holding the mortgage. They had relied on continuing access to this global pool of investor capital to continue their operations; when investor capital dried-up, they were forced into bankruptcy. Other parts of the shadow banking system also encountered difficulty. Legal entities known as structured investment vehicles (SIV) and hedge funds had borrowed from investors and bought MBS. When mortgage defaults rose along with the fall in housing prices, the value of the MBS declined. Investors demanded that these entities put up additional collateral or be forced to pay back the investors immediately, a form of margin call. This resulted in further sales of MBS, which lowered MBS prices further. This dynamic of margin call and price reductions contributed to the collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge funds in July 2007, an event which economist Mark Zandi referred to as \\"arguably the proximate catalyst\\" of the crisis in financial markets. On August 9, 2007 French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was halting redemptions on three investment funds due to subprime problems, another \\"beginning point\\" of the crisis to some observers. Investment banks such as Bear Stearns had legal obligations to provide financial support to these entities, which created a cash drain. Bear Stearns reported the first quarterly loss in its history during November 2007 and obtained additional financing from a Chinese sovereign wealth fund. Investment banks Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley had also obtained additional capital from sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East during late 2007. The major investment banks had also increased their own borrowing and investing as the bubble expanded, taking on additional risk in the search for profit. For example, as of November 30, 2006, Bear Stearns reported $383.6 billion in liabilities and $11.8 billion in equity, a leverage ratio of approximately 33. This high leverage ratio meant that only a 3% reduction in the value of its assets would render it insolvent. Unable to withstand the combination of high leverage, reduced access to capital, loss in the value of its MBS securities portfolio, and claims from its hedge funds, Bear Stearns collapsed during March 2008. Historian Robin Blackburn wrote: \\"The Wall Street investment banks and brokerages hemorrhaged $175 billion of capital in the period July 2007 to March 2008, and Bear Stearns, the fifth largest, was 'rescued' in March, at a fire-sale price, by JP Morgan Chase with the help of $29 billion of guarantees from the Federal Reserve.\\" April to December 2008 The TED spread (the difference between the interest rates on interbank loans and on the safer short-term U.S. government debt) ‚Äì an indicator of credit risk ‚Äì increased dramatically during September 2008. Financial market conditions continued to worsen during 2008. By August 2008, financial firms around the globe had written down their holdings of subprime related securities by US$501 billion. The IMF estimated that financial institutions around the globe would eventually have to write off $1.5 trillion of their holdings of subprime MBSs. About $750 billion in such losses had been recognized as of November 2008. These losses wiped out much of the capital of the world banking system. Banks headquartered in nations that have signed the Basel Accords must have so many cents of capital for every dollar of credit extended to consumers and businesses. Thus the massive reduction in bank capital just described has reduced the credit available to businesses and households. The crisis hit a critical point in September 2008 with the failure, buyout or bailout of the largest entities in the U.S. shadow banking system. Investment bank Lehman Brothers failed, while Merrill Lynch was purchased by Bank of America. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley obtained depository bank holding charters, which gave them access to emergency lines of credit from the Federal Reserve. Government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the federal government. Insurance giant AIG, which had sold insurance-like protection for mortgage-backed securities, did not have the capital to honor its commitments; U.S. taxpayers covered its obligations instead in a bailout that exceeded $100 billion. Further, there was the equivalent of a bank run on other parts of the shadow system, which severely disrupted the ability of non-financial institutions to obtain the funds to run their daily operations. During a one- week period in September 2008, $170 billion were withdrawn from US money funds, causing the Federal Reserve to announce that it would guarantee these funds up to a point. The money market had been a key source of credit for banks (CDs) and nonfinancial firms (commercial paper). The TED spread (see graph above), a measure of the risk of interbank lending, quadrupled shortly after the Lehman failure. This credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse. In a dramatic meeting on September 18, 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke met with key legislators to propose a $700 billion emergency bailout of the banking system. Bernanke reportedly told them: \\"If we don't do this, we may not have an economy on Monday.\\" The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, also called the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), was signed into law on October 3, 2008.Raum, Tom (October 3, 2008) Bush signs $700 billion bailout bill . NPR In a nine-day period from Oct. 1‚Äì9, the S&P; 500 fell a staggering 251 points, losing 21.6% of its value. The week of Oct. 6‚Äì10 saw the largest percentage drop in the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ‚Äì even worse than any single week in the Great Depression. The response of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and other central banks was dramatic. During the last quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history. The governments of European nations and the US also raised the capital of their national banking systems by $1.5 trillion, by purchasing newly issued preferred stock in their major banks. On Dec. 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve cut the Federal funds rate to 0‚Äì0.25%, where it remained until December 2015; this period of zero interest-rate policy was unprecedented in U.S. history.Historical Changes of the Target Federal Funds and Discount Rates from the New York Federal Reserve Branch.

Impacts The International Monetary Fund estimated that large U.S. and European banks lost more than $1 trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from January 2007 to September 2009. These losses were expected to top $2.8 trillion from 2007 to 2010. U.S. banks losses were forecast to hit $1 trillion and European bank losses will reach $1.6 trillion. The IMF estimated that U.S. banks were about 60 percent through their losses, but British and eurozone banks only 40 percent. Impact in the U.S. Impacts from the crisis on key wealth measures U.S. Real GDP ‚Äì Contributions to percent change by component 2007‚Äì2009 Between June 2007 and November 2008, Americans lost more than a quarter of their net worth. By early November 2008, a broad U.S. stock index, the S&P; 500, was down 45 percent from its 2007 high. Housing prices had dropped 20% from their 2006 peak, with futures markets signaling a 30‚Äì35% potential drop. Total home equity in the United States, which was valued at $13 trillion at its peak in 2006, had dropped to $8.8 trillion by mid-2008 and was still falling in late 2008. Total retirement assets, Americans' second-largest household asset, dropped by 22 percent, from $10.3 trillion in 2006 to $8 trillion in mid-2008. During the same period, savings and investment assets (apart from retirement savings) lost $1.2 trillion and pension assets lost $1.3 trillion. Taken together, these losses total $8.3 trillion. * Real gross domestic product (GDP) began contracting in the third quarter of 2008 and did not return to growth until Q1 2010. CBO estimated in February 2013 that real U.S. GDP remained 5.5% below its potential level, or about $850 billion. CBO projected that GDP would not return to its potential level until 2017. * The unemployment rate rose from 5% in 2008 pre-crisis to 10% by late 2009, then steadily declined to 7.6% by March 2013.

Martin Wolf and Paul Krugman argued that the rise in private savings and decline in investment fueled a large private sector surplus, which drove sizable budget deficits.Wolf, M., \\"What really went wrong in the 2008 financial crisis?\\", Financial Times, July 17, 2018.

Impact on Europe Public debt to GDP ratio for selected European countries ‚Äì 2008 to 2012. Source Data: Eurostat Relationship between fiscal tightening (austerity) in Eurozone countries with their GDP growth rate, 2008‚Äì2012Martin Wolf (April 27, 2012) \\"The impact of fiscal austerity in the eurozone\\" Financial Times The crisis in Europe generally progressed from banking system crises to sovereign debt crises, as many countries elected to bail out their banking systems using taxpayer money. Greece was different in that it concealed large public debts in addition to issues within its banking system. Several countries received bailout packages from the \\"troika\\" (European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund), which also implemented a series of emergency measures. Many European countries embarked on austerity programs, reducing their budget deficits relative to GDP from 2010 to 2011. For example, according to the CIA World Factbook Greece improved its budget deficit from 10.4% GDP in 2010 to 9.6% in 2011. Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, and Spain also improved their budget deficits from 2010 to 2011 relative to GDP.Eurostat-Selected Principal European Economic Indicators-Retrieved 15 August 2012 However, with the exception of Germany, each of these countries had public-debt-to-GDP ratios that increased (i.e., worsened) from 2010 to 2011, as indicated in the chart shown here. Greece's public-debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 143% in 2010 to 165% in 2011. This indicates that despite improving budget deficits, GDP growth was not sufficient to support a decline (improvement) in the debt-to-GDP ratio for these countries during this period. Eurostat reported that the debt to GDP ratio for the 17 Euro area countries together was 70.1% in 2008, 79.9% in 2009, 85.3% in 2010, and 87.2% in 2011. Unemployment is another variable that might be considered in evaluating austerity measures. According to the CIA World Factbook, from 2010 to 2011, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and the UK increased. France and Italy had no significant changes, while in Germany and Iceland the unemployment rate declined. Eurostat reported that Eurozone unemployment reached record levels in September 2012 at 11.6%, up from 10.3% the prior year. Unemployment varied significantly by country. Economist Martin Wolf analyzed the relationship between cumulative GDP growth from 2008 to 2012 and total reduction in budget deficits due to austerity policies (see chart) in several European countries during April 2012. He concluded that: \\"In all, there is no evidence here that large fiscal contractions [budget deficit reductions] bring benefits to confidence and growth that offset the direct effects of the contractions. They bring exactly what one would expect: small contractions bring recessions and big contractions bring depressions.\\" Changes in budget balances (deficits or surpluses) explained approximately 53% of the change in GDP, according to the equation derived from the IMF data used in his analysis. Economist Paul Krugman analyzed the relationship between GDP and reduction in budget deficits for several European countries in April 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth, similar to Martin Wolf. He also wrote: \\"this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0.4 euros of reduced deficit, even in the short run. No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster.\\" Sustained effects This chart compares U.S. potential GDP under two CBO forecasts (one from 2007 and one from 2016) versus the actual real GDP. It is based on a similar diagram from economist Larry Summers from 2014. The crisis had a significant and long-lasting impact on U.S. employment. During the Great Recession, 8.5 million jobs were lost from the peak employment in early 2008 of approximately 138 million to the trough in February 2010 of 129 million, roughly 6% of the workforce. From February 2010 to September 2012, approximately 4.3 million jobs were added, offsetting roughly half the losses. In Spring 2011 there were about a million homes in foreclosure in the United States, several million more in the pipeline, and 872,000 previously foreclosed homes in the hands of banks.Dash, E., \\"As Lenders Hold Homes in Foreclosure, Sales Are Hurt\\", The New York Times, May 22, 2011. Sales were slow; economists estimated that it would take three years to clear the backlogged inventory. According to Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics, home prices were falling and could be expected to fall further during 2011. However, the rate of new borrowers falling behind in mortgage payments had begun to decrease. The New York Times reported in January 2015 that: \\"About 17% of all homeowners are still 'upside down' on their mortgages ... That's down from 21% in the third quarter of 2013, and the 2012 peak of 31%.\\" Foreclosures as of October 2014 were down 26% from the prior year, at 41,000 completed foreclosures. That was 65% below the peak in September 2010 (roughly 117,000), but still above the pre-crisis (2000‚Äì2006) average of 21,000 per month. Research indicates recovery from financial crises can be protracted, with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic growth. Economist Carmen Reinhart stated in August 2011: \\"Debt de-leveraging [reduction] takes about seven years ... And in the decade following severe financial crises, you tend to grow by 1 to 1.5 percentage points less than in the decade before, because the decade before was fueled by a boom in private borrowing, and not all of that growth was real. The unemployment figures in advanced economies after falls are also very dark. Unemployment remains anchored about five percentage points above what it was in the decade before.\\" =Savings surplus or investment deficit= U.S. savings and investment; savings less investment is the private sector financial surplus During the crisis and ensuing recession, U.S. consumers increased their savings as they paid down debt (\\"deleveraged\\") but corporations simultaneously were reducing their investment. In a healthy economy, private sector savings placed into the banking system is borrowed and invested by companies. This investment is one of the major components of GDP. A private sector financial deficit from 2004 to 2008 transitioned to a large surplus of savings over investment that exceeded $1 trillion by early 2009 and remained above $800 billion as of September 2012. Part of this investment reduction related to the housing market, a major component of investment in the GDP computation. This surplus explains how even significant government deficit spending would not increase interest rates and how Federal Reserve action to increase the money supply does not result in inflation, because the economy is awash with savings with no place to go. Economist Richard Koo described similar effects for several of the developed world economies in December 2011: \\"Today private sectors in the U.S., the U.K., Spain, and Ireland (but not Greece) are undergoing massive deleveraging in spite of record low interest rates. This means these countries are all in serious balance sheet recessions. The private sectors in Japan and Germany are not borrowing, either. With borrowers disappearing and banks reluctant to lend, it is no wonder that, after nearly three years of record low interest rates and massive liquidity injections, industrial economies are still doing so poorly. Flow of funds data for the U.S. show a massive shift away from borrowing to savings by the private sector since the housing bubble burst in 2007. The shift for the private sector as a whole represents over 9 percent of U.S. GDP at a time of zero interest rates. Moreover, this increase in private sector savings exceeds the increase in government borrowings (5.8 percent of GDP), which suggests that the government is not doing enough to offset private sector deleveraging.\\" =Sectoral financial balances= Sectoral financial balances in US economy 1990‚Äì2017. By definition, the three balances must net to zero. Since 2009, the US foreign surplus (trade deficit) and private sector surplus have driven a government budget deficit. Economist Wynne Godley explained in 2004‚Äì2005 how U.S. sector imbalances posed a significant risk to the U.S. and global economy. The combination of a high and growing foreign sector surplus and high government sector deficit meant that the private sector was moving towards a net borrowing position (from surplus to deficit) as a housing bubble developed, which he warned was an unsustainable combination. Economist Martin Wolf explained in July 2012 that government fiscal balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in the U.S. economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by definition. In the U.S., a foreign financial surplus (or capital surplus) exists because capital is imported (net) to fund the trade deficit. Further, there is a private sector financial surplus due to household savings exceeding business investment. By definition, there must therefore exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local. For example, the government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP. Wolf argued that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the government balance into deficit, writing: \\"The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.\\" Responses Various actions have been taken since the crisis became apparent in August 2007. In September 2008, major instability in world financial markets increased awareness and attention to the crisis. Various agencies and regulators, as well as political officials, began to take additional, more comprehensive steps to handle the crisis. To date, various government agencies have committed or spent trillions of dollars in loans, asset purchases, guarantees, and direct spending. For a summary of U.S. government financial commitments and investments related to the crisis, see CNN ‚Äì Bailout Scorecard. Federal Reserve and other central banks Federal Reserve holdings of treasury (blue) and mortgage-backed securities (red) The central bank of the US, the Federal Reserve, in partnership with central banks around the world, took several steps to address the crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stated in early 2008: \\"Broadly, the Federal Reserve's response followed two tracks: efforts to support market liquidity and functioning and the pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives through monetary policy.\\" The Federal Reserve Bank: *Lowered the target for the Federal funds rate from 5.25% to 2%, and the discount rate from 5.75% to 2.25%. This took place in six steps occurring between 18 September 2007 and 30 April 2008; In December 2008, the Fed further lowered the federal funds rate target to a range of 0‚Äì0.25% (25 basis points). *Undertook, along with other central banks, open market operations to ensure member banks remain liquid. These are effectively short-term loans to member banks collateralized by government securities. Central banks have also lowered the interest rates (called the discount rate in the US) they charge member banks for short-term loans; *Created a variety of lending facilities to enable the Fed to lend directly to banks and non-bank institutions, against specific types of collateral of varying credit quality. These include the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). *In November 2008, the Fed announced a $600 billion program to purchase the MBS of the GSE, to help lower mortgage rates. *In March 2009, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of government-sponsored enterprise mortgage- backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200 billion. Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities during 2009. According to Ben Bernanke, expansion of the Fed balance sheet means the Fed is electronically creating money, necessary \\"because our economy is very weak and inflation is very low. When the economy begins to recover, that will be the time that we need to unwind those programs, raise interest rates, reduce the money supply, and make sure that we have a recovery that does not involve inflation.\\" The New York Times reported in February 2013 that the Fed continued to support the economy with various monetary stimulus measures: \\"The Fed, which has amassed almost $3 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to promote more borrowing and lending, is expanding those holdings by $85 billion a month until it sees clear improvement in the labor market. It plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero even longer, at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent.\\" Economic stimulus On 13 February 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law a $168 billion economic stimulus package, mainly taking the form of income tax rebate checks mailed directly to taxpayers. Checks were mailed starting the week of 28 April 2008. However, this rebate coincided with an unexpected jump in gasoline and food prices. This coincidence led some to wonder whether the stimulus package would have the intended effect, or whether consumers would simply spend their rebates to cover higher food and fuel prices. On 17 February 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, an $787 billion stimulus package with a broad spectrum of spending and tax cuts. Over $75 billion of the package was specifically allocated to programs which help struggling homeowners. This program is referred to as the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan. The U.S. government continued to run large deficits post-crisis, with the national debt rising from $10.0 trillion as of September 2008 to $16.1 trillion by September 2012. The debt increases were $1.89 trillion in fiscal year 2009, $1.65 trillion in 2010, $1.23 trillion in 2011, and $1.26 trillion in 2012. Bank solvency and capital replenishment Common equity to total assets ratios for major US banks Losses on mortgage-backed securities and other assets purchased with borrowed money have dramatically reduced the capital base of financial institutions, rendering many either insolvent or less capable of lending. Governments have provided funds to banks. Some banks have taken significant steps to acquire additional capital from private sources. The U.S. government passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA or TARP) during October 2008. This law included $700 billion in funding for the \\"Troubled Assets Relief Program\\" (TARP). Following a model initiated by the United Kingdom bank rescue package, $205 billion was used in the Capital Purchase Program to lend funds to banks in exchange for dividend-paying preferred stock. Another method of recapitalizing banks is for government and private investors to provide cash in exchange for mortgage-related assets (i.e., \\"toxic\\" or \\"legacy\\" assets), improving the quality of bank capital while reducing uncertainty regarding the financial position of banks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a plan during March 2009 to purchase \\"legacy\\" or \\"toxic\\" assets from banks. The Public-Private Partnership Investment Program involves government loans and guarantees to encourage private investors to provide funds to purchase toxic assets from banks. As of April 2012, the government had recovered $300 billion of the $414 billion that was ultimately distributed to them via TARP. Some elements of TARP such as foreclosure prevention aid will not be paid back. Estimated taxpayer losses were $60 billion.

For a summary of TARP funds provided to U.S. banks as of December 2008, see Reuters-TARP Funds. Bailouts and failures of financial firms People queuing outside a Northern Rock bank branch in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 15, 2007, to withdraw their savings because of the subprime crisis.Lusher, A., \\"Northern Rock shareholders tell Theresa May 10 years on: 'Give us back the money stolen by the Government'\\", The Independent, Sep 14, 2017. Several major financial institutions either failed, were bailed out by governments, or merged (voluntarily or otherwise) during the crisis. While the specific circumstances varied, in general the decline in the value of mortgage-backed securities held by these companies resulted in either their insolvency, the equivalent of bank runs as investors pulled funds from them, or inability to secure new funding in the credit markets. These firms had typically borrowed and invested large sums of money relative to their cash or equity capital, meaning they were highly leveraged and vulnerable to unanticipated credit market disruptions. The five largest U.S. investment banks, with combined liabilities or debts of $4 trillion, either went bankrupt (Lehman Brothers), were taken over by other companies (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch), or were bailed out by the U.S. government (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) during 2008. Government- sponsored enterprises (GSE) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac either directly owed or guaranteed nearly $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, with a similarly weak capital base, when they were placed into receivership in September 2008.OFHEO- Statement of Director Lockhart For scale, this $9 trillion in obligations concentrated in seven highly leveraged institutions can be compared to the $14 trillion size of the U.S. economy (GDP) or to the total national debt of $10 trillion in September 2008. Major depository banks around the world had also used financial innovations such as structured investment vehicles to circumvent capital ratio regulations. Notable global failures included Northern Rock, which was nationalized at an estimated cost of ¬£87 billion ($150 billion). In the U.S., Washington Mutual (WaMu) was seized in September 2008 by the US Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). This would be followed by the \\"shotgun wedding\\" of Wells Fargo and Wachovia after it was speculated that without the merger Wachovia was also going to fail. Dozens of U.S. banks received funds as part of the TARP or $700 billion bailout. The TARP funds gained some controversy after PNC Financial Services received TARP money, only to turn around hours later and purchase the struggling National City Corp., which itself had become a victim of the subprime crisis. As a result of the financial crisis in 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were taken over by the FDIC. As of August 14, 2009, an additional 77 banks became insolvent. This seven-month tally surpasses the 50 banks that were seized in all of 1993, but is still much smaller than the number of failed banking institutions in 1992, 1991, and 1990. The United States has lost over 6 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007. The FDIC deposit insurance fund, supported by fees on insured banks, fell to $13 billion in the first quarter of 2009. That is the lowest total since September 1993. According to some, the bailouts could be traced directly to Alan Greenspan's efforts to reflate the stock market and the economy after the tech stock bust, and specifically to a February 23, 2004 speech Mr. Greenspan made to the Mortgage Bankers Association where he suggested that the time had come to push average American borrowers into more exotic loans with variable rates, or deferred interest. This argument suggests that Mr. Greenspan sought to enlist banks to expand lending and debt to stimulate asset prices and that the Federal Reserve and US Treasury Department would back any losses that might result. As early as March 2007 some commentators predicted that a bailout of the banks would exceed $1 trillion, at a time when Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Henry Paulson all claimed that mortgage problems were \\"contained\\" to the subprime market and no bailout of the financial sector would be necessary. Homeowner assistance U.S. Changes in Household Debt as a percentage of GDP for 1989‚Äì2016. Homeowners paying down debt for 2009‚Äì2012 was a headwind to the recovery. Economist Carmen Reinhart explained that this behavior tends to slow recoveries from financial crises relative to typical recessions. U.S. federal government spending was held relatively level around $3.5 trillion from 2009-2014, which created a headwind to recovery, reducing real GDP growth by approximately 0.5% per quarter (annualized) on average between Q3 2010 and Q2 2014. Both lenders and borrowers may benefit from avoiding foreclosure, which is a costly and lengthy process. Some lenders have offered troubled borrowers more favorable mortgage terms (e.g. refinancing, loan modification or loss mitigation). Borrowers have also been encouraged to contact their lenders to discuss alternatives. The Economist described the issue this way in February 2009: \\"No part of the financial crisis has received so much attention, with so little to show for it, as the tidal wave of home foreclosures sweeping over America. Government programmes have been ineffectual, and private efforts not much better.\\" Up to 9 million homes may enter foreclosure over the 2009‚Äì2011 period, versus one million in a typical year. At roughly U.S. $50,000 per foreclosure according to a 2006 study by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, 9 million foreclosures represents $450 billion in losses. A variety of voluntary private and government- administered or supported programs were implemented during 2007‚Äì2009 to assist homeowners with case-by-case mortgage assistance, to mitigate the foreclosure crisis engulfing the U.S. One example is the Hope Now Alliance, an ongoing collaborative effort between the US Government and private industry to help certain subprime borrowers. In February 2008, the Alliance reported that during the second half of 2007, it had helped 545,000 subprime borrowers with shaky credit, or 7.7% of 7.1 million subprime loans outstanding as of September 2007. A spokesperson for the Alliance acknowledged that much more must be done. During late 2008, major banks and both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac established moratoriums (delays) on foreclosures, to give homeowners time to work towards refinancing. Critics have argued that the case-by-case loan modification method is ineffective, with too few homeowners assisted relative to the number of foreclosures and with nearly 40% of those assisted homeowners again becoming delinquent within 8 months. In December 2008, the U.S. FDIC reported that more than half of mortgages modified during the first half of 2008 were delinquent again, in many cases because payments were not reduced or mortgage debt was not forgiven. This is further evidence that case-by-case loan modification is not effective as a policy tool. In February 2009, economists Nouriel Roubini and Mark Zandi recommended an \\"across the board\\" (systemic) reduction of mortgage principal balances by as much as 20‚Äì30%. Lowering the mortgage balance would help lower monthly payments and also address an estimated 20 million homeowners that may have a financial incentive to enter voluntary foreclosure because they are \\"underwater\\" (i.e. the mortgage balance is larger than the home value). A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston indicated that banks were reluctant to modify loans. Only 3% of seriously delinquent homeowners had their mortgage payments reduced during 2008. In addition, investors who hold MBS and have a say in mortgage modifications have not been a significant impediment; the study found no difference in the rate of assistance whether the loans were controlled by the bank or by investors. Commenting on the study, economists Dean Baker and Paul Willen both advocated providing funds directly to homeowners instead of banks. The Los Angeles Times reported the results of a study that found homeowners with high credit scores at the time of entering the mortgage are 50% more likely to \\"strategically default\\" ‚Äì abruptly and intentionally pull the plug and abandon the mortgage ‚Äì compared with lower-scoring borrowers. Such strategic defaults were heavily concentrated in markets with the highest price declines. An estimated 588,000 strategic defaults occurred nationwide during 2008, more than double the total in 2007. They represented 18% of all serious delinquencies that extended for more than 60 days in the fourth quarter of 2008. =Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan= On 18 February 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a $73 billion program to help up to nine million homeowners avoid foreclosure, which was supplemented by $200 billion in additional funding for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase and more easily refinance mortgages. The plan is funded mostly from the EESA's $700 billion financial bailout fund. It uses cost sharing and incentives to encourage lenders to reduce homeowner's monthly payments to 31 percent of their monthly income. Under the program, a lender would be responsible for reducing monthly payments to no more than 38 percent of a borrower's income, with government sharing the cost to further cut the rate to 31 percent. The plan also involves forgiving a portion of the borrower's mortgage balance. Companies that service mortgages will get incentives to modify loans and to help the homeowner stay current.

Regulatory proposals and long-term solutions President Barack Obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009. The proposals address consumer protection, executive pay, bank financial cushions or capital requirements, expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives, and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind- down systemically important institutions, among others. The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010 to address some of the causes of the crisis. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner testified before Congress on October 29, 2009. His testimony included five elements he stated as critical to effective reform: # Expand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation bank resolution mechanism to include non-bank financial institutions; # Ensure that a firm is allowed to fail in an orderly way and not be \\"rescued\\"; # Ensure taxpayers are not on the hook for any losses, by applying losses to the firm's investors and creating a monetary pool funded by the largest financial institutions; # Apply appropriate checks and balances to the FDIC and Federal Reserve in this resolution process; # Require stronger capital and liquidity positions for financial firms and related regulatory authority. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed these elements, but stopped short of breaking up the largest banks, which grew larger due to mergers of investment banks at the core of the crisis with depository banks (e.g., JP Morgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns and Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch in 2008). Assets of five largest banks as a share of total commercial banking assets rose then stabilized in the wake of the crisis. During 2013, Senators John McCain (Republican) and Elizabeth Warren (Democratic) proposed a bill to separate investment and depository banking, to insulate depository banks from higher risk activities. These were separated prior to the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. Law investigations, judicial and other responses Significant law enforcement action and litigation resulted from the crisis. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation probed the possibility of fraud by mortgage financing companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and insurer American International Group, among others.FBI Investigating Potential Fraud by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman, AIG , Associated Press, September 23, 2008. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Long Island based Amerimod, one of the nation's largest loan modification corporations for fraud, and issued numerous subpoenas to other similar companies. The FBI assigned more agents to mortgage-related crimes and its caseload dramatically increased. The FBI began a probe of Countrywide Financial in March 2008 for possible fraudulent lending practices and securities fraud. Several hundred civil lawsuits were filed in federal courts beginning in 2007 related to the subprime crisis. The number of filings in state courts was not quantified but was also believed to be significant. In August 2014, Bank of America agreed to a near-$17 billion deal to settle claims against it relating to the sale of toxic mortgage-linked securities including subprime home loans, in what was believed to be the largest settlement in U.S. corporate history. The deal with the U.S. Justice Department topped a deal the regulator made the previous year with JPMorgan Chase over similar issues. Morgan Stanley paid $2.6 billion to settle claims in February 2015, without reaching closure on homeowner relief and state claim Bank fines and penalties U.S. banks have paid considerable fines from legal settlements due to mortgage-related activities. The Economist estimated that from 2008 through October 2013, U.S. banks had agreed to $95 billion in mortgage-related penalties. Settlement amounts included Bank of America ($47.2B), JP Morgan Chase ($22.3B), Wells Fargo ($9.8B), Citigroup ($6.2B) and Goldman-Sachs ($0.9B). Bloomberg reported that from the end of 2010 to October 2013, the six largest Wall St. banks had agreed to pay $67 billion. CNBC reported in April 2015 that banking fines and penalties totaled $150 billion between 2007 and 2014, versus $700 billion in profits over that time. Many of these fines were obtained via the efforts of President Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF), which was created in November 2009 to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The FFETF involves over 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorney's offices, and state and local partners. One of its eight working groups, the Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) Working Group, was created in 2012 and is involved in investigating and negotiating many of the fines and penalties described above. In popular culture Several books written about the crisis were made into movies. Examples include The Big Short by Michael Lewis and Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin. The former tells the story from the perspective of several investors who bet against the housing market, while the latter follows key government and banking officials focusing on the critical events of September 2008, when many large financial institutions faced or experienced collapse. Implications VOA Special English Economics Report from October 2010 describing how millions of foreclosed homes were seized by banks Estimates of impact have continued to climb. During April 2008, International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that global losses for financial institutions would approach $1 trillion. One year later, the IMF estimated cumulative losses of banks and other financial institutions globally would exceed $4 trillion. Francis Fukuyama has argued that the crisis represents the end of Reaganism in the financial sector, which was characterized by lighter regulation, pared-back government, and lower taxes. Significant financial sector regulatory changes are expected as a result of the crisis. Fareed Zakaria believes that the crisis may force Americans and their government to live within their means. Further, some of the best minds may be redeployed from financial engineering to more valuable business activities, or to science and technology. Roger Altman wrote that \\"the crash of 2008 has inflicted profound damage on [the U.S.] financial system, its economy, and its standing in the world; the crisis is an important geopolitical setback...the crisis has coincided with historical forces that were already shifting the world's focus away from the United States. Over the medium term, the United States will have to operate from a smaller global platform ‚Äì while others, especially China, will have a chance to rise faster.\\" GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt has argued that U.S. trade deficits and budget deficits are unsustainable. America must regain its competitiveness through innovative products, training of production workers, and business leadership. He advocates specific national goals related to energy security or independence, specific technologies, expansion of the manufacturing job base, and net exporter status. \\"The world has been reset. Now we must lead an aggressive American renewal to win in the future.\\" Of critical importance, he said, is the need to focus on technology and manufacturing. \\"Many bought into the idea that America could go from a technology-based, export-oriented powerhouse to a services-led, consumption- based economy ‚Äì and somehow still expect to prosper,\\" Jeff said. \\"That idea was flat wrong.\\" Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2009: \\"The prosperity of a few years ago, such as it was ‚Äì profits were terrific, wages not so much ‚Äì depended on a huge bubble in housing, which replaced an earlier huge bubble in stocks. And since the housing bubble isn't coming back, the spending that sustained the economy in the pre-crisis years isn't coming back either.\\" Niall Ferguson stated that excluding the effect of home equity extraction, the U.S. economy grew at a 1% rate during the Bush years. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has argued that this is an economic reset at a lower level, rather than a recession, meaning that no quick recovery to pre-recession levels can be expected. The U.S. Federal government's efforts to support the global financial system have resulted in significant new financial commitments, totaling $7 trillion by November, 2008. These commitments can be characterized as investments, loans, and loan guarantees, rather than direct expenditures. In many cases, the government purchased financial assets such as commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, or other types of asset-backed paper, to enhance liquidity in frozen markets. As the crisis has progressed, the Fed has expanded the collateral against which it is willing to lend to include higher- risk assets. The Economist wrote in May 2009: \\"Having spent a fortune bailing out their banks, Western governments will have to pay a price in terms of higher taxes to meet the interest on that debt. In the case of countries (like Britain and America) that have trade as well as budget deficits, those higher taxes will be needed to meet the claims of foreign creditors. Given the political implications of such austerity, the temptation will be to default by stealth, by letting their currencies depreciate. Investors are increasingly alive to this danger...\\" The crisis has cast doubt on the legacy of Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System from 1986 to January 2006. Senator Chris Dodd claimed that Greenspan created the \\"perfect storm\\". When asked to comment on the crisis, Greenspan spoke as follows:  Post Recession Home Ownership by Millennials  Following the recession of the 2008‚Äì2010 era, there became a bigger focus from millennials on how mortgages affect their personal finances. Most who were of working age were unable to find employment that would allow them to save enough for a house. The lack of good employment opportunities has created questions among this generation about how much of their lives that they are willing to invest into a home and if that money isn't better spent elsewhere. Mortgage Magnitude looks at how many years of life a mortgage will actually cost a consumer given the area's median income and median home value, showing homes in metropolitan areas ranging from ratios of 1:5 to 1:10. Donna Fancher researched to find if the \\"American Dream\\" of owning a home is still a realistic goal, or if it is continually shrinking for the youth of the US, writing: \\"The value of owner- occupied housing also exceeds income growth. In many markets, prospective buyers are continuing to rent due to concerns over affordability. However, demand also increases rent disproportionately.\\" While housing prices fell dramatically during the recession, prices have been steadily coming back to pre-recession prices; with a rising interest rate, home ownership could continue to be challenging for millennials. Jason Furman wrote: \\"while the unemployment rate for those over 34 peaked at about 8 percent, the unemployment rate among those between the ages of 18 and 34 peaked at 14 percent in 2010 and remains elevated, despite substantial improvement; delinquency rates on student loans have risen several percentage points since the Great Recession and even into the recovery; and the homeownership rate among young adults has dropped from a peak of 43 percent in 2005 to 37 percent in 2013 concurrent with a large increase in the share living with their parents.\\" Recovery=In the United States Several major U.S. economic variables had recovered from the 2007‚Äì2009 Subprime mortgage crisis and Great Recession by the 2013‚Äì2014 time period. U.S. median family net worth peaked in 2007, declined due to the Great Recession until 2013, and only partially recovered by 2016. The recession officially ended in the second quarter of 2009, but the nation's economy continued to be described as in an \\"economic malaise\\" during the second quarter of 2011. Some economists described the post-recession years as the weakest recovery since the Great Depression and World War II. The weak economic recovery has led many to call it a \\"Zombie Economy\\", so-called because it is neither dead nor alive. Household incomes, as of August 2012, had fallen more since the end of the recession, than during the 18-month recession, falling an additional 4.8% since the end of the recession, totally to 7.2% since the December 2007 level. Additionally as of September 2012, the long-term unemployment was the highest it had been since World War II, and the unemployment rate peaked several months after the end of the recession (10.1% in October 2009) and was above 8% until September 2012 (7.8%). The Federal Reserve kept interest rates at a historically low 0.25% from December 2008 until December 2015, when it began to raise them again. However, the Great Recession was different in kind from the all the recessions since the Great Depression, as it also involved a banking crisis and the de- leveraging (debt reduction) of highly indebted households. Research indicates recovery from financial crises can be protracted, with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic growth. Economist Carmen Reinhart stated in August 2011: \\"Debt de-leveraging [reduction] takes about seven years ... And in the decade following severe financial crises, you tend to grow by 1 to 1.5 percentage points less than in the decade before, because the decade before was fueled by a boom in private borrowing, and not all of that growth was real. The unemployment figures in advanced economies after falls are also very dark. Unemployment remains anchored about five percentage points above what it was in the decade before.\\" Then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke explained during November 2012 several of the economic headwinds that slowed the recovery: *The housing sector did not rebound, as was the case in prior recession recoveries, as the sector was severely damaged during the crisis. Millions of foreclosures had created a large surplus of properties and consumers were paying down their debts rather than purchasing homes. *Credit for borrowing and spending by individuals (or investing by corporations) was not readily available as banks paid down their debts. *Restrained government spending following initial stimulus efforts (i.e., austerity) was not sufficient to offset private sector weaknesses. For example, U.S. federal spending rose from 19.1% GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2007 to 24.4% GDP in FY2009 (the last year budgeted by President Bush) before falling towards to 20.4% GDP in 2014, closer to the historical average. In dollar terms, federal spending was actually higher in 2009 than in 2014, despite a historical trend of a roughly 5% annual increase. This reduced real GDP growth by approximately 0.5% per quarter on average between Q3 2010 and Q2 2014.CBO Historical Tables- Retrieved March 24, 2018 Both households and government practicing austerity at the same time was a recipe for a slow recovery. Several key economic variables (e.g., Job level, real GDP per capita, household net worth, and the federal budget deficit) hit their low point (trough) in 2009 or 2010, after which they began to turn upward, recovering to pre-recession (2007) levels between late 2012 and May 2014 (close to Reinhart's prediction), which marked the recovery of all jobs lost during the recession. Real median household income fell to a trough of $53,331 in 2012, but recovered to an all-time high of $59,039 by 2016. However, the gains during the recovery were very unevenly distributed. Economist Emmanuel Saez wrote in June 2016 that the top 1% of families captured 52% of the total real income (GDP) growth per family from 2009‚Äì2015. The gains were more evenly distributed after the tax increases in 2013 on higher-income earners.Saez, E., Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Berkeley: University of California, 2013), p. 1. President Obama declared the bailout measures started under the Bush Administration and continued during his Administration as completed and mostly profitable as of December 2014. As of January 2018, bailout funds had been fully recovered by the government, when interest on loans is taken into consideration. A total of $626B was invested, loaned, or granted due to various bailout measures, while $390B had been returned to the Treasury. The Treasury had earned another $323B in interest on bailout loans, resulting in an $87B profit.

Analysis of Simosthenurus fossils has contributed to the finding that there are three lineages of macropods: Sthenurinae, Macropodinae, and Lagostrophinae. The genus Simosthenurus was among the sthenurines. The two most documented members of the genus are S. maddocki and S. occidentalis, though other species have also been discovered.  Palaeobiology  Restoration of S. occidentalis Osteological information (predominantly cave floor surface finds) has yielded that Simosthenurus is part of the same family as that of modern kangaroos. However, modern kangaroos are plantigrade hoppers, using jumping as their means of locomotion, while Simosthenurus was a bipedal unguligrade, walking in a manner similar to that of hominids. Although members of Simosthenurus were no taller than most modern species of kangaroo, their robust bones, broad pelvis, long arms and short necks were unique adaptations to their browsing mode of feeding. They had single-toed hind feet had small hoof-like nails more typical of animals adapted to moving over relatively flat terrain. Simosthenurus is a highly distinct lineage of macropods, with no living descendants. However, it is possible that their closest living cousin is the banded hare-wallaby, which is now restricted to small isolated islands off the coast of Western Australia.  S. occidentalis  S. occidentalis mtDNA sequences were obtained from fossils in Tasmanian caves; the fossils yielded radiocarbon dates between 46,000 and 50,000 years ago. The sequences obtained in this study were from fossils much older than any Australian fossils that previously yielded sequences. S. occidentalis was a leaf-eating marsupial, about the size of a modern grey kangaroo, though far more robust, with adults estimated to be about 118 kg. The species has been suggested to have used a bipedal striding gait when moving slowly. This is unlike modern kangaroos, which use pentapedal motion, or 'punting', pushing off their tail and forelimbs and swinging their hindlimbs forward when moving slowly. It is thought that, by rearing up on their hind limbs and using their long arms and fingers, they could reach overhead to grasp high leaves and branches and pull them down to their mouth. They then would use their powerful jaws and striated teeth to grind the tough leaves.  S. maddocki  An adult S. maddocki was smaller than S. occidentalis, weighing only 78 kg. Like some other species from the same time period, they were apparently highly selective feeders. Local records indicate that the species was mainly located in southeastern Australia. It is uncommon to find fossils of this rare species, especially when compared to other Sthenurines.  Extinction  Skull of Simosthenurus gilli at the left S. occidentalis skeleton, Victoria Fossil Cave There are several proposed causes of the extinction of Simosthenurus. The two most popular hypotheses include human involvement and climate change.  Human impact  One theory postulates that human impact caused it. There are fewer extinct megafaunal Tasmanian species compared to those of continental Australia. This is most likely due to humans arriving in mainland Australia first. The extinction of Simosthenurus may be attributable to human over-hunting or habitat alteration. However, there is no archaeological evidence for interactions with humans, and the overlap of habitation in Australia and Tasmania of both humans and Simothenurus species, if there was one, would have been relatively short.  Climate change  Another theory is that climate change caused the extinction of this genus. The last glacial period, popularly known as the Ice Age, has been linked with a severe reduction in several megafaunal populations, including Simosthenurus.

It is a 29-story skyscraper located in downtown Kansas City, and features an observation deck. Completed in 1937, the building is designed in a Beaux-Arts and Art-Deco style with numerous architectural features and ornamentation throughout. The tallest building in Kansas City (One Kansas City Place) was modeled to be an 80‚Äôs version of city hall.https://www.emporis.com/buildings/121883/one-kansas-city-place-kansas- city-mo-usa History Situated on a city block bounded by E. 11th Street, E. 12th Street, Oak Street, and Locust Street, the 30-story structure was designed by Wight and Wight in the Neo-Classic and Beaux-Arts architectural style and built to replace and expand an earlier city hall. The building was the third city hall since the incorporation of the City of Kansas in 1853. Construction of the building lasted for 22 months and the concrete was supplied by then-political boss Tom Pendergast. Its location has served as the center of city government from 1937 to the present. When it was completed it was the tallest building in the city. It is currently the third tallest building in the city and one of the tallest city halls in America. The exterior features Indiana limestone. There is an underground parking garage that extends under the south lawn. Several types of marble were used to enhance the building‚Äôs interior design and beauty, including Pyrenees marble from southwestern France, travertine marble from Tivoli, Italy, and Verde antique marble from Vermont, among others. Some of the woods used were oak and walnut. The total cost of construction was approximately $6 million and far exceeded the $4 million bond monies allotted for the project. FeaturesInterior= The building is notable for its Art-Deco details and ornamentation. This is particularly evident within the building. As visitors enter the building, they are greeted with elaborate marble stairways and bronze architectural features honoring the history of Kansas City from its inception to the present. There are a myriad of interior details, including sculpted brass elevator doors depicting the four major modes of transportation that serve Kansas City; elaborate light fixtures in the lobby and elsewhere; and even custom brass doorknob plates. =Exterior= The seahorse fountains on the south side of City Hall. The statue of Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad on the south side of City Hall. At the top of the six story base on the exterior of the building, windows are replaced with a frieze of relief sculptures depicting the early settlement and growth of the Kansas City area. Sculptures on the exterior of the building include those by C. Paul Jennewein, Ulric Ellerhusen and Walker Hancock. There are several notable people and places included in the panels of the building including Senator Thomas Hart Benton, Benoist Troost, Kersey Coates, Lewis and Clark, the Chouteau trading post, and the Santa Fe Trail, among others. To the south of the building are fountains with two ornamental sea horses, dolphins, and seashells. The sea horses acquired the names of ‚ÄúLug‚Äù (on the west side) and ‚ÄúCut‚Äù (on the east side) soon after the fountain‚Äôs dedication, given to them by city employees. They were named for ‚ÄúLugs‚Äù of the political machine and ‚ÄúCuts‚Äù in pay experienced by city workers in the 1930s. There is also a statue of Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad, sculpted by Lorenzo Ghiglieri. The top floor of the building features an observation deck which provides free viewings with weather and security permitting.

It was named in honor of local banker John T. Reeves,http://www.geneva.edu/object/map_stadium whose heirs donated land for the complex. Constructed in 1925, Reeves Field is one of the oldest sports venues in Pennsylvania. The current seating capacity is 5,500. The stadium hosts the Geneva College Golden Tornadoes and the local high school football team, the Beaver Falls Tigers. Notable football players who played at Reeves include Joe Namath and Cal Hubbard. The stadium has also hosted the Victory Bowl twice at Geneva, which is a championship football game for the NCCAA. The first game was in 2003 when Geneva defeated North Greenville College and the second in 2007 when Malone College defeated the Golden Tornadoes 45-17. This became Malone's first win in the Victory Bowl. It was also Geneva's first loss, having won the championship in 1998, 1999, 2002, and 2003. In the fall of 2007, the Golden Tornadoes played their first season as part of the Presidents' Athletic Conference at Reeves.  Restoration  Between 2006-2008, Reeves Field was rebuilt, but in several stages. In 2006, a new scoreboard was placed on the embankment below Northwood Hall. The embankment was also redone in order to clear away old brush, and to allow some space to install the field turf. A permanent wall was also placed below the embankment to prevent landslides from going onto the field. On August 21, 2007, during the renovation, the wall collapsed onto the north end of the field.Stadium wall falls at Geneva College stadium, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2007-08-21. Accessed 2007-08-21. It took several weeks to clean up the field after the mudslide. By 2007, the grass was replaced by turf, and new stands were placed on the visitors' side of the field. Between December 2007 and September 2008, the largest phase of the project was underway to demolish the old brick wall along old Route 18. By early spring of 2008, the highway was realigned to allow more growth for the campus. A new wall with an iron fence was built to replace the old wall, and a new press box was constructed to allow more game coverage. The new wall covers more than half of what used to be old Route 18. New bleachers were also in place on the home side by the time the Golden Tornadoes played their home opener against Seton Hill University. Restoration work on the stadium was finally completed in October 2008.

It is a deciduous fern with fronds growing to 40‚Äì100 cm (rarely 130 cm) tall and 10‚Äì30 cm broad; the fronds are bipinnate, with pinnatifid pinnules about three times as long as broad.

The common name \\"Hay-scented Fern\\" comes from the fact that crushing it produces an aroma of fresh hay. The presence of Dennstaedtia punctilobula influences the dynamics of the understory vegetation of many forests in the eastern United States.

The number of victims ranges from 1,200 to 7,000, depending on the source.Religion, Ethnicity and Contested Nationhood in the Former Ottoman Space, Editors J. Rgen Nielsen, J√∏rgen S. Nielsen, Publisher BRILL, 2011, , p. 282. Uprising in Batak  The role of Batak in the April Uprising was to take possession of the storehouses in the surrounding villages and to ensure that the insurgents would have provisions, also to block the main ways and keep the Turkish soldiers from receiving supplies. The task of Batak was to manage with the Pomak villages (Chepino and Korovo) should those try to prevent the uprising. Should the chetas in the nearby locations fail in their commands, the rest should have gathered in Batak. The only problem the organization of the uprising had expected was that Batak had to defend itself alone against the Turkish troops, but the risk was taken. After the April uprising started on 30 April 1876, part of the armed men in Batak, led by the voivode Petar Goranov, attacked the Turks.–ë–æ–π—á–æ (–ê–Ω–≥–µ–ª –ü. –ì–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤), \\"–í—ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –∏ –∫–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–æ –≤ –ë–∞—Ç–∞–∫\\". –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1892 (repr. –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1991) They succeeded to eliminate part of the Ottoman leaders, but were reported to the authorities and 5,000 Bashi-bazouk were sent, mainly Pomaks (Slavic Muslims), led by Ahmet Aga from Barutin which surrounded the town.At that time the massacre on Christians in Batak took place, when Bulgarian speaking Muslims from Barutin murdered Christians.

Karpat, Isis Press, 1990, , p. 192. At that time the Pomaks were a part of the Ottoman Muslim Millet. After a first battle, the men from Batak decided to negotiate with Ahmet Aga. He promised them the withdrawal of his troops under the condition that Batak disarmed. After the rebels had laid down their weapons, the Bashi-bazouk attacked them and beheaded them.Stoyanov, Z. Memoirs of the Bulgarian Uprisings Massacre  While some of the leaders of the Revolutionary committee were surrendering the weapons, some managed to escape the village, but immediately after that all the territory was surrounded and no one else was let out. The Bashi-Bozouk went to the houses and raided them; many were burnt and they shot at everyone and everything. Many of the people decided to hide into the houses of the wealthy or in the church, which had a stronger construction and was going to protect them from the fire. On 2 May, those hidden in the House of Bogdan surrendered, because they were promised by Ahmet Aga to be spared. More than 200 men, women and children were led out, stripped out of their valuables and clothes, in order not to stain them with their blood, and were brutally killed. The Aga asked some of the wealthy men of Batak to go to his camp and lay down all the arms of the villagers. Amongst them was the mayor Trendafil Toshev Kerelov and his son, Petar Trandafilov Kerelov. They had reached an agreement that if the village were disarmed, the Pomaks would leave Batak for good. But instead, the Bulgarians were caught captive ‚Äì once the arms were confiscated, all of them were beheaded, burnt alive or impaled. The murder of the leader Trendafil Kerelov was particularly violent and was described by a witness ‚Äì his son's wife Bosilka: \\"My father in law went to meet the Bashi-B–∞zouk when the village was surrounded by the men of Ahmet Aga, who said that he wanted all the arms laid down. Trendafil went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him with a gun and the bullet scratched his eye. Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were \\"Shishak aor\\" which is Turkish for \\"to put on a skewer\\" (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until it came out of his mouth. Then they roasted him while he was still alive. He lived for half-an-hour during this terrible scene. At the time, I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women. We were surrounded by Bashi-Bozouk, who had us surrounded, and forced us to watch what was happening to Trendafil.\\"–†–∞–∑–∫–∞–∑ –Ω–∞ –æ—á–µ–≤–∏–¥–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –ë–æ—Å–∏–ª–∫–∞ –ö–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞ –≤ –†–æ–±—ä—Ä—Ç –î–∂–∞—Å–ø—ä—Ä –ú–æ—Ä. –ü–æ–¥ –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω–∞. –°. 1992, —Å. 112 One of her children, Vladimir, who was still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her eyes. \\"At the time this was happening, Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, there in front of me.

Church  The orthodox church \\"Sveta Nedelya\\" was the last keep of the rebels. Bashi-bazouk destroyed the school, where 200 people were burnt alive, hidden in the basement. Then they went straight to the church, where they dug holes into the fence of the yard and started to shoot at everyone there. The most terrifying chapter of the massacre happened on the night of 2 May 1876 in that very yard. On the morning of 3 May the Pomaks took the yard and advanced to the door of the church, but weren't able to get in ‚Äì the door was barred by the people inside.–†–æ–±—ä—Ä—Ç –î–∂–∞—Å–ø—ä—Ä –ú–æ—Ä. \\"–ü–æ–¥ –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω–∞\\". –°. 1992. –°—Ç—Ä. 91‚Äì120–ó–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–∏ –°—Ç–æ—è–Ω–æ–≤. \\"–ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –ø–æ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –≤—ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è\\"., —Å—Ç—Ä. 703‚Äì705 The defense of the church held for three days, the Turkish were shooting ceaselessly at the villagers to make them surrender. Some tried to enter the church from the roof, but were unsuccessful, although they were able to shoot some of the people inside. There was no water in the church, so the barricaded had to resort to the oil of the lamps and the blood of their own dead. They tried to dig into the floor with bare hands in order to find underground water. On the third day the survivors decided to go outside, when they realized their fate was decided. When they opened the doors of the church Ahmet Aga was waiting for them with his Bashi-bozouk. A ruthless beheading followed and only those who accepted to be converted to Islam were spared. The plans of the Ottoman leader were to populate the village with the converted villagers, but it turned out that there were not enough of them. Before the Bashi-bozouk left the village, they burnt the church, but the stone walls were preserved and only the wooden furniture and the icons were destroyed. When some Russian commissions were to go and inspect the village, 3 months later, the Ottoman authorities tried to bury the bodies, but they could not hide the smell in the air. They also painted the walls of the church, but the blood stains showed up in time. After the massacre in the church, Ahmet Aga summoned all the surviving villagers outside, saying that it would be in order to make a list of the slain and the widows. The better part of the survivors gathered, since those who did not obey would be killed. They were divided in two groups of women and men; then the Ottoman commander made the women stand back and slew all the remaining 300 men. Those women who protested were also raped and killed. On the same day there were another 300 people murdered on the wooden bridge beside the school; first their arms were cut off, then their ears, noses, shoulders, and only after that they were finished.  Batak after the massacre  According to the most sources, around 5,000 people were massacred in Batak, Perushtitsa and Bratsigovo.Bulgaria, R. J. Crampton, Oxford University Press, 2007, p.92 The total number of victims in the April uprising according to most estimates around 15,000,Genocide and gross human rights violations: in comparative perspective, Kurt Jonassohn, 1999, p.210 which is supported by Eugene Schuyler's report, published in Daily News, according to which at least 15,000 persons were killed during the April Uprising in addition to 36 villages in three districts being buried.Schuyler's Preliminary Report on the Moslem Atrocities, published with the letters by Januarius MacGahan, London, 1876. According to Donald Quataert around 1,000 Muslims were killed by Christian Bulgarians and consequently 3,700 Christians were killed by Muslims.Quataert, Donald. \\"The Ottoman Empire, 1700‚Äì1922 \\", Cambridge University Press 2005, pp.69Millman, Richard. \\"The Bulgarian Massacres Reconsidered\\". pp.218‚Äì231 A contemporary British report mentioned that only 46 Muslim men and no women and children were killed.The Eastern question: from the treaty of Paris, 1856, to the treaty of Berlin, 1878, and to the second Afghan war; George Douglas Campbell Argyll; 2005, p.229 In his work \\"The Bulgarian Massacres Reconsidered\\"., which has been described as pro- Turkish,The English historical review: Volume 96, 1981, p.170 the American historian Richard Millman states that Schuyler visited personally only 11 of the villages he reported on.

We looked again at the heap of skulls and skeletons before us, and > we observed that they were all small and that the articles of clothing > intermingled with them and lying about were all women's apparel.

By George Douglas Campbell Argyll  Accusations of revisionism  In May 2007, a public conference was scheduled in Bulgaria, aiming to present research, held by Martina Baleva and Ulf Brunnbauer, on the formation of national memory for the Batak massacre. Bulgarian media reported that the authors were denying the massacre, which was the raising of a substantial media controversy. Finally, the conference was cancelled, and several eminent Bulgarian historians (including Georgi Markov, head of the Institute of History of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Bozhidar Dimitrov, director of the National Museum of History in Sofia) qualified Baleva and Brunnbauer's research as \\"grandiose falsification\\".\\"The Batak Massacre is fact, not myth\\" Letter from 26 bulgarian historians on Baleva and Brunnbauer's work (Bulgarian) Other historians claimed that the principle of academic freedom is violated. Before the media controversy beginning The conference was scheduled to be held in Batak on 18 May 2007 as part of a project entitled \\"Feindbild Islam ‚Äì Geschichte und Gegenwart antiislamischer Stereotype in Bulgarien am Beispiel des Mythos vom Massaker in Batak\\" (\\"The Image of the Islamic Enemy - the Past and Present of Anti-Islamic stereotypes in Bulgaria as exemplified by the Myth of the Batak Massacre\\"). The project was led by Ulf Brunnbauer and Martina Baleva from the Institute of Eastern European Studies at the University of Berlin, who were also expected to read papers at the conference.Batak als bulgarischer Erinnerungsort Reaction in media Bulgarian media reported that the scientists were denying that a massacre had occurred.German Scientists Deny 5 Centuries of Bulgaria's History Sofia News Agency, 24 April 2007 There was a public outcry, widespread protests and immediate reactions on the part of the Mayor of Batak, Prime minister Sergei Stanishev, and President Georgi Parvanov.Batak massacre: Provocation Against Bulgarian National History by Olga Yoncheva, news.bg website, 25 April 2007 The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences rejected the possibility of providing a place for the conference, stating that there is a huge amount of material proof and documents for the massacres at Batak and Perushtitsa.Bulgarian Academy of Science: \\"The Myth of Batak\\" is a pseudo-scientific show by Olga Yoncheva, news.bg website, 26 April 2007 Ulf Brunnbauer and Martina Baleva apologized and asserted that the outcry was based on a misunderstanding and incorrect information.\\"The Batak massacre: a sacred subject\\" The Sofia Echo by Petar Kostadinov, 7 May 2007 They stated that their intention had been not to deny the massacre, but to critically look at some paintings and photographs related to itMonitor: The funding comes from Turkey by Dessislava Todorova, monitor.bg website, 25 April 2007 \\\\- an issue that Baleva had published an article on a year earlier.–ë–∞–ª–µ–≤–∞, –ú–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–∞. 2006. –ö–æ–π (–ø–æ)–∫–∞–∑–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∑–∞ –ë–∞—Ç–∞–∫. –í.–ö—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–∞, –ë—Ä–æ–π 17 (2412), 03 –º–∞–π 2006 –≥.

Naum Kaychev, assistant professor at Sofia University's Faculty of History, criticized this view in an article seeking to point out certain contradictions and factual errors in Baleva's paper that had been supposed to be read at the cancelled conference.–ö–∞–∫ –ë–∞—Ç–∞–∫ –≤–ª–µ–∑–µ –≤ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—è –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–µ–Ω —Ä–∞–∑–∫–∞–∑ –ù–∞—É–º –ö–∞–π—á–µ–≤, –≤. \\"–ö—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–∞\\", 21 —é–Ω–∏ 2006 –≥ One point of Kaychev's article was to show that national memory of the massacre existed long before Piotrowski's painting - for example, the massacre is described in a school history book in 1881, while Piotrowski's painting only appeared in 1892. In response, Baleva conceded that she had been wrong in claiming that Batak had been entirely forgotten before the painting was created. She nevertheless argued, among other things, that Piotrowski's work did have a significant influence on subsequent national memory of the massacre and on the form of the Batak memorial in particular.http://www.mediapool.bg/show/?storyid=128167 –•–∏–∞—Ç—É—Å—ä—Ç –ë–∞—Ç–∞–∫. –ú–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –ë–∞–ª–µ–≤–∞, –≤. \\"–ö—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–∞\\", 7 —Å–µ–ø—Ç–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 2006 –≥.

The son of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus and Elizabeth Boyd, daughter of Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd, he was born at Tantallon Castle and died at the Battle of Flodden. Overview In 1489 the 5th Earl of Angus, Douglas's father resigned his lordships of Tantallon, Douglasdale, Liddesdale, Ewesdale, Eskdale, Selkirk, and Jedburgh Forest to the crown. James III then granted a new charter in favour of the Master. During the stand off between James III and the party backing his son James, then Duke of Rothesay, the Master attended the last parliament of the king before his death in the Battle of Sauchieburn. It is not recorded to which faction the younger Angus adhered to. He attended parliament again under the newly crowned James IV in 1490. The Master did not take an active part in Public affairs until 1499 when he took formal control over his lordships of Eskdale and Ewesdale. These lordships had become renowned for lawlessness and banditry, and the Master was appointed by the King as warden of Eskdale. In his capacity of Warden he met with his English counterpart Lord Dacre at Canonbie to hear grievances and fix punishments. The Younger Angus was not a particularly effective at restoring law and order. His undue leniency to his own tenantry caused the King to deprive him of office in 1506, granting it instead to Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home. George did however, gain the Barony of Crawford-Lindsay in 1510, and his father made over his estates of Kirriemuir, Abernethy, and Horsehopecleugh in the same year. Death at Flodden Field In late August 1513 the Master of Angus rode out with his father the Earl, and his younger brother Sir William Douglas of Glenbervie at the head of a large Douglas contingent and their adherents. On reaching the mustering point at the Ellemford, north of Duns, they joined with the largest and most modern army that Scotland had ever fielded. The army proceeded under King James into England where it eventually met with the army of the Earl of Surrey at Flodden Edge. A petulant Earl of Angus, having had his advice snubbed by King James, left the field and returned to Scotland, leaving the Master and his brother in charge of the Douglas contingent. Nothing more is recorded of the Master of Angus except an anecdote recorded by David Hume of Godscroft recording the last moments of King James. When Sir Edward Stanley had broken the Scottish left under the Earl of Lennox and Earl of Argyll. King James in the centre dismounted and prepared to make his stand amongst his spearmen. On noticing the Master of Angus still on horseback, he cried to him, \\"asking if it had been in the manner of his race to remain mounted while their sovereign fought on foot\\". To which the Master replied asking whether \\"it was the fashion of the King of Scots to wear his mail and armorial bearings while fighting on foot\\". The master hit a raw nerve in James's chivalric mind and he replied \\"I dare fight upon my feet as well as you or any subject I have, and that without coat- armour or royal cognisance.\\" The English billmen now closed on the Scottish centre and King James was found within a spear length of Surrey. Whether Godscroft's anecdote is true or not, that the Master of Angus's taunts drove him to his death, the Master was equal to the King in reckless gallantry. The Master's corpse was found amongst the twelve Scottish Earls and seventeen Lords who lost their lives. According to Godscroft over 200 men of the name of Douglas also died. Marriage In 1485 the Master of Angus was contracted in marriage to Margaret, daughter of Laurence Oliphant, 1st Lord Oliphant. It appears that this contract was not fulfilled as George was wed in 1488 to Elizabeth Drummond, daughter of John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond. The marriage ran afoul of the strictures of a small feudal society such as Scotland: it was found out some years after the marriage that it was within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. The Master of Angus applied for and successfully obtained Papal dispensation in 1495.

The service was launched by Google on March 11, 2009, after the company had acquired the service GrandCentral. Google Voice provides a U.S. telephone number, chosen by the user from available numbers in selected area codes, free of charge to each user account. Calls to this number are forwarded to telephone numbers that each user must configure in the account web portal. Multiple destinations may be specified that ring simultaneously for incoming calls. Service establishment requires a United States telephone number. A user may answer and receive calls on any of the ringing phones as configured in the web portal. During a received call the user may switch between the configured telephones. Users may place outbound calls to domestic and international destinations. Calls may be initiated from any of the configured telephones, as well as from a mobile device app, or from the account portal. As of August 2011, users in many other countries also may place outbound calls from the web-based application to domestic and international phone numbers. Many other Google Voice services‚Äîsuch as voicemail, free text messaging, call history, call screening, blocking of unwanted calls, and voice transcription to text of voicemail messages‚Äîare also available to . In terms of product integration, transcribed and audio voicemails, missed call notifications, and/or text messages can optionally be forwarded to an email account of the user's choice. Additionally, text messages can be sent and received via the familiar email or IM interface by reading and writing text messages in numbers in Google Talk respectively (PC- to-Phone texting). Google Voice multi-way videoconferencing (with support for document sharing) is now integrated with Google+ Hangouts. The service is configured and maintained by the user in a web-based application, styled after Google's e-mail service, Gmail, or with Android and iOS apps on smart phones or tablets. Google Voice provides free PC-to-phone calling within the United States and Canada, and PC-to-PC voice and video calling worldwide between users of the Google+ Hangouts browser plugin (available for Windows, Intel- based Mac OS X, and Linux). Almost all domestic and outbound calls to the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) and CanadaA few domestic calls are also billed at $0.01 per minute. are free from the U.S. and Canada, and $0.01 per minute from everywhere else. International calls are billed according to a schedule posted on the Google Voice website. Late in 2009, Google Voice had approximately 1.4 million users, of which 570,000 used the service 7 days a week. This number rose markedly after Google made the transition of its Google Voice service from \\"invitation only\\" to be available to all Gmail subscribers in the United States. A Wired blog post quoted a figure of 3.5 million in 2013. Google Account customers in most other countries other than the U.S. and Canada may only access the call termination services through the integration with Google Hangouts. Overview Google provides free PC-to-PC voice calling worldwide. As described above, Google Voice users in many countries may make low-cost calls to international phone numbers, and may also make free PC-to- phone calls within the United States and Canada. Vincent Paquet, a co-founder of GrandCentral who became a senior product manager at Google, said in 2009 that he expected Google Voice domestic service to remain free because the cost of operation is so low and, \\"We can generate enough revenue from international calling to support the service.\\" Several years after this prediction, the service remains free of charge. A Google Voice local phone number for incoming calls is available only for users in the United States. Users may select a single U.S. phone number from various area codes. Incoming calls to the number may ring simultaneously any of the user's configured phones or the account's Google Talk feature. Based on the calling number, or contact group (e.g., Family, Friends, Work), or on time of day (e.g., disabling a home phone during business hours and routing calls to mobile or business number), individual numbers may be configured to ring. The service also features voicemail with indexable automated voicemail transcription, accessible via a web browser, e-mail, or by phone. Google Voice provides automatic blocking of known numbers, e.g., telemarketers, the ability to switch lines in mid-call, differentiated voice mail greetings based on caller, Short Message Service (SMS) forwarding, and call recording. Previously, customers of Gizmo5, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) service vendor acquired by Google, were allowed to forward calls to their Gizmo service which may be answered using a free computer application, or a web application, or SIP-based telephone hardware. Google discontinued Gizmo5 service on April 3, 2011. There are several competing virtual number services, such as eVoice. Personal numbering services have been available in the United Kingdom since 1993, similar to the AT&T; True Connections 500 service offered in the 1990s in the United States. AT&T;'s service required the direct involvement of AT&T; to change the phone number list, while the Google service is user-configurable on the web application. The original voice of GrandCentral and Google Voice belonged to actress and voice-over artist, Laurie Burke , but has been replaced with recordings by Kiki Baessell, a Googler who had no experience in professional voice-overs, but was chosen because of her pleasant, familiar voice. History=Origin GrandCentral, founded in 2005 by Craig Walker and Vincent Paquet with funding by Minor Ventures, was acquired by Google on July 2, 2007, for US$95 million in a transaction led by Miles Agha. Although Grand Central users were able to continue to use the service after the purchase, new users were not accepted, and Google made no public statements about their plans for the service. On March 11, 2009, the management of the service revealed that the team had been working on it throughout that period, apparently in secret, and that it was being rebranded \\"Google Voice\\". It was to keep most of the functionality originally offered in GrandCentral and add new features. Google hired a telecom design consultant, Peter Bouchard; he was brought on to make modifications and help relaunch the service. Google transition Google Voice was launched on March 11, 2009, based on GrandCentral, with new features, including voicemail transcriptions and SMS managing. However, GrandCentral's Ringback Tone feature was not transitioned over to Google Voice. Google transitioned former GrandCentral accounts to Google Voice and announced that the service would start accepting new members \\"within weeks\\" of the announcement. On June 25, 2009, NBC's Today Show stated that Google Voice would be available nationwide on that day. Google confirmed this in a Twitter message stating: \\"Google Voice on NBC Today Show. Invites to people on reservations list starting to go out today.\\" The expansion was at first limited to users queuedWalker, Craig.

Users with paid-in balances also received a limited number of invitation opportunities. On July 1, 2009, Google Voice provided the option for users to change their service phone number for a U.S. $10 fee. On September 15, 2009, GrandCentral calling services were discontinued. Subscribers who used the website could still log into the site to retrieve old messages and data. After termination of GrandCentral phone services, users who haven't moved over to Google Voice were still advised to upgrade their account to Google Voice. Gizmo5 acquisition On November 12, 2009, Google announced that it had acquired Gizmo5 for a reported U.S. $30 million in cash. A major effect of this announcement was that Gizmo5 suspended new signups pending re-launch by Google. Google was reported to be working on a desktop application, though rumors also circulated that the project had been scrapped in favor of a browser-based solution.Google Voice Desktop App Launch Delayed, May Be Scrapped.

Rejection from the iPhone app store On July 27, 2009, Apple Inc. rejected a Google Voice app that had been submitted by Google six weeks earlier. Other apps created for use with Google Voice, such as GVdialer, GV Mobile and VoiceCentral, were removed from the App Store. Apple states that the reason for the rejection and removals is that these apps replaced certain iPhone functions and features. A Google spokesman released this statement on the matter: > We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms, > including the iPhone. Apple Inc. did not approve the Google Voice > application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store. We will > continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users ‚Äì for example, by > taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened an inquiry regarding the rejection of Google Voice for the iPhone. \\"The FCC asked why Apple rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone and removed related 'third-party applications' from its store.\\" The FCC has also requested Google to submit a letter describing the application of Google Voice. \\"The request is part of a broader-ranging inquiry by the commission on exclusive deals between cell phone carriers and handset manufacturers for hot phones.\\" In their response to the FCC, Google stated that the Google Voice application uses the carrier's voice network to place phone calls, dispelling misconceptions that it is a Voice over Internet Protocol application. AT&T; stated that they had no role in approval or rejection of the Google Voice application. Apple stated that they had not rejected the application but were continuing to examine it. One argument against allowing the Google Voice app on the iPhone is that they are concerned that it replaces the iPhone user interface with its own; however many dialers and messaging apps are available from the app store. As a result of rejection from the Apple Store, Google released its Google Voice iPhone application as a web app in January 2010, and certain apps like GV Mobile are available through Cydia on jailbroken iPhones. In September 2010, Sean Kovacs, creator of the app GV Mobile +, announced on his Twitter that Apple had re- accepted the application, and it has since been available for purchase on the Apple App Store. This is the second Google Voice service app available in the Apple's official application store for a year and a half, released just a day after \\"GV Connect\\" had been available. In November 2010, the official Google Voice iPhone application became available in the App Store in the United States, but was still not available in other countries. Google Hangouts In September 2014, certain Google Voice features were integrated into the Google Hangouts application, an instant messaging client, which is a replacement for Google Talk. 2017 update In January 2017, Google made the first significant updates to Google Voice in approximately five years for Android, iOS, and the Web. The user interface was overhauled with Material Design. Group and photo MMS became natively supported in Voice, not depending on Hangouts integration. Voicemail transcription for Spanish was introduced, and Google promised to provide new updates and features.

While many customers in countries beside the United States have been grandfathered into Google Voice services, the features are reduced and customers are often charged for calls to their own countries. Google Voice PC-to-phone calling works only for calls into the United States and Canada or for domestic or international calls from the United States and Canada; Google plans to implement this for other countries, but a time frame has not been released.

Retrieved on December 7, 2010. Caller ID As a call forwarding service, Google Voice also forwards the caller line identification (CLID or caller ID) of incoming calls to the user's telephone service. A user can choose whether to display a caller's CLID, or their Google Voice number, when receiving calls via the service. Google Voice uses the caller's Google Voice number as the CLID on outgoing calls when the user places a call by calling the user's own Google Voice number and using the service's menu choices, or when the web-based account portal is used to place a call. With the introduction of the Google Voice application on iPhone, Android and BlackBerry phones, Google Voice users can directly dial from the Google Voice app with their Google Voice number as the outgoing CLID. Mobile phone applications Example of Google Voice inbox running on Android Jelly Bean Google Voice applications for Android and iOS can automatically place outgoing calls and texts via the user's Google Voice service. They will also manage incoming texts and calls should the user desire. This allows Google Voice subscribers to send and receive free text messages on their mobile phones without paying for a texting plan or incurring service charges from their mobile provider, so long as all texts are sent and received through one's Google Voice number and not the number provided by the cell phone company.

Users can also opt to have their text messages, transcribed voicemails (including an audio attachment), and/or missed calls forwarded to their Gmail account. Forwarded text messages emails can be replied to as if they were regular emails. Contacts' SMS capable phones can also be added to the user's Gmail address book or Google Talk buddy list so that text conversations can be initiated and sustained through these interfaces. Limitations=No emergency calling Google Voice refers to itself as an \\"enhanced call management application\\" and as such \\"is not capable of placing or receiving emergency services calls.\\" Attempting to dial 911 in the U.S. indicates that the number is not valid. Limited international texting service Google Voice supports sending text messages to phone numbers in the U.S. and Canada, but users can receive text messages from anywhere in the world. VoIP services Google Voice permits Voice Over IP (VoIP) as a beta from both the web and Android clients. It formerly supported XMPP signaling but no longer does. However, it has been reported that at one time some users could receive calls with their Google Voice accounts via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Third-party devices Hardware manufacturers such as Obihai Technology have created devices that enable the home user to use conventional wired telephone(s) to place and receive calls over their broadband connection through Google Voice, as well as other service providers. Google Voice terminated support for some XMPP services in May 2014, disrupting service for 3rd party apps. Affected vendors included Talkatone, GrooveIP and Obihai. Obihai initially recommended its users to switch to rival providers but returned with official Google Voice support for its hardware analog telephone adapters on September 11, 2014. Software manufacturers offer applications, such as PCPhoneSoft.com's \\"GVJack\\" App that converts magicJack dongles to use Google Voice. The GVJackApp for magicJack and the GVMate Phone Adapter are signalling independent and continued to work (using Google Hangouts) after support for XMPP was terminated. Call forwarding and voicemail If the telephone to which a call is forwarded does not connect within 25 seconds, then calls are routed to Google Voice's voicemail. Users who want calls to be picked up by their home, work, or mobile phone voicemail systems or answering machines must turn off call screening in Google Voice and make sure that their phone's voicemail systems or answering machines pick up before 25 seconds. Support Google Voice provides no direct phone support contact number. However, users can access the Google Voice Help Center FAQ, and use the free Google Groups official Google Voice product forum for support. Partners and infrastructure Google Voice's partners that provide phone numbers, call- termination, call-routing, and other infrastructure include: *Bandwidth.com *Broadvox Communications *Global Crossing *IBasis for international outbound call routing *Level 3 Communications *Neustar *Pac-West Telecom In 2009, Google reserved 1 million telephone numbers with Level 3 Communications which were presumed to be for Google Voice. Dispute between AT&T; and Google about call blocking AT&T; petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require Google (as it requires POTS providers) to allow calls to high-cost destinations, typically rural independent telephone companies with wholesale prices up to ten times above the national average. Google responded that it is not obligated to allow these calls. Exploitation Google Voice requires an existing phone number to register. Scammers wanting multiple anonymous unauthorized Google Voice numbers have tricked strangers into registering Google Voice numbers to their personal phone numbers.craigslist scam - google voice - Google Voice HelpDon't fall for the double-digit phone scam - Archer Security Group  See also  * Bandwidth.com * Burner (mobile application) * Caller ID spoofing * Comparison of VoIP software * Google Fi * Level 3 Communications * PrivatePhone * Public switched telephone network * Traffic pumping  References  Further reading  *  External links  * * , an explanatory video from Google Voice Category:Telecommunication services Category:Telecommunications in the United States Category:VoIP services Category:VoIP software Category:2009 software ","title":"Google Voice"},{"id":"10062741","text":"P√®re Fouettard (; ) is a character who accompanies Saint Nicholas on his rounds during Saint Nicholas Day (6 December) dispensing lumps of coal and/or beatings to naughty children while St. Nicholas gives gifts to the well behaved. He is known mainly in the far north and eastern regions of France, in the south of Belgium, and in French-speaking Switzerland, although similar characters exist all over Europe (see Companions of Saint Nicholas). This \\"Whipping Father\\" was said to bring a whip with him to spank all of the naughty children who misbehaved. Origin The most popular story about the origin of Le P√®re Fouettard was first told in the year 1150. An innkeeper (or in other versions a butcher) captures three boys who appear to be wealthy and on their way to enroll in a religious boarding school. Along with his wife, he kills the children in order to rob them. One gruesome version tells that they drug the children, slit their throats, cut them into pieces, and stew them in a barrel. St. Nicholas discovers the crime and resurrects the children. After this, Le P√®re Fouettard repents and becomes St. Nicholas' partner. A slightly different version of this story claims that St. Nicholas forced Le P√®re Fouettard to become his assistant as a punishment for his crimes. Another story states that during the Siege of Metz (a city in Eastern France) in 1552, an effigy of king Charles V was burned and dragged through the city. Meanwhile, an association of tanners created a grotesque character (also a tanner) armed with a whip and bound in chains who punished children. After Metz was liberated, the charred effigy of Charles V and the character created by the tanners somehow assimilated into what is now known as Le P√®re Fouettard. Events surrounding the city's liberation and the burning of the effigy coincided with the passage of St. Nicholas, hence Le P√®re Fouettard became his \\"bad cop\\" counterpart. In the 1930s, Le P√®re Fouettard appeared in the United States under the translated name Father Flog or Spanky. Although almost identical to the original French personification, Father Flog had nothing to do with Christmas and also had a female accomplice named Mother Flog. The two doled out specific punishments for specific childhood crimes (e.g. cutting out the tongue for lying). Appearance The most common depiction of Le P√®re Fouettard is of a man with a sinister face dressed in dark robes with scraggly unkempt hair and a long beard. He is armed with a whip, a large stick, or bundles of switches. Some incarnations of the character have him wearing a wicker backpack in which children can be placed and carried away. Sometimes he merely carries a large bundle of sticks on his back. In the last hundred years his appearance has changed from burly bearded to one of blackface. Although traditional portrayals clearly show a white old man in a black robe, communities have seen a rise in grown men donning blackface, claiming that it is just dirt. In these more recent representations, Le P√®re Fouettard are identical to the Dutch character Zwarte Piet (Black Peter). Groups have protested the racist representation of the character and asked for abolishment of the character. Early renderings of the character show him as being nearly identical to Saint Nicholas or Santa Claus, but wearing a black suit. P√®re Fouettard in popular culture * Jacques Dutronc's song La Fille du p√®re No√´l (The daughter of Father Christmas) is about P√®re Fouettard's son having a crush on Santa Claus' daughter. * Another French pop star, Alain DeLorme, mentioned him in the song \\"Venez Venez St. Nicolas\\" * There is a restaurant named Le P√®re Fouettard at 9 Rue Pierre Lescot, in Paris which features \\"Classic Parisian Fare\\". * Robert Schumann composed a piano piece in 1848 most commonly known as Knecht Ruprecht (a similar character, see Companions of Saint Nicholas), but in some cases the piece is called Le P√®re Fouettard. * Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab, a line of hand-blended perfume oils, created a limited-edition Yule scent in 2008 named Le P√®re Fouettard consisting of \\"Whip leather, coal dust, gaufrette, and black licorice.\\" * P√®re Fouettard (renamed \\"Gruzzlebeard\\" in the English translation) was the main antagonist in the animated show The Secret World of Santa Claus.

The present commission came into existence on 31 October 1972. History There has been a history of law reform in common law countries such as Australia. Prior to the establishment of the commission, various parliamentary inquiries, ad hoc commissions, or panels had advised on law reform. One of the first systematic attempts was in 1822 and 1823, when Commissioner John Thomas Bigge, a former Chief Justice of Trinidad, prepared three reports on the state of the colony of New South Wales. Those reports recommended various changes in the legal system, government, and use of convicts in the colonies.National Museum of Australia - NMA Homepage The present commission is a successor to that grand history of law reform in Australia. The commission was the first permanent body established in Western Australia to continually conduct and investigate law reform. Its establishment was important as it was an independent body that could devote its deliberations full-time to examining law reform in the state Constitution The commission is established under the Law Reform Commission Act 1972 (WA). The Governor of Western Australia may appoint members of the commission. Two members are to be full-time and three members are to be part-time. The part- time members are to include a lawyer, a senior academic from a university, and a senior office of the Western Australian State Solicitor Office. Part-time members are appointed for three years. The full-time members are to be lawyers or other people who in the opinion of the governor have the necessary experience to be on the commission. Full-time members are appointed for five years. The chairperson is elected by the members of the commission. The current chairperson is Gillian Braddock . Functions The Commission from time to time will make recommendations to the Attorney-General of Western Australia for possible references for the Commission to consider. The Attorney-General may direct the Commission to report on those suggestions, or may direct the Commission to report on other matters. The Attorney-General may also direct the Commission as to the order in which reports are to be considered. After completing the report, the Commission forwards it to the Attorney General, who then is required to table it in the Western Australian Parliament. The Commission is also required to make an annual report on its work during the year. The commission's reporting year starts in July and ends in June. The report is then provided to the Attorney-General, who may then table the report in the State Parliament. Work of the commission Some of the reports of the commission include reports on Courts of Petty Session, the criminal justice system, law of contempt, aboriginal customary laws and the judicial review of administrative decisions.

Some systems with advanced features are referred to as an Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR).See External link: Federal Communications Commission definition of SMR below. Specialized Mobile Radio is a term defined in US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. The term is of US regulatory origin but may be used in other regions to describe similar commercial systems which offer a radio communications service to businesses. History SMRs were created when the Federal Communications Commission began to license business and commercial 800 MHz two-way radio systems in the late 1970s.The date is unclear. The FCC web site has a page under the Wireless Telecommunication Bureau defining Specialized Mobile Radio Service. It claims licenses were first issued in 1979. Another publication suggests licenses were first issued in 1976. See: \\"3.6.1 Overview,\\" Statewide Radio Interoperability Needs Assessment, (Phoenix, Arizona: Macro Corporation and The State of Arizona, 2004) pp. 30.) Compatibility and purpose Any company, such as a taxi service, towing service, or construction company, may use an SMR service. These concerns may rent radios from the SMR operator or may buy compatible radios. SMR systems use differing protocols, frequency ranges, and modulation schemes: not every radio is compatible with every SMR system. These systems generally consist of one or more repeaters used to maintain communications between a dispatch fleet of mobile or hand-held walkie talkie radios. One- to five-channel systems may be conventional two-way radio repeaters. More than five channel systems must be trunked. Fees The radio system is operated by a commercial service. Paying a fee allows users to utilize the radio system backbone, increasing their range. Some SMR systems offer telephone interconnect. This allows telephone calls to be made from the mobile radio or walkie talkie. Some systems may also offer selective calling, allowing customers to communicate with individual radios or segments of their entire radio fleet. Users are charged a fee for some combination of: *Air time (the amount of time any of the user's radio units is talking). *A monthly fee covering site lease costs, engineering, maintenance, and overhead. *Rental of radio units, in some cases. Conventional two-way radio SMR system In conventional systems, units are separated into groups by selective calling. Radios are usually segmented into customers with each customer on a separate selective calling code. Systems may use continuous tone-coded squelch system for this purpose. A disadvantage is that conventional systems require the user to disable selective calling, (to monitor,) in order to see if another company is talking before using the channel. Conventional systems are usually analog FM.Block diagram of a five channel trunked system. Trunked SMR system In trunked systems, units are separated into virtual groups by the embedded radio system logic. Channel assignments are controlled by a computer and software. These virtual groups are often referred to as \\"fleet\\" and \\"subfleet\\" or \\"talk groups\\". There is no monitor function on trunked systems, but users may get busy signals or cryptic overload messages on their radio's display if an attempt is made to transmit while all channels are busy.Some Nextel phones give the message, 'Please try again' when all channels are busy. A service operating an SMR system must maintain a certain number of users for each licensed channel. This is called loading. The service must show adequate loading before licenses for more channels can be granted. Quality of service In SMR systems, many factors affect the quality of service. This may include the capacity of the radio system versus the number of radio units using the system. A talkative user community may cause busy signals while a disciplined, professional group of SMR users may keep channels idle. Some systems experience seasonal peaks. For example, a trunked system in an agricultural area used by crop harvesting crews may overload and experience busy signals during peaks in harvesting. A system used by a ski resort may overload on a holiday weekend. Disaster planning experts like to say that trunked system users are likely to hear busy signals for the first time when a disaster occurs. A major flood or earthquake is likely to generate a level of call traffic that loads the system to capacity.SMR systems are not designed and built to the same standards as government trunked systems used to manage emergencies. There are many documents addressing this issue. One article discussing this topic is, \\"Intra- and Inter-County Coordination and Interoperability: Existing Cooperative Agreements,\\" Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan, Final Report, June 18, 2002, (Fairfax, Virginia: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002) pp. 25. Siting of the system affects coverage: the system antennas should overlook the desired coverage area. Federal Communications Commission regulations require systems using the same radio frequency to be spaced 70 miles from one another or do an engineering study to confirm there will be no interference from closer spacing. Maintenance practices also can affect quality. In some systems, the operator may remove one channel of a trunked system from service to perform repairs. In a heavily used system, this could cause busy signals. Engineering documentation for these systems suggests another evaluation would be delivered audio quality. This is a measurement of the sound quality over all of the involved pieces of communications equipment from end to end. The first clue this may be an issue is that radio users with normal hearing have trouble understanding others when speaking over the radio.

Hughes Parry Hall was one of eight intercollegiate halls of the University of London. The Hall was part of the Garden Halls grouping administered by the bursarial team also responsible for Canterbury Hall and Commonwealth Hall. At the time of writing Hughes Parry Hall is closed as part of the University of London's redevelopment of its student accommodation on Cartwright Gardens. In August 2013 the University received planning permission to redevelop the Garden Halls site.http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2013/aug/property-controversial- student-digs-approved-plans-expensive-halls-residence-mean-bloo The hall's last residents moved out on 14 June 2014, after which the hall was closed.http://www.london.ac.uk/ghdevelopment.html The redevelopment is in progress and includes the demolition of a four storey wing of the original 1960s building. The 13 storey tower which forms the bulk of the building is being refurbished and will return as part of the redevelopment. Facilities Prior to its closure in 2014 the hall accommodated just over 300 residents. The hall was open to students from all colleges, but because of its proximity to the colleges concerned students from UCL, King's and the LSE tended to dominate the student body. The hall was opened in 1969 and its design and facilities bore witness to the exigencies of that time: the thirteen-story tower block had shared bathroom facilities and there was little by way of communal kitchen arrangements (although the hall provided both breakfast and evening meals). There were squash courts, TV and games rooms, and an active student society, run by a committee drawn from the students. The hall also benefited from its location overlooking Cartwright Gardens in WC1 where tennis courts were available to residents. In the early days of the Hall, at Christmas the students were accustomed to wrap decorative paper around the life-size statue of John Cartwright in the Gardens that are named after him, though this tradition ceased in the 1970s. History Although Hughes Parry Hall was affectionately known by some students as \\"Huge Party Hall\\", it is in fact named after the distinguished lawyer and Vice-Chancellor of the University, Sir David Hughes Parry (1893‚Äì1973). The hall was originally for male students only; it became a mixed residence in 1971. The adjacent Canterbury (female) and Commonwealth (male) halls remained single-sex well into the 80s; Wardens The first warden, Dr Jeffery David Lewins, was appointed in December 1968. The first students were admitted in 1969 and the Hall was officially opened by the Chancellor of the university, her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in February 1970. Dr Lewins spent ten years in the hall with his family. For most of the 1980s the warden was Dr P Throsby, famed among students for his lavish invitation-only dinner parties. From 1995 to 2009, the Warden of Hughes Parry Hall was Professor Martyn Rady. In 2009, Professor Rady was succeeded as Warden by his hitherto deputy, Dr Paul Stock. Fiona Elder retained responsibility as Bursar for Hughes Parry, for the other two halls in Cartwright Gardens and also for Connaught Hall and College Hall.

Since the 1980s, the JSO has been based in the Henry Crown Symphony Hall, part of the Jerusalem Theater complex. Henry Crown Symphony Hall home of the orchestra History The Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, now in its 83rd season, was founded as the Palestine Broadcasting Service Orchestra in the late 1930s. In 1948 it became the national radio orchestra and was known as the ‚ÄúKol Israel Orchestra‚Äù. In the 1970s, the orchestra was expanded into the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, Israel Broadcasting Authority. As a radio symphony orchestra, the majority of the concerts which the orchestra holds at its resident hall ‚Äì the Henry Crown Auditorium ‚Äì are being recorded and broadcast over Kan Kol Ha‚Äômusika station. The current Music Director of the JSO is Maestro Steven Sloane. The orchestra has had eight musical directors hitherto: Mendi Rodan, Lukas Foss, Gary Bertini, Lawrence Foster, David Shallon and Fr√©d√©ric Chaslin. The orchestra maintains a varied repertoire which ranges from the Baroque and the Classical periods through the Romantic period, extending to contemporary composers, many of whom have received their Israeli premi√®res with the JSO. The orchestra was the first Israeli Orchestra to perform the works of renowned composers such as Sofia Gubaidolina, Henry Dutilleux, Alfred Schnittke and others. Since its inception the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra has consistently encouraged Israeli composers by commissioning and performing their works. Over the decades, some of the music world‚Äôs legendary musicians have performed with the JSO, with memorable performances by Igor Stravinsky, Otto Klemperer, Arthur Rubinstein, Yehudi Menuhin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Isaac Stern, Pablo Casals, Igor Markevitch, Henryk Szeryng, Yo Yo Ma, Pierre Boulez, Neville Mariner, Christa Ludwig, Tabea Zimmermann, Martha Argerich, Radu Lupu, Jose Carreras, Jean Pierre Rampal, Maxim Vengerov and Yefim Bronfman. Among the most notable premi√®res performed by the orchestra: the opera David by Milhaud (1954); the cantata Abraham and Isaac by Stravinsky, conducted by Robert Craft (1964); and The Seven Gates of Jerusalem by Krzysztof Penderecki conducted by Maestro Lorin Maazel, which was commissioned as the conclusion for the Jerusalem 3000 celebrations (1999). In the past, the orchestra took particular pride in the Liturgical Festival, founded by Maestro Gary Bertini, which presented music of worship from the three major religions. The festival has now been incorporated into the concert season as a series of vocal and liturgical concerts. The orchestra performs regularly at the Israel Festival. In 2008 the JSO presented the Israeli premi√®re of Das Klagende Lied (Mahler) with conductor Uri Segal and the Warsaw Philharmonic Choir. The JSO often conducts tours in Europe and in the United States, and has played in some of the most prestigious venues, including the Musikvereine in Vienna, the Philharmonie in Cologne and Carnegie Hall in New-York. In February 2015 the JSO was invited by UNESCO to Paris to perform Shostakovich‚Äôs Symphony No. 13, Babi Yar in a special concert which commemorated the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Even more recently, in August 2015 the orchestra toured in Brazil with Maestro Chaslin and Israeli soloist Itamar Zorman and in 2016 toured the US and Japan. In June 2009 the orchestra performed the oratorio Elijah (Mendelssohn) at the closing event of the annual Bachfest in Leipzig. The orchestra is supported by the Ministry of Culture and Sport and the Jerusalem City municipality.

Biography Wasson at an outcrop, circa 1920 Wasson was born Isabel Deming Bassett in Brooklyn, NY on January 11, 1897, daughter of urban planner Edward Bassett and Annie Preston Bassett, and sister of inventor and engineer Preston Bassett. Wasson graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1918, majoring in history so she could take a wide range of science courses. She took classes in geology after graduation at the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She met her future husband, petroleum geologist Theron Wasson, whom she married in 1920, while working towards a master's degree in geology at Columbia University, which she finished in 1934. They had three children: Elizabeth W. Bergstrom, a biologist; Edward B. Wasson, a petroleum geologist; and Anne Harney Gallagher, an art historian.

Wasson became one of the first interpretive rangers hired by the National Park Service, and the second ranger and first female ranger at Yellowstone National Park.

Albright also asked her to train the hotel bellhops to give talks similar to hers, but she concluded that they lacked the background in geology to do this. She suggested instead that the park hire college students on summer break to give talks, and this became a tradition at Yellowstone and many other parks.Oral history by Wasson, recorded 1978, describes her work at Yellowstone; item 00-6 (cassette) accessdate=June 16, 2012Watry, Elizabeth A.

It is located on Bebek Bay along the European shores of the Bosphorus strait and is surrounded by similarly affluent neighbourhoods such as Arnavutk√∂y and Etiler. The literal meaning of the word \\"Bebek\\" in Turkish is \\"baby\\", which is a reference to the neighborhood's attractive positioning on the Bosphorus with its deep, sheltered bay and sweeping views in both directions along the waterway. It is believed to be a shortened form of \\"Boƒüaz'ƒ±n g√∂zbebeƒüi\\", which translates, literally, as \\"the pupil of the Bosphorus\\", or more appropriately, \\"the apple of Bosphorus' eye\\", as the literal translation of \\"pupil\\" in Turkish is \\"eye baby\\". Bebek was a popular residential district under Ottoman rule, and continues to be so today. Its population reflected the diverse society of the time, which is still visible in Bebek's historic architecture and contemporary constituencies. Bebek is also home to Boƒüazi√ßi University, a public university established that is one of Turkey's premier institutions of higher education.

It is part of his Maurai series. The novel is set several hundred years after a devastating nuclear war which has pushed back the level of technology. The action focuses on four societies: * The Northwest Union, a technological, clan-based society in the Pacific Northwest of North America * The Five Nations of the Mong, a feudal society in the center of North America, where an elite descended from post-war Russian, Chinese and Mongol invaders rules over a serf class descended from American citizens. * The Maurai Federation, an ecotopian society in the Pacific, dominated by the Maurai peoples of N'Zealann. * The Domain of Skyholm, a class-based European society located in France, the Alps, and the Low Countries dominated by an ancient pre-war dirigible aerostat. The aerostat is of the STARS type (Solar Thermal Aerostat Research Station), first described in 1980. Other nations mentioned include Angleylann, divided into small statelets including Devon, Italya, the confederation of the Alemanns in central Europe, the Zheneralship of Espanya in the Iberian peninsula, Corodo and Meyco to the south of the Northwest Union. Brief mention is made of Benghal, part of the Brahmard confederacy mentioned in other Maurai stories, and an extremely patriarchal society located in Khorasan. The novel follows a group of characters as they navigate tensions between several of the nations. The title derives from the Orion project, which one of the factions intends to resurrect. The world depicted is full of historical paradoxes and apparent anachronisms, due to unequal economic and technological development in various regions and continents, and the inability of the resource-depleted world to fully use technologies which were retained or re-discovered. * France is ruled by an English-speaking aristocracy - a precise mirror image of the situation of England after the Norman Conquest. * The Skyholm aristocrats in France are feudal lords on the ground, and at the same time fly supersonic planes in the air. * France has a feudal society like in the Middle Ages, and faces across the Rhine a Germany inhabited by barbarian tribes, as in the time of the Roman Empire. * The Maurai Federation, a powerful maritime empire presided over by a Constitutional Queen, recalls the British Empire under Queen Victoria - but the Maurai Polynesian sexual mores are the very opposite of Victorian morality. * The Northwest Union, like Weimar Germany, secretly builds weapons which were forbidden after its defeat in a previous war - and comes up with 19th Century style ironclads equipped with nuclear bombs.

The text is taken from Arthur Ransome's version of the story in the 1916 book Old Peter's Russian Tales; Ransome had collected the folktale when he was a journalist in Russia. The book was released in 1968 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and won a Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1969. Plot summary The Czar announced that whoever brought him a flying ship could marry his daughter. The Fool of the World, the youngest son of a peasant couple, set out to marry the Princess. His mother gave him \\"some crusts of dry black bread and a flask of water\\" in a bag for his trip. The Fool met an \\"ancient old man\\" who asked to eat the Fool's food. When the Fool opened his bag, he was surprised to find \\"fresh white rolls and cooked meats,\\" as well as \\"corn brandy,\\" which he shared. The old man instructed the Fool to hit a tree with his hatchet to create a flying ship, but advised him to give a ride to everyone he met. After making and flying his ship, the Fool picked up the Listener (who could hear very faint sounds), the Swift-goer (who could walk across the world in one step), the Far-shooter (who could hit a bird hundreds of miles away), the Eater (who could consume great quantities of food), the Drinker (who could swallow more than a lake at one time), a man carrying sticks of wood that could become soldiers, and a man carrying straw that could make everything cold. The eight men landed at the Czar's place. Although the Czar wanted the ship, he did not want the Princess to marry a moujik (peasant). So the Czar gave five supposedly impossible tasks to the Fool and his men: * Before the Czar had finished his dinner, he wanted \\"the magical water of life.\\" In response, the Swift-goer ran to find the water, but fell asleep. After the Listener located the Swift-goer, the Far-shooter shot a bullet close to Swift- goer's head, waking him up. The Swift-goer returned with a bottle of the water. * The Czar required the men to eat \\"twelve oxen roasted whole, and as much bread as can be baked in forty ovens.\\" The Eater considered the food \\"a little snack.\\" * The Czar commanded the men to drink 40 barrels of wine, which the Drinker gulped quickly. * The Czar demanded that the Fool take a bath in a hot iron bathhouse to prepare for the wedding. The man with the straw accompanied the Fool and spread his straw, causing the bath water to freeze. * The Czar stated that he wanted the Fool to show him \\"a regiment of soldiers\\" to defend the Princess. The man with the wood sticks scattered them around, causing a \\"gigantic army\\" to appear. Having failed in his quest to get rid of the peasants, the Czar gave the Fool gifts and asked him to marry the Princess. The Fool and the Princess fell in love with each other and were married, and the Fool \\"became so clever that all the court repeated everything he said.\\" Reception In 1968 the book was selected for Fanfare, the Horn Book Magazine list of the best books of the year. It won a Caldecott Medal in 1969. Shulevitz's illustrations for the story were praised as \\"colorful, bold, spirited, and spontaneous.\\" However, the text has been criticized because the lead character has mental retardation that is \\"unrealistic\\" in that \\"he is magically cured from his simple mindedness and becomes highly respected by the people.\\" Selected translations * Tontimundo y el Barco Volador: un Cuento Ruso (Spanish, 1991, ) * Soratobu fune to sekai ichi no baka: Roshia no mukashibanashi Ruso (Japanese, 1991) * Sesang e tul to ≈èmn≈≠n pabo wa han≈≠l ≈≠l nan≈≠n pae (Korean, 1997, ) * L'Idiot du Village et le Vaisseau Volant: un Conte Russe (French, 2011, ) ReferencesExternal links *The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship by Arthur Ransome (Project Gutenberg EBook version) Category:1968 children's books Category:Caldecott Medal-winning works Category:Children's fiction books Category:American picture books Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:Russian fairy tales ","title":"The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship (book)"},{"id":"10063156","text":"Esoteric Nazism or Esoteric Hitlerism is any of a number of mystical interpretations and adaptations of Nazism in the post‚ÄìWorld War II period. After 1945, esoteric interpretations of the Third Reich were adapted into new religious movements of white nationalism and neo-Nazism. Notable adherents=Savitri Devi French-born Greek-English writer Savitri Devi was the first major post-war exponent of what has since become known as Esoteric Hitlerism.See her \\"Hitlerian Esotericism and the Tradition\\". According to that ideology, subsequent to the fall of the Third Reich and Hitler's suicide at the end of the war, Hitler himself could be deified. Devi connected Hitler's Aryanist ideology to that of the pan-Hindu part of the Indian independence movement,See her \\"Hitlerism and Hindudom\\", originally published as \\"Hitlerism and the Hindu World\\" in The National Socialist, no. 2 (Fall 1980): 18‚Äì20. and activists such as Subhas Chandra Bose. For her, the swastika was an especially important symbol, as she felt it symbolized Aryan unity of Hindus and Germans. Savitri Devi, above all, was interested in the Indian caste system, which she regarded as the archetype of racial laws intended to govern the segregation of different races and to maintain the pure blood of the fair-complexioned Aryans. She regarded the survival of the light-skinned minority of Brahmins among an enormous population of many different Indian races after sixty centuries as a living tribute to the value of the Aryan caste system (Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, p. 92). Savitri Devi integrated Nazism into a broader cyclical framework of Hindu history. She considered Hitler to be the ninth Avatar of Vishnu, and called him \\"the god-like Individual of our times; the Man against Time; the greatest European of all times\\",From the dedication to her book, The Lightning and the Sun. having an ideal vision of returning his Aryan people to an earlier, more perfect time, and also having the practical wherewithal to fight the destructive forces \\"in Time\\". She saw his defeat‚Äîand the forestalling of his vision from coming to fruition‚Äîas a result of him being \\"too magnanimous, too trusting, too good\\", of not being merciless enough, of having in his \\"psychological make-up, too much 'sun' [beneficence] and not enough 'lightning.' [practical ruthlessness]\\",The Lightning and the Sun, unabridged edition, p. 53 unlike his coming incarnation: > \\"Kalki\\" will act with unprecedented ruthlessness. Contrarily to Adolf > Hitler, He will spare not a single one of the enemies of the divine Cause: > not a single one of its outspoken opponents but also not a single one of the > lukewarm, of the opportunists, of the ideologically heretical, of the > racially bastardised, of the unhealthy, of the hesitating, of the all-too- > human; not a single one of those who, in body or in character or mind, bear > the stamp of the fallen Ages.The Lightning and the Sun, unabridged edition, > p. 430 . Robert Charroux Unlike most ancient astronaut writers, Robert Charroux took a large interest in racialism. According to Charroux, Hyperborea was situated between Iceland and Greenland and was the home of a Nordic white race with blonde hair and blue eyes. Charroux claimed that this race was extraterrestrial in origin and had originally come from a cold planet situated far from the sun.Robbert Charroux, The Mysterious Past, Futura Publications Ltd., 1974 pp. 29‚Äì30 Charroux also claimed that the white race of the Hyperboreans and their ancestors, the Celts, had dominated the whole world in the ancient past. Some of these claims of Charroux have influenced the beliefs of Esoteric Nazism such as the work of Miguel Serrano.Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, 2003 pp. 117‚Äì118Atlantis and the Cycles of Time: Prophecies, Traditions, and Occult Revelations, Joscelyn Godwin, 2010, pp. 55‚Äì57 Miguel Serrano The next major figure in Esoteric Hitlerism is Miguel Serrano, a former Chilean diplomat. Author of numerous books including The Golden Ribbon: Esoteric Hitlerism (1978) and Adolf Hitler, the Last Avatar (1984), Serrano is one of a number of Nazi esotericists who regard the \\"Aryan blood\\" as originally extraterrestrial: > Serrano finds mythological evidence for the extraterrestrial origins of man > in the Nephilim [fallen angels] of the Book of Genesis... Serrano suggests > that the sudden appearance of Cro-Magnon Man with his high artistic and > cultural achievements in prehistoric Europe records the passage of one such > divya-descended race alongside the abysmal inferiority of Neanderthal Man, > an abomination and manifest creation of the demiurge... Of all the races on > earth, the Aryans alone preserve the memory of their divine ancestors in > their noble blood, which is still mingled with the light of the Black Sun. > All other races are the progeny of the demiurge's beast-men, native to the > planet.Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 181. Serrano supports this idea from various myths which assign divine ancestry to 'Aryan' peoples, and even the Aztec myth of Quetzalcoatl descending from Venus. He also cites the hypothesis of Bal Gangadhar Tilak on the Arctic homeland of the Indo-Aryans, as his authority for identifying the earthly centre of the Aryan migrations with the 'lost' Arctic continent of Hyperborea. Thus, Serrano's extraterrestrial gods are also identified as Hyperboreans.Serrano finds supporting evidence in, for example, the Irish legends (recorded in the Book of Invasions) which tell of divine ancestors, Tuatha D√© Danann, arriving from the northern islands; and the Greek tradition according to which Apollo returned every 19 years to Hyperborea in the far north in order to rejuvenate his body and wisdom (Goodrick-Clarke, 2003). In attempting to raise the spiritual development of the earthbound races, the Hyperborean (a Sanskrit term for god-men) suffered a tragic setback. Expanding on a story from the Book of Enoch, Serrano laments that a renegade group among the gods committed miscegenation with the terrestrial races, thus diluting the light-bearing blood of their benefactors and diminishing the level of divine awareness on the planet.Goodrick-Clarke, 2003 The concept of Hyperborea has a simultaneously racial and mystical meaning for Serrano.Jeffrey, Jason. Hyperborea & the Quest for Mystical Enlightenment, published in New Dawn No. 58 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2000). Online: He believes that Hitler was in Shambhala, an underground centre in Antarctica (formerly at the North Pole and Tibet), where he was in contact with the Hyperborean gods and whence he would someday emerge with a fleet of UFOs to lead the forces of light (the Hyperboreans, sometimes associated with Vril) over the forces of darkness (inevitably including, for Serrano, the Jews who follow Jehovah) in a last battle and thus inaugurating a Fourth Reich. thumbrightThe \\"Black Sun\\" emblem, representing the celestial homeland of the Hyperboreans and the invisible source of their energy, according to Serrano. Serrano, however, has not identified the Black Sun with the above ornament in the Wewelsburg. (According to Nicholas Goodrick-ClarkeGoodrick-Clarke 2003: 182.) > Serrano follows the Gnostic tradition of the Cathars (fl. 1025‚Äì1244) by > identifying the evil demiurge as Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament. As > medieval dualists, these eleventh-century heretics had repudiated Jehovah as > a false god and mere artificer opposed to the real God far beyond our > earthly realm. This Gnostic doctrine clearly carried dangerous implications > for the Jews. As Jehovah was the tribal deity of the Jews, it followed that > they were devil worshipers. By casting the Jews in the role of the children > of Satan, the Cathar heresy can elevate anti-Semitism to the status of a > theological doctrine backed by a vast cosmology. If the Hyperborean Aryans > are the archetype and blood descendents of Serrano's divyas from the Black > Sun, then the archetype of the Lord of Darkness needed a counter-race. The > demiurge sought and found the most fitting agent for its archetype in the > Jews. As religious scholars Frederick C. Grant and Hyam Maccoby emphasize, in the view of the dualist Gnostics, \\"Jews were regarded as the special people of the Demiurge and as having the special historical role of obstructing the redemptive work of the High God's emissaries\\".Collier's Encyclopedia Vol. 11, 1997: 166. Serrano thus considered Hitler as one of the greatest emissaries of this High God, rejected and crucified by the tyranny of the Judaicized rabble like previous revolutionary light-bringers. Serrano had a special place in his ideology for the SS, who, in their quest to recreate the ancient race of Aryan god-men, he thought were above morality and therefore justified, after the example of the anti-humanitarian \\"detached violence\\" taught in the Aryo-Hindu tradition. David Myatt In the 1980s and 1990s David Myatt developed an interpretation, or revisionist version,Searchlight, July 2000. of Nazism which although based on Savitri Devi's three principles of \\"above\\", \\"against\\", and \\"in time\\" individuals Savitri Devi, The Lightning and the Sun, 1958. did not involve either ancient mythology or extraterrestrial beings. Instead Myatt, described as \\"most commonly associated with the occult wing of the National Socialist movement,Jeffrey Kaplan (editor). Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000. p.216. focused - in pamphlets such as The Meaning of National Socialism , The Enlightenment of National Socialism and his The Religion of National Socialism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, NYU Press, 2003. p. 343. on what he described as \\"the numinous\\" aspects of Nazism with Jeffrey Kaplan writing that Myatt described Nazism as \\"unambiguously a religion while Adolf Hitler is treated unashamedly as the saviour of mankind.\\" Collective Aryan unconscious In the book Black Sun, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke reports how Carl Gustav Jung described \\"Hitler as possessed by the archetype of the collective Aryan unconscious and could not help obeying the commands of an inner voice\\". In a series of interviews between 1936 and 1939, Jung characterized Hitler as an archetype, often manifesting itself to the complete exclusion of his own personality. Hitler is a spiritual vessel, a demi-divinity; even better, a myth. Benito Mussolini is a man' ... the messiah of Germany who teaches the virtue of the sword. 'The voice he hears is that of the collective unconscious of his race.Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 178 Jung's suggestion that Hitler personified the collective Aryan unconscious deeply interested and influenced Miguel Serrano, who later concluded that Jung was merely psychologizing the ancient, sacred mystery of archetypal possession by the gods, independent metaphysical powers that rule over their respective races and occasionally possess their members.Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 179 Conspiracy theories and pseudoscience The writings of Miguel Serrano, Savitri Devi, and other proponents of Esoteric Nazism have spawned numerous later works connecting Aryan master race beliefs and Nazi escape scenarios with enduring conspiracy theories about hollow earth civilizations and shadowy new world orders. Since 1945, neo-Nazi writers have also proposed Shambhala and the star Aldebaran as the original homeland of the Aryans. The book Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival, by Hypnerotomachia Poliphili scholar Joscelyn Godwin, discusses pseudoscientific theories about surviving Nazi elements in Antarctica. Arktos is noted for its scholarly approach and examination of many sources currently unavailable elsewhere in English- language translations. Godwin and other authors such as Nicholas Goodrick- Clarke have discussed the connections between Esoteric Nazism and Vril energy, the hidden Shambhala and Agartha civilizations, and underground UFO bases, as well as Hitler's and the SS's supposed survival in underground Antarctic oases in New Swabia or in alliance with Hyperboreans from the subterranean world.Godwin 1996, ch. 5‚Äì6, 10; Goodrick-Clarke 2002, especially ch. 6‚Äì9. Relationship to neopaganism Organisations such as the Armanen-Orden represent significant developments of neo-pagan esotericism and Ariosophy after World War II, but they do not all constitute forms of Nazi esotericism. Some northern European neopagan groups, such as Theods, √Åsatr√∫arf√©lagi√∞ and Vi√∞artr√∫ar, have explicitly stated that neo-Nazism is not common among their members. On the other hand, there are neopagan organisations with close ties to neo-Nazism, such as the Artgemeinschaft or the Heathen Front, and the attraction of many neo-Nazis to Germanic paganism remains an issue particularly in Germany (see Nornirs √Ütt). Music There is a contemporary loose network of small musical groups that combine neo-fascism and satanism. These groups can be found in Britain, France, and New Zealand, under names such as \\"Black Order\\" or \\"Infernal Alliance\\", and draw their inspiration from the Esoteric Hitlerism of Miguel Serrano.Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 106, 213‚Äì231. These groups advocate the anti-modern neo-tribalism and \\"Traditionalism\\" found in the \\"pagan\\" mysticist ideals of Alain de Benoist's Nouvelle Droite inspired by Julius Evola. Esoteric themes, including references to artifacts such as the Holy Lance, are also often alluded to in neo-Nazi music (e.g. Rock Against Communism) and above all in National Socialist black metal.Neo-Nazi Hate Music: A Guide See also * Atomwaffen Division * Kerry Bolton * Cosmotheism * The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century * German Christians (movement) * Landig Group * James Mason (neo-Nazi) * Nazi UFOs * Nazis: The Occult Conspiracy * Nazism and occultism * Positive Christianity * Race of Jesus * Religion in Nazi Germany * Religious views of Adolf Hitler * Religious aspects of Nazism * Thule Society * Fascist mysticism References Notes Bibliography * Dohe, Carrie B.

Process artists saw art as pure human expression. Process art defends the idea that the process of creating the work of art can be an art piece itself. Artist Robert Morris predicated ‚Äúanti-form‚Äù, process and time over an objectual finished product. Movement Process art has been entitled as a creative movement in the US and Europe in the mid-1960s. It has roots in Performance Art, the Dada movement and, more traditionally, the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock, and in its employment of serendipity. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The Guggenheim Museum states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states: > Process Artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random > occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional > materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric > forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as > cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, > condensation, freezing, or decomposition.Source: (accessed: Thursday, March > 15, 2007) The ephemeral nature and insubstantiality of materials was often showcased and highlighted, as is demonstrated in this review of William Basinski and his work titled The Disintegration Loops I-IV by Joe Tangari for Pitchfork Media: > You are slowly being destroyed. It's imperceptible in the scheme of a day or > a week or even a year, but you are aging, and your body is degrading. As > your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to live, they also > release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and > cause you to grow progressively less able to perform as you did at your > peak. By the time you reach 80, you will literally be full of holes, and > though you'll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel > their collective effect. Aging and degradation are forces of nature, > functions of living, and understanding them can be as terrifying as it is > gratifying. It's not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think > William Basinski's Disintegration Loops are a step toward that > understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this force > of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical > matter, made manifest in music. During the summer of 2001, William Basinski > set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops he'd had in > storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of > preservation began to devour the tapes he was saving. As they played, flakes > of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head, wiping out > portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as > they progressed, the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the > destruction of Basinski's old music. In essence, Basinski is improvising > using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the > result is the most amazing piece of processmusic I've ever heard, an > encompassing soundworld as lulling as it is apocalyptic.Source: > http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/ > (accessed: Saturday, February 16, 2013) The process art movement and the environmental art movement are directly related: > Process Artists engage the primacy of organic systems, using perishable, > insubstantial, and transitory materials such as dead rabbits, steam, fat, > ice, cereal, sawdust, and grass. The materials are often left exposed to > natural forces: gravity, time, weather, temperature, etc.Source: > http://www.artandculture.com/cgi- > bin/WebObjects/ACLive.woa/wa/movement?id=1037 (accessed: Thursday, March 15, > 2007) In process art, as in the Arte Povera movement, nature itself is lauded as art; the symbolization and representation of nature, often rejected. Antecedent The process art movement has precedent in indigenous rites, shamanic and religious rituals, cultural forms such as sandpainting, sun dance, and the tea ceremony are fundamentally related pursuits. Aspects of the process of the construction of a Vajrayana Buddhist sand mandala (a subset of sandpainting) of Medicine Buddha by monks from Namgyal Monastery in Ithaca, New York that began February 26, 2001 and concluded March 21, 2001 has been captured and web-exhibitedSource: http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/construction.htm (accessed: Monday, December 22, 2008) by the Ackland's Yager Gallery of Asian Art. The dissolution of the mandala was on June 8, 2001. Relationship to other disciplines and movements Process art shares fundamental features with a number of other fields, including the expressive therapies and transformative arts, both of which pivot around how the creative process of engaging in artistic activities can precipitate personal insight, individual healing, and social change, independent of the perceived value attributed to the object of creation. Additionally, process art is integral to arts-based research, which uses creative process and artistic expression to investigate subjects that resist description or representation through other modes of inquiry.Barone, T. and Eisner, E., Arts Based Research. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA: Sage, (2012). McNiff, S., Art-Based Research. London, UK: Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1998.  Artists  The maximum exponents of process art are Abel Azcona, Lynda Benglis, Joseph Beuys, Chris Drury, Eva Hesse, Gary Kuehn, Barry Le Va, Bruce Nauman, Robert Morris, Richard Serra, Keith Sonnier, Aida Tomescu and Richard Van Buren.

It is used to designate a politician as a liberal, yet independent of the official Liberal Party of a country. Those parties were the Liberal Party of Canada, or the Liberal Party of the United Kingdom, or the New Zealand Liberal Party. Canada Independent Liberal Members of Parliament (or of the Canadian Senate or a provincial legislative assembly) are typically former Liberal caucus members who were either expelled from the Liberal Party caucus or resigned the whip due to a political disagreement. More recent examples, include Don Johnston who sat as an Independent Liberal from January 18, 1988 until the adjournment of parliament due to his resignation from the Liberal caucus as a result of his support of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement which the party opposed, Jag Bhaduria who sat as an Independent Liberal from 1994 to 1996 following his expulsion from the Liberal caucus and Dennis Mills who briefly left the Liberal caucus in 1996 to sit as an \\"Independent Liberal\\" to protest the Liberal government's failure to abolish the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Independent Liberal candidates for parliament or the legislature have been those who generally subscribe to Liberal Party principles but either have not been selected as an official Liberal Party candidate or decline to seek the party's nomination due to a disagreement with the party on certain issues. Under the current Elections Act a candidate who is not affiliated with a political party can only describe themselves on the ballot as Independent or \\"No Affiliation\\" and cannot describe themselves in terms of an existing political party. Accordingly, no candidate for the House of Commons of Canada has officially designated themselves an \\"Independent Liberal\\" since the 1968 federal election and no Independent Liberal candidate has been elected to the House of Commons since the 1957 federal election. A number of Quebec Liberal MPs left the party and sat as Independent Liberals as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1944 as they opposed the Liberal government's decision to implement conscription. The most prominent of these was Charles Gavan Power who resigned from Cabinet over the issue. Several ran for re-election in the 1945 federal election as Independent Liberals. William Lyon Mackenzie King's government was returned with only a minority of Liberal MPs in parliament but was able to govern as a majority government with the support of Independent Liberal MPs, most of whom rejoined the party in the course of the parliament. United Kingdom Independent Liberal is a description once used in British politics to denote a form of non-party affiliation. It was used to designate a politician as a Liberal who was independent of any political party, particularly of the Liberal Party before its transformation in the 1980s into the Liberal Democrats. Since the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 came into force, a candidate for election can no longer be described as an \\"Independent Liberal\\" on a ballot paper, as the 1998 Act prohibits any description which could cause confusion with a registered political party. In practice, the description used is either the name of a registered party or the word \\"Independent\\". New Zealand Independent Liberal was a definition in New Zealand politics in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries for Independents that aligned themselves with the New Zealand Liberal Party. It is often difficult to determine whether candidates were official Liberal or Independent Liberal and many electorates had more Liberal candidates standing than seats available. From to the New Zealand Liberal Party was the only formalised political party to win any seats in parliament.

A member of the extensive Huey family, it first flew in 1969. The CUH-1N Twin Huey (later CH-135 Twin Huey) was the original version, first ordered by the Canadian Forces. The UH-1N has a 15-seat configuration, with one pilot and 14 passengers. In cargo configuration, it has an internal capacity of 220 ft¬≥ (6.23 m¬≥). An external load up to 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) can be carried. The UH-1N was later developed into the civilian Bell 212. Development Based on the stretched-fuselage Bell 205, the Bell 212 was originally developed for the Canadian Forces (CF) under the designation CUH-1N Twin Huey. Later, the CF adopted a new designation system and the aircraft was redesignated CH-135 Twin Huey. The CF approved the development of the aircraft on 1 May 1968Mutza 1986, pp. 31-33. and purchased 50 aircraft, with deliveries commencing in May 1971.Drendel 1983, pp. 14-17. 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron, 1985 The US military came very close to not procuring the Twin Huey. The purchase of the aircraft for US military use was opposed by the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee at the time, L. Mendel Rivers. Rivers took this position because the aircraft powerplant, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6T was produced in Canada. The Liberal Canadian government of the time had not supported US involvement in Vietnam and had opposed US policies in Southeast Asia, as well as accepting US draft dodgers. Rivers was also concerned that procurement of the engines would result in a trade deficit situation with Canada. Congress only approved the purchase when it was assured that a US source would be found for the PT6T/T400 engines. As a result, the United States military services ordered 294 Bell 212s under the designation UH-1N, with deliveries commencing in 1970. Unlike in the CF, in US service, the UH-1N retained the official name \\"Iroquois\\" from the single‚Äìengined UH-1 variants, although US service personnel refer to the aircraft as a \\"Huey\\" or \\"Twin Huey\\".Drendel 1983, p. 9. The Bell 412 is a further development of the Bell 212, the major difference being the composite, four-blade main rotor. The UH-1N has also been developed into the upgraded, four-blade UH-1Y.Eden 2004, p. 47. Design The UH-1N's main rotor is powered by a PT6T-3/T400 Turbo Twin Pac made up of two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 power sections that drive a single output shaft. They are capable of producing up to 1,342 kW (1,800 shp). Should one power section fail, the remaining section can deliver 671 kW (900 shp) for 30 minutes or 571 kW (765 shp), enabling the UH-1N to maintain cruise performance at maximum weight. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) modified a large number of their UH-1Ns with a stability control augmentation system, which provides servo inputs to the rotor head to help stabilize the aircraft during flight. This modification removed the gyroscopic \\"stabilization bar\\" on top of the main rotor head, instead relying on the computer system for stability. Operational history A USAF UH-1N during Exercise Wounded Eagle '83 From late 1970, the UH-1N re-equipped the USAF 20th Special Operations Squadron in Vietnam, replacing the single-engined UH-1F and UH-1P. Armed with miniguns (or 40 mm grenade launchers) and rocket pods, and painted camouflage with no US markings and only a Green Hornet insignia, the UH-1N supported Special Forces reconnaissance missions from Cam Ranh Bay.Mutza Air Enthusiast December 1986‚ÄìApril 1987, pp. 30‚Äì31. The United States Air Force employs UH-1Ns to fulfill its ICBM mission, providing a utility helicopter for transport between bases such as Minot AFB, Francis E. Warren AFB and Malmstrom AFB to missile launch sites in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado. The UH-1N is also used by the 36th Rescue Squadron (36 RQS) at Fairchild AFB, Washington, for conducting search-and-rescue and medical evacuation missions, as well as the 459th Airlift Squadron based at Yokota Air Base in Japan. During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentine Air Force deployed two Bell 212s to Goose Green grass airstrip from where they performed general support duties including the recovery of many downed pilots. By the end of the hostilities, both aircraft were still intact, but were dismantled by the Argentinians.FAA official magazine UH-1Ns were used by the USMC during its 2003 invasion of Iraq. UH-1Ns provided reconnaissance and communications support to Marine ground troops. They were also called upon to provide close air support during heavy fighting in Nasiriyah.Stout, Jay A. Hammer from Above, Marine Air Combat Over Iraq. Ballantine Books, 2005. . In August 2013, the Air Force said they were close to finalizing a plan to sustain and modernize their UH-1Ns for the next six to 10 years. The plan was to sustain the fleet, address flight and safety mandates, investigate modest improvements in capabilities, and reduce capability gaps. While the Huey is one of the oldest platforms in the service, keeping the fleet going was seen as having \\"minimal risk\\". Fleet-wide upgrades included night vision-compatible cockpit lighting, crash-worthy seats for flight engineers, and installation of a helicopter terrain-awareness warning system and traffic collision-avoidance device. The Air Force was also in the process of further acquiring ex-Marine Corps UH-1N models. The Marines were working out a strategy to transfer as many as 26 helicopters to the Air Force to either add them to their active fleet or keep them in reserve.Air Force planning decade-long Huey extension - Militarytimes.com, 22 August 2013 The UH-1N has seen combat service in the Colombian armed conflict. On 16 October 2013, a UH-1N helicopter crashed in the northern La Guajira department. The zone of the crash is a hotbed of FARC rebel activity. A Marine UH-1N on the flight line at NAS Whiting Field, Florida, 1982 The USMC planned to retire the UH-1N Iroquois by September 2014 after 43 years of service. Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 773 was the last Marine squadron operating them, with their last deployment occurring in 2013, when two helicopters sailed on a Royal Netherlands Navy ship for an African Partnership Station deployment. Deliveries began to the Navy and Marine Corps in 1971, totaling 205 UH-1Ns and six VH-1N executive transports for Marine Helicopter Squadron One. The UH-1N was replaced by the upgraded UH-1Y Venom; 10 are remanufactured N-model airframes, after which the Marines decided to procure newly built Y-model airframes. Five unarmed HH-1N versions remained in use by the Marines until they were also replaced by UH-1Ys and retired in 2015, the only HH-1Ns remaining from 44 that were converted from 38 UH-1Ns and the six VH-1Ns.Marine Corps to Retire UH-1N Helicopters in September; HH-1Ns in 2015 - Seapowermagazine.org, 4 August 2014 The last combat deployment of the UH-1N by the Marines was to Afghanistan in 2010.

Since most were purchased in 1969, the Air Force had sought a replacement.UH-72 Lakota Could Be a Candidate for Air Force Duty - Defensemedianetwork.com, 10 March 2013 The first requirements were issued in 2007, but the process was repeatedly delayed. On 24 September 2018, the Air Force declared a Boeing/Leonardo submission of their MH-139 version of the AgustaWestland AW139 the winner, beating out the Sikorsky/Lockheed Martin HH-60U version of the UH-60 Black Hawk and the Sierra Nevada Corporation upgraded UH-60L called the Force Hawk.

They are a typical phenomenon in the polar and subpolar zone of discontinuous permafrost. One of their characteristics is having steep slopes that rises above the mire surface. This leads to the accumulation of large amounts of snow around them. The summits of the palsas are free of snow even in winter, because the wind carries the snow and deposits on the slopes and elsewhere on the flat mire surface. Palsas can be up to 150 m in diameter and can reach a height of 12 m. Permafrost is found on palsa mires only in the palsas themselves, and its formation is based on the physical properties of peat. Dry peat is a good insulator, but wet peat conducts heat better, and frozen peat is even better at conducting heat. This means that cold can penetrate deep into the peat layers, and that heat can easily flow from deeper wet layers in winter. Whereas the dry peat on the palsa surface insulates the frozen core and prevents it from thawing in the summer. This means that palsas can survive in a climate where the mean annual temperature is just below the freezing point. A lithalsa is a palsa without peat cover. They exist in a smaller range than palsas, commonly occurring in oceanic climate regimes. However both palsas and lithalsas are relatively small compared to pingos; typically less than 3 m. Palsa development Palsas may be initiated in areas of a moor or bog where the winter freezing front penetrates relatively faster than surrounding areas, perhaps due to an unusually thin cover of snow. The lack of thermal insulation provided by thick snow permits much deeper freezing in winter. This ice may then last through the summer with a persistent 'bump' of up to several cm due to frost heave. The elevated surface of a palsa will tend also to have thinner snow cover, allowing greater winter cooling, while in summer the surface material (especially if organic) will dry out and provide thermal insulation. Thus the interior temperature is consistently lower than that of adjacent ground. This contributes to the formation of an ice lens which grows by drawing up surrounding water. The expansion of the ice upon freezing exerts pressure on the surrounding soil, further forcing water out of its pore spaces which then accumulates on and increases the volume of the growing ice lens. A positive feedback loop develops. Changes in surface moisture and vegetation will then be such as to preserve the newly formed permafrost. The overlying soil layer is gradually lifted up by frost heaving. In cross-section, the ice cores of a palsa show layering, which is caused by the successive winter freezing intervals. The pressing out of water from the pores is not crucial, however, since the boggy soil is water-saturated and thus always provides enough water for ice core growth. Many scientists agree that the development of a palsa is cyclic were growth continues until a convex form of the palsa is reached. When this occurs an increasing pressure in the uppermost layer of peat will cause cracks in the peat layer which will result in the sliding of the peat layer toward the sides of the palsa. As this layer of peat generates an insulating effect the regression of the layer will thereby expose the permafrost in the palsa and initiate melting. In this case, the melting of the palsa is a normal part of the cyclic development and, it will be possible for new embryonic palsa forms to develop in the same area. However, the studies done on palsa forms has primarily been observing dome palsas in the northern regions. These study areas lie within the core area for palsa occurrences and therefore are the cyclic development applicable only to dome palsas within in the core area. Palsa plateaus, often lack the convex form which causes cracks in the peat layers and the decay of dome palsas. But in palsa plateaus, frost expansion which causes swelling will with time create an uneven surface and increase the possibility for water accumulation on the surface and cause local regression and melting. This process, which causes melting likewise the cracking of the peat layer in dome palsas, is a normal part in the life span of palsa plateaus but are not a part of a cyclic evolvement. Palsas appear to go through a developmental cycle that eventually leads to thawing and collapse. Open cracks that commonly accompany palsa growth and the water that tends to accumulate around palsas, probably as a result of their weight depressing the adjacent bog surface, are important factors in this process. The fact that palsas in various stages of growth and decay occur together shows that their collapse is not necessarily indicative of climatic change. All that is usually left after a palsa collapses is a depression surrounded by a rim. Morphology The Storflaket peat bog near Abisko in northern Sweden is a permafrost plateau. It shows some signs of collapse such as cracks at its borders One specific type of mire at which palsa structures appear is called a palsa mire. But, sometimes the nature type is described as palsa bogs, however, they both refer to a peaty wetland where palsa mounds occur. In palsa mires, palsas which are in different stages of development can appear due to the cyclic development of the structure.Per Wramner, Susanne Backe, Kjell Wester, Thomas Hedvall, Urban Gunnarsson, Saad Alsam och Wenche Eide (2012). \\"F√∂rslag till √∂vervakningsprogram f√∂r Sveriges palsmyrar\\". L√§nsstyrelsens rapportserie. 16/2012: p. 65-72. Therefore, the collapsed form of the palsas are common in these areas which can be seen as rounded ponds, open peat surfaces or low circular rim ridges. The individual palsa is described as a mound or a larger elevation in peatland with a core of permanently frozen peat and/or mineral soil with an uppermost active layer of peat. The structure occurs in areas with discontinuous permafrost but the core stays frozen permanently, including summertime, as the peat layer creates an insulating effect. Mostly palsas have an oval or elongated form but different shapes of palsas have been described. In some places (Laivadalen and Keinovuopio in northern Sweden), palsa complexes which consist of several dome-shaped palsas have been found. At other places (Seitajaure in northern Sweden), another palsa structure is described. Here several palsa-plateaus have been found which have flatter surfaces and steep edges. Palsa forms include mounds, moderately straight ridges, and winding ridges. Palsas in Iceland have been described as hump-shaped, dike-shaped, plateau-shaped, ring-shaped, and shield-shaped. Those in Norway have been referred to as palsa plateaus, esker palsas, string palsas, conical or dome-shaped palsas, and palsa complexes. Widths are commonly 10‚Äì30 m, and lengths 15‚Äì150 m. However, lengths of up to 500 m have been reported for esker-like palsa ridges running parallel to the gradient of a bog. Heights range from less than 1 m up to 6‚Äì7 meters, but can reach about 10 m at a maximum above the surrounding area. Large forms tend to be considerably less conical than small ones. In places, palsas combine to form complexes several hundred meters in extent. The permafrost core contains ice lenses no thicker than 2‚Äì3 cm, though locally lenses up to almost 40 cm thick have been described. During the cyclic development, the palsa goes through several stages at which the morphology differs. In the initial aggrading stage of development, the palsas have smooth surfaces with no cracks in the peat layer and no visible signs of erosion can be seen. They are often small and dome-shaped and often referred to as embryo palsas. In this stage ice layers are created which are commonly found in the frozen peat core. It has been suggested that these ice layers are created by ice segregation but, it is most certainly buoyancy that is the reason for the formation of the ice layers. Buoyant rise of the core occurs which freezes when the permafrost reaches the area and creates the ice layers. In the stable, mature phase, the surface has risen further to a level at which the snow cover during winter is thinned by the wind which in turn makes it possible for deeper freezing. In the mature stage, the frozen core has reached beyond the peat layer into the underlying silty sediments and during summer thawing of the core occurs but not to an extent where the core thaws completely. The thawing can sometimes create water filled ponds adjacent to the palsa and in some cases cracks in the peat layer along these ponds can be present in the stable stage. However, these cracks are small in size and no visible signs of block erosion are seen during the sable stage. During the degrading stage, however, the palsas have large cracks up to several meters which divide the peat layer into blocks and so called block erosion occurs. Adjacent to palsas in the degrading stage often several individual ponds are found, due to thawing of the frozen core. Wind erosion often affect the peat layer to such a degree that it decreases in thickness with sometimes several decimeters. When palsa plateaus are in the degrading stage several ponds on the flat plateau-surface can be seen which often have neighbouring block erosion. When block erosion occurs the mineral soil is often exposed along the cracks, especially when the peat layer is thin. Geographic distribution Anders Rapp's map of the limit of palsas and discontinuous permafrost in Fennoscandia. Palsas are typical forms of the discontinuous permafrost zone regions and are therefore found in Subarctic regions of northern Canada and Alaska, Siberia, northern Fennoscandia and Iceland. They are almost exclusively associated with bogs and commonly occur in areas where the winters are long and the snow cover tends to be thin. In some places palsas extend into underlying permafrost; in others they rest on an unfrozen substratum. In the southern hemisphere palsa remains from the last glacial maximum have been identified on the Argentine side of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego just north of Cami Lake. Remainders of Ice-Age palsas are to be found also in Hochmooren of Central Europe, such as Hohen Venn in the German-Belgian border area.  Effects of climate change = Effect on palsa forms due to change in climatic conditions  Erosion of palsa forms and the receding of the permafrost in the core of the palsa does not directly indicate a change in climatic conditions. As the palsas have a cyclic development the thawing of the core is a normal part of the palsa development. However, change in climatic conditions does effect palsa forms. The palsa forms that lay in the outskirt of the occurrence area are more dependent on climatic conditions for existence than the palsa forms near the core of the occurrence area. A study on palsa forms was done in 1998 at Dovrefjell, in southern Norway. At the time of observation the mean annual temperature lied just under 0 ¬∞C in the area. These areas are certainly sensitive to changes in temperature were just a small temperature rise can have a great effect on the lasting existence of palsas in the specific region. Measurements from meteorological stations in the area show that the mean annual temperature raised 0.8 ¬∞C between the time periods of 1901-1930 and 1961‚Äì1990. Since the start of the warming trend, in the 1930s, entire palsa bogs and large palsa plateaus has completely melted in the Dovrefjell area. Palsa bogs sensitivity to changes in temperature makes them a good climate indicator.Using indicators to explain our changing climate to policymakers and the public WMO The study in the Dovrefjell area concluded that if palsas are used as climate indicators it is essential to separate large changes in the distribution of permafrost from smaller changes. Smaller changes are caused by shorter climatic variations which only last a few years. Small dome palsas, which also can be called embryo palsas, can develop as a result of smaller variations in climatic conditions such as a few following cold winters. As these small palsas disappear just after a few years they fail to establish as permanent formations. This phenomenon has been observed in the Dovrefjell in the last decades and is caused by a larger change in the climatic condition where the temperature has risen to a level at which the palsas can't fully initiate their cyclic development. This is a consequence of climate change with the warming trend which has been observed in the Dovrefjell area. In this area, the climate has not been cold enough for new palsa forms to establish during the whole of the 20th century. However, some uncertainties of how the local conditions affect the formation of palsa forms and especially the hydrology of palsa mires still exist. Additionally, more active-layer monitoring and it's correlation to local weather conditions is needed to better determine the effect of climate change on palsa mires.  Palsa and GHG-fluxes  Because the top mounds of the palsa is more dry and nutrient poor than its wet surroundings, they create a mosaic of microhabitats within the mire. The occurrence of palsa is determined by several climatological factors, such as air temperature, precipitation and snow thickness. Therefore, an increase in temperature and precipitation may induce thawing of frozen peat and subsidence of the peat surface. This resulting in a thicker active layer and wetter conditions. The vegetation therefore changes in adaptation to the wetter conditions. The expanding wetness is projected to benefit sphagnum mosses and graminoids, at the expense of the dryer palsa vegetation. The associated changes in greenhouse gases fluxes is increased CO2 uptake and increased methane emission, mainly due to the expansion of tall graminoids.  The continued occurrence of palsa mires in Fennoscandia  The lasting occurrence of palsa mires is endangered by several factors. Firstly, one factor is climate change which primarily causes a treat to the palsa mires located at the outskirt of the habitat distribution. Climate change causes an increase in the average annual temperature which must lay under 0 ¬∞C for palsa forms to exist. Additionally, climate change also causes a change in precipitation with increasing snowfall in the occurrence area for palsa mires which also will have a negative effect on the palsa mires. Another factor is particles from atmospheric fallout which can influence the hydrochemistry and degradation rate of organic matter. Furthermore, community building and primarily such that have an impact on the hydrology and hydrochemistry can damage the habitat of palsa mires. But, the impact from this kind of activity is minimal considering the extent of the occurrence area which is relatively large compared to the impacted area. Palsa mires are a prioritized habitat type in EU's Species and Habitats Directive and therefore conservation of palsa mires within Sweden and Finland is of great interest. Conservation of this habitat can be fulfilled with measures of such kind that they sustain a favourable conservation status and degradation of the palsa mires are avoided. Another important aspect for the conservation of palsa mires is a continued work against climate change. But, in 2013 Sweden reported the conservation status for the palsa mires to be poor and in many areas the palsas have collapsed and there's a high risk for extinction. Many studies report degradation of the habitat type during the last decades with the primary cause for the loss of habitat area being climate change.  Effects on ecosystems and species  A typical palsa mire has a high level of biodiversity, ranging from several different types of bird species to tiny organisms like bacteria. This is largely because of particularly due to its outstanding minerotrophic- ombrotrophic and water table gradients, which enables the presence of several microhabitats distributed in different degrees of wetness. Palsa mires are listed as a priority habitat type by the European Union, and climate change may pose a great risk to its ecosystems. Although much research has been carried out on degradation of palsa mires, there is still an enormous information gap on what implications on biodiversity disruptions in ecosystems may have. In fact, there is not much at all known about many organisms inhabiting palsas. It is vital to gain more knowledge about the distribution of these organisms, as well as patterns of species richness long-term, in order to understand and predict possible implications of potential loss of palsa. Without this key knowledge, understanding the biological importance of palsa mires is hard to assess. In palsa mire zones in Northern Europe, abundance of bird species breeding finds it peak. This is particularly true in the case of North European waders. In the northernmost of Finland, palsa mires host the highest bird species density of all compared to several different biotopes, and there are most likely the heterogeneity of habitats and availability of shallow waters (a basic source of food) that creates such a massive diversity of birds. Due to likely loss of palsa mires in this century, effects on wildlife and biodiversity is undeniable. Shallow waters might disappear or decrease dramatically, creating a more homogenous environment. This will likely have a negative impact on certain species of breeding birds as well as other organisms inhabiting palsa mires permanently or seasonally. It must be noted that the available research on ecological effects of palsa regression is scarce. As many breeding species are not exclusive to palsa mires, the question of possible extinction as a result of declining palsa mires are yet not certain. It is not a reach though, to suggest that the homogenization of palsa mires will bring biological consequences. There are some (however few) studies conducted on the ecological factors responsible for species abundance, in which water table depth is a suggested factor. To successfully conduct a comprehensive study on biodiversity effects in this area, much more research is needed to map out a lot of species living in palsa areas. Differences and commonalities between pingos and palsas Both palsas and pingos are perennial frost mounds; however pingos are typically larger than palsas and can reach heights greater than 50 m. Palsas does not have an intrusive ice core, or ice that forms as a result of local groundwater. However, for pingos, the defining characteristics is the presence of intrusive ice throughout most of the core. Palsas form as a result of ice-lens accumulation by cryosuction, and pingos as the result of hydraulic pressure if its open, and hydrostatic pressure if its closed. Moreover, contrary to pingos which are usually isolated, palsas usually arise in groups with other palsas, such as in a so-called palsa bog. Unlike pingos, palsas do not require surrounding permafrost to grow, seeing as palsa are permafrost. Pingos also grow below the active layer, which is the depth that the annual freeze-thaw cycle occurs, and palsa grow in the active layer. Both palsas and pingos result from freezing of water to an ice core. Palsas, however, do not necessarily require positive hydrostatic pressure (to inject water), since the boggy soil is water-saturated and therefore has sufficient supply for the growing ice core. Terminology and synonyms Palsa (plural: palsas) is a term from the Finnish language meaning \\"a hummock rising out of a bog with a core of ice,\\" which in turn is a borrowing from Northern Sami, balsa. As palsas particularly develop in moorlands, they are therefore also named palsamoors. Bugor and bulginniakhs are general terms in the Russian language (the latter of Yakutian origin) for both palsas and pingos.

History The office of coroner in New South Wales derives from the legal framework inherited from the United Kingdom. The first Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, was a coroner by virtue of his commission as governor. Similarly, Lieutenant Governors of Western Australia also had similar powers. The governor's commission also entitled him to appoint others as coroners as required, and this was most likely to have been to justices of the peace. In the 2000s the processes of the court were reviewed. The first female appointee to the role of State Coroner was Ros Fogliani in 2014. Trove outline of Fogliani's career - at https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1707722?c=people She also oversaw significant cases related to deaths in 2017 relating to aboriginal suicides. Structure and Jurisdiction Coroners have the power to investigate the causes of death within their jurisdiction. They also have power to retain a person‚Äôs remains, order autopsies, and direct how a person‚Äôs remains may be disposed. Unlike coroners in other states, Western Australian coroners do not have jurisdiction to hold inquiries concerning the cause of any fire in the state. Where a serious criminal offence has been disclosed during the course of an inquest or an inquiry, the Coroner may refer that matter to the Western Australian Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of the institution of criminal proceedings. Generally there are no appeals from the decision of a coroner, although there may be provision for the Supreme Court of Western Australia to grant prerogative relief in respect of the proceedings. State Coroner The Governor of Western Australia on the advice of the Attorney-General of Western Australia may appoint a State Coroner for Western Australia. The State Coroner has the function to oversee and co-ordinate coronial services in Western Australia, ensure that all deaths and suspected deaths concerning which a coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest are properly investigated, and ensuring that an inquest is held whenever it is required, and to issue guidelines to coroners to assist them in the exercise or performance of their functions. The Governor on the recommendation of the Attorney General may also appoint a Deputy State Coroner. Deputy State Coroners may exercise any of the functions of the State Coroner delegated by the State Coroner to them. The Governor may also appoint Coroners and Coroner‚Äôs Registrars. All coroners in Western Australia are magistrates by virtue of their appointment as a coroner.

Shirley himself considered The Imposture the best of his romantic comedies.Emile Legouis and Louis Cazamian, A History of English Literature, translated by W. D. MacInnes and Helen Douglas-Irvine; New York, MacMillan, 1926; p. 328. The Imposture was licensed for performance (as The Imposter) by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 10 November 1640. It was acted at the Blackfriars Theatre by the King's Men, the company for which Shirley wrote in the 1640-2 era. The play was published by booksellers Humphrey Moseley and Humphrey Robinson in the octavo collection of Shirley's works titled Six New Plays (1653).In Six New Plays, five of the dramas are dated 1652 while the sixth and the general title page are dated 1653 -- an ambiguity that has caused confusion in scholarly sources. In that edition, the Prologue of the play states that Shirley \\"has been stranger long to the English scene\\" -- referring to Shirley's stay in Dublin at the Werburgh Street Theatre from 1636 to 1640. This may indicate that The Imposture was the first of Shirley's plays acted after his return from Ireland. Shirley dedicated the play to Sir Robert Bolles. Synopsis Flaviano is the courtly favorite of the Duke of Mantua; he desires to marry the Duke's daughter Fioretta. She, however, has been promised to Prince Leonato of Ferrara, who has brought his army to the aid of Mantua in its current war. Honorio, the Duke's son and Fioretta's brother, favors Leonato; while he lies wounded, Flaviano schemes to persuade the Duke that Leonato is a wild young man who is morally unfit to be Fioretta's husband. Flaviano manipulates the situation so that Fioretta is moved to a convent, from where he spirits her secretly to his mother's country house. He also puts out word that Fioretta has decided to remain at the convent for a year, effectively postponing the marriage. Prince Leonato is outraged, and blames the Duke for bad faith; he demands a face-to- face meeting with Fioretta. The Duke feels that he cannot deny this demand -- but he and Flaviano plan to substitute another woman in the meeting. One of the novices at the content is Flaviano's former mistress Juliana; Flaviano prevails upon her to take Fioretta's part. He even wants Juliana to marry Leonato -- but the Duke will not go that far; Juliana is merely to insist upon the one-year delay. Prince Leonato arrives at the convent, and has his meeting with the false Fioretta. Juliana, superficially, plays her part as instructed; yet Leonato correctly interprets her replies to indicate that she would not object if he forced the issue. Taking the hint, Leonato leads a troop of his men to break into the convent and carry off \\"Fioretta.\\" He takes her home to Ferrara...where the true Fioretta has also arrived. Suspicious of Flaviano, Fioretta has escaped from his mother's country house and reached Ferrara in disguise, where she has taken an assumed name and is staying with Leonato's sister Donabella. Honorio has also come to Ferrara, to seek justice and vengeance for what he thinks is the rape of his sister. As he and Leonato are prepared to duel, Juliana and Donabella rush between them. Honorio confronts his pretended sister, but Juliana manages to persuade him to remain silent for the time being. The real Fioretta locates and welcomes her brother, while Juliana confronts Prince Leonato. She tells the prince that she is a noble virgin forced to impersonate Fioretta by the Duke of Mantua. Honorio breaks in with a captive Flaviano; Flaviano has followed Honorio to Ferrara to kill him, but has gotten caught instead. Honorio tries to explain Flaviano's villainous manipulations -- but Leonato refuses to listen; he believes Juliana, and has resolved both to marry her and to go to war with Mantua. For a moment, Flaviano's plotting appears to have worked; but he is betrayed by a co- conspirator named Claudio. Juliana's falsehood is exposed; she begs for mercy, but Leonato casts her aside. The Duke of Mantua himself arrives in Ferrara, and the Fioretta/Juliana tangle is exposed and unraveled. Leonato is matched with Fioretta, and Honorio with Donabella; Juliana is sent back to the convent, and Flaviano is exiled. The play's subplot involves the courting of the widow Florelia by the soldiers Hortensio and Volterino. Florelia says that she will marry the man who cures her son Bertoldi of his cowardice. The soldiers, with a share of soldierly drinking and brawling, try to make Bertoldi brave, and failing that, to make him appear brave; but that fails too. Eventually making the best of a bad job, Florelia marries Hortensio. NotesReferences * Forsythe, Robert Stanley. The Relations of Shirley's Plays to the Elizabethan Drama.

The film, which premiered at the 44th New York Film Festival, focuses on the life of this extraordinary player from his meteoric rise as a child prodigy to fame and fortune as a revolutionary strategic thinker, as well as the tumultuous global conflicts between his homeland and his adopted nation. The film also features a scene involving the Atomic bomb go game. The film also screened at the AFI's China Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland. Plot The Go Master shines a light on the life and times of Wu Qingyuan, pronounced Go Seigen in Japanese. Wu is considered the greatest Go player of the 20th century, his talents bringing him from his native China to a professional career in Japan when he was only a teenager. Based on Wu's autobiography, this elegantly shot and remarkably restrained biopic follows the life of a singular figure, fascinating not only for his genius and achievements in the game of Go, but also for his unique experiences as a Chinese man in Japan during an immensely turbulent period in history. Acclaimed Taiwanese actor Chang Chen (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) portrays the titular role in a subtle, poignant performance that is as penetrating as it is opaque, underlying the brooding lyricism of the film. The Go Master co- stars Sylvia Chang, Matsuzaka Keiko, Emoto Akira, and Ito Ayumi, and Wu Qingyuan himself appears briefly in the film's prologue. Also of note is the film's costume design, which is by renowned designer Wada Emi (Ran, Hero, House of Flying Daggers). With the breakout of the Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s, Wu Qingyuan (Chang Chen) and his family are thrown into an uncomfortable and dangerous position as Chinese nationals residing in Japan. While Wu's family returns to China, he chooses to stay behind in his adopted country to continue to pursue the game of Go. In the quiet recluse of his school, there are no politics, only the singular dedication to his art and the love for his wife Kazuko (Ayumi Ito). However, the chaos of the times eventually forces him out of his enclave, throwing his life and mind into conflict.Review courtesy of Asia Torrents Wu's career ends abruptly when he is struck by a motorcycle in a collision which does not appear to be an accident. This real-life incident may have been a conspiracy against him by opponents in the world of Go, where he remained an unshakable winner. He is later hospitalized and can no longer play Go, due to brain trauma. Despite this, the film ends nostalgically in the golden room of Go.

Costume design was by the acclaimed Emi Wada, famous for such films as Kurosawa's Ran, Dreams, as well as Zhang Yimou's Hero and House of Flying Daggers. Critical reception A.O. Scott of The New York Times called The Go Master \\"a stately and respectful biopic\\", as well as \\"deliberate and contemplative rather than dramatic or psychologically probing\\" and \\"gorgeously shot\\".

It gives a good example of the rule that a clause cannot be incorporated after a contract has been concluded, without reasonable notice before. Also, it was held that an automatic ticket machine was an offer, rather than an invitation to treat. Although the case is important for these two propositions, today any exclusion of negligence liability for personal injury by businesses is prohibited by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 s 2(1) and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 Sch 2, para(a). Facts Francis Thornton, \\"a free lance trumpeter of the highest quality\\", drove to the entrance of the multi-storey car park on Shoe Lane, before attending a performance at Farringdon Hall with the BBC. He took a ticket from the machine and parked his car. It said > \\"this ticket is issued subject to the conditions of issue as displayed on > the premises\\". And on the car park pillars near the paying office there was a list, one excluding liability for > \\"injury to the Customer‚Ä¶ howsoever that loss, misdelivery, damage or injury > shall be caused\\". Three hours later he had an accident before getting into his car. The car park argued that the judge should have held the matter regulated by this contract, not tort. Judgment Lord Denning MR held that the more onerous the clause, the better notice of it needed to be given. Moreover, the contract was already concluded when the ticket came out of the machine, and so any condition on it could not be incorporated in the contract. Megaw LJ and Sir Gordon Wilmer agreed with the onerous point, but reserved their opinions on where the contract was concluded. Furthermore, Sir Gordon Wilmer distinguished this from the other ticket cases based upon the fact that a human clerk proffered the ticket and the buyer had the opportunity to say I do not like those conditions.

Hoge was born in Pickrelltown, Ohio, and he received his early childhood education at the public schools in the nearby city of Bellefontaine. Afterwards, he received a classical education at Geneva College in Northwood and he graduated from Cincinnati Law School in 1859. Hoge was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced the practice of law in Bellefontaine. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Hoge enrolled in the Union Army as a First Lieutenant in the Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He was promoted to captain and became the commander of a Federal company of infantry. After the war, Hoge settled in Columbia, South Carolina, and despite possessing little legal experience was elected in 1868 as an associate justice to the South Carolina Supreme Court. While on the bench, Hoge never wrote a single opinion and \\"I concur\\" was the extent of his legal analysis. He was aware of his incapacity as a judge and he only served eighteen months on the bench before moving on to the House of Representatives. Hoge won a seat as a Republican to represent the 3rd congressional district after he successfully challenged the election of Democrat J.P. Reed to the Forty-first Congress. Since the Republicans controlled Congress, the two Democrats elected from South Carolina were unseated and Hoge filled the seat on April 8, 1869 and served the remainder of the term until March 3, 1871. Running on the Republican ticket with Franklin J. Moses, Jr. for governor in 1872, Hoge won the race for comptroller general against the Independent Republican candidate J. Scott Murray of Anderson. In 1874, Hoge waged another run for Congress to represent the 3rd district and he defeated Samuel McGowan, a Conservative Party candidate, to win the seat.

Laherr√®re and D. Sornette except in the cases of the two \\"Kings\\": China and India. Rank- size distribution is the distribution of size by rank, in decreasing order of size. For example, if a data set consists of items of sizes 5, 100, 5, and 8, the rank-size distribution is 100, 8, 5, 5 (ranks 1 through 4). This is also known as the rank-frequency distribution, when the source data are from a frequency distribution. These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scale, such as city size or word frequency. These distributions frequently follow a power law distribution, or less well-known ones such as a stretched exponential function or parabolic fractal distribution, at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks; see below. A rank-size distribution is not a probability distribution or cumulative distribution function. Rather, it is a discrete form of a quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution) in reverse order, giving the size of the element at a given rank. Simple rank-size distributions In the case of city populations, the resulting distribution in a country, a region, or the world will be characterized by its largest city, with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's largest city, a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the largest city, and so on.List of U.S. states' largest cities by populationList of United States cities by population When any log- linear factor is ranked, the ranks follow the Lucas numbers, which consist of the sequentially additive numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, etc. Like the more famous Fibonacci sequence, each number is approximately 1.618 (the Golden ratio) times the preceding number. For example, the third term in the sequence above, 4, is approximately 1.6183, or 4.236; the fourth term, 7, is approximately 1.6184, or 6.854; the eighth term, 47, is approximately 1.6188, or 46.979. With higher values, the figures converge. An equiangular spiral is sometimes used to visualize such sequences.  Segmentation  Wikipedia word frequency plot, showing three segments with distinct behavior. A rank-size (or rank-frequency) distribution is often segmented into ranges. This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors, particularly for market segmentation, but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies. Most simply and commonly, a distribution may be split in two pieces, termed the head and tail. If a distribution is broken into three pieces, the third (middle) piece has several terms, generically middle,Illustrating the Long Tail, Rand Fishkin, November 24th, 2009 also belly,Digg that Fat Belly!, Robert Young, Sep. 4, 2006 torso,The Long Tail Keyword Optimization Guide - How to Profit from Long Tail Keywords, August 3, 2009, Tom Demers and body.The Small Head, the Medium Body, and the Long Tail .. so, where's Microsoft? , 12 Mar 2005, Lawrence Liu's Report from the Inside These frequently have some adjectives added, most significantly long tail, also fat belly, chunky middle, etc. In more traditional terms, these may be called top-tier, mid-tier, and bottom-tier. The relative sizes and weights of these segments (how many ranks in each segment, and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment) qualitatively characterizes a distribution, analogously to the skewness or kurtosis of a probability distribution. Namely: is it dominated by a few top members (head-heavy, like profits in the recorded music industry), or is it dominated by many small members (tail-heavy, like internet search queries), or distributed in some other way? Practically, this determines strategy: where should attention be focused? These distinctions may be made for various reasons. For example, they may arise from differing properties of the population, as in the 90‚Äì9‚Äì1 principle, which posits that in an internet community, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. As another example, in marketing, one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention, such as personal phone calls; while the tail is everything else, which does not receive personalized attention, for example receiving form letters; and the line is simply set at a point that resources allow, or where it makes business sense to stop. Purely quantitatively, a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first p portion of ranks, which account for 1 - p of the overall population, as in the 80:20 Pareto principle, where the top 20% (head) comprises 80% of the overall population. The exact cutoff depends on the distribution ‚Äì each distribution has a single such cutoff point‚Äîand for power laws can be computed from the Pareto index. Segments may arise naturally due to actual changes in behavior of the distribution as rank varies. Most common is the king effect, where behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest, as illustrated at top for country populations, and above for most common words in English Wikipedia. For higher ranks, behavior may change at some point, and be well-modeled by different relations in different regions; on the whole by a piecewise function. For example, if two different power laws fit better in different regions, one can use a broken power law for the overall relation; the word frequency in English Wikipedia (above) also demonstrates this. The Yule‚ÄìSimon distribution that results from preferential attachment (intuitively, \\"the rich get richer\\" and \\"success breeds success\\") simulates a broken power law and has been shown to \\"very well capture\\" word frequency versus rank distributions. It originated from trying to explain the population versus rank in different species. It has also been shown to fit city population versus rank better.  Rank-size rule  The rank-size rule (or law) describes the remarkable regularity in many phenomena, including the distribution of city sizes, the sizes of businesses, the sizes of particles (such as sand), the lengths of rivers, the frequencies of word usage, and wealth among individuals. All are real-world observations that follow power laws, such as Zipf's law, the Yule distribution, or the Pareto distribution. If one ranks the population size of cities in a given country or in the entire world and calculates the natural logarithm of the rank and of the city population, the resulting graph will show a log-linear pattern. This is the rank-size distribution.Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution Steven Brakman, Harry Garretsen, and Charles van Marrewijk Theoretical rationale One study claims that the rank-size rule \\"works\\" because it is a \\"shadow\\" or coincidental measure of the true phenomenon.The Urban Rank-Size Hierarchy James W. Fonseca The true value of rank-size is thus not as an accurate mathematical measure (since other power-law formulas are more accurate, especially at ranks lower than 10) but rather as a handy measure or \\"rule of thumb\\" to spot power laws. When presented with a ranking of data, is the third-ranked variable approximately one-third the value of the highest- ranked one? Or, conversely, is the highest-ranked variable approximately ten times the value of the tenth-ranked one? If so, the rank-size rule has possibly helped spot another power law relationship. Known exceptions to simple rank-size distributions While Zipf's law works well in many cases, it tends to not fit the largest cities in many countries; one type of deviation is known as the King effect. A 2002 study found that Zipf's law was rejected for 53 of 73 countries, far more than would be expected based on random chance. The study also found that variations of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political variables than by economic geography variables like proxies for economies of scale or transportation costs.Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution A 2004 study showed that Zipf's law did not work well for the five largest cities in six countries.Cuberes, David, The Rise and Decline of Cities, University of Chicago, September 29, 2004 In the richer countries, the distribution was flatter than predicted. For instance, in the United States, although its largest city, New York City, has more than twice the population of second-place Los Angeles, the two cities' metropolitan areas (also the two largest in the country) are much closer in population. In metropolitan-area population, New York City is only 1.3 times larger than Los Angeles. In other countries, the largest city would dominate much more than expected. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the capital, Kinshasa, is more than eight times larger than the second-largest city, Lubumbashi. When considering the entire distribution of cities, including the smallest ones, the rank-size rule does not hold. Instead, the distribution is log-normal. This follows from Gibrat's law of proportionate growth. Because exceptions are so easy to find, the function of the rule for analyzing cities today is to compare the city-systems in different countries. The rank-size rule is a common standard by which urban primacy is established. A distribution such as that in the United States or China does not exhibit a pattern of primacy, but countries with a dominant \\"primate city\\" clearly vary from the rank-size rule in the opposite manner. Therefore, the rule helps to classify national (or regional) city-systems according to the degree of dominance exhibited by the largest city. Countries with a primate city, for example, have typically had a colonial history that accounts for that city pattern. If a normal city distribution pattern is expected to follow the rank- size rule (i.e. if the rank-size principle correlates with central place theory), then it suggests that those countries or regions with distributions that do not follow the rule have experienced some conditions that have altered the normal distribution pattern. For example, the presence of multiple regions within large nations such as China and the United States tends to favor a pattern in which more large cities appear than would be predicted by the rule. By contrast, small countries that had been connected (e.g. colonially/economically) to much larger areas will exhibit a distribution in which the largest city is much larger than would fit the rule, compared with the other cities‚Äîthe excessive size of the city theoretically stems from its connection with a larger system rather than the natural hierarchy that central place theory would predict within that one country or region alone.

It was directed by Vincente Minnelli, and based on a novel by William Gibson. The film stars Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, and Gloria Grahame Plot The opening credits are followed by the following onscreen words: > \\"The trouble began.\\" Dr. Stewart McIver (Richard Widmark) is now in charge of a psychiatric institution, one run for many years by medical director Dr. Douglas Devanal (Charles Boyer). McIver must address the needs of a number of disturbed patients, among them Steven Holte (John Kerr), a possibly suicidal artist, and the self-loathing Mr. Capp (Oscar Levant). All of his responsibilities keep McIver so busy that his wife, Karen (Gloria Grahame), feels increasingly frustrated and ignored. When new drapes are needed for the clinic's library, the dour and penny-pinching Victoria Inch (Lillian Gish) orders unattractive ones. Karen McIver takes it upon herself to buy a more expensive and colorful set instead, gaining the approval of the chairman of the board Regina Mitchell-Smythe (Mabel Albertson), but without the knowledge of her husband. What should be an insignificant matter is complicated further by Dr. McIver giving the patients, principally Stevie, permission to design and create the new drapes themselves. Personalities clash. Dr. Devanal, who has a drinking problem, has been having an affair with his secretary Miss Cobb (Adele Jergens), and makes a clumsy pass at McIver's wife as well. McIver begins to fall in love with Meg Rinehart (Lauren Bacall), a member of his staff. Miss Inch privately schemes to expose the unseemly behavior of Devanal at the next meeting of the board and issues a veiled threat to do so to McIver as well, while Devanal's wife, Edna (Fay Wray), mistakenly believes McIver to be behind the plot to discredit her husband. Having felt stable enough to go on a date with Sue Brett (Susan Strasberg), another patient, Stevie Holte is very upset to discover that new drapes have been installed, not the ones his artwork was meant to inspire. He disappears, causing a search party to look for him and McIver to fear a suicide. At the next board meeting, Dr. Devanal submits his resignation to the board. After the meeting, the McIvers agree to work on their marriage and head home where they find Stevie having survived his attempt at suicide. At the end of the film, the words appear onscreen. > \\"The trouble was over.\\" Cast * Richard Widmark as Dr. Stewart McIver * Lauren Bacall as Meg Rinehart * Charles Boyer as Dr. Devanal * Gloria Grahame as Karen McIver * Lillian Gish as Victoria Inch * John Kerr as Steven W.

It is related to the Fourier transformJudith C. Brown, Calculation of a constant Q spectral transform, J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 89(1):425‚Äì434, 1991. and very closely related to the complex Morlet wavelet transform.Continuous Wavelet Transform \\"When the mother wavelet can be interpreted as a windowed sinusoid (such as the Morlet wavelet), the wavelet transform can be interpreted as a constant-Q Fourier transform. Before the theory of wavelets, constant-Q Fourier transforms (such as obtained from a classic third-octave filter bank) were not easy to invert, because the basis signals were not orthogonal.\\" The transform can be thought of as a series of filters fk, logarithmically spaced in frequency, with the k-th filter having a spectral width Œ¥fk equal to a multiple of the previous filter's width: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta f_k &= 2^{1/n} \\\\cdot \\\\delta f_{k-1} \\\\ &= \\\\left( 2^{1/n} \\\\right)^k \\\\cdot \\\\delta f_\\\\text{min}, \\\\end{align} where Œ¥fk is the bandwidth of the k-th filter, fmin is the central frequency of the lowest filter, and n is the number of filters per octave.  Calculation  The short-time Fourier transform of x[n] for a frame shifted to sample m is calculated as follows: :X[k,m] = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} W[n-m] x[n] e^{-j 2 \\\\pi k n/N}. Given a data series sampled at fs = 1/T, T being the sampling period of our data, for each frequency bin we can define the following: * Filter width, Œ¥fk. * Q, the \\"quality factor\\": :: Q = \\\\frac{f_k}{\\\\delta f_k}. : This is shown below to be the integer number of cycles processed at a center frequency fk. As such, this somewhat defines the time complexity of the transform. * Window length for the k-th bin: :: N[k] = \\\\frac{f_\\\\text{s}}{\\\\delta f_k} = \\\\frac{f_\\\\text{s}}{f_k} Q. :Since fs/fk is the number of samples processed per cycle at frequency fk, Q is the number of integer cycles processed at this central frequency. The equivalent transform kernel can be found by using the following substitutions: * The window length of each bin is now a function of the bin number: ::N = N[k] = Q \\\\frac{f_\\\\text{s}}{f_k}. * The relative power of each bin will decrease at higher frequencies, as these sum over fewer terms. To compensate for this, we normalize by N[k]. * Any windowing function will be a function of window length, and likewise a function of window number. For example, the equivalent Hamming window would be :: W[k,n] = \\\\alpha - (1 - \\\\alpha) \\\\cos \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N[k] - 1}, \\\\quad \\\\alpha = 25/46, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leqslant n \\\\leqslant N[k] - 1. * Our digital frequency, \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi k}{N} , becomes \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi Q}{N[k]} . After these modifications, we are left with :X[k] = \\\\frac{1}{N[k]} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N[k]-1} W[k,n] x[n] e^{\\\\frac{-j2 \\\\pi Qn}{N[k]}}. Fast calculation The direct calculation of the constant-Q transform is slow when compared against the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, the FFT can itself be employed, in conjunction with the use of a kernel, to perform the equivalent calculation but much faster.Judith C. Brown and Miller S. Puckette, An efficient algorithm for the calculation of a constant Q transform, J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 92(5):2698‚Äì2701, 1992. An approximate inverse to such an implementation was proposed in 2006; it works by going back to the DFT, and is only suitable for pitch instruments. A development on this method with improved invertibility involves performing CQT (via FFT) octave-by- octave, using lowpass filtered and downsampled results for consecutively lower pitches. paper Implementations of this method include the MATLAB implementation and LibROSA's Python implementation. LibROSA combines the subsampled method with the direct FFT method (which it dubs \\"pseudo-CQT\\") by having the latter process higher frequencies as a whole.  Comparison with the Fourier transform  In general, the transform is well suited to musical data, and this can be seen in some of its advantages compared to the fast Fourier transform. As the output of the transform is effectively amplitude/phase against log frequency, fewer frequency bins are required to cover a given range effectively, and this proves useful where frequencies span several octaves. As the range of human hearing covers approximately ten octaves from 20 Hz to around 20 kHz, this reduction in output data is significant. The transform exhibits a reduction in frequency resolution with higher frequency bins, which is desirable for auditory applications. The transform mirrors the human auditory system, whereby at lower-frequencies spectral resolution is better, whereas temporal resolution improves at higher frequencies. At the bottom of the piano scale (about 30 Hz), a difference of 1 semitone is a difference of approximately 1.5 Hz, whereas at the top of the musical scale (about 5 kHz), a difference of 1 semitone is a difference of approximately 200 Hz.http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/graphics/notes.GIF So for musical data the exponential frequency resolution of constant-Q transform is ideal. In addition, the harmonics of musical notes form a pattern characteristic of the timbre of the instrument in this transform. Assuming the same relative strengths of each harmonic, as the fundamental frequency changes, the relative position of these harmonics remains constant. This can make identification of instruments much easier. The constant Q transform can also be used for automatic recognition of musical keys based on accumulated chroma content. Hendrik Purwins, Benjamin Blankertz and Klaus Obermayer, A New Method for Tracking Modulations in Tonal Music in Audio Data Format, International Joint Conference on Neural Network (IJCNN‚Äô00)., 6:270-275, 2000. Relative to the Fourier transform, implementation of this transform is more tricky. This is due to the varying number of samples used in the calculation of each frequency bin, which also affects the length of any windowing function implemented.Benjamin Blankertz, The Constant Q Transform, 1999. Also note that because the frequency scale is logarithmic, there is no true zero-frequency / DC term present, which may in some cases be a drawback.

Celebration of the New Baptist Covenant The effort began with a \\"Celebration of the New Baptist Covenant,\\" a major conference of diverse Baptist organizations held in Atlanta, Georgia, January 30 through February 1, 2008. Carter said the meeting would be \\"one of the most historic events at least in the history of Baptists in this country, maybe Christianity.\\" Clinton told reporters that those who \\"did not have both the privilege and the burden to be raised in the Baptist church cannot possibly appreciate\\" how unique such cooperation is. \\"This is an attempt to bring people together and say, 'What would our Christian witness require of us in the 21st century?'\\" Clinton said.'Baptist Covenant' offers chance to heal racial wounds, leaders say. http://www.churchexecutive.com/Page.cfm/PageID/8257 \\"Our goal is to have a major demonstration of harmony and a common commitment to personify and to accomplish the goals that Jesus Christ expressed in his sermon to his own hometown of Nazareth,\\" said Carter.http://www.newbaptistcovenant.org/about.icm/ New Baptist Covenant Website Planners announced the theme of the gathering would be Unity in Christ. The Biblical basis for the meeting is cited as Jesus‚Äô reading of scripture in the Synagogue as recorded in . In these verses, Jesus reads from Isaiah: > The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good > news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim the release of the captives, > and the recovering of sight of the blind, to set at liberty those who are > oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. This call by Jesus to pursue both evangelism and ministry to \\"the least of these\\" is said to be the Biblical foundation for the New Baptist Covenant. History=Inaugural meeting‚ÄîApril 2006 The New Baptist Covenant traces its roots to April 10, 2006, when former U.S. President and prominent Baptist layman Jimmy Carter and Mercer University President Bill Underwood convened at The Carter Center in Atlanta a group of 18 Baptist leaders representing more than 20 million Baptists across North America. The leaders were said to be unanimous in their desire to transcend their differences‚Äìincluding such factors as race, culture, geography and convention affiliation‚Äìand seek common purpose. The outcome of the meeting was a document called A North American Baptist Covenant and preliminary plans to hold a major gathering of Baptists from throughout North America in 2008. The initiative stems from the adoption of the \\"North American Baptist Covenant\\" in which leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Baptist values including evangelism, helping the needy and promoting religious liberty. It will be the first time since 1845 that there has been a major effort to bring together Baptists from diverse racial, theological and regional backgrounds. Most US Baptists met in 1814 to form a missionary society known as the Triennial Convention. Southern Baptists broke away over the slavery issue in 1845. Since then, Baptists have splintered even further, most recently due to the Conservative Resurgence/Fundamentalist Takeover of the Southern Baptist Convention in the last two decades of the twentieth century. Many object to the use of the word \\"takeover\\", since the Southern Baptist Convention is historically a conservative denomination as found in 'The Baptist Faith and Message', among other sources and reasons. Follow-up meeting‚ÄîJanuary 2007 A follow-up meeting attended by 80 representatives of more than 30 Baptist organizations was held on January 9, 2007, at The Carter Center. The core group of those who gathered were representatives of organizations that are members of the North American Baptist Fellowship (NABF), a regional affiliate of the Baptist World Alliance. At the conclusion of the meeting, the representatives announced plans to hold a \\"Celebration of a New Baptist Covenant\\" in Atlanta on January 30-February 1, 2008. The 80 representatives at this meeting are leaders of 30 Baptist organizations in the United States, Canada and Mexico. This meeting was termed by one of the organizers \\"a historic demonstration of Baptist unity\\"Moderate Baptists to meet in Atlanta on 21st century issues. http://www.macon.com/mld/macon/16420487.htm by deciding to focus on concerns shared by attendees as followers of Christ rather than dwell on obvious differences. Most participants at the Atlanta meeting are members of the 20-million-member North American Baptist Fellowship, part of the 102-year-old Baptist World Alliance. The Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention decided in 2004 to pull out of the Baptist World Alliance. While individual Southern Baptists were involved in the announcement, no current leaders of the 16 million-member denomination attended the meeting. Assessments The four largest of the predominantly African-American Baptist conventions began meeting jointly in recent years. They planned to do so again in early 2008 and then join with other Baptists a few days later for the \\"Celebration of a New Baptist Covenant.\\" The general secretary of the American Baptist Churches USA said this vision of Baptists coming together could encourage American Baptists soured by their denomination's fragmentation over homosexuality. The national coordinator of the Atlanta-based Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF), a quasi-denomination that emerged from the recent moderate/fundamentalist controversy, said the Carter initiative fills a need for \\"a broader Baptist witness that is committed to social justice as well as evangelism.\\" The New Baptist Covenant will be a \\"re-claiming of Baptist heritage,\\" according to a statement from the Baptist Joint Committee. Further, it will be \\"a commitment to working cooperatively, being agreeable in our disagreements, and honoring historic Baptist tenets of soul freedom and religious liberty.\\". The 2008 \\"Celebration of a New Baptist Covenant\\" is not expected to create a new denomination or political coalition. However, planners hope it will inspire collaboration around evangelism and social causes, drawing together an even larger coalition of Baptists from the North and South, the U.S. and Canada, and predominantly black and predominantly white conventions and fellowships. Advocates of the New Baptist Covenant predicted it will help heal the racial divide that has separated Baptists in America since before the American Civil War. Carter and Clinton‚Äîboth raised Southern Baptist‚Äîannounced the groups had committed to put aside more than a century and a half of social and theological differences to unite behind an agenda of compassionate ministry. Though the former presidents are both Democrats, Republicans were invited to attend the initial 2007 nonpartisan gathering as well. The program chairman said there would definitely be Republican speakers in the plenary session.\\" Covenant most important Baptist event since Civil War, Allen says,\\" The Baptist Standard, March 22, 2007. Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, which is not involved in the New Baptist Covenant, dismissed the event as merely another chance for disgruntled moderate and liberal Baptists to express their disapproval and contempt for the more conservative SBC. Some also have pointed to the event's election-year timing and Clinton and Carter's involvement as evidence it is designed to stir up Baptist support for Democrats‚Äîand especially the presidential bid of Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton.

Although the road is now split in two, having had its western and eastern sections disconnected due to the extension of Roe Highway, it remains Welshpool's second most important road (after Orrong Road), and the highest quality access road for the Darling Scarp. Welshpool Road East is part of State Route 8, while the entire road was previously allocated State Route 35. Route description=Welshpool Road Welshpool Road west of Roe Highway is long, and unlike Welshpool Road East, did not have a West suffix added after the road's disconnection. The road is typical of those major in the Welshpool Area; although of a reasonable quality, being a 4-lane single or dual carriageway it contains only a handful of traffic lights, is choked by traffic in peak hour, has industrial business dotting the road, and has many minor roads which have no form of control, give way and stop signs excepted. Welshpool Road begins as an extension of a west-east section of Albany Highway (Albany Highway continues to the south of the intersection). Continuing through Welshpool, it meets Leach Highway soon after. Leach Highway marks the most dangerous intersection for both Welshpool Road and Leach Highway; the intersection is also one of Perth's busiest. It then meets Kewdale Road, passing through outer Welshpool after this point. The final controlled intersection for the road is McDowell Street. McDowell Street extends north, meets Orrong Road, and then continues into neighbouring Kewdale. Although of importance for barely , McDowell Street distributes traffic onto Orrong Road, allowing motorists to continue their journey along Welshpool Road East. For those who continue along Welshpool Road, the road sharply turns south after , and continues as William Street. =JunctionsWelshpool Road East Welshpool Road East (9.5 km long) had an East suffix added after the road's disconnection. At a similar quality to Welshpool Road, its 4-lane section is an entire dual carriageway; it changes to a 2 to 3 lane single carriageway after climbing most of the Darling Scarp, however. With only 4 traffic lights in total (two of those at Roe Highway's diamond interchange), traffic problems are relatively minor, the only congestion being towards Roe Highway westbound. Allocated State Route 8, Welshpool Road East starts as an extension of Orrong Road. Soon after meeting Roe Highway, it meets Hale Road. Hale Road serves as the main road for Forrestfield, eventually passing through a rural Maida Vale and climbing the Darling Scarp. Welshpool Road then passes through Wattle Grove, a mostly rural foothill suburb; however, this section is suburban. It then meets Tonkin Highway; this marks both State Route 8 and Welshpool Road's final traffic light and departure from the Swan Coastal Plain. After this point, the scenery transitions to semi-rural; however, the quality of the road remains high. After about , the road starts to climb the Darling Scarp, varying from 6 to 10 degree angle of slope. A short time after this, the median which was previously as wide as 4 lanes thins out dramatically, and becomes negligible. The road continues to climb quite steeply; similar to Great Eastern Highway the climb is constant; Kalamunda Road's climb of the escarpment is undulating. Welshpool Road East then meets Lesmurdie Road, and finally changes to a 2-lane single carriageway. After this point, westbound traffic is given two overtaking lanes that last for about each. Finishing its climb in Carmel, Welshpool Road terminates into Canning Road. =JunctionsHistory Roe Highway's extension beyond Welshpool Road in 2002 represented the biggest change to Perth's transport infrastructure since the Graham Farmer Freeway was opened in 2000. Welshpool Road, Orrong Road and William Street were the 3 major roads affected due to the extension. Before Roe Highway's extension in 2002, the highway's north and southbound lanes separated, leaving a gap between them once they met Welshpool Road. After this, they both formed one lane and came back together, continuing as William Street. Orrong Road would terminate into Welshpool Road in the form of a T-junction. Due to the extension of Roe Highway, major changes were made. Firstly, Welshpool Road was disconnected; William Street was disconnected from Roe Highway, and Orrong Road was extended to meet Roe Highway in the form of a diamond interchange. Orrong Road now continues as Welshpool Road East. Welshpool Road West now continues as William Street.

It is one of the oldest shopping malls in the Chicago area.Harlem Irving Plaza : Get HIP! History Built on the site of a former livestock farm, Harlem Irving Plaza opened in 1956 as a strip mall featuring approximately 45 tenants. Original anchor stores included Kroger, Walgreens, Wieboldt's, W.T. Grant, and Woolworth. The plaza became a member of the International Council of Shopping Centers a year after opening. Between 1975 and 1979, the former strip mall was enclosed, and a parking garage was added. Also in 1979, Madigan's was added to the roster of department stores. MainStreet, a short- lived subsidiary of Federated Department Stores opened at the mall in 1987, just as Wieboldt's closed. In 1988, Kohl's acquired and converted all of the stores in the MainStreet chain; Carson Pirie Scott opened in the former Wieboldt's the same year. A food court was added in 1996, and Best Buy opened in the former Madigan's. Best Buy re-located to the mall's parking lot in 2001; its original location was replaced with a second parking garage. The mall underwent a thorough renovation in 2004, gaining a Target in August of that year. In honor of the mall's 50th anniversary in 2006, Harlem Irving Plaza hosted a meet and greet with the original Mouseketeers (Mickey Mouse Club). In honor of the mall's 60th anniversary in 2016, Harlem Irving Plaza hosted a meet and greet with Bobby Hull, Mike Ditka and Dick Butkus. Sports Authority, Panera Bread, Chipotle, and a fitness center were to be added in a 2013 expansion. Sports Authority has since closed. It was announced that in the fall of 2017 Nordstrom Rack would take the place of the vacated Sports Authority location. Carson's has since gone out of business.

Early life Manning was born in Alphington, near Exeter, Devon, the second son of John Edye Manning, and his wife Matilda Jorden, n√©e Cooke. William Manning was educated in Tavistock, Southampton and University College, London. Manning then worked for an uncle, Serjeant Manning and was entered at Lincoln's Inn in November 1827. He was called to the bar in November 1832 and practised as a barrister on the Western Circuit. In collaboration with S. Neville, Manning prepared and published Reports of Cases Relating to the Duty and Offices of Magistrates (3 volumes, 1834-8), and was the author of Proceedings in Courts of Revision in the Isle of Wight (1836). On 16 August 1836 he married Emily Anne, n√©e Wise (sister of Edward Wise), in Paris. Career in Australia Photograph of Sir William Montagu Manning In 1837 William and Emily Manning went to Australia on the City of Edinburgh, joining William's father who was registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Soon after his arrival in Sydney on 31 August 1837 was made a chairman of Quarter Sessions with a salary of ¬£800. He took up his duties at Bathurst, New South Wales in October. In 1842 he was offered the position of resident judge at Port Phillip District, and in September 1844 became Solicitor General for New South Wales. In January 1848 he was appointed acting-judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales during the absence of Mr Justice Therry. He resumed the position of Solicitor General at the end of 1849, and held this position until responsible government was established in 1856, when he retired with a pension of ¬£800 a year. Manning was nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council by Governor Fitzroy in October 1851, and assisted in the preparation of William Wentworth's constitution bill. Manning was elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in the first parliament, topping the poll for the South Riding of Cumberland. Manning was Attorney-General of New South Wales in the Stuart Donaldson ministry from 6 June to 25 August 1856. He was given the same position in the Henry Parker ministry in October 1856, but resigned on 25 May 1857 on account of ill-health. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel on 23 May 1857, the second NSW Barrister to be so appointed, and went to England. On 23 February 1858 Manning was knighted by the Queen Victoria. On his return Manning was offered a temporary seat on the Supreme Court of New South Wales but declined it. On 21 February 1860 joined the William Forster ministry as attorney-general, but the ministry resigned about a fortnight later. In September 1861 he was appointed to the Legislative Council. He was again attorney-general in the John Robertson and Charles Cowper ministries from October 1868 to December 1870. In February 1875, though he was then a member of the upper house he was asked to form a ministry, but was unable to obtain sufficient support. Manning was appointed a Supreme court judge in 1876, requiring his resignation from the Legislative Council. He was primary judge in equity until his resignation in 1887. He voluntarily gave up his pension when he became a judge. On 8 February 1888 Manning was again nominated to the Legislative Council, and gave useful service there until near the end of his life. University of Sydney Manning's grave at St Jude's Church cemetery, Randwick Manning had been elected a fellow of the senate of the University of Sydney in 1861, became chancellor in 1878 and held this position until his death on 27 February 1895 in Sydney. Before Manning came into office the University had fewer than a hundred students in 1877, but during his chancellorship there was much expansion in the scope of the university and several new chairs were founded. He fought for and succeeded in getting increased grants from the government, stressed the need for more grammar schools to be created, and for the provision of university scholarships. He pleaded that women should have the same opportunities as men at the university and this was granted in 1881. Manning saved the university ¬£15,000 by his discovery that the British taxation commissioners were charging succession duty on the John Henry Challis estate on too high a scale. Manning's portrait by Sir John Watson Gordon, paid for by public subscription is in the MacLaurin Hall at Sydney University. He was knighted in 1858 and created K.C.M.G. in 1892. Manning married a second time to Eliza Anne, daughter of the Very Rev. William Sowerby on 7 June 1849. He was survived by a son and daughter from his first marriage; and his second wife and their son and three daughters. A daughter, Emily Matilda Manning (1845‚Äì1890), was a noted writer. Manning was buried in the cemetery of St Jude's Church, Randwick.

It serves approximately 700 students; a typical graduating class has 160 to 200 members. It has existed for over 100 years. The current building was built in 1969, with the old building then being turned into a middle school. That building was built in 1921 replacing an earlier school destroyed, along with much of the town, in the 1918 Cloquet fire.2017 article on occasion of closing of the Middle School building Academics Curriculum requirements for the four core areas are as follows: three-and-a-half years of mathematics, four years of English, four years of social studies (including geography, world events, economics, US government, world and US history courses), and three years of science. Students are required to take a year of physical education and a year of art (performance or visual). CHS offers courses in Spanish, German, and Anishinaabe. The College In The Schools (CITS) program allows students to take classes in high school, with teachers in the building, for credit through local colleges, notably Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College and the University of Minnesota Duluth. The colleges certify high school teachers and approve course curriculums, and students who take those courses receive a separate transcript from the college in addition to the normal high school transcript. Students also have the option of post secondary enrollment; for either senior or junior year (or both) they may enroll directly in a local college. They still graduate from CHS and can join sports and other extracurriculars at the high school, but attend all or part of their classes at the college. Athletics The school contends at state level in American football, basketball, hockey, and soccer. In order to participate in athletics they need to maintain a minimum GPA and behavior code, as established by the Minnesota State High School League and CHS.

His most notable works of the 1930s were comparable to the advanced modern abstract style of his older brother, the artist Ben Nicholson.  Early life and education  Kit Nicholson was born on 16 December 1904 at Pilgrim's Lane, Hampstead, the fourth child of the artists William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde. His siblings were the celebrated painter Ben (1894‚Äì1982); Anthony (1897‚Äì1918), who died of wounds in France during the First World War; and Annie Mary \\"Nancy\\" (1899‚Äì1978), artist and wife of the poet Robert Graves. Kit Nicholson was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, from 1917 to 1922, and then read architecture at St. John's College, Cambridge. In 1926 he won a one-year Davison Scholarship to study architecture at Princeton University.  Career  After his return to Britain in 1927 he undertook several small architectural commissions. From 1929 to 1930 he taught at the School of Architecture, University of Cambridge; one of his pupils was Hugh Casson. Nicholson moved to London in 1931, and worked for Watson Hart and Val Myer. In December 1931 Nicholson married Elsie Queen Myers, usually known as EQ Nicholson, whom he had met in about 1930. In 1933 Nicholson started his own architectural practice, in premises over a chemist's in the Fulham Road. Casson joined the practice in 1934, and EQ also worked there. Between 1933 and 1934 Nicholson worked on the design and construction of a new studio for Augustus John at Fordingbridge in Hampshire. In 1935 and 1936 he designed and built the premises of the London Gliding Club at Dunstable in Bedfordshire. In the same period he made alterations to Monkton House for Edward James, and designed and constructed a private house, Kit's Close, at Henley. In 1938 James asked him to design a new building for his estate at West Dean, which was to incorporate the fa√ßade of James Wyatt's Pantheon in Oxford Street, London, which was being demolished. Nicholson was elected to the Modern Architecture Research Group in 1937, and was on the committee which organised the New Architecture Exhibition held by the group at the New Burlington Galleries in London from 11 to 29 January 1938. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Nicholson signed up as a Meteorological Officer in the Fleet Air Arm. Between 1943 and 1945 he was the commander in charge of flying at the Inskip airfield in Lancashire. In 1945 he flew a Hellcat to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to take up a position as commander of the Katukurunda base of the Fleet Air Arm. He flew solo, and the journey took him a month. After he returned to Britain in 1946, Nicholson resumed practice as an architect. He undertook small commissions, including some design work for exhibition stands, and the design of radio and television sets for Ferranti. A gliding enthusiast, Nicholson died at age 44 on 28 July 1948 in a gliding accident during the World Gliding Championships at Samedan in the Graub√ºnden, in Switzerland.  Legacy and honours  In 1988 an exhibition in York showed Nicholson's work beside that of his brother, his sister and his wife. In 1994, the Royal Institute of British Architects acquired his complete collection of drawings, records and photographs for the Drawings Collection of the British Architectural Library. A selection was reproduced by Neil Bingham in Christopher Nicholson (1996), from the early projects through to his major buildings such as Augustus John's studio and the London Gliding Club.

A set C and its polar cone Co. The dual cone and the polar cone are symmetric to each other with respect to the origin. Dual cone and polar cone are closely related concepts in convex analysis, a branch of mathematics.  Dual cone = In a vector space  The dual cone C of a subset C in a linear space X over the reals, e.g. Euclidean space Rn, with dual space X is the set :C^* = \\\\left {y\\\\in X^*: \\\\langle y , x \\\\rangle \\\\geq 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall x\\\\in C \\\\right }, where \\\\langle y, x \\\\rangle is the duality pairing between X and X, i.e. \\\\langle y, x\\\\rangle = y(x). C is always a convex cone, even if C is neither convex nor a cone.  In a topological vector space  If X is a topological vector space over the real or complex numbers, then the dual cone of a subset C ‚äÜ X is the following set of continuous linear functionals on X: :C^{\\\\prime} := \\\\left{ f \\\\in X^{\\\\prime} : \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\left( f (x) \\\\right) \\\\geq 0 \\\\text{ for all } x \\\\in C \\\\right}, which is the polar of the set -C. No matter what C is, C^{\\\\prime} will be a convex cone. If C ‚äÜ {0} then C^{\\\\prime} = X^{\\\\prime}.  In a Hilbert space (internal dual cone)  Alternatively, many authors define the dual cone in the context of a real Hilbert space (such as Rn equipped with the Euclidean inner product) to be what is sometimes called the internal dual cone. :C^*_\\\\text{internal} := \\\\left {y\\\\in X: \\\\langle y , x \\\\rangle \\\\geq 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall x\\\\in C \\\\right }. Using this latter definition for C, we have that when C is a cone, the following properties hold: * A non-zero vector y is in C if and only if both of the following conditions hold: #y is a normal at the origin of a hyperplane that supports C. #y and C lie on the same side of that supporting hyperplane. *C is closed and convex. *C_1 \\\\subseteq C_2 implies C_2^* \\\\subseteq C_1^*. *If C has nonempty interior, then C is pointed, i.e. C* contains no line in its entirety. *If C is a cone and the closure of C is pointed, then C has nonempty interior. *C is the closure of the smallest convex cone containing C (a consequence of the hyperplane separation theorem)  Self-dual cones  A cone C in a vector space X is said to be self-dual if X can be equipped with an inner product ‚ü®‚ãÖ,‚ãÖ‚ü© such that the internal dual cone relative to this inner product is equal to C.Iochum, Bruno, \\"C√¥nes autopolaires et alg√®bres de Jordan\\", Springer, 1984. Those authors who define the dual cone as the internal dual cone in a real Hilbert space usually say that a cone is self- dual if it is equal to its internal dual. This is slightly different than the above definition, which permits a change of inner product. For instance, the above definition makes a cone in Rn with ellipsoidal base self-dual, because the inner product can be changed to make the base spherical, and a cone with spherical base in Rn is equal to its internal dual. The nonnegative orthant of Rn and the space of all positive semidefinite matrices are self-dual, as are the cones with ellipsoidal base (often called \\"spherical cones\\", \\"Lorentz cones\\", or sometimes \\"ice-cream cones\\"). So are all cones in R3 whose base is the convex hull of a regular polygon with an odd number of vertices. A less regular example is the cone in R3 whose base is the \\"house\\": the convex hull of a square and a point outside the square forming an equilateral triangle (of the appropriate height) with one of the sides of the square.  Polar cone  The polar of the closed convex cone C is the closed convex cone Co, and vice versa. For a set C in X, the polar cone of C is the set :C^o = \\\\left {y\\\\in X^*: \\\\langle y , x \\\\rangle \\\\leq 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall x\\\\in C \\\\right }. It can be seen that the polar cone is equal to the negative of the dual cone, i.e. Co = ‚àíC. For a closed convex cone C in X, the polar cone is equivalent to the polar set for C.

The objective of the sanctuary is to enhance the habitat of the sanctuary for the benefit of the fish and wildlife which live within or migrate through the sanctuary.  The land The terrain at Enzo Creek is incredibly diverse. From non-tidal marsh to mature northern hardwoods, the land is fertile and nurtures a healthy vibrant ecosystem. The landscape is rolling in elevation, and no less than 13 soil types are found throughout. Rocky deposits are found throughout Enzo Creek, a result of Michigan's last glacial retreat about 14,000 years ago. It is the sanctuary‚Äôs diversity of habitat that is the foundation upon which Enzo Creek's wildlife management plan has found success. The mineral and oil composition of Enzo Creek is largely unknown, although areas of Mecosta County are known to have abundant reserves of crude oil. Michigan Department of Environmental Quality  The water  Enzo Creek's water resources are a key ingredient to its unique ecosystem. Four highly eutrophic ponds are located on the property. Most are no more than three feet deep, and were formed as a result of beavers damming flowing water.Hunt Lake The largest body of water is Townline Lake, which is in size. The sanctuary has nearly 1/4 mile frontage on the Southwest shore of the lake. Hunt Lake is in size and has an area of flooded timber at the north end of the lake which is known as Hunt Marsh. Hunt Marsh is a result of this same beaver activity creating the impoundment blocking Enzo Creek, the only outlet to Hunt Lake. Hunt Lake has a maximum depth of , and visibility generally exceeds , despite a marl substrate. Enzo Creek, the creek for which the sanctuary owes its name, flows South and Easterly and joins the outlet to Townline Lake. Enzo Creek flows approximately 1.3 miles from its beginning at Hunt Lake before it joins Ryan Creek, which then flows into the Muskegon River watershed. Beaver Pipes were installed in 2009 by Enzo Creek's management to help control the water level in Hunt Marsh, which had been steadily growing since 2005. This method of water control proved to be ineffective as beavers were able to block water passage through the pipes. The beaver pipes were ultimately removed completely, and a much larger 20\\" culvert pipe was installed through the dam and encased with hog wire fencing to prevent beavers from stuffing the pipe full of timber to block water passage. Over the course of a single year, beavers were able to dam the area around the hog wire fencing and again gain control of the water level. Work is ongoing to try and reach a permanent solution to water level control on Hunt Lake. Nehmer Lake is also accessible from the sanctuary. It is approximately in size, and although shallower than Hunt Lake, it has a littoral zone of flooded timber along its margins. The maximum depth is unknown.Spider webs in Hunt Marsh  The flora  The flora found at Enzo Creek have yet to be comprehensively inventoried, as the project would be a colossal undertaking. Tree types include deciduous species such as pin oak, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, aspen, ash, birch, cherry, apple, sassafras, American hornbeam, ironwood, and walnut trees. Coniferous species include jack pine, red pine, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, arborvitae, Scots pine, and blue spruce. Selective harvest of aspen was done in 2003 to improve habitat for ruffed grouse and other upland birds such as the wild turkey. Low impact selective harvest proved to be a successful project. Since 2006, several stands of conifers have been planted for future economic timber value and also to provide dense cover for several wildlife species. Approximately 8,000 red pines were planted in a stand primarily for future economic timber value and 1500 jack pine were planted in a fallow area with poor soil types suitable for jack pine but not conducive to forage plants to serve as a future area of dense cover for wildlife. Cardinal flowerThere are several other tree species including tamarack larch which is known as a deciduous conifer and hence loses its needles each autumn. Staghorn sumac is abundant in many areas of the sanctuary. Elaeagnus umbellata (autumn olive) was planted in the 1950s under the recommendation of the then Michigan Department of Conservation (now the Michigan Department of Natural Resources), as the shrub was believed to be very beneficial to wildlife. It is now know to be invasive, and an area was cut back in 2006 and converted to a hayland. Enzo Creek in October Wildflowers are found in every season except winter. Cardinal flower, Indian paintbrush, touch-me-not, multiflora rose and trout lily serve only as examples. Aquatic flora is abundant and diverse. Wetland species such as narrow leaf cattails, horsetail, and giant reed are abundant. The Hunt Marsh is covered with duckweed for several months in the summer where patches of white water lily can also be found. Poison sumac is common in Hunt Marsh. Winterberry (also known as Michigan holly) is a colorful addition to Hunt Marsh in the winter when the marsh's greenery subsides in late fall. It also provides an abundant forage base for many wild birds.  The fauna  A whitetail fawn at Enzo CreekThe fauna found at Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary is as diverse as its flora. It is the abundance of appropriate habitat which makes it possible to view wildlife within the sanctuary. On any given day, one may see white-tailed deer, fox, bobcat, wild turkey, cottontail rabbit, squirrels (eastern, red, and fox), coyote, raccoon, porcupine, ruffed grouse, and ring-necked pheasant. A black bear sighting is not impossible, as both Newaygo County (6 miles west of Enzo Creek) and Osceola County (10 miles north of Enzo Creek) each have legal hunting seasons for black bear, and many bear seek Mecosta County as a refuge. Conservation Officer Mike Bomay, Michigan Department of Natural ResourcesA hen wild turkey at Enzo Creek In 2007, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources extended the range for bear hunting to include Mecosta County and a bear was relocated from a tree in the City of Big Rapids during the fall of 2013. The most recent species of interest to be identified at Enzo Creek is the northern flying squirrel as a pair was seen gliding from tree to tree in November 2011. The abundance of wildlife is spectacular at the Sanctuary. It is the waterfowl habitat that makes Enzo Creek so unique. In autumn, when waterfowl are migrating, Hunt Marsh and Hunt Lake are home to many species of waterfowl. Most abundant are wood duck, mallards, Canada geese, and teal. Loons also take up residence on Hunt Lake, and their presence is known by their unique cry at twilight, although the birds prefer Townline Lake (located to the east of Enzo Creek) due to its size. Due to the abundance of waterfowl, Ducks Unlimited conducted extensive research on mallard nesting success at Enzo Creek in 2003. As part of the study, 60 mallard hens were decoy trapped in the early spring and surgically implanted with transmitters. Hens were followed via telemetry from the time of implantation to either 30 days after their bood hatch, complete brood loss, or death. Data from this study was instrumental in helping Ducks Unlimited revise their managagment plan for Great Lakes mallard populations. In 2006 one wood duck nesting box was installed at Enzo Creek, and a resident hen successfully hatched two ducklings while taking up residence. In 2007, two additional nesting boxes were installed to help provide optimal nesting habitat. In October 2007 a check was made on one of the nesting boxes installed in the spring, and there was no sign of nesting activity. It is speculated that the abundance of other natural nesting habitat precluded it from use. Hunt Marsh is also home to the great blue heron, the largest in the heron family with a wing span of seven feet. Kingfishers are observed on a frequent basis as they ambush fish, a staple in their diet. Hunt Marsh would not exist without the activity of the world's second-largest rodent: the beaver. Beaver remain very active in the marsh and any novice can identify their trademark \\"stump\\" left behind. Muskrat are also abundant and seen traveling throughout the lakes, ponds, marsh and even Enzo Creek. The northern river otter is also prevalent on Hunt Lake and Hunt Marsh. Able to swim for nearly a mile underwater when disturbed, they often seem to disappear without a trace..Blanding's turtle is a threatened species. When observed, they are without question one of the most amazing creatures to observe as they are often socially playful with one another. Of special note is the river otter's acute sensitivity to any form of environmental pollution, as it generally vacates any area with tainted water quality very quickly. Their existence at Enzo Creek is a testament to the water quality within the nature sanctuary Enzo Creek is home to the Blanding's turtle, which is threatened and even endangered within its range. These turtles do not reach sexual maturity until they are 18‚Äì20 years old and may live to be as old as 70 years. The common snapping turtle can be found in the spring nesting in sandy areas of the preserve. Rarely do they pose a threat if encountered in water, but on land they can be very aggressive if disturbed.Snapping turtle nesting at Enzo Creek Another common amphibian is the Blue-spotted salamander which often uses leaf litter and underbrush as a hideout.Blue-spotted Salamander Hunt Lake harbors a vibrant fishery. The northern pike is at the top of the food chain, and considering it is such a small body of water, Hunt's pike are in balance with the forage available in the lake. Most are in the 3‚Äì5 year class, but much older fish are also found. Largemouth bass are also part of the food pyramid, but to a much lesser extent. Bluegill, yellow perch, and emerald shiner make up the bulk of the forage base. A complete fishery survey had not yet been completed as of 2007. Strangely, a four-year-old muskellunge was identified in Hunt Lake in 2006, and it unclear if this fish was the sole representative of its species or if a small reproductive population exists. Nehmer Lake is similar in resources as Hunt Lake. Hybrid sunfish have been stocked on several occasions. However, their survival in abundance has been curtailed due to predation by northern pike. It is not uncommon to view an American bald eagle soaring low over Hunt Lake or Hunt Marsh. Bald eagles often hunt over the Muskegon River, which is located approximately west of Enzo Creek. Evidence of nesting activity at Enzo Creek was recently observed with the first sighting of a nest under construction in August 2009. In this same survey, several migratory bufflehead were viewed waddling in a pool below one of Hunt Marsh's several beaver dams. Bufflehead are arguably one of the most colorful species of waterfowl which pass through Enzo Creek each spring and fall. En route from the bird's southern winter range to Canada's boreal forest to nest, they are vulnerable to predation by the bald eagle.

The statue, which is tall, was unveiled at the city's Dunbar Park in 2014. History It was at the prestigious DuSable Museum of African American History where Hand first publicly unveiled her work. The unveiling was arranged by the museum's principal founder, Dr. Margaret Taylor-Burroughs who took a personal interest in Hand's work and showcased her during Burrough's historic \\"Lifetime in the Arts\\" retrospective exhibit at the museum. It was during this momentous occasion that she invited Debra Hand on stage and introduced her to a packed audience of art patrons and dignitaries as an emerging-artist with great potential; one that they should watch for on Chicago's fine-art scene. Since the museum presentation, Debra Hand's rise to prominence has continued steadily. Debra Hand's work can be found in diverse collections ranging from Museum collections such as the Smithsonian Anacostia Museum - which acquired a cello by Debra Hand - to corporate and private collections. Hand's body of work is noted for its contemporary and figurative sculptures, dancers, musicians, and stringed instruments. The collection of stringed instruments titled \\"Strings Attached' was created after she was given a real violin by the Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra and challenged to use it as a canvas for a work of art. Debra Hand's sculptures, paintings and stringed-instruments have been filmed by every major network in Chicago and in 2005 she was featured by Harry Porterfield of WLS-TV, as \\"Someone You Should Know.\\" Her work has also been featured in \\"Curators of Culture\\" an Emmy-Award-winning documentary by producer, Rita Coburn Whack. The film traces the history of the South Side Community Arts Center (SSCAC), one of Chicago's great art institutions.

Thus the problem can be broken into two separate parts, which facilitates the design. The first instance of such a principle is in the setting of deterministic linear systems, namely that if a stable observer and a stable state feedback are designed for a linear time-invariant system, then the combined observer and feedback is stable. The separation principle does not hold in general for non-linear systems in general. Another instance of the separation principle arises in the setting of linear stochastic systems, namely that state estimation (possibly nonlinear) together with an optimal state feedback controller designed to minimize a quadratic cost, is optimal for the stochastic control problem with output measurements. When process and observation noise are Gaussian, the optimal solution separates into a Kalman filter and a linear-quadratic regulator. This is known as linear-quadratic- Gaussian control. More generally, under suitable conditions and when the noise is a martingale (with possible jumps), again a separation principle applies and is known as the separation principle in stochastic control. . . . . .. The separation principle also holds for high gain observers used for state estimation of a class of nonlinear systems , a class of nonliear observers known as cubic observers when used in combination with linear state feedback and control of quantum systems.  Proof of separation principle for deterministic LTI systems  Consider a deterministic LTI system: \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{x}(t) & = A x(t) + B u(t) \\\\ y(t) & = C x(t) \\\\end{align} where :u(t) represents the input signal, :y(t) represents the output signal, and :x(t) represents the internal state of the system. We can design an observer of the form :\\\\dot{\\\\hat{x}} = ( A - L C ) \\\\hat{x} + B u + L y \\\\, and state feedback :u(t) = - K \\\\hat{x} \\\\, . Define the error e: :e = x - \\\\hat{x} \\\\, . Then :\\\\dot{e} = (A - L C) e \\\\, :u(t) = - K ( x - e ) \\\\, . Now we can write the closed-loop dynamics as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{x} \\\\ \\\\dot{e} \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A - B K & BK \\\\ 0 & A - L C \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ e \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Since this is triangular, the eigenvalues are just those of A ‚àí BK together with those of A ‚àí LC.Proof can be found in this math.stackexchange . Thus the stability of the observer and feedback are independent. References * Brezinski, Claude. Computational Aspects of Linear Control (Numerical Methods and Algorithms). Springer, 2002.

History=19th and early 20th century history Louis D. Brandeis School of Law began in 1846 as the Law Department of the University of Louisville. For most of the nineteenth century the Law Department remained small and focused on practical education. \\"As late as the 1870s the school still supported a faculty of only three professors, each of whom met classes two days per week for four hours.\\"Cox, Dwayne D., and William J. Morrison, The University of Louisville (2000) Classes were held in the late afternoon to allow students to keep daytime jobs as law clerks. The faculty ignored the casebook method of instruction that was being developed at Harvard Law School at the time, instead encouraging students to visit local courts and offering optional mock court sessions. The \\"school literature even boasted that the faculty consisted of 'practical lawyers' and not professional educators.\\" As a result, prominent faculty members such as James Speed and Peter B. Muir often eschewed their part-time positions in favor of politics or private practice. The Louis D. Brandeis School of Law at the University of Louisville opened in 1846 and was named for Justice Brandeis in 1997. The turn of the twentieth century saw the Law Department finally begin to accept emerging national standards in legal education. In 1909, the school adopted Harvard Law's casebook method. In 1911, the school graduated its first female student, N. Almee Courtright. In 1923, the Law Department officially became the School of Law and hired a full-time professor. The following year University of Louisville President Arthur Younger Ford insisted that students must take some college courses before being admitted to the law school. The UofL School of Law and the Jefferson School of Law Despite these efforts at reform, the students and professors of the School of Law continued to prefer part-time practical education over the national trend towards more formal legal education. This partly reflected the success of and competition from the Jefferson School of Law, which opened in 1905 and offered night classes. Organized by several prominent local attorneys, the part-time professors at the Jefferson School of Law received tuition directly from the students and were responsible for renting classroom space. With students wishing to clerk and part-time professors continuing to practice, both schools were located within walking distance of the courthouse. As the national trend continued towards formal legal education, the Jefferson School of Law found it difficult to manage as a part-time law school. In 1950 the Jefferson School of Law merged with the University of Louisville School of Law. Louis D. Brandeis and the UofL School of Law Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis was a great supporter of the University of Louisville. A native Louisvillian, Brandeis planned to make the university a \\"major center of academic research by creating specialized library and archival collections in such areas as sociology, art, music, and labor.\\" In addition to time and money, Brandeis also donated his personal papers, books, and pamphlets, numbering over 250,000 items. He was also instrumental in getting Supreme Court briefs and a collection of Justice John Marshall Harlan's papers deposited in the law school library.Louis Brandeis In honor of Brandeis, the University of Louisville School of Law changed its name to the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law in 1997. The Brandeis Law Library owns a limited edition print of Andy Warhol's portrait of Brandeis which is on display in the library's main reading room. The ashes of Brandeis and his wife Alice Goldmark Brandeis are buried underneath the law school portico. His ashes are buried approximately fifty yards away from Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. Today True to its history, the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law has retained a strong focus on practical legal education. The school offers students a chance to gain experience at its law clinic, on moot court teams, in skills competitions, and on three student-edited law journals. As part of the Samuel L. Greenebaum Public Service Program, the school also requires all students to complete 30 hours of law-related public service. The school has several pre-professional student-run organizations, including the Student Trial Lawyers Association, International Law Society, Student Health Law Association, Environmental Law Society, and The Brand (intellectual property). In addition to pre- professional student organizations, there are also a number of student-run social and political organizations on campus. A partial list of these includes the Federalist Society, the American Constitution Society, Lambda Law Caucus, Black Students Association, Asian-Pacific Law Students Association, Jewish Law Students Association, Christian Legal Society, and Woman's Law Caucus. The Law Library supports the curriculum and research needs of the school's faculty and students, and is open to the university community, practicing bar, and the general public. Deans of Louis D.

This feature can be found all around the world, and it represents the final stage in the boundary between continents and the deepest part of the ocean. The environment in the continental rise is quite unique, and many oceanographers study it extensively in the hopes of learning more about the ocean and geologic history. At the bottom of the continental slope, one will find the continental rise, an underwater hill composed of tons of accumulated sediments. The general slope of the continental rise is between 0.5 degrees and 1.0 degrees. Deposition of sediments at the mouth of submarine canyons may form enormous fan-shaped accumulations called submarine fans on both the continental slope and continental rise. Beyond the continental rise stretches the abyssal plain, an extremely deep and flat area of the sea floor. The abyssal plain hosts many unique life forms which are uniquely adapted to survival in its cold, high pressure, and dark conditions. The flatness of the abyssal plain is interrupted by massive underwater mountain chains near the tectonic boundaries of the Earth's plates. The sediments are mostly sand and pieces of coral or rock.

The Miami Bridge carries Route 41. The Miami Bridge was built in 1939, and its deck was replaced in 1983 as part of a rehabilitation project. The old bridge's main cantilever span was 474.7 feet, while the two anchor spans were each 415 feet in length, resulting in a total cantilever truss length of 1304.7 feet. There were 11 approach spans, including four Warren deck truss spans, three on the northern approach and one on the southern approach. All remaining approach spans were steel stringer (multi-beam/girder) spans. Total bridge length including approach spans is 2,071.9 feet. The bridge's deck width is 23.0 feet and it has vertical clearance of 16.5 feet. The bridge was constructed with the assistance of the Federal Administration of Public Works also known as the Public Works Administration. Sverdrup and Parcel were consulting engineers for the structure, and Massman Construction Company was the contractor. The original plans for the bridge show plans for the original wooden toll building that was once located on the bridge. According to the plans, the toll building was painted white, featured wooden Slow and Stop signs, and included a cast iron stove for heating. The Miami Bridge has been listed as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. According to Clayton B Fraser who conducted Missouri's 1992 Historic Bridge Inventory, the Miami Bridge was eligible for the National Register of Historic Places as an \\"outstanding, large-scale example of steel truss construction, located on important great river crossing.\\" Despite its historic significance, Missouri Department of Transportation decided against rehabilitating the bridge and instead has decided to demolish the bridge's superstructure and erect a new bridge using the piers and abutment of the old bridge. The project will begin with the bridge's closure, scheduled for October 5, 2009.

He was born in Pennsylvania and currently resides in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. He is well known for his transformation of bible verses into pieces art. Timothy has published books, released single prints, been featured in museums, as well as having features within churches. Through years of experience, Timothy experiments with new styles and typefaces to represent what art he makes.  Early life  Timothy is the husband to Nancy Botts and the father of three children. As a child, Botts felt like an outcast, until he had gotten inspiration to try art. This inspiration was from his first-grade teacher, Mrs. Stanton, located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Mrs. Stanton recognized the artistic ability that Timothy had and had faith in it. She continued as Timothy's art teacher throughout his elementary years and followed him into high school. During his sixth-grade year, Botts had to do a poster project for school fair. For his project, he used a lettering book that had all different lettering styles that piqued his interest. In the following year, Timothy attended junior high where he met his now wife Nancy. Tim and Nancy dated through high school and went separate ways before going off to college. After attending high school, he was admitted and attended Carnegie Mellon University where he was still pursuing his art. During his freshman year at Carnegie Mellon, he was first introduced to calligraphy after having needed to take it for his graphic design major. Right after college, Timothy and Nancy married. Rather than being drafted to Vietnam, Timothy and Nancy were sent to Japan for three years where the two taught the Japanese some conversational English and where Botts took Japanese brush writing for five weeks.  Career  Throughout Timothy's career, he has formed his own font, or what he refers to as a visual language with the use of colors, letter styles, letter paths, and contrast and repetition. One of his daughters, along with her husband, had adopted three black children which gave Timothy more reason to create a new visual language that fit with African culture . Timothy used a mixture of Runes styled calligraphy as well as ancient African scripts he came across from some research of Saki Mafundikwa. He also included 19th century American adaptations of Black Letter, Roundhand, early 20th century Bookhand, as well as urban graffiti. Timothy has been given multitude of opportunities to draw on walls of churches and other places that inhabit places of worship with selected murals of scriptures that can be found at Good Shepard Lutheran, Cornerstone Church, Naperville Bible Church, Trinity Church of the Nazarene, St. Francis House High School in Wheaton and Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove. Timothy's art can be found in many formats other than walls which can be found in provided publishings. Timothy's past teacher has inspired him to return the favor and instruct others in calligraphy. Timothy's teaching can be found at the College of Du Page and an intermediate class at The Fine Line in St. Charles. Occasionally you can find Timothy on one of the six weekends workshops he hosts in other parts of the country or his workshop he hosts at the International Calligraphy Convention.

Norriss Indulgent parents; Alienist Says they Make their Children Egomaniacs, July 24, 1913, The New York Times Someone suffering from this extreme egocentric focus is an egomaniac. Egomania as a condition, while not a classified personality disorder, is considered psychologically abnormal. The term egomania is often used by laypersons in a pejorative fashion to describe an individual who is perceived as intolerably self-centered. The clinical condition that most resembles egomania, and most often associated with is narcissistic personality disorder, though they differ vastly according to the individual's responses to others.Gretchen Reevy et al eds., Encyclopedia of Emotions: Volume I (2010) p. 217 History Egomania was brought into polemical prominence at the end of the 19th century by Max Nordau, one of the first critics who perceived the centrality of the concept of egoism for an understanding of Modernism, with criticism on the ideology of egomania'.Jean- Michel Rabat√©, James Joyce and the Politics of Egoism (2001) p. 27 Nordau distinguished egoism from the egomania. He described egoism as a lack of amiability while maintaining the ability to look after oneself, and egomania as a condition where one does not see things as they are, does not understand the world, and cannot take up a right attitude towards it.Max Simon Nordau, Degeneration (1895) p. 243 Nordau's attack was aimed at the avant-garde of the fin de si√®cle. His describes the self-proclaimed geniuses as criminals & madmen obsessed with culte de moi (the cult of self).Rabat√©, p. 29 Over a century later, the term egomania re-appeared with a positive gloss to mark the post-modern quest for success and celebrity. \\"Self-confidence is the key to all success...\\" By contrast, reticent personalities may be labelled: it may well be a form of egomania, if you aren't willing to take a chance\\".Michael Flocker, The Fame Game (2005) p. 62 Substance abuse Egomania has also been linked with alcoholism.James Graham, Vessels of Rage, Engines of Power (1994) p. 10 A recovering alcoholic may well look back at the past as \\"the land of self-loathing, egomania, and decay\\".Anne Lamott, \\"Thirst\\", in Autumn Stephens ed., Roar Softly and Carry a Great Lipstick (2004) p. 6 The danger with the egomaniac is always that 'underneath the apparent over-confidence and bravado lies a fragile personality', driven by \\"grandiose fantasies of boundless success or power or perfect love\\"Reevy, p. 217 which cannot be fulfilled.

He is best known for his 2007 film Bangkok Love Story, that won him the Grand Prize (International Competition) at the Brussels International Independent Film Festival. Biography=Career Poj began his career in the 1980s as an advertising sales manager for Ter-Kab-Chan Magazine, eventually becoming the magazine's chief editor. His work on the magazine enabled him to scout out and groom many of the Thai teen movie stars of the era. He started working in the Thai film industry in 1992, working as an assistant director on Sa-Daew-Haew by Five Star Production. He made his directorial debut in 1995 with Crazy, which was about a character from a Chinese martial arts television series who finds himself in the real world of modern-day Thailand. Next was Bullet Teen (1998), a drama about four troubled urban youths. Go-Six, his 2000 romantic drama about a love triangle involving a young man and two women was scandalous at the time because of the ambiguous sexuality of one of the women characters. Poj returned to the scene in 2003 with Cheerleader Queens, about a group of teenage Thai transvestites, or kathoey, who become high school cheerleaders. In 2004, he shifted to RS Film, again tackling kathoeys with the crime comedy Spicy Beauty Queen of Bangkok, starring Winai Kraibutr as the leader of a gang of transvestite bank robbers. He next moved to Sahamongkol Film International to direct the childhood drama Beautiful Wonderful Perfect, about a girl who befriends a boy with Down syndrome. Also entitled Er rer, the film was critically acclaimed in Thailand and was screened at overseas film festivals. His followup was an action comedy, Chai Lai, about five female crimefighters.

After completing a second fighter airfield at Turtle Bay they began constructing two bomber fields, one at Palikulo Bay known as Bomber Field No. 1 and the other at Pekoa, known as Bomber Field No. 2. Working in cooperation with a company of the US Army 810th Engineer Aviation Battalion, the 7th CB cleared, graded, and surfaced a by coral runway on the site of a prewar plantation. The 15th CB arrived on Santo on 13 October 1942 and extended the runway to with pierced steel planking over a coral base, and built taxiways, revetments, and miscellaneous structures. The completed airfield was operational in December 1942 and was known as \\"Bomber Field No. 2\\" or \\"Pekoa Field\\".

Postwar Luganville Airfield was used as a civilian airstrip until the early 1970s, however as it was on higher ground it was often clouded in and so it was decided to move all operations to the former Pekoa Airfield/Bomber Field No.2 which became Santo-Pekoa International Airport.

They have a total length of between , and six entrances. The Buchan Cave Reserve has been transferred back to the Gunaikurnai Nation and is jointly managed with the state. The limestone rock at Buchan was laid down during the Devonian period about 300 - 400 million years ago. At the time, the sea covered this area of East Gippsland which was alive with shellfish and coral. Their remains were deposited in layers and over the years compacted to form limestone. The caves were formed by solution of the limestone.Visit Victoria Buchan Caves The Buchan Caves are located approximately east northeast (or five hours' drive) from Melbourne, along the Princes Highway, north of Lakes Entrance.  Tourism  The caves are a major tourist attraction for Buchan and for East Gippsland. Daily tours are conducted in Royal Cave and Fairy Cave. Royal Cave features calcite-rimmed pools and in Fairy Cave features elaborate stalactites and stalagmites. Both caves are lit, have walkways and have a constant temperature of making it a comfortable temperature all year round. The Buchan Caves are situated within the Buchan Caves Reserve. There is access to short and long walks in the surrounding bushland and the nearby Snowy River National Park. The area is surrounded by trees and wildlife, including over 60 species of birds including bellbirds and lyrebirds. Amenities include campsites and cabins, picnic ground, playground and an information centre.  History =Aboriginal history The traditional and current custodians of the Buchan Caves and its surrounds are the Australian Aboriginal Gunaikurnai Nation. European history The caves were accidentally made a reserve in 1887, as they were on land set aside for stock camping. The government commissioned an exploration of the land and, on the recommendation of the geologist Albert Ernest Kitson, reserved the area to protect the caves (for geological and limited recreational use). In 1907, Frank Moon reported back about the Fairy Cave which was then opened to the European public later that year, though Aboriginal people were not allowed. Royal Cave was mapped in 1910 by Frederick Wilson and after an entrance tunnel was excavated, it was opened to white visitors in 1913. The Caves Reserve was set out and planted mostly in the late 1930s.Parks Victoria Buchan Caves Reserve The site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is included a Heritage Overlay.

It connects the 15th and 16th arrondissement, passing through the √éle aux Cygnes. The bridge, made of steel, is the second to have stood at the site. It was constructed between 1903 and 1905, replacing an earlier bridge that had been erected in 1878. An arch bridge, it is 237 metres (777 ft) long and 24.7 metres (81 ft) wide. It was designed by the architect Jean-Camille Formig√©, who also designed the Viaduc d'Austerlitz, the Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil, as well as the park below the Sacr√©-C≈ìur; he also restored the Roman amphitheatre in Arles and the Roman theatre in Orange. Structure Location on the Seine The bridge has two levels: one for motor vehicles and pedestrians, the other being a viaduct (Viaduc de Passy) built above the first one, through which passes Line 6 of the Paris M√©tro. The railway viaduct is supported by metal colonnades, except where it passes over the √éle aux Cygnes, where it rests on a masonry arch. Many commemorative plates decorate the viaduct bridge, including several dedicated to soldiers fallen in Belgium during the Second World War. In addition, the central arch of the viaduct, at the level of the island, is decorated with four monumental stone statues in high-relief: figures of Science and Labour by Jules-Felix Coutan, Electricity and Commerce by Jean Antoine Injalbert. The road level of the bridge extends out in a belvedere where it passes over the √éle aux Cygnes which covers the eastern end of the island. Here stands a statue named La France renaissante. Name Originally named the Pont de Passy (after the former commune of Passy, which it reaches), it was renamed in 1948 to commemorate the Battle of Bir Hakeim, fought by Free French forces against the German Afrika Korps in 1942.

In 2013, Melton was carted from the field during the third game on September 22, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with a left knee injury. A Lachman test on the field was indicative of an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and an MRI was scheduled.Wilson, Aaron (September 23, 2013), NFLPost.com. \\"Bears worried Melton may have torn ACL\\" On September 23, Melton was ruled out for the remainder of the 2013 season, and was placed on injured reserve four days later. Dallas Cowboys On March 18, 2014, Melton signed a 1-year contract along with incentives, including a team option for 3 more years with the Dallas Cowboys, hoping he could regain his Pro Bowl form. After missing the last 13 games of the 2013 season with a torn ACL, he struggled in training camp as his knee recovered and he worked through a groin strain. Although he began the season as a starter at defensive tackle, injuries forced him into a pass-rushing role, with Tyrone Crawford passing him on the depth chart. His production faded as the year went on and his season ended with a bone bruise on his right knee and being placed on the injured reserve list before the playoffs. He finished with 5 sacks (registered in the first 9 games), 20 tackles, 17 quarterback pressures, 4 passes defensed and 2 fumble recoveries. On February 14, 2015, the Cowboys declined to exercise the contract's three year option, allowing him to become a free agent on March 14, 2015. Tampa Bay Buccaneers On March 12, 2015, Melton agreed to terms and signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reuniting him with his old head coach Lovie Smith. He was a backup that was used at defensive tackle and defensive end, posting 30 tackles (second highest mark in his career), 2 sacks, 2 passes defensed and 2 fumble recoveries. Denver Broncos On August 21, 2016, Melton signed a one-year deal with the Denver Broncos. On September 3, 2016, he was released by the Broncos. Personal life On June 1, 2007, while a Junior at the University of Texas, Melton was arrested and charged with intoxicated driving in downtown Austin, Texas. In 2013, Melton was involved in an altercation at a bar in the Dallas area, but the criminal charges were ultimately dropped by the prosecution.

Overview Lonorore began as a grass airstrip, capable of accommodating 20-seater Twin Otter aircraft in good conditions, although it was frequently unusable due to waterlogging in wet weather. The airport is in the middle of an old coconut plantation, and was first built as a private airstrip in colonial times by the plantation owner. The airport was upgraded in 2008-2009 with a longer, tarmacked runway capable of operating in most weather conditions and being used by larger ATR aircraft, though in practice the airport is still serviced only by Twin Otters, together with Islanders and small charter planes. Lonorore is used for Air Vanuatu domestic flights to Port Vila and Santo, sometimes via Ambae. Schedules change regularly but there are typically flights on two or three days of the week. Between April and June the airport caters for significant numbers of day trippers from Port Vila who come to watch the weekly land-diving ceremonies. Near the airport is a small post office (currently defunct) and an aid post. On flight days, women often set up markets near the airport, selling homegrown vegetables and homecooked food. Lonorore is one of two airports on Pentecost, the other being Sara in the north. Lonorore is a long distance from Sara by road, but is occasionally used as an alternative airport by passengers from northern Pentecost when Sara is closed due to adverse weather or volcanic ashfall, as Sara is more vulnerable to these disruptions than Lonorore.

With lyrics loosely based on Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker's loss of virginity, the song saw some controversy for its sexual topic. Released as the second single from His 'n' Hers, the song reached number 33 in the UK, becoming the band's first Top 40 hit in that country. The single was accompanied by a lengthy music video featuring celebrities discussing how they lost their virginity. The song has since become one of the band's most famous songs and has seen critical acclaim. The track also notably served as the band's opening song on their reunion tour setlist. Background \\"Do You Remember the First Time?\\" features lyrics about losing one's virginity written by Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. Cocker loosely based his lyrics on the moment that he lost his virginity at the age of nineteen; he reportedly lost it with the purpose of losing it as a teenager. Cocker later recalled of the moment, \\"I have no regrets about the first person I had sex with. We were both virgins, so neither of us were under any pressure to perform. It probably took me a long time to get any good at it, to get reasonable at sex... I still don't know.\\" Because of the song's lyrical content, the band saw some backlash. Cocker explained, \\"We got a bit of stick for the fact that 'Do You Remember The First Time?' was about sex, but it just seemed like a good subject, because it interests everybody. I mean, everybody's had a first time, or if they haven't, they're always thinking about it. Everyone's got a story to tell.\\" Musically, the song featured uncredited contributions to then-touring guitarist Mark Webber, who, after years of collaborating with Pulp, would join the band in 1995. He recalled, \\"I did write part of 'Do You Remember The First Time?' [which] caused a bit of trouble for a while, I think, so I shut up about it. It was all a bit complicated, I wasn't really sure if I wanted to be more involved or not.\\" Lyrics The lyrics to \\"Do You Remember the First Time?\\" discuss losing one's virginity, though it also features the narrator pleading with a girl who is seeing someone else. As Stereogum's Ryan Leas writes, \\"The title of course always pointed towards losing your virginity, but the narrative of the song also had to do with a man addressing his lover who keeps returning to another man.\\" Because of the song's title and its use as the band's opening song during its reunion shows, it has been described by Leas as \\"a rallying cry for the Pulp reunion.\\" Brad Sanders, also of Stereogum, wrote of the song's resonance during the band's reunion, \\"By starting their shows with 'Do You Remember the First Time?,' Pulp concedes that reunion tours are essentially nostalgia trips for a large portion of the audience. If you do remember the first time you saw Pulp, you want to relive it. If you don't, all you want is a credible facsimile.\\" Sometimes a \\"sanitised\\" version of the song was aired on TV and radio, with the lyric \\"I don't care if you screw him\\" changed to \\"I don't care if you knew him\\". Release \\"Do You Remember the First Time\\" was released 21 March 1994 as the second single from the album, after \\"Lipgloss.\\" The single charted at number 33 in the UK Singles Chart, the highest position the band reached to that point and the first Pulp single to reach the UK Top 40. Cocker recalled of the single's performance, \\"Unfortunately, we didn't go on 'Top of the Pops' because they decided to have S*M*A*S*H on instead. That was disappointing, but still the movement was up.\\" The B-sides to the French single‚Äîacoustic versions of \\"Joyriders\\", \\"Dogs are Everywhere\\" and \\"Razzmatazz\\"‚Äîwere later released in the UK as the B-sides of CD2 of \\"Common People\\". Music video To promote the release of the track, lead singer Jarvis Cocker asked fans to recount stories of their own \\"first time\\" sexual experiences. Cocker explained of the video's concept, \\"People imagine that celebrities have this idealised life. Again, it's the thing about sex being shown in this idealised light and really you should do it on a beach at sunset and violins are going to be playing. And somehow, if you do it in the back of a Ford Cortina then you've not done it properly. These famous people, all their introductions were as fumbling and untidy as anyone else's.\\" A short film was produced by Cocker and Steve Mackey, featuring loss of virginity stories from celebrities including Justine Frischmann, Jo Brand and John Peel; Cocker later called Peel \\"one of the nicest people I've ever met.\\" This was made available on the Sorted for Films & Vids video, and later the Pulp Hits DVD. Cocker recalled of the video, \\"I thought maybe people might try and make a joke out of it and not answer very honestly. But everybody answered very honestly indeed. I kind of knew these people vaguely before, but not properly so it's a good way of getting to know somebody by talking about that kind of subject.\\" The band had also asked Stephen Fry to appear, but were rejected. Cocker stated, \\"We got told by his agent really gruffly, 'He does NOT talk about his private life!' Oh, okay, you know.\\" Reception \\"Do You Remember the First Time\\" has seen critical acclaim and has been labelled by many writers as one of Pulp's best songs. Spin called the song one of the band's best songs, while Drowned in Sound called the song \\"the most gorgeously spiteful kiss-off ever put down on record.\\" In an otherwise critical review of His 'n' Hers, Matt Messbarger of The Chicago Tribune noted that \\"the crooning of Jarvis Cocker about lost youth has its campy charms\\" on the track. NME readers ranked the song as Pulp's fourth best in a fan vote, calling it \\"a giddy anthem for those who didn‚Äôt feel they had a voice\\" and concluding, \\"Who better to articulate the horror of a bad sexual encounter than Mr. Cocker?\\" Stereogum's Ryan Leas ranked it as the band's fifth best, while Orange County Weekly named the song as the number three Pulp song for beginners.

It generally entails special equipment to protect occupants, because there is a high risk of infection.  Etymology  The term hot zone was likely coined during the Cold War where it described locations rendered hazardous due to nuclear contamination. The term was later extended to areas or locations considered to be hazardous such as Level-4 biosafety labs, places in which there is active conflict, and so forth. The term hot zone was popularized by the 1995 book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston, and its film adaptation Outbreak, released the same year. Types of hot zones=Biological Hazardous biological agents can induce a hot zone, as occupants are in danger of becoming infected. These biological contaminants can include many things. Some common examples would be bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Many times these are used as biological warfare, or biowarfare, agents with the intent to harm. Precautions are taken in a gradient level of protection. In 2009, the outbreak of swine influenza happened in most places of the whole world. The swine influenza originated from a Mexican woman, and it was transmitted from person to person by air with a rapid speed. North America and Mexico were the first places to be affected by the virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 14,142 deaths of swine influenza, and 1,311,522 people had this virus in their bodies in 2009. Spain, China, the United States, and South Korea are considered to be hot zones of swine influenza. There were 155,051 people who had this virus in Spain, 120,498 in China, 107,939 in United State and 101,182 in South Korea. The people in those areas can very easily get this virus. The virus is transmittable through the air, such as through coughing, sneezing or touching something containing the virus. Epidemics of acute respiratory disease of pigs are caused by the virus disease, swine influenza. Swine influenza belongs to the type A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The patients with swine influenza virus have symptoms consisting of headaches, chills, fatigue, fever, cough and sore throat. = Malaria = In Peru deforestation is leading to the distribution of Malaria. With the forests being destroyed the wildlife is as well, leaving malaria looking for a new host. Malaria is a very dangerous disease, so much so that vaccinations are required for traveling into places suspected of housing the disease. Malaria is a disease that is found predominantly in third world, low-income countries. Malaria along with other insect diseases are learning to adapt to life in the city. In Peru a port city called Iquitos the population has been growing in the past 10 years making it prime for mosquitoes to flourish. These mosquitoes also bring in Dengue Fever, in which 5 percent of its victims will die. = Clean water = With an increased world population in the early 21st century water borne diseases have become the most pressing hot zone. With a lot of the worlds population moving into the city it is hard separating sanitation and clean water. In the early 1990s a cholera epidemic broke out in a fishing village in Lima, Peru. Many thought that this was coming from the seafood, but it was really from the water the seafood was cleaned with. Cholera starts when infected human waste seeps into the water supply of a community. Not having a clean water supply is something that affects a third world country the most, though there are cases of poor water in the States. In Maryland's Chesapeake Bay fisherman have seen a decline in their catch over the last couple of years. A few years ago fisherman of Maryland's Chesapeake Bay area started noticing lesions on the crabs and fish they caught and soon the fisherman were sick themselves. Industrial waste, sewage and pesticides have slowly sunk into the Chesapeake Bay over the past decade. Chemical Hazardous chemicals can induce a hot zone, as occupants are in danger of it disrupting their biological processes. For example, if while driving down a highway, an oil tanker gets into a car accident and spills its load on the pavement and surrounding grass areas, those areas affected will be considered hot zones. To correct these incidents, fire departments will deploy their HAZMAT, or hazardous materials, teams to reder the area safe once again. These types of spills can be harmful to people and to the environment because they are not meant to be there and therefore contaminate the land. Nuclear Radioactive contamination can create a hot zone, as occupants are in danger of being exposed to radiation. In March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and its accompanying tsunami struck a nuclear power station in Fukushima Daiichi area of northeastern Japan. A number of safety systems were badly damaged by the tsunami leading to a loss-of-coolant (LOCA) event which damaged the nuclear core of several reactors. The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) announced that the subsequent release of radioactivity into atmosphere qualified as the highest level of radiological event scale, INES level 7. The radioactive materials released in Fukushima Daiichi area are mostly iodine-131 and cesium-137. The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency estimated the cancer consequence of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. From the government statistics, around the two million people who live within 80 kilometre radius of the nuclear plate, and about one million people live in areas contaminated with cesium-137. = Land contamination = The loss of coolant further caused hydrogen explosions in the facility. As the fuel temperature went up, zirconium alloy cladding reacted with the hot steam removing oxygen from water molecule, leaving hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas was ultimately vented off into the reactor building, because of the design of the facility, mixing with air and creating an explosive environment. = Disease = Diseases are estimated that thyroid cancer is the main cancer which affected by the nuclear accident. High amount of radioactive iodine mainly causes thyroid cancer, and most of the cases are the result of releasing iodine-131. If people consume food and water contaminated by iodine-131, iodine-131 (which has a half-life of eight days) concentrates in the thyroid. The most contaminated food and drink are raw milk and vegetables in Fukushima Daiichi area. Milk production was blocked after six days of the nuclear explosion. Nuclear accidents are very serious matters. As you can see from the above statements, they can cause massive panic, disease, and not to mention the fact that humans and other organisms may not be able to inhabit the affected area for many years to come. A perfect example of this is the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, Ukraine. Chernobyl is near Pripyat, Ukraine and also the country of Belarus. Chernobyl is now a ghost town. They had a malfunction with their nuclear power plant, and now there is still a hot zone there. This hot zone actually has a name, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Violence Violence can induce a hot zone, as occupants are subject to attacks, crossfire, or even direct fire targeted at them specifically. The most identifiable violent hot zones are in war zones, such as the war in Afghanistan. Soldiers are constantly fighting with other soldiers and insurgents to attempt to accomplish tactical goals. Hot zones are not good places to appear as a member of either of the opposing teams, because one may be prone to attacks or capture. Although war zones may have the most targeted attacks, crime ridden neighborhoods are the most common areas for crossfire to occur, and subsequently the most victims of crossfire are here.

The name, given by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1928, means \\"ancient Saniwa from Canada\\".  Description  Palaeosaniwa was roughly comparable to a large monitor lizard (Varanidae) in size. Measuring around in length,\\"Palaeosaniwa\\" from James Gurney: The World of Dinosaurs it is among the largest terrestrial lizards known from the Mesozoic era (though Asprosaurus may compete with it in sizeThe first lizard fossil (Reptilia: Squamata) from the Mesozoic of South Korea. - Cretaceous Research 55:292-302. - J.-Y. Park, S. E. Evans & M. Huh - 2015.). It is similar to modern varanid lizards (particularly the Komodo dragon) in having bladelike teeth with minute serrations. These teeth would have been effective for seizing and cutting large prey items, and suggest that Palaeosaniwa fed on other vertebrates. Adult Palaeosaniwa would have been large enough to prey on any of the avialans or mammals known from the time, small non-avian dinosaurs, and the eggs and juveniles of large dinosaurs. Distribution Palaeosaniwa was originally described from the late Campanian of Alberta. More recently it has been reported from the late Campanian of Montana, and the late Maastrichtian of Montana and Wyoming. It is known primarily from isolated teeth and vertebrae, but two partial skeletons have also been discovered. The type species, P. canadensis, is from Alberta. Although the Maastrichtian Palaeosaniwa has traditionally been referred to this species, it succeeds it by roughly ten million years. Given the distance in time between these animals, they are likely to represent distinct species, but the available fossils are too incomplete to be certain. Relationships Palaeosaniwa is a member of the Platynota, a group that includes the monitor lizards (Varanidae) and Gila monsters (Helodermatidae). Originally, it was thought to be a member of the Varanidae, but has also been interpreted as a relative of the Helodermatidae.Michael Joseph Balsai, The phylogenetic position of Palaeosaniwa and the early evolution of the Platynotan (Varanoid) anguimorphs (January 1, 2001). Univ. of Pennsylvania - Electronic Dissertations. Paper AAI3031637. The most recent analysis places Palaeosaniwa outside of either Varanidae or Helodermatidae, as a stem member of the Varanoidea. Its precise affinities remain poorly understood, but it may be related to other Late Cretaceous, North American carnivorous lizards such as Parasaniwa, Paraderma, Labrodioctes, and Cemeterius.

The tournament took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was a single-elimination tournament with four rounds. Villanova and Connecticut tied for the best regular season conference record. Based on tie- breakers, Connecticut was awarded the #1 seed. The Syracuse Orange won the tournament for the second consecutive season and fifth time overall, and were awarded an automatic bid to the 2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. As a 9-seed, the Orange are the lowest seeded team to win the Big East Tournament, and became the first school to win four games in the tournament. Gerry McNamara of Syracuse was given the Dave Gavitt Trophy, awarded to the tournament's most outstanding player. Syracuse's Run This tournament is best remembered for Syracuse's improbable run to the championship as a #9 seed, with McNamara pulling off excellent 3-point shooting and some improbable buzzer beaters and last-second shots to lead them. In the first game, after Devan Downey of Cincinnati stole the inbounds pass with ten seconds left and was fouled, he made one of two to put the Bearcats up two points. However, with just a half second left, McNamara made a running one-handed three-pointer to secure the victory, 74‚Äì73. After jumping out to a big lead against Connecticut in the second game, Uconn battled back for much of the game until they finally took their first lead of the game with 30 seconds to play. Incredibly, McNamara was the hero for Syracuse again, hitting a 30-foot three-pointer with 5 seconds left to send the game into overtime. The Orange went on to win 86‚Äì84, holding off the Huskies on a last-second effort. McNamara finished with thirteen assists, ten in the first half alone. They faced Georgetown in the semifinals in their attempt to become the first team to win the Big East Tournament as one of the teams forced to play on the first day, requiring four wins in a row. The Hoyas went up early, holding a fifteen-point lead at the half. McNamara sat out for ten minutes because of a nagging groin injury. Surprising everyone, McNamara came out in the second half and drained five three-pointers, including one with 45 seconds left and the Orange down four. Demetris Nichols knocked away the inbounds pass for Georgetown, allowing McNamara to take possession and rush down the floor with time running out. He passed to an open Eric Devendorf who laid the winning shot in with 1.5 seconds to go. The Orange had advanced to the finals, beating Georgetown, 58‚Äì57. After improbably winning three straight games either in overtime or by one point, they got a slightly easier win in the finals against Pittsburgh, winning 65‚Äì61. The Orange led most of the game, but midway through the second half, the Panthers had taken the lead. McNamara quickly made a three-point shot after that and Josh Wright made four clutch free throws in the final minute to secure the historic championship. Syracuse had finished just 7‚Äì9 in the Big East that year, and would have likely been left out of the NCAA tournament had they not pulled off at least three of the four wins.

Set for three-part treble choir and organ, it was first performed at London's Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral on 22 July of the same year.Roseberry, 11. Britten composed the Mass for George Malcolm's retirement as organist and choirmaster at Westminster:Roseberry, 11. the printed dedication reads \\"For George Malcolm and the boys of Westminster Cathedral Choir\\".Britten, 1. It was Britten's first and only setting of the Mass. Malcolm's live recording, from a service at the cathedral, lasts ten minutes. Liturgy Britten's Missa brevis contains only four movements, omitting the Credo, hence the name brevis, short. The omission is notable because Mass at Westminster Cathedral would have included this movement.Peloquin, 133. The piece rather seems predisposed towards the liturgy of the Church of England or the Protestant Episcopal Church of America, which often omit the sung Credo.Choral and Organ Guide, 18. In the Sanctus, Britten writes an optional transition between the first Hosanna and the Benedictus. This serves two functions: 1) it allows the sections to be elided seamlessly if the work is performed non-liturgically, and 2) it allows the section to be easily cut altogether for certain liturgical purposes, e.g. in the United States, the Benedictus was not officially approved by canon law and many Episcopal churches omitted it. Music The Kyrie immediately presents the D major / F-sharp major relationship that is a unifying element of the work, occurring also in the Gloria and the Sanctus.Roseberry, 11. F-sharp is the key center despite the key signature.Roseberry, 11. The movement is in ternary form, with the central \\"Christe\\" inverting the melody of the Kyrie. The Gloria is based on a 7/8 ostinato derived from the incipit Gloria XV that would be intoned by the celebrant in some liturgical settings.Peloquin, 132. The additive time signature allows for various patterns of word stress.Roseberry, 13. The central \\"Qui Tollis\\" juxtaposes F major against the prevailing D / F-sharp bitonality and contrasts short phrases for solo voice with those for tutti unison. The Sanctus in 3/2 presents a twelve-tone melodic line dominated by the interval of a perfect fourth, and shared between the three enharmonically overlapping voices. D Lydian, F-sharp major, and F major are all suggested (the three prominent keys of the Gloria).Roseberry, 14. The \\"Pleni sunt caeli\\" section features free imitative polyphony in the voices with the original twelve-tone melody transferred to the organ pedals. The Benedictus is a bitonal duet for two soloists, the first in G major, and the second in C major. This results in parallel fourths and false relations between F-sharp and F natural. Following is an exultant contraction of all of the material preceding the Benedictus into just five measures.Peloquin, 132. The Agnus Dei, marked \\"Slow and Solemn\\", is in D minor. In 5/4 time, an organ pedal ostinato of rising thirds outlines the interval of a minor ninth.Roseberry, 16. The threefold repeat of the Agnus Dei text gains intensity with each repetition through rising dynamics and register. The closing Dona Nobis Pacem builds to fortissimo; it is set with hammered repeated notes and overlapping intervals of a second between the voices. The organ ostinato finally breaks its pattern for the last two bars and the chorus closes with a pianississimo D minor triad. NotesReferences *\\"A Missa Brevis By Benjamin Britten\\".

History=Gunderson Inc. In 1919, Chester Ellsworth Gunderson, son of a Swedish immigrant, founded the Wire Wheel Sales & Service Company, acting as a distribution partner for the Houk Company, Pennsylvania, a manufacturer of wire wheels. His brother Alvin Gunderson joined the company in 1923. In 1925, the company became the Wheel & Rim Service Inc.E.M. Lundquist et al, \\"Gunderson : A history of an Oregon company\\", Chap. 1 & 2 By the 1930s, the company expanded in other automobile parts servicing. After an unsuccessful foray into the fertilizer distribution business, the company began to manufacture trailers, the equipment for which required an investment of over $12,000. In 1937, they began manufacturing dual-axle trailers, suitable for on- and off-road use. The new design of trailers was a commercial success and in 1938, the incorporated company Gunderson Bros. was formed, with its factory in Linnton, Portland, Oregon. In 1941, the company began building ships. The company distributed, installed and pioneered the use of General Motors diesel engines. In 1938, the company was near bankruptcy, in part due to the effects of the Great Depression, and in part due to the Gundersons' own financial mismanagement. The company's main creditor took control of their accounts, and began to pay their suppliers. However, the company's financial position remained tenuous.E.M. Lundquist et al, \\"Gunderson : A history of an Oregon company\\", Chap. 4 At the beginning of the Second World War, the company handled assembly work for the U.S. Navy; a 1941 a loan from the Navy enabled Gunderson Bros. to build a shipyard. During the same period, continued debts caused the Federal Government to take the original factory as security. Gunderson also constructed lifeboats, landing crafts and other vessels, as well as trailers for the U.S. Army. A shortage of manpower also led to the first women working in the construction sheds.E.M.

Lundquist et al, \\"Gunderson : A history of an Oregon company\\", Chap. 9 Construction of marine vessels such as tugs, barges, trawlers and more specialised craft continued in the 1950s and 1960s, and by the 1970s the company was building vessels as long as and as wide as .E.M.

Lundquist et al, \\"Gunderson : A history of an Oregon company\\", Chap. 13 In 1965, the Gundersons sold their company to the FMC Corporation.

Lundquist et al, \\"Gunderson : A history of an Oregon company\\", appendix Time Line In 1979, over 6,000 rail cars were produced. The following year the early 1980s recession began and many orders were cancelled and new orders plummeted; in 1982, only 25 rail cars were built. Simultaneously, new developments in rail freight transport led to new products, such as multi-platform articulated spine car sets for TOFC transportation of highway semi-trailers were built for the Itel Corporation. Also in the 1980s, the company developed \\"Twin-Stack\\" well cars for double-stack rail transport of intermodal containers in a joint venture with Greenbrier.E.M.

Acquired 1985 In the early 1990s, the company's sales and profits increased dramatically due to an increase in North American railfreight. The company went public in 1994, and in 1995 acquired TrentonWorks, another rail freight rolling stock manufacturing facility in Canada.Thomas Derdak; Tina Grant, \\"The Greenbrier Companies\\", section: Greenbrier Goes Public in 1994 In 1998, the company acquired Polish freight car manufacturer Wagony≈öwidnica SA, and formed a joint venture with Bombardier Inc. in a former-Concarril plant in Ciudad Sahag√∫n for the manufacture of rail freight vehicles, named Gunderson-Concarril S.A. In 2004, Bombardier's stake in the venture was acquired. Another Mexican plant, Gunderson-GIMSA S de L de CV, was formed in 2006 as a joint venture with Grupo Industrial Monclova. In 2007, the TrentonWorks plant in Nova Scotia, Canada closed, in part due to unfavorable exchange rates, as well as lower operating costs in Mexico. Between 2006 and 2008, the company bought several rolling stock equipment companies. In 2007, GE Rail Services agreed to a $1.2 billion contract for building over 10,000 rail cars: as a result of the general economic recession initiated by the 2000s financial crisis, GE attempted to alter the terms of the contract which represented 84 percent of Greenbrier's order book; any reduction in the order volume was expected to cause job and revenue losses in addition to those already caused by the recession. The situation led to members of the Greenbrier board being openly critical of their client GE. On 15 December 2009, GE and Greenbrier reached a modified contract agreement in which Greenbrier would manufacturer up to 6000 units for GE. As terms of the contract Greenbrier gained the right of first refusal to manufacture any GE railcar order placed up to December 2018, and a similar right to any vehicle refurbishment up to 2015. Greenbrier also obtained maintenance co-partner agreement for GE's rail rolling stock over a five-year period. The resultant contract gave Greenbrier an order book of at least 4,900 units valued at $430 million plus an option for a further 2,200 vehicles. The reduced contract still represented approximately 40 percent of the North American freight car industry backlog.Sources:  * In December 2012, Carl Icahn made an offer to purchase Greenbrier for $20 a share, representing a 5.4 percent premium to Greenbrier's stock price at that time, but his offer was rejected. On June 4, 2014, Greenbrier announced a railcar repair joint venture company with Watco Companies, called GBW Railcar Services. On August 20, 2018, Greenbrier and Watco announced the discontinuation of the jv to allow both companies to better capitalize on railcar repair demands in the North American market. Under the agreement, the repair shops and employees at each location were returned to management by their previous operators. In 2015 Greenbrier acquired a 19.5% stake in Brazilian railcar manufacturer Amsted-Maxion Hortol√¢ndia for $US 15m, with an option to acquire a further 40.5% stake by late 2017. In October 2016 the Greenbrier Companies and Astra Rail Management (Astra Rail Industries, Romania) announced they intended to merge their European activities into a joint venture \\"Greenbrier-Astra\\" - as part of the agreement Greenbrier was to pay $60million total to Astra Rail, with the joint venture becoming 75% owned by Greenbrier. In October 2018, Greenbrier and Saudi Railway Company (SAR) announced that they signed an agreement under which the parties will invest and generate investments totaling 1 billion Saudi riyals (US$270 million) in the Saudi rail industry. Through the joint venture, Greenbrier and SAR will establish a new multi-modal business centered on creating and maximizing existing and new rail routes for freight movement throughout the Kingdom and, ultimately, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The relationship between the companies began in 2015 when Greenbrier was awarded a contract with the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to manufacture nearly 1,200 tank wagons for SAR. In July 2019, Greenbrier completed the acquisition of American Railcar Industries (ARI), a transaction valued at $400 million. The acquisition will strengthen domestic core North American markets, develop a deeper talent pipeline and grow the business to a larger scale. Adjusted diluted earnings per share accretion are expected to exceed 20% during the first 12 months. Following the transaction, Greenbrier will have a larger U.S. railcar manufacturing footprint, adding ARI's two manufacturing facilities in Arkansas. It will employ more U.S. workers at cost competitive and flexible facilities, with a more efficient delivery model throughout North America, due to lower transportation costs. The combined operations are expected to bring a broader freight railcar portfolio, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings from vertical integration.

He was one of the literary stalwarts of the Jonaki Era, the age of romanticism in Assamese literature when through his essays, plays, fiction, poetry and satires, he gave a new impetus to the then stagnating Assamese literary caravan. He responded to the prevailing social environment through his satirical works to bring and sustain positive changes to the former. His literature reflected the deeper urges of the people of Assam. Confusion regarding date of birth There is confusion regarding the date of birth of Bezbaroa and also a story behind it as told by Bezbaroa himself. In the first line of the first paragraph of the first chapter of his auto-biography Mor Jiban Xuworon (‡¶Æ‡ßã‡ß∞ ‡¶ú‡ßÄ‡ß±‡¶® ‡¶∏‡ßã‡¶Å‡ß±‡ß∞‡¶£), Bezbaroa confirms outright his inability to remember his exact date of birth that his parents used to tell him. But later when he grew young and required to put his date of birth for essential records, he invented a date for the purpose viz.\\"1868 AD, November\\", but was born in 1864. He writes that he would like to offer this piece of information to anyone interested in knowing about his date of birth, although he is unsure whether that information would in any way affect the balance-sheet of anyone's life. In the next line he explicitly writes that approximately translates into > \\"I am not convinced that on hearing, knowing or composing the news of my > incarnation to destroy the \\"Annasur\\" (Food Devil) in that given year, > perhaps two or four years earlier or later for that matter, the mankind > shall be at any loss or profit or concede any damage.\\" In the very next paragraph, he went on describing in detail how and why the Bundle of Birth-Charts, kept religiously and secretly away from the kids by his parents, which contained the one, the his one he knew for certain during his childhood, was lost. Bezbaroa has however confirmed in his auto-biography that he was born in the autumn on a full-moon night, on which \\"Lakhmi Puja\\" ( A Hindu festival of worship of Goddess Lakhmi) is celebrated in India, and to mark the coincidence, he was named by his parents as \\"Lakshminath\\" ( A name for Vishnu, the Hindu God and husband of Goddess Lakhmi). This autumn-festival celebrated in the full-moon of Ashvin usually falls in the month of October in any year. As per a NASA website data, there was only one full-moon day in the month of November 1868 and that was on 30th but that was not the day of celebration of Lakshmi puja in that year. Presently, the Assam Sahitya Sabha has settled on a date ‚Äì 14 October1864, that was a full-moon night of Lakshmi Puja in India, for his date of birth. Education Bezbaroa received his early education Sibsagar Govt. High School at Sibsagar. Thereafter he studied for his F.A. from the City College and subsequently graduated with B.A. from the General Assembly's Institution in Calcutta. Then he took his M.A. and B.L. degrees from the University of Calcutta. Personal life Bezbaroa married Pragyasundari Devi, a niece of the poet Rabindranath TagoreHe presided over the All Assam students congerence at Guwahati in 1921. Honours Bezbaroa on a 1968 stamp of India Bezbaroa was honoured by a unique title on 29 December 1931 as'Roxoraj' (‡ß∞‡¶∏‡ß∞‡¶æ‡¶ú) by Asam Sahitya Sabha at its Sibsagar session. In the felicitation letter by Asam Sahitya Sabha, the word 'Sahityarathi' was used for the first time for Bezbaroa. Roxoraj meaning 'The King of Humour' in Assamese literature for his ever-popular satirical writings under the pen-name \\"Kripaabor Borbaruah\\", a pseudo-personality that he created and portrayed as the lead character in such works. He is also known in Assamese literary society as the Sahityarathi (‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ß∞‡¶•‡ßÄ) which means \\"Charioteer of Literature\\" for his expertise in all branches of literature. . He presided over the All-Assam Students' Conference at Guwahati in 1921. He presided over the 7th annual session of Assam Sahitya Sabha held at Guwahati in 1924. He died in Dibrugarh on 26 March at the age of seventy only a few months after he went back to live in Assam permanently. The Asom Sahitya Sabha annually observes this day Sahitya Divas. Pragya Sundari Devi was the second daughter of Maharshi Debendranath Tagore's third son Hemendranath Tagore (1845‚Äì 1885). Pragya Sundari was the first to write a cookbook in Bangla named 'Aamish O Niramish Aahar' in three volumes which became immensely popular. She also used to edit a magazine named 'Punya'. Pragya Sundari and Laxminath's granddaughter,Rita Devi is famous Odissi dancer. Literary career Bezbaroa started his literary career with a farce, \\"Litikai\\" serialised from the first issue of Jonaki magazine. He wrote 8 plays, 4 farces, 3 historical works, 1 act drama, 3 biographies and 2 autobiographies. He also wrote for the children. He collected and compiled folk tales of Assam (Xadhukotha) and added on his own to the basket, quite a few new tales to the benefit of nurturing parents and babysitters. Bezbaroa was the pioneer short story writer in Assam. His short stories covered the different features from the Assamese society but with humorous sentiment. Rasaraj Bezbaroa was earmarked as a patriotic playwright while he composed three historical plays, namely- Chakradhaj Singha, Joymoti Konwori and Belimaar. O Mur Apunar Dex, a patriotic song composed by him, is the state anthem of Assam. Literary works Lakshminath Bezbaroa Lakshimath Bezbaruah was residing with his parents in the house located near Mandela Chowck, Sambalpur, Odisha from 1878 to 1938. Odisha Government is planning this house to his museum.

It is the second straight-to-DVD \\"Raw Feed\\" horror film from Warner Home Video, released on March 13, 2007. The film stars Tom Cavanagh, Kathleen York, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, and Katherine Cunningham- Eves. Plot The plot centers on the protagonist George Grieves (Cavanagh), who checks into the Mt. Abaddon Hospital for a routine procedure only to find horrors await him. Awakening from what was supposedly a simple colonoscopy, Grieves is told by hospital staff that due to confusion arising from similar patient names he was mistakenly given a sympathectomy to cure sweaty palms. As the days tick by Mr. Grieves' post-operative experiences grow ever more bizarre until he finally realizes that he is caught inside a nightmare of his own creation and seems unable to escape or awaken back in the real world. He understands that something has gone wrong in his post-operative recovery which is keeping him trapped in this netherworld of manifestations of all of his worst fears but he understands neither what the problem is nor what, if anything, he can do to awaken from it. We eventually see his condition from his family's perspective and it appears hopeless. The doctors explain that there was a complication during the colonoscopy which created an air bubble in his bloodstream that eventually reached his brain and caused so much damage that he ended up in an apparently permanent vegetative state. He's been dead to the outside world for 10 months and his family is being pressured to remove all artificial means of life support. Meanwhile, back inside his own mind, George Grieves is in a desperate losing battle with his own manifested fears and decides that the only way out is to commit suicide in this dream-like state hoping that it will cause his real body to expire and free him from the interminable torment he's had to endure. He manages to leap from a 7th-floor window onto the concrete below, and the final shot is of his real-world body lying in an empty hospital room where it flatlines, closing its eyelids in physical death.

Oatley, allegedly from Stafford and aged 44, was sentenced to penal transportation for life at Hampshire Assizes on 7 March 1814. Oatley had a number of convictions, dating back to 1806, when he had stolen one ton of cheese. He was sent to Australia for stealing shirts and bedding.Hampshire Chronicle Monday 14 March 1814 p3 Life in colonial Sydney Oatley arrived in Sydney, New South Wales on 27 January 1815 on board the Marquis of Wellington.. On 25 October 1821, he was given a conditional pardon. In this record, Oatley is mentioned as a \\"native of Warwickshire\\", and a physical description is also provided; he is described as being pale, with dark brown hair, grey eyes, 5'5\\", and \\"stout\\" (with the remainder of the instrument of pardon being difficult to read). Oatley was awarded several land grants; in 1831 and on 30 October 1832, 24 December 1833, 23 January 1834, and 27 July 1835. Areas covered by these land grants include Snugborough (in the vicinity of the modern Moorefields Road, Kingsgrove), which he farmed, and Needwood Forest (now Hurstville Grove). In total, the land approximately covered is similar to that now bounded by Canterbury Road, Belmore, to the north, King George Road to the west, Kingsgrove Road to the east, and the Georges River to the south. Death James Oatley died on 9 October 1839. His death notice in the Sydney Monitor gives his age as 72 years; the Parish record of his burial gives James' age as 70 years. Oatley was buried on his property, Snugborough. Legacy Oatley and his family's legacy has been reflected via geography. In 1903, the southern Sydney suburb of Oatley was named after the family. Prior to that, the area west of the railway line was known as New Oatley's, which was a sub-district of Hurstville, and Oatley Platform; east of the railway line was known as Oatley's, which was a sub- district of Kogarah. In 1905, Frederick Street, Oatley, named after Frederick Stokes Oatley, was constructed as the main street of the new suburb. Oatley Street, Woollahra, lying between Ocean Street and Edgecliffe Street, existed in the 1850s and early 1860s. Frederick Stokes Oatley resided between Ocean Street and Oatley Street, Woollahra. Oatley Lane, Oatley Street, and Oatley Road, all of which were named after James Oatley Jnr, existed in East Sydney. Oatley Road extended into Paddington. A remnant of Oatley Road still exists in Paddington, running beside the Victoria Barracks. The original Oatley land between Moorefields Road and the railway line through Kingsgrove Station remained largely as open paddocks until it was subdivided for housing and industry in the early 1970s. A street off Kingsgrove Road was named after James Oatley. Just north of Moorefields Road are Robert Street and Eleanor Avenue. Personal life The personal life of James Oatley was well documented in the 1825 Muster of New South Wales, and in his will. Oatley married twice. In England, he married Sarah Bennett. Little is known about this marriage. James than had a de facto relationship with Mary Stokes, his housekeeper. Mary was the mother of his three sons, James Stokes Jnr, Frederick Stokes, and George (1820‚Äì1821) shown as James' children in the 1825 Muster, and each described in James' will as \\"my adopted son\\". Mary arrived in Sydney on 8 June 1815 on board the Northampton, with her son, then called James [but later renamed Robert], born during the voyage. The 1825 muster clearly indicates that Robert was Mary's child, but not James' child. Robert was described as \\"an adopted child\\" in James' will. After Mary's death, Oatley married Mary Ann Bogg in 1833.

James Stokes Oatley Jnr assumed responsibility for running the family farm after Oatley Snr's death. The farm was later sold and James became an innkeeper (also described as licensee and victualler) until he entered the NSW Parliament as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in 1868. James married Eleanor Johnson (also known as Ellen, Helena, and Emily), with whom he had eight children. After Eleanor's death, James married Margaret Curtis, with whom he had one daughter *Frederick Stokes Oatley (1819‚Äì1890) was a watchmaker and Inspector of Abattoirs. Frederick married Jane Weedon, with whom he had twelve children. James Snr gave to Frederick his watchmaking business in George Street, Sydney, and Needwood Forest.

The triangular region is demarcated by Broad Street, Elmwood Avenue, and Interstate 95.  History  Providence neighborhoods with Elmwood in red Prior to the 1850s, the region had been used primarily as farm land. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as the city began to expand south and west with the development of manufacturing and shipping interests, the area began to develop. In the 1840s through 1860s, as the city of Providence expanded from a population of 23,000 to past 50,000, development crept southwestward along Broad Street. As areas began to be densely populated, the remaining farms were subdivided. The neighborhood takes its name from one of its principal developers, Joseph J. Cooke, who in 1843 purchased a large tract of farm land and named the estate \\"Elmwood\\". He and other developers sought to build a model suburban community with wide streets and shade-giving elm trees.Providence Neighborhoods: Elmwood As public transportation improved from omnibuses (horse-drawn carriages) to horse-drawn tracked cars, and finally to electrified streetcars, development began to quicken pace. A number of manufacturers moved to Elmwood, while the area near Public St, Elmwood Ave, and Potters Ave began to develop as a middle to upper class residential neighborhood. As the automobile came to increase in popularity, businesses in the form of car dealerships, garages, and service stations would proliferate along Elmwood Avenue. As the trolley service was bustituted, Elmwood Ave was widened significantly and the elm trees Cooke planted had to be removed. These changes in streetscape changed the character of the neighborhood. When the 1950s came, Interstate 95 was constructed, and many single-family homes were converted into apartments. Combined with the aging housing stock and traffic congestion, the neighborhood became less appealing to the middle-class, who left in large numbers during this time. By the early and mid 1970s, spot demolition on dilapidated houses became common and Elmwood fell into disrepair. In more recent years, there have been many efforts to restore many older mansions and revitalize the neighborhood. In 1980, two large, predominantly residential areas of Elmwood were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Elmwood Historic District, with emphasis on their nineteenth century revival and Victorian houses. Additionally, the City of ProvidenceProvidence Historic District Commission, Local Historic District Info has established local (municipal level) historic districts as North ElmwoodNorth Elmwood Historic District Map and South Elmwood,South Elmwood Historic District Map which protect historic properties and the neighborhood's historic identity by restricting exterior modifications of architectural items such as windows, porches, slate roofs, etc. Restoration efforts in Elmwood were featured on 'Season 11 of Bob Vilia's Home Again' when he helps 11 neighbors with various projects over the course of 13 episodes highlighting the historic nature of homes in the neighborhood.

Notes * The modern day Woodbury High School was established in 1902 and is usually recognized as that year. However, the precursor schools that evolved into WHS were actually established in 1791. * Blue is not an official color; only white and gold are the official colors of Woodbury High School. The color blue is often partnered with gold for the school's athletic teams' uniforms, thus it is often confused to be blue and gold instead of white and gold. * Due to small enrollment and the inability to field full teams themselves, the cross country, swimming, and wrestling teams have combined with Gateway Regional High School to form a Woodbury/Gateway athletic partnership. * To put the championships into perspective, in the early 1950s there were far fewer sports to participate in at the high school level, and Title IX would not occur for 20 more years. * The field hockey team was tied with two other schools as three-way co-champions. * Decatur and Lawrence attended the Woodbury Academy, which was built in the 18th century and is the precursor to the present day school.

In Europe=Cold iron \\"Cold iron\\" is historically believed to repel, contain, or harm ghosts, fairies, witches, and other malevolent supernatural creatures. This belief continued into later superstitions in a number of forms: * Nailing an iron horseshoe to a door was said to repel evil spirits or later, to bring good luck. * Surrounding a cemetery with an iron fence was thought to contain the souls of the dead. * Burying an iron knife under the entrance to one's home was alleged to keep witches from entering. \\"Cold Iron\\" is a substitute name used for various animals and incidences considered unlucky by Irish fishermen. A similar phenomenon has been found with Scottish Fishermen. Horseshoes talisman in some cultures. Horseshoes are considered a good luck charm in many cultures, including those of England, Denmark,Thorpe, Benjamin (1851). Northern Mythology: Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands. E. Lumley. Lithuania, and Estonia, and its shape, fabrication, placement and manner of sourcing are all important. A common tradition is that if a horseshoe is hung on a door with the two ends pointing up (as shown here) then good luck will occur. However, if the two ends point downwards then bad luck will occur. Traditions do differ on this point, though. In some cultures, the horseshoe is hung points down (so the luck pours onto you); in others, it is hung points up (so the luck does not fall out); still in others it does not matter so long as the horseshoe has been used (not new), was found (not purchased), and can be touched. In all traditions, luck is contained in the shoe and can pour out through the ends. In some traditions, any good or bad luck achieved will only occur to the owner of the horseshoe, not the person who hangs it up. Therefore, if the horseshoe was stolen, borrowed or even just found then the owner, not the person who found or stole the horseshoe will get any good or bad luck. Other traditions require that the horseshoe be found to be effective. Illustration by George Cruikshank for The True Legend of St. Dunstan and the Devil One reputed origin of the tradition of lucky horseshoes is the story of Saint Dunstan and the Devil. Dunstan, who would become the Archbishop of Canterbury in AD 959, was a blacksmith by trade. The story relates that he once nailed a horseshoe to the Devil's hoof when he was asked to reshoe the Devil's horse. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after the Devil promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is hung over the door. Another theory concerning the placing of horseshoes above doorways is to ward off faeries; the theory being that supernatural beings are repelled by iron and as horseshoes were an easily available source of iron, they could be nailed above a door to prevent any unwanted, otherworldly guests. Meteoric iron in Tibet Thogcha ()Bellezza, John Vincent (March, 1999). Thogchags: The Ancient Amulets of Tibet. Source: (accessed: Wednesday April 14, 2010) means 'sky- iron' in Tibetan. Meteoric iron was highly prized throughout the Himalayas where it was included in sophisticated polymetallic alloys for ritual implements such as the singing bowl (Jansen, 1992) and phurba (M√ºller-Ebeling, et al., 2002). Beer (1999: p. 234) holds that:  In fiction  Cold iron is a poetic term for iron. Francis Grose's 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue defines cold iron as \\"A sword, or any other weapon for cutting or stabbing.\\" This usage often appears as \\"cold steel\\" in modern parlance. Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"Cold Iron\\", found in his 1910 collection of stories Rewards and Fairies, used the term poetically to mean \\"weapon\\". In his novel Redgauntlet, the Scottish author Sir Walter Scott wrote, \\"Your wife's a witch, man; you should nail a horse-shoe on your chamber-door.\\" In modern fantasy, cold iron may refer to a special type of metal, such as meteoric iron or unworked metal. Weapons and implements made from cold iron are often granted special efficacy against creatures such as fairies and spirits. In the Disney film Maleficent, the title character reveals early on that iron is lethal to fairies, and that the metal burns them on contact.

In 1891 he and his wife, noted artist Agnes Augusta Bartlett Brown, moved to New York City, where he died on January 18, 1902. Family and education Although Massachusetts town vital records and many sources identify West Newbury, Massachusetts, as the place of John Appleton Brown's birth on July 12, 1844, some say he was born in the larger neighboring city of Newburyport, where Brown attended high school. He was the second of two sons of George Frederick Handel Brown (a combmaker) and Asenath L. Page. His parents supported Appleton Brown's artistic talent throughout his childhood; he spent summer school vacations painting landscapes of his native West Newbury and the surrounding area. Initially he spent a year studying with New England landscape painter Alfred Thompson Bricher. After a year working in a Boston studio shared with fellow-novice Benjamin Curtis Porter, in 1866 Brown traveled to France, where in 1867-68 he studied under landscape artist Emile Lambinet, himself a prot√©g√© of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. Career By the 1870s, Brown was a successful and well-known Boston painter. His work was exhibited with his friends and mentors William Morris Hunt and Joseph Foxcroft Cole, at shows of the Boston Art Club, and at prominent galleries. In the fall of 1874, he and his wife Agnes went to France to study and paint. He displayed and sold works in the Paris Salon of 1875, whose jurors included established Barbizon school painters. The Browns typically maintained a winter studio in Boston and had a summer house in West Newbury, whose surrounds comprised the rural New England landscapes which were frequent subjects of his art. Starting in 1879, both Browns had annual exhibitions at Boston's Doll and Richards gallery. At this time Brown's paintings and drawings were used as book illustrations. According to Dartmouth College curator and art writer Barbara J. MacAdam, in the 1880s Brown adopted a brighter palette and \\"turned more frequently to images of fruit trees in full flower, lending him the sobriquet of 'Appleblossom Brown.'\\" At the invitation of Francis Davis Millet, in 1886 the Browns joined an artists' colony in England, where Americans including John Singer Sargent and Edwin Austin Abbey were working. His paintings of the English countryside, much like in New England, were well received in Boston. Later in the 1880s the Browns summered not only in West Newbury, but also at Celia Thaxter's salon on Appledore Island among the Isles of Shoals off the coast of southern Maine. There he became a close friend of Childe Hassam and painted seascapes, including the dramatic and powerful \\"Storm at the Isles of Shoals.\\" In the 1890s, Brown's success had expanded well beyond Boston. When he participated in an art show in Chicago, a reviewer described Brown's picture \\"In the Month of May\\" as \\"a brilliant, joyous study of apple-blossoms and sunny greens.\\" In 1891, the Browns moved from Boston to New York City, which offered a more vibrant arts scene. In 1893 Brown received a medal at the World's Columbian Exposition. Critics‚Äô appraisal Particularly with respect to the New England spring and summer landscapes for which he was best known and most appreciated, commenters described Brown's work as tender and delicate in its depiction of nature. His pictures were described as evocative of‚Äîbut not imitative of‚ÄîCorot. A rare negative review appeared in the March, 1872 issue of the Atlantic Monthly. This article focused on an early Brown work \\"Grindelwald Valley,\\" whose subject of majestic soaring mountains in the Swiss Alps was, in the reviewer's opinion, an audacious one for Brown. In this critic's view, Brown's treatment of such a grand subject as mere sketch had the ‚Äúunpardonable defect of being thinly painted.‚Äù A little over five years later, another Atlantic Monthly review concluded that in the autumn landscape \\"On the Artichoke, West Newbury,\\" Brown's treatment of clouds reflected in water was appropriately not belabored in its detail: \\"Though done with one sweep of the brush, it would be hard to conceive how any subsequent caressing or tinkering could add an iota to their tender and evanescent loveliness.\\" Poetry as inspiration for, as reflected in, as inspired by, and as illustrated with Appleton Brown's work is another common theme among critics and writers. \\"J. Appleton Brown was a poet-painter. Not only did he create evocative paintings and pastels that celebrated the lyrical moods of nature but he also loved to read verse, illustrated volumes of poetry, had poet friends, and created art that inspired verse.\\" In 1879 Brown collaborated with Lucy Larcom, illustrating her book Landscape in American Poetry, which viewed the same New England landscape Brown painted through the words of noteworthy poets, such as John Greenleaf Whittier, from the same region. Just as poetry inspired Appleton Brown's pictures, so too did his art inspire poetry. Will Amos Reed's book of verse Through Broken Reeds contains the poem \\"On Seeing a Picture by J. Appleton Brown.\\" It begins, \\"How deep in nature‚Äôs lore must artists dip / To form such lights and shadows with a brush‚Äôs tip!\\" Personal life and death In June 1874, Brown married Newburyport native Agnes Augusta Bartlett. She was a noted artist in her own right, painting in oil in a style not unlike her husband's. Her subjects included landscapes, flowers, and later cats. By all accounts, Brown was charming, a good friend, and \\"retiring and modest\\" in nature. He was also said to be an excellent art teacher. At the same time, Brown's work was exhibited at fashionable shows that displayed not only art but also fashionable art viewers. Brown maintained \\"social relations with our best families,\\" serving, for instance, as an officer in Boston's St. Botolph Club with such luminaries as Henry Cabot Lodge and Francis Parkman. Brown was also a member of the Society of American Artists, and an associate of the National Academy of Design. Brown died at age 57, on January 18, 1902. His friends and fellow artists Alfred Q. Collins and Frank Shapleigh accompanied his body to Newburyport for burial. In March 1902, the Century Club mounted a memorial exhibition of his work. His works are now housed in such institutions as the Harvard University art museums, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Francis Quadrangle is the historical center of the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Known as The Quad it is the oldest part of Red Campus and adjacent to Downtown Columbia at the south end of the Avenue of the Columns. At its center are six Ionic columns, all that remains of the original university building Academic Hall. Twelve buildings front the modern quadrangle including the domed main administration building Jesse Hall, the tallest building in Columbia. The Quad was designed and constructed by architect Morris Frederick Bell and his assistant William Lincoln Garver. It is named after Missouri governor David R. Francis. Eighteen structures, including the entire quad and most of Red Campus are listed as the Francis Quadrangle National Historic District. An obelisk, the original tombstone of Thomas Jefferson stands in front of the Chancellor's Residence. It was gifted to the University by Jefferson's descendants in recognition of Missouri's ties to Virginia. In front of Jesse Hall stand markers honoring university president Richard Henry Jesse and Missouri governor David R. Francis. Nearby is another obelisk in memory of Missouri's first U.S. senator David Barton, The Missouri School of Journalism is located at the northeast corner of The Quad, comprising Walter Williams Hall, Neff Hall, Gannet Hall, along with the Reynolds Journalism Institute. To the west, Switzler Hall is the oldest academic building on campus, though the Residence on the Quad, home of the chancellor, is the oldest building overall. The University of Missouri College of Engineering completes the west side. Pickard Hall is currently closed due to radiation contamination from turn of the century experiments. Swallow Hall was recently renovated and houses the Departments of Anthropology, Visual Studies and Ancient Mediterranean Studies. History At the genesis of the University of Missouri the only building among a great forest campus was Academic Hall. Constructed by architect Stephen Hills from 1840 to 1843 out of Red Brick and limestone quarried from the bluff of Hinkson Creek, this was the only academic building of the university for many years. In 1843 a mansion was built next door for the President of the University of Missouri. During the American Civil War, Union troops occupied Academic Hall and burned the ancient forest and parts of the library for firewood. Academic Hall was damaged and the president mansion was burned in 1865. After the war, the University sued the federal government for damages, eventually winning and building the Memorial Gateway on the Avenue of the Columns with the money. A new President's Mansion was built in 1867 and still stands today. The need for expansion after the war necessitated the construction of Scientific Hall, now Switzler Hall in 1872. The burning of Academic Hall on a cold January night in 1892 ushered in a time of great change for the University. There was much support in the Missouri Legislature to move the University to Sedalia. The Governor of Missouri, David R. Francis, sent a telegram to the students of the University assuring them that he would fight to keep the campus in Columbia. He later traveled to Columbia to address the citizens, faculty, and students. After calling for a special session of the Missouri Legislature he was able to appropriate $250,000 for the rebuilding. The University of Missouri was rebuilt in a quad around the columns, with \\"New Academic Hall\\" later renamed Jesse Hall on the south, and the Avenue of the Columns on the North. Academic Hall fire On October 23, 2010 the quad was featured as the location of an ESPN's College GameDay. An ESPN record of over 18,000 fans showed up.http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/19822/record-turnout-for-college- gameday Buildings=Geology Building The Geology Building The Geology Building is the newest stand-alone building on The Quad. Hill Hall Hill Hall was built in 1950 and named after former President of The University Albert Ross Hill. Jesse Hall Jesse Hall behind the Columns Jesse Hall was constructed in 1892 as the \\"New Academic Hall\\". It was later renamed after MU president Richard Henry Jesse. The dome rises nine stories above the quad, and is one of the most recognized symbols of MU. It was designed by architect Morris Frederick Bell, and serves as the administrative center for the University of Missouri‚ÄìColumbia. Lafferre Hall The Engineering Building was built in 1892 and lies on the west side of the quad. After a significant donation, the building is now called Lafferre Hall. Pickard Hall Pickard Hall from the Quad Pickard Hall was built in 1892 and contained the MU Art and Archaeology Museum until 2013, when it was closed due to latent radiation from experiments dating 1910-1930. It was named after professor of archaeology and art history John Pickard. Residence on the Quad The Residence on The Quad was built in 1867 and stands on the East side of the quad. It is the oldest building left standing on campus. Thomas Jefferson's original tombstone stands between this building and The Columns. The Residence is intended to be the official home of the University's chancellor. Sociology The original Sociology building has a four-story tower The Sociology building was built in 1892 and stands near the northeast corner of the quad. The building has been renovated and turned into the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute. Swallow Hall Swallow Hall was built in 1893 and stands on the southeast corner. It is named after George Clinton Swallow, Missouri's first state geologist. Today the building holds the Museum of Anthropology. Switzler Hall Switzler Hall was constructed in 1871 as the \\"Scientific Building\\". It is the oldest academic building left standing on campus. Switzler Hall is named after curator William Franklin Switzler. One of the notable attractions of Switzler Hall is the bell tower. The bell was given to the University by Major James S. Rollins and is inscribed with the words \\"Nunc occasion est et tempus,\\" which translated is, \\"Now is the occasion and the time.\\" The bell rang each hour classes were in session until 1936. Monuments=The Columns The Columns that once supported Academic Hall designed by Stephen Hills now stand in the middle of the quad. The Columns are the only remaining part of Academic Hall after it burned on January 9, 1892. In August 1893 the Board of Curators voted to remove the Columns because they thought that they were unsafe and ugly. The Columns were inspected and found that the foundations were sound. Local support for keeping the Columns changed the Board's mind and the vote was reversed in December 1893. Today, The Columns are the second-most photographed landmarks in the state of Missouri, next to the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Thomas Jefferson's tombstone Thomas Jefferson's original tombstone stands on the east side of the quad. Jefferson's original tombstone was given to Mizzou by his heirs in July 1883 due to Mizzou being the first University founded within Thomas Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase. The plaque on the gravestone reads \\"This original marker, placed at the grave of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, Virginia in 1826, constructed from his own design, was presented July 4, 1883, by the Jefferson heirs to the University of Missouri. First state university to be founded in the Louisiana Territory purchased from France during President Jefferson's administration. The obelisk, dedicated on this campus at commencement June 4, 1885, commemorates Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, whose faith in the future of western America and whose confidence in the people has shaped our national ideals; commemorates the author of the Declaration of Independence and of the Virginia statute for religious freedom, founder of the University of Virginia, fosterer of public education in the United States.\\" And under these words it reads (the original epitaph) \\"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson Author of the Declaration of American Independence of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom and FATHER of the University of Virginia\\" Francis Marker As tribute to former governor of Missouri, David R. Francis, a statue of stands just northeast of the entrance to Jesse Hall. It is a tradition that before an exam a student will rub his nose to receive an A on the exam. Due to the tradition's popularity the statue's nose has been replaced three times since its dedication.

A Mega-CD port of Cobra Command developed by Wolf Team was released in 1992. Plot Terrorists are threatening the free world and have amassed a diabolical force. Only the brave pilot of Cobra Command can vanquish the terrorist threat and save the free world from total destruction. The player assumes the role as pilot of the LX-3 Super Cobra helicopter (fictional, but similar to the Bell AH-1 SuperCobra). The missions go across the New York City streets, the Statue of Liberty, the Atlantic Ocean, Italy, the Grand Canyon and the enemy's headquarters on Easter Island. Gameplay The original arcade version is an interactive movie and shooter game, where the player watches scenes as the helicopter flies by the conflict zone. The game screen is represented by the helicopter's cockpit, and the player controls a crosshair that can be moved to aim at the enemy forces. The game features a joystick and two buttons: one Machine Gun and one Missile. The game can be played with 1 or 2 players. In certain moments, the voice of the pilot's commanding officer helps the player out with completing each mission by firing at enemy forces and dodging both enemy fire and natural surroundings, by pressing the joystick or directional pad in the correct direction and at the right time. If the pilot makes a mistake, the anime sequence shows the Cobra helicopter blown up and the player loses a life. If all lives are lost, the \\"Game Over\\" screen shows the Cobra in smoldering ruins and its pilot is presumably dead from the crash. Development Kunio-kun and Double Dragon series creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto designed an entirely new game, Cobra Command, using Data East's Bega's Battle hardware. Cobra Command was developed by Data East in co-operation with Toei Animation. It was first published in Japan in 1984 as Thunder Storm, then released later the same year in North America as Cobra Command. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Cobra Command on their May 15, 1984 issue as being the most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Reviewing the Sega CD version in Wizard magazine, Glenn Rubenstein praised the high number of levels and unique interface. He gave the game a B-.

History The term power dressing relates to a fashion style typical of the business and politics environment of the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the expression \\"power dressing\\" is not more commonly used, but the style is still popular. Power dressing arose in the United States in the second half of the 1970s. Power dressing could be analyzed through visual sociology, which studies how fashion operates in the relationship between social systems and the negotiation of power.\\"Fashioning Power ‚Äì Visual self-presentation in Social Life\\", Anna Akbari, Submitted to The New School for Social Research in May 2008 - Dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. (Dissertation Committee: Dr. Jeffrey Goldfarb, Dr. Elzbieta Matynia, Dr. Jacho Kang, Dr. Marshall Blonsky) The concept of power dressing was brought to popularity by John T. Molloy's manuals Dress for success (1975) and Women: dress for success (1980), which suggest a gender specific professional dress code. Molloy's manuals addressed a new kind of female workers entering in a typical masculine environment recommending them a \\"uniform\\" that would have helped them to acquire authority, respect and power at work.Buy this Book: Studies in Advertising and Consumption\\", Mica Nava, Andrew Blake, Iain MacRury, Barry Richards ‚Äì Routledge, 1997 Features Initially power dressing consisted in a conservative style recalling directly the male wardrobe including tailored suits, jackets with padded shoulders, roll-neck sweaters and knee length skirts. With the power dressing uniform, the female body was divided in two parts: The upper part covered by a jacket to de-emphasize breasts, the bottom covered with a skirt that was a reminder of femininity.\\"The Fashioned body ‚Äì Fashion, Dress and Modern Social Theory\\", Joanne Entwistle, Polity Press, 2000 These outfits were usually matched with feminine accessories, discreet pieces of jewelry like pearls, diamonds, gold necklaces, earrings, scarves and ruffs. Elaborate patterns such as floral prints were usually substituted by polka, pinstripes and hound-tooth ones. As far as colors were concerned, more sober ones such as blue, black, navy and grey were commonly preferred to feminine ones like salmon pink and red. Origins The origins of power dressing can be found in the Chanel suit of the 1920s. The Chanel suit was composed by a tight skirt and by a wool, collarless button-up jacket, usually with braid trim, metallic buttons and fitted sleeves.http://www.gurjotnewyork.com/blog/the-history-of-the-suit-coco-chanel- and-the-first-womens-suit/ This suit represented a turning point in the way women dressed. In fact, it was the very first professional suit specifically thought for women, which enabled them to look modern and feminine while feeling comfortable. It included traditionally masculine elements which gave women a very authoritative appearance, but at the same time it left space for a refined and sophisticated look.\\"Chanel\\" by Harold Koda, Andrew Bolton, Olivier Saillard, Rhonda Garelick (Contribution by), Karl Lagerfeld (Contributor), Caroline Rennolds Milbank (Contributor), Nancy J. Troy (Contributor) - Published June 11th 2005 by Metropolitan Museum of Art The most important innovation of the Chanel suit was that it was deliberately designed to adapt to the changing lifestyle of women that, during and after the World War I, were slowly entering previously all-men environments. This suit encouraged women to try to reach their professional goals giving them comfort and mobility to fit with their independent and active lifestyles. According to the costume historian Harold Koda\\"Chanel\\" by Harold Koda, Andrew Bolton, Olivier Saillard, Rhonda Garelick (Contribution by), Karl Lagerfeld (Contributor), Caroline Rennolds Milbank (Contributor), Nancy J. Troy (Contributor) - Published June 11th 2005 by Metropolitan Museum of Art the Chanel suit allowed women of the time to de-sex their feminine look and to have a more masculine appearance in order to be accepted as equals in the professional sphere. Evolution It was only when enough women were clearly established as authoritative in the work environment, that it was possible to renovate the women suit: no more feminized imitations of men's professional garments but suit different in fabric, cut, color and ornament, helping women to show both their authority and their femininity. Wearing a suit did not represent an effort to camouflage with men but an effort to stand out and define a clear visual presence.\\"Fashioning Power ‚Äì Visual self-presentation in Social Life\\", Anna Akbari, Submitted to The New School for Social Research in May 2008 - Dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. (Dissertation Committee: Dr. Jeffrey Goldfarb, Dr. Elzbieta Matynia, Dr. Jacho Kang, Dr. Marshall Blonsky) In fact, it was only in the second half of the 1980s that more feminine garments were introduced in the \\"power uniform\\". For instance blouse, usually seen as romantic, were now worn with intricate stock or cravat effect neck wrappings, made up in silk or polyester satin foulard. Jersey knit bodies, buttoned under the crotch, were used to have an elegant silhouette. Social meaning Power dressing discourse was significant in building a new type of working woman appearing in the society at the time. The notion of career woman stepped into contemporary society as women reached high powered job positions, which previously were intended to men. With the help of an empowering self-presentation such as power suits, women were trying to break through the glass ceiling. The development of power dressing was pivotal in bringing to public visibility women in executive or business position. It served as a way to construct their image and to make them recognizable at public society's eyes. Women saw this new clothing style as way to detach from the classical feminine meaning of fashion, mainly associated with aesthetics and frivolity. Power dressing locates power at body level giving a message about women and their profession, enclosing at the same time something about self-esteem and confidence.\\"Buy this Book: Studies in Advertising and Consumption\\", Mica Nava, Andrew Blake, Iain MacRury, Barry Richards ‚Äì Routledge, 1997 Sexuality One of the main purposes of power dressing was to reduce the female body's sexuality in order to gain authority in the workplace. According to Entwistle,\\"The Fashioned body ‚Äì Fashion, Dress and Modern Social Theory\\", Joanne Entwistle, Polity Press, 2000 in western culture female dress is considered to be more sexual than male dress. The feminine body has historically been associated with nature, nurturing, and reproduction, something that can be problematic in most workplaces, where manifesting such sexuality is considered inappropriate. According to some sociologists and psychologists, the primary function by which most women choose clothes and accessories is to look sexually appealing so that they may attract a partner. Feminists and even Freud have spoken out against this theory, since it has been well observed that both men and women take pleasure in being looked at by others, as well as take pleasure in looking at others, in a sexual context; however, it is only the female body which remains overly sexualized culturally.\\"The Fashioned body ‚Äì Fashion, Dress and Modern Social Theory\\", Joanne Entwistle, Polity Press, 2000 Power dressing thus attempts to counterbalance a woman's natural femininity and inherent sexuality, with the goal of preventing the sexual misinterpretation through her clothes that might otherwise allow.\\"The Fashioned body ‚Äì Fashion, Dress and Modern Social Theory\\", Joanne Entwistle, Polity Press, 2000 In the media=Icons Margaret Thatcher wearing a typical power dressing outfit Power dressing, as a new fashion phenomenon, has its symbols in public figures such as Margaret Thatcher, Princess Diana, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and many morehttp://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/dressing-the-iron-lady Margaret Thatcher above all was one of the first to incorporate the spirit of power suits. Her personal style was, according to Vogue, reinvented following Molloy's suggestions in order to make her appearance appropriate for the role of Prime Minister. Margaret Thatcher's style set the rules on how female politicians should dress, which is a conservative, powerful but simultaneously feminine way.http://fashionista.com/2013/04/margaret-thatcher-set-the-bar-for-power- dressing Her typical power suits consisted in a skirt suit with wide shoulder, a pussy-bow blouse and the Asprey handbag, which, thanks to her, became famous. Her signature style was to be expressed in the very famous pearl necklace.http://fashionista.com/2013/04/margaret-thatcher-set-the-bar-for- power-dressing She was able to pave the way for all those career-motivated women who were trying to succeed in a male dominated world and like her, they could find support in clothes and accessories to communicate authority and power. Hillary Clinton is a contemporary icon of power dressing: with her pantsuits she is a follower of the Thatcher style.http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/trends/2014-15-autumn-winter/power- dressing Television shows Main references to power dressing in popular culture are to be found in 1980's soap operas such as Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and Dynasty (1981‚Äì89). In these TV series typical elements of power dressing, such as padded shoulders and costume jewelry, are easily recognizable. In the Dallas soap opera, together with the typical features of power dressing more bright colors were to be seen. This TV show contributed to the return of strong colors, like fuchsia pinks, sea greens, purples, royal blue and red in women's wardrobe. Also women's fashion and business shoes were revisited during that period, changing the pointed toes and spiked heels, popular in the 1950s and early 1960s, with some fashion shoes covered with white satin or canvas and dyed to the customer's favorite color.http://1980sfashion.weebly.com/power-dressing.html Films Working Girl: In this movie power dressing is embodied in the figures of Katherine, the superboss, and Tess, the secretary. Katherine symbolizes a model of business elegance in mid-grey collarless silk jacket with padded shoulders. Her style shows important features of power dressing, but she also wears vivid red dresses, symbol of power and respect. Tess is stylistically the opposite. She adapts power dressing to her personal style making it more feminine. For instance during a business cocktail meeting, Tess wears a long black sparkly dress and a dark brown fur coat, attracting people's attention. Tess is \\"the first woman [‚Ä¶] that dresses like a woman, not like a woman would think a man would dress if he was a woman\\".http://clothesonfilm.com/working-girl-the- culture-of-power-dressing/33184/ On the contrary, the other secretaries in the movie have a different style. They appear as young and energetic girls and their clothes are the example of some quite bad taste outfits, including leopard skin print jackets, black stripe tights and copious baggy leather outerwear, often worn with gaudy hoop earrings or all gold accessories. The Iron Lady: The movie tells the story of the British politician and icon of power dressing Margaret Thatcher. Starting from her youth and going through all her life, it shows her transformation to become the first British female prime minister.http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/dressing-the-iron-lady See also *Shoulder pads (fashion) *1980s in fashion ReferencesBibliography * Nava, Blake, MacRury, Richards (1996) Buy this Book: Studies in Advertising and Consumption Routledge * Akbari (2008) Fashioning Power ‚Äì Visual self-presentation in Social Life, The New School for Social Research.

History The industrial conciliation system, modelled on New Zealand's Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894, was created in Western Australia in 1900, before the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia the following year., later replaced by the It provided for the division of the Colony (later the State) into Industrial Districts1900 Act, s. 26 (each with its own Board of Conciliation)1900 Act, s. 31, the decisions of which were subject to appeal to a Court of Arbitration.1900 Act, s. 53 The first Board of Conciliation did not commence operation until 11 July 1901, and the Court of Arbitration did not first sit until 2 April 1902. The Court of Arbitration became the Western Australia Industrial Commission in 1963, and later became the Western Australia Industrial Relations Commission in 1979. The scope of its jurisdiction was significantly restricted in 2006 when the Commonwealth's WorkChoices legislation came into effect, later revised by the Fair Work Act 2009. Of all the States, WA was the only one not to exercise its referral power to delegate further jurisdiction to the Fair Work Commission. Jurisdiction The commission has jurisdiction to hear applications for industrial awards in respect of employees and to vary those awards. It also considers applications to register Industrial Agreements between employers and employees. Where there is an industrial dispute, it will consider applications for compulsory Conferences to settle those disputes. The commission can also consider applications by employers claiming unfair dismissal or that their contractual rights haven‚Äôt been fulfilled. Composition The commission consists of a chief commissioner; a senior commissioner; and other commissioners as required. Each is appointed by the Governor of Western Australia. Prior to 2019 a commissioned role of President heard appeals made disputing any tribunal orders\\\\decisions. The bulk of the work is carried out in the commission by commissioners.

Their compilation was ordered by Louis XVI, who had convened the Estates-General of 1789 to manage the revolutionary situation, to give each of the Estates ‚Äì the First Estate (the clergy), the Second Estate (the nobility) and the Third Estate, which consisted of everyone else, including the urban working class, the rural peasantry, and middle class and professional people, who were the only ones in the group likely to have their voices heard ‚Äì the chance to express their hopes and grievances directly to the King. They were explicitly discussed at a special meeting of the Estates-General held on 5 May 1789. Many of these lists have survived and provide considerable information about the state of the country on the eve of the revolution. The documents recorded criticisms of government waste, indirect taxes, church taxes and corruption, and the hunting rights of the aristocracy.Kagan, Donald \\"The Western Heritage- Seventh Edition\\" (Pg 631), 2001 While the cahiers conveyed the grievances of common people, they were not meant to directly challenge the Ancien R√©gime. They were instead suggestions of reforms.\\"Cahiers De Dol√©ances.\\" The French Revolution: A Document Collection. Ed. Laura Mason and Tracey Rizzo. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. 54-58. Print. Still, the writing of the cahiers forced the people of France to think about the problems that France faced, and how they wanted them fixed. The political discussions that raged throughout France were a direct challenge to the current system, as they gave the people a voice, and subsequently the cahiers were used to guide the elected representatives in what to discuss at the Estates General. In essence, they added greatly to a revolutionary air of expectation of the Estates General. Cahiers of the First Estate The Cahiers of the First Estate reflected the interests of the parish clergy. They called for an end to bishops holding more than one diocese, and demanded those who were not noble be able to become bishops. In return they were prepared to give up the financial privileges of the Church. They were not, however, prepared to give up the dominant position that the Church held over the other two Estates. They did not intend to allow Protestants to practice religion, and under the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV, wanted to keep Roman Catholicism the only official religion in France. Cahiers of the Second Estate Among the three Estates, the Second Estate's cahiers were possibly the most surprising. Many of them proved to be quite liberal in their opinions, 89% voting that they were willing to give up their financial privileges. Although they had, until then, opposed the idea of commoners entering their ranks (as shown by the Segur Ordinance), they finally accepted the fact that merit, as much as hereditary status, should qualify men to hold certain offices (including Military, Administrative and Venal Offices). They also attacked the government for being out of date and the injustice of the Ancien R√©gime. Cahiers of the Third Estate Many of the cahiers of the Third Estate were composed using models sent from Paris, and it is probable that cahiers from poorer villages were constrained in expressing their grievances.\\"Cahiers De Dol√©ances.\\" The French Revolution: A Document Collection. Ed. Laura Mason and Tracey Rizzo. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. 54. Print. The cahiers were also highly variable in tone depending on where they came from, meaning that while they are often summarized as raising more sweeping and general complaints about French society at the time, many of the grievances shared were highly specific, such as Parish of St. Germain d'Airan asking \\"That dovecotes be destroyed...and that it be ordered that those remaining shall be closed in such a way that pigeons may not leave during the times of planting and harvest.\\"\\"Cahiers De Dol√©ances.\\" The French Revolution: A Document Collection. Ed. Laura Mason and Tracey Rizzo. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. 56. Print. The cahiers of the Third Estate spoke out mainly against the financial privileges held by the two other Estates. They were both exempt from most taxes such as the church tithe and the taille (the main direct tax). They also wanted to have a fair voting system in the Estates-General. At the moment, they would be outvoted by the other two orders, who would combine their votes on any issue that suited them. They had double representation (600, rather than 300 members representing them), but each estate had a single vote, and thus having double the representative would only be effective if they were voting by head, and not by order. Usage during 2018 yellow vests movement In December 2018 and January 2019, Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Fifth Republic, asked for a compilation of Cahiers de dol√©ances from across the country, which was completed in mid-January. Macron responded to the large number of petitions by calling for self-organized town halls, which took place over the period of January to March.

It has been claimed that \\"Arguably, no single person or firm had done more to transform and, for a time, homogenize Australian dress standards, particularly among men, than Fletcher Jones and his staff.\\"Jones, Sir David Fletcher (1895‚Äì1977) Biographical Entry ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Biography Fletcher Jones was born in Bendigo, Victoria, the son of a Cornish miner.London Cornish Association Newsletter, Spring 2010 In his childhood he had a stammer, but he practised reading aloud to manage this.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jones-sir-david-fletcher-10638 He left school at age 12. He served with Australian forces in France in World War I where he suffered shell shock after being buried alive for several hours. On his return his stammer had returned, but he was determined to manage it so he commenced a door-to-door sales business in Melbourne. He then decided to become a hawker in the western Victorian region. He purchased a menswear store in Warrnambool in 1924. His business expanded, and in 1941 he decided to form a new wholesale business making nothing but high-quality ready-made trousers. His first store Fletcher Jones Trousers Pty Ltd was located in Melbourne. In 1946 Fletcher Jones moved to making all trousers from personal fittings, and to deal direct to the public. In 1948 he constructed a clothing factory on the site of a rubbish dump near Warrnambool, which had once been a quarry. The site was extensively renewed with gardens, and became a much-visited tourist site. In the late 1940s he began to turn his business into a co-operative, named Fletcher Jones & Staff Pty Ltd. He structured his business so that all the employees owned shares in the company. Initially the Jones family had a two-thirds interest and the staff one-third, but the balance gradually swung so that by the 1970s the staff held over 50 per cent of the shares. From the mid-1950s, the business also made women's attire. Fletcher Jones & Staff was awarded a contract to outfit the Australian women's team for the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. At its peak, the company had over 2,700 employees and 55 stores in six states and the ACT. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Order of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1959,It's an Honour: OBE and was made a knight bachelor in 1974It's an Honour: Knight bachelor for services to decentralisation and the community. Being located in a major wool producing area, Fletcher Jones concentrated for many years on using the best local wool in its garments, and by the 1960s, was the largest Australian user of fine merino wool.http://www.fjstories.org.au/first-award-world Although he had always expressed Labor sympathies in word and deed, he publicly renounced his political allegiances when the Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and his wife Margaret made it known they were agnostics.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jones-sir-david-fletcher-10638 His first wife died in 1970, and he remarried in 1971. He published his autobiography Not By Myself in 1976. Sir Fletcher Jones died in Warrnambool in 1977, and was buried there. He was survived by his second wife, and by the daughter and two sons of his first marriage. His company was sold in 1998.

In addition to competing in tournaments, he wrote a book Chess Problems: Either to Play and Mate published in 1873. Early life Thompson was born into slavery in Frederick, Maryland, as were his parents. After emancipation, in 1868, he worked as a house servant in Carroll County, Maryland, but returned to Frederick in 1870. Career In April 1872, Thompson witnessed the game for the first time, in a match between John K. Hanshew and another man. Hanshew, who was the publisher of The Maryland Chess Review, gave Thompson a chessboard and some chess problems to solve. Thompson showed an immediate ability to learn the game and master its rules. Thompson's fame grew and he competed in a number of tournaments. He gained lasting fame for his book of endgame positions: Chess Problems: Either to Play and Mate (1873). It was published by Orestes Brownson Jr., the editor of the Dubuque Chess Journal, for whom Thompson also worked as a servant. Thompson faded into obscurity soon after gaining prominence with his book, and there is some uncertainty about the remainder of his life. The Dubuque Chess Journal closed in 1875 and Brownson Jr. died soon after, leaving Thompson without a job. There were rumors that he may have been the victim of a racial lynching. However, the 1880 U.S. Census shows a Theophilus Thompson, 24 years of age, in his home state of Maryland working as an oysterman in Anne Arundel County. Later on, the 1920 census lists this person as a waterman in the oyster industry, overestimated as 69 year old, married to Alice C. (39 years old) and with two children (Dorene and Ellsworth) age 10 and 9. In the 1930 and 1940 censuses, he lived in Churchton, Maryland, with increasingly overestimated ages of 80 and 91 years.Search at CensusRecords.com The U.S. Chess Center in Washington D.C. hosts the Theophilus Thompson Chess Club in his honor on Saturday afternoons.

The game is currently in the open beta stage of development and is tentatively scheduled for release in July, 2009. Monato Esprit is free to download and uses the e-currency \\"MetaTIX\\" as its billing system. Gameplay Monato Esprit follows many of the traditional structures of other MMORPGs. Players take control of an avatar (or \\"character\\") within a persistent world. Characters explore the landscape, delve through dungeons, fight monsters, complete quests, and interact with NPCs as well as other players. Successfully defeating monsters and completing quests yields items and experience points. As characters gain levels, they have the opportunity to use more powerful skills and better equipment. Characters can group together into parties and work together to achieve short-term goals, or create guilds, which serve as long-term social networks. Combat Combat is designed to accommodate younger and casual players. The game features strictly player versus environment action and emphasizes cooperation between players. The interface is simple and primarily mouse-driven, with a third-person perspective and a movable camera. To enter combat, players click on monsters they encounter in the world. Each successful strike results in damage to the monster's hit points, while the monster attacks in turn. Characters that lose all their hit points are revived in the nearest safe point, and there is no further punishment for defeat. If a monster loses all of its hit points, it is defeated and can be looted for items. Party members can select various \\"looting modes\\" to determine how items are divided up. Each character has a number of skills to augment his or her combat potential. When characters gain a level, they receive a skill point that can be used to buy a rank in a skill. At least one rank is required to use a skill, and further ranks increase its effectiveness. The skills available for purchase are dependent on the character's level and class. Each class has its own unique skill roster, with more powerful skills becoming available as the character gains levels. Skills are broken into two categories: passive and active. Passive skills permanently increase the character's attributes and are always functioning. Active skills include attack spells, special melee strikes, healing, and temporary enchantments. Using an active skill costs mana, which limits the number of times a skill can be used over a short period. Inventory Characters earn items by defeating monsters, completing quests, and trading with other players. Items are stored in the character's inventory, which is divide into a number of bags with 16 slots each. Some items such as weapons take up an entire slot, while smaller items such as potions stack together in a single slot. Each character starts with two bags, and can gain more at higher levels. Players can map items to hotkeys by placing them in their \\"quick bar\\". Excess items can be stored in the bank. All cities in Monato Esprit provide access to the bank, which can hold an additional 25 slots of inventory. Characters also have 10 equipment slots for items that they wear, which include armor, jewelry, wings and weapons. Character models change to reflect what weapons and armor the character is currently wearing. Weapons and armor have endurance ratings that will lower over time as they are worn during combat. When an item's endurance rating reaches zero, it will become unusable. Items can be repaired by blacksmiths in cities at the cost of MetaTIX. Jewelry and wings do not have endurance ratings and never need repair. Some items can be combined to create new items with alchemy. Characters learn how to create items by finding alchemy recipes. Each recipe includes three to six types of ingredients. The more powerful the item, the more challenging it is to find the necessary ingredients. Common items made through alchemy include potions, which restore hit points and mana. Characters can also find enchantment scrolls that add magical bonuses to equipment. Enchantments can only be performed by Alchemist NPCs in cities, at the cost of MetaTIX. World=Setting Isildra, a city in Monato Esprit. The game takes place in Monato Esprit, a magical world where the dreams of the innocent have created a paradise of imagination. Monato Esprit is maintained by the Basileus Crystal, which focuses the energy of moonlight to power the world. Dreamers are ushered into the world by the radiance of the crystal to become Archons, a race of humanoids with wings. Archons have built great civilizations throughout the dreamworld and enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity. A short time before the setting of the game, a dark presence descended upon Monato Esprit and infected the Basileus Crystal, allowing Nightmares to manifest in the dreamworld. Nightmares corrupted the harmless plants and creatures of Monato Esprit and turned them into monsters. The Archons must now rise against these monsters to protect their fragile paradise. Players begin the game as a young dreamer who enters Monato Esprit for the first time. After receiving tutorial missions from several helpful Archons, the player can teleport to Isildra, the first city in the game. From that point, the player is free to adventure through the world as he or she wishes. Zones The world of Monato Esprit is divided into zones, which come in three categories: cities, countryside, and instance dungeons. City zones are urban settlements created by the Archons. They feature a large number of friendly NPCs and are completely free of monsters. Within city zones, players can receive and complete quests without fear of attack. Cities also serve as convenient meeting grounds for parties and guilds. Countryside zones are wilder areas of the world that have become infested with nightmares. Some countryside zones feature small Archon settlements with friendly NPCs, but these areas are not safe from monster attacks. Instance dungeons are special areas separated from the main world and can only be accessed through a gatekeeper. While inside an instance dungeon, characters' maps do not function, forcing players to find their own way through the maze. The objective for each dungeon is to find and defeat its boss. Although these areas are generically known as \\"dungeons\\", they come in a variety of visual styles, from catacombs to sunny forests. Crystals The world of Monato Esprit is powered by Crystals, which provide magical benefits to characters who stand near them. Red crystals heal hit points, blue crystals restore mana, and yellow crystals restore both. Because characters' hit points and mana do not naturally regenerate over time, crystals are a valuable resource for characters who are short on potions. Characters All player characters are young Archons, a race of winged humanoids. During character creation, players have the opportunity to customize their characters' appearance, modifying their gender, hair style, hair color, eye shape, and eye color. Players also choose a zodiac sign and season for their characters at creation. Archons receive bonuses such as an increase in attack damage or hit points depending on the sign and season to which they are aligned. Each player account can store up to three characters at one time. Classes All characters begin the game as a \\"Novice\\" until fifth level, at which point the player chooses one of six specialized classes. Class determines how many hit points and mana points characters receive each level, what equipment they can use, and which skills they can buy. Characters that have reached tenth level in a class can become \\"reborn\\" and restart in another class at level one. Available classes are: *Hwarang - The elite warriors of Monato Esprit, focusing on offensive melee combat. They fight with two-handed swords for maximum damage, and wear metal armor. Their skills include powerful sword strikes and elemental attacks. The class is based on the historical warrior society of Korea. *Templar - A society of powerful guardians who are charged with defending temples and other holy places. Templars specialize in defensive combat, wielding swords and shields and wearing metal armor. Their skills include powerful strikes as well as defensive enchantments that make them almost impossible to injure. The class is based on the medieval military order. *Mage - Masters of the four elements, Mages wield destructive magic. Their skills include long-range attack spells as well as enchantments that augment their offensive potential. They are physically weak, however, and only wear cloth armor. Their staffs serve as melee weapons and also increase the power of their spells. *Cleric - Holy caretakers of the dreamworld, Clerics use the healing power of dreams to protect and restore the wounded. This class serves a vital support role in any party, casting enchantments to protect and heal party members. Clerics are not particularly suited to melee combat. They wear cloth armor and wield wands that heighten the power of their magic. *Sheriff - These dedicated peace officers bring justice to the wild places in the dreamworld. Sheriffs specialize in long-range combat with firearms, and are the only Archons who are trained to use them. This class is based on the gunslinger archetype of the American Old West. *Harlequin - Cunning rogues who wander the dreamworld in search of adventure. Harlequins are known as much for their showmanship as their power, fighting with such daring that every combat becomes a work of art. This class is loosely based on the comical theater characters. In-game economy Monato Esprit is the first MMO to use the e-currency MetaTIX. Players purchase MetaTIX and use them like admission tickets to gain entrance to special areas in the world and purchase various services such as teleportation. MetaTIX also serve as the in-game currency for the world of Monato Esprit, much like \\"gold\\" in other MMOs, and can be used to purchase items from other players. There are no merchant NPCs in the game world, so all trade is conducted between players. This system allows the player community to determine items' value and regulate the economy without developer interference. The economic system in Monato Esprit is based on the research of Edward Castronova into the real world economy at work in EverQuest. Castronova discovered that a unit of currency in Norrath was worth more than the Yen or Lira, and playing EverQuest yielded more wealth per hour than the average wage of a Bulgarian worker.BBC NEWS  Technology  Virtual gaming worlds overtake NamibiaBBC News  SCI/TECH  Virtual kingdom richer than Bulgaria While other MMOs such as EverQuest and World of Warcraft attempt to restrict players from earning profit through gaming, Monato Esprit has built the concept into the game itself. Players can use the profits they earn in Monato Esprit to buy and play new games that accept the currency. Production Monato Esprit is under development by the Korean company Gamasoft. The English language release is being published by Reality Gap, Inc. The Russian language release in being published by IT Territory, LLC (part of Astrum Online Entertainment holding). The game is currently in the open beta stage of production.

His most famous works were An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry (five volumes) and A History of Chemistry (four volumes), for which he received the Dexter Award and the George Sarton Medal. Partington was a fellow and council member of the Chemical Society of London as well as the first president of the Society for History of Alchemy and Early Chemistry when it was founded in 1937. The society founded the Partington Prize in his memory in 1975. He was President of the British Society for the History of Science from 1949 to 1951. Biography=Early life and education  Partington was born on 30 June 1886 in the small village of Middle Hulton, south of Bolton, Lancashire. His mother, from whom he took his middle name, was a Scottish tailoress and his father was a book keeper. His family moved to Southport when he was young, allowing him to attend the Southport Science and Art School. In 1901 when he was 15, his family moved back to Bolton and Partington worked at several jobs before getting accepted into the University of Manchester in 1906.Brock, William H. \\"J. R. PARTINGTON (1886‚Äì1965): PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY IN DEED AND WORD.\\" N.p., 2009. Web. 4 November 2013 In Manchester, he attained a bachelor's degree in science followed by a master's degree in chemistry. While attending the University he was made a University Scholar and earned his teaching certificate. He was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,1851 Royal Commission Archives and worked with Walther Nernst in Berlin for several years where they studied the specific heat of gases. In 1913, Partington returned to Manchester to lecture on chemistry. It was there that Partington met a student named Marian Jones whom he taught and supervised for a master's degree in supersaturated solutions.M. Jones & J. R. Partington, \\"Experiments on Supersaturated Solutions,\\" Trans. Chem. Soc., 1915 Partington married her after the war on 6 September 1919. She went on to become a chemistry teacher before giving birth to two daughters and one son, who also became a chemist.Brock, William H. (Illinois, 2009) Partington joined the army in 1914 as World War I began in Eastern Europe. He was first assigned to work with Eric Rideal on the purification of water for troops on the Somme. Later the two chemists turned to the question of the oxidation of nitrogen to form nitric acid and investigated the Haber-Bosch process that the Germans were pursuing. Thus, he was transferred to a group led by Frederick G. Donnan, which worked on the production of nitric acid for munitions. Captain Partington was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Military Division for this latter work. Outside his war work for the government, Partington managed to continue with thermodynamics, joining the Faraday Society in 1915. In 1919 he presented a major review of the literature on the dilution law to the Faraday Society, to whose Council he was elected that same year.L. Sutton & M. Davies, The History of the Faraday Society, London: Royal Society of Chemistry, 1996 Career and works After the war came to an end in 1919, he returned to the University of Manchester to get his doctorate and was appointed Professor of Chemistry at Queen Mary College, London which he remained until 1951. While teaching, studied the theories of strong electrolytes as well the temperature dependence of specific heats. He also began writing several articles and books on the subject that were later published. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Partington's department was evacuated to Cambridge. Partington spent his war days studying and reading at the university's copyright library. Although accommodations had been made for families of staff, his wife stayed at their home in Wembley. She committed suicide in March 1940 and Partington was a widower for the remainder of his life.Academic Board Minutes, Queen Mary College, 16 May 1939. After the war, Partington returned to London where he devoted his time to complete his most famous works, the five-volume An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry and the four volume A History of Chemistry. Professor Partington collected a considerable library of works on the history of alchemy and chemistry which is preserved in the John Rylands Library. Later life and death He retired in 1951 to a house in Mill Road, Cambridge, and was looked after by an aged housekeeper. The house was filled with books from cellar to roof. According to Joseph Needham, he became something of a recluse, rarely stirring from his writing desk.The Times, 1965, 15 October 23. In 1961 Partington received the Dexter Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry from the American Chemical Society for his numerous articles and books on the history of chemistry, particularly his multi-volume A History of Chemistry. In 1965 he was awarded the George Sarton Medal, the most prestigious award of the History of Science Society.Brock, William H. (Illinois, 2009) . At the end of 1964, following his housekeeper's retirement, unable to look after himself, he joined relatives in the salt-mining town of Northwich in Cheshire, where he died on 9 October 1965. His extensive library and collections were donated to the Manchester University Library. Legacy Partington was a key figure in the fields of history of science and chemistry in the beginning half of the 20th century. He regularly published multiple papers a year on a variety of topics including inorganic and physical chemistry. He worked meticulously to get everything as close to perfect as possible in his experiments as well as his writings. Many describe him as a highly gifted scholar who had an \\"encyclopedic mind\\", that gave excellent training to his students from around the world. His works remain useful as they laid the groundwork for physical chemistry moving forward after both World Wars.

Samuel Robbins Brown D.D. (June 16, 1810 ‚Äì June 20, 1880) was an American missionary to China and Japan with the Reformed Church in America. Birth and education Brown was born in East Windsor, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale College in 1832, studied theology in Columbia, South Carolina and as a member of the first graduating class of Union Theological Seminary, and taught for four years (1834‚Äì38) at the New York Institution for the Deaf and Dumb. China In 1838 he went to Guangzhou and opened, for the Morrison Education Society, the first Protestant School in the Chinese Empire--a school in which were taught Yung Wing and other pupils who afterward came to the United States. The several annual reports on this school were published in The Chinese Repository for 1840 to 1846, to which he contributed some of his papers on Chinese subjects. Return to America After nine years' service, his wife's health failing, Brown returned to the United States and became a pastor at Sand Beach Church and teacher of boys at Owasco Outlet, near Auburn (1851‚Äì59). He worked for the formation of a college for women, which was situated first in Auburn and then in Elmira, New York and now known as Elmira College. Brown was responsible for sponsoring Yung Wing (1828-1912); the first Chinese student to graduate from a U.S. university, graduating from Yale College in 1854. Japan Guido Verbeck„ÄÅSamuel Robbins Brown„ÄÅDuane B. SimmonsWhen by the Harris Treaty of 1858, Kanagawa and Nagasaki in Japan were opened to trade and residence, Brown sailed for the former, arriving on November 3, 1859. On arrival, Brown shared residential accommodation with the family of the Presbyterian medical missionary Dr. James Curtis Hepburn, then residing at Jobutsuji in Kanagawa, a dilapidated temple formerly occupied by the Dutch consulate. Brown and Hepburn, both benefiting from the experience of living and working in China, were noted pioneers in the study of the Japanese language. In collaboration with Dr. Hepburn and others, Brown made substantial contributions to the translation of the New Testament into Japanese. Brown was also a gifted teacher, Ernest Satow, then a student interpreter at the British legation, who many years later became British Consul to Japan, described the Japanese language lessons received from Brown to be, \\"of the greatest value.\\" Brown began presiding at Christian ecumenical religious services held at the Jobutsuji in Kanagawa from the second Sunday after his arrival in November 1859. In July 1860, at the request of English-speaking merchants in Yokohama, Brown begun to preach regularly at Sunday morning service that attracted 30 to 40 congregants each week. In 1861 Brown also contributed to drawing up the plans and specifications for the British Anglican Garrison Church built on Lot 105 in the foreign settlement. The Garrison Church, also known as Christ Church, was the forerunner of Christ Church, Yokohama, rebuilt in 1901 on a prominent position on the Bluff overlooking the Port of Yokohama. On Lot 167 in the heart of the Kannai commercial district, Brown was also able to establish a Reformed Church, later named in 1872 as Union Church, Yokohama. At Yokohama, Brown also opened a school in which hundreds of young men, afterwards leaders in various walks of life, were educated. Brown acted as honorary chaplain to the United States legation, teaching and preaching for over 20 years. He was one of the founders of the Asiatic Society of Japan and a prominent contributor to early Meiji Period higher education. Following a fire that destroyed much of his home, personal library, manuscripts, and notes, Brown returned to the United States for a two-year furlough in May 1867. In June of the same year he was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Divinity by New York University. Brown returned to Japan in 1869, arriving at Yokohama on August 26, to take up a new position as principal of a government funded school in Niigata. The Niigata sojourn was only brief; desiring to be close to his fellow New Testament translators, Brown accepted a new teaching post and relocated back to Yokohama in 1870. Brown, suffering from ill health, left Japan for the United States in the Autumn of 1879. Death Brown died during his sleep, while visiting an old friend in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and is buried at Monson, Massachusetts, his boyhood home.

The island was purchased by Andrew and Julia Dixon, an Australian couple visiting Bintan, in 2005 and developed, with the aid of a group of financiers, into a boutique private island resort named Nikoi Island. The resort opened in 2007, and as of 2010 consists of fifteen beach houses.http://www.nikoi.com/about.html The island has been ranked as one of the best private islands in the world by Cond√© Nast Traveller and reviewed extensively by the world's travel press. The island has a maximum height of thirty metres, and consists of white sand beaches studded with white granite boulders, with coral reef off-shore. Two thirds of the island is Banyan forest, home to various bird species, while turtles are said to nest on the island's beaches. The resort is marketed as an eco-resort, with the use of driftwood as a construction material and alang alang grass as roofing. A double-layered roof design improves ventilation and means that rooms do not require air conditioning. Solar panels are use for heating water and a hybrid solar PV array provides renewal energy for up to 12 hours a day. Diesel generators are required for water pumping and refrigeration. As part of the operators' commitment to sustainable tourism, a non-governmental organization (NGO) called The Island Foundation was registered as a charity in Singapore in 2009 to support the community on Bintan Island. The resort was a runner-up in Wild Asia's 2009 and 2012 Responsible Tourism Awards (Mid-size to Small Accommodation Operators category) and went on to win this award the in 2015. The resort has gone on to win or be a finalist in many other responsible tourism awards notably National Geographic's inaugural World Legacy Awards in 2014. Nikoi is also a member of The Long Run, a group dedicated to achieving sustainability through the balance of the 4Cs (conservation, community, culture and commerce).

Taxonomy The greater striped swallow was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in the Cape of Good Hope district of South Africa. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Hirundo cucullata in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The greater striped swallow is now one of nine species that are placed in the genus Cecropis that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826. The species is monotypic and no subspecies are recognised. The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek Kekropis \\"Athenian woman\\". The specific epithet cucullata is from the Late Latin cucullatus meaning \\"hooded\\". Description The greater striped swallow is long. It has dark blue upperparts with a pale orange rump and a chestnut crown, nape and sides of the head. The underparts and underwing coverts are creamy white with dark streaking, and the upper wings and underwing flight feathers are blackish- brown. The blackish tail has very long outer feathers; these are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller and browner, with less contrast and shorter outer tail feathers. The flight is slow and buoyant, and the call is a twittering chissick. This species can be distinguished from the smaller lesser striped swallow, Hirundo abyssinica, in that the latter species has heavier and darker underparts striping, a deeper red rump, and rufous rather than buffy ear coverts. The lesser striped swallow also prefers less open habitats. Distribution and habitat It breeds in southern Africa, mainly in South Africa, Namibia and southern Zimbabwe. It is migratory wintering further north in Angola, Tanzania and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Behaviour and ecology The greater striped swallow is common, unafraid of humans, and has benefited from the availability of nest sites around habitation. It feeds mainly on flying insects, but has been known to eat small fruits. It is a bird of dry open country, such as grassland, and has a preference for hills and mountains. It avoids more wooded areas, but is often found around human habitation. Breeding Nest built of mud pellets The greater striped swallow builds a bowl-shaped mud nest with a tubular entrance on the underside of a suitable structure. The nest has a soft lining, and is often reused in later years. The nest may be built in a cave or under a rock overhang or fallen tree. This species has benefited from its willingness to use buildings, bridges, culverts and similar man-made structures. Given the choice, it will select a high nest site. The eggs are glossy white with a few brown spots; three eggs is a typical clutch. Incubation is by the female alone for 17 to 20 days to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 23 to 30 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight.

Connor was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast- medium bowler. Career Connor left his home island of Anguilla in 1979 to pursue a cricketing career in England. Connor was signed by Buckinghamshire in 1979 and remained at the club for five years playing in the Minor Counties Championship. Connor was eventually spotted by former Hampshire cricketer Charlie Knott who recommended him to Hampshire, who signed him for the 1984 season. Connor made his first-class debut for Hampshire against Somerset. This was to the first of Connor's 221 first-class matches for the club. The same year Connor made his List-A debut against Nottinghamshire in the John Player Special League. Connor would go on to play 300 one-day matches for the club. Connor formed a deadly partnership with his fellow West Indian new ball bowler Malcolm Marshall, often trying to compete with his partner for pace. Connor was a member of the 1988 Benson and Hedges Cup Hampshire team, taking two wickets in the final at Lord's. A further honour came in 1991 when Connor was again a member of the Hampshire winning team, this time in the 1991 NatWest Trophy where he took three wickets, including that of future England batsman Graham Thorpe for 93. There was call for Connor being called up to the England one-day squad, but this never materialised. Connor tasted success for a second time in the Benson and Hedges Cup, this time in 1992 when Hampshire beat Kent. Connor took a single wicket in the match, that of Mark Ealham. In 1994 he was named the Hampshire Cricket Society Player of the Year. By this time Connor was something of a cult figure at the County Ground. Connor took his best innings bowling figures during the 1996 County Championship. In a match against Gloucestershire he took 9/38, this at a time when Malcolm Marshall had retired. Connor made his final first-class appearance for Hampshire in a County Championship match against Derbyshire in 1998, although that season he played just four first-class matches for the club. His final one-day appearance came on 13 September 1998 in an AXA League match against Worcestershire. Connor retired at the end of the 1998 season. In total Connor took over 1,000 wickets for Hampshire. Testament to Connor's cult figure at the club, his benefit year raised ¬£147,000. After cricket After retiring from cricket, Connor returned to Anguilla. He was Anguilla's 'chef de mission' (team manager) at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Connor currently works as a hotel masseur and a fitness coach, with a website calling him \\"the island's most popular personal trainer\\". At the Anguillan general election in April 2015 Connor was elected in District 7 - West End for the Anguilla United Front.

The acknowledgement of \\"mistakes\\" is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who made the mistakes. A less evasive construction might be along the lines of \\"I made mistakes\\" or \\"John Doe made mistakes\\". The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word \\"mistakes\\" also does not imply intent. The New York Times has called the phrase a \\"classic Washington linguistic construct.\\" Political scientist William Schneider suggested that this usage be referred to as the \\"past exonerative\\" tense, and commentator William Safire has defined the phrase as \\"[a] passive-evasive way of acknowledging error while distancing the speaker from responsibility for it\\".William Safire, Safire's Political Dictionary (2008), p. 431.

Biography David Kl√∂cker was born in Hamburg. He was the son of Johann Kl√∂cker and had eight siblings. In 1648, Kl√∂cker traveled to Amsterdam where he learned how to paint following the instructions from Juriaen Jacobsze (1624‚Äì1685). In 1652, he left his art studies in the Netherlands and moved to Skokloster Castle (Skoklosters slott) on Lake M√§laren, Sweden at the request of Swedish noblemann Carl Gustaf Wrangel (1613‚Äì1676). Between 1654 and 1661 he studied in Italy and visited the courts of both France and England. On his return he became entitled Court painter (hovkonterfejare) in 1661. He was raised to the nobility in 1674 at which time he took the surname Ehrenstr√•hl. He became court intendant in 1690. He made portraits of, among others, King Charles XI of Sweden, Erik Dahlbergh, Georg Stiernhielm and Agneta Horn. Among his pupils can be found Mikael Dahl and David von Krafft as well as his daughter Anna Maria Ehrenstrahl . Ehrenstrahl also painted several ceilings and large wall pieces with allegoric motifs. The great hall ceiling fresco, named The Great Deeds of The Swedish Kings, in the Swedish House of Knights (Riddarhuspalatset) made between 1670 and 1675, is considered to be his greatest work. A second version was made during 1695 on the ceiling of Ehrenstrahlsalongen at Drottningholm Palace, the home of the Swedish Royal Family. The center piece of the Drottningholm fresco also became the motive of the 1000th postage stamp designed by Polish postage stamp and banknote engraver Czes≈Çaw S≈Çania (1921-2005). The stamp was issued by the PostNord Sverige in March 2000. Ehrenstr√•hl is also known for his proposal, in 1694, that: \\\\- \\"Art presents riddles that could not be solved by everyone\\".

These are often adjacent, but may be separated by a later feature.

Vlastivƒõdn√° knihovna moravsk√°, Sv. 74. . England Although agriculture was practised earlier, the earliest recognisable field systems in England are neolithic. Cairnfields, which are pre-historic in date, are found in upland areas. They contain scattered stones and boulders and originated in surface clearance for agriculture.Field Systems, English Heritage, May, 2011 So called Celtic fields can date from the Bronze Age through to the early Middle Ages. These fields are typically small and rectangular. (However, he says the term \\"celtic fields\\" is \\"totally misleading and meaningless.\\") They are frequently coaxial - that is they form a system in which the boundaries of adjacent fields make a series of long, roughly parallel lines. The extensive coaxial field systems established by the Romans are described as centuriation. Grendon, Northamptonshire Open fields were very large fields in which many individual farmers cultivated their own strips. These were a frequently found feature in the Midlands but less so in the South-east and West country. No documents survive which explain how and when the change to open fields took place, but signs of the change are apparent in some areas in the 8th, 9th or 10th centuries. The use of open fields began to decline in the 15th century. The landscape of open fields was frequently called \\"champion country\\". In England, enclosure of open fields during the 18th and 19th century produced field systems with larger rectangular fields, often with blackthorn hedges. Adjacent areas were often enclosed at different times, leading to a change in orientation of the field systems between the two areas. The pattern of ridge and furrow will often reveal the layout of the original open fields. In parts of England where enclosure took place early (or which were never enclosed), fields are often small and have an irregular shape, sometimes described as \\"pocket handkerchief\\". Recent changes of agricultural practice are eliminating old field boundaries, particularly by removing hedges, to produce much larger fields reminiscent of traditional open fields. Ireland The most famous ancient field system in Ireland is the C√©ide Fields, an extensive series of stone walls dating back to 3500 BC. Similar stone wall field systems dating back to the Atlantic Bronze Age are visible in western Ireland and on the Aran Islands. The primitive ard plough used in Gaelic Ireland only scratched the surface of the soil, so cross-ploughing was necessary to break up the earth better. This favoured square fields, so groups of square-shaped fields are likely to have been laid out in the pre-Norman period. The Normans brought the heavy plough to Ireland in the 12th century. This favoured long rectangular fields, so groups of fields with that shape are likely to postdate the Norman invasion of Ireland. The open-field system (\\"champion system\\") predominated in medieval Ireland. In the better land of the eastern part of the island, a manorial system similar to that of the rest of Europe as practiced. Strips of land belonging to the village farmers lay in two or three enormous open fields, each cultivated with the same crop on an agreed cycle ‚Äî typically a three-year cycle of cereal, then legume, then fallow. In marginal land (especially the high-rainfall west of Ireland), the rundale system was used. The land was divided into discontinuous plots, and cultivated and occupied by a number of tenants to whom it is leased jointly. Houses were clustered in a clach√°n on the better land (\\"infield\\"), which was surrounded by mountainous or grazing land of lower quality (\\"outfield\\") where livestock (sheep, cattle) were grazed during summer or dry periods (booleying). Only the infield was fertilised with manure. The outfield might be used to grow oats after a few years of lying fallow. The present system of fields in Ireland dates to the 17th‚Äì18th century onwards, with enclosure of land by ditches (stone-and-sod banks) and hedgerows (made of hawthorn, beech and sycamore), with a centrally located farmhouse and farmyard, being the hallmark of \\"improvement.\\" Rapid population expansion prior to the Great Famine (1845‚Äì49) resulted in fragmentation of farms and fields. After the famine, continuous emigration resulted in consolidation or abandonment of fields. Relicts of these deserted villages and clach√°ns are still visible in the form of lazy beds and drystone walls. The hedgerows that divide most of the fields of Ireland are estimated to run for over and cover a greater land area than forests or national parks.https://www.heritagecouncil.ie/content/files/historic_landscape_characterisation_guidance_2013_8mb.pdf Wales Where early fields survive in Wales, most are associated with settlement features that indicate an Iron Age or Romano-British date. However buried soils as well peat pollen cores indicate earlier land-use of these areas and radiocarbon dates suggest a limited amount of woodland clearance as early as the Later Mesolithic Canada The field system of French settlers in Quebec along the St. Lawrence River was arranged in narrow plots extending away from the river, to allow houses along the river and relatively close together. See Seigneurial system of New France. Identifying former field systems The boundaries of earlier field systems that have fallen out of use, can sometimes be deduced by studying earthworks (lumps and bumps), cropmarks or by using geophysics. Studying early maps will often show the field system in use at the time the map was prepared. From the mid 17th century, landowners began to commission estate maps that show the size and layout of the fields they own. However, for many English parishes, the earliest written evidence of their field system is from the enclosure maps or tithe maps. It is often possible to draw conclusions about relative age by looking at how field boundaries meet. Later boundaries will often abut, but not cross earlier boundaries. Drawing conclusions from analysis of field systems Fields were organised for the convenience of the farmer - both arable and pastoral. Therefore, the size of fields often gives an indication of the type of agriculture and agricultural implements in use when they were established. The shape and orientation of collections of fields provides clues about the date they were established. Field systems can give an indication of land ownership and social structure. The extent to which the field system respects other features (or not) can be used as dating evidence for the other features or the field system itself. For example, a field system that doesn't respect a Roman road is likely to predate it. Similarly, a feature that respects medieval ridge and furrow is likely to post date it. The Rodings (the largest group of parishes in England to bear a common name) (Registration required.) was investigated by Steven Basset. Basset showed that a broadly rectilinear field system (and other features such as roads) continued across parish boundaries thus showing that the field system pre-dated the formation of parishes. He therefore concluded that they had originally been a single estate.

It is primarily found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and other cultured salmonids. The disease is characterized by subcutaneous hemorrhaging of the mouth, fins, and eyes. It is most commonly seen in fish farms with poor water quality. Redmouth disease was first discovered in Idaho rainbow trout in the 1950s.LSC - Fish Disease Leaflet 82 The disease does not infect humans. Distribution of disease Some fish species serve as vectors for the disease and have subsequently spread the pathogen to other parts of the world. An example is the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) which is responsible for the spread of redmouth disease to trout in Europe. Other vectors include the goldfish (Carassius auratus), Atlantic and Pacific salmon (Salmo salar), the emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), and farmed whitefish (Coregonus spp.). Infections have also occurred in farmed turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and seabream (Sparus auratus). It can now be found in North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia, as well as Europe. Clinical signs and diagnosis Infection can cause subcutaneous haemorrhage that presents as reddening of the throat, mouth, gill tips, and fins, and eventual erosion of the jaw and palate. Hemorrhaging also occurs on internal organs, and in the later stages of the disease, the abdomen becomes filled with a yellow fluid - giving the fish a \\"pot-bellied\\" appearance. The fish often demonstrate abnormal behavior and anorexia. Mortality rates can be high. A presumptive diagnosis can be made based in the history and clinical signs, but definitive diagnosis requires bacterial culture and serological testing such as ELISA and latex agglutination. Treatment and control Several antibiotics are available for the treatment of redmouth disease in fish. Vaccines can also be used in the treatment and prevention of disease. Management factors such as maintaining water quality and a low stocking density are essential for disease prevention.

Other theatre credits include Stephen Sondheim's Assassins; Mark Ravenhill's play Mother Clap's Molly House, La Cage aux Folles, Get Happy and What The World Needs Now. He has also performed three one-man shows ‚Äì Give Us A Break, Ikonika and The Sweet and Low Down. His television and film credits include ABC's The Wizard of Solmar, Southern Star Group's Young Lions and Moulin Rouge! He died suddenly in May 2014. Priscilla Queen of the Desert - the Musical The role of Adam/Felicia, made famous in the film by Guy Pearce, was seen to promote Scott from company member to leading man status. Despite garnering good reviews for his performance, he has been injured on two separate occasions, causing him to leave the show temporarily as Nick Hardcastle took over the role. Scott expressed to the press that playing the role of Adam/Felicia meant a lot to him: \\"Doing something like this, there are more messages that I can send with Adam other than he is just a cute young kid that is messed up. I can show a mirror of the good and the bad side of the community.\\" With the role, and having come out at the age of 13, he felt a sense of responsibility to be a gay role model.

Jr. \\"Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering,\\" John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Danvers, MA. (2005)/ Burgers vectors The vector's magnitude and direction is best understood when the dislocation- bearing crystal structure is first visualized without the dislocation, that is, the perfect crystal structure. In this perfect crystal structure, a rectangle whose lengths and widths are integer multiples of \\"a\\" (the unit cell edge length) is drawn encompassing the site of the original dislocation's origin. Once this encompassing rectangle is drawn, the dislocation can be introduced. This dislocation will have the effect of deforming, not only the perfect crystal structure, but the rectangle as well. The said rectangle could have one of its sides disjoined from the perpendicular side, severing the connection of the length and width line segments of the rectangle at one of the rectangle's corners, and displacing each line segment from each other. What was once a rectangle before the dislocation was introduced is now an open geometric figure, whose opening defines the direction and magnitude of the Burgers vector. Specifically, the breadth of the opening defines the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and, when a set of fixed coordinates is introduced, an angle between the termini of the dislocated rectangle's length line segment and width line segment may be specified. When calculating the Burgers vector practically, one may draw a rectangular clockwise circuit from a starting point to enclose the dislocation (see the picture above). The Burgers vector will be the vector from the START to the END of the circuit. The direction of the vector depends on the plane of dislocation, which is usually on one of the closest-packed crystallographic planes. The magnitude is usually represented by the equation (For BCC and FCC lattices only): :: mathbf{b} = (a/2)\\\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2} where a is the unit cell edge length of the crystal, b is the magnitude of Burgers vector and h, k, and l are the components of the Burgers vector, b = (a/2) \\\\langle h k l \\\\rangle , and the coefficient a/2 is owing to the fact that in BCC and FCC lattices, the shortest lattice vectors could be as expressed (a/2) \\\\langle h k l \\\\rangle . Comparatively, for simple cubic lattices, b = a \\\\langle h k l \\\\rangle and hence the magnitude is represented by :: mathbf{b} = a\\\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2} In most metallic materials, the magnitude of the Burgers vector for a dislocation is of a magnitude equal to the interatomic spacing of the material, since a single dislocation will offset the crystal lattice by one close-packed crystallographic spacing unit. In edge dislocations, the Burgers vector and dislocation line are perpendicular to one another. In screw dislocations, they are parallel.Kittel, Charles, \\"Introduction to Solid State Physics,\\" 7th edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, (1996) pp 592‚Äì593. The Burgers vector is significant in determining the yield strength of a material by affecting solute hardening, precipitation hardening and work hardening. The Burgers vector plays an important role in determining the direction of dislocation line.

The EUR.1 is most importantly recognized as a certificate of origin in the external trade in legal sense, especially within the framework of several bi- and multilateral agreements of the Pan-European preference system (the European Union Association Agreement).  Explanation  Each free trade agreement (bi- and multi-lateral) states which products are covered, and which ones can benefit from lower (or none) rates of duty. The condition of \\"origin\\" is that the products must have been completely manufactured, processed or transformed in a member country.  Issuance  The applicant for the EUR.1 (the exporter) must be able to prove the origin of the goods, which is usually done via presentation of the supplier invoice stating the product origin. This is called the supplier's declaration (SD). The exporter then fills in the EUR.1 application form, and hands it over to the competent authorities (usually the customs office) along with the supplier's invoice. The authorities certify the form with a stamp and send it back to the exporter.  Use  The EUR.1 is used to certify the origin of a product, and if applicable, benefit from favorable trade terms (tariffs mainly) under a preferential trade policy of the EU. In order to benefit from the preferential rate during a customs clearance, a valid EUR.1 movement certificate must be handed over to the competent authority (likely a customs office), in which the manufacturer certifies the origin of the goods. In place of a movement certificate, a simple declaration of origin on the invoice can be provided by the manufacturer or sender of the goods in place of a proper movement certificate: this is called an invoice declaration. This is an accepted alternative to the EUR.1 only if the number of items with EU preferential origin under a single shipment does not exceed at certain amount (for a non-approved exporter). If it concerns an approved exporter (that is, a regular authorized exporter), this value limit does not apply.TAXUD: Generalised System of Preferences The EUR.1 is valid between 4 and 10 months. Participating countries The following countries participate in trade agreements where the EUR.1 is used: * in Africa: Tunisia, South Africa, Algeria. Egypt, Morocco, Kenya * in the Americas: Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Republica Dominicana * in Europe: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Faroe Islands, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Republic of Moldova, Ukraine * in the Middle East: Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria * in the ACP countries, this is regulated through the Cotonou-agreement, which is not a traditional FTA, but rather a non-reciprocal agreement.

And also, much to the delight of players, it gave detailed information on how to play the races as characters. Races explored were the major races dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orc, halflings, humans, and planetouched, as well as minor races, aarakocra, centaurs, goblinoids, kir-lanan, lizardfolk, lycanthropes, shades, wemics, and yuan-ti, and the various subraces (in the case of humans, ethnic groups) of each of the races. A handful of new feats, spells, magic items, prestige classes, and monsters are also given. The book does not detail all of the races in the Forgotten Realms setting. Some other races which are known to inhabit it, including gnolls, naga, thri-kreen, loxos, fey, giants, ogres, trolls, sahuagin, saurials, and numerous others, are left out, as well as a lot of the human ethnic groups and a few elven subraces.

I'd turn in my work to Sean Reynolds, and he'd go through it and fix all the stuff that was broken (or more often, make some suggestions to me on how to fix them), and then I'd go over it again.

Synopsis  The book is about Josh Tambling who is well loved and cared for by his Mum and Dad. Josh and his mates have formed a grunge metal band and dream of being rock gods. But when he lands a holiday job in the Lost Property Office at Sydney's Central station, Josh starts to sense the loss of some important things in his life. One is that his brother Michael has drifted off and will not let anyone know where he is. The stress this is putting on his family grows, so when Josh discovers a clue to Michael's whereabouts while handling lost items in his work, he sets out to find him. Josh Tambling is the son of a famous footballer and a very well known radio station host. He is in a band with his mates. He has a girlfriend named Alicia. During the holidays he works at the Lost Property office. On his first day a lady requests a coat and Josh gives it to her but she doesn't find what she really wanted, a brooch. Josh's supervisor, Clive, explains that sometimes they separate clothing and other valuable items. Clive finds the brooch in that was kept in the safe and it belongs to the woman. She is overcome with emotion and explains that even though it is of little monetary value, it is a family heirloom and very important to her. Here, Josh realises how important small things can be to people. He goes for a band practice with his boys and they meet his friend Steve's sister, Gemma. The next night Josh goes to Alicia's house and goes into the pool. They play around and look at the stars and Josh confesses that he believes that the universe is big for no reason. His trust in God slowly decreases. He goes to work again and in the afternoon goes for another band practice. He talks to Gemma about the same conversation he had with Alicia and she responds that there is more out there than just a big waste of space. The band decide to go to The Domain for New Year's Eve. When they go Josh sits next to Alicia and his friend Neven sits next to Gemma and their relationship is revealed. That evening Josh finds himself dwelling on the last thing Clive said to him, which was ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, two in the hand is worth three in the bush‚Äù. Josh is in the train home when he answers to a calling, he starts picking up all the lost plastic in his carriage then follows on to do all the carriages. He continues to do this on another train, then another until he reaches Cronulla Station. There was not a train until 5:30am. He was lost.

Naming and Necessity. Harvard University Press: 22. The transcript was brought out originally in 1972 in Semantics of Natural Language, edited by Donald Davidson and Gilbert Harman. Among analytic philosophers, Naming and Necessity is widely considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.Soames, Scott. 2005. Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning. Princeton University Press. Cited in Byrne, Alex and Hall, Ned. 2004. 'Necessary Truths'. Boston Review October/November 2004. Overview Language is a primary concern of analytic philosophers, particularly the use of language to express concepts and to refer to individuals. In Naming and Necessity, Kripke considers several questions that are important within analytic philosophy: *How do names refer to things in the world? (the problem of intensionality) *Are all statements that can be known a priori necessarily true, and are all statements that are known a posteriori contingently true? *Do objects (including people) have any essential properties? *What is the nature of identity? *How do natural kind terms refer and what do they mean? Kripke's three lectures constitute an attack on descriptivist theories of proper names. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein and John Searle, among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name's being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render descriptivism implausible as a theory of how names get their reference determined (e.g., surely Aristotle could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, and yet it would seem wrong to deny that he was Aristotle). As an alternative, Kripke outlined a causal theory of reference, according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are rigid designators: A proper name refers to the named object in every possible world in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, 'Nixon' refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while 'the person who won the United States presidential election of 1968' could refer to Nixon, Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds. Kripke also raised the prospect of a posteriori necessities‚Äîfacts that are necessarily true, though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include \\"Hesperus is Phosphorus\\", \\"Cicero is Tully\\", \\"Water is H2O\\" and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object. Finally, Kripke gave an argument against identity materialism in the philosophy of mind, the view that every mental fact is identical with some physical fact (See talk). Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an a posteriori necessary identity, but that such an identity‚Äîe.g., pain is C-fibers firing‚Äîcould not be necessary, given the possibility of pain that has nothing to do with C-fibers firing. Similar arguments have been proposed by David Chalmers.Chalmers, David. 1996. The Conscious Mind. Oxford University Press pp. 146-9. Kripke delivered the John Locke lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973. Titled Reference and Existence, they are in many respects a continuation of Naming and Necessity, and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. They have recently been published by Oxford University Press. Quentin Smith has claimed that some of the ideas in Naming and Necessity were first presented (at least in part) by Ruth Barcan Marcus.Smith, Quentin. Marcus, Kripke, and the Origin of The New Theory of Reference, Synthese, Volume 104, No. 2, August 1995, pp. 179-189. Kripke is alleged to have misunderstood Marcus' ideas during a 1969 lecture which he attended (based on the questions he asked), and later arrived at similar conclusions. Marcus, however, has refused to publish the verbatim transcript of the lecture. Smith's view is controversial, and several well- known scholars (for example, Stephen Neale and Scott Soames) have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that his account is mistaken.Stephen Neale (9 February 2001). \\"No Plagiarism Here\\" (.PDF). Times Literary Supplement 104: 12‚Äì13. http://web.gc.cuny.edu/philosophy/people/neale/papers/NealeKripke.pdf.  A theory of naming  In the first lecture, Kripke introduced a schematic semi-formal version of the kind of \\"theory of naming\\" he was criticising (1980:64‚Äì65).\\"David Kaplan's investigation of 'Dthat', mentioned in footnote 22 [of Naming and necessity], has been extended to a 'logic of demonstratives' in which, he says, a good deal of the argument of this paper [Naming] can be given a formal representation. Indeed a good deal of this paper suggests a certain formal apparatus, though the present presentation is informal.\\" Kripke (1980): 164. He began the second lecture by recapitulating the \\"theses\\" of this theory, together with the \\"noncircularity condition\\" he had discussed in closing the first lecture. Apparently, the theses and condition had been written up on a board for all to see. This text was reproduced, as quoted below, in the \\"lightly edited\\" transcript of 1980 (p. 71). # To every name or designating expression 'X', there corresponds a cluster of properties, namely the family of those properties œÜ such that A believes 'œÜX'. # One of the properties, or some conjointly, are believed by A to pick out some individual uniquely. # If most, or a weighted most, of the œÜ's are satisfied by one unique object y, then y is the referent of 'X'. # If the vote yields no unique object, 'X' does not refer. # The statement, 'If X exists, then X has most of the œÜ's' is known a priori by the speaker. # The statement, 'If X exists, then X has most of the œÜ's' expresses a necessary truth (in the idiolect of the speaker). :(C) For any successful theory, the account must not be circular. The properties which are used in the vote must not themselves involve the notion of reference in such a way that it is ultimately impossible to eliminate. Lecture I: January 20, 1970 Kripke's main goals in this first lecture are to explain and critique the existing philosophical opinions on the way that names work. In the mid-20th century, the most significant philosophical theory about the nature of names and naming was a theory of Gottlob Frege's that had been developed by Bertrand Russell, the descriptivist theory of names, which was sometimes known as the 'Frege‚ÄìRussell description theory'. Before Kripke gave his 'Naming and Necessity' lectures, a number of criticisms of this descriptivist theory had been published by leading philosophers, including Ludwig Wittgenstein, John Searle and Peter Strawson. However, Kripke believed that the existing arguments against the Frege‚ÄìRussell descriptive theory of names failed to identify the real problems with the theory. Lecture II: January 22, 1970 In 'Lecture II', Kripke reconsiders the cluster theory of names and argues for his own position on the nature of reference, a position that contributed to the development of the causal theory of reference. Lecture III: January 29, 1970 In 'Lecture III', Kripke's main aim is to develop his account of the necessity of identity relations, and to discuss many of the implications of his account to issues like the identity of natural kinds, the distinction between epistemic and metaphysical necessity, the notion of metaphysical essences, and the mind‚Äìbody problem in philosophy of mind. Kripke begins by summarizing the conclusions drawn in the first two lectures. Central to his previous lectures was his attack on the descriptivist theory of reference. Kripke offers two lines of criticism against Descriptivism. First, he points out that descriptions believed by speakers about a referent are not uniquely specifying, and thus are incapable of fixing reference. His second line of criticism states that even in those limited cases where the speaker does believe something uniquely specifying, what is uniquely specified turns out not to be the referent. Two other issues arise by way of recapitulation: First, Kripke concedes that there exist certain limited cases where descriptions do in fact determine reference. In these cases, however, they do no other semantic work. They don't allow us to characterize names as abbreviations or synonyms of the description. Second, Kripke argues that while some philosophers offer a revisionary account of identity, this revisionary account is inadequate, and we must instead stay with the standard account of identity, which is not a relation between names, but a relation between an object and itself. The referent of names is usually determined by a series of causal links between people who have used the name. Second, when the referent of a name is determined by a property attributed to the thing named, the link is contingent, rather than necessary or essential. People begin using the name 'Jack the Ripper' to refer to the person responsible for the murder of five women in London. So, the name was fixed to its referent by a description. However, the person who carried out the murders might have been jailed for another crime and, thus, might never have had the property of murdering those women. So, the link between the property of being a murderer and the person referred to is contingent. Third, identity is not a relation that holds between names. It is a relation that holds between an object and itself. When someone accurately claims that two names refer to the same object, the claim is necessarily true, even though it may be known a posteriori. Thus, Kripke claims to have successfully refuted the assumption made by everyone before him that anything that is necessarily true will be known a priori (i.e. Immanuel Kant 1781/1787).

Morley was born in Blackheath and educated at Beccles, King's School, Peterborough and Epsom College. After living on the Isle of Wight in his father's house at Cowes, he moved in 1892 to Ipswich where worked with John E. Taylor, then Curator of the Ipswich museum. He married in 1904, living in Monk Soham until his death. He had no radio, telephone, or electricity in his house.E.A. Elliott was a close friend as was Arthur Chitty. Morley worked first on Coleoptera, then Hemiptera and then Ichneumonidae. His magnum opus was the five volume Ichneumons of Great Britain (1903-1914). Morley's collection of mainly Suffolk material covering the period 1898-1951 is in Ipswich Museum. It occupies c.260 drawers. There are Cerambycids bearing his name in the Kauffmann collection at Manchester. Morley was a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London 1896.

It came out from the union of the two co- operative central associations at that time of Deutscher Raiffeisenverband and the Deutscher Genossenschaftsverband e.V. and is responsible for promoting co- operative ideals.  Tasks  The DGRV represents the common interests of the cooperative organization in economics, right and tax political affairs in relation to the public, the media and the policy. Together with European and international organizations, for instance the CCACE (Coordinating Committee of European Associations) in Brussels, the ICA (International Co-operative Alliance) in Geneva or the European combination of the loan banks EACB (European Association of Co-operative Banks) in Brussels, the DGRV represents the interests of the German cooperatives on European level and worldwide. Besides the DGRV is member of the Internationalen Raiffeisen Union IRU, which is a platform for exchange of experience between the international cooperative organizations. In addition the DGRV advises its members in questions of the marketing and management, accounting and the co-operative examinations system. Furthermore the DGRV polices all examinations of the regional and federal centers, special institutes and federations for entrance of the co-operative group. In addition the DGRV promotes the emergence of cooperatives at home and abroad. Particularly in countries of the third world, in addition, in central and Eastern Europe, thereby the economic development is advanced. DGRV promotes the establishment of new cooperatives in Germany.  Structure  With the DGRV all cooperative sections are organized up to the housing cooperatives. The credit cooperatives, the rural and the commercial cooperatives as well as the consumer cooperatives are members. The DGRV is structured thus: * der Bundesverband der Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken e.V. * der Deutsche Raiffeisenverband e.V. * der Zentralverband gewerblicher Verbundgruppen e.V. * der Zentralverband deutscher Konsumgenossenschaften e.V.

Personal life Reyne's parents are the rock singer James Reyne and English- born model/stylist Kim Ellmer. He was educated in Melbourne, Australia at Scotch College. He has a son. Music career Between 2003 and 2004 Jaime played endless solo gigs in London to festivals in Australia. 2005 saw the independent release of his debut solo acoustic EP, Tex Sessions. In 2006 he formed Jaime Robbie Reyne & The Paradise Three. In March 2007 the band released their debut mini-Album, Fallen Flower, (through Green Media/MGM Distribution) to critical acclaim, from many renowned publications including Rolling Stone (Australia). The release was followed up with a national tour and performances at festivals including St Kilda Festival, Queenscliff Music Festival, Sovereign Hill Music Festival and The Australian Country Music Muster, just to name a few. Reyne then formed the group, Rushcutter with Vincent Daniele (guitar), Tim Wheatley (bass) and Brett Wolfenden (drums) in 2008. Wheatley is also the son of Glenn Wheatley, who also manages the band. They were quick to start writing/producing a handful of demo's and playing a batch of headline shows throughout Melbourne, before disembarking to the United States to further their sound. Upon returning to Australia in early 2009 Rushcutter were signed to Mercury Records/Universal working with American producer Niko Bolas, whom they met with in Nashville, on their debut release, Call High Water at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios. The four track EP was released in September 2009, with the title track becoming The Australian's song of the week. The next and final release for Rushcutter was 2010's \\"Foreign Soil\\" - (\\"a classic rock sound, with a contemporary pop-rock twist\\" The Music Network). After touring the record throughout Australia, \\"Rushcutter\\" called it quits due to \\"creative differences\\", seeing Jaime return to his solo career, touring Australia with American rock star Pat Benatar and vintage girl group The Bangles, as well as playing shows with Cloud Control, Thirsty Merc & Richard Clapton. His debut solo single \\"Remember To Breathe\\" (\\"a fine slice slice of rollicking pop\\" Jeff Jenkins Inpress) was released in May 2011 (through FR/Valleyarm). Jaime is currently touring \\"Remember To Breathe\\" throughout Australia & the US and working on his forthcoming album in Los Angeles. Acting career Reyne has appeared in numerous television shows, including Neighbours (where he played the fictional character of Taj Coppin, first appearing in 2002), and Horace and Tina. His theatre and Film productions include: Diablo is Done For, Evolution, Snow White and G7. In 2016, Reyne played Dan Delaney in The Secret Daughter alongside Jessica Mauboy.

Definition An edge city is a term coined by Joel Garreau's in his 1991 book Edge City: Life on the New Frontier, for a place in a metropolitan area, outside cities' original downtowns (thus, in the suburbs or, if within the city limits of the central city, an area of suburban density), with a large concentration of jobs, office space, and retail space. Originally, Garreau defined edge cities in the North American context, though he gave some examples outside North America. To qualify under Garreau's rules, an edge city:Chapter 11: \\"The List: Edge Cities Coast to Coast\\" in * has five million or more square feet (465,000 m¬≤) of leasable office space * has 600,000 square feet (56,000 m¬≤) or more of leasable retail space * has more jobs than bedrooms * is perceived by the population as one place * was nothing like a \\"city\\" as recently as 30 years ago.

Biography Nicolson was born Phyllis Lockett in Macclesfield and went to Stockport High School for Girls. She graduated from Manchester University with a B.Sc. in 1938, M.Sc. in 1939 and a Ph.D. in Physics in 1946. She was a research student in Cambridge from 1945 and a Tucker-Price Research Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge from 1946 to 1949. She married Malcolm Nicolson, also a physicist, in 1942 and had two sons. The family moved to Leeds where Malcolm Nicolson was appointed to a lectureship in Physics at Leeds University. Malcolm Nicolson died accidentally in 1951, and Phyllis was appointed to take over his lectureship. In 1955, she married physicist Malcolm McCaig by whom she had another son. She died from breast cancer in 1968 in Sheffield.  Work  During her time in Manchester, Nicolson worked with Douglas Hartree and became a proficient numerical analyst and an expert user of Hartree's differential analyser. Nicolson initially worked on cosmic ray problems, but after the outbreak of war Hartree's differential analyser group pursued defence-related problems. Two of the problems in her thesis are derived from work done for the Ministry of Supply. One of these problems was on solutions of the heat equation, and with her colleague John Crank she investigated the numerical stability of several solution techniques. The algorithm now known as the Crank‚ÄìNicolson method emerged from this work and was published in 1947.  Publications  * D.R. Hartree, P. Nicholson, N.Eyres. J. Howlett, and T.

Career Between 1966 and 1984, Brooks was Secretary of the Labour party for Cardiff South-East constituency. In the February 1974 and October 1974 general election, he contested Barry for Labour. Brooks was an elected Cardiff councillor for the Splott ward.\\"Jack Brooks\\", South Wales Echo, 25 February 2005. Retrieved 2013-05-04. He became leader of South Glamorgan County Council (SGCC), known for his \\"strong leadership style\\" and his effective control of the Labour Party group during the 1980s. When he replaced Reverend Bob Morgan as leader it was described as a 'coup', with Brooks deciding a tougher leadership was required. Brooks was widely seen as being enormously influential on the future leader of SGCC and Cardiff Council, Russell Goodway. On 17 July 1979, he became a life peer as Baron Brooks of Tremorfa, of Tremorfa in the County of Glamorgan. After many years acting as agent to former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan. He further received an Honorary Fellowship of the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC). As Deputy Chairman of the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (and representative for the Council), he was pivotally instrumental in the redevelopment of the Docks area of Cardiff now known worldwide as Cardiff Bay. Having been vice-chairman of the British Boxing Board of Control between 1999 and 2000, he was its steward since 1986 and its president since 2004. After the former boxer Michael Watson won a negligence case against the BBBoC in 2001, the board had to sell its London headquarters to raise ¬£400,000 to pay compensation. To avoid bankruptcy the board had to reduce its overheads and Brooks was instrumental in moving the board's head office to Cardiff. Brooks was a former chairman of the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame from 1988 and Sportsmatch Wales from 1992. In 1994, he was made a Deputy Lieutenant of South Glamorgan.

In April 2016, WPFB was sold to Sacred Heart Radio, a religious talk radio station based in Norwood, Ohio. On June 3, 2016 WPFB began simulcasting WNOP (AM) alongside WHSS. History Paul F. Braden first signed on WPFB in 1947 as a daytime-only station but a few months later received permission from the Federal Communications Commission to also broadcast in the evening. Throughout much of its history, WPFB had several format switches from middle of the road, country music, adult standards to talk radio, classic country and southern gospel. It established itself as a \\"Real Country\\" format which included Bluegrass and comfortably managed to include the current top hits on the charts. This format ran from the late 1970s to the early 1990s and was nominated for several Country and Bluegrass awards nationally. Several of the DJ's were also popular recording artists. WPFB was also a pioneer of stereo broadcasting, an experimental broadcast occurred with one stereo channel transmitted on WPFB and the other on co-owned WPFB-FM. The station, along with WPFB-FM and WPAY-FM in Portsmouth, Ohio, was purchased in January 2011 by Northern Kentucky University (NKU), the owners of WNKU. WPFB temporarily served as a repeater station of WNKU while NKU searched for a buyer for the AM frequency to help fund the purchase of the two FM stations.WNKU Buys Two Stations to Broaden its Reach In April 2016, Sacred Heart Radio, a religious talk radio station with studios located in Norwood, OH that is affiliated with EWTN Global Catholic Radio, announced that they had acquired WPFB from NKU.

Its founding principles are that spacetime is fundamentally discrete (a collection of discrete spacetime points, called the elements of the causal set) and that spacetime events are related by a partial order. This partial order has the physical meaning of the causality relations between spacetime events. The program is based on a theorem by David Malament that states that if there is a bijective map between two past and future distinguishing space times that preserves their causal structure then the map is a conformal isomorphism. The conformal factor that is left undetermined is related to the volume of regions in the spacetime. This volume factor can be recovered by specifying a volume element for each space time point. The volume of a space time region could then be found by counting the number of points in that region. Causal sets was initiated by Rafael Sorkin who continues to be the main proponent of the program. He has coined the slogan \\"Order + Number = Geometry\\" to characterize the above argument. The program provides a theory in which space time is fundamentally discrete while retaining local Lorentz invariance.  Definition  A causal set (or causet) is a set C with a partial order relation \\\\preceq that is * Reflexive: For all x \\\\in C, we have x \\\\preceq x . * Antisymmetric: For all x, y \\\\in C, we have x \\\\preceq y and y \\\\preceq x implies x = y. * Transitive: For all x, y, z \\\\in C, we have x \\\\preceq y and y \\\\preceq z implies x \\\\preceq z . * Locally finite: For all x, z \\\\in C, we have {y \\\\in C  x \\\\preceq y \\\\preceq z} < \\\\aleph_0. We'll write x \\\\prec y if x \\\\preceq y and x eq y. The set C represents the set of spacetime events and the order relation \\\\preceq represents the causal relationship between events (see causal structure for the analogous idea in a Lorentzian manifold). Although this definition uses the reflexive convention we could have chosen the irreflexive convention in which the order relation is irreflexive. The causal relation of a Lorentzian manifold (without closed causal curves) satisfies the first three conditions. It is the local finiteness condition that introduces spacetime discreteness.  Comparison to the continuum  Given a causal set we may ask whether it can be embedded into a Lorentzian manifold. An embedding would be a map taking elements of the causal set into points in the manifold such that the order relation of the causal set matches the causal ordering of the manifold. A further criterion is needed however before the embedding is suitable. If, on average, the number of causal set elements mapped into a region of the manifold is proportional to the volume of the region then the embedding is said to be faithful. In this case we can consider the causal set to be 'manifold-like' A central conjecture to the causal set program is that the same causal set cannot be faithfully embedded into two spacetimes that are not similar on large scales. This is called the Hauptvermutung, meaning 'fundamental conjecture'. It is difficult to define this conjecture precisely because it is difficult to decide when two spacetimes are 'similar on large scales'. Modelling spacetime as a causal set would require us to restrict attention to those causal sets that are 'manifold-like'. Given a causal set this is a difficult property to determine.  Sprinkling  A plot of 1000 sprinkled points in 1+1 dimensions The difficulty of determining whether a causal set can be embedded into a manifold can be approached from the other direction. We can create a causal set by sprinkling points into a Lorentzian manifold. By sprinkling points in proportion to the volume of the spacetime regions and using the causal order relations in the manifold to induce order relations between the sprinkled points, we can produce a causal set that (by construction) can be faithfully embedded into the manifold. To maintain Lorentz invariance this sprinkling of points must be done randomly using a Poisson process. Thus the probability of sprinkling n points into a region of volume V is P(n) = \\\\frac{(\\\\rho V)^n e^{-\\\\rho V}}{n!} where \\\\rho is the density of the sprinkling. Sprinkling points as a regular lattice would not keep the number of points proportional to the region volume.  Geometry  Some geometrical constructions in manifolds carry over to causal sets. When defining these we must remember to rely only on the causal set itself, not on any background spacetime into which it might be embedded. For an overview of these constructions, see.  Geodesics  A plot of geodesics between two points in a 180-point causal set made by sprinkling into 1+1 dimensions A link in a causal set is a pair of elements x, y \\\\in C such that x \\\\prec y but with no z \\\\in C such that x \\\\prec z \\\\prec y. A chain is a sequence of elements x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n such that x_i \\\\prec x_{i+1} for i=0,\\\\ldots,n-1. The length of a chain is n. If every x_i, x_{i+1} in the chain form a link, then the chain is called a path. We can use this to define the notion of a geodesic between two causal set elements, provided they are order comparable, that is, causally connected (physically, this means they are time-like). A geodesic between two elements x \\\\preceq y \\\\in C is a chain consisting only of links such that # x_0 = x and x_n = y # The length of the chain, n, is maximal over all chains from x to y. In general there can be more than one geodesic between two comparable elements. MyrheimJ. Myrheim, CERN preprint TH-2538 (1978) first suggested that the length of such a geodesic should be directly proportional to the proper time along a timelike geodesic joining the two spacetime points. Tests of this conjecture have been made using causal sets generated from sprinklings into flat spacetimes. The proportionality has been shown to hold and is conjectured to hold for sprinklings in curved spacetimes too.  Dimension estimators  Much work has been done in estimating the manifold dimension of a causal set. This involves algorithms using the causal set aiming to give the dimension of the manifold into which it can be faithfully embedded. The algorithms developed so far are based on finding the dimension of a Minkowski spacetime into which the causal set can be faithfully embedded. *Myrheim-Meyer dimension This approach relies on estimating the number of k-length chains present in a sprinkling into d-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Counting the number of k-length chains in the causal set then allows an estimate for d to be made. *Midpoint-scaling dimension This approach relies on the relationship between the proper time between two points in Minkowski spacetime and the volume of the spacetime interval between them. By computing the maximal chain length (to estimate the proper time) between two points x and y and counting the number of elements z such that x \\\\prec z \\\\prec y (to estimate the volume of the spacetime interval) the dimension of the spacetime can be calculated. These estimators should give the correct dimension for causal sets generated by high-density sprinklings into d-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Tests in conformally-flat spacetimes have shown these two methods to be accurate.  Dynamics  An ongoing task is to develop the correct dynamics for causal sets. These would provide a set of rules that determine which causal sets correspond to physically realistic spacetimes. The most popular approach to developing causal set dynamics is based on the sum-over-histories version of quantum mechanics. This approach would perform a \\"sum-over-causal sets\\" by growing a causal set one element at a time. Elements would be added according to quantum mechanical rules and interference would ensure a large manifold-like spacetime would dominate the contributions. The best model for dynamics at the moment is a classical model in which elements are added according to probabilities. This model, due to David Rideout and Rafael Sorkin, is known as classical sequential growth (CSG) dynamics. The classical sequential growth model is a way to generate causal sets by adding new elements one after another. Rules for how new elements are added are specified and, depending on the parameters in the model, different causal sets result. In analogy to the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, one approach to developing a quantum dynamics for causal sets has been to apply an action principle in the sum-over-causal sets approach. Sorkin has proposed a discrete analogue for the d'Alembertian, which can in turn be used to define the Ricci curvature scalar and thereby the Benincasa-Dowker action on a causal set. Monte-Carlo simulations have provided evidence for a continuum phase in 2D using the Benincasa-Dowker Action.

Norman Davies, in the context of Polish nationalism, generally defined nationalism as \\"a doctrine ... to create a nation by arousing people's awareness of their nationality, and to mobilize their feelings into a vehicle for political action\\". The old Polish proto-nationalism of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth which was based on its population's Polish-Lithuanian identity was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, though ethnic Poles still constituted the majority of the population and Roman Catholicism was still the most dominant religion inside the nation. The nationalist ideology which developed soon after the Partitions was initially free of any kind of \\"ethnic nationalism.\\" It was a Romantic movement which sought the restoration of the Polish sovereign state. Polish Romantic nationalism was described by Maurycy Mochnacki as \\"the essence of the nation\\" no longer defined by borders but by ideas, feelings, and thoughts resulting from the past. The birth of modern nationalism under foreign rule coincided with the November Uprising of 1830 and the subsequent Spring of Nations. However, the defeat suffered by the Poles also broke the Polish revolutionary spirit. Many intellectuals turned to social Darwinism of Herbert Spencer, blaming the Romantic philosophy for the loss of their property, mass destruction, and ultimately the loss of the nation. With the advent of Positivism between 1860 and 1890 Polish nationalism became an elitist cause. Because the partitioning powers could not have identified themselves with the Polish nation, the ideology became more restrictive in terms of ethnicity and religion. History The earliest manifestations of Polish nationalism, and conscious discussions of what it means to be a citizen of the Polish nation, can be traced back to the 17th or 18th centuries, with some scholars going as far back as the 13th century. Early Polish nationalism, or protonationalism, was related to the Polish- Lithuanian identity, represented primarily by the Polish nobility (szlachta), and their cultural values (such as the Golden Freedoms and Sarmatism). It was founded on civic, republican ideas. This early form of Polish nationalism begun to fray and transform with the destruction of the Polish state in the late 18th century partitions of Poland. Modern Polish nationalism arose as a movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries amongst Polish activists who promoted a Polish national consciousness while rejecting cultural assimilation into the dominant cultures of Austria, Prussia and Russia, the three empires which partitioned and conquered the regions of Poland which they then resided in. This was the consequence of Polish statelessness, because the Polish nationality was suppressed by the authorities of the countries which acquired the territory of the former Commonwealth. It was during that time that Polishness begun to be identified with ethnicity, increasingly excluding groups such as the Polish Jews, who were previously more likely to be accepted as Polish patriots. This was also the period in which Polish nationalism, which was previously common to both left-wing and right-wing political platforms, became more redefined as being limited to the right-wing, with the appearance of politician Roman Dmowski who renamed Liga Polska (the Polish League) as Liga Narodowa (the National League) in 1893. Polish nationalism reached its heights in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Its crucial waves followed the Polish defeat in the January Uprising of 1864, the restoration of an independent Polish state in 1918 and the establishment of a homogenous ethnic Polish state in 1945. An important element of Polish nationalism has been its identification with the Roman Catholic religion, though this is a relatively recent development, with its roots in the counter-reformation of the 17th century, and one which became clearly established in the interwar period. Although the old Commonwealth was religiously diverse and highly tolerant, the Roman Catholic religious narrative with messianic undertones (the Christ of Nations) became one of the defining characteristics of the modern Polish identity. Roman Dmowski, a Polish politician of that era, was vital in defining that concept, and has been called the \\"father of Polish nationalism.\\" The post-World War II human migrations, with the resultant demographic and territorial changes of Poland that drastically reduced the number of ethnic minorities in Poland, also played a major role in the creation of the modern Polish state and nationality. In communist Poland the regime adopted, modified and used for its official ideology and propaganda some of the nationalist concepts developed by Dmowski. As Dmowski's National Democrats strongly believed in a \\"national\\" (ethnically homogenous) state, even if this criterion necessitated a reduced territory, their territorial and ethnic ideas were accepted and practically implemented by the Polish communists, acting with Joseph Stalin's permission. Stalin himself in 1944-45 conferenced with and was influenced by a leading National Democrat Stanis≈Çaw Grabski, coauthor of the planned border and population shifts and an embodiment of the nationalist-communist collusion. Polish nationalism, together with pro-American liberalism, played an important part in the development of Solidarity in the 1980s. In current Polish politics, Polish nationalism is most openly represented by parties that are part of the Liberty and Independence Confederation coalition. As of 2020, the coalition, composed of several smaller parties, has 11 deputies in the Polish parliament.

Licensed to Middletown, Ohio, United States, the station serves the Cincinnati and Dayton areas. The station is currently owned by Grant County Broadcasters, Inc. History WPFB-FM first signed on in 1959. WPFB-FM was the first FM station in Ohio and the 13th in the United States to broadcast in stereo. Like its AM sister WPFB (AM), WPFB-FM had several format changes over the years. It was a soul gospel music format in the late 1970s. In the early 80's the station switched to Disco calling themselves \\"Disco 106\\" after changing the call letters to WPBF. That only lasted a few years. Alan Matthews was hired as program director and flipped the format to soft adult contemporary as WPBF \\"Mellow 106.\\" in the latter part of 1984 they gave up the AC format and tried CHR, calling the station Rock 106. That only lasted for a few weeks, due to the confusion with AOR/CHR 96 Rock who's city of licence was only 10 miles away from Middletown. Keeping the CHR format they added the word \\"New\\" to calling it New Rock 106, PBF-FM. Timing was not to their advantage because a few months later WGTZ Z-93 debuted commercial free with a much stronger signal into Dayton. In 1986 the format was changed southern gospel in and bluegrass music in 1988 when the calls were switched back to WPFB-FM. Over a 2-year period the station blended bluegrass and traditional country before renaming the station to The Rebel in 1988 where it maintained a country music format until the sale to Northern Kentucky University in 2011. Switch to Public Radio Beginning on February 1, 2011; WPFB-FM, along with its then- sister station WPAY-FM in Portsmouth, Ohio, began simulcasting the signal of Northern Kentucky University-owned WNKU. At that time, WPFB and WPAY switched from a country format to an adult album alternative (AAA) format.WNKU Buys Two Stations to Broaden it's Reach The sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on June 20, 2011 and the station officially changed their call letters to WNKN on that date. In June 2016, former sister station WPFB (AM) became a simulcast of Sacred Heart Radio stations WNOP (AM) and WHSS. 2017 sale and return to private ownership In April 2016, citing state budget cuts to education, Northern Kentucky University announced that it would \\"explore the possibility of a sale of WNKU-FM and its assets.\\" http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/04/06/nku-considers-selling-wnku- radio-station/82694768/ On February 14, 2017, the NKU Board of Trustees voted to approve the sale of WNKU's license and transmitter site to the Bible Broadcasting Network for $1.9 million. In addition, the WNKE repeater was sold to the Educational Media Foundation for $750,000 plus 75% of the net sale proceeds of EMF-owned affiliate WEKV in South Webster, Ohio.

The comic is serialized in the Thai version of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, C-Kids. Introduction The neo universe is the most popular MMO RPG right now, in which players get a great gaming experience with technology that can take their minds into the game with headphones that will Releasing soft electrical waves Which is guaranteed by many leading companies The story focuses on the war between the game-masters (GM) group and the anti-game- masters group, to which Ganda, a boy protagonist belongs. The story also touches on how Ganda and his friends are doing and their relationship in the real world. Unlike other online games in which players are separated into different servers, Neo-Universe keeps all 7,000,000 players in one server. In the game, there are four planets on which the players live: * Laputa: The planet on which Ganda and his friends; the story takes place primarily here * Vertex: A mysterious planet, full of monsters and dangers * Reticulum: The planet with the largest trading and marketing area * Muera: The planet with abundant ores, and with more-advanced technology compared with the other planets  Plot  Ganda, a young secondary-school teenage, who got a popular Neo Universe game from his brother, Vissana. Having participated in the game, hoping to become a GM like his brother. However, Ganda was tricked by an Anti- GM member named Waipoj, and became one of the Anti-GM members. He learned later that the Anti-GMs were not evil as he thought. The real evil were the rebellious GM members (which his brother are part of) who betraying and destroying they former group and use they power as they own free will. Since they could kill any player for their own purposes. The Anti-GM group was the only group brave enough to challenge them, and it became an army with the addition of allies. Ganda, now assigned as Captain of 1st Anti-GM army division, have been adventuring in this VR world, doing the assigned missions, making new friends in the game, leading into become part of a war between two faction.  Characters = Anti-GM Army members  ;Ganda: *Age: 18 *Class/Occupation: Randomizer/High-school student *ESP Hyper-reaction: Due to his ESP Ganda has greater flexibility than most players, which means he can dodge dangers quicker than they. However, it is unrelated to his speed parameter. Therefore, Ganda is not faster than normal players with the same speed status; he just has a quicker response. *First appearance: Chapter one Ganda is the protagonist of EXEcutional. His initial goal was to become a Game Master like his elder brother Vissana (), but a bizarre encounter with Waipoj makes him leader of the first division of the anti-GM faction. He is energetic, optimistic and full of willpower, making him a likeable figure within the anti-GM army. Throughout his time as commander Ganda has shown great skill in battle (which he owes to his class ability), and has gained the respect of other members of the army. In the real world Ganda studies at Passorn's school, and is in his second year of high school. He lives alone, with his brother absent most of the time. Behind his house is a haunted banana forest, and Ganda had several comical encounters with ghosts when other characters are sleeping over. *Skills: His ability as a Randomizer grants him the power to summon weapons, spells and items at random. These summonses can range from powerful to useless, or damaging to the user. As Ganda climbs the levels he gains new abilities, which allow him to use more than weapons. His abilities also stabilize, becoming less random: *Miracle Treasure Box: Ganda's default skill, he summons a treasure box to obtain random weapons. *Star Treasure Box: Ganda summons a Star Treasure box: a slot machine, which he plays to randomly receive status bonuses or penalties (for example, a free speed boost a poisoning). *Rainbow Treasure Box: Ganda summons a Rainbow Treasure box, in which he has to match cards within a time limit. Depending on the pairs he gets, Ganda can cast a variety of spells. The name \\"Ganda\\" literally means \\"beautiful young lady\\", and is supposed to be a girl's name; the author may have chosen this name ironically. ;Passorn: *Age: 17 *Job (In game/Real life): First job: ranger; second job; guardian/High-school student (Ganda's classmate) *First appearance: Beginning of volume one Passorn is a cheerful, lively girl, a member of the first unit. She is Ganda's assistant when he joins the army, and uses a long gun skillfully. In the real world, she is a shy girl who is in love with Ganda. She never shows her feelings; she blushes when Ganda is around, and all she can do is look at Ganda from behind him in the classroom. The picture in the infobox shows Passorn above in the game and below in the real world. ;Waipoj: *Age: 18 *Job (in game/real-world): Biologist/College student *First appearance: Beginning of volume one A wily boy, who lured Ganda to become the first-division captain of the anti-GM army. He is creative, full of strange ideas but good nevertheless. His skill is genetic engineering, creating a new monster to support him in battle by mixing genes from other monsters. He has many monster cards, and when he throws out some of his cards the monsters on the card undergo a fusion reaction to become a new monster (for example, an evil eye, turtle shell, and iron dumbbell become an iron evil eye). After defeating Ghost Master (chief monster in the Winchester house dungeon), he returns to the anti-GM army. ;Monsters: *\\"Rolling Hawkeye\\": a massive mace-liked ball. *\\"Slime Bunker\\": a well- protected slime wall. *\\"Ultra Rolling\\": a huge size of Rolling Hawkeye. *\\"Crab Destroyer\\": a miniguns pincers crab *\\"Royal Queen Lotus Smasher\\": an enormous sharptooth lotus. *\\"Aiming Flower\\": an eagle-eyed flower. *\\"Dragon Vine\\": a giant dragon-faced vine. *\\"Calamity Hand\\": a metal hand enforced with powerful laser beam. *\\"Varient Tank\\": a new version of Boss Varient, containing guns and missile. ;Wiriya: *Age: 14 *Job (in game/real-world): General/Secondary- school student *First appearance: Beginning of volume one A muscled rabbit, who also is in the first unit. What everyone does not know is that Mr. Rabbit is really a woman; she is the army's advisor. She seems to like Ganda; whenever she meets him, she greets him with a tight hug. When she improves her class, her name changes to Hero. She uses a spear (a rare item) skillfully, and is a secondary-school student like Kasem, Nanthagorn and Majsha. She is close friends with Majsha (the chief), both in the real world and in the game, but she seems to also owe Majsha something. ;Assada: *Age: 19 *Job (in game/real-world): First job: Berserker; second job: Highlander/College Student *First appearance: End of volume one Assada is the captain of the second division. He is quiet, and his face does not show much emotion; according to Passorn, he is very shy. His fort√© are sword tricks. Because of his great battle ability he is respected by everyone in the army (especially his vice- captain, Kasem). Assada was defeated in a conflict with a GM; after a temporary withdrawal from the anti-GMs and a training stint in the Winchester Maze Dungeon, he returns during the Winchester War and defeated a GM. ;Kasem: *Age: 14 *Job (in game/real-world): Fighter/Secondary-school student *First appearance: End of volume one Assada's vice-captain despite his childishness and hot temper, Kasem is a member of the second unit whose skill is bare- knuckle fighting. Invited to join the army by Assada, Kasem once said that he entered the army because he wanted to live near a person he liked. He is possibly bisexual, always seen near Assada wherever he goes. He is also fond of Passorn, however, although he knows she loves Ganda. In the real world, Kasem is very short (148 cm‚Äîfour feet eleven inches tall). He attends school with Majsha, Nanthagorn and Wiriya. ;Majsha: *Age: 14 *Job (In game/Real- life): Key Master/Middle-school student *ESP genius: There have been only a few true geniuses, and Majsha is not one of them. However, she is superior to girls her age and to most adults. *First appearance: Beginning of volume three Leader of the anti-GM army despite her young age, Majsha is their smartest and strongest member. She is a gifted strategist, and an exceptional leader. Her name means \\"fish\\" in Thai. In the first few chapters of the comic, she does not show her face when communicating with the other members; instead, the picture of a goldfish is used as her avatar. In the real world Majsha studies with Wiriya, Nanthagorn and Kasem, and declares her love for Ganda. As one of the twelve Key Masters, her event-horizon weapon is the Justice Ray. ;Nanthagorn: *Age: 14 *Job (In game/Real-life): Monster/Middle-school student *First appearance: Episode seven Appearing to Ganda as a duck, Nanthagorn says he is a monster controlled by a player but in reality he can change from human to duck at will. He does not get along with Ganda, and competes with him in the army. In real life he studies with Kasem and Wiriya (whom he calls \\"Fried tofu\\"). Wiriya does not like Nanthagorn because she knows that he likes her best friend, Majsha. Kasem is his best friend. *Skills: He use bazooka (or cannon), bombs and wooden signs (for communicating with others and melee fighting) as his weapon. *Soul Steal: he can steal monster souls, which make him able to use owner soul's abilities. *Transform: he can transform himself into duck form, that have more stamina. And human form, that more speed.  Game Master (GM)  Neo Universe differs from other massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) in what a GM can or cannot do. GMs of Neo Universe can do whatever they please, as long as it does not violate the rules. As a result, GMs can abuse their power for their benefit. ; Ruler of the World: The Ruler of the World is a program that keeps Neo Universe running; the \\"Creator\\" left instructions. ;Lettuce: Lettuce is a GM with long blond hair who wears a coat and specializes in using fields created from his weapon. Lettuce fought and killed Assada the first time they met; however, Ganda killed him in the Winchester War. His weapon is the Force of the Century, a device similar to a Nintendo Famicom. Lettuce inserts cartridges into his Force of the Century, creating fields corresponding to each cartridge from which he will gain abilities. For example, the Bomber Cartridge creates a Bomberman-like maze, and Lettuce can use bombs to attack his opponent. These fields can stack; as the battle continues, Lettuce becomes stronger. His strongest weapon can inflict damage valued at 24,000 (24 K). When Lettuce uses his skills, the pupils of his eyes become invisible. ;Onion: Onion always wears a cap and eye scope; his weapon is called the Violence Killer. There are two weapons in a set: a flashlight and chopsticks. His flashlight (unlike an ordinary flashlight) produces a dark light to blind his enemies and while his opponent cannot see, Onion will destroy his opponent's weapon with the chopsticks. ;Tomato: Tomato is bald, and wears two pairs of glasses: one on his eyes and one on his forehead. He is sadistic, and likes to kill people in the game; he enjoys seeing his opponent's blood and hearing them scream. His weapon, Chainsaw Massacre, is a three-bladed chainsaw. When Tomato takes off his glasses, he becomes more powerful. His death-blow is a power wave with gravity force; opponents cannot evade it unless they have a high-speed move or warp skill. ;Lemon: Lemon is an old man with glasses. He is a skilled inventor in the GM group and invented the GMs' transportation, the spaceship Nexus. Lemon always carries a backpack filled with construction blueprints. ;Pumpkin: Pumpkin is tricky and full of guile, a classmate of Assada in the real world. In the game, he likes to fool the opponents into thinking they are all on the same side. When the opponent's defenses are down, he moves in. His weapon is Raging Pain (a whip). Pumpkin's appearance and personality are similar to Ichimaru Gin in Bleach. ;Carrot: Carrot specializes in magic and is an expert on star magic, which is the rarest and most powerful kind of magic. His older sister is married to Holy Order in the real world. His weapon, Star Bridge, prevents Carrot's spells from being canceled. All damage received during casting, and the knock-back effects from attacks received, will be nullified. His skill is with the Quazar, which sends opponents to the center of the universe where they are killed; since their bodies are far away, it is difficult to resurrect them. ;Broccoli: Broccoli is a GM who looks like a boy wearing a lion costume. He acts like a young boy, showing emotion directly, wanting someone to cheer or comfort him and talking a lot. He encountered Majsha in the pass and was almost defeated by her, resulting in his fear of the Justice Ray. His weapon is Spartan X: a small knife whose attack power varies according to how much force Broccoli puts into it. ;Holy Order: The master GM, Holy Order appears as a middle-aged man with short blond hair. He seems to enjoy mentally dueling with Majsha. He is relaxed, but can turn serious when needed. His weapon is the Creature Master, which has a touch screen, clam-shell design and a stylus. Holy Order has no offensive skills, only has support ones used through Creature Master (by drawing skill-signs on its screen). His skills include Sacrifice Vision (a risky healing skill) and Chain Vision (which joins attacks). Other Characters ;Mint: *First appearance: Middle of volume three Mint's job is a monster dealer, being able to buy items from monsters; the items she gets from monsters are always cheaper than market price (and sometimes rare). She is skilled at fast calculations, and becomes a successful investor; she and Ganda invest in the Eric Herb Company. Mint was tricked into joining the GM force after the Winchester War with her code name, GM Mint, and was defeated by Majsha. ;Eric Herb Company: *First Appearance: Middle of volume three Eric Herb Company sells herbs which can increase life points or battle ability. The company's owner is Kan, a sharp-tongued businesswoman accompanied by three boys her age: Kitti (an angry-faced farmer), Ei (a cocky-faced plant researcher) and Samart (a sleepy-faced surveyor). ;Browser: *First appearance: Beginning of the story A bully, who likes to tease weaker players; his first (and last) appearance is in chapter one, where Ganda and Waipoj teach him a lesson. ;Merchant Committee and Barbarian Group: *First Appearance: Middle of volume one The leader of the merchant committee is an intimidating man, approximately tall and accompanied by two similar-looking characters. His skills are \\"Shop remote\\" (a skill forcing a weaker player to buy him a common item at a high price) and \\"Shop remote arrange\\" (forcing a weaker player to sell him their own (possibly rare) item for a low price. His deathblow is \\"Shop fusion\\" (making a battle tank with an accomplice). The Barbarian Group is another belligerent group of merchants appearing in volume one. They have a conflict with the merchant committee, which is invading their trading area. They fight and, with the help of Ganda and his friend, win the battle and get their area back.

They were a part of a global movement of workers to parts of East Africa, to help build infrastructure projects, establish services, retail markets and for administrative support. The immigrants, some educated and skilled but mostly poor and struggling in famine prone areas of Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal, helped construct the first railway line between Malawi and Mozambique. Hinduism has a very small minority presence in predominantly Christian Malawi. The government tracks Christian and Muslim demographics, but does not recognize other religions separately, considers Hindus as well as the traditional African religions as a part of the \\"Others\\" category. The \\"Others\\" were about 3.1% in 2006.International Religious Freedom Report 2006, Malawi, State Department of the United StatesMalawi IFPRI According to the 1994 constitution of Malawi, many seats in its Senate are reserved for \\"major religious faiths of Malawi\\", and only Christianity and Islam is recognized as \\"major faiths\\". Malawi thus constitutionally bars people with faiths such as Hinduism from political representation in its Senate, allows only Christians and Muslims to hold the set aside seats of political power. After colonialism ended, Hindus (along with Jains and Sikhs) were discriminated against in East Africa, where various East African governments promoted Africanization enacting laws and policies that required commercial and professional sectors of the economy to be owned by non-Europeans, non-Asians, and only indigenous Africans. Many Hindus previously residing in Malawi migrated to other countries during this period, particularly the United Kingdom starting with the 1960s.

He currently teaches environmental studies at the University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney), Australia. He was formerly professor of environmental science and founding director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney and before that a principal research scientist with CSIRO, where he was involved in early research on integrating wind power into electricity grids. His most recent book is Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change.  Biography  Diesendorf is the son of the engineer Walter Diesendorf and the poet Margaret Diesendorf. His PhD research was focused on applied mathematics and theoretical physics applied to the solar interior. His early postdoctoral research was diverse, including the analysis of ground and satellite data on VLF emissions, mechanisms of insect smell and vision, and biological catalysts. From 1975 to 1985 he worked in the CSIRO Division of Mathematics & Statistics, the Australian national research organisation, on topics such as the integration of wind power into electricity grids.Diesendorf M.

From 1996 to 2001 he was Professor of Environmental Science and Founding Director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at UTS and then director of a company Sustainability Centre Pty Ltd. From 2004 to 2016, Diesendorf has been a Senior Lecturer and then Associate Professor and Deputy Director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of NSW, now called UNSW Australia. In 2015 IES was abolished by the university and Diesendorf retired (nominally) in mid-2016 to become Honorary Associate Professor at UNSW. He continues to teach (as a guest lecturer), research and consult in the interdisciplinary fields of sustainable energy, sustainable urban transport, theory of sustainability, ecological economics, and practical processes by which government, business and other organisations can achieve ecologically sustainable and socially just development.UNSW Institute of Environmental Studies Based on his belief that science, technology and economics should serve the community at large, Dr Diesendorf has been at various times the Secretary of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science (Australian Capital Territory), President of the Australia New Zealand Society for Ecological Economics, co-founder and Vice-President of the Sustainable Energy Industries Council of Australia, and co-founder and President of the original Australasian Wind Energy Association. Much of his recent and current research is on climate mitigation, especially transitioning electricity supply systems to 100% renewable energy. To this end he is involved with colleagues in the Centre for Energy & Environmental Markets at UNSW in scenario development, computer simulation modelling and energy policy.

Basel IA would have been more risk sensitive than Basel I but would not be as complex as the advanced approach under Basel II. On July 20, 2007 by a deal between the various US banking regulators (The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) it was decided to drop the proposed Basel IA and allow Basel II Standardised in its place. The US initially proposed that banks would need to use the advanced approach only if they were to implement Basel II. The idea of Basel IA was to enable smaller US banks to adopt a methodology that is more risk sensitive than Basel I that they are currently using for calculating capital adequacy. The Fed chairman mentioned that smaller banks who do not wish to move to Basel II Advanced or Basel IA could continue to operate under Basel I.

He was awarded 23 caps for Wales and captained his country eight times. Davey was a hard tackling centre and his most famous performance took place on 21 December 1935 when he led Wales to a historic 13-12 victory over the All Blacks at Cardiff. Early career Davey was one of the outstanding Welsh players of his generation, known for his impressive crash-tackling and strong running ability.Thomas (1979), pg 81. He was often criticised for poor handling, but Davey tended to run onto the ball at speed requiring not only good timing but good passing from his team mates. When it failed it was classed as 'bad hands' but when it worked Davey would make distinct attacking headway. This style of play was described in 1930 by the Llanelly Mercury as 'he can do nothing except emulate a battering ram, and too often he forgets to take the ball with him'.Smith (1980), pg 255. Davey first came to notice while playing for the Wales Secondary Schools, before gaining a place for a Wales University XV, while he was studying electrical engineering at Swansea University. His first club team, was 'the Mond'Cwmgors RFC - A History a colliery team that would later become Cwmgors, moving to Swansea in 1928. His first game for Swansea came in December of the same year against Skewen. International rugby Davey was called up for Wales at the end of the 1929/30 season in the final game of the tournament against France. In an extremely rough match Davey made a very good impression. He was called upon again the next season, though at this time he was playing for Sale. Davey made a name for himself in the 1931 game against Ireland in Belfast. Ireland only need to beat Wales to win the Triple Crown, but Davey and Jack Bassett tackled with such brutal aggression that the opposite centre retired with concussion and his replacement was later knocked unconscious. Davey not only subdued the Irish on their own soil but also scored a try himself and put his wing in for two more.Thomas (1979), pg 82. He first captained Wales against Scotland in 1934, and would captain his nation a further seven times.

Coiled tubing reels Coiled Tubing Unit (CTU) In the oil and gas industries, coiled tubing refers to a very long metal pipe, normally in diameter which is supplied spooled on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. Coiled tubing is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of jointed pipe. For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a coiled tubing operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where coiled tubing can be performed and make the operation more costly. A coiled tubing operation is normally performed through the drilling derrick on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For coiled tubing operations on sub-sea wells a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for light operations a mobile self- contained coiled tubing rig can be used. The tool string at the bottom of the coil is often called the bottom hole assembly (BHA). It can range from something as simple as a jetting nozzle, for jobs involving pumping chemicals or cement through the coil, to a larger string of logging tools, depending on the operations. Coiled tubing has also been used as a cheaper version of work- over operations. It is used to perform open hole drilling and milling operations. Common coiled tubing steels have yield strengths ranging from 55,000 PSI to 120,000 PSI so it can also be used to fracture the reservoir, a process where fluid is pressurized to thousands of psi on a specific point in a well to break the rock apart and allow the flow of product. Coil tubing can perform almost any operation for oil well operations if used correctly.  Uses =Circulation The most typical use for coiled tubing is circulation or deliquification. A hydrostatic head (a column of fluid in the well bore) may be inhibiting flow of formation fluids because of its weight (the well is said to have been killed). The safest (though not the cheapest) solution would be to attempt to circulate out the fluid, using a gas, frequently nitrogen (Often called a 'Nitrogen Kick'). By running coiled tubing into the bottom of the hole and pumping in the gas, the kill fluid can be forced out to production. Circulating can also be used to clean out light debris, which may have accumulated in the hole. Coiled tubing umbilicals can convey hydraulic submersible pumps and jet pumps into wells. These pumps allow for inexpensive and noninvasive well cleanouts on low-pressure CBM (coal bed methane) gas wells. These umbilicals can also be run into deviated wells and horizontal laterals. Pumping Pumping through coiled tubing can also be used for dispersing fluids to a specific location in the well such as for cementing perforations or performing chemical washes of downhole components such as sandscreens. In the former case, coiled tubing is particularly advantageous compared to simply pumping the cement from surface as allowing it to flow through the entire completion could potentially damage important components, such as the downhole safety valve. Coiled tubing umbilical technologies enable the deployment of complex pumps which require multiple fluid strings on coiled tubing. In many cases, the use of coiled tubing to deploy a complex pump can greatly reduce the cost of deployment by eliminating the number of units on site during the deploy. Coiled Tubing Drilling A relatively modern drilling technique involves using coiled tubing instead of conventional drill pipe. This has the advantage of requiring less effort to trip in and out of the well (the coil can simply be run in and pulled out while drill pipe must be assembled and dismantled joint by joint while tripping in and out). An additional advantage is that the coiled tubing enters the hole via a stripper, mounted on the injector, which provides a hydraulic seal around the coil. This offers well control capabilities beyond those normally possible with drill pipe, and gives the ability to drill underbalanced. Instead of rotating the drill bit by using a rotary table or top drive at the surface, it is turned by a downhole MUD MOTOR, powered by the motion of drilling fluid pumped from surface. Drilling which is powered by a mud motor instead of a rotating pipe is generally called slide drilling. Typically the mud motor will be one component of a Coiled Tubing Drilling bottom hole assembly. The BHA also provides directional survey, gamma, pressure, temperature, and in some cases, petrophysical logs as drilling progresses. The latest generation of advanced Coiled tubing drilling BHAs offer the ability to steer the bit,, AnTech, Directional Coiled Tubing Drilling Bottom Hole Assembly, 2014, Retrieved 25 July 2014 enabling the well's trajectory to be corrected in response to the measurements taken by the sensors. Logging and perforating These tasks are by default the realm of wireline. Because coiled tubing is rigid, it can be pushed into the well from the surface. This is an advantage over wireline, which depends on the weight of the toolstring to be lowered into the well. For highly deviated and horizontal wells, gravity may be insufficient for wireline logging. Roller stem and tractors can often overcome this disadvantage at greatly reduced cost, particularly on small platforms and subsea wells where coiled tubing would require mobilizing an expensive mobile drilling rig. The use of coiled tubing for these tasks is usually confined to occasions where it is already on site for another purpose, for example a logging run following a chemical wash. Production Coiled tubing is often used as a production string in shallow gas wells that produce some water. The narrow internal diameter results in a much higher velocity than would occur inside conventional tubing or inside the casing. This higher velocity assists in lifting liquids to surface, liquids which might otherwise accumulate in the wellbore and eventually \\"kill\\" the well. The coiled tubing may be run inside the casing instead or inside conventional tubing. When coiled tubing is run inside of conventional tubing it is often referred to as a \\"velocity string\\" and the space between the outside of the coiled tubing and the inside of the conventional tubing is referred to as the \\"micro annulus\\". In some cases gas is produced up into the micro annulus. Coiled tubing umbilicals can convey hydraulic submersible pumps, electric submersible pumps and jet pumps into wells for both permanent deliquification schemes and service applications. Coiled tubing rigup The main engine of a coiled tubing intervention is the injector head. This component contains the mechanism to push and pull the coil in and out of the hole. An injector head has a curved guide beam on top called a gooseneck which threads the coil into the injector body. Below the injector is the stripper, which contains rubber pack off elements providing a seal around the tubing to isolate the well's pressure. Below the stripper is the preventer, which provides the ability to cut the coiled tubing pipe and seal the well bore (shear-blind) and hold and seal around the pipe (pipe-slip). Older quad-BOPs have a different ram for each of these functions (blind, shear, pipe, slip). Newer dual-BOPs combine some of these functions together to need just two distinct rams (shear-blind, pipe-slip). The BOP sits below the riser, which provides the pressurized tunnel down to the top of the Christmas tree. Between the Christmas tree and the riser is the final pressure barrier, the shear-seal BOP, which can cut and seal the pipe. Worldwide the coiled tubing unit count has increased year on year in the past decade especially in the USA., CTD Rig Unit Count, Drilling Contractor,Retrieved 23 July 2014 Onshore light coiled tubing unit A coiled tubing unit (CTU) is a self-contained multi-use machine that can do almost anything that a conventional service rig does - with the exception of tripping jointed pipe. There are generally two types in shallow service - Arch and Picker. One uses a vertical elevator with a horsehead on top, and an injector hanging by winch line off it. The Picker units have a picker, and a horsehead bolted directly to the injector. These type of coiled tubing units have a semi-permanent drum mounted amidships (They are generally tandem drive Class 3 trucks, long or so)  Coiled Tubing Parts  Custom/generic coiled tubing gripper blocks, skate rollers, arch rollers  UVG - Universal Gripper Block  Most gripper blocks, which hold the tubing while pushing or pulling in / out the well are \\"size on size\\" meaning they fit the tubing exactly. There is another gripper block that will accommodate various sizes without changing the gripper block. This is often referred to as a \\"V Block\\" which was first developed by Otis Engineering. This provides tubing of varying sizes to be used without changing the gripper blocks. These blocks provide superior gripping with less force (as per patent). The advantage of this is less hydraulic pressure and less stress on skate rollers and backing plates increasing the life of the equipment.

This means that the relationship must be true as long as all variables are measured properly.\\" The term accounting identity may be used to distinguish between propositions that are theories (which may or may not be true, or relationships that may or may not always hold) and statements that are by definition true. Despite the fact that the statements are by definition true, the underlying figures as measured or estimated may not add up due to measurement error, particularly for certain identities in macroeconomics.See, for example, Suranovic, \\"International Finance Theory and Policy\\": \\"In practice, this identity rarely adds up, however, because the variables are not typically measured accurately.\\" Description The most basic identity in accounting is that the balance sheet must balance, that is, that assets must equal the sum of liabilities (debts) and equity (the value of the firm to the owner). In its most common formulation it is known as the accounting equation: :Assets = Liabilities + Equity where debt includes non-financial liabilities. Balance sheets are commonly presented as two parallel columns, each summing to the same total, with the assets on the left, and liabilities and owners' equity on the right. The parallel columns of Assets and Equities are, in effect, two views of the same set of business facts. The balance of the balance sheet reflects the conventions of double-entry bookkeeping, by which business transactions are recorded. In double-entry bookkeeping, every transaction is recorded by paired entries, and typically a transaction will result in two or more pairs of entries. The sale of product, for example, would record both a receipt of cash (or the creation of a trade receivable in the case of an extension of credit to the buyer) and a reduction in the inventory of goods for sale; the receipt of cash or a trade receivable is an addition to revenue, and the reduction in goods inventory is an addition to expense. In this case, an \\"expense\\" is the \\"expending\\" of an asset. Thus, there are two pairs of entries: an addition to revenue balanced by an addition to cash; a subtraction from inventory balanced by an addition to expense. The cash and inventory accounts are asset accounts; the revenue and expense accounts will close at the end of the accounting period to affect equity. Double-entry bookkeeping conventions are employed as well for the National Accounts. Economic concepts such as national product, aggregate income, investment and savings, as well as the balance of payments and balance of trade, involve accounting identities. The application of double-entry bookkeeping conventions in measuring aggregate economic activity derives from the recognition that: every purchase is also a sale, every payment made translates income received, and every act of lending also an act of borrowing. Here the term identity is a mathematical identity or a logical tautology, since it defines an equivalence which does not depend on the particular values of the variables. Identities in accounting Accounting has a number of identities in common usage, and since many identities can be decomposed into others, no comprehensive listing is possible. Inter-period identities Accounting identities also apply between accounting periods, such as changes in cash balances. For example: :Cash at beginning of period + Changes in cash during period = Cash at end of period\\"Money, Banking, and Financial Institutions\\", Siklos, p. 175, 2006 Value of an asset Any asset recorded in a firm's balance sheet will have a carrying value. By definition, the carrying value must equal the historic cost (or acquisition cost) of the asset, plus (or minus) any subsequent adjustments in the value of the asset, such as depreciation. :Carrying value = Historic cost + Change in value Economics In economics, there are numerous accounting identities. Balance of payments One of the most commonly known is the balance of payments identity,\\"Money, Banking, and Financial Institutions\\", Siklos, pp.145-147, 2006 where: :Current Account Surplus + Capital Account Surplus = Increase in Official Reserve Account A common problem with the balance of payments identity is that, due to measurement error, the balance of payments may not total correctly. For example, in the context of the identity that the sum of all countries' current accounts must be zero, The Economist magazine has noted that \\"In theory, individual countries‚Äô current-account deficits and surpluses should cancel each other out. But because of statistical errors and omissions they never do.\\"\\"The Economist\\", May 27, 2000. Gross domestic product The basic equation for gross domestic product is also an identity, and is sometimes referred to as the National Income Identity:\\"Macroeconomics\\", Auerbach and Kotlikoff, pp. 122-23, 1998 : GDP = consumption + investment + government spending + (exports ‚àí imports). This identity holds because investment refers to the sum of intended and unintended investment, the latter being unintended accumulations of inventories; unintended inventory accumulation necessarily equals output produced (GDP) minus intended uses of that output--consumption, intended investment in machinery, inventories, etc., government spending, and net exports. Investment :Investment = Fixed investment + Inventory investment :Gross investment - Depreciation = Net investment Banking A key identity that is used in explaining the multiple expansion of the money supply is: :Bank assets = Bank liabilities + Owners' equity Here the liabilities include deposits of customers, against which reserves often must be held.

In the software development, it is the management, development, operation and maintenance of IT systems and enterprise architectures with a high quality standard.  Description  Quality engineering is the discipline of engineering that creates and implements strategies for quality assurance in product development and production as well as software development. Quality Engineers focus on optimizing product quality which W. Edwards Deming defined as: ::\\\\text{Quality} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Results of work efforts}}{\\\\text{Total costs}} Quality engineering body of knowledge includes: * Management and leadership * The quality system * Elements of a quality system * Product and process design * Classification of quality characteristics * Design inputs and review * Design verification * Reliability and maintainability * Product and process control * Continuous improvement * Quality control tools * Quality management and planning tools * Continuous improvement techniques * Corrective action * Preventive action * Statistical process control (SPC) * Risk management  Roles  Auditor: Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing their own companies or their suppliers for compliance to international quality standards such as ISO9000 and AS9100. They may also be independent auditors under an auditing body. Process quality: Quality engineers may be tasked with value stream mapping and statistical process control to determine if a process is likely to produce defective product. They may create inspection plans and criteria to ensure defective parts are detected prior to completion. Supplier quality: Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing suppliers or performing root cause and corrective action at their facility or overseeing such activity to prevent the delivery of defective product.  Software  IT services are increasingly interlinked in workflows across platform boundaries, device and organisational boundaries, for example in cyber-physical systems, business-to-business workflows or when using cloud services. In such contexts, quality engineering facilitates the necessary all-embracing consideration of quality attributes. In such contexts an \\"end-to-end\\" view of quality from management to operation is vital. Quality engineering integrates methods and tools from enterprise architecture- management, Software product management, IT service management, software engineering and systems engineering, and from software quality management and information security management. This means that quality engineering goes beyond the classic disciplines of software engineering, information security management or software product management since it integrates management issues (such as business and IT strategy, risk management, business process views, knowledge and information management, operative performance management), design considerations (including the software development process, requirements analysis, software testing) and operative considerations (such as configuration, monitoring, IT service management). In many of the fields where it is used, quality engineering is closely linked to compliance with legal and business requirements, contractual obligations and standards. As far as quality attributes are concerned, reliability, security and safety of IT services play a predominant role. In quality engineering, quality objectives are implemented in a collaborative process. This process requires the interaction of largely independent actors whose knowledge is based on different sources of information. Quality engineering  Quality objectives  Quality objectives describe basic requirements for software quality. In quality engineering they often address the quality attributes of availability, security, safety, reliability and performance. With the help of quality models like ISO/IEC 25000 and methods like the Goal Question Metric approach it is possible to attribute metrics to quality objectives. This allows measuring the degree of attainment of quality objectives. This is a key component of the quality engineering process and, at the same time, is a prerequisite for its continuous monitoring and control. To ensure effective and efficient measuring of quality objectives the integration of core numbers, which were identified manually (e.g. by expert estimates or reviews), and automatically identified metrics (e.g. by statistical analysis of source codes or automated regression tests) as a basis for decision-making is favourable.  Actors  The end-to- end quality management approach to quality engineering requires numerous actors with different responsibilities and tasks, different expertise and involvement in the organisation. Different roles involved in quality engineering: * Business architect, * IT architect, * Security officer, * Requirements engineer, * Software quality manager, * Test manager, * Project manager, * Product manager and * Security architect. Typically, these roles are distributed over geographic and organisational boundaries. Therefore, appropriate measures need to be taken to coordinate the heterogeneous tasks of the various roles in quality engineering and to consolidate and synchronize the data and information necessary in fulfilling the tasks, and to make them available to each actor in an appropriate form.  Knowledge management  Knowledge management plays an important part in quality engineering. The quality engineering knowledge base comprises manifold structured and unstructured data, ranging from code repositories via requirements specifications, standards, test reports, enterprise architecture models to system configurations and runtime logs. Software and system models play an important role in mapping this knowledge. The data of the quality engineering knowledge base are generated, processed and made available both manually as well as tool-based in a geographically, organisationally and technically distributed context. Of prime importance is the focus on quality assurance tasks, early recognition of risks, and appropriate support for the collaboration of actors. This results in the following requirements for a quality engineering knowledge base: * Knowledge is available in a quality as required. Important quality criteria include that knowledge is consistent and up-to-date as well as complete and adequate in terms of granularity in relation to the tasks of the appropriate actors. * Knowledge is interconnected and traceable in order to support interaction between the actors and to facilitate analysis of data. Such traceability relates not only to interconnectedness of data across different levels of abstraction (e.g. connection of requirements with the services realizing them) but also to their traceability over time periods, which is only possible if appropriate versioning concepts exist. Data can be interconnected both manually as well as (semi-) automatically. * Information has to be available in a form that is consistent with the domain knowledge of the appropriate actors. Therefore, the knowledge base has to provide adequate mechanisms for information transformation (e.g. aggregation) and visualization. The RACI concept is an example of an appropriate model for assigning actors to information in a quality engineering knowledge base. * In contexts, where actors from different organisations or levels interact with each other, the quality engineering knowledge base has to provide mechanisms for ensuring confidentiality and integrity. * Quality engineering knowledge bases offer a whole range of possibilities for analysis and finding information in order to support quality control tasks of actors.  Collaborative processes  The quality engineering process comprises all tasks carried out manually and in a (semi-)automated way to identify, fulfil and measure any quality features in a chosen context. The process is a highly collaborative one in the sense that it requires interaction of actors, widely acting independently from each other. The quality engineering process has to integrate any existing sub-processes that may comprise highly structured processes such as IT service management and processes with limited structure such as agile software development. Another important aspect is change-driven procedure, where change events, such as changed requirements are dealt with in the local context of information and actors affected by such change. A pre-requisite for this is methods and tools, which support change propagation and change handling. The objective of an efficient quality engineering process is the coordination of automated and manual quality assurance tasks. Code review or elicitation of quality objectives are examples of manual tasks, while regression tests and the collection of code metrics are examples for automatically performed tasks. The quality engineering process (or its sub-processes) can be supported by tools such as ticketing systems or security management tools.

The Freedom of the City of London can be gained through membership of a livery company or by direct application supported by a suitably qualified proposer and seconder. A limited number of Freemen are admitted each year by the Clerk to the Chamberlain of the City of London during a ceremony at Guildhall. A certificate is presented to the recipient. There is a long-standing tradition of the City admitting women to the Freedom. Although nowadays usually called Freemen as well, the historically correct way of referring to them is Free Sisters.

It is the greatest honour that is in the power of the City of London to bestow, and usually takes place in Guildhall in the presence of the Common Council and the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen, along with invited guests. The most recent recipient, after a gap of some eleven years, was Archbishop Desmond Tutu, with the ceremony taking place at Mansion House in 2013. In 1996 Nelson Mandela, as President of South Africa, received the same honour. The presentation on such occasions is made by the Chamberlain of London, and is often followed by a banquet at Guildhall or Mansion House. Historically, the first personage to be so honoured was William Pitt the Elder in 1757. However, there are also records of the presentation of such in May 1698 to Philemon Philip Carter, son of Nathaniel Carter (goldsmiths) in the \\"Freedom of the City Admission Papers\\" 1681-1930. For many years it was the custom to present the Freedom in specially commissioned and unique gold or silver caskets, the design of which was inspired by the background and the achievements of the individual to which it was presented. More normal today would be to present the honour in the form of a scroll in an inscribed box.

In its original formulation the distribution was expressed referring to the Gompertz distribution instead of the Gumbel distribution but, since the Gompertz distribution is a reverted Gumbel distribution, the labelling can be considered as accurate. It has been used as a model of adoption of innovations. It was proposed by Bemmaor (1994). Some of its statistical properties have been studied further by Jim√©nez and Jodr√° (2009) and Jim√©nez Torres (2014). It has been used to predict the growth and decline of social networks and on-line services and shown to be superior to the Bass model and Weibull distribution (Bauckhage and Kersting 2014).  Specification =Probability density function The probability density function of the shifted Gompertz distribution is: : f(x;b,\\\\eta) = b e^{-bx} e^{-\\\\eta e^{-bx}}\\\\left[1 + \\\\eta\\\\left(1 - e^{-bx}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\text{ for }x \\\\geq 0. \\\\, where b \\\\geq 0 is a scale parameter and \\\\eta \\\\geq 0 is a shape parameter. In the context of diffusion of innovations, b can be interpreted as the overall appeal of the innovation and \\\\eta is the propensity to adopt in the propensity-to-adopt paradigm. The larger b is, the stronger the appeal and the larger \\\\eta is, the smaller the propensity to adopt. The distribution can be reparametrized according to the external versus internal influence paradigm with p = f(0;b,\\\\eta) = be^{-\\\\eta } as the coefficient of external influence and q = b - p as the coefficient of internal influence. Hence: : f(x;p,q) = (p + q) e^{-(p + q)x} e^{-\\\\ln(1 + q/p) e^{-(p+q)x}}\\\\left[1 + \\\\ln(1 + q/p)\\\\left(1 - e^{-(p + q)x}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\text{ for }x \\\\geq 0, p, q \\\\geq 0. \\\\, : = (p + q) e^{-(p + q)x} {(1 + q/p)^{-e^{-(p+q)x}}}\\\\left[1 + \\\\ln(1 + q/p)\\\\left(1 - e^{-(p + q)x}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\text{ for }x \\\\geq 0, p, q \\\\geq 0. \\\\, When q = 0 , the shifted Gompertz distribution reduces to an exponential distribution. When p = 0, the proportion of adopters is nil: the innovation is a complete failure. The shape parameter of the probability density function is equal to q/p . Similar to the Bass model, the hazard rate z(x;p,q) is equal to p when x is equal to 0 ; it approaches p + q as x gets close to \\\\infty. See Bemmaor and Zheng for further analysis. Cumulative distribution function The cumulative distribution function of the shifted Gompertz distribution is: : F(x;b,\\\\eta) = \\\\left(1 - e^{-bx}\\\\right)e^{-\\\\eta e^{-bx}} \\\\text{ for }x \\\\geq 0. \\\\, Equivalently, : F(x;p, q) = \\\\left(1 - e^{-(p + q)x}\\\\right)e^{-\\\\ln(1 + q/p)e^{-(p+q)x}} \\\\text{ for }x \\\\geq 0. \\\\, : = \\\\left(1 - e^{-(p + q)x}\\\\right){(1 + q/p)^{-e^{-(p+q)x}}} \\\\text{ for }x \\\\geq 0. \\\\,  Properties  The shifted Gompertz distribution is right-skewed for all values of \\\\eta. It is more flexible than the Gumbel distribution. The hazard rate is a concave function of F(x;b,\\\\eta) which increases from be^{-\\\\eta} to b : its curvature is all the steeper as \\\\eta is large. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, the effect of word of mouth (i.e., the previous adopters) on the likelihood to adopt decreases as the proportion of adopters increases. (For comparison, in the Bass model, the effect remains the same over time). The parameter q = b(1-e^{-\\\\eta}) captures the growth of the hazard rate when x varies from 0 to \\\\infty. Shapes The shifted Gompertz density function can take on different shapes depending on the values of the shape parameter \\\\eta: * 0 < \\\\eta \\\\leq 0.5\\\\, the probability density function has its mode at 0. * \\\\eta > 0.5\\\\, the probability density function has its mode at ::\\\\text{mode}=-\\\\frac{\\\\ln(z^\\\\star)}{b}\\\\, \\\\qquad 0 < z^\\\\star < 1 :where z^\\\\star\\\\, is the smallest root of ::\\\\eta^2z^2 - \\\\eta(3 + \\\\eta)z + \\\\eta + 1 = 0\\\\,, :which is ::z^\\\\star = [3 + \\\\eta - (\\\\eta^2 + 2\\\\eta + 5)^{1/2}]/(2\\\\eta).  Related distributions  When \\\\eta varies according to a gamma distribution with shape parameter \\\\alpha and scale parameter \\\\beta (mean = \\\\alpha\\\\beta), the distribution of x is Gamma/Shifted Gompertz (G/SG). When \\\\alpha is equal to one, the G/SG reduces to the Bass model (Bemmaor 1994). The three-parameter G/SG has been applied by Dover, Goldenberg and Shapira (2009) and Van den Bulte and Stremersch (2004) among others in the context of the diffusion of innovations. The model is discussed in Chandrasekaran and Tellis (2007).Similar to the shifted Gompertz distribution, the G/SG can either be represented according to the propensity-to-adopt paradigm or according to the innovation-imitation paradigm. In the latter case, it includes three parameters: p, q and \\\\alpha with p = f(0;b,\\\\beta, \\\\alpha) = b/(1+\\\\beta)^{\\\\alpha } and q = b - p . The parameter \\\\alpha modifies the curvature of the hazard rate as expressed as a function of F(x;p,q, \\\\alpha): when \\\\alpha is less than 0.5, it decreases to a minimum prior to increasing at an increasing rate as F(x;p,q, \\\\alpha < 1/2) increases, it is convex when \\\\alpha is less than one and larger or equal to 0.5, linear when \\\\alpha is equal to one, and concave when \\\\alpha is larger than one. Here are some special cases of the G/SG distribution in the case of homogeneity (across the population) with respect to the likelihood to adopt at a given time: F(x;p,q, \\\\alpha = 0) = Exponential(p + q) F(x;p,q, \\\\alpha = 1/2) = Left-skewed two- parameter distribution(p,q) F(x;p,q, \\\\alpha = 1) = Bass model(p,q) F(x;p,q, \\\\alpha = \\\\infty) = Shifted Gompertz(p,q) with: F(x;p, q,\\\\alpha = 1/2) = \\\\left(1 - e^{-(p + q)x}\\\\right)/{(1 + (q/p)(2+q/p)e^{-(p+q)x})^{1/2}} \\\\text{ for }x \\\\geq 0,p, q \\\\geq 0. \\\\, One can compare the parameters p and q across the values of \\\\alpha as they capture the same notions. In all the cases, the hazard rate is either constant or a monotonically increasing function of F(x;p,q, \\\\alpha) (positive word of mouth). As the diffusion curve is all the more skewed as \\\\alpha becomes large, we expect q to decrease as the level of right-skew increases.

Lady Thorneycroft helped establish the Venice in Peril Fund and was a noted philanthropist and patroness of the arts. Early life Carla Maria Concetta Francesca Malagola, Contessa Cappi was the elder daughter of the Italian Count Guido Malagola Cappi and his wife, Alexandra (n√©e Dunbar-Marshall) who had come over with her mother from Natchez, Mississippi to settle in Europe. She was born in Paris, and grew up in Venice, where her paternal grandfather Professor Carlo Malagola of Bologna kept the archives at the Frari basilica, and then in Rome. Her father was an interior designer and a talented photographer. Alexandra and Guido lived in Venice and Rome and Carla was educated by Roman Catholic nuns, along with her siblings, Anna-Viola and Francesco. Francesco, later known as Francis Dunbar Marshall Malagola (1918‚Äì2001), was an artist whose works are conserved in a wide range of European collections and museums. In 1930, Carla and her mother met Major Mervyn Thorneycroft while on holiday on Capri, and later visited his home, Dunston Hall in Staffordshire, where she first met her future second husband, the Major's son, Peter Thorneycroft, newly commissioned in the Royal Artillery. They were quickly engaged, but the engagement was broken off after she returned to Rome. She married Count Giorgio Roberti, in 1934, aged 20, and had a son and a daughter. During the Second World War, she served as a nurse with the Red Cross at the Principessa Piemonte hospital in Rome. Life in England Her marriage was annulled in 1946, and she then took her young children to England. She impressed the Vogue fashion editors with her startling new ideas which they commissioned from her and her forthright attitude won her praise at Vogue. She worked with John Deakin, Cecil Beaton and Norman Parkinson. Her interior design skills and instinctive eye were spotted and she assisted John Fowler and Sybil Colefax to renovate Chevening and worked with Nancy Lancaster. She met Peter Thorneycroft again at a party hosted by Henry \\"Chips\\" Channon. Thorneycroft had become a barrister and been elected as a Conservative MP in 1938. He had been married and divorced. They married in 1949, and she left Vogue in 1951. She was a founder member of the Italian Art and Archives Rescue Fund, which was formed in April 1966 after catastrophic floods in Florence threatened its historic works of art. She was a member of the Fund's first committee, alongside Sir Ashley Clarke (former British ambassador in Italy), John Julius Norwich and Mrs. Natalie Brooke (wife of the secretary of the Royal Academy). Venice was flooded in 1966, and the fund became the Venice in Peril Fund in 1971. She became a member of the Italian Order of Merit in 1967. Meanwhile, her husband held a succession of ministerial positions. He was President of the Board of Trade from 1951‚Äì57, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1957 to 1958, Minister of Aviation from 1960‚Äì62, Minister of Defence and then Secretary of State for Defence from 1962‚Äì64. He left the House of Commons in 1966, and became a life peer in 1967. He was Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1975‚Äì81. She supported his political career, and spoke on his behalf in his re-election campaigns. She was a trustee of the Conservative Winter Ball and its president from 1984 to 1994.

He was famous for scoring a century in his very first match for Tasmania against Queensland at the Gabba in 1978 and a successful team member of the first Tasmanian Cricket Team to win a National Title in the Gillette Cup, and was seen as a potential Australian player. However, after a few inconsistent performances with both the bat and the ball and a serious head injury in 1985, he was overlooked for Test selection. His flashes of brilliance with an electrifying 123 runs against the formidable West Indies attack in 1985 were compounded by his disappointing batting average; only 28 runs per innings for an opening batsman. This didn't cut it for Australian selection, even if he had the ability to score the odd century and the odd half century every 4th innings. His academic (M.Ed, B.Ed.

The settlement was destroyed in the Theran eruption sometime in the 16th century BC and buried in volcanic ash, which preserved the remains of fine frescoes and many objects and artworks. The settlement has been suggested as a possible inspiration for Plato's story of Atlantis. Akrotiri has been excavated since 1967. History The earliest evidence for human habitation of Akrotiri can be traced back as early as the fifth millennium BC, when it was a small fishing and farming village. By the end of the third millennium, this community developed and expanded significantly. One factor for Akrotiri's growth may be the trade relations it established with other cultures in the Aegean, as evidenced in fragments of foreign pottery at the site. Akrotiri's strategic position on the primary sailing route between Cyprus and Minoan Crete also made it an important point for the copper trade, thus allowing it to become an important centre for processing copper, as proven by the discovery of molds and crucibles there. Akrotiri's prosperity continued for about another 500 years; paved streets, an extensive drainage system, the production of high quality pottery and further craft specialization all point to the level of sophistication achieved by the settlement. This all came to an end, however, in the 16th century BC with the volcanic eruption of Thera. There is a variety of dating evidence for the eruption, but its exact year is not known. Radiocarbon dating places it most probably between 1620 and 1530 BC, which is also in accord with the date range of 1570 to 1500 BC suggested by similarities of the material culture with other sites in the Aegean. Unusual growth patterns observed in tree rings in 1597, 1560, 1546 and 1544 BC are consistent with a major volcanic event in any of those years. The latter three dates might be the best candidates as they are also considered possible for Egyptian New Kingdom records that are thought to refer to the eruption. Wide view of excavation Cycladic settlement The Akrotiri excavation site is of a Cycladic cultural settlement on the Greek island of Santorini, associated with the Minoan civilization due to inscriptions in Linear A, and close similarities in artifact and fresco styles.Christos G. Doumas, Thera ‚Äì Pompeii of the Ancient Aegean, London 1983 The excavation is named for a modern village situated on a hill nearby. The name of the site in antiquity is unknown.

Frescoes,Christos G. Doumas, The Wall Paintings of Thera, Athens 1991 pottery, furniture, advanced drainage systems and three-story buildings have been discovered at the site.C. Michael Hogan, Akrotiri, The Modern Antiquarian Excavations The earliest excavations on Santorini were conducted by French geologist F. Fouque in 1867, after some local people found old artifacts at a quarry. Later, in 1895‚Äì1900, the digs by German archeologist Baron Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen revealed the ruins of ancient Thera on Mesa Vouno.Centro universitario europeo per i beni culturali di Ravello, Ancient Buildings and Earthquakes : the Local Seismic Culture Approach. Edipuglia srl, 2005 Also, a little later, R. Zahn excavated in the locality of Potamos, near Akrotiri, under the auspices of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens. Extensive modern excavation was started in 1967 by Spyridon Marinatos and revealed the full value of this site. Marinatos's choice of site proved to be correct and just a few hours into the excavation, the remains of the buried city began to be discovered. The next step was to determine the extent of the city, to which it took two whole seasons devoted to the site in 1967 and 1968. In the early years of the excavation, a great deal of attention was paid towards the organization of proper facilities for the dig, including substantial workshops, laboratories built for storage, repair and treatment and areas for examination of archaeological finds. Because of the site being preserved in thick, volcanic debris, Marinatos noted that many of the buildings were preserved to a height of more than a single story, creating unique challenges for excavation. He experimented with tunneling into the pumice, but this technique was later abandoned. Some historians hold that this settlement, as well as the disaster that left it unknown to most of history, was the inspiration behind Plato's story of Atlantis, as mentioned in his dialogues Timaeus and Critias. Excavated artifacts have been installed in a museum distant from the site (Museum of Prehistoric Thera), with many objects and artworks presented. Only a single gold object has been found, hidden beneath flooring, and no uninterred human skeletal remains have been found. This indicates that an orderly evacuation was performed with little or no loss of life.

Frescoes of Akrotiri Spring flowers and swallows All of the pigments used by the artists at Akrotiri for painting the frescoes look as though they are mineral based and thus have resulted in the great preservation of the pieces. The colors used in Theran painting include white, yellow, red, brown, blue and black. The technique used is not true fresco, except for a few isolated instances, and instead appears as though the painting was begun while the plaster was still wet, but as though the artist made no effort to keep it wet, and seemed content to complete the work on a dry surface. As a result, often on the same fresco, the paint has penetrated the plaster in some areas but flakes off easily in others. Specialized techniques were required when it was discovered early on in the excavation process that the site contained numerous well preserved fresco wall paintings. Tassos Margaritoff, one of the leading restorers of Byzantine frescoes, is currently the supervisor of the Akrotiri project. The first fragments of fresco were discovered in 1968 in Sector Alpha and depict the head of an African, the head of a blue monkey and some large flying blue birds. Akrotiri Minoan town-2 Model of the excavations. In 1969, the fresco of the Blue Monkeys in Room Beta 6 was discovered and created increased excitement at the site. The rocky landscape which the monkeys are depicted climbing upon mimics the similar volcanic rocks near the site presently. In 1970 the Spring Fresco was uncovered in Room Delta 2. It is the first fresco to have been found perfectly preserved and still standing in its original installed position. The supporting wall of the fresco was not in the best condition and thus the fresco had to be removed immediately in order to preserve it. Rescuing the fresco was a delicate procedure and allowed the archaeologists and restorers to develop invaluable experience. A few other frescoes including The Fisherman and the Lady from the House of Ladies have been found standing, though detached from the wall. Objects from Akrotiri The excavations at Akrotiri have produced a large variety of artifacts revealing numerous varieties of Late Cycladic (LC I) pottery from the area. Pottery is the most common and most enduring commodity in the culture of the majority of ancient societies and, thus, is of great importance to archaeologists in interpreting Ancient Greek societies. At Akrotiri, pottery is particularly abundant because of the circumstances surrounding the demise of the town, in that its sudden evacuation meant that inhabitants were only able to take their most valuable possessions with them. Serving a multitude of purposes, pottery can tell a great deal about the society in which it were produced. Large jars were used as containers for storage of goods, while others like stirrup jars were designed for the transportation of certain commodities. As well, there were also vessels for preparing and cooking food, for eating and drinking and many other diverse activities, including bathtubs, braziers, oil lamps, bee-hives, flower pots, etc. Most evidently, the shape, size and perhaps even the decoration of the vases were closely related to their use in the ancient world. In regards to furniture, the volcanic ash which engulfed the city often penetrated into the houses in large quantities and, in these layers of fine volcanic dust, produced negatives of the disintegrated wooden objects. Using these negatives as molds, liquid plaster- of-Paris can be poured in and produce casts of parts, or even entire pieces of furniture such as beds, tables, chairs or stools. Offering tables are one of the most common finds in Akrotiri and were either made of clay or coated with plaster, decorated in the same technique as the wall paintings, and only consisted of three highly decorated legs and a top. Akrotiri today: the connecting path There is a path descending from the first houses of the small city to the parking lot of the excavations of Akrotiri, connecting the old excavation site to the town of Akrotiri. The path was signposted and reopened in September 2012 and now regularly undergoes maintenance, thanks to international volunteers. The local population has been the first supporter of this initiative and in charge of the upkeep of the path, working alongside the volunteers. The path is suitable for mountain biking, hiking and many other activities.

It is used to create a watertight roof covering to protect the interior of a building. Membrane roofs are most commonly made from synthetic rubber, thermoplastic (PVC or similar material), or modified bitumen. Membrane roofs are most commonly used in commercial application, though they are becoming increasingly common in residential application. Types Synthetic Rubber (Thermoset) ‚Äì This type of membrane roof is made of large, flat pieces of synthetic rubber or similar materials. These pieces are bonded together at the seams to form one continuous membrane. The finished roof‚Äôs thickness is usually between 30 and 60 mils(thousandths of an inch) (0.75 mm to 1.50 mm). The most commonly used thermoset membrane is EPDM. Other types of related materials are CSPE, CR, and ECR. Thermosets are widely used roofing materials due to their ability to withstand damaging effects of sun-rays and chemicals found on roofs. Thermoplastic Membrane ‚Äì This is similar to synthetic rubber, but the seams are typically heat-fused (welded) to form a continuous membrane. The 'lap' seams can also be fused with solvents instead of heat, and can be as strong as the rest of the membrane. Other related materials are CPA, CPE, EIP, NBP, PIB, and TPO. Thermoplastic membranes include a reinforcement layer that provides more strength and stability. The most common thermoplastic membranes are PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin). Modified Bitumen ‚Äì This type of roofing is an evolution of asphalt roofing. It is made from asphalt and a variety of rubber modifiers and solvents. There are several ways of connecting pieces of this material. In a heat application process the seams are heated to melt the asphalt together and create a seal. There is also hot-mopped application, similar to how conventional built-up roofs are installed. Cold-applied adhesives and self-adhesive membranes are two of the more recent options. Copolymers commonly used to modify asphalt include atactic polypropylene (APP), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene- butadiene rubber (SBR), and styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS). Advantages Over Asphalt Flat Roofing Systems These three application types of membrane roofing show distinct advantages over the previously more common flat roofing method of asphalt and gravel. In asphalt and gravel application, it can be very difficult to create a proper seal at all seams and connection points. This can cause a roof to leak early in its lifespan, and require much more maintenance. When installed correctly, newer materials are either seamless, or have seams as strong as the body. This eliminates most of the leakage concerns associated with flat roofing systems. Repairs for asphalt and gravel roofs can be problematic, largely because it is difficult to locate the exact point of a leak. Newer systems can be patched relatively easily because breaks and leaks are easier to locate. Originally asphalt roofing required a layer of gravel above it for two reasons. First, asphalt with direct exposure to sunlight degrades much faster, mainly due to the expansion and contraction throughout a day, and also the damage created by UV rays. Secondly, asphalt needs weight above to hold it down, because it sits on the top of a building, instead of being attached to it. Each of the three newer types of membrane roofing systems contain materials that resist expansion and contraction, as well as reflect much of the UV rays. Also, because these membranes either lack seams or have strong seams, what expansion and contraction does occur does not create leaks and breaks at these seams. These newer roofing systems are also attached directly to the top of a building, which eliminates the need for excess weight above.

It was founded in 1989. It is maintained through a network of volunteers and a full-time staff of five people. Their services include public education and awareness, quarterly newsletters, national networking, an annual convention, disorder specific brochures, and a Kids Program. The foundation has a membership network in excess of 25,000 families. The disorders MAGIC families have are grouped into primary categories. They include: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, precocious puberty, growth hormone deficiency (both adults and children), panhypopituitarism, McCune-Albright syndrome, Turner syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, thyroid disorders (both congenital and acquired), optic nerve hypoplasia, and other rare disorders.  Educational programs  MAGIC offers a national educational program every year for the families of affected children and another for affected adults. Physicians specialising in these disorders, from all over the world, volunteer to speak to and assist the children and affected adults. They also offer a weekly email with links to recently published medical information to parents of children impacted by Small for Gestational Age babies, Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, McCune-Albright Syndrome, Russell-Silver Syndrome (also known as Silver- Russell Syndrome), Optic Nerve Hypoplasia, Septo Optic Dysplasia, Hypophosphatasia, and others.  Controversy  The MAGIC Foundation received significant funding from Genentech and Eli Lilly. It was thought that the money was to undertake case finding of children with short stature who might benefit from their human growth hormone treatments. The US Food and Drug Administration investigated Genentech in 1992 and 1994 for using numerous charities to improperly advertise this medication. None of the monies donated to either the Human Growth Foundation nor The Magic foundation were donated with any stipulations as to how the money was to be utilized. The donations were support funds for the patients affected.
